Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the prognostic value of baseline neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in
the prediction of long-term mortality in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
Methods: This prospective study recorded NLR during initial diagnostic right-sided cardiac
catheterization in adult patients with PAH. Demographic, clinical, laboratory and haemo-
dynamic variables were compared by NLR tertile. Univariate and multivariate Cox regres-
sion analyses were used to determine whether NLR was independently associated with
mortality.
Results: Adults with PAH (n ¼ 101) were followed-up for mean Æ SD 36.8 Æ 23.6 months. The
number of deaths, New York Heart Association functional capacity (NYHA FC), levels of brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP) or C-reactive protein (CRP) and presence of pericardial effusion
increased as the NLR tertile increased, but haemoglobin and tricuspid plane annular systolic
excursion (TAPSE) decreased. On univariate analysis, high NLR values were associated with
mortality, but on multivariate analysis, NLR did not remain an independent predictor of mortality.
Baseline NYHA FC, TAPSE, BNP level and pericardial effusion were independent predictors of
mortality.
Conclusions: NLR was correlated with important prognostic markers in PAH such as NYHA FC,
BNP and TAPSE. This simple marker may be useful in the assessment of disease severity in patients
with PAH.

Introduction
Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a
relatively rare condition, often accompanied
by a poor outcome due to right heart
failure.1 The median survival period of
patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) was
2.8 years in the initial reports from a
national US prospective registry.2 In the
past two decades, survival has improved as
treatment options have increased.3 Data
from the US REVEAL registry suggest
that the current median survival is 7 years
for patients with any form of PAH.4
Identifying clinically-relevant prognostic
predictors has been a key goal for clinicians
involved in the care of patients with PAH.
Several prognostic models have been inves-
tigated by the large disease registries. For
example, the latest update from the 5th PAH
World Symposium (held in Nice, France, in
2013) outlined the multivariate predictors of
survival as follows: male sex, age > 65 years,
PAH secondary to connective tissue disease,
high New York Heart Association func-
tional class (NYHA FC), low 6-min walking
distance (6MWD), high levels of brain
natriuretic peptide (BNP) or the N-terminal
of the prohormone brain natriuretic peptide,
high creatinine levels, presence of pericardial
effusion on echocardiography, low diffusing
capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide
(DLCO
), high right atrial pressure (RAP),
low cardiac output (CO) and high pulmon-
ary vascular resistance (PVR).5 Research
has also identified several biomarkers to be
prognostic predictors in PAH, including
levels of bilirubin, platelets, uric acid, tropo-
nin or C-reactive protein (CRP, and red cell
distribution width.6
Inflammation has long been recognized as
an important pathogenic element in PAH.7
Stacher et al.8 reported the accumulation of
inflammatory cells in PAH for the first time
in 2012. In this study, the amount of peri-
vascular inflammatory infiltrate correlated
with parameters of pulmonary vascular
remodelling and haemodynamics in PAH.8
Among several inflammatory markers, neu-
trophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a
simple and popular marker, which has been
shown to be correlated with the prognosis of
several disease states in cardiology including
heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarc-
tion (AMI), coronary artery disease (CAD),
infective endocarditis and acute pulmonary
embolism.9­13 One study showed for the first
time that the NLR was significantly
increased in patients with PAH compared
with control subjects.14 To our knowledge,
NLR has not been studied in terms of patient
prognosis in PAH. This present study there-
fore evaluated the prognostic value of base-
line NLR in patients with PAH.
Patients and methods
Patients
Consecutive adult patients with definitive
PAH who attended the PAH Clinic,
Department of Cardiology, School of
Medicine, Dokuz Eylul University, Izmir,
Turkey between January 2008 and June
2014, were prospectively screened for inclu-
sion in this prospective study. All patients
met the diagnostic criteria for the definitive
diagnosis of PAH.15 The Dokuz Eylul
University Ethics Committee approved the
study protocol (no. 2138-GOA). Verbal
informed consent was obtained from all of
the study participants. Patients with overt
infectious disease at the time of PAH diag-
nosis (i.e. at the beginning of the screening
process) were excluded from the study.

Data collection and patient survival
Baseline evaluation of the patients included
the following: NYHA FC assessment,16
transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), rou-
tine laboratory tests, BNP, 6MWD, echo-
cardiogram, and right-heart catheterization
(RHC). BNP was measured using a chemi-
luminescence microparticle immunometric
method (ARCHITECT c4000 Clinical
Chemistry Analyser; Abbott Laboratories,
Abbott Park, IL, USA). A Beckman Coulter
LH 780 Haematology Analyser (Beckman
Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) was used to under-
take the haematological analysis, which was
used to determine the baseline NLR for each
patient at hospital admission. For haemato-
logical analysis, a sample (3 ml) of venous
blood was collected from each patient in
tubes containing 6% ethylenediaminetetra-
acetic acid; samples were stored at room
temperature for 20­25 min before analysis.
Blood analyses undertaken during the diag-
nostic RHC were recorded as baseline bio-
chemical data. RHC was performed at rest,
without sedation, by an experienced cardi-
ologist (B.A.). Measurements of pulmonary
artery pressure (PAP), RAP and wedged
PAP were taken at end-expiration. CO was
measured by an indirect Fick method with an
assumed O2
consumption of the patient.17
Cardiac index (CI) was calculated as CO
divided by body surface area. Pulmonary
vascular resistance was calculated as mean
PAP minus left atrial pressure divided by
CO. The survival period was calculated as
the number of months from initial diagnosis
to June 2014, which was the end of the
follow-up period in this study, or to patient
death if that occurred first.
Two-dimensional Doppler
echocardiography
All patients had a comprehensive two-
dimensional Doppler echocardiography
examination with a special focus on
right heart functions and pressures.
Echocardiograms were performed by two
experienced cardiologists (B.A. and E.O
¨ .)
using a Philips HD11 XE ultrasound system
with a 3.2 MHz transducer (Philips
Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands). The
following parameters were measured
during TTE: systolic PAP, right ventricular
(RV) end-diastolic diameter, right atrial
area, maximum systolic velocity of pulmon-
ary outflow jet, tricuspid plane annular
systolic excursion (TAPSE), RV tissue
Doppler systolic velocity, RV fractional
area change (RFAC) and RV Tei index.18
RFAC was calculated as RV end diastolic
area (RVEDA) minus RV end systolic area
divided by RVEDA, in which measurements
were obtained from the apical four-chamber
view. At the apical four-chamber view,
M-mode recording of the long axis was
taken from the lateral side of the tricuspid
annulus. The maximal distance of endocar-
dial motion during the systolic phase was
defined as TAPSE. The tissue Doppler
imaging was used to obtain RV velocities
in the apical four-chamber view with a 2-mm
sample volume placed at the lateral segment
of the tricuspid annulus during early diastole
and systole. The isovolumetric contraction
time (IVCT) and isovolumetric relaxation
time (IVRT) were measured from the end of
the tricuspid annular velocity pattern to the
onset of the systolic wave, and from the end
of the systolic wave to the onset of the
tricuspid annular velocity pattern, respect-
ively. The ejection time (ET) was defined as
the duration of the systolic wave. The RV
Tei index was calculated according to the
formula: Tei index ¼ (IVCT þ IVRT)/ET.
Using the modified Bernoulli equation, an
estimate of the RAP is added to the peak
systolic gradient of the tricuspid regurgitant
jet to approximate systolic PAP (sPAP) in
the absence of pulmonary valve stenosis.
The presence of pericardial effusion during
TTE was also noted.
Patients were followed-up periodically at
3-month intervals. Follow-up visits included
O
¨ zpelit et al. 663
a physical examination, NYHA FC assess-
ment, BNP testing, 6MWD, routine labora-
tory testing and comprehensive TTE. Based
on the NLR upon admission, patients were
stratified into tertiles: 1st tertile: 2.2; 2nd
tertile: 2.3­3.5; and 3rd tertile: ! 3.6.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 15.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. To test the distribution pattern,
the Kolmogorov­Smirnov method was
used. Data are summarized as the
mean Æ SD, median (minimum, maximum),
or n of patients (%). Analysis of variance
was used to compare data between the
tertiles displaying normal distribution.
Kruskal­Wallis test was applied to compare
the data without normal distribution
between the tertiles. Mann­Whitney U-test
was used to compare the data without
normal distribution between patients who
had died and patients who had survived
during follow-up. Categorical parameters
were compared with 2-test. Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient analysis was
used to analyse the correlation between
numeric variables. The effects of different
parameters on clinical outcomes were calcu-
lated by univariate analysis for each.
Parameters for which the unadjusted
P-value was <0.10 in the univariate analysis
were identified as potential risk markers,
and were included in the multivariate Cox
logistic regression model. A P-value 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
Results
A total of 101 patients (mean Æ SD age,
52.7 Æ 18.5 years; range, 18­88 years) with a
definitive diagnosis of PAH were included in
the study. The mean Æ SD follow-up of the
study population was 36.8 Æ 23.6 months.
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of
patients stratified according to the three
NLR tertiles. Mean age and sex did not
differ significantly across the three NLR
tertiles. Neutrophil counts were significantly
higher (P ¼ 0.006 for trend across the three
NLR tertiles), whereas lymphocyte counts
were significantly lower (P < 0.001 for trend
across the three NLR tertiles) with increas-
ing NLR tertile. The NYHA FC of the
patients increased significantly with increas-
ing NLR tertile (P < 0.001).
A higher prevalence of pericardial effu-
sion was observed as the NLR tertile
increased (P < 0.001 for trend across the
three NLR tertiles). Among the RV echo-
cardiographic parameters, only TAPSE dif-
fered significantly across the tertiles, with
TAPSE being lower with increasing NLR
tertile (P ¼ 0.002).
Right-heart catheterization parameters
were similar among the three NLR tertiles,
including systolic pulmonary artery pressure
measured on right-heart catheterization
(sPAPRHC
), mean pulmonary artery pres-
sure measured on right-heart catheterization
(mPAPRHC
), PVR and CI. Among the bio-
chemical parameters, BNP levels were sig-
nificantly higher (P ¼ 0.001) and
haemoglobin levels were significantly lower
with increasing NLR tertile (P ¼ 0.027). The
CRP level significantly increased as the
NLR tertile increased (P ¼ 0.019). There
was a significant correlation between CRP
and NLR (r ¼ 0.702, P < 0.001; Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient analysis).
A total of 32 deaths occurred during the
study period, the majority (n ¼ 30) of which
were confirmed to be related to worsening
right heart failure; for the remaining two
patients, cause of death was undetermined
from the relatives. When patients were
stratified into two groups according to the
occurrence of death, those who had died had
a significantly higher median NLR value
(3.9 versus 2.7, respectively; P ¼ 0.003),
higher median neutrophil counts (6.8
versus 5.0 Â 103/ml, respectively; P ¼ 0.001)
664 Journal of International Medical Research 43(5)
and similar median lymphocyte counts (1.4
versus 1.8 Â 103/ml, respectively) compared
with those who survived (Figure 1).
The associations of different baseline
parameters with long-term mortality were
evaluated by univariate analysis (Table 2).
Parameters for which the unadjusted
P-value was <0.10 in the univariate analysis
were identified as potential risk markers and
were included in the full multivariate Cox
logistic regression model. CRP was excluded
from the multivariate analysis because NLR

and CRP were significantly correlated with
each other. For long-term mortality, base-
line NLR, BNP, 6MWD, TAPSE, the pres-
ence of pericardial effusion, NYHA FC and
haemoglobin were analysed using a multi-
variate Cox logistic regression model.
Multivariate Cox logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that baseline BNP, TAPSE,
NYHA FC and the presence of pericardial
effusion emerged as independent predictors
of long-term mortality. NLR, 6MWD, and
haemoglobin did not remain as independent
predictors of death (Table 2).
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
analysis demonstrated that baseline NLR
was significantly correlated with NYHA FC
(r ¼ 0.421, P < 0.001), BNP (r ¼ 0.362,
P < 0.001), and TAPSE (r ¼ À0.275,
P ¼ 0.007). Echocardiographic parameters
(other than TAPSE), right-heart catheter-
ization parameters and 6MWD were not
correlated with baseline NLR.
Discussion
This present study investigated the value of
baseline NLR in the prediction of mortality
in patients with PAH. These present results
showed that although NLR was a significant
predictor of long-term mortality in the
univariate analysis, the multivariate Cox
logistic regression analysis did not support
its significance in the prediction of long-term
mortality. Baseline NLR was significantly
correlated with baseline NYHA FC, BNP
and TAPSE of patients with PAH. In this
present study, independent predictors of
long-term mortality were baseline NYHA
FC, TAPSE, BNP and presence of pericar-
dial effusion on echocardiography.
Significant correlations between the baseline
NLR and these well-known prognostic fac-
tors limited its value as an independent
predictor of death in patients with PAH.
However, these results suggest that NLR
may be useful in the assessment of disease
severity in patients with PAH.
The prognostic value of NLR has been
studied in many disease states including
AMI, CAD, HF, infective endocarditis,
acute pulmonary embolism, type 2 diabetes
mellitus and several cancers.9­13,19­22 This
present study was the first to investigate the
prognostic role of baseline NLR in patients
with PAH. Inflammation has been long
recognized as an important pathogenic
element in PAH.7 It has become increasingly
clear that early and persistent inflammation
is present and contributes to pulmonary
vascular disease, as documented in tissue-
based studies and in studies of circulating
inflammatory cells and chemical medi-
ators.23­25 A wide range of cytokines has
been shown to be elevated and to correlate
with survival in PAH; such cytokines
include interleukin-6, monocyte chemo-
attractant protein-1, tumour necrosis
factor-a, transforming growth factor-b and
5-hydroxytryptophan.26 At the tissue level,
traditional cellular components of inflam-
mation are described in the hypertensive
pulmonary circulation.27 The cells involved
have been shown to be mostly T cells,
macrophages, and, to a lesser extent, B
cells.27 Although T cell infiltrates are
increased in patients with IPAH, it appears
that there is a decrease in CD8þ cytotoxic T
cells and an increase in regulatory T cells.27
Regulatory T cells are now believed to play a
pivotal role in the development of PAH.28
Although T cells have been one of the major
points of focus in PAH pathophysiology,
little is known about the role of neutrophils
in PAH development.29 Neutrophils are the
most abundant white blood cells; they
release various enzymes and cytokines, and
activate other cells of the immune system to
trigger and enhance inflammatory reac-
tions.30 After an acute infection or tissue
destruction, the lymphocyte count declines
and the neutrophil count rises, which
leads to an increase in the NLR.31 Previous
studies reported that both lymphopenia and
neutrophilia were independently associated
O
¨ zpelit et al. 667
with severity of infectious disease and degree
of tissue damage.32 Recent evidence suggests
that the NLR provides a higher predictive
value than the stand-alone leukocyte differ-
ential because by itself the NLR can reflect,
in a synergistic manner, more about disease
severity than either of the former leukocyte
subgroups alone.32,33 Currently, the NLR
has also been proposed as a strong prog-
nostic indicator for worse cardiovascular
outcomes in a variety of settings. For
example, studies investigating the NLR in
patients with cardiovascular disease showed
that a higher preprocedural NLR was an
independent predictor of adverse outcomes
in patients undergoing coronary angiog-
raphy, percutaneous coronary intervention,
and coronary bypass grafting.34­36 A higher
NLR predicts mortality in stable coronary
heart disease, acute coronary syndromes,
and HF.9­11
Among the inflammatory mediators pro-
duced by neutrophils, superoxide anions,
elastase and 5-lipooxygenase products of
arachidonic acid potentially have important
effects on lung vascular inflammatory and
remodelling processes.37,38 To the authors'
knowledge, only one study in the literature
has investigated the role of neutrophils in
PAH.29 This study demonstrated that neu-
trophils isolated from patients with IPAH
and patients with chronic thromboembolic
pulmonary hypertension showed an
enhanced mediator release (superoxide
anion, elastase, leukotriene A4, leukotriene
B4 and 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid)
compared with healthy control subjects
when challenged with different stimulatory
agents.29 The exact role played by neutro-
phils in the PAH process remains unknown.
Research has demonstrated that hypoxia
causes a profound inhibition of neutrophil
apoptosis.39 Hence, the neutrophil appears
to be remarkably well adapted to survive
and function under oxygen-depleted envir-
onments such as those experienced in PAH.
Regarding the value of NLR and circulating
leukocyte subtypes in PAH, there appears to
be only one study in the literature:14 this
study showed that NLR was significantly
higher in patients with PAH compared with
the healthy control subjects.14 When exam-
ined separately, patients with PAH showed
similar neutrophil counts but lower lympho-
cyte counts compared with healthy control
subjects, but this study did not investigate
the prognostic value of NLR in PAH.14 The
present study is therefore the first to be
published in the literature investigating the
role of NLR in predicting survival in
patients with PAH. The results from our
study showed that the baseline NLR was
significantly higher in patients who died
during the follow-up period compared with
those who survived, and that this higher
NLR was due to a higher neutrophil count
and a similar lymphocyte count compared
with the survivors. The NLR was signifi-
cantly correlated with important prognostic
factors such as NYHA FC, BNP and
TAPSE. Multivariate Cox logistic regres-
sion analysis did not demonstrate the pre-
dictive role of NLR in the long-term
mortality of patients with PAH. This was
most likely due to the significant correlation
between NLR and other significant pre-
dictors of mortality in PAH (such as
NYHA FC, BNP and TAPSE). In this
current study, the independent predictors
of long-term mortality were baseline NYHA
FC, TAPSE, BNP and the presence of
pericardial effusion on echocardiography.
These mortality predictors in PAH were
consistent with those previously reported in
the published literature.3 At the 5th PAH
World Symposium held in 2013, prognostic
markers in PAH were outlined according to
data from large registries and were reported
as follows: male sex, age > 65 years, PAH
secondary to connective tissue disease,
high NYHA FC, low 6MWD, high BNP
or the N-terminal of the prohormone
brain natriuretic peptide, high creatinine
levels, presence of pericardial effusion in

echocardiography, low DLCO
, high RAP,
low CO and high PVR.5 As a consequence of
the limited size of the patient population in
the current study, the mortality predictors
did not include all of the above parameters,
but those that were evaluated were among
the most powerful predictors of mortality, as
demonstrated by many large studies and
registries.5,40
This present study had a number of
limitations. First, it was a single-centre
study, which meant that the study sample
comprised patients cared for by a single
tertiary referral practice. In addition, the
sample size was small and there was a
limited number of deaths during the
follow-up period. Secondly, the study was
designed to assess the relationship between
the baseline NLR at the time of diagnosis
and long-term mortality, so analyses were
based solely on blood-test results measured
on hospital admission, at the point of diag-
nosis. Despite adjusting for multiple risk
factors, it is possible that there might have
been residual confounding conditions and
medications.
In conclusion, the present study showed
that NLR, a promising marker of inflam-
mation in other disease states, was corre-
lated with important prognostic markers
(such as NYHA FC, BNP and TAPSE) in
patients with PAH. NLR was also signifi-
cantly associated with long-term mortality,
however it was not found to be an inde-
pendent predictor of long-term mortality in
this PAH population due to its correlation
with other prognostic factors. Significant
correlations between baseline NLR and
other prognostic factors suggests that this
simple marker may be useful in the assess-
ment of disease severity in patients with
PAH; this would be an easy, widely avail-
able and inexpensive test to undertake.
These current data suggest that the level of
inflammation may be directly associated
with disease severity and prognosis in
PAH, but this needs to be confirmed in
larger prospective studies. Understanding
the exact role of the inflammatory pathway
in the PAH pathogenesis may lead to new
therapeutic approaches.
