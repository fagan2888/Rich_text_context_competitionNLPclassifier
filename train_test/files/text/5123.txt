Abstract: Sex differences in reaction to a romantic partner's infidelity are well
documented and are hypothesized to be attributable to sex-specific jealousy mechanisms
that solve sex specific adaptive problems. There have been few cognitive-based
investigations of jealousy, however. Here we investigated sex differences in implicit
processing of jealousy-based information. In Experiment 1, we used the implicit
association test (IAT) to investigate sex-differentiated biases in classifying sexual or
emotional infidelity information as being positive or negative. Men made significantly
more errors when asked to classify as pleasant, words indicating sexual infidelity. In
Experiment 2, we modified the Stroop task to include words that depicted infidelity-related
topics in three priming conditions: sexual infidelity priming, emotional infidelity priming,
and a no priming control. Men were significantly slower to respond after being primed with
sexual infidelity scenarios. The effect of sexual infidelity priming was not word-category
specific, suggesting that cognition about a partner's sexual infidelity hijacks general
cognitive and attentional processing. These findings suggest that men may automatically
classify information about sexual infidelity as negative and that the automatic negative
processing of sexual infidelity takes precedent over other types of immediate cognition.

Jealousy-based cognition
Introduction
Jealousy is a leading cause of female-directed intimate partner abuse, rape, and
homicide (Daly and Wilson, 1988; Shackelford and Goetz, 2006). About 1.5 million
women are raped or physically assaulted by an intimate partner each year in the United
States and 8% of women report having been stalked by an intimate partner at some point in
their lives (Tjaden and Thoennes, 1998a; 1998b). It has been hypothesized that men's
jealous, controlling and sometimes violent behavior may have evolved to prevent or punish
a partner's defection from the relationship (see Buss, 2002, for review).
Humans engage in "social monogamy," whereby males and females form
partnerships and cooperate to raise offspring. Social monogamy may have evolved in
humans because of the need for bi-parental investment in altricial offspring. Social
monogamy does not imply genetic monogamy, however. In fact, genetic monogamy is the
exception rather than the rule in the animal kingdom (e.g., Morell, 1998). Social
monogamy has been defined by Gillette, Jaeger, and Peterson (2000, p.1241), "as occurring
when two heterosexual adults, exclusive of kin directed behavior, direct significantly less
aggression and significantly more submission towards each other, and/or spend
significantly more time associating with each other relative to other adult heterosexual
conspecifics." In humans, social monogamy typically leads to marriage. Today, marriage is
prevalent in every known culture and so, too, is infidelity (Anderson, 2006; Bellis, Hughes,
Hughes and Ashton, 2005; Brown, 1991; Epstein and Guttman, 1984; Platek and
Shackelford, 2006; Shackelford, LeBlanc and Drass, 2000; Vandenberg, 1972).
The occurrence of human extra-pair paternity varies widely, from 1-30%, with the
best estimate near 10% (Anderson 2006; Bellis et al., 2005; Baker and Bellis, 1995; Cerda-
Flores, Barton, Marty-Gonzales, Rivas and Chakbroty, 1999; Neale, Neale, and Sullivan,
2002; Sasse, Muller, Chakbroty, and Ott, 1994; Sykes and Irven, 2000). To avoid being
cuckolded--being deceived into investing resources in a child which one has not sired--
men may have evolved a number of anti-cuckoldry tactics (Gallup and Burch, 2006; Platek
and Shackelford, 2006), one of which is mate guarding. Mate guarding refers to the process
of safeguarding access to a mate as well as preventing other males from infringing on their
significant other (Buss, 1988). This practice has been observed in a variety of species,
especially where parental investment by both parents is likely or common. Several
evolutionary scientists have theorized that jealousy has evolved as a mate guarding tactic to
help ensure that one's partner does not abandon the partnership, either temporarily (e.g.,
infidelity) or permanently (e.g., divorce; Buss 1988; Buss and Shackelford, 1997; Flinn,
1988). Examples of mate guarding include a broad range of behaviors including making
oneself more attractive for one's partner to physically harmful acts such as domestic
violence. These tactics may be driven by reproductive (genetic) fitness gains/losses and
ultimately aid a male's confidence in paternity. If males are unsuccessful at preventing
infidelity by their mate, they risk genetic cuckoldry (Buss, 2002) and might therefore
provision offspring which share no genes in common with him. Females who are not
successful at mate guarding can also incur risks. For example, unsuccessful mate guarding
by a female could lead to loss of resource investment by the male (e.g., diversion of
financial and other resources to other sexual partners). Furthermore, social resources in the

form of alliances brought to the relationship by one partner may be lost due to breakup
(Buss, 2002).
Sex differences in reaction to a partner's emotional and sexual infidelity are well
documented and are hypothesized to be attributable to recurrent sex-specific adaptive
problems (Buss, Larsen, Westen, and Semmelroth, 1992; Buss and Shackelford, 1997;
Platek and Thomson, 2007; Shackelford et al., 2004). Because of the adaptive problem of
paternal uncertainty, men more than women are upset by a partner's sexual infidelity (e.g.,
having sex with someone else). Because of the adaptive concern with parental investment
and resource diversion, women are more upset than men by a partner's emotional infidelity
(e.g., falling in love with someone else; Buss et al., 1992; Buss and Shackelford 1997;
Shackelford et al. 2000). In Buss et al.'s (1992) landmark study, participants were asked to
imagine a romantic partner engaging in a sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity, and to
select which of the two would be more upsetting. Although Buss et al.'s (1992) hypotheses
and results have been criticized (Buller, 2005; DeSteno, Bartlett, Braverman, and Salovey,
2002; DeSteno and Salovey, 1996; Harris, 2000, 2003a, 2003b), there is a growing
consensus that these findings are robust (see Buss and Haselton, 2005; Shackelford, Buss,
and Bennett, 2002; Shackelford et. al, 2004; Strout, Laird, Shafer, and Thompson, 2005;
Wiederman and Kendall, 1999). There is a growing number of studies, including cross-
cultural studies and psychophysiological studies, that have provided convergent support for
the evolutionary hypothesis of sex differences in jealousy (see Buunk, Angleitner, Oubaid,
and Buss, 1996; Buss and Shackelford 1997; Buss, et al.,1999; de Weerth and Kalma,
1993; Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens and Thompson, 2002; Sagarin, Becker, Guadagno, Nicastle,
and Millevoi, 2003; Schützwohl, 2004; Schützwohl and Koch, 2004; Schützwohl, 2006;
Shackelford et al. 2000; Wiederman and Allgeier, 1993; Wiederman and Kendall, 1999).
However, only a few studies have investigated the possible cognitive mechanisms involved
in jealousy-based information processing.
Schützwohl (2004) replicated Buss et al.'s (1992) study, substituting self-report
surveys with a computerized task in which reaction times were assessed. Although both
men and women reported greater upset to emotional infidelity scenarios, more men than
women selected a partner's sexual infidelity as more upsetting. Women selecting emotional
infidelity as more upsetting reached their decision faster than women selecting sexual
infidelity. In contrast, men selecting sexual infidelity as more upsetting reached their
decision faster than men selecting emotional infidelity as more upsetting.
Schützwohl and Koch (2004) investigated the ability to recall cues to sexual and
emotional infidelities. Participants were presented one of several stories about a couple
spending an evening together. The stories were presented so that infidelity appeared to be
neither very likely nor very unlikely. A week later, participants returned to the lab and were
unexpectedly asked to recall what they remembered from the story. Men recalled more cues
to sexual infidelity and women recalled more of cues to emotional infidelity. In a follow up
study, Schützwohl (2005) investigated thresholds of jealous feelings. Participants were
presented cues signaling either a mate's sexual or emotional infidelity and were asked to
indicate which cue to infidelity elicited "a first sign of feeling jealous" and to indicate
which cue would cause them to reply "I won't take it any longer. My jealousy feeling is
intolerable" while reaction times were recorded. There were no sex differences found with
regard to the number of cues to sexual or emotional infidelity until the first threshold. After
the first feeling of jealousy had been identified, men needed fewer cues to sexual infidelity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(3). 2007. -571-
Jealousy-based cognition
and women needed fewer cues to emotional infidelity until the second threshold. Men were
significantly faster in determining the two thresholds for sexual infidelity and women were
faster for cues to emotional infidelity.
Here we used two different tasks to investigate the cognitive-emotional aspects of a
putative jealousy mechanism. We used the implicit associations test (IAT; see Greenwald,
McGhee, and Schwartz, 1998; Greenwald, Nosek, and Banaji, 2003) to measure implicit
associations when participants were asked to categorize words depicting sexual infidelity or
emotional infidelity as either positive or negative. Guided by an evolutionary psychological
perspective, we predicted a sex-specific reaction time advantage and performance
decrement associated with categorizing different types of infidelity-related words as
positive or negative. Specifically, we predicted that men would show greater bias (slower
reaction time and increased error rate) to words depicting sexual jealousy and that women
would show greater bias to words depicting emotional infidelity.
In a second experiment, we modified the Stroop task to measure cognitive effects
when primed with infidelity scenarios. The Stroop task has been shown to be a reliable
assessment of measuring attentional bias (Williams, Matthews, and MacLeod, 1996) and
results of modified Stroop tasks have shown slowed reaction time to emotionally provoking
stimuli (Egolf and Schmuckle, 2004; Intili and Tarrier, 1998; Lusher, Chandler, and Ball,
2004). Due to the competing information processing tapping attention, we predicted that
men would have slower reaction times and commit more errors when primed with a sexual
infidelity scenario and that women would have slower reaction times and commit more
errors when primed with an emotional infidelity scenario.
Materials and Methods
Experiment 1: Implicit Association to Infidelity-Related Words
Participants
Sixty-nine undergraduates (34 men; 35 women, M age = 20.4) from a Northeastern
United States university volunteered for participation. All participants gave written
informed consent and received course extra credit for their participation. The study was
approved by the local Institutional Review Board.
Apparatus and Procedures
Stimuli were presented to participants on a Gateway desktop with a 15" monitor.
Participants were seated 35-40 cm away from the screen. The experiment was run using
Presentation® software (Version 0.70, www.neuro-bs.com). In individual sessions,
participants were administered a version of the Implicit Association Test (IAT; see
Greenwald et al., 1998, and Greenwald et al., 2003). The IAT is a reaction time task used to
assess implicit associations between social categories (e.g., race) and semantic concepts
(e.g., unpleasantness). Implicit attitudes are thought to be manifest actions or judgments
that are under the control of automatically activated evaluations without the performer's
awareness of that causation (Greenwald and Banaji, 1995). The reasoning behind using the
IAT in measuring reactions to jealousy information is that it should be easier for one to
categorize words typically associated together than it would be for dissimilar words. For
example, it would be easier to categorize the word "flower" with the category of pleasant,
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(3). 2007. -572-
Jealousy-based cognition
than say the word "death." We used the IAT to investigate sex differences when engaging
in a modified version of the IAT designed to investigate sex-specific adaptive processing of
upset to a partner's infidelity. When the stimuli produce cognitive dissonance, longer
reaction times and increased number of errors result. We modified the IAT to include
presentation of stimulus words differentially associated with sexual infidelity or with
emotional infidelity (e.g. abandonment, unfaithful, extramarital, affair, unromantic). For
example, if "adultery" is associated with sexual infidelity, than we predicted that men
would be slower to categorize the word "adultery" with the category Positive + Sexual
Infidelity than they would be to categorize it in the Negative + Sexual Infidelity category.
Twenty words related to infidelity were rated by 87 undergraduates and eight expert
judges (professors and graduate students who conduct research on sex differences in
jealousy) who did not participate in the study. Words rated as indicating either emotional
or sexual infidelity by >80% of raters were used as stimuli in the IAT. Participants were
presented with one word on the screen at a time. In the first block of trials, participants
categorized words as either pleasant or unpleasant. In the second block, they categorized
words associated with either sexual infidelity or emotional infidelity. A definition of each
infidelity type was provided. In the third block of trials, participants were randomly shown
the positive, negative, and infidelity-related words and asked to categorize each as either
"pleasant" or "unpleasant" and "emotional infidelity" or "sexual infidelity" in a
counterbalanced design. Reaction time was measured by how long it took them to enter the
"correct" answer and answers were considered "errors" when they were not categorized
properly. An example of an error would be categorizing the word "cheating" in the
pleasant/emotional infidelity category.
Results
Results for the IAT supported the prediction that men would show greater bias to
words depicting sexual jealousy, but did not support the prediction that women would show
greater bias to words depicting emotional infidelity. There were no differences in reaction
time between men and women, but we did find an effect for number of errors committed.
Men made significantly more errors than women when asked to classify sexual infidelity
words with the positive/pleasant category (M women = 4.63, men = 7.19; F (1, 66) = 5.19,
p <.05; see Figure 1). The other conditions although not statistically significant showed
trends in support of our predictions for sex differences. (see Table 1 for full results).
Although the results did not fully support the predictions (i.e., there was no overall
reaction time effect or an error effect for emotional infidelity in women), there was
evidence that men have greater difficulty than women when asked to categorize a word
suggestive of sexual infidelity as being positive. Reference to sexual infidelity may produce
greater interference in the cognitive abilities of men than emotional infidelity does for
women, a finding that is also evident in Experiment 2.

Experiment 2: Stroop Test Primed with Infidelity Scenarios
Participants
Sixty-eight undergraduates (33 men; 35 women M age = 21.7) from a Northeastern
United States university volunteered for participation. All participants gave written
informed consent and received course extra credit for their participation.
Apparatus and Procedures
Stimuli were presented to participants on a Gateway desktop computer with a 15"
monitor. Participants were seated 35-40 cm away from the screen. The experiment was run
in SuperLab® 2.0 and a Radio Shack desktop computer microphone (model #33-3031) was
used to record responses. The cognitive mechanism theoretically associated with this task is
inhibition; i.e., participants must inhibit their initial response (e.g., what the word says) and
report something different (e.g., color of word). Modified emotional Stroop tests are
designed to investigate emotional words instead of the color words in the initial test (e.g.,
seeing the word "red" in green ink). The modified tests are typically designed to investigate
neutral vs. anxiety provoking terms. Research has shown that individuals with
psychological disorders show a longer reaction time (RT) during an emotional Stroop test
when those words are related to their clinical concerns (e.g., Thomas, Johnstone, and
Gonsalvez, 2006). The slower reaction time has been attributed to attentional bias, but this
interpretation has been disputed and has been argued to "demonstrate interference from
personally relevant stimuli, rather than a clean attentional bias" (see Teachman, Smith-
Janik, and Saporito, in press).
In the Stroop task, participants responded to the word on the screen by saying the
color of the word into the microphone. The Stroop task began with a practice round
consisting of color naming (each item consists of five O's, with each of the series printed in
one of five colors [red, orange, green, brown, and blue]). In the second part of the practice
round, participants are asked to say the color of the word shown on the screen. Each item
was one of five colored words with no words being presented in their own color (e.g.,
seeing the word red in the color blue). There were three priming conditions: a control
condition, an emotional infidelity condition, and a sexual infidelity condition. After
priming participants were randomly shown both neutral words and infidelity-related words
in each condition. Similar to Intilli and Tarrier (1998), the categorized words included
McKenna emotional words (a strong emotional connotation, e.g., crash, fail, fear, death,
and grief), McKenna control words (neutral words matched to the previous set on word
length; e.g., clock, gate, note, thumb, field), infidelity target words (e.g., suspicious, rival,
unfaithful, cheating, false) and control words (words matched for word length and
frequency of usage to the infidelity target words; e.g., needlework, flask, helicopter,
metaphor, stair).
In the emotional infidelity condition, participants were asked to think about and
visualize their partner spending time with someone else or having an interest in someone
else without having a sexual relationship with that person. In the sexual infidelity condition,
participants were asked to imagine their partner having a one-night stand or sexual "fling"
with someone else but not having any feelings for this individual. In the control condition,
participants were not asked to imagine any type of scenario. The control condition was

Jealousy-based cognition
always run first followed by the sexual and emotional infidelity priming conditions using a
counterbalanced design. We were not able to record vocal response errors--e.g., saying
"blue" when the word was green. SuperLab® 2.0 only has the capability to record reaction
time in this type of task.

Sexual Infidelity 865.73 (215.83) 832.32 (174.04)
Results
Reaction times less than 300 ms and greater than 3500 ms were excluded from
analysis (similar to Yovel and Mineka, 2004). These outlier reaction times would typically
occur because the microphone may not have picked up their initial response.
The results of the Stroop task were consistent with our predictions. We found a
main effect for the priming conditions, F (2, 132) = 4.29, p < .05. A significant interaction
was also found between priming and sex, F (2,132) = 6.14, p < .01, indicating that men's
reaction time was longer when primed with sexual infidelity (see Table 2). This suggests
that the priming conditions did impact the reaction time of participants and that a
significant sex difference exists. There were four categorizations used within each of the
priming conditions. Following, we present key results for each of the four categorizations
across conditions.
In the Infidelity Control category, there was no overall main effect, F (2, 132) =
2.31, p > .05, and no interaction between the Infidelity control words and sex, F (2,132) =
0.99, p > .05. In the Infidelity Target category, there was no main effect, F (2, 132) = 0.38,
p >.05, but there was a significant interaction between the infidelity target words and sex, F
(2, 132) = 6.35, p < .01, indicating that men's reaction time increased when primed with
sexual infidelity (See Figures 2a and 2b). In the McKenna Control category, there was an
overall main effect, F (2, 132) = 3.22, p < .05 and a significant interaction between
McKenna control words and sex, F (2, 132) = 4.68, p < .05. In the McKenna Target
category, there was a significant main effect, F (2, 132) = 4.77, p = .01, and a significant
interaction between the McKenna target category and sex, F (2, 132) = 5.83, p < .01 (see
Figures 3a and 3b).

A within-participants ANOVA generated a main effect for the Infidelity and

when this test was conducted on the target words: a main effect was not observed for the

interaction between the target words and sex, F (2, 132) = 7.35, p < .01 (see Table 3 for

Discussion
The current results, for men, are consistent with the evolutionary hypothesis of sex
differences in reaction to a partner's infidelity. These results support the hypothesis for a
male bias to processing information about sexual infidelity implicitly, which further
supports the hypothesis of an evolved cognitive adaptation for the detection and correction
of infidelity (Shackelford, 2003). When men are performing implicit cognitive tasks while
asked to think about sexual infidelity, the interference caused by these thoughts slows
performance and produces more errors. The male mind may be more likely to attend to
sexual infidelity because this would have been an adaptive mate guarding strategy. There
may be a tradeoff between processing cognitive tasks and mate guarding, and for men's
fitness; i.e., solving the adaptive problem of maintaining their partner's fidelity might
override other types of cognitive processing, and consequently hijack attentional resources
being utilized to process other types of information in their environment.

Jealousy-based cognition
We did not find support for the prediction that women would have a slower reaction
time and commit more errors when primed with an emotional infidelity scenario. These
data are in contrast to recent evidence indicating that women are more attuned to
information about emotional infidelity (Buss et al., 1992; Buss and Shackelford, 1997;
Buss et al 1999; Pietrzak et al., 2002; Sagarin et al., 2003; Schützwohl 2004; Schützwohl
and Koch, 2004; Shackelford et al., 2000). For women, emotional infidelity might not
impact cognitive systems involved in attention to the same degree that sexual infidelity
does for men. This finding is consistent with the nature of sexual infidelity and emotional
infidelity: the detection of sexual infidelity can occur in one instance; that is the discovery
of a partner's sexual infidelity can happen quickly and once it is known or certain it is
clear. However, emotional infidelity often takes time to develop, thus the discovery of
emotional infidelity may trigger cognitive processes involved with episodic memory (e.g.,
remembering episodes when a partner has expressed emotional attachment to another)
rather than attention.
This research has several limitations. The samples were limited to university
students. Replication of this study using a sample with more experience in romantic
relationships would help to establish the generalizability of the results. Individuals who are
older than those in the current young adult college samples may be more likely to have had
serious long-term relationships and more relationships in which they experienced a
partner's infidelity. One of the limitations experienced with the Stroop task was that the
software we used was unable to record errors (e.g., saying "blue" when the word was
green). Although the reaction time information did provide some of the information we
sought, the number and type of errors across conditions might have provided more
evidence and better comparison to the Implicit Association Test. Future research should
continue to investigate what types of cognitive processing (e.g., attention, memory) is
impacted by strategies selected to detect a partner's infidelity.
Although both sexes are upset by a partner's infidelities, the current research
suggests that men's cognitive skills may be especially impacted by processing information
related to a partner's sexual infidelity. This research adds to a growing literature on the
emotion of jealousy and on the sex differences in experienced jealousy. A better
understanding on the cognitive effects of experiencing jealousy might result in improving
the care provided to individuals who experience extreme levels of jealousy and may lead to
better identifying potentially dangerous behaviors which result from extreme jealous
behavior.
