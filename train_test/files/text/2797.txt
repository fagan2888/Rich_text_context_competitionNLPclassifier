The SCIRehab project provides an important contribution to the field of spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation
research by implementing the Practice Based Evidence (PBE) research methodology, which complements more tra-
ditional approaches such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In contrast to RCTs, which elegantly assess the
causal efficacy of a specific treatment in a specific population, PBE examines associations among many treatments
and outcomes. It is an observational approach that does not disrupt the treatment setting and assesses the full range
of treatments used across all patients. PBE seems a good match for the rehabilitation paradigm of multiple rehabi-
litation practitioners providing many individualized inputs concurrently. SCIRehab advances earlier studies that
introduced the PBE methodology to rehabilitation research: the Post-Stroke Rehabilitation Project (PSROP)1 and
the Joint Replacement Outcomes in Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities and Nursing Treatment sites (JOINTS).2
The methodology also is being applied in an ongoing study of traumatic brain injury rehabilitation.
Since the unique focus of PBE is on the complexity of the treatment process, the database developed in the
SCIRehab project is perhaps one of the most comprehensive of any observational research study. Its use of specialized
software on electronic handheld personal digital assistants (PDAs) to capture detailed data at the point of care for
each patient interaction by each clinician involved in the patient's treatment provides a wealth of information that
may be explored in attempts to identify associations between the many facets of rehabilitation care and better
post-rehabilitation outcomes. In addition to details of clinical interaction, extensive patient and treatment data
were abstracted from medical records and a broad array of outcomes were collected through follow-up interviews
at six- and twelve-months post injury.
This PBE approach is critically dependent on the participation of clinicians who take part in the care process to
provide detailed and timely data. It appears that, with the documentation of over 500,000 treatment interventions
by over 1000 clinicians, the methodology has succeeded in engaging the participation of clinicians. Lead clinicians
from each discipline at each of the six study centers fully participate in design, analysis, and dissemination efforts
as evidenced by authorship in the initial Journal of Spinal Cord Medicine series of SCIRehab articles (June 2009)
that presents the rehabilitation taxonomy as well as this current series that describes details of the treatment
process and variation in interventions associated with patient characteristics. The final proposed series will associate
treatment characteristics with outcomes at discharge and one-year post injury, after controlling for patient and injury
characteristics.
Limitations of the PBE approach however, must be recognized as the SCIRehab study moves forward examining the
relationship of treatments to outcomes. It must be emphasized that associations found may be important and may lead
to changes in practice; however, they do not allow for drawing causal conclusions. In fact, PBE has been criticized for
implying causal relationships3 and committing type I errors because sample sizes were not sufficient to split the sample
into two random subgroups so that initial analytic models could be developed on one sample and replicated on a second
subsample from the same study.4 To address these concerns analytic plans for the SCIRehab study include splitting the
full dataset of 1,377 patients into two subsamples, analyzing one and validating findings on the other.

The next phase of the SCIRehab project will demonstrate the utility of the PBE approach, highlight its weaknesses,
or most likely, some of both. The potential strength of PBE lies in its ability to identify many promising relationships
in one large study when the current field of SCI rehabilitation has little evidence base. SCIRehab certainly provides a
database containing many details of the rehabilitation process, and next, the project will explore whether the combi-
nation of the detailed process data and patient characteristics produce meaningful insights into what interventions
and treatment approaches are associated most strongly with positive outcomes for particular groups of patients.
The series of SCIRehab papers in this issue clearly documents wide variation in the type and amount of treatment
provided to patients with SCI that is not explained by patient and injury characteristics alone; this leaves plenty of
treatment variation to be associated with outcomes in the next project phase. However, a risk is that functional out-
comes at the time of rehabilitation discharge will be explained largely by the level and completeness of injury, leaving
little remaining variance to be explained by patient or treatment characteristics. On the other hand, more distal out-
comes such as societal participation and satisfaction with life may be influenced by a myriad of factors and the influ-
ence of treatment variables may be relatively small or not yet fully realized at only 12-months post injury. But despite
these cautions, the third series of SCIRehab papers (to be published in this journal) will examine relationships
between treatments and outcomes to identify those treatments associated with better outcomes after controlling
for patient differences. It also should provide considerable insight into the relative value that PBE methodology
brings to SCI rehabilitation research.
