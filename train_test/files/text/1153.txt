CLINICAL REVIEW
Abuse of Prescription and Over-the-Counter
Medications
James E. Lessenger, MD, and Steven D. Feinberg, MD, MPH
The nonmedical use of prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications implies that the user is us-
ing them for reasons other than those indicated in the prescribing literature or on the box label. The
abuse of these medications is a national issue.
Intentional drug abuse of prescribed and OTC medicines has climbed steadily. Data from the 2005
National Survey on Drug Use and Health demonstrated that 6.4 million (2.6%) people aged 12 or older
had used prescription drugs for nonmedical reasons during the past month. Of these, 4.7 million used
pain relievers, 1.8 million used tranquilizers, and 1.1 million used stimulants. The nonmedical use of
prescription drugs in the past month among young adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 5.4% in 2002 to
6.3% in 2005, primarily because of an increase in the abusive use of pain relievers.
Physicians need to watch for prescription and OTC medication abuse. Treatment strategies include
(1) inquiring about prescription, OTC, and herbal drug use at the initial examination (even though
many individuals are drug-abuse savvy, some are nai
¨ve and do not realize that OTC medications can be
problematic); (2) inquiring about drug use during office visits; (3) providing disposal containers that
patients can use to dispose of their unused or unneeded prescription or OTC medications; (4) treating
pain aggressively and appropriately; (5) practicing careful record keeping of prescription refills and
controls over prescription blanks; (6) referring patients who are addicted to medications to 12-step
programs such as Alcoholic Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and Pills Anonymous; and (7) consider-
ing detoxification. (J Am Board Fam Med 2008;21:45­54.)
The nonmedical use of a prescription or over-the-
counter (OTC) medication implies that the user is
using it for reasons other than those indicated in
the prescribing literature or on the box label.1 The
abuse of these medications is a national issue. Pre-
scription medications are those pharmaceuticals
dispensed by a pharmacist on the presentation of a
prescription written by a physician, dentist, or
other health care provider who is legally authorized
to write prescriptions. OTC medications are phar-
maceuticals that do not require a prescription and
are sold on the shelves of markets, stores, and
pharmacies.2
Scope of the Problem
Intentional drug abuse of prescribed and OTC
medicines has climbed steadily over the years. Data
from the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health demonstrated that 6.4 million (2.6%) peo-
ple aged 12 or older used prescription psychother-
apeutic drugs for nonmedical reasons during the
previous month. Of these, 4.7 million used pain
relievers, 1.8 million used tranquilizers, and 1.1
million used stimulants (including 512,000 using
methamphetamines). Nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion drugs in the previous month among young
adults aged 18 to 25 increased from 5.4% in 2002
to 6.3% in 2005. This was primarily because of an
increase in the use of pain relievers, which was
4.1% in 2002 and 4.7% in 2003, 2004, and 2005.3
In 2005, among people aged 12 or older who
used pain relievers for nonmedical reasons in the
previous 12 months, 59.8% reported that it was
obtained free from a friend or relative. Another
16.8% reported they obtained the drug from one or
more doctors. Only 4.3% purchased the pain re-
lievers from a drug dealer or other stranger, and

0.8% reported buying the drug on the Internet. In
2005 the specific illicit drugs that had the highest
levels of dependence or abuse in the previous year
were marijuana (4.1 million), cocaine (1.5 million),
and pain relievers (1.5 million). Nonmedical use of
pain relievers (2.2 million) and marijuana (2.1 mil-
lion) accounted for the largest number of first-time
abuse among people aged 12 or older.3
In a recent New Mexico study of deaths from
unintentional drug poisoning, 0.9% were from
OTC medications.4 A 2004 national survey dem-
onstrated that suicide-prone patients with a diag-
nosis of substance abuse who possess prescription
medications are more likely to overdose on OTC
medications.5
A study of Tulare County, California, Drug
Court clients found that 8.5% admitted to abusing
prescription drugs and 16.2% admitted to abusing
OTC medications, mostly ephedrine and other
stimulants. None of the clients admitted to pre-
scription drugs or OTC medications as their drug-
of-choice (DOC), although some admitted addic-
tion to Vicodin after the study was completed.6
This study suggests that some drug addicts may
only resort to prescriptive or OTC medications
when their illegal drugs are not available.
In emergency departments in the United States,
prescription and OTC drugs were the primary sub-
stances of abuse for 4% of the 1.9 million patients
admitted for drug treatment in 2002. Prescription
medications were primarily opioids, stimulants,
tranquilizers, and sedatives. OTC drugs included
aspirin, cough syrup, diphenhydramine and other
antihistamines, sleep aids, and other legally ob-
tained medications.7 In 2002, 55% of the total
drug-related emergency department admissions
were for prescription narcotics. Most of the people
seen in the emergency departments were white and
female and had never had a previous emergency
department visit because of illicit drugs. Compari-
son with 1992 data demonstrated an increase in
opiate and OTC use, with a relative decrease of
sedative and tranquilizer use. The use of stimulants
remained the same7,8 (Table 15).
Trends in Use
People use potentially addicting prescription or
OTC medications in the following manners:
 For legitimate, prescribed medical treatment; for
example, methamphetamines for narcolepsy and
opiates for severe trauma.
 As an additional drug to use when the DOC is
unavailable on the streets.
 As a booster for a more intense high.
 As an alternative addictive drug when their DOC
has been eliminated from use by drug testing.
 As an alternative addictive drug prescribed by
physicians; for example, amphetamines in diet
clinics. These prescriptions may be issued either
naively by the physician or for profit.9,10
Data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network
demonstrate the following about people who abuse
prescription or OTC medications:
 They tend to be white.
 They tend to be younger (when stimulants are
the DOC).
 They tend to use opiates.
 They tend to be women; women tend to use
tranquilizers and sedatives.
 They tend to mix their medications with alcohol.
 They tend to use prescription and OTC medica-
tions in conjunction with alcohol as a vehicle for
suicide.
 They obtain the prescription medications by pre-
scription from their physicians or dentists, as
gifts from friends, or purchase them on the black

market. OTC medications are, of course, pur-
chased at stores.7,8,11,12
Many of the medications in this paper have le-
gitimate medical uses for people with a variety of
illnesses and injuries. They may even be used in
high doses for selected medical problems. The
question arises as to whether the medication is
being prescribed by the physician and used by the
client appropriately or if it is being inappropriately
prescribed or used. This problem is most common
in the use of opioids and stimulants.13
When a legal medication is the addict's primary
DOC, it was either prescribed by a physician or
purchased on the streets. There are 3 people in-
volved in the abuse: (1) the physician, who either
knowingly or naively prescribes pharmaceuticals to
a person who is faking pain; (2) the person who
fakes or exaggerates an illness to obtain a prescrip-
tion, which is then filled in a pharmacy and may be
sold at locations where he or she can obtain high
prices; and (3) the addict who purchases the med-
ications for his own use.10,13
Physicians who prescribe or dispense medica-
tions that can be abused are at risk for becoming
part of the problem. Some physicians are part of
the illegal network of drug sales, but others fall into
the trap of trying to help people as best they can.
Recent campaigns to treat pain as a vital sign along
with blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and
temperature make it necessary for professionals to
treat pain aggressively and appropriately. The Fed-
eral and state governments' campaign against the
illicit use of prescription opiates, on the other hand,
has made it difficult at times for patients to obtain
relief for the pain of cancer or a debilitating disease.
Under-treatment of pain has also become a prob-
lem among prescribing physicians, resulting from
fears of investigation by regulatory agencies. Phy-
sicians have found themselves fearful of govern-
ment sanctions if they prescribe these medications.
Paradoxically, some patients refuse to take opiates
and other medications for pain control at the end of
their lives for fear of becoming addicted.13,14
Professionals who prescribe or work around
controlled drugs also are at risk of abusing readily
available medications and becoming addicted. Part
of the problem is that not only do the professionals
divert medications for their own use, but, in some
cases, they rob patients of necessary medications.9
Dependence on Medication and Pseudo-addiction
There are clear differences between the physical
dependence on medication, active addiction, addic-
tion in remission, and pseudo-addiction. The de-
pendence on medication may be therapeutic re-
gardless of the class to which it belongs. Physical
dependence of a therapeutic drug may occur, re-
sulting in withdrawal symptoms if the medication is
suddenly stopped. This is a physiologic response to
the chronic use of a medication, just as stopping a
blood pressure medicine suddenly can cause hyper-
tension, heart attack, or stroke. Drug-seeking be-
havior, actions to obtain drugs either by a prescrip-
tion or otherwise, may in some people reflect not
addiction but rather difficulty in obtaining appro-
priate medications because they are labeled as ad-
dicts. Some people with a history of addiction to
illicit drugs may also have a chronic pain syndrome
that would benefit from appropriate opiate pain
medication. A person recovering from drug addic-
tion may need a stimulant for narcolepsy or a tran-
quilizer for anxiety. If these problems are under-
treated because of physician fear, a syndrome of
pseudo-addiction may occur, in which the person
engages in drug-seeking behavior simply to obtain
a therapeutic and effective dosage level of a medi-
cation.14
Patients in drug-addiction recovery may be even
more vigilant than the physician. They are acutely
aware of the consequences of relapse and do not
want to experience the problems of addiction again.
For that reason, some people in recovery may forgo
opioid medications even in the face of severe trauma.14
Disposal of Prescription and OTC Medications
A recurring problem facing patients in drug addic-
tion recovery is the disposal of prescription and
OTC medications they have on hand. Especially
early in their program, patients may have hundreds
of prescription and OTC tablets as well as herbal
preparations and supplements. They may be using
these as part of their abuse pattern or keeping them
in case their addictive cravings overwhelm them.15
Disposal of these remedies becomes problematic
because the patients cannot throw them in the
trash, which could be searched by law enforcement
authorities. A similar situation exists if they try to
give it to friends. In many states, pharmacies cannot
legally take back the medications and other phar-
macies may refuse because of liability concerns. In
addition, there are many environmental concerns
doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2008.01.070071 Abuse of Prescription and OTC Medications 47
about the disposal of medications and contami-
nated syringes. A possible solution might be to
provide locked, hazardous waste collection contain-
ers at the physician's offices where a patient can
dispose of used syringes and medications.6
Although this article focuses on abuse, there are
other nonmedical uses of prescription medications.
These include bartering, especially in jails and pris-
ons; use as a mechanism of suicide; use as a mech-
anism of homicide; and accidental ingestion.16
Abused Prescription Drugs
Commonly abused prescription drugs are summa-
rized in Table 2. Detection of these pharmaceuti-
cals is difficult because the Federal Department of
Transportation drug test panel, or a standard fo-
rensic drug test panel, may not pick up some of
these substances, including oxycodone. Detoxifica-
tion and withdrawal from any of the medications
may be problematic and may require inpatient
treatment and appropriate pharmacological sup-
port (Table 2).17
The Internet is a major source of prescription
drugs that are used for nonmedical uses. A 2006
survey documented that 89% of sites selling con-
trolled prescription drugs have no prescription re-
quirements, a figure that is down from 94% in
2004. Of the 11% of sites that required a prescrip-
tion, 70% only required a prescription be faxed,
allowing a customer to easily forge prescriptions or
fax the same prescription to several Internet phar-
macies. There has also been a trend toward online
consultation in lieu of a prescription. In 2006, 99
Web sites offered such a service.18
Sedatives
Barbiturates are typically used as a sedative and
anticonvulsant, but they have an equal role as the
means to decrease the likelihood of seizures and
other symptoms in alcohol, heroin, and other types
of drug withdrawal. This class of medications is
easily abused as a hypnotic and overdose is com-
mon, resulting in death through respiratory depres-
sion. They are addictive but tolerance can occur; a
withdrawal syndrome exists, consisting of agitation,
headaches, psychomotor retardation, confusion,
and possible seizures. Addicts may seek out barbi-
turates as a sleep aid and as a method of self-
detoxification if they know that a Department of
Transportation drug test is nearing.19
Opioids and Morphine Derivatives
Considerable controversy exists about the use of
opioids for the treatment of chronic pain not orig-
inating from cancer and the resulting increase in
medications available for diversion to illicit use.
Under-treatment of pain has also become a prob-
lem among physicians because of fears of investi-
gation by regulatory agencies. One response to
under-treatment has been the appearance of drug-
seeking behavior among people with legitimate
non-cancer pain.20 Myriad state and Federal laws
and polices provide physicians with a confusing
picture of when and to whom these medications
can be prescribed.
A recent survey of physicians regarding drug
abuse showed that doctors perceive the 4 mecha-
nisms of diversion to be (1) doctor shopping to find
a cooperative professional; (2) obtaining controlled
substances from multiple doctors; (3) patient de-
ception or manipulation of doctors; and (4) forged
or altered prescriptions.16 A fifth source, not well
studied, consists of doctors and dentists who pre-
scribe controlled drugs for money or who divert
them for their own use. Reports from England
document that most opioids that are used by ad-
dicts for nonmedical indications are prescribed by a
small number of physicians.21

Stimulants
Of particular concern are stimulant medications
used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disor-
der. In 2004, there were 7873 emergency depart-
ment visits by people who were found to be suffer-
ing from poisoning because of the nonmedical use
of amphetamine-dextroamphetamine or methyl-
phenidate. Of visits to the emergency department
for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder medica-
tion problems, 48% were for nonmedical use of the
medications, 34% were adverse reactions associated
with medical use, 10% were accidental ingestion,
and 8% were suicide attempts. The rates were
higher for the 12- to 17-year-old age group than
for patients aged 18 or older. Over two thirds
(68%) of the visits involved nonmedical use of these
2 drugs and another substance, such as alcohol, an
illicit drug, or a pharmaceutical.8
Tranquilizers and Muscle Relaxers
Benzodiazepines are commonly diverted for non-
medical uses. They are typically prescribed as sleep
aids or as anti-anxiety medications. They are also
useful in detoxification from alcohol or other sub-
stances and are useful in the treatment of convul-
sive disorders. Overdose can cause respiratory de-
pression, especially when used with other sedative
medications or alcohol.22
There is a syndrome of paradoxical disinhibition
that results in increased excitement, irritability, ag-
gression, hostility, and impulsivity. In rare cases,
these conditions can lead to attacks of rage or
violence or other antisocial behaviors. Tolerance
can develop with the use of these medications.22
High benzodiazepine doses are used by addicts to
enhance the euphoria effects of opioids; boost
methadone or heroin fixes; temper cocaine highs;
augment the effects of alcohol; or ease the effects of
withdrawal from heroin, methadone, and other
drugs.22
Muscle relaxants can also be addicting. Cariso-
prodol, a centrally acting muscle relaxant sold un-
der the name of Soma, is an example. Its active
metabolite is meprobamate, a class IV substance
and a highly addictive and potent sedative-hyp-
notic. Ingestion can cause addiction and a mild
sense of euphoria. Higher doses cause euphoria and
impaired hand-eye coordination and balance. Tol-
erance exists and there is a withdrawal syndrome of
anxiety, tremor, muscle twitching, insomnia, auditory
and visual hallucinations, and bizarre behavior.23
Pharmaceuticals for Erectile Dysfunction
Sildenafil (Viagra; Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY) has
become the sentinel erectile dysfunction medica-
tion in the drug-using culture; an underground
network of faked prescriptions, foreign imports,
and Internet purchases exists. Both homosexual and
heterosexual men and women are documented to
have demonstrated drug-seeking behavior with this
substance.24 In a survey of sexually active males
aged 18 to 25 years, 13% reported erectile dysfunc-
tion and 6% used medications, but rarely under
medical supervision and often mixed with recre-
ational drugs.25 Among British illicit drug users,
Sildenafil use among night clubbers, a sentinel pop-
ulation of illicit drug users, was first reported in
1999. Use by both men and women was reported,
with elevated prevalence levels among both gay
men and women.26
Among gay men and women, Sildenafil along
with cocaine, crystal methamphetamines, amyl ni-
trate poppers, Ecstasy, gamma-hydroxybuterate,
and ketamine has become a "club drug."27 Meth-
amphetamine and Sildenafil use are linked to un-
protected receptive and insertive anal sex, respec-
tively, in a sample of gay men.28 Sildenafil use
appears to have become a stable fixture of the sexual
culture of gay men and is associated with a general
behavioral risk patter for transmission of HIV and
other sexually transmitted diseases.29 The concom-
itant use of Viagra, testosterone, and antidepres-
sants among HIV-seropositive gay and bisexual
men has been associated with unintended negative
effects because of the additive risk of side effects.30
Recent anecdotal evidence suggest that Sildena-
fil abuse is becoming increasingly popular among
Ecstasy users to attempt to negate the erectile dys-
function side-effects of the drug or to enhance the
drug experience through the concomitant use of
erectile dysfunction drugs.31
Abused OTC Drugs
OTC drugs are easily purchased, are difficult to
detect on routine drug testing, and can be used as
an alternative DOC when the addicted person's
primary drug had been removed.32 The literature is
sparse about OTC medications and herbal reme-
dies. Herbal remedies are especially problematic
because they can be sold at swap meets and other
unregulated venues; they are not subject to the
scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration;
doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2008.01.070071 Abuse of Prescription and OTC Medications 49
they may be imported from other countries, espe-
cially Mexico and China, that do not have strict
controls on their contents; they may include heavy
metals such as lead; the there are few systematic
studies of efficacy or safety.32 A representative list
of abused OTC drugs is found in Table 3. Partic-
ularly dangerous drugs or combinations of drugs
are discussed individually below (Table 3).
OTC Steroids in Exercise Gymnasiums
In a study of 511 men entering 5 exercise gymna-
siums it was found that 18% reported use of an-
drostededione or other anabolic steroids to increase
muscle mass; 25% used ephedrine as a stimulant.
Among the same group, 5% reported anabolic ste-
roid use within the last 3 years. Among women the
rates were 3%, 13%, and 0%, respectively.33
Dextromethorphan
Dextromethorphan hydrobromide (DXM, or
"robo"), a constituent of more than 125 OTC
cough and cold remedies, is the most popular
cough medication in the United States and is
widely used in other parts of the world. The most
common source of DXM is "extra-strength" cough
syrup, which contains 3 mg of the drug per 1 ml of
syrup. The recommended dose for treating coughs
is 1/6 to 1/3 ounce of medication containing 15 mg
to 30 mg of DXM. At higher doses it produces a
dissociative effect similar to phencyclidine and ket-
amine.34

Cough syrups or capsules also contain additional
ingredients such as acetaminophen, chlorpheni-
ramine maleate, guaifenesin, and pseudoephedrine.
Toxicity with overdose is additive to that of DXM
alone. An unknown number of adolescents in the
United States and Europe intoxicate themselves
with acute megadoses of dextromethorphan, de-
fined as 5 to 10 times the dose recommended for
control of annoying nonproductive coughs. Al-
though a moderate overdose of pure DXM hydro-
bromide is free of serious adverse effects, approxi-
mately 5% of people of European ethnicity lack the
ability to metabolize the drug normally, leading to
rapid, acute toxic levels. Variable quantities of pure
DXM powder in multiples of 1 g are available from
the Internet. Recipe-like extraction procedures are
available online, allowing for simple and inexpen-
sive home manufacture of concentrated DXM
powder from Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tab-
lets (Schering-Plough HealthCare Products, Inc.,
Kenilworth, NJ) (street name "triple C"). Acute
megadoses of the drug have profound psychologi-
cal and physiologic effects similar to those of phen-
cyclidine. Megadoses of DXM used to self-intoxi-
cate can produce a false-positive screening test for
phencyclidine in a urine specimen.35
DXM can cause psychosis, dependence, and
physical withdrawal. It has specific serotonergic
and sigma-1 opioidergic properties. Dextrorphan,
the active metabolite of DXM, has similar proper-
ties; however, it is a weaker sigma opioid receptor
agonist and a stronger N-methyl-D-aspartic acid
receptor antagonist. DXM and its metabolite, dex-
trorphan, display specific biological features of ad-
diction, including tolerance, and are capable of in-
ducing specific psychiatric sequelae. There are
more profound and potentially life-threatening ef-
fects at even higher doses. Dextrorphan has phar-
macodynamic properties and its intoxication effects
produce dissociation, a state that abusers seek.
Withdrawal is manifested by a profound depres-
sion.36 Chronic addiction has been described in the
literature.37
Coricidin Intoxication
Coricidin HBP is a popular OTC antihistamine
and decongestant that is safe and effective when
used as directed on the product label. It is also sold
as Coricidin D, Coricidin D (long acting), and
Coricidin D (cold, flu, and sinus). These medica-
tions contain a combination of dextromethorphan
hydrobromide, chlorpheniramine maleate, phenyl-
propanolamine hydrochloride, and acetaminophen.
The Texas Poison Network reported 78 cases of
Coricidin intoxication from 1998 to 1999. Of these
78 cases, 63% of the patients were men and 38%
were women. The mean age was 14.67 years, with
77% being between 13 and 17 years old. Eighteen
different symptoms were reported: tachycardia
(50%); somnolence (24.4%); mydriasis and hyper-
tension (16.7%); agitation (12.8%); disorientation
(10.3%); slurred speech (9%); ataxia (6.4%); vom-
iting (5.1%); dry mouth and hallucinations (3.9%);
tremor (2.6%); and headache, dizziness, syncope,
seizure, chest pain, and nystagmus (1.3% each).38
Rapture
A 20-year-old man developed a brief psychotic ep-
isode associated with per secutory delusional beliefs
and auditory and visual hallucinations, leading him
to commit arson. The episodes occurred 12 hours
after he took large doses of an OTC dietary sup-
plement containing piperazine, a stimulant known
on the streets as "rapture." The patient also used
small doses of cannabis and nitrous oxide and had
no prior psychiatric history. He reportedly com-
pletely recovered.39
Dimenhydrinate
The OTC anti-emetic dimenhydrinate (Gravol or
Dramamine) is a compound of diphenhydramine
and 8-chlorotheophylline. Drug users abuse it for
the acute effects of euphoric sensations and hallu-
cinations, whereas psychiatric patients abuse it be-
cause of its anti-anxiety effects.40 Patients suffering
from schizophrenia may be at risk because of its
anticholinergic effects. One report suggests that
clozapine reduces cravings for dimenhydrinate.40
Dimenhydrinate is an H1 histamine receptor
antagonist but it interacts either directly or indi-
rectly with other neurotransmitter systems, includ-
ing acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopa-
mine, opioids, or adenosine. Animal behavioral
studies looking at self-administration, conditioned
for place preference, drug discrimination, and
modulation of operant responding, show that anti-
histamines have abuse potential. Further support
comes from reports of acute and chronic abuse of
dimenhydrinate by humans.40
doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2008.01.070071 Abuse of Prescription and OTC Medications 51
Diphenhydramine
The antihistaminic drug diphenhydramine is
mainly used as a sedative, hypnotic, and antiemetic.
In many countries it is available OTC under the
name Benadryl. It is very common and generally
regarded as a harmless drug. The recreational goal
and the intoxication syndrome affect 2 separate
populations differently. People with a nonaddictive
genetic constitution use it as a long-term hypnotic
to aid with sleeping. Those with a genetic predis-
position to addiction use it for the subjective high
of a stimulant.41
The intoxication symptoms are also inconsis-
tent. Some people present with somnolence, se-
dation, and retardation. In people with a genetic
predisposition to addiction, there are tachycar-
dia, anticholinergic syndrome, agitation, halluci-
nations, confusion, tremor, convulsions, delir-
ium, and coma. A toxic psychosis is possible.
Diphenhydramine can be used orally or intrave-
nously. Medical personnel are at risk for addic-
tion because diphenhydramine is commonly on
stock in hospitals and clinics to treat allergic
reactions. Tolerance does exist with this OTC
medication, and withdrawal results in sedation
and memory impairment.42,43
Hydroxycut
Because herbal products are not subject to the same
rigorous Food and Drug Administration regula-
tions that are required for prescription and OTC
products, consumers unknowingly risk adverse ef-
fects when taking these products. A 22-year-old
man was hospitalized after unexplained seizure-like
activity and unresponsiveness. A urine toxicology
screen was negative for salicylates, acetaminophen,
alcohol, and drugs-of-abuse. Medical history was
insignificant with the exception of recent (within 2
weeks) ingestion of Hydroxycut, a dietary supple-
ment purported to enhance energy, build muscle,
and burn fat. The agent contains ephedra alkaloids
and caffeine, both of which are central nervous
system stimulants. The seizure was attributed to
their consumption. Because of a significant number
of reported adverse events, the Food and Drug
Administration proposed regulations for dietary
supplements containing ephedra alkaloids and re-
quested an independent review of case reports
linked to these products.44
Cyclizine
Abuse of cyclizine hydrochloride, a nonprescrip-
tion medication, was noted to occur frequently in
Utah. Cyclizine is an OTC antihistamine. A retro-
spective review of the Utah Poison Control Center
records of patients younger than 18 years of age
who intentionally ingested cyclizine and demon-
strated abuse accounted for 89% of cyclizine toxic
ingestions. Hallucinations (70%) and confusion
and disorientation (40%) were the most notable
symptoms. Tachycardia (52%) and systolic hyper-
tension (69%) were frequently present in patients
who presented to a hospital. No serious complica-
tions occurred. The researchers concluded that
abuse of OTC medications by adolescents may be
more appealing than illicit drug use for numerous
reasons, and may be more common than appreci-
ated.46
OTC Analgesics
Using high levels of OTC analgesics, including
aspirin and acetaminophen, over long periods of
time have been associated with dysphoric mood
states. Phenacetin, which was taken off the market
in the 1970s, had intoxicating effects and produced
a dissociative state.34
Intravenous Epinephrine
A case that demonstrates the lengths that people
will take to convert OTC medications to drugs of
abuse concerns a 19-year-old man who intrave-
nously injected 1.1 mg of epinephrine (adrenalin)
that was removed from an OTC bronchodilator
inhaler usually used for asthma. The man had a
history of intravenous cocaine and amphetamine
abuse. Within seconds, he developed headache,
nausea, numbness of the hands and feet, chest pain,
and palpitations. The electrocardiograph demon-
strated ischemic changes.46
OTC Hypnotics (Sleep Aids)
Used in excess amounts, OTC sleep aids (Sominex,
Nytol, and Sleep Eze) can cause hallucinations,
delirium, and confusion. When use is stopped, re-
covery is rapid and there is no withdrawal syn-
drome.41
Strategies for Physicians
Physicians must be on the alert for prescription and
OTC medication abuse. Strategies that can be em-
52 JABFM January­February 2008 Vol. 21 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.org
ployed include (1) inquiring about prescription,
OTC, and herbal drug use at the initial examina-
tion (although many individuals are drug-abuse
savvy, some are nai
¨ve and don't realize that OTC
medications can be problematic); (2) inquiring
about illegal drug use during office visits; (3) pro-
viding disposal containers that patients can use to
dispose of their unused or unneeded prescription or
OTC medications; (4) treating pain aggressively
and appropriately; (5) practicing careful record
keeping of prescription refills and controls over
prescription blanks; (6) referring patients who are
addicted to medications to 12-step programs such
as Alcoholic Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous,
and Pills Anonymous; and (7) considering detoxifi-
cation, either inpatient or outpatient.
