Abstract
Background: health status is increasingly used as a measure of healthcare effectiveness. How diseases and symptoms
are associated with health status is not completely understood.
Objectives: to ®nd diseases, symptoms and demographic factors associated with physical and mental health status
in older Americans.
Methods: we analysed data from a survey of over 100 000 Medicare bene®ciaries aged 65 and older. We used the
short-form 36 physical and mental summary scores as measures of health status. Other data collected included
demographic details, symptoms and diagnoses.
Results: age as a single variable explained 4% of variation in physical health status. Adding other demographic
information and increased disease burden explained variation to 8% and 27% respectively. Together, shortness of
breath, back pain, dif®culty getting in and out of chairs, arthritis of hip or knee, a recent change in health and age
explained 54% of variation. All available variables explained 59%. The role of age as an independent factor decreased
markedly after disease and symptoms were considered. Similar factors were associated with lower mental health status,
but age was not.
Conclusion: these data suggest that heart and lung disease and back pain are the most important factors affecting the
average physical health status of older people. Sex, marital status and race have very little independent effect. Efforts
to improve average physical health status scores might best be targeted at these conditions rather than demographic
characteristics. Mental health status does not decline with age, and similar factors affect it but to a lesser degree.

Introduction
Health status measures are used to evaluate the
outcomes of disease treatments, and to evaluate the
effects of socio-economic status and other variables
on health [1]. Recently, the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services (CMS) began collecting health status
data in order to monitor healthcare outcomes over time
in different Medicare settings. Healthcare providers,
managers and payers are interested in factors that affect
population health status [2].
A ®rst step in understanding what affects the health
status of the older population is to examine character-
istics associated with their health status. Analysis of
baseline data from the HCFA Health Outcomes Survey
provides an opportunity to examine these associations
in a very large population of older people.
Methodology
CMS's Health Outcomes Survey collects information
from Medicare bene®ciaries enrolled in managed care
plans. CMS randomly selects 1000 people enrolled from
each of )250 plans. Independent contract vendors
execute the survey and collect data. The ®rst question-
naires were mailed in 1998. Here, we present data from
that baseline survey.
The survey's health status measure is the short-form
36 (SF-36), a widely used generic health status question-
naire that has been found to be valid for older people [3].
The SF-36 asks questions such as: ``Does your health
limit you in (speci®c activities)?'', ``How much bodily
pain have you had during the past 4 weeks?'' and ``As
a result of your physical health, have you accomplished
less than you would like?'' There are also questions about
Age and Ageing 2001; 30: 495±501 # 2001, British Geriatrics Society
495
mood and mental state such as: ``How much of the time
during the past 4 weeks have you felt downhearted
and blue?''.
Answers to these questions are used to compute
two summary scores: the physical component summary
(PCS) score, used as a measure of general physical health
status, and the mental component summary (MCS), used
as a measure of general mental health status [4]. Lower
scores imply lower physical or mental health status.
Additional Health Outcomes Survey questions ask
about characteristics that have been shown to affect or
are hypothesized to affect health status. The questions
were suggested by an expert panel, based on the experts'
review of literature and personal experiences. The
questions ask about co-morbidity, such as symptoms
or diagnosis of heart problems, neurological conditions,
arthritis and cancer. For example, there are questions
about chest pain with exertion, shortness of breath
``when lying down ¯at'', and ``numbness or loss of
feeling in your feet''. These questions generally provide
a scale of possible responses, from `all of the time' to
`none of the time'. Diagnosis questions ask whether
``a doctor ever told you that you had . . . angina/a heart
attack/high blood pressure/cancer/stroke/emphysema/
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/
Crohn's disease or other in¯ammatory bowel disease/
any other condition''. These questions allow yes/no
responses. Other questions ask about conditions: for
example, urinary incontinence is indicated by a `yes'
response to the query: ``Do you have dif®culty control-
ling urination?''. Three questions ask about depression
and sadness.
Additional questions seek demographic informa-
tion (sex, age, education, marital status and household
income).
Response rate and response validity
Among 279 135 Medicare bene®ciaries sampled for the
survey, 258 705 were living at home and aged 65 or over,
according to insurance plan records. This was the target
group for our analysis. Among the target group, there
were 174 613 responsesÐa response rate of 67.5%.
Of these, 16 763 were from someone other than the
target individual, and 16 261 (9.3%) did not indicate
who completed the survey.
Because we had less con®dence in proxy responses
[5], we limited this analysis to individuals who had
answered the questions themselves. Thus, the sample
used for analysis here comprises the 141 589 community-
living individuals aged 065 who completed the ques-
tionnaire themselves. Of this group, 132 514 (93%)
had completed the questionnaires suf®ciently for us to
calculate SF-36 summary scores. Accuracy of coding
responses was evaluated by independent contractors
who coded a sample of 2397 survey response forms,
using double-coding procedures, and compared the
results with the original coding. This showed the original
coding of the data to be )99.5% accurate (personal
communication from S. C. Haffer, Centers for Medicare
& Medicaid Services, 1999).
Analyses
Approach and dependent variables
We focused on factors associated with physical and
mental health status as re¯ected by the two SF-36
summary scores. We expected multiple variables to affect
these summary scores, so we used stepwise multiple
regression as a convenient method for multivariate
analysis. The models used either the PCS or the MCS as
the dependent variable. Calculations were carried out
using SAS software, release 6±12 7 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA).
Independent variables
We used responses to the additional survey questions as
independent variables. We also used the health transition
question, which asks the respondent to rate his or her
health now compared to 1 year ago. This question is
included in the SF-36 form, but is not used for
calculating either the PCS or the MCS.
Analysis of MCS was identical to that of the PCS
except for the different dependent variables and, because
mood questions are part of the SF-36 questionnaire
and are used to compute the MCS, questions about
depression and sadness were not used as independent
variables.
Since some respondents did not answer all questions
and simple regression requires complete response sets,
regression analyses reported here represent responses
from 107 572 subjects.
Results
The average age was 73.7 years (range 65±108, SD=6.1),
57.9% were women, 58.4% were currently married and
74% were high-school graduates. Other demographic
data are listed in Table 1.
Responses to additional survey questions about
health are also shown in Table 1.
SF-36 component scores
PCS
The mean PCS was 42.6 (SD=11.4), representing a
mean physical health status below that of the general
population.
For interest, we analysed associations in several steps
(Table 2). In the ®rst model, we analysed the association

of PCS score with age alone. Only 4% of the variance in
PCS score was associated with age alone. Next we added
the demographic variables income, education, sex, race
and marital status. These additional variables increased
the explained variation to 8%. Next, to estimate the
effect of disease burden, we added to the model the total
number of medical conditions that the respondent
indicated he or she had: 27% percent of the variation
in PCS score was associated with these independent
variables. Then, instead of disease burden indicated by
number of conditions, we added the disease diagnoses
and symptoms. This produced a model R2 of 58%.
Finally, we added health transition responses: 59% of the
variation in PCSs was associated with these independent
variables (R2 =0.591). Being short of breath climbing
stairs was the most associated symptom (Table 3).
In a separate regression analysis, `shortness of breath
climbing one ¯ight of stairs' was most associated with
`shortness of breath walking -1 block' (R2 =0.64 in a
model in which total R2 =0.67; Pearson's correlation
=0.83). We grouped these two variables into a single
new variable, `short of breath with exercise'. We de®ned
this as `yes' if the response to either of the original
questions was `some of the time' or more often. We
analysed this dichotomous variable using logistic regres-
sion. The independent variable most associated with the
new variable `short of breath with exercise' was the
question ``Has a doctor ever told you that you had:
emphysema, or asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease?''Ðodds ratio (OR) 4.4, 95% con®dence
interval (CI) 4.2±4.6. Other important variables asso-
ciated with shortness of breath with exercise were
dif®culty getting in and out of chairs (OR 2.4; CI
2.3±2.5), heart failure (OR 2.1; CI 1.9±2.2) and angina
or coronary artery disease (OR 1.5; CI 1.4±1.6). In a
separate analysis, dif®culty getting in and out of chairs
was associated with both arthritis of the hip (OR 3.2;
CI 3.0±3.3) and back pain (OR 3.2; CI 3.1±3.4).
Other important variables associated with PCS were,
in order of importance: back pain, dif®culty getting in
and out of chairs, arthritis of the hip, and having a recent
health transition. The variables that are associated with
)1% of the variance (partial R2)0.01) are presented
in Table 3.

MCS
The mean MCS was 53.3 (SD=9.4), representing a mean
mental health status above that of the general popu-
lation. Only about 20% of the variation in MCS could
be explained by stepwise regression (R2 =0.208) in this
model. Age and sex were not signi®cantly associated
with the MCS. Most of the independent variables con-
tributed -1% to total R2(partial R2-0.01). As with the
PCS, having a recent negative health transition and back
pain were associated with MCS. However, a slightly
different group of other clinical problems was also
associated with )1% of its variance. These were short-
ness of breath when sitting or resting and chest pain or
pressure with exercise (Table 4).
The impact of the other chief variables on the mean
physical and mental health status is shown in Table 5.
Discussion
The physical and mental summary scores reported here
are scaled based on the general United States population
[6]. The scaling algorithm adjusts scores so that a score
of 50 is the same as the mean score of the adult US
population, and each 10-point difference represents one
standard deviation. This scaling assists interpretation of
scores. For example, if a `small clinically signi®cant
difference' is arbitrarily de®ned as 0.2 standard devi-
ations [7], this effect is re¯ected as a difference of two
points in the scaled SF-36 summary scores.
Physical health status declines with age. As expected,
at 42, the mean PCS for this older population was below
the norm for adults of all ages (50) [8]. However, age was
associated with only 4% of PCS variance when it was
used as the only explanatory variable in this population
of people aged 65 and over. Adding other variables to
the model reduced the importance of age. When the data
were adjusted for all other variables, the contribution of
age to total variance fell to 1% (R2 =0.010).
There was some fall-off in response rate among older
people. Response rates for ages 65±74, 75±84 and 85q
were 69%, 67% and 60% respectively. It is not known
what effect this relative under-representation of the
most-old produces. However, we analysed each age
category separately, and the top ®ve associations in each
category were the same. `Age' did not reach the level of
1% association in these limited age groups because there
was less age spreadÐi.e. respondents in each group are
nearly the same age. This suggests that for the popu-
lation we studied who responded, the major associ-
ations are consistent across age groups. We have no
way of knowing what the associations are among
non-respondents, who may be more frail or differ in
other ways.
Besides non-response bias, another potential source
of error is with self-reported diagnoses, even though the
question asks whether ``a doctor ever told you that you
had . . .''.
Disease burden, as measured by number of diagnoses
acknowledged by respondents, can be useful in explain-
ing or adjusting for health status, but it is not as effect-
ive at explaining variation as speci®c symptoms and
diagnoses.
The variable `shortness of breath climbing stairs' was
associated with the largest share of the variation in PCS
scores in multivariate analysis. Our further analysis of
this variable linked it to the presence of emphysema,
asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
dif®culty getting in and out of chairs and the presence
of heart disease. It is not clear why dif®culty getting in
and out of chairs is associated with shortness of breath
climbing stairs. It may be a re¯ection of general frailty, or
it may be that people with arthritis that causes dif®culty
getting in and out of chairs become deconditioned.
Back pain is the second most important single
variable associated with a lower PCS score. Other studies
have implicated back pain as having an important impact
on health status. For example, back pain, arthritis or
sciatica had the highest negative impact on bodily pain

and role limitation due to physical problemsÐtwo of
the subscales that determine the SF-36 PCSÐin a study
of 1200 Welsh residents [9]. In our analysis, the PCS
score among those who indicated they had back pain
that interfered with their usual daily activities `all the
time' was 25.8, re¯ecting a very low functional status.
The MCS for this group was 46.2, also well below the
average (Table 5). Overall frailty manifesting as dif®culty
getting in and out of chairs is also a major factor
associated with the PCS.
Mental health status does not appear to decline with
age. At 53, the mean MCS for this population was
slightly above the national adult norm for all ages.
The greatest association was found with shortness of
breath while sitting, back pain and chest pain on
exertion, although these variables contributed relatively
little to MCS. While the MCS was constructed to be
independent of physical components, these results
suggest that complete separation of physical and
mental components in SF-36 surveys is dif®cult to
achieve.
Perhaps the most intriguing ®nding in this analysis
is that demographic factorsÐsex, race, education and
household incomeÐhave little independent effect on
health status as measured by the SF-36. These data
suggest that healthcare planners and clinicians should
focus interventions on the disease processes that affect
functional status, rather than on the demographic char-
acteristics of the population served. Pulmonary and
heart disease and conditions that cause back pain would
seem to be appropriate targets, at least from a population
perspective. Individuals who have had a recent decline
in health also are among those with lower health status
scores. Urinary incontinence, dif®culty seeing or hearing,

Health status of older Americans
499
a diagnosis of diabetes and the other variables listed
in Table 1 are each associated with less than 1% of the
variation in SF-36 physical health status.
Finding associations between clinical conditions and
health outcomes does not prove that prevention or treat-
ment of the clinical conditions will improve health status,
but it seems likely that health status is at least in part
affected by healthcare. SF-36 scores have been respons-
ive to a number of treatment interventions, including
geriatric assessment [10], pulmonary surgery and rehab-
ilitation [11], total hip arthroplasty [12] and treatment
of sleep apnoea [13]. Shortness of breath climbing stairs
might be prevented or reduced by preventing or treating
heart failure, by improved individual physical condition-
ing and by treating arthritis. However, one study of
treatment of heart failure showed only little effect on
SF-36 scores [14]. Obesity has been associated with
shortness of breath and back pain and low SF-36 scores
[15], but few programmes have been successful in
reducing obesity. MCS in large populations may also
bene®t from improved treatment of cardiovascular
disease and back painÐalthough, to our knowledge,
this has not been tested.
Data such as these should encourage the use of
a systematic approach to improving care for older
people, which offers the potential for improved health
status [16].
CMS monitors the quality of Medicare-®nanced
healthcare, using a number of mechanisms that have
evolved over time [17]. Measuring health status using
the SF-36 provides an opportunity to monitor health-
care status in different settings. The SF-36 is a well-
validated instrument that re¯ects the concepts of
physical and mental health [18]. As healthcare quality
measurement evolves, the use of health status measures
such as the SF-36 will probably increase.
Over 5 million older Americans currently are in
healthcare plans that are required to use the SF-36 as
part of their healthcare quality monitoring by CMS [19].
CMS is exploring the possible use of the SF-36 to
estimate the health status of bene®ciaries in traditional
fee-for-service plans, which would expand its use to
over 98% of Americans aged 65 and over. Because of
the SF-36's widespread use as a health status measure,
it is important for clinicians and others who manage
healthcare to understand the clinical and demographic
factors associated with SF-36 scores.
Addendum
After submitting this manuscript, we had the opportun-
ity to complete similar analyses on 111 141 respondents
from 1999 survey data. The results were consistent with
those reported here, except age did not reach the level of
1% of variance in the physical component score. We feel
these additional analyses on a separate data set support
the above conclusions.
Key points
. Analyses of survey data from over 100 000 older
Americans provides information about associations
of health status with diseases, symptoms and
demographic details.
. While older people have lower physical health status,
adjusting for disease presence and speci®c symptoms
greatly reduces the association between age and health
status.
. Mental health status does not appear to decline
with age.
. Shortness of breath climbing one ¯ight of stairs is the
variable most associated with lower physical health
status. Back pain is the next most associated variable.
Diagnoses of pulmonary and heart disease, arthritis of
the hip or knee and a change in health in the past year
are also major factors associated with lower physical
health status.
. Sex, race, marital status and household income
explained -1% each of the physical health variation.
