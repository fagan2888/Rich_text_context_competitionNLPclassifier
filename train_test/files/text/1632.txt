Epidemiology
Obesity prevalence is disproportionately higher among
minority groups, with 45% of non-Hispanic blacks and 36%
of Mexican Americans categorized as obese (1). Race/ethnic
disparities in achieving goals of treatment in hypertension and
diabetes, potential consequences of obesity, are well recog-
nized (2,3). Studies have not examined whether there are race/
ethnic disparities in obesity treatment.
Despite increasing obesity prevalence, there are decreasing
trends in the number of patients who report receiving weight
loss advice from a health-care provider (4). Prior studies, how-
ever, did not have an ethnically diverse population and were
limited in assessing whether these trends were similar among
minority patients.
Using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data, we (i) examined trends in provider diagnosis
of overweight (defined as participant report of being told they
were overweight by a health-care professional), (ii) determined
if there were differences in provider diagnosis based on race/
ethnicity, and (iii) examined the association between provider
diagnosis and weight-related perceptions.
Methods And Procedures
Population
NHANES is a series of cross-sectional surveys that include a
nationally representative sample of the US noninstitutionalized civilian
population and over samples non-Hispanic black and Mexican-
American populations to provide stable estimates for these groups (5).
The current analyses are limited to adults (20 years) in survey years
1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004. Of these 15,332 individuals,
those with missing BMI data (n = 1,621), missing data in response to
the question of provider diagnosis of overweight (n = 2), those who

classified themselves as a race/ethnic group other than non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, or Mexican American (n = 283), or those
with BMI <30 (n = 9,319) were excluded, leaving 4,107 obese individuals
for the 
current analyses (1,289 in 1999­2000, 1,355 in 2001­2002, and
1,463 in 2003­2004).
Provider diagnosis
We defined "provider diagnosis" of overweight as an affirmative
response to the question: "Has a doctor or health professional ever
told you that you were overweight?" (5). This question was assessed by
interview during NHANES data collection.
Independent variables
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level, health insurance status, having
a routine health-care provider, and number of provider visits in the past
year were assessed by interview.
Height, weight, blood pressure, and fasting glucose were measured
using standardized protocols (5). BMI was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared and categorized as: obese
class I (BMI of 30­34.9kg/m2), obese class II (BMI of 35­39.9kg/m2),
and obese class III (BMI of 40kg/m2 (6). Hypertension was defined
as a systolic blood pressure 140mm Hg, a diastolic blood pressure
90mmHg, and/or self-reported antihypertensive medication use.
Diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose of 126mg/dl or self-
reporteduseofantidiabeticmedications.Cardiovasculardiseasewasbased
on participant report of a history of myocardial infarction or stroke.
Weight-related perceptions
To assess weight-related perceptions, we analyzed participant responses
to the following questions: 1. Do you consider yourself now to be

overweight, underweight, or about the right weight? 2. Would you

Trends and Disparities in Provider Diagnosis
of Overweight Analysis of NHANES 1999­2004
Nichola J. Davis1, Rachel P. Wildman2, Bernice F. Forbes2 and Clyde B. Schechter3
Rates of overweight and obesity are disproportionately high within minority populations. This study examined the
trends in provider diagnosis of overweight from 1999 to 2004 and examined whether there were differences in provider
diagnosis based on race/ethnicity. We examined data from 4,071 adults with BMI 30 who participated in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) (1999­2004). Provider diagnosis was determined by self-report.
From 1999 to 2004, the provider diagnosis of overweight decreased from 71 to 64% (P = 0.003). After controlling for
potential confounders, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less likely to report a provider diagnosis of
overweight compared to non-Hispanic whites. Odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) for non-Hispanic blacks
was 0.6 (95% CI, 0.4­0.8) and for Mexican Americans was 0.7 (95% CI, 0.4­1.0) compared to non-Hispanic whites.
Reasons for this disparity warrant further investigation.

like to weigh more, less, or stay about the same? Due to very few

"underweight" responses to question 1 and very few "more" responses
to 
question 2, these responses were set to missing for this analysis.
Statistical analyses
2-Tests compared prevalence estimates of provider diagnosis of
overweight among obese individuals across time periods within
categories of demographic and health history variables, and within
time periods across categories of demographic and health history
variables. We tested multiplicative interaction terms between time and
demographic variables and between time and health history variables.
Independent correlates of provider diagnosis were determined via
multiplelogisticregressionanalysiswithdatapooledacross1999­2004.
Based on prior studies (7,8), we included race/ethnicity, survey year,
obesity class, gender, education, age, health insurance, having a
routine health-care provider, number of provider visits, and comorbid
conditions in the models. Multivariable logistic regression assessed
race/ethnic differences in weight-related perceptions controlling for
age, sex, education, and obesity class. Analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN 9.0.1 (RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC),
employing techniques appropriate to the complex survey design of
NHANES 1999­2004. P values <0.05 were significant.
Results
We analyzed data from 4,107 obese adults; unweighted
proportions were 48.4% non-Hispanic white, 26.0% non-
Hispanic black, and 25.6% Mexican American. Non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans were more likely to have
missing data for BMI; however, non-Hispanic blacks were
more likely to be eligible for the current analyses due to
higher prevalence of obesity. In 1999, 71.2% of obese adults
reported provider diagnosis of overweight that decreased in
subsequent years to 66.7% in 2001 and 63.7% in 2004 (P value
for trend = 0.003). In each survey period, non-Hispanic blacks
and Mexican Americans were significantly less likely to be
diagnosed as overweight compared to non-Hispanic whites
(P < 0.001) (see Table 1). Women, having health insurance,
comorbid illnesses, and higher number of provider visits, were
associated with increased provider diagnosis in univariate
analyses. Interactions between time and age (P = 0.003), and
between time and health insurance (P = 0.007) were significant
such that the decrease in provider diagnosis was greatest for
middle-aged individuals and for individuals with insurance.
There were no significant interactions between time and gender
(P = 0.72) or between time and race/ethnicity (P = 0.18).
After controlling for potential confounders, non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans remained less likely to be

diagnosed as overweight when compared to non-Hispanic
whites (Table 2). Multivariate odds ratio (OR) for provider
diagnosis in non-Hispanic blacks was 0.6 (95% confidence
interval (CI), 0.4­0.8) and in Mexican Americans was 0.7 (95%
CI, 0.4­1.0). The degree of obesity increased the odds of pro-
vider diagnosis with adults in class III obesity having close to a
ninefold increase in the odds of provider diagnosis compared
to class I obesity (OR = 8.6, 95% CI 5.0­14.9). Diabetes was the
only comorbid illness that independently increased the odds of

provider diagnosis (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 2.0­4.4).
Participants with a provider diagnosis were more likely to
perceive themselves as overweight rather than the right weight
(95.9% among those reporting a provider diagnosis vs. 84.2%

Epidemiology
among those not reporting a provider diagnosis; P < 0.001)
and preferred to weigh less rather than stay the same weight
(96.7% vs. 87.6%, respectively; P < 0.001). After adjustment
for potential confounders, non-Hispanic blacks were five
times more likely to perceive themselves as being the right
weight rather than overweight (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 2.3­10.7)
and were four times more likely to prefer to weigh the same
rather than weigh less (OR = 3.9, 95% CI 1.9­8.2) when
compared to non-Hispanic whites (P < 0.001 for both). Non-
Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans did not differ in
weight-related perceptions.
Discussion
Using a nationally representative multiethnic sample with
measured height and weight, we have demonstrated 
decreasing
trends in provider diagnosis of overweight from 1999 to 2004.
Non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans were less likely
to be diagnosed compared to non-Hispanic whites 
highlighting
a potential disparity in obesity management.
Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
demonstrated that between 1994 and 2000 there was a decline
(from 44 to 40%) in obese respondents who reported being
advised to lose weight by a health-care professional (8). Our
findings indicate a similar trend with provider diagnosis sug-
gesting that despite increasing obesity prevalence, intervention
by health-care providers is declining. Of concern are the lower
rates of diagnosis among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans. Prior studies have cited time, beliefs that weight
loss counseling is ineffective, and lack of patient motivation
as barriers to health-care providers addressing obesity (9,10).
Given the complexity of addressing obesity and the influence
that culturally related factors such as diet may have on obesity,
we question whether patient race/ethnicity is an unrecognized
barrier in providers addressing obesity.
We additionally found that participants with provider
diagnosis were more likely to perceive themselves as overweight
and preferred to weigh less. Although it may seem unnecessary
to diagnose a patient as overweight or obese, it is possible that
adults living in communities with higher obesity prevalence
may view obesity as the social norm and not identify it as a
health problem. Indeed, non-Hispanic blacks have the highest
prevalenceofobesityandweremorelikelytoconsiderthemselves
the right weight in comparison to other groups, supporting
previous findings by Yancey et al. and Burroughs et al. (11,12).
This study has several strengths including a large sample size
with a diverse sampling of individuals and the use of measured
anthropometrics. Our primary outcome of provider diagnosis
is limited, however, because it is self-reported and subject
to recall bias and random error. Additionally, the context in
which adults were told about their weight and their weight
at the time of diagnosis may affect their ability to recall being
told. Finally, non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
were more likely to have missing data for BMI and provider
diagnosis, and our results may underestimate the problem of
decreased provider diagnosis.
In conclusion, our study suggests that provider diagnosis of
overweight among obese individuals has decreased between
1999 and 2004; this is despite prior reports of dramatically
increasing obesity prevalence during this time. Non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican Americans have lower rates of provider
diagnosis. Reasons for this disparity and its impact warrant
further investigation.
