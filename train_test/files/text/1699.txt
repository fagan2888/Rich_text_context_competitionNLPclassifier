Abstract
Elevated circulating total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations are related to increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
Folic acid fortification resulted in a significant decrease in circulating tHcy in the United States. In the post-folic acid forti-
fication period, associations between plasma tHcy and demographic, health, and lifestyle factors and B vitamin status were
investigated. Data from the 3 recent NHANES cycles (1999­2004) were used to study the associations among plasma
tHcy and sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, serum cotinine, vitamin/mineral supplement
use, and folate and cobalamin status in 16,254 persons (8329 men, 7925 women). Multivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy was
;9.7% higher in men than in women (P , 0.0001), ;5.3% higher in non-Hispanic whites than in non-Hispanic blacks
(P , 0.0001), ;64.5% higher in individuals aged $60 y than in individuals aged ,20 y (P , 0.0001), and ;5% higher in
supplement nonusers than in supplement users (P , 0.0001). Persons in the 4th quartile for serum creatinine, serum
cotinine, systolic BP, and serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) had ;36.1, ;13.4, ;5.6, and ;16.2%, respectively, higher
tHcy than those in the 1st quartile (P , 0.0001). Plasma tHcy was inversely associated with serum folate (P , 0.0001),
RBC folate (P , 0.0001), and serum cobalamin (P , 0.0001). In the post-folic acid fortification period, sex, race/ethnicity,
age, systolic BP, supplement use, RBC folate, and serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, and cobalamin are significant
determinants of plasma tHcy. Serum MMA was strongly associated with plasma tHcy. J. Nutr. 139: 345­352, 2009.
Introduction
Since 1 January 1998, all processed cereals in the United States
have been fortified with folic acid at the level of 140 mg/100 g
of food (1) in response to the Public Health Service's recom-
mendation that all women of child-bearing age should consume
400 mg/d of folic acid to reduce the risk of having a child with
neural tube defect (2). The actual increase in folic acid intake is
more than the predicted intake of 100 mg/d (3,4), because several
fortified foods contained higher amounts of folic acid than the
FDA mandated (5). There is a concern that some individuals
may be consuming more folic acid than the upper intake level of
1000 mg/d (6). Overall, folic acid fortification resulted in a
significant improvement in serum folate concentrations (7­11).
After an initial dramatic increase in serum folate following folic
acid fortification, the serum folate concentrations have recently
modestly but significantly decreased (7,8) due to the decreased
intakes of folic acid (12).
In addition to a reduction in neural tube defects (13), one
important benefit of mandated folic acid fortification is de-
creased total homocysteine (tHcy)4 concentrations (7­9,14).
Evidence from clinical and epidemiological studies suggests that
elevated tHcy in the circulation is linked to increased risk for
cardiovascular disease (CVD) (15,16) and decreased cognitive
function (17) and bone mineral density (18,19). It is not known
whether increased circulating tHcy leads to the development of
CVD or vice versa.
Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing, nonessential amino
acid formed from the demethylation of methionine. Genetic ab-
normalities[methylenetetrahydrofolatereductase (MTHFR)poly-
morphism] (20,21) and B vitamin deficiencies (22,23) are important
factors responsible for elevated tHcy concentrations. Hcy is
either remethylated to methionine or trans-sulfurated to cysteine.

In remethylation, folate is required as a substrate, and riboflavin
and cobalamin are required as coenzymes. In transsulfuration,
pyridoxine is used as a coenzyme (24,25). Decreased circulating
concentrations of folate, riboflavin, cobalamin, and pyridoxine
are associated with increased serum tHcy concentration (26­28),
whereas increased B vitamin status is related to decreased
tHcy (29). Sex, race/ethnicity, and age are related to tHcy
(26,27,30,31). Serum creatinine, a measure of renal function, and
smoking are directly associated with serum tHcy (26,27). The
association between tHcy and serum cotinine, a measure of
cigarette smoking, BMI, and methylmalonic acid (MMA), a
measure of cobalamin deficiency, has received little attention.
The majority of studies have focused on the determinants
of tHcy based on the data collected during the pre-folic acid
fortification period (26,27,32,33). Also, the majority of popu-
lation studies on the determinants of tHcy have focused on
folate. Because tHcy concentrations are significantly lower since
the years after the folic acid fortification (7,9,14), it is important
to identify the determinants of tHcy concentrations in the post-
folic acid fortification period. Therefore, the objective of this
study was to investigate the relation between plasma tHcy
concentrations and demographic, lifestyle, and health factors
and concentrations of circulating B vitamins and MMA in the
post-folic acid fortification period.
Materials and Methods
Survey description and study sample. The National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) of the CDC conducts NHANES on civilian,
noninstitutionalized residents of the US. NHANES were designed to be a
complex, stratified, multistage probability sample survey. Demographic,
socioeconomic, dietary, and health related data were collected in the
participants' homes as part of the household interview. A physician-
administered examination was conducted with household interviewed
persons in mobile examination centers (MEC). In NHANES, young
children, older persons, non-Hispanic black (NHB), and Mexican
American/Hispanic (MA/H) were oversampled to yield reliable estimates
for these groups. Beginning in 1999, NHANES were conducted as con-
tinuous, annual surveys rather than the periodic surveys. The NHANES
protocols were reviewed and approved by the NCHS Institutional
Review Board and all individuals gave their informed consent prior to
participation.
In this study, NHANES 1999­2000 (34), 2001­2002 (35), and
2003­2004 (36) were concatenated into 1 analytic database, NHANES
1999­2004, per guidelines from the NCHS. NHANES 1999­2000 was
conducted between March 1999 and December 2000 with 9965
individuals (all were home interviewed; 9282 were examined in MEC);
NHANES 2001­2002 was conducted between January 2001 and
December 2002 with 11,039 individuals (all were home interviewed;
10,477 were examined in MEC); and NHANES 2003­2004 was
conducted between January 2003 and December 2004 with 12,761
individuals (10,122 were home interviewed; 9643 were examined in
MEC). The detailed description of survey methodologies and analytical
guidelines has been described earlier (37­39).
In the data analysis, pregnant women (n ¼ 760); individuals who
reported their race/ethnicity as ``unknown'' or other than non-Hispanic
white (NHW), NHB, or MA/H (n ¼ 642); and individuals with missing
data for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, systolic blood pressure (BP),
diastolic BP, vitamin/mineral supplement use, RBC folate, and concen-
trations of serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, cobalamin, and MMAwere
excluded. After applying the above exclusion criteria, the study sample
consisted of 16,254 subjects (8329 men and 7925 women).
Measurements. NCHS collected data on body measurements, demog-
raphy, physical function, health condition, lifestyle behaviors, biochemical
measurements of blood and urine, and diet intake depending on the age of
the participant. Blood was collected from venipuncture in the MEC
according to the standard protocols. Of 16,254 participants, ;62% (n ¼
10,122) had fasted for $9 h and ;38% (n ¼ 6132) fasted for ,9 h. Data
on the length of fasting was missing for 13 participants. Length of fasting
had no measurable effect on the circulating tHcy (32). Whole blood was
collected into EDTA-treated tubes and centrifuged at 2900 3 g; 10 min at
4­8°C (V6500; Hamilton Bell) to yield plasma. Plasma tHcy concentra-
tions were determined using an immunoassay (Abbott Imx for NHANES
1999­2001 and Abbott AxSym for NHANES 2002­2004; Abbott
Laboratories,). A crossover study showed an excellent correlation between
the 2 Hcy methods (n ¼ 361; r2 ¼ 0.9817) (14). Folate and cobalamin
concentrations in serum and RBC folate in whole blood hemolysate
sample were measured using Quantaphase II radioassay kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories). Serum MMA was measured using GC/MS. Serum creat-
inine was measured using an autoanalyzer (Hitachi Model 917 for
NHANES 1999­2002; Beckman Synchron LX20 for NHANES 2003­
2004). Serum cotinine was measured using isotope dilution-HPLC/
atmospheric pressure chemical ionization tandem MS. The detailed
methodology on laboratory procedures is described elsewhere (40­42).
BP was measured using a mercury sphygmomanometer (W A Baum)
according to the standardized protocol recommended by the AHA (43).
Individuals who took vitamin/mineral supplements 1 mo before the
survey were categorized as supplement users. Serum cotinine was used as
a measure of intensity of smoking. Serum cotinine concentration was
correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked (44). Sex, race/ethnicity,
age, BMI, systolic BP, diastolic BP, vitamin/mineral supplement use, RBC
folate, and concentrations of serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, cobala-
min, and MMAwere selected as potential variables that would be related
to plasma tHcy concentrations in the post-folic acid fortification period.
Statistical analysis. SUDAAN statistical software (SUDAAN for
Windows, version 8.0.2, Research Triangle Institute) was used to
account for complex survey design. In data analysis, sample weights,
primary sampling units, and stratification variables were considered to
account for differential probabilities of selection and adjustments for
noncoverage and nonresponse bias per the NCHS guidelines. Also, we
used SAS (SAS for Windows, version 8.0, SAS Institute) in conjunction
with SUDAAN to manage and analyze data files.
In the NHANES 1999­2004, individuals aged .85 y were catego-
rized as 85 y to protect the confidentiality of survey participants. These
individuals were excluded from the analysis so that age could be used as
a continuous variable. Because of nonnormality distribution of plasma
tHcy, natural logarithmic transformation was used in the analysis to
satisfy the requirement for normality. Standard errors were estimated
with Taylor Linearization method, which takes NHANES complex
survey design into consideration.
The significant difference between men and women in selected
characteristics was determined with 2-tailed t tests. We used multivariate
linear regression to evaluate the simultaneous effects of selected pre-
dictors of plasma tHcy on plasma tHcy. Plasma tHcy concentrations
were determined for sex, race/ethnicity, age, BMI, systolic and diastolic
BP, supplement use, serum and RBC folates, and serum cotinine,
creatinine, cobalamin, and MMA variables. All continuous predictor
variables except age were divided into quartile cutoff points. Quartile
groups within the variable did not yield equal sample size because of the
specific cutoff values used in defining the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles
for the described variable. Age was classified into 4 categories: ,20 y,
20 to ,40 y, 40 to ,60 y, and $60 y. We used ANCOVA to determine
the sex-, race/ethnicity­, and age-adjusted and multivariate-adjusted
means for plasma tHcy concentrations. A pairwise comparison between
categories within the variable was made using a 2-tailed, unpaired t test
after testing the hypothesis with ANCOVA.
Additionally, we performed a multivariate regression analysis
between plasma tHcy and continuous variables (age, BMI, systolic and
diastolic BP, serum and RBC folates, and serum cobalamin, MMA,
cotinine, and creatinine,). Because of the lack of causal relation between
tHcy and MMA, 2 multivariate regression models were constructed, one
with serum cobalamin but without serum MMA and the other with
serum MMA but without serum cobalamin. We also calculated Pearson
correlation coefficients between plasma tHcy and continuous variables.
Significance was set at P , 0.05.

Results
Characteristics of the study population are presented (Table 1).
The study sample consisted of ;51% men, ;49% women,
;43% NHW, ;24% NHB, and ;33% MA/H. More women
than men consumed vitamin/mineral supplements. Based on
serum cotinine concentrations, more men than women were
categorized as smokers. Women were slightly but significantly
older than men. BMI did not differ between the sexes. Systolic
and diastolic BP and concentrations of serum creatinine and
cotinine were significantly higher in men than in women and
concentrations of serum and RBC folates and serum cobalamin
were significantly higher in women than in men. Serum MMA
concentrations did not differ between women and men.
Unadjusted and multivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy concen-
trations for sex, age, and race/ethnicity are presented (Table 2).
Unadjusted plasma tHcy was ;18.4% higher in men than in
women. After adjustment for several covariates, the tHcy was
;9.7% higher in men than in women. Multivariate-adjusted
tHcy was higher (;5.0%) in NHW than in NHB and MA/H, but
NHB and MA/H did not differ in plasma tHcy. Age was
significantly associated with plasma tHcy in both unadjusted
and multivariate-adjusted models. Multivariate-adjusted plasma
tHcy was ;22.9% higher in individuals aged 20 to ,40 y,
;38.5% higher in individuals aged 40 to ,60 y, and ;64.5%
higher in individuals aged $60 y than in individuals aged ,20 y.
Associations between plasma tHcy and health and lifestyle
factors are presented (Table 3). Multivariate-adjusted plasma
tHcy was directly related to systolic BP (r ¼ 0.22; P , 0.0001),
serum creatinine (r ¼ 0.32; P , 0.0001), and serum cotinine (r ¼
0.12; P , 0.0001). Persons in the 4th quartile group for systolic
BP, serum creatinine, and cotinine had ;5.6, ;36.1, and
;11.2%, respectively, higher plasma tHcy than those in the
1st quartile group. Persons who reported supplements use had
;5% lower plasma tHcy than those who did not report use of
supplements. In the multivariate-adjusted analysis, plasma tHcy
was not significantly related to BMI and diastolic BP.
Associations between plasma tHcy and blood concentrations of
B vitamins and MMA are presented (Table 4). Plasma tHcy was

folate (r ¼ 20.05; P , 0.0001), RBC folate (r ¼ 20.03; P ¼

positively correlated with the serum MMA concentration (r ¼
0.43; P , 0.0001). Persons in the first quartile group for serum
folate, RBC folate, and serum cobalamin concentrations had
;19.2, ;5.6, and ;16.3%, higher plasma tHcy than those in the
4th quartile, respectively, and those in the 4th quartile for MMA
had ;16.3% higher plasma tHcy than those in first quartile group.
Additionally, associations between plasma tHcy and contin-
uous variables are presented (Table 5). Among all continuous
variables examined in the multivariate linear regression model,
serum MMA was strongly, positively associated with plasma
tHcy (b ¼ 0.1923; r ¼ 0.43), followed by age (b ¼ 0.0077; r ¼
0.33) and serum creatinine (b ¼ 0.003; r ¼ 0.32). Serum folate
was weakly, negatively associated with plasma tHcy (b ¼
20.0016; r ¼ 20.05). Linear regression analysis confirmed that
BMI and diastolic BP were not related to plasma tHcy.
Discussion
To date, this is the most comprehensive report on the population
determinants of plasma tHcy concentrations in the post-folic
acid fortification era. In this study, we report modifiers of plasma
tHcy concentrations in a nationally representative sample
utilizing the data from 3 NHANES cycles conducted in the
post-folic acid fortification period. Concatenating the 3 surveys
into 1 analytic data file resulted in a large sample size that not
only allowed us to use several covariates in the regression
modeling but also increased the precision of the estimate. In the
post-folic acid fortification period, sex, age, race, supplement
use, RBC folate, and serum creatinine, cotinine, folate, and

cobalamin were significant determinants of plasma tHcy.
Among all continuous variables examined, serum MMA showed
the strongest association with plasma tHcy. Serum folate was a
weak determinant of tHcy.
Multivariate-adjusted plasma tHcy was ;0.73 mmol/L
greater in men than in women. Given the differences in folate
and cobalamin status, vitamin/mineral supplements use, and
serum creatinine and cotinine concentrations between men and
women, it was expected that men would have higher tHcy than
women. After adjustment for these variables, the difference in
tHcy between men and women persisted, suggesting metabolic
causes for the differences in tHcy between men and women. In
men, the renal cystathionine b synthase activity is significantly
lower than in women, leading to higher tHcy. The renal
cystathinone synthase is a testosterone-dependant enzyme that
converts Hcy to cysteine in transsulfuration pathway (45).
Age is a significant determinant of plasma tHcy in the post-
fortification period after considering several covariates in the
multivariate model. The tHcy concentrations are significantly
lower across the age groups in the postfortification period
compared with the prefortification period (27). The extent of
decrease in circulating tHcy from pre- to postfortification period
is by and large similar across the age groups. For example, in the
prefortification period (NHANES 1988­1994), tHcy concen-
trations were 9.1, 9.4, 10.8, and 12.5 mmol/L in ,30 y, 30­50 y,
50­70 y, and $70 y olds, respectively (27), whereas in this study,
tHcy concentrations were 6.2, 7.3, 8.3, and 9.7 mmol/L in ,20 y,
20­40 y, 40­60 y, and $60 y age groups, respectively. Due to
methodological differences between NHANES 1988­1994 and
NHANES 19991, caution should be used in comparing the data
across the NHANES. In this study, plasma tHcy in the $60-y-old
age group was ;3.5 mmol/L greater than in the ,20-y-old age
group. Age-related increase in tHcy is unrelated to folate status,
because serum folate and RBC folates are significantly higher in
older persons compared with younger persons (7). Age-related
increase in circulating tHcy is due to multiple causes. These
include age-dependent decrease in enzymes that metabolize
Hcy (46), declined renal function (47), and increased cobalamin
deficiency due to malabsorption of cobalamin by the aging
gut (48).
In the postfortification period, race/ethnicity was a significant
determinant of plasma tHcy. Although the folic acid fortification
resulted in a significant increase in folate status (7­11) and
decrease in tHcy (7,9,14), race/ethnicity disparities exist in
plasma tHcy concentrations in the US. In this study, multivariate-
adjusted plasma tHcy was significantly higher (5.3% or
;0.4 mmol/L) in NHW than in NHB. This is despite higher
folate status in NHW compared with NHB (7). This can be
explained by lower serum cobalamin concentrations and an
increased prevalence of MTHFR polymorphism in NHW than
in NHB. Additional analysis on this current study data revealed
that sex- and age-adjusted serum cobalamin concentrations were

significantly lower in NHW (369 pmol/L) than in NHB (430
pmol/L; P , 0.0001). Similar to our finding, Stabler et al. (49)
previously reported significantly lower cobalamin concentra-
tions in white women than in black women. Because cobalamin
is a coenzyme for methionine synthase (required for remethy-
lation of Hcy to methionine), an inverse association between
serum cobalamin and tHcy concentrations is expected. Muta-
tion in the MTHFR gene (677C/T) results in reduced activity
of MTHFR, especially in those with low folate status. MTHFR
activity is reduced to 34% in TTand 71% in CT relative to wild-
type CC (50). MTHFR converts N5 N10 methylenetetrahydro-
folate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which is a methyl donor for
remethylation of Hcy to methionine. Persons with homozygosity
for 677C/T (TT) (present in ;12% NHW) have increased
circulating tHcy concentrations (20) and have a greater require-
ment for folate compared with those with the CT or CC
genotype (51). Because folate status has dramatically improved
in the post-folic acid fortification period (7­11), the impact of
MTHFR polymorphism on tHcy would be reduced in the
postfortification era.
In this study, plasma tHcy and cotinine, a biochemical marker
of smoking, were directly related in the post-folic acid fortifica-
tion period. There was a similar relationship between cotinine
and tHcy in the pre-folic acid fortification period (NHANES
1988­1994) (P ¼ 0.0001) (27), suggesting that the association
between cotinine and tHcy is not modified as a result of folic acid
fortification. Serum cotinine is a reliable biochemical marker of
smoking, because self-reported smoking is often underreported
(52). Also, serum cotinine accounts for second-hand smoking. In
this study, persons who are in the 4th quartile for serum cotinine
had ;0.84 mmol/L higher plasma tHcy than those in the first
quartile. Although the exact mechanism through which cotinine
influences tHcy is not known, the likely explanation for high tHcy
in smokers is low folate, cobalamin, and pyridoxine status (53­
55) and decreased activity of methionine synthase (56,57).
Systolic BP was a significant determinant of plasma tHcy in
the postfortification period. Persons with $129 mm Hg systolic
BP had ;0.57 mmol/L higher tHcy than did persons with systolic
BP ,108 mm Hg. These results support the previously reported
direct relation between tHcy and BP in the Hordaland Homo-
cysteine Study by Refsum et al. (16). Rasmussen et al. (33) found
a direct relation between systolic BP and tHcy in younger
subjects. However, it is not known exactly whether increased
tHcy leads to increased BP or increased BP leads to increased
tHcy concentrations.
Inverse associations between serum folate, RBC folate, and
serum cobalamin and tHcy concentrations reported in this study
are in accordance with earlier studies using the data collected in
the prefortification period (26,27). Earlier, we reported that folic
acid fortification resulted in a 130­150% increase in mean
serum folate concentrations and decreased prevalence of low
serum folate from 18.4 to 0.2% from pre- to postfortification
period in the US (7). In Canada, folic acid fortification improved
serum folate by ;51­67% (58). Given the dramatic increase in
folate status in the postfortification era, the decrease in plasma
tHcy is anticipated. In this study, persons in the first quartile for
serum folate had ;1.4 mmol/L higher tHcy compared with those
in the 4th quartile. However, the inverse association between
serum folate and tHcy was weak, albeit significant. Quinlivan
et al. (59) reported that dependency of tHcy on folic acid
gradually diminished in women when they received sequential
supplementation of 100, 200, and 400 mg/d of folic acid. Folic
acid fortification resulted in an increased intake of .200 mg/d of
folic acid (4). Thus, the weakened relation between serum folate
and plasma tHcy in this study was likely due to improved folate
status from the mandated folic acid fortification. Because of this
improved folate status in the postfortification period (7­11), low
cobalamin status has emerged as the dominant determinant of
circulating tHcy (60,61). Liaugaudas et al. (60) reported that
population-attributable risk percentages for hyperhomocystei-
nemia were 1% for serum folate , 5 mg/L (11.33 nmol/L) and
24.5% for serum cobalamin , 250 pg/mL (184.5 pmol/L) in
patients with stable coronary artery disease. Similarly, in the
Sacramento Latino Study (61), the population-attributable risk
percentages for hyperhomocysteinemia were 29.7% for serum
cobalamin , 148 pmol/L and 0.3% for RBC folate , 365 nmol/L
in subjects aged $60 y.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a direct
relation between serum MMA and plasma tHcy in a nationally
representative sample that supports the previous observation in
a convenience sample by Koehler et al. (62). MMA is considered
a sensitive marker of cobalamin deficiency. In cobalamin de-
ficiency, MMA is derived from the hydrolysis of methylmalonyl-
CoA due to decreased function of cobalamin-dependant
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, which converts methylmalonyl-
CoA to succinyl-CoA (63). Both tHcy and MMA are elevated in
cobalamin deficiency. The severity of cobalamin deficiency is
associated with increased circulating MMA and tHcy (64).
However, serum MMA is not a gold standard for cobalamin
deficiency, because a significant number of elderly persons with
high cobalamin status had high MMA concentrations. This was
likely due to declined renal function rather than true cobalamin
deficiency (64). Because of stronger association between serum
MMA and plasma tHcy in the post-folic acid fortification
period, screening for cobalamin deficiency is important, espe-
cially in older persons who are at risk for cobalamin deficiency.
Due to the cross-sectional nature of this study, assessment of
cause and effect relation was not possible. Because plasma tHcy
concentrations have changed inversely in response to changes in
serum folate concentrations (7,9­11), plasma tHcy can be used
as a biochemical marker in assessing the impact of folic acid

fortification at population level. In the US, plasma tHcy
concentrations have declined by 8­10% in men and by 3­13%
in women as a result of mandated folic acid fortification (14). If
elevated tHcy is associated with increased risk for CVD, then the
decreased tHcy would have an opposite effect on CVD. So far,
the controlled trials addressing this question have yielded some
positive results (65). Yang et al. (66) reported that the stroke
mortality has declined from the pre- to postfortification period
in the US and Canada. Because of the rise and fall of serum folate
concentrations after folic acid fortification, it is important to
monitor the impact of nationwide mandated folic acid fortifi-
cation on overall health and well being of U.S. residents on a
continuous basis.
