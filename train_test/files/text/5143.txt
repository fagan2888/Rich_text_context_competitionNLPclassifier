Abstract: We have studied gift giving at Christmas among 50 graduate students in Norway.
The students invested more the closer the coefficient of relatedness. However, partners
ranked highest, which is natural for people at the start of their reproductive career. All
students gave to their parents, siblings, and children, most gave to their grandparents, and
only a third gave to some, but not all, of their genetic aunts/uncles. Twenty percent gave to
first cousins, and none to second or third cousins. Similar patterns for gifts received were
found. There were also sex differences (e.g. women had larger exchange networks than
men), and birth order effects. Firstborns spent more on relatives than laterborns. However,
middleborns gave more to their male friends than both firstborns and lastborns. We conclude
that the results are consistent with theories of kin selection, reciprocity, sex differences and
birth order effects.
Keywords: gift giving, kin selection, reciprocity, sex differences, birth order.

Introduction
Gift giving is a central aspect of human behavior and culture (Carrier, 1995; Cheal,
1988; Davis, 1992, Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1980; Lévi-Strauss, 1969; Mauss,
1950/1990) and may be classified as a human universal (Brown, 1991; Fox, 1980; Murdock,
1945). The human tendency to reciprocate a gift may be classified as a "human instinct"
(Ridley, 1996, p. 121). The importance of a gift is usually not the transfer of an object in
itself, but the social aspect, especially in terms of obligations, namely to give, to receive, and
to reciprocate (Mauss, 1950/1990).
In the old Norwegian Gulating law and other old Germanic law it was actually stated
that a gift should be valued with an equal gift in return (Hamre, 1960). In the old
Scandinavian civilization, as well as in a number of others, exchanges and contracts take
place in the form of presents which are voluntary in theory, but are given and reciprocated
obligatory in reality (Mauss, 1950/1990). The notion of reciprocity seems to be a central
aspect of gift giving among humans in all cultures (e.g. Cheal, 1986; Davis, 1972; Hamre,
Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
1960; Lévi-Strauss, 1969; Mauss, 1950/1990; Sahlins, 1965, cited by Alexander 1975).
Reciprocal giving of gifts is also a marked feature of the Christmas festivities in England
(Lowes et al., 1971), the United States (Caplow, 1984) and Canada (Cheal, 1986).
Although some repayment is expected for any gift, it is crucial that it be deferred. To
reciprocate at once indicates a desire to end the relationship, whereas delayed payment
makes the strings between giver and receiver longer and stronger (Mauss, 1950/1990). Note
that Christmas gifts represent an exception in this regard because the gifts given and
received are expected to be exchanged simultaneously (Cheal, 1988; Davis, 1992). In
addition, it is typical that Christmas gifts are distributed at gatherings where every person
gives and receives gifts (Caplow, 1984).
Alexander (1975) analyzed Sahlins' (1965, cited by Alexander 1975) review of the
anthropological social-exchange literature and noted that the review supported general
expectations of the theories of kin selection (Hamilton, 1964) and reciprocal altruism
(reciprocity) (Trivers, 1971). Essock-Vitale and McGuire (1980) reviewed the
anthropological exchange literature in light of these two evolutionary theories. Five
predictions were all supported in most studies reviewed. 1. Kin will be given more
unreciprocated help than non-kin, with close kin receiving the most unreciprocated help. 2.
Kin will be given more help than non-kin, with close kin receiving the most help. 3.
Friendships will be reciprocal. 4. Large gifts and long-term loans are most likely to come
from kin. 5. Individuals requiring unreciprocated help over long periods of time will
gradually be abandoned by their former helpers. Even though Essock-Vitale and McGuire
(1980) discussed the broader aspect of helping behavior, gift-giving behavior was a central
part of their focus. But most of the data they reviewed was qualitative rather than
quantitative. We wanted to extend the quantitative part of the data base on gift-giving
behavior and focus on the first four of their five predictions.
A partner is the prerequisite for successful reproduction. We therefore tested if
partners were given the most expensive gifts. We also asked if having a partner would affect
the gift-giving behavior relative to single individuals. We also studied if there were any sex
differences in gift-giving behavior. Because women are the most investing sex in the
offspring with larger need for all kinds of support and protection for themselves and their
offspring (Judge, 1995; Judge and Hrdy, 1992), they may have a larger network of persons
they exchange gifts with than men.
Finally, we asked if there were any birth-order effects (Davis, 1997; Hertwig, Davis,
and Sulloway, 2002; Paulhus, Trapnell and Chen, 1999; Rohde et.al., 2003; Salmon, 1998,
1999; Salmon and Daly, 1998; Sulloway, 1996, 2001) in gift giving. Sulloway (1996)
documented substantive birth-order effects for several personality traits, and we wanted to
test if functional firstborns (hereafter firstborns) differed from functional laterborns
(hereafter laterborns) when concerning investment in their relatives. Since for example
firstborns identify more strongly with parents and with authority, we expected that they
might invest more in their close relatives than laterborns. Several studies have found that
middleborns are distinct from first- and lastborns (Kennedy, 1989; Kidwell, 1982; Rohde et
al., 2003; Salmon, 1998; Salmon and Daly, 1998; Sulloway, 1996), for example
middleborns were less likely to indicate having a close relationship with their parents
(Kennedy, 1989). We wanted to test if middleborns invested less in their close relatives than
first- and lastborns or in other ways had different gift-giving behavior at Christmas.

Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
Methods
Fifty graduate students out of a possible 338 at Department of Biology, University of
Oslo in Norway were interviewed during January 7-20 1998 about their gift behavior before
and at Christmas 1997. The inclusion criteria was 1) Christian background, and 2) not
entered paid work. The interviews were conducted by two of us (IM and TD), 25 each.
Twenty-five males and 25 females were interviewed in private for 30-60 minutes, depending
on how many people each of them had given gifts to. We did not inform about the
theoretical background for the study but stressed that all answers were confidential.
We first asked about age, birth order (including number of brothers and sisters,
number of year between them as firstborn and the next brother or sister or as later born and
the elder brother or sister next to them), address, civil status (married/co-inhabitant, with or
without girl/boyfriend), how long they had been together with their partner, if their parents
were married or divorced, and if divorced, when that happened, and if their parents had new
partners. We also asked why they give presents at Christmas. We then asked about each
person they had given a gift to: sex, age, the student's relation to them, birth-order
parameters (see above), address, occupation and if they were working, how often he/she
talked and met them, if they subjectively felt that the person in question lived far away, how
much time it usually took to visit them, when they bought/made the gift, what was given, the
price of it, if they bought/made the gift themselves, how many people shared the expenses
on the gift, what was received, price of what was received, and how many people gave the
received gift. Then we noted possible relatives (aunts, uncles, first cousins, nieces, nephews
aso.) they did not give anything to, and why nothing was given. We also asked if they had
received anything from persons they did not return a gift to and noted the student's relation
to them and what was given. We asked if they had any relatives they did not get anything
from. Finally we asked what kind of "gift philosophy" they used among six alternatives, or if
they used other principles. The least relevant data are omitted from this paper.
The students were generally positive to and interested in the project. It was our
impression that they answered honestly and in most cases remembered well who they had
given to, what they had given and the price of it, and what they had received. They had more
difficulty with the price of what they had received. In many instances they had no idea about
it, which is as expected with a norm of not asking about the price of a gift received.
Characteristics of the study population
The students' age lay between 23 and 31 years with a mean age of 26.0 years (SD =
1.8); 26.0 years (SD = 2.1) for women and 26.1 years (SD = 1.6) for men. There were 28
firstborns and 22 laterborns in the sample (12 firstborn men, 16 firstborn women, 13
laterborn men, and 9 laterborn women). Mean age of these four categories was 26.0 (SD =
.9), 25.8 (SD = 1.9), 26.2 (SD = 2.1) and 26.0 (SD = 2.6), respectively. The laterborns
consisted of 9 middleborns and 13 lastborns (5 middleborn men, 4 middleborn women, 8
lastborn men, 5 lastborn women), with mean ages 26.8 (SD = 2.2), 27.8 (SD = 3.0), 25.9 (SD
= 2.1), and 25.2 (SD = 1.3), respectively. Thus, for both sexes, first- and laterborns, and
first-, middle-, and laterborns, the ages were similar and the group pretty homogenous. Age
of student was positively correlated with father´s age (p = .01), but not with mother's age (p
= .34). Firstborns had younger mothers, but not younger fathers, than laterborns (p < .001

and p = .12, respectively). Firstborns and laterborns did not differ in how old their
grandparents were (p = .19). There was no association between the grandparents' age and
the students' age (p = .22).
Forty-two of the students had parents who were still married, five had divorced
parents, and the parents of three students were widows/widowers. Forty-eight had genetic
uncles and/or aunts, and 38 had grandparents alive. Five students were married, 16 were
living together without being married, 12 had a girl/boyfriend, 16 had no girl/boyfriend at
the moment and one was in the "other" category (no longer cohabiting, child from prior
cohabitation). The latter was excluded from the variable civil status in the statistical
analyses. If one focuses on the period of time the students had been married, been living
together or had a girl/boyfriend, the mean duration was 4.3 years (SD = 2.1; n = 25 available
for analysis). The students gave to a mean of 2.2 friends (SD = 2.7).
Coding of data and statistical analyses
When coding for functional birth order sensu Sulloway (1996) and Salmon and Daly
(1998), one laterborn twin was coded as lastborn (the pair of twins was lastborn with one
older sibling) and only children (two men, one woman) were coded as firstborn. To test for
linear effects, firstborns were coded as 1, middleborns as 2, and lastborns as 3, and to test for
quadratic effects, these three birth orders were coded as -1, 2, and -1, respectively.
The statistical analyses were done by means of the program S-PLUS version 4.5,
using standard tests such as paired t-test, ANOVA and Pearson regression analysis. For all
regressions and ANOVAs, the assumptions of the models were checked (homogeneity of
variance by means of residual plots, normality of the data by means of QQ-plots) and log-
transformation (ln) of the variables performed if necessary. For imbalanced data sets,
adjusted means are presented (instead of means). For the logistic regression analyses, the
validity of the conclusions was checked by looking at the residual deviance, testing for
overdispersion and using dispersion test. To save space, we mostly report only the p-values
(alpha significance level of 0.5).
Results
All students gave and received gifts. They gave gifts to a total of 550 persons (M:
11.1, SE = .8), what we have termed "gift-giving relations", and received gifts from a total
of 537 persons (mean: 10.7, SE = .8), what we have termed "gift-receiving relations". These
numbers did not differ (p = .42). The students gave a total of 719 gifts (mean: 14.4, SD =
1.1) and received 616 gifts (mean: 12.3, SE = 1.0), and so they gave more than they received
(p < .01). The total number of gifts given by a student was highly correlated with the total
number of gifts received (p < .001). The average student spent NOK 1501 (SE = 112)
(approximately $190) in total for Christmas gifts (self-made gifts excluded). Excluding self-
made gifts, and cases where we did not know the price, the average student spent NOK 173
(SE = 11) per gift-giving relation.
Relatives and partners
All students of both sexes gave gifts to their closest family (to all mothers, fathers,
brothers, sisters and children). They also received gifts from at least one parent and own

children above a certain age. Thirty-two of 38 gave to their grandparents (Table 1), and 32
also received gifts from at least one of them. Forty-five of 46 received gifts from at least one
of their siblings.

1. Persons may be listed in more than one of these four categories, e.g. due to both having given to mother's
mother and mother's father.
Twenty-one of the students gave gifts to at least one of their uncles and/or aunts,
while 22 received gifts from at least one. Out of 48 who had first cousins, only 10 students
gave to one or more of them, and nine received gifts from one or more.
Of 27 students who received one or more gifts (mean 2.4), with a value above NOK
544 (mean value for all), 22 got it from their parents, four from their siblings, and five from
their grandparents. Of non-kin, partners were on top with eight students receiving such gifts.
Note that a student may be counted in more than one category.
In terms of money spent, the students gave significantly more to partners than to
each of the other categories (all p < .01), relatively equally to their parents and siblings, and
an equal, but less, amount to people in each of the other categories (Figure 1). They tended

to give slightly more to parents than siblings (p = .08), and more to parents than to
grandparents, genetic uncles/aunts, first cousins, friends, other family and "others" (all p <
.02). The students also gave more to siblings than to grandparents, genetic uncles/aunts,
friends, other family and "others" (p < .007). They also spent more money on friends than
on people in category "others" (p = .005).

No correlation existed between the mean value of money spent on gifts to parents,
siblings, grandparents, genetic uncles/aunts, first cousins, and nephews/nieces, and their
respective coefficients of relatedness with these relatives (p = .69). However, organizing the
data with all data points for giving to each of these six categories as one response variable, a
regression with coefficient of relatedness as predictor was highly significant (p < .001; log-
transformed response variable): the larger coefficient of relatedness (r), the more money was
spent on gifts. To see if each person invested in each of these same six categories in
proportion to degree of relatedness, we added number of persons the students could have
given to when estimating mean values (which only affected gifts to grandparents, genetic
uncles/aunts, and first cousins) (Figure 2). Roughly, students invested twice as much in
parents and siblings (r = .5) as in grandparents and nephews/nieces (r = .25), but much less
in genetic uncles/aunts. In first cousins (r = .125), they invested equally little as in genetic
uncles/aunts. The correlation between the means for each category and the coefficient of
relatedness was fairly high (p < .02).

More money was spent on gifts to mothers the closer she lived (p = .01), and the
more often a student talked with her (p < .05), although the latter relationship was no longer
significant when controlling for distance (p = .14). If we combine birth order, civil status,
how often a student talked to the mother, and distance to where she lived in the same model,
there was no significant interaction between the four factors. Using type III Sum of Squares,
distance to where mother lived did not add to the model. Removing this variable, there were
significant effects of birth order (p = .01), civil status (p < .01), and frequency of talking (p
< .01). We found no association between mean amount of money given to mothers and
fathers and the mean age of the mothers and fathers (p = .69 and p = .43, respectively, log-
transformed response variables). Likewise, money spent on grandparents was unrelated to
the mean age of grandparents (p = .87; log-transformed response variable). When
controlling for number of brothers, the students' age could explain a significant proportion
of the variance on how much was spent on gifts to brothers (p < .03): the older the student,
the less was given to brothers.
Many students did not give gifts to "half near" family (i.e. grandparents, aunts and
uncles or first cousins), and we asked them why. Twenty-two of the 50 students answered
that it was due to sparse contact, 18 answered that it was due to tradition or convention in
the family of not doing so, and nine replied that they could not afford it or that it would be
too many to give to. Only two gave to all first cousins, aunts, uncles and so forth. Note that
most of the persons the students referred to as "half near" family were first cousins, and that
the students were allowed to give more than one score.
The more often the students talked with their female friends, the more was spent on

Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
gifts to them (p = .02). This was also nearly significant when controlling for number of
female friends given to (p = .06).
Civil status
There was a significant correlation between number of gift-giving relations and civil
status (p = .002): married/cohabiting students had more gift-giving relations than unmarried
ones without partner, and the latter had fewer gift-giving relations than unmarried ones with
partner. This held also true when excluding friends from the analysis (p < .001). Focusing
on number of friends given to, there was no effect of civil status. There was no interaction
between sex of giver and civil status on number of gift-giving relations, but significant main
effects for both (sex: p < .001; civil status: p < .01; type III sum of squares). Similarly, there
was a significant correlation between (log-transformed) number of gift-receiving relations
and civil status (p < .001): married/cohabiting and unmarried with partner both had more
gift-receiving relations than unmarried ones without partner (adjusted means of 12.8, 11.7,
and 6.6, respectively). There was no interaction between sex of giver and civil status, but
there were significant main effects for both (sex: p < .001; civil status: p < .001; type III
sum of squares).
Married/cohabitant gave more gifts than unmarried with and without partner
(adjusted means of 17.8, 13.7, and 9.3, respectively; p = .001). Similar results were found
for gifts received (adjusted means of 14.6, 12.6, and 8.1, respectively; p = .002). Similarly,
married/cohabitant spent more money than unmarried with partner, who again spent more
than unmarried without partner (adjusted means of NOK 1729, 1608, and 1073,
respectively; p < .02). However, when controlling for number of gift-giving relations the
effect of civil status was no longer significant (p = .33).
Married/cohabitant gave gifts worth more to their partner than unmarried with
partner (adjusted means of NOK 742 and 461, respectively; p = .01). However,
married/cohabitant students spent less money on gifs to their mothers than both unmarried
with and without partner (adjusted means of NOK 183, 225, and 293, respectively; p = .01).
Sex differences
Women had more gift-giving relations than men (modal numbers of 13 and 8,
respectively; p < .001). When excluding friends from the analysis, no statistical association
with sex of giver was found. Women gave to many more friends than men (mean number of
3.9 and 0.6, respectively; p < .001). There was no correlation between how many non-
friends the students gave to (mainly own and partner's family) and number of friends they
gave to (p = .39)
Women had also more gift-receiving relations than men (modal numbers of 13 and 8,
respectively; p < .001). When excluding friends from the analysis, a tendency for women to
receive gifts from more persons than men still existed (mean values of 9.1 and 6.8,
respectively; p < .06). Men hardly ever received gifts from friends (mean value of 0.3 for
men and 3.2 for women; p < .001). Similarly, women gave more gifts than men (mean
values of 18.5 and 10.2, respectively; p < .001), and received more gifts (mean values of
16.5 and 8.1, respectively; p < .001).
Women spent more on gifts than men (mean values of NOK 1859 and 1143,

Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
respectively; p < .001). Number of gift-giving relations (excluding relations which only
were given a self-made gift or where the price was unknown) was correlated with money
spent in total (p < .001). Controlling for this factor revealed that the sex link was still
present (p = .05). Sex of giver could not explain the variation in any of the relation
categories, with the exception of partners: there was a tendency for women to give more
than men to partners (adjusted means of NOK 707 and 515, respectively; p = .09), which
was significant if an outlier was removed (p < .05).
Controlling for number of sisters, the only factors that explained how much was
spent on gifts to sisters were sex of giver, age and their interaction (number of sisters: p =
.44; sex: p = .04; age: p < .01; and sex*age: p = .03; log-transformed response variable,
type III Sum of Squares). The older the student, the less was spent on gifts to sisters, but
below age 25, men spent more than women, while above this age, women spent more than
men. Women both talked to and met their sisters more often than did men (p < .01 and p <
.001, respectively), even when controlling for age (p < .01 for both).
We classified a response variable for students who bought/made all gifts themselves
(n = 20) versus students who had someone else buy/make at least one of the gifts (n = 30).
One-way logistic regressions revealed no influence of sex or age of giver. Logistic
regression of the giftmakers (8) and non-giftmakers (42) showed that sex of giver, but not
age or birth order (linear and quadratic), could explain this habit (p < .001). All eight
giftmakers were women. Five of them gave at least one such gift to a friend.
Birth order
Firstborns spent more than laterborns per gift-giving relation (adjusted means of
NOK 188 and 154, respectively; p = .05). In general, firstborns gave more to their parents
and grandparents than laterborns (Figure 3; p < .01 for both). The statistical tests were done
on log-transformed response variables, but Figure 3 shows the untransformed ones.
Firstborns gave much more to their mothers than laterborns (adjusted means of NOK 267
and 177, respectively; p = .03), and also more to fathers (adjusted means of NOK 269 and
153, respectively; p = .005). Money spent on fathers correlated with distance to where the
father was living (p = .04). However, combining distance and birth order in the same model,
there was no interaction and distance to father's home added little (distance: p < .10, birth
order: p = .01; type III Sum of Squares).
We tested if birth order influenced how often the students talked to and met their
closest relatives. Almost significant quadratic effects for how often they met mothers (p <
.06) and fathers (p = .08; log-transformed response variables) were found. Firstborns had
more such contact with their fathers than lastborns (adjusted means of 3.05 and 2.71,
respectively), but lastborns had more contact with their mothers than firstborns (adjusted
means of 3.42 and 3.05, respectively). Middleborns met their mothers and fathers least often
(adjusted means of 2.36 and 2.33, respectively). We therefore tested if the linear birth-order
effects found for how much was spent on gifts to mothers and fathers were still present
when controlling for how often the students met their parents. The effects were still present
(p = .01 for both tests).

Linear effects of how often the students talked with their sisters were found (p < .01;
log-transformed response variable): laterborns talked more often with their sisters than
firstborns, even when controlling for number of sisters (p = .01). For how much was given
to siblings, only near-significant quadratic birth-order effects were found (p = .06).
However, the more siblings the students had, the less money was spent on gifts to each of
them (p < .01), and when controlling for number of siblings, quadratic birth-order effects
disappeared (p = .64). Controlling for number of brothers, firstborns gave more to brothers
than laterborns (p = .02). There was also a quadratic birth-order effect (p < .05), but it was
not quite significant when controlling for number of brothers (p = .08). Combining birth
order (linear) and age in the same model, there was no interaction, and age was most
important for money spent on gifts to brothers (age: p < .04; birth order: p < .07; type III
Sum of Squares). Firstborns received gifts of higher value from their brothers than did
lastborns, who in turn received more than middleborns (adjusted means of 5.65, 5.23, and
4.73, respectively; p = .04; log-transformed response variable). With exception of this
finding, we found no significant birth order effects on how much was received from the
various groups of relatives.
In logistic regressions, we considered people who had aunts and a yes-no to if they
gave to at least one of them, as response variable. We then performed one-way analyses with
several predictor variables. Only birth order was significant; more firstborns than laterborns
gave to aunts (p < .01). No such relationship held for uncles. When controlling for number
of male friends given to, middleborns gave for more to each of their male friends than both
firstborns (adjusted means of 5.52 and 4.21, respectively) and lastborns (adjusted mean of
4.18; p = .03).

Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
A lower proportion of middleborns (0 of 9) than firstborns (13 of 28) and lastborns
(7 of 13) procured all gifts by themselves, which means that a higher proportion of
middleborns had someone else procure at least one of their gifts (logistic regression, p =
.001).
DISCUSSION
All students gave and received gifts, consistent with other findings that gift giving at
Christmas is very common in Western societies (Borch, 1994, 1998; Caplow, 1982; Cheal,
1988; Lowes et al., 1971). They gave to an average of 11.1 persons and received gifts from
10.7 persons, and they gave a mean of 14.5 gifts and received 12.3. The gift-giving networks
of our students are thus in accordance with what has been found in other studies which
include a greater diversity of people than students only (Borch, 1994; Dunbar and Spoors,
1995; Milardo, 1988; Otnes, Lowrey and Kim, 1993). The number of gifts exchanged were
also within the ranges found elsewhere (Borch, 1994; Caplow, 1982; Caron and Ward,
1975).
The students spent on average NOK 1501 ($190) on gifts, which is 2.4% of what an
ordinary student got in loan and stipend from the state in 1997. This is similar to what
people elsewhere spend on Christmas gifts relative to income (Caplow, 1982). The giving of
gifts at Christmas may affirm the continued importance of social ties (Caplow, 1982), and
the giving of small presents seems to be a common means by which relationships may be
maintained (Bourdieu, 1976, cited by Cheal, 1987).
Kin
With exception of gifts to the student´s partner, we found that the most valuable gifts
were given to kin, as has been found elsewhere for gift giving in general (Befu, 1966;
Caplow, 1982; Cheal, 1986; Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1980; Saad and Gill, 2003). All
students gave to their parents, siblings, and children, most to their grandparents, and only a
third to at least some of their genetic aunts/uncles. A similar pattern was found for who in
the family gifts were received from, although some more students received gifts from
aunts/uncles than they gave to. Out of those students who could have given gifts to first
cousins, slightly above 20% gave, and none gave to second or third cousins (similarly for
received gifts), which is in accordance with what has been found elsewhere for cousins
(Caplow, 1982; Knutsen, 1987).
The closer the kin, the more often a gift was given. Together with some earlier
findings (Belk, 1979, cited by Fischer and Arnold 1990; Borch, 1994; Caplow, 1982; Saad
and Gill, 2003), it therefore seems that people of Western protestant cultures give to the
closest family (r = .5), most people give to grandparents (r = .25), fewer to genetic
aunts/uncles (r = .25), even fewer to first cousins (r = .125) and nobody to family with r <
.125. Our main result about gift-giving in relation to kinship is therefore in accordance with
what has been hypothesized from theory to be a universal feature (Daly et al., 1997, p. 282;
Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985; see also Buss, 1999, pp. 222-249; Cunningham, 1985;
Rossi and Rossi, 1990).
The students seemed to give as much to each of friends as to grandparents, genetic
uncles/aunts, and the remaining category "others". One here has to keep in mind that all

Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
"made" gifts are excluded from this analysis and that a lot of these gifts were to friends.
Number of friends the students gave to seemed to be relatively independent of how large
their extended family was (similar results by Dunbar and Spoors, 1995). The network of
friends may be maintained at the same time as economic expenditures are kept down by
exchanging small, relatively cheap or self-made gifts. Thus, friendship may not primarily be
maintained by gift giving but by other forms of mutual assistance, like help in daily life
(Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985).
Students with a partner spent less on gifts to mothers than those who had no partner.
When controlling for number of non-friends given to (mainly own and partner's family), the
association became weaker. Thus it seems that less money is spent on one's own mother
when their family in a wide sense increases. This may be to keep the total expenses down,
but also because less time is available per relation, and because the need for help from one's
mother may be reduced. Similar arguments may explain why older students tended to spend
less on gifts to brothers and sisters than younger students, namely to keep expenses down,
and because of reduced contact with siblings, and reduced need for family assistance.
Geographical distance
The closer the parents lived relative to the student, the more was spent on gifts to
them. Moreover, students talking often with their mother, spent more on gifts for her.
Distance was less important than other variables in explaining money spent on gifts to
mothers and fathers, and it was not significant for money spent on gifts to grandparents,
brothers and sisters. However, our findings fit with Cunningham's (1985) hypothesis that
humans have a tendency to become attached to those with whom they encounter most
frequently (see also Bowlby, 1969, 1973; Caplow, 1982; Rossi and Rossi, 1990). However,
gifts may also repair and reinforce the kinship ties when weakened by distance (Caplow,
1982; but see also Rossi and Rossi, 1990).
Gifts to partner and importance of civil status
We found that partners were the most likely of non-kin to give large gifts, which is in
accordance with earlier findings (Borch, 1994; Bussey, Banks, Darrington, Driscoll,
Goulding, Lowes, Phillips and Turner, 1967, cited by Carrier 1995; Caplow, 1982; Cheal,
1986; Essock-Vitale and McGuire, 1985). Gift giving can be an elaborate courtship ritual in
humans (Saad and Gill, 2003) and a way to avoid splitting up an important non-kin
relationship (Caplow, 1982).
We found that students with a partner had both more gift-giving and gift-receiving
relations than those without a partner, which is trivial (and also found by Borch, 1994)
because the former had more people (partner's family) to give to and to receive from.
Having a partner may diminish the generosity toward friends compared to being single
(Komter and Vollebergh, 1997). However, we found no effect of civil status on the number
of gift-giving relations to friends, as also found by Borch (1994).
Sex differences
We found that women gave to more people at Christmas than men, which was also
found in a Canadian study (Fischer and Arnold, 1990). On average, the women in our study
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 417 -
Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
gave to 13.6 persons, to their 12.5 persons, the men in ours study to 8.4 persons, their to 8.0
persons, which are very similar results. We also found that women spent more money on
gifts than men, even when controlling for number of gift-giving relations. To compare,
Borch (1998) found that women in her random Norwegian sample planned to spend less
money than men. However, Borch (1998) did not control for how many people in total they
planned to give to. In their study of assumed gift consumption among Canadian students,
Saad and Gill (2003) did not find any sex differences in total amount of money spent.
However, the study was about gifts in general, and it did not measure actual behavior, and
number of persons to which the students assumed to give, was not controlled for.
The extra gift-giving relations of women as compared to men were friends, which is
consistent with earlier findings (Argyle and Henderson, 1984; Borch, 1994; Essock-Vitale
and McGuire, 1985). Our results are consistent with the finding that women tend to maintain
a more complex network of intimate social relationships than men (Geary, 1998; Golombok
and Fivush, 1994, cited by Geary 1998; Turner, 1982). On average, women are more
motivated to develop and maintain a reciprocal and socially stable system of interpersonal
relationships with a relatively equal distribution of resources, whereas men are more
concerned with the establishment and maintenance of social dominance (Geary, 1998, p.
242). Women tend to maintain stronger emotional ties with their contacts than do men
(Booth, 1972), and feel more normative obligations to give gifts (Rossi and Rossi, 1990).
Male students in our sample did not seem to use gifts as a mean to gain social
dominance, which might have happened (competitive gift giving or giving to a large
network as a signal of wealth) according to Veblen's (1899) "conspicuous consumption"
hypothesis (see also Boone, 1998). However, this could hardly be expected in a relatively
poor student population. Moreover, in modern societies there exists a variety of means of
domination in which gifts may play little part (Cheal, 1988). We did not examine the sizes
of the social networks of men and women, so it might be argued that women gave to more
persons because they had a larger social network. This is probably not the case because
Dunbar and Spoors (1995) found that the modal network size was very similar for the two
sexes in a British sample. In addition, Hartup and Stevens (1997) concluded in their review
that sex differences in network size among adults were not consistent across the relevant
studies (see also Booth, 1972; Buys and Larson, 1979).
Why did our female students give to a larger network than male students? Geary
(1998, p. 248) argued that any such sex differences must be based on a consideration of the
social groups within which our female and male ancestors likely lived. Men, unlike other
male primates, tend to stay in their birth group and women tend to reside in the birth group
of their mate. Under such conditions, most men will have a social network of kin, whereas
most women will not. Because stable social relationships and social support are important
for the health and well-being of these women and their children, selection pressures may
have favored women who were skilled at developing and maintaining such relationships.
And because these relationships would be developed with non-kin, they would require
greater reciprocity and equity (Geary, 1998, p. 296). Relationships with friends probably
cannot be maintained without reciprocity and equity (Hartup and Stevens, 1997), and may
even require higher levels of exchange than relationships with kin (Essock-Vitale and
McGuire, 1985; Hartup and Stevens, 1997; Trivers, 1971). A larger network of gift relations
for women than men may also exist because of the larger female investment in the offspring,
causing a greater need for all kinds of support and protection for themselves and their
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 418 -
Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
offspring, including protection against men (Smuts, 1995). In humans, as in chimpanzees,
gorillas, and orangutans, female-female coalitions are relatively weak compared with those
formed in many female-bonded primates. This tends to be the case even when women do not
disperse from their natal groups (Rodseth, Smuts, Harrigan and Wrangham, 1991; Rodseth,
Wrangham, Harrigan, and Smuts, 1991).
Rucker et. al., (1991) found that males placed greater emphasis on price while
females were more concerned with how much both partners liked their gifts; when gift
exchange was between males and females, partners were less likely to report that the
exchange was equitable. In our study, women tended to give more to their partners than men
did, which is consistent with some other studies (Rucker et al., 1991; Saad and Gill, 2003).
However, the result is contrary to the prediction from evolutionary theory that men are
expected to give more than women (Buss, 1994), and also contrary to some empirical
findings (Borch, 1994; Caplow, 1982; Cheal, 1986; Janicki, 1999). Our results may reflect a
generally greater female involvement in gift giving (Cheal, 1988), and/or that women invest
more as a relationship stabilizes, while men invests most in the beginning as part of their
courtship strategy (Saad and Gill, 2003). Concerning the interaction effect for gifts to sisters,
it was interesting to note that with age, the investment curve for sisters leveled off faster for
men than for women. One explanation may be due to the finding that women both talked to
and met their sisters more than men did, even when controlling for age.
Because women invest more in a network of friends than men, it makes sense that it
was the female students who made gifts themselves in our study. This might be cheaper than
buying but also represents a more personal present. Apparently, the important thing is to
give a gift, not what is given or the expense of it, although some gifts may be judged as
inappropriate among friends, for example money (Burgoyne and Routh, 1991; Cheal, 1987,
1988; Lea et al., 1987; Solnick and Hemenway, 1996; Webley et al., 1983; Webley and
Wilson, 1989). We should also keep in mind that making of gifts is the old custom, which in
our modern society has been almost abandoned by adults (Bø, 1984, p. 172). Some decades
ago, most Norwegian women worked hard with finishing making of new clothes for
Christmas, whereas today it is the group with least purchasing power (children and
adolescents up to high school) who make the most gifts (Bø, 1984), as has also been found
elsewhere (Caplow, 1982). University students are a prolonged fork of this purchasing weak
group, and female students may follow the tradition from older female relatives more than
men.
Reciprocity
The primary distinction between the nature of social relationships among kin and
that among friends is reciprocity (Geary, 1998, p. 182). Relationships with kin, especially
parent-offspring relationships, are not always reciprocal, whereas long-term friendships are
defined by reciprocity (Hartup and Stevens, 1997; Trivers, 1974). Humans seem well
prepared to keep track of who reciprocates and who does not in various kinds of social
exchanges (e.g. Cosmides, 1989; Cosmides and Tooby, 1989, 1992; Gigerenzer and Hug,
1992).
In our study, the students gave gifts to equally as many as they received from, but the
persons given to and received from were not always the same, because 48% gave to one or
more people without getting anything in return, and 42% received gifts from one or more
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 419 -
Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
people without reciprocating. This would make the students inferior in this context,
particularly if the gifts were accepted with no thought of returning (Mauss, 1950/1990, p.
65). Gift exchanges at Christmas time is not expected to be delayed on part of either giver or
receiver, but to be performed simultaneously (Cheal, 1988, p. 22; Davis, 1992, p. 42).
However, if we consider which kind of people these non-reciprocal relationships were
about, it fits nicely with one of Essock-Vitale and McGuire's (1980) predictions that kin will
be given more unreciprocated help than non-kin. Most of the persons who did not return
gifts to the students were kin (genetic aunts/uncles, grandparents and first cousins), and most
of these transactions were from the older to the younger generation (i.e. the students got
presents from older people). Similarly, several students gave to children, who they did not
get anything in return from.
Only four students did not reciprocate with giving gifts to friends they received from,
and three to the family of cohabiting boy-/girlfriend. This fits nicely with Sahlins' (1965,
cited by Alexander 1975) review of the anthropological literature, that the closer the kinship
between the person giving the gift and the person receiving it, the less necessary it was that
the gift be balanced by a commensurate gift in return. Our results are also in accordance
with Essock-Vitale and McGuire's (1985) study of helping behavior in white, non-Hispanic,
middle-class, American women. They found higher degree of reciprocity balance among
both the women and their friends and among the women and their husbands/husbands' kin
than among the women and their own kin. Contrary to this, most of the persons the students
gave to without getting anything in return from, were friends.
The finding that the students gave to several persons who did not reciprocate and that
they gave more gifts than they received, fits recent research by Janicki (1998). She tested if
humans may have perceptual biases that function to take advantage of others (individual
selfishness) or that function to maximize a person's benefits and minimize costs within
reciprocal relationships (cooperative selfishness), and found convincing support for the
latter. Janicki (1998) argued that in order to maintain valuable reciprocal relationships in a
cooperative selfishness situation, individuals could be motivated to maintain their share of
reciprocating and to feel guilty if they do not. Reciprocating others seemed to be more
important than not being reciprocated and not reciprocating more upsetting than not being
reciprocated. One reasonable explanation is that not reciprocating can damage a relationship,
leading to the cessation of future benefits (Janicki, 1998). Another reasonable explanation is
that not reciprocating can damage one's reputation as an exchange partner (Alexander, 1987;
Janicki, 1998). Reciprocating others may also help avoiding indebtedness (Janicki, 1998).
The importance of giving more than one receives, thus acquiring a reputation of generosity,
has also been recognized by anthropologists (Carrier, 1987; Chiaramonte, 1970), and it does
not seem that people gain materially in the future in these exchanges.
Birth order
We found clear effects of birth order for several response variables, and birth order
was one of the most important predictor variables. Our results therefore support the general
thesis of Sulloway (1996), and research inspired by him (Davis, 1997; Hertwig et al., 2002;
Paulhus et al., 1999; Rohde et al., 2003; Salmon, 1998, 1999; Salmon and Daly, 1998), that
birth order seems to be an important parameter for determining personality. Firstborn
students spent more on average on each gift-giving relation than laterborn students, and
firstborns gave more to their parents, brothers (but not sisters) and grandparents than
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 4. 2006. - 420 -
Gift giving in modern Norwegian society
laterborns. This fits Sulloway's (1996) thesis that firstborns identify more strongly with
parents and with authority (including grandparents). This identification shapes their
personalities in formative early years, which seems to be reflected in their gift investments
later in life. In addition, firstborns were found to have more contact with their fathers than
laterborns, but lastborns had more contact with mothers than both first- and middleborns.
When controlling for how often the students met their mothers and fathers, firstborns still
gave more than laterborns.
Firstborns gave more even to brothers, which may at first seem conflicting, but it can
be due to firstborns being more family-centered (Salmon and Daly, 1998) and influenced by
kin ties (Salmon, 1998) than laterborns, especially middleborns. Note that consistent with
this middleborns actually met their parents least often. We also found that firstborns
received more from their brothers than laterborns, and can therefore not decide if they give
more because they receive more or vice versa (but these findings did not come from paired
tests). We have no good explanation as to why firstborns gave more to brothers, but not to
sisters (actually firstborns got more from sisters, but again, we could not use paired tests).
Perhaps it is due to our small sample size. A higher proportion of firstborns gave to relatives
outside the nuclear family and grandparents (namely to aunts), which might also be due to
firstborns being more family-centered and influenced by kin ties than laterborns (Salmon
1998; Salmon and Daly 1998). When controlling for number of male friends given to, it was
found that middleborns gave for more to each of their male friends than both firstborns and
lastborns. This fits with previous research (Salmon and Daly, 1998) where middleborns'
reduced closeness to parents (Kennedy, 1989) was made up by greater expressed closeness
to both unrelated friends and siblings. However, we did not find any birth-order effects for
gifts to female friends.
A higher proportion of middleborns preferred to let someone else buy/make at least
one of their gifts. Also in this respect, middleborns seem different (cf. Kennedy, 1989;
Rohde et al., 2003; Salmon and Daly, 1998; Sulloway, 1996). This might result because
middleborns are less family-centered (Salmon and Daly, 1998) or less influenced by kin ties
(Salmon, 1998) than both firstborns and lastborns, with less likelihood of indicating having a
close relationship with their parents (Kennedy, 1989): Christmas is a celebration with the
close family at its center, and middleborns may be less motivated to take part in the
celebration than first- and lastborns.
