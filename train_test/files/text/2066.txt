Rates of obesity have been steadily increasing, along with dis-
orders commonly associated with obesity, such as cardiovascular
disease and type II diabetes. Simultaneously, average sleep times
have progressively decreased. Recently, evidence from both
laboratory and epidemiologic studies has suggested that insuffi-
cient sleep may stimulate overeating and thus play a role in the
current epidemic of obesity and diabetes. In the human sleep
laboratory it is now possible to carefully control sleep behavior
and study the link between sleep duration and alterations in
circulating hormones involved in feeding behavior, glucose me-
tabolism, hunger, and appetite. This article focuses on the method-
ologies used in experimental protocols that have examined
modifications produced by sleep restriction (or extension) com-
pared with normal sleep. The findings provide evidence that sleep
restriction does indeed impair glucose metabolism and alters the
cross-talk between the periphery and the brain, favoring excessive
food intake. A better understanding of the adverse effects of sleep
restriction on the CNS control of hunger and appetite may have
important implications for public health.

The colloquia, "Medical Phenomena Susceptible to Quanti-
tative Approaches" encompassed various areas of research
that showed that it is indeed possible to rigorously manipulate
human behavior and measure valuable stringent outcomes.
Within the context of this volume on the "Quantification of
Behavior," the present article focuses on methods that have been
used to manipulate human sleep duration and quality in the
laboratory while examining the consequences on hormones,
metabolism, and the control of food intake. We first briefly in-
troduce the epidemiologic evidence in support of a link between
sleep disturbances and an increased risk of obesity and diabetes.
After this introduction, we provide some basic background in-
formation regarding the CNS control of eating behavior for
readers of this volume who do not focus on this area of inquiry.
Last, we describe the combination of quantitative methods that
have been used in well-controlled laboratory studies of the im-
pact of sleep restriction on the risks of obesity and diabetes.
Epidemiologic Evidence for a Link Between Sleep Disturbances
and the Risk of Obesity and Diabetes
It is well established that the prevalence of overweight and
obesity has steadily increased worldwide in recent years, with
particularly alarming acceleration in the last 2 decades in the
United States (1). In America, all race, sex, age, and socioeco-
nomic groups have been affected by this epidemic. According to
data collected by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in
1985 no participating states had obesity rates greater than 15%.
By 1999, 18 states reported obesity rates of 20­24% of their
population, and not a single state had obesity rates under 10%.
Most concerning is that these rates have continued to increase;
in 2009 only one state had obesity rates lower than 20%, whereas
nine states reported a prevalence of obesity $30% of the state's
population. Along with the rise in the prevalence of obesity,
disorders commonly associated with obesity, such as cardiovas-
cular disease and type II diabetes, have concurrently increased.
Considering that obesity is associated with adverse health out-
comes, elucidating potential contributing factors to the epidemic
of obesity may have important implications for public health.
Traditional explanations for the increase in the prevalence of
overweight and obesity have focused on portion size, wide avail-
ability of inexpensive high-calorie/high-fat foods, and decreased
physical activity. Experts recognize that these traditional explan-
ations do not fully explain the epidemic. In recent years, other
putative causal mechanisms have begun to emerge, including
chronic partial sleep loss and poor sleep quality.
As the incidence of obesity has increased, average sleep times
have indeed decreased. Polls conducted by the CDC and the
National Sleep Foundation (NSF), as well as large-scale epide-
miological studies, have indicated that Americans may be
chronically sleep deprived because of voluntary bedtime cur-
tailment (2­4). In 1959­1960, a study conducted by the Ameri-
can Cancer Society found that the majority of respondents
reported sleeping 8­8.9 h per night (5). Later in the 1960s, some
studies were beginning to reveal reductions in average self-
reported sleep times to 7­8 h per night (6­8). Self-reported sleep
times have continued to decline, as evidenced by the 2008 NSF
poll in which adults reported sleeping 6 h 40 min on weeknights
(4, 9). The most recent NSF poll detailed average self-reported
sleep times across racial groups; all groups reported sleep times
less than 7 h per weeknight, with whites reporting on average 6 h
52 min, African Americans 6 h 14 min, Asians 6 h 48 min, and
Hispanics 6 h 34 min (9). Fig. 1 illustrates the intriguing finding
that already in 1965 a larger proportion of short sleepers was
found among African Americans, a population at increased risk
for cardio-metabolic disease. Further, the proportion of short
sleepers in this high-risk population and in Hispanics, an ethnic
group with a higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes, has been
increasing faster than in whites from 1965 to 1999 (10).
Interestingly, when measured objectively, sleep times may be
lower than estimated with self-reports. A study conducted be-
tween 1990 and 1994 found that participants slept on average
6.2 h per night, as measured with wrist actigraphy (11). Recently,
in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults
Sleep Study (2000­2006), sleep duration derived from several
days of wrist actigraphy averaged 6.1 h per night (12), whereas

self-reported sleep averaged 6.7 h per weeknight and 7.3 h per
weekend night (13). Declines in sleep time can be attributed, in
part, to extended work schedules including shift work, long com-
muting times, stressful lifestyles, modern conveniences such
as 24-h television and computer/Internet use, and social and
leisure activities.
There is a growing body of evidence suggesting a link between
insufficient sleep duration and increased risk of obesity and type
II diabetes. The epidemiological evidence for an association
between short sleep and elevated body mass index (BMI) has
previously been reviewed (14, 15) and established that the ma-
jority of both cross-sectional and prospective studies, whether in
children or adults, had positive findings relating short sleep to
increased obesity risk after controlling for multiple confounders.
Importantly, the increased risk of obesity that may be attribut-
able to insufficient sleep seems to be larger in children than in
adults (15). Nonetheless, the relationship between short sleep
and elevated BMI persists in both older men and women, as
demonstrated in a large study that used actigraphy to assess sleep
duration in more than 6,000 adults aged 67­99 y (16). There is
also strong epidemiologic evidence for a link between short sleep
and an increased risk of type II diabetes. Among prospective
studies (which provide some indication regarding direction of
causality), seven of nine studies examining the incidence of di-
abetes in short sleepers found a significantly elevated risk. A
recent meta-analysis combining data from 90,623 individuals
concluded that for short sleep duration (#5­6 h per night), the
relative risk of developing diabetes was 1.28 after controlling for
multiple factors (17). Not included in this meta-analysis is the
largest study to date (18), which included 174,542 adults and
observed that individuals who report sleeping <5 h per night,
relative to those reporting 7­8 h per night, had a 46% higher risk
of developing type II diabetes, after controlling for multiple
confounders, including adiposity.
Despite this increasing body of epidemiologic evidence, the
mechanistic pathways linking sleep restriction with appetite
dysregulation, increased food intake, and impaired glucose me-
tabolism remain poorly understood.
Mechanistic Pathways Linking Central and Peripheral
Control of Metabolism and Energy Balance
There are a plethora of mechanisms and redundancies within the
CNS and periphery that work in concert to regulate feeding be-
havior and energy expenditure. Interestingly, despite the re-
dundancy of these systems, alterations in a single neuroregulatory
pathway can lead to modifications in food intake and energy ex-
penditure (19). For the purpose of this article, we focus on a few
circulating molecular signals that influence these outcomes.
A potential mechanism of action between chronic partial sleep
loss and alterations in appetite regulation and metabolism may
lie within the hypothalamus and/or within hypothalamic com-
munication with peripheral systems. Hypothalamic nuclei have
a well-established role in modulating energy homeostasis and
feeding regulation; lesions of ventromedial, paraventricular, and
dorsomedial nuclei or stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus
(LH) produce hyperphagia, whereas lesions of the LH inhibit
feeding (20). More specifically, the arcuate nucleus (Arc) lies
close to the third ventricle; thus, circulating satiety and/or hunger
signals, including those secreted from fat tissue, pancreas, and
the gut, easily interact with this nucleus. Arc neurons produce
and respond to neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti-related protein
(AgRP), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and cocaine- and am-
phetamine-regulated transcript (CART) to influence feeding
behavior and energy homeostasis (21, 22). In fact, discrete acti-
vation of these Arc neurons can facilitate alterations in behavior
and energy expenditure; excitation of NPY/AgRP neurons
increases food intake and decreases energy expenditure, and
stimulation of POMC/CART receptors inhibits food intake and
increases energy expenditure (20, 23). Thus, some peripherally
secreted substrates modulate feeding and energy expenditure via
direct action on these cells within the Arc. Moreover, cells within
the Arc directly project to the LH, which in turn projects to
thalamo-cortical systems, central autonomic effectors, and motor
pattern generators that influence regulation of feeding (24).
Thus, the Arc, LH, and the substrates that modulate these nuclei
are primary candidates of study when examining the effect of
sleep restriction on metabolic systems but are normally not ac-
cessible to experimental assessment in humans.
There are multiple peptides and hormones that are important
in the regulation of metabolism and energy balance and act on
these hypothalamic nuclei, including those originating from fat
tissue (such as leptin and adiponectin) and the gut (such as
ghrelin, peptide YY, pancreatic polypeptide, and cholecystoki-
nin). Although the main source of these molecules resides in the
periphery, they are also present in the CNS. Studies that exam-
ined the impact of sleep disturbances on energy balance have
mostly focused on leptin and ghrelin, and we will therefore limit
our brief review to these two pivotal players. Leptin, discovered
in 1994, is one such peptide hormone encoded by the obesity
gene (ob) that is secreted by white adipose tissue into the cir-
culatory system (25). Leptin is thought to be an index of energy
sufficiency (23). It is hypothesized that a decrease in leptin levels
may be a critical signal to the CNS, indicating a state of depleted
energy stores in which appetite should increase and energy ex-
penditure decrease, favoring survival. Simply put, it influences
feeding behavior and energy expenditure via leptin receptors
that are most abundantly found in the arcuate, ventromedial, and
dorsomedial nuclei of the hypothalamus (26) as well as other
extrahypothalamic CNS sites, and peripheral tissues (although
less is known about the mechanism of action in these areas) (22,
26). Within the Arc, leptin directly activates, via depolarization,
hypothalamic POMC/CART neurons and in contrast, inhibits
(hyperpolarizes) NPY/AgRP hypothalamic neurons (21, 27).
Interestingly, within the Arc, 40% of POMC neurons express the
long form of the leptin receptor (28). Thus, one mechanism by
which leptin mediates energy homeostasis is via its action on

baseline was calculated across categories for each covariate, including fre-
quency, prevalence, and odds ratio. A generalized estimating equation ap-
proach for statistical testing with regard to short sleep, race/ethnic group,
income, and education was used owing to the repeated nature of the data
(10). African Americans (P < 0.0001) and Hispanics (P < 0.001) showed sig-
nificantly greater increase over time in the prevalence of short sleep dura-
tion compared with whites. (Reprinted from ref. 10, Copyright 2007, with

orexigenic NPY/AgRP and anorexigenic POMC/CART neurons
within the hypothalamus. Regarding appetite regulation, indi-
viduals lacking leptin or the leptin receptor become obese (29),
and leptin replacement therapy has been shown to alleviate
obesity in some subjects (30). However, in obesity that is not
related to a genetic defect in the leptin system, peripheral leptin
levels are increased rather than decreased, indicating central
resistance to leptin signaling in obesity (31). In normal-weight
individuals, plasma leptin levels increase immediately after food
intake and decrease in response to food deprivation (32­34).
Interestingly, recent data have suggested that leptin may also
play a role in modulating glucose metabolism, independent of
its effects on energy balance (19). For instance, leptin adminis-
tration to leptin-deficient mice and humans improves hyper-
insulinemia and hyperglycemia, even during controlled food
intake paradigms (35­37).
Contrasting with the role of leptin as a peripheral signal for
satiety, ghrelin, a hormone produced by endocrine cells within
the stomach, plays a role in stimulating appetite, as well as pro-
moting effective storage of consumed food; ghrelin has been
described as a signal of energy insufficiency (29). One mecha-
nism by which ghrelin exerts these effects is via pathways that
partly overlap leptin-sensitive pathways (23). For instance, NPY/
AgRP cells within the Arc express ghrelin receptors, and ghrelin
activates these neurons; ghrelin depolarizes NPY/AgRP neurons
while simultaneously increasing inhibitory input to POMC/
CART neurons (23, 38). With respect to appetite regulation, in
humans there is a premeal rise in plasma ghrelin, suggesting a
role for ghrelin in meal initiation (39). It is apparent that ghrelin
is involved in mediating energy homeostasis via feeding regula-
tion; however, the exact mechanism of ghrelin action is still
unclear. The acylation of ghrelin is necessary for some, but not
all, of its endocrine actions. Nonacylated ghrelin circulates in
much larger amounts than acylated ghrelin and may have distinct,
and perhaps antagonistic, metabolic effects.
Appetite regulation and energy homeostasis are also under the
control of insulin. Insulin receptors are expressed in many areas
of the body, including of course liver, muscle, and fat, but,
according to most but not all studies, are also present in the CNS
(40). Similar to leptin, insulin receptors are located within the

Arc of the hypothalamus and may activate similar pathways (i.e.,
inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons) (21). Intracerebroventricular in-
fusion of insulin decreases NPY mRNA in the Arc, and insulin-
deficient rats show increased hypothalamic mRNA expression
(41­43). Further, recent studies have shown that leptin and in-
sulin both act on POMC neurons, although within distinct sub-
populations within the Arc (44). Regarding food intake spe-
cifically, intraventricular infusions of insulin reduce food intake
and body weight (29). As body weight increases, basal levels of
insulin and insulin levels in response to a meal increase in an
attempt to maintain normal glucose homeostasis.
Sleep deprivation affects glucose metabolism through multiple
pathways. The brain uses as much as 50% of total glucose uti-
lization in the fasting state (20% in the fed state), which is 10
times more than predicted on a mass basis. Imaging studies have
shown that the sleep-deprived brain uses 7­8% less glucose than
the well-rested brain. A limitation of these imaging studies is that
they have been conducted under conditions of total sleep dep-
rivation. Thus, the impact of recurrent partial sleep restriction,
a much more common condition, on brain glucose metabolism
remains to be elucidated. Another major pathway linking sleep
loss and peripheral function is the autonomous nervous system.
Alterations of cardiac sympatho-vagal balance, with higher sym-
pathetic nervous activity and lower vagal tone, have been docu-
mented in a number of studies of human sleep loss, including
studies of partial sleep restriction (45). Whether similar alter-
ations of autonomic nervous system control in conditions of sleep
loss occur at multiple organ levels is not known. A few studies
have shown that norepinephrine levels are elevated during sleep
deprivation (46) and in individuals suffering from obstructive sleep
apnea (47). Peripheral organs that play a major role in glucose
regulation and are strongly affected by sympathetic activity in-
clude the liver, pancreas, adipose tissue, and the gastrointestinal
tract. Sleep loss also dysregulates counter-regulatory hormones in
a manner consistent with the promotion of hyperglycemia and/or
insulin resistance. Indeed, elevations of evening cortisol levels
(48­51), increased release of growth hormone and ghrelin during
daytime hours (52­54), and elevated daytime levels of epinephrine
(55) have all been observed under sleep debt conditions.
Orexins A and B, two peptides that are synthesized by neurons
concentrated in the LH, constitute a molecular link between
sleep­wake regulation and the neuroendocrine control of ap-
petite. Orexin-containing neurons play a central role in the main-
tenance of arousal. There is evidence that orexins may stimulate
food intake, particularly the early part of the usual sleep period,
which is when voluntary sleep deprivation most often occurs in
humans (56, 57). Feeding requires the maintenance of wakeful-
ness, and the orexin system seems to play a central role in this
interaction between feeding and arousal (58). Orexin-containing
neurons are active during waking and quiescent during sleep.
Deficiencies in the orexin system are associated with sleep dis-
orders that involve chronic excessive daytime sleepiness, in-
cluding narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea. In contrast,
when sleep deprivation is enforced behaviorally, the orexin sys-
tem is overactive, most likely to maintain wakefulness against the
increased sleep pressure (59­61). The orexin system activates the
appetite-promoting NPY neurons in the Arc (62). Orexinergic
activity is in turn influenced by both central and peripheral sig-
nals, with glucose and leptin exerting inhibitory effects, whereas
ghrelin promotes further activation. Furthermore, orexin neurons
have dense projections to the dopaminergic ventrotegmental area
and nucleus accumbens, which are involved in the hedonic control
of food intake, and thus orexin may serve as an interface between
metabolic and motivational systems with motor outputs to
modulate food intake (58). A profound impact of sleep loss on
appetite regulation should therefore be expected when consid-
ering the associations of these systems. Although peripheral
levels of circulating orexin may not be representative of central
orexinergic activity, they would nonetheless be an interesting
exploratory outcome measure in studies involving manipulations
of sleep behavior. Of note, in a 2005 study from Japan, plasma
orexin levels were found to decrease with the severity of ob-
structive sleep apnea and to increase after treatment with con-
tinuous positive airway pressure (63), suggesting that peripheral
orexin levels may track daytime alertness.
Some of the alterations that have been observed in conditions
of sleep loss, such as elevated sympatho-adrenal activity should
be associated with increased, rather than decreased, energy ex-
penditure. Although extreme sleep deprivation in rodent models
results in weight loss despite increased caloric intake, this does
not seem to be the case in humans, in whom the stimulation of
food intake seems to be excessive in relation to the energy
demands of extended wakefulness under comfortable sedentary
conditions. A recent study quantified the caloric requirement of

staying awake vs. sleeping in healthy young adults and found that
the energy cost of a night of total sleep deprivation averaged
a modest 134 calories (64). The large body of epidemiologic
evidence linking short sleep duration and obesity suggests that in
humans, the increase in energy intake resulting from sleep re-
striction exceeds the modest increase in energy needed to sustain
extended wakefulness.
Quantitative Methods to Assess the Impact of Bedtime
Restriction on the Cross-Talk Between Brain and Peripheral
Metabolism
Laboratory studies in human volunteers are generally limited by
a relatively small sample size (10­20 subjects) but have the ad-
vantage of rigorously imposing different sleep conditions (nor-
mal bedtimes, restricted bedtimes, and extended bedtimes) and
allowing for a multi-level assessment of components of energy
balance and glucose metabolism. A few studies involving ex-
perimental manipulation of sleep quality without change in sleep
duration have also been conducted (65, 66). Typically, the par-
ticipants are young healthy lean volunteers, caloric intake is
rigorously controlled, and sedentary conditions are enforced to
control for activity levels. Each sleep condition involves 2­15 d,
with stringently controlled bedtimes and light­dark cycles. In our
laboratory the center of the bedtime period is kept constant, and
light exposure is reduced in the evening and morning to avoid a
shift of circadian phase. Within-subject comparisons can be made
between conditions; therefore, any alterations observed are most
likely due to the experimental intervention instead of other con-
founding factor(s). Moreover, the amount of sleep (hours per
night and length of restriction) can be carefully managed in the
laboratory setting; sleep is recorded nightly by polysomnography.
During each sleep condition, participants complete questionnaires
about mood, subjective sleepiness, alertness, hunger, and appetite
multiple times per day. Each sleep condition involves at least one
24-h period when blood is frequently sampled, which allows for
profiles of circulating peptides including leptin, ghrelin, glucose,
insulin, and C-peptide (a marker of insulin secretion), cortisol, and
growth hormone. Intravenous glucose tolerance tests (ivGTT) are
conducted to examine glucose tolerance (kg, rate of decrease of
glucose levels after glucose injection), glucose effectiveness (Sg,
a marker of non­insulin-dependent glucose utilization and there-
fore an indirect measure of brain glucose metabolism), insulin
sensitivity (SI, which quantifies the amount of insulin needed to
metabolize a given amount of glucose), acute insulin response to
glucose (AIRg, the acute insulin response to glucose in the first 20
min after glucose injection), and the disposition index (a validated
marker of diabetes risk; DI = SI × AIRg). The response to oral
glucose, which involves the gastrointestinal tract and the so-called
incretin effect, may be assessed on a separate day.
Although these studies allow for thorough evaluation of alter-
ations produced by sleep restriction, translating these results to
real-life conditions is not straightforward. Indeed, laboratory

change in hunger ratings and the ghrelin/leptin ratio were calculated using the Spearman rank test. Values were calculated using data from 4 h in bed minus
the value obtained after 10 h in bed. The calculated value was negative when the variable measured after 10 h in bed was higher than that measured after 4 h
in bed. Lower: Mean (±SEM) 24-h plasma leptin profiles obtained from nine healthy lean men studied at bed rest who ate three identical carbohydrate-rich

repeated measures. Time spent asleep in each condition was as follows; 3 h 48 min in 4-h bedtime condition, 6 h 52 min in 8-h bed condition, and 8 h 52 min in
the 12-h condition. Note that the characteristics of the 24-h leptin profile (amplitude, nocturnal maximum, and overall mean) increased from the 4-h to the
12-h bedtime condition. Dark bars denote sleep periods.

studies of sleep restriction are generally limited in duration and
thus may not fully mimic changes in appetite and metabolism
produced by more chronic partial sleep loss. The stress of sleep
loss under the demands of normal life conditions, including pro-
fessional and social demands, is also not replicated by laboratory
conditions. Furthermore, although cross-sectional and pro-
spective studies have reported associations between shortened
sleep duration and increased weight irrespective of sex differ-
ences, the vast majority of laboratory studies in both humans
and animals have only been conducted on males. Thus, further
examination of potential sex differences with regard to this re-
lationship is necessary.
In the remainder of this article, we summarize the methodology
and findings of three laboratory studies examining the metabolic
impact of reduced sleep duration or quality. The protocol design
of each study is schematically illustrated in Fig. 2 A­C.
Methodology and Findings of Previous Laboratory Studies
The first controlled study to examine the effect of sleep re-
striction on metabolic and endocrine function involved 11
healthy young men who were allowed 8 h in bed for three nights
(baseline), restricted to 4 h in bed for six nights (sleep debt),
followed by 12 h in bed for seven nights (sleep recovery) (49).
The protocol is shown in Fig. 2A. During the last 2 d of each
experimental condition, the participants were given identical
carbohydrate-rich meals and were subjected to bed rest while an
ivGTT was conducted, followed by a 24-h period of frequent
blood sampling. Sleep restriction was successful in that the mean
total sleep time during the period of sleep debt was 3 h and 49
min in comparison with the 9 h and 3 min attained during the
period of sleep recovery. The proportion of slow-wave sleep
[stages III and IV of non-REM (rapid eye movement) sleep] was
higher during the sleep-debt conditions in comparison with
baseline and sleep recovery, revealing an increased pressure for
slow-wave sleep. However, the state of sleep debt was primarily
characterized by a loss of REM sleep, which was reduced from
z90 min at baseline to 40 min during the last two short nights.
After the period of sleep restriction, glucose and insulin responses
to the ivGTT and breakfast were consistent with an impairment
of carbohydrate tolerance consistent with a prediabetic state. As
illustrated in Fig. 3 (Upper), the ivGTT revealed 40% lower glu-
cose clearance, a 25­30% reduction in glucose effectiveness and
in insulin sensitivity, and a disposition index 40% lower in the
sleep-restricted than in the sleep-extension condition (49, 67).
Findings of decreased insulin sensitivity without adequate com-
pensation by increased insulin release have been replicated in
other studies of sleep restriction (55, 68). In the initial "sleep debt
study," postbreakfast homeostatic model assessment values (a
marker of insulin resistance) increased 56% in the sleep-debt
condition compared with sleep extension, owing to elevated glu-
cose levels in response to breakfast despite the fact that insulin
levels also tended to be higher. Evening cortisol and sympathetic
nervous system activation were increased; both are risk factors for
the development of insulin resistance and obesity. The 24-h
profile of blood constituents revealed that leptin levels are par-
ticularly sensitive to sleep duration (45), confirming an early re-
port (69). Mean leptin levels were 19% lower in the sleep-debt vs.
sleep-extension condition and intermediate with 8-h bedtimes
(Fig. 4, Lower). Further, both the nocturnal acrophase and am-
plitude of the diurnal variation of leptin were decreased (26%
and 20%, respectively). Interestingly, these changes occurred
despite similar caloric intake, activity, and without changes in
BMI (45). These observed leptin concentrations are somewhat
larger than those observed in young adults after 3 d of dietary
restriction by z900 kcal/d (70). Thus, not only does sleep debt
alter metabolic systems promoting diabetes risk, but leptin seems
to be signaling a state of caloric deficit during the period of sleep
debt, potentially leading to hyperphagia.
In a subsequent randomized cross-over study (Fig. 2B), de-
veloped in part to control for putative order effects in the "sleep
debt" study, metabolic parameters were examined after two
nights of either 4 or 10 h in bed (54). Hormonal findings perti-
nent to appetite regulation are illustrated in Fig. 4 (Upper).
Consistent with the seminal study, sleep restriction was associ-
ated with decreased leptin concentration, even though meals
were replaced by constant glucose infusion. Furthermore, this
study revealed a concomitant increase in the orexigenic factor
ghrelin (24%), along with increased hunger and appetite ratings
(24% and 23%, respectively) in the short-sleep condition com-
pared with the well-rested condition (54). Interestingly, appetite
ratings tended to be greatest for carbohydrate-rich, calorie-dense
foods. The change in the ghrelin/leptin ratio between the two
experimental conditions was significantly and positively corre-
lated with changes in hunger ratings, suggesting that sleep re-
striction-induced alterations in these hormones may, in part, be
driving observed increases in hunger ratings. These results are
consistent with findings from two population-based studies that
have also reported associations between short sleep duration,
leptin, and ghrelin levels consistent with an up-regulation of ap-
petite (71, 72). Moreover, these associations were independent
of BMI and other possible confounding factors. Thus, sleep re-
striction or partial chronic sleep loss produces modifications in the
profile of appetite-regulating hormones, favoring hyperphagia.
In a more recent study of the metabolic impact of experi-
mental reductions of sleep quality (65), suppression of slow-wave
activity (non-REM stages III and IV) was accomplished without
altering total sleep time for three consecutive nights (Fig. 2C). A
control condition of normal undisturbed sleep with 8.5 h in bed
was presented in a randomized cross-over design. As summa-
rized in Fig. 3 (Lower), metabolic alterations qualitatively similar
to those observed after reductions in sleep duration emerged
(65). In this study, slow-wave suppression was achieved with
acoustic stimulation; as soon as slow-waves were identified on
the EEG recording, a sound was sent to amplifiers on both sides
of the subject's bed to elicit a microarousal and subsequent
suppression of slow-wave activity. This resulted in an increase in
the lighter sleep stages, stages I and II, without changing total
sleep time or the amount of REM sleep. After three nights of
slow-wave sleep suppression, insulin sensitivity, glucose toler-
ance, and the disposition index decreased compared with base-
line (by 25%, 23%, and 20%, respectively). These values are
typical of individuals who have impaired glucose tolerance and
are at risk for developing frank diabetes. Notably, the magnitude
of the changes for both insulin sensitivity and acute insulin re-
sponse to glucose were correlated with the decreases in slow-
wave sleep (65). Similar to the previous studies, elevated cardiac
sympathetic nervous activity was apparent after 3 d of slow-wave
suppression. Selective suppression of slow-wave activity thus
produces clear reductions in glucose tolerance and increases in
markers of diabetes risk. Therefore, it seems that not only the
duration of sleep but also the quality of sleep is important for
metabolic function. Consistent with this notion, an independent
study of sleep fragmentation across all stages (which, however,
led to a greater decrease of slow-wave sleep than of other sleep
stages) obtained similar findings as in the study of selective sleep
suppression (66). Considering that there are marked age-related
changes in sleep quality, particularly reductions in slow-wave
activity, it is possible that the sleep disturbances of normal aging
may also play a role in the increased diabetes risk in older
populations. In contrast, a current ongoing clinical trial may
offer interesting insight into the association between sleep du-
ration and BMI. The authors are examining whether extending
sleep duration and/or quality may positively affect body weight
(i.e., decrease in overweight individuals), although findings have
yet to be reported (73).

Conclusions
As rates of overweight and obesity continue to increase, chronic
partial sleep loss and poor sleep quality have also become en-
demic conditions. A growing body of epidemiologic and labora-
tory evidence suggests that the behavior of bedtime curtailment
may be contributing to the epidemics of obesity and type II di-
abetes. Whereas epidemiologic studies have revealed an associ-
ation between short sleep times and increased BMI and increased
diabetes risk, controlled laboratory studies are able to demon-
strate a causal relationship between bedtime restriction and met-
abolic alterations. Sleep restriction leads to increases in hunger and
appetite ratings, along with modifications in hormonal profiles--
lower leptin and higher ghrelin levels--that favor hyperphagia.
Moreover, a state of sleep debt causes disturbances in glucose
regulation, potentially leading to increased risk for developing
type II diabetes. Similarly, experimental reduction of sleep quality
without change of sleep duration has also been shown to be as-
sociated with impairment of glucose tolerance. These findings
have important implications for public health and well being.
Increased awareness of the deleterious effects of chronic partial
sleep loss and poor sleep quality may be important in regulating
the prevalence of overweight, obesity, and associated adverse
health outcomes.
