Abstract
This research examines how the media report on sentences given to those who commit serious
crimes against children and how this impacts on public knowledge and attitudes. Three months
of press and television coverage were analysed in order to establish the editorial lines that are
taken in different sections of the media and how they are promoted by selective reporting of
sentencing. Results indicate that a small number of very high profile crimes account for a significant
proportion of reporting in this area and often, particularly in the tabloid press, important
information regarding sentencing rationale is sidelined in favour of moral condemnation and
criticism of the judiciary. Polling data indicate that public attitudes are highly critical of sentencing
but also confused about the meaning of tariffs. The article concludes by discussing what can be
done to promote a more informed public debate over penal policy in this area.

on serious crimes against children.1 These crimes have attracted a great deal of media
attention and have been highlighted as an area of major public concern. In order to
address these issues, we have analysed both media reporting and public views on sen-
tencing policy. The importance of this research is that it demonstrates how the mass
media, and in particular the tabloid press, can promote specific ways of understanding
sentencing policy and the appropriateness of sentences given to offenders. Politicians
may then respond to these perceived climates of opinion or may attempt to harness them
for electoral advantage. However, this can create a situation where criminal policy is
influenced by what plays well with particular sections of the media, rather than being
based on rigorous research evidence.
We will initially review the research literature on public attitudes towards sentencing
and the influence of the mass media in this area. We will then examine data which sug-
gest that since the mid-1990s, sentencing policy has moved in a punitive direction as
politicians have substituted evidence-based policy for measures orientated towards
media-driven climates of opinion. We will focus specifically on high profile crimes
against children and will address three analytical research questions:
· What are the editorial lines that are being taken in media accounts of these crimes?
· How are these promoted by selective reporting of particular crimes and types of
sentences?
· What is the impact of this reporting on public understanding and attitudes?
The Existing Debate
A body of research conducted over decades has found that most people see the sen-
tences handed down by judges as being too lenient (see Cullen et al., 2000; Roberts,
1992). However research also suggests that public perceptions of sentencing leniency
may be a function of both widespread ignorance and misconceptions concerning the
operation of the judicial system. Studies have consistently pointed to low levels of
public knowledge in relation to the criminal justice system. In a MORI (2003) poll
49 per cent of respondents admitted that they knew `not very much', `hardly anything'
or `nothing at all' about the court system in Britain. Most people also have little knowl-
edge about sentencing guidelines, maximum penalties or the range of punishments that
courts can impose (Hough, 1996). Public ignorance and confusion over sentencing may
be partly a consequence of the complexity of the legal system. However distortions in
public perceptions are not random but instead follow a particular pattern in that respond-
ents consistently underestimate the punitiveness of the sentencing system. Public esti-
mates of imprisonment rates for various offences are significantly lower than actual
rates (Doob and Roberts, 1983; Hough and Roberts, 1999; Mattinson and Mirrelees-
Black, 2000). Furthermore the public tends to underestimate the lengths of sentences
that courts hand down for specific crimes (Hough and Roberts, 1998; Paulin et al.,
2003) and to assume that most of a sentence will be spent in the community without real
supervision (Hough and Roberts, 1999).
Research in this area also suggests that perceptions of sentencing leniency may be an
artefact of the survey method used in public opinion polls. North American studies have
Berry et al. 569
found that attempting to gauge public attitudes using general poll questions may be
problematic for three reasons (Brillon et al., 1984; Doob and Roberts, 1988; Roberts and
Stalans, 1997; Sprott, 1996). First, there is evidence people responding to general poll
questions tend to answer punitively because they have the worst offenders in mind.
Second, when judging sentencing policy, respondents tend to recall unusually lenient
sentences that are heavily reported in the media. Third, respondents typically do not
consider the full range of sentencing options available to courts. These arguments were
supported in a British study where participants were asked to attach sentences to an
offender in a specific burglary case (Hough and Roberts, 1999). In the study the respond-
ents were given background information to the offence which was available to the court
but which is usually absent from media accounts. The research found that ordinary
members of the public were no more punitive than the courts would have been in a
similar situation.
All of this research evidence points to the key role of the mass media in influencing public
knowledge and attitudes. Hough and Roberts (1999: 23) argue that the media, and in particu-
lar the tabloid press, exert influence through the selection and framing of stories and the
strong criticism of instances where allegedly lenient punishments have been handed down:
People do not receive balanced information about sentencing practices in the news media, but
rather a steady stream of stories about sentencing malpractices, cases in which a judge imposes
what appears to be a very lenient sentence for a serious crime of violence. Quantitative analysis
of press coverage does not actually suggest that newspapers are more likely to cover stories
about court cases if the sentence is a light one; however, when lenient sentences are passed, the
attention given to them, and the editorial comment on them, tend to be shrill. In such cases, the
news media rarely make any attempts to explain the judicial reasoning underlying the decision,
or to place the sentence imposed in some statistical context.
Others researchers point to the significance of the volume of crime reporting and how
this may influence opinion. Roberts et al. (2002) argue that the way that the media
feature crime, and particularly serious violent crime, makes it appear more prevalent
than it is in reality and that this is mirrored in public overestimations both of the preva-
lence of this kind of crime and their chances of victimization. Others suggest the news
media's tendency to frame crime episodically as discrete individual actions, as opposed
to arising out of wider social processes, may engender individualistic attitudes towards
crime control which focus primarily on punitive sanctions against offenders (Iyengar,
1991). These effects may be reinforced by the presentation of crime in television reality
shows (Roberts et al., 2002) and fictional representations such as crime dramas (Beckett
and Sasson, 2000; Fabianic, 1997) both of which tend to present a robust policing
solution to the problem of crime. Research evidence which directly links use of media
to attitudes about crime and sentencing is relatively scarce and since much of it is cor-
relational it suffers from the problem of trying to establish directionality. However,
Indemaur and Roberts (2005: 61) note that `generally an association can be observed
between a shallow or limited perception of crime trends, use of commercial, broadcast or
tabloid media and increased punitiveness' though `whether or not all these variables are
in turn related to another more relevant variable such as education level, socio-economic
status or even intelligence is yet to be established'.
570 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
The research evidence therefore suggests that public opinion is more complicated
than the consistently punitive picture which emerges from decades of raw opinion polls.
When presented with information available to judges or jurors, public opinion appears no
more punitive than sentencers. Part of the reason why public opinion appears so punitive
in polls is that it rests on ignorance and misunderstanding about the operation of the
criminal justice system. This low and distorted level of public knowledge is closely
related to the reporting of crime, particularly in the tabloid press, where little context and
much negative editorial comment is attached to sentencing decisions.
However, despite the evidence that raw opinion data is an unreliable barometer
of public opinion, there is evidence that it have increasingly become influential in set-
ting policy debates. This trend which has been dubbed `penal populism' has seen politi-
cians substitute evidence-based policy for measures designed to satisfy the supposed
public desire for harsher penalties (Garland, 2001; Hough and Roberts, 1999; Pratt et al.,
2005; Roberts et al., 2002). Part of the rationale for this has been that it would restore
public confidence in the judicial system (Henham, 1997). Roberts et al. (2002) trace the
beginning of this shift in England and Wales to the appointment of Michael Howard as
Home Secretary in 1993 and his imposition of the `prison works' programme. Howard
`successfully mined a broad seam of public opinion that supported harsher sentencing'
and increased the prison population by 50 per cent in four years (Roberts et al., 2002:
46). Part of the reason for the Conservative Party's decision to move penal policy in a
more authoritarian direction was that it felt it had to compete with a Labour Party which
was attempting to establish itself as being the party toughest on crime. As Green (2006:
138) notes Labour `did this in part by fitting its rhetoric to tabloid sensibilities'. Tony
Blair hired Alastair Campbell, the former political editor of the Daily Mirror. Campbell
had stated that:
we focus on the newspapers. They don't like to acknowledge that the papers that really matter
are the tabloids. I think one of the reasons Tony asked me to work for him, and why I wanted
to work for Tony, was that we both acknowledge the significance to the political debate of the
tabloids. (Guardian, 17 February 1997, cited in Green, 2006: 138)
However, a number of commentators have suggested that the shift to a more authori-
tarian penal stance by both parties was also influenced by a climate of opinion fostered
by the press over a very high profile child killing (Green, 2006; Littlechild, 1997;
NACRO, 2001; Newburn, 2007; Roberts et al., 2002). In early 1993 two 10-year-old
boys, John Venables and Robert Thompson, kidnapped and murdered two-year-old
Jamie Bulger. The press response to the crime was unprecedented. Across all national
newspapers, a total of 3765 inches of editorial copy were devoted to discussion of the
story (Franklin and Petley, 1996). The tabloid press, in particular were vitriolic in their
condemnation of Venables and Thompson and demanded a more punitive approach to
criminal justice policy:
The press corp was indeed in a vengeful mood. Editorials expressed outrage, demanded
retribution and offered a range of policy proposals designed to exact increasingly punitive
measures from the criminal justice system. The `demonising' of Thompson and Venables was
so relentless in the British press that one observer was prompted to describe it as, `the kind of
Berry et al. 571
outbreak of moral condemnation that is usually reserved for the enemy in times of war'.
(Franklin and Petley, 1996: 134)
The intense media focus coincided with significant public disorder. Angry mobs
drove the families of Venables and Thompson from their homes and they had to be re-
housed for their own protection. Following the decision to set a minimum tariff of eight
years in custody for the two boys, sections of the tabloid press began a campaign to try
and increase their sentence to a full life term. The Sun asked its readers to fill in a coupon
which read `Dear Home Secretary I agree with Ralph and Denise Bulger that the boys
who killed their son James should stay in jail for LIFE' (Reg. v. Secretary of State for the
Home Department, 1997­1998). It ran this campaign under headlines such as `80,000
call T.V. to say Bulger killers must rot in jail' (Reg. v. Secretary of State for the Home
Department, 1997­1998). These are examples of what are termed `informally solicited
polls' or SLOPs (`self-selected listener opinion polls'). Despite the fact that such polls
produced non-generalizable statistically invalid polls, `once they are broadcast' Fiskin
(1995: 140, cited in Green, 2006: 135) notes `their results take on a life of their own' and
`become representations of public opinion that are communicated to candidates, com-
mentators and citizens alike'. This appears to have happened in the Jamie Bulger case.
After receiving a petition with 278,300 signatures, 5000 letters and 21,281 Sun coupons,
Home Secretary Michael Howard citing `public concern' increased the minimum tariff
to 15 years.2
Similar pressures were evident in the wake of another child killing in July 2000.
Following the sexual assault and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne, the News of
World was at the forefront of a campaign to `name and shame' convicted paedophiles,
stiffen sentences and introduce notification legislation, dubbed `Sarah's Law'.3 This
campaign mobilized support from certain senior justice professionals and members of
the Conservative party. However it also appeared again to contribute to significant
instances of public disorder as well as vigilante attacks on paedophiles and suspected
paedophiles. Eventually the News of the World suspended its campaign of naming
convicted paedophiles on the condition that the Government review the notification
legislation ­ which it was in fact already doing. Roberts et al. (2002) argue that this
tabloid campaign created a very difficult environment for policymakers. Despite the
consensus among `informed opinion' being that the British registration arrangements
were `at least as effective as those introduced under Megan's and related US initiatives'
the Government came under tremendous pressure to change policy (2002: 51). On this
occasion it stood firm against a change in the legislation but `without doubt the [News
of the World] campaign has served to compound public frustration about the criminal
justice system and has simultaneously constrained politician's ability to locate strate-
gies that genuinely minimise the risk of predatory paedophile crime' (2002: 51). In
the years following Sarah Payne's murder, the tabloid press has continued to press
for the introduction of `Sarah's law'. The response from policymakers has been to
tighten the web of civil measures designed to monitor offenders (Thomas, 2005). These
have involved changes to the rules governing the operation of the sex offenders' regis-
ter such as reducing the time that offenders are given to notify police stations of their
presence, more power for police to fingerprint, photograph and take iris scans of
572 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
offenders, and sharply increased custodial sentences for non-compliance with a range
of new restriction orders issued by courts (Thomas, 2005). Eventually however, the
Government bowed to media pressure and in September 2008 moved to pilot a notifi-
cation system in four areas of England. In August 2010 it was announced that the
scheme would be implemented across England and Wales in March 2011 (Guardian, 1
August 2010). This move drew criticism from the NSPCC who expressed concern that
media attention and fear of subsequent vigilante attacks may drive released offenders
underground so that they cannot be monitored and absent themselves from treatment
programmes (Independent, 2 August 2010).
The research evidence in this review suggests that in the area of serious crimes against
children the media, and in particular the tabloid press, can create climates of opinion
which can constrain politicians' ability to locate and implement appropriate criminal
justice policy. Instead politicians may be pressured to enact policies which placate sec-
tions of the media, rather than ones which research evidence suggest are actually likely
to be effective. Our own research investigates the existence of such processes by examin-
ing the editorial content of key sections of the media and the reporting of particular
crimes and sentences. We also examine possible impacts on attitudes and understandings
among different sections of the public.
Sample and Method
The sample consists of coverage in nine newspapers from 1 January to 31 March 2010.
These were the broadsheets The Times, the Guardian and the Daily Telegraph, three
tabloids, the Daily Mail, the Sun and the Daily Mirror, and three regional papers, the
Belfast Telegraph, the Scotsman and the Western Mail. We also included the regional
editions of all national newspapers except the Guardian. We selected the tabloids and
broadsheets on the basis that they have the largest circulations in their segments of the
press. The regionals were chosen on the basis that they had substantial readerships in
the three devolved areas of the UK (Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales). The three-
month sample period was selected on the basis that this would provide a sufficiently
large selection of newspaper articles to be representative of reporting in this area.
The sample was supplemented by the main news on BBC One, since this has a very
wide national viewing audience and is the news source most trusted by the public
(Barnett, 2008). For television news, we recorded all the BBC One 10 o'clock news
programmes from the period of the sample and retrieved relevant items. For the news-
paper sample, articles were identified using the Nexis facility which provided elec-
tronic copies through the use of key words. Since we were primarily interested in cases
in which a particular sentence was mentioned we used a series of 29 search items which
had to co-occur with either the keywords sentence, sentenced, jailed or prison. The
search items were murder, murdered, assault, assaulting, assaulted, murdering, killed,
killing, manslaughter, abused, abandoned, sexual abuse, sexually abused, sexually
abusing, paedophile, pornography, pornographic, porn, grooming, groomed, groom,
incest, trafficking, trafficked, raped, raping, rape, neglect and child cruelty.
Only articles which contained mention of a sentence for the crime that was reported
were included in the sample. This identified a total of 4747 articles. We ran a further
Berry et al. 573
three-month search to check the sample we had selected had not been skewed by the
presence of unusually high profile crimes. The searches for the same three-month period
in 2009 returned 4725 articles thus confirming that our sample was not atypical. The
sample was then refined in new searches to identify those which specifically fitted the
crime categories for this analysis. These were killings, sexual offences against children,
physical abuse and neglect. These categories were chosen not because they correspond
exactly to legal definitions, but because they represent broadly the descriptions which are
typically offered in media accounts. We excluded some other types of incident such as
child-on-child injuries or killings, as well as gang or knife crime. The central focus was
therefore crimes of violence, neglect or sexual abuse by adults against children. This left
a total of 253 articles. Each article was then coded on according to a series of criteria.
These were:
1. Date.
2. Newspaper.
 3. Unique crime number.
 4. Offence category (Killing/Sexual Abuse/Viewing Child Pornography/Physical
Assault/Neglect).
 5. Total sentence.
 6. Community sentence (Yes/No).
 7. Community sentence length specified (Yes/No).
 8. Community sentence length.
 9. Probation (Yes/No).
10. Probation length specified (Yes/No).
11. Probation length.
12. Life sentence (Yes/No).
13. Life sentence minimum length to be served specified (Yes/No).
14. Life sentence minimum length to be served.
15. Indeterminate sentence (Yes/No).
16. Indeterminate sentence minimum length to be served specified (Yes/No).
17. Indeterminate sentence minimum length to be served.
18. Suspended sentence (Yes/No).
19. Relationship between offender and victim (not specified/parent/step-parent or
parent's partner/other relative/people known ­ friends, etc.).
20. Comment on sentence (Yes/No).
21. Nature of Comment on sentence (Too short/Too long/Appropriate long/
Appropriate short).
22. Who was comment from (Victim's relative/expert/judge/prosecution/defence/
victim/offender's relative/editorial/comment piece/letter writer/vox pop/
offender/victim's relatives or friends/offender's relatives or friends)
Categories 19­22 were then repeated for any further comments by another actor relating
to the same crime. Then categories 4­22 were repeated for any subsequent crime reported
within the same newspaper article.
574 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
Once the coding was completed all data were entered in into SPSS for all statistical
analyses. The coding scheme meant that the key unit of analysis is crime incidents
reported rather than newspaper articles. There are two rationales for this. First, some
newspaper articles report on different sentences for multiple perpetrators who were
convicted of either the same or different offences. An example from our sample was the
Kyra Ishtaq killing where both the mother and stepfather were reported as being given
separate sentences for the killing of the young girl. A second reason for adopting crime
incidents as the unit of analysis is that newspaper articles sometimes reference different
crime incidents and the sentence attached to them within the course of a single article.
So an article discussing a contemporary child killing might then move on to discuss a
sentence handed down for a previous instance or instances of the same crime.
The purpose of the content analysis was to provide a broad overview of different
aspects of reporting. However we supplemented the quantitative analysis with an in-
depth qualitative analysis where we examined in closer detail the range of meanings,
arguments and explanations offered in news accounts. To do this we employed a type of
qualitative analysis termed thematic analysis which has been developed and refined over
more than three decades by the Glasgow Media Group (1976, 1980) in areas such as
industrial news, food scares and risk (Philo, 1999), international development (Philo,
1999), war and conflict reporting (Glasgow Media Group, 1985; Philo and Berry, 2004,
2011) and the representation of mental illness (Philo, 1996). This method is based on the
assumption that in any controversial area there are competing ways of explaining events
or issues. These explanations are linked to particular interests which seek to explain the
world in ways that justify their own position. The media are thus conceptualized as a
space where different interest groups ideologically compete to try and make sure that
their explanations are dominant and accepted by audiences. For instance, in the 1970s
and 1980s, the Glasgow Media Group (1976, 1980) examined the reporting of debates
surrounding the problems of the British economy which was widely seen to be falling
behind its international competitors. This research demonstrated that while the causes for
this malaise were hotly contested, broadcast media chose to ignore some explanations
(underinvestment and management failings) while prominently featuring and sometimes
directly endorsing others (unions and strike action). In the current study we examined the
range of debate that newspapers offered in relation to crime and criminal policy. This
included commentary on the sentences handed out to offenders and prescriptions for
reducing re-offending and protecting public safety. Our quantitative analysis captured all
articles, whether they be hard news or comment pieces, which mentioned a crime where
a specific sentence was reported. We chose not to make a clear distinction between
editorials and hard news because, particularly in the tabloid press, hard news is struc-
tured in order to pursue the themes that are established by the editorial line of the news-
paper. Our qualitative analysis also included 21 articles from our sample period which
did not appear in our quantitative analysis. These provided commentary on the crimes we
were focusing on but did not mention a particular sentence. Our aim here was to capture
other reporting in our sample period which was likely to influence public attitudes.
Our audience research consisted of large scale representative polling carried out by
the company Yougov in April 2010. Two questions were put to the sample:
Berry et al. 575
· In court cases where people are found guilty of crimes of cruelty, physical or
sexual abuse or the killing of children do you think that the sentences that are
given in general are: Too long/About right/Too short/Don't know?
· In court cases where people are found guilty of crimes of cruelty, physical or
sexual abuse or the killing of children, people are sometimes given indeterminate
sentences. Do you think that these are in general: Too long/Neither/Too short/
Don't know?
The polling was stratified by both newspaper readership and socio-economic status
(National Readership Survey classification) allowing for an examination of how these
variables are related to understanding and attitudes.
Results
Quantitative analysis
Our three-month sample generated a total of 253 separate articles in nine newspapers and
four television reports. We were surprised by the extremely low number of television
reports in this area since research has consistently shown that television is the main
source of news for approximately two-thirds of the population (Ofcom, 2007).
Furthermore within television, the BBC is by far the most popular and trusted news
source (Ofcom, 2007). Clearly, in relation to the construction of public knowledge and
attitudes concerning serious crimes against children, the press is key while BBC national
news is likely to have a very marginal role. Only the most high profile crimes such as the
Soham murders, the Khyra Ishaq killing and the `British Fritzl' case were featured on
BBC television news. In our press sample, we found that because some articles cited
multiple crimes, the total number of references to crimes against children was 271.
Our sample also picked up the same crime reported over many days and in different
newspapers. The total number of unique crimes reported over the three-month period of
our sample was 120. On average, each individual crime generated just over two articles
across newspapers and television news. This measure of unique crimes also allowed for
an estimation of the significance of very high profile crimes. Our research suggests that
these accounted for a substantial share of all newspaper coverage of crimes against
children. The eight most heavily reported crimes (6.7% of unique crimes) accounted for
just over a third (34.0%) of all newspaper references to crimes against children with the
three highest profile offences accounting for 18.8 per cent of all references. A list of the
10 most reported crimes in order of prominence is given below:
1. Soham murders ­ Ian Huntley, a school caretaker was convicted of two counts of
murder for the killing of two 10-year-old schoolgirls, Holly Wells and Jessica
Chapman.
2. `British Fritzl' ­ a 54-year-old businessman was given 25 concurrent life
sentences for the repeated rape of his two daughters over a 25-year period.
He fathered seven surviving children with his daughters.
576 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
3. Khyra Ishaq killing ­ a mother and stepfather were convicted of starving to death
seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq.
4. Baby `P' murder ­ Peter Connelly, a 17-month-old boy died after suffering more
than 50 injuries. The boy's mother Tracey Connelly together with her boyfriend
Steven Barker and his father Jason Owen were convicted of `causing or allowing
the death of a child or vulnerable person'. The case was particularly controversial
because the boy had been repeatedly seen by child protection in the months
leading up to his death.
5. Mother jailed for forcing son to fake serious illness in order to solicit money ­ a
mother was jailed for three years after falsely claiming for six years that he was
severely disabled and suffering from life threatening illnesses. During this period,
she fraudulently claimed state benefits and awards from charities.
6. Teenager jailed for raping nine-year-old girl ­ a 17-year-old boy was given an
indeterminate sentence for committing rape, sexual assault and grievous bodily
harm on a nine-year-old girl while on bail for raping a 10-year-old girl.
7. Baby `P' prisoner loses rape appeal ­ Steven Barker who was convicted in the
Baby `P' case, (see no. 4) was reported to have lost his appeal against a further
conviction for child rape.
8. Mother and daughter murdered by convicted paedophile ­ a former soldier and
convicted sex offender was convicted of raping a mother and her 10-year-old
daughter.
9. Convicted paedophile given suspended jail sentence due to obesity ­ a church
elder was given a suspended sentence for indecently assaulting a minor over an
eight-year period. The judge cited his lack of mobility, ulcerated legs and need
for frequent dressing as being `wholly exceptional circumstances'.
10. Girl on trial for throwing banana at home of her sex attacker ­ a case against a girl
who threw fruit at the home of a man convicted of having underage sex with her
was dropped by the prosecution. The original decision to prosecute was heavily
criticized by another judge not directly involved with the case.
These results suggest that the seriousness of the crime is the key factor affecting the
likelihood that an offence will be heavily reported but that other factors such as alleged
judicial leniency and the unusual nature of some crimes are also significant news values.4
What is also clear is that high profile crimes such as the Baby `P' case and the Soham
murders can remain prominent in news coverage long after the trials have concluded. In
these cases it was subsequent events such as an attack on Ian Huntley in prison or an
appeal by a prisoner convicted in the Baby `P' murder which triggered further discus-
sion of these offences. There is also considerable cross-referencing of past cases in the
reporting of `new' crimes.
In Table 1 we provide details of the proportion of the most serious offences of child
killing and sexual abuse which are reported as attracting life or indeterminate sentences.
The table also contains information on how frequently the details of minimum tariffs are
reported.
The clearest finding from this analysis is that information about minimum tariffs
attached to these sentences is less frequently reported in the tabloids than it is in the
Berry et al. 577
broadsheet press. There is quantitatively less information about details of the most
serious sentences reported in this segment of the media. Table 2 provides details of the
average sentences for different crimes across the media. There are no obvious patterns
and this is in line with previous research which has found that the tabloid media overall
do not report disproportionately on crimes which have attracted allegedly lenient sen-
tences (Hough and Roberts, 1999). They will however in some cases focus on `leniency'
when this is perceived to occur.
In Table 3 we provide details of the pattern of reported offender profiles across the
media. Tabloids are significantly less likely than broadsheets to provide information
about the relationship between victim and offender. As in reporting of minimum terms
attached to life and indeterminate sentences, there is quantitatively less information

provided in the tabloids than in the broadsheets. Where the offender­victim relationship
is stated, clear patterns can be seen. With regard to child killings the perpetrators are
overwhelmingly reported as being parents or step-parents across all newspaper catego-
ries. In cases of sexual abuse where a relationship is stated, the perpetrator is rarely
identified as a stranger in any newspaper category. Broadsheets are more likely than
tabloids to identify parents as being perpetrators of sexual abuse but in all types of news-
paper, the most common perpetrator identified is a person known to the family such as a
neighbour or a friend. Although it may appear that the most reported sexual threat to
children comes not from `stranger danger' but from the immediate known environment
of home and neighbourhood, an important qualification should be made in the sense of
what is understood to be a `stranger'. A neighbour might be defined as someone who is
`known' but some high profile cases have involved killings by neighbours who had a
previous and unknown history of sexual assault. It is the unknown part of their history
which defines them in some public debate as being potentially dangerous and has led to
both media and public demands for access to such information.
In the next set of tables we examine who was reported as commenting on sentences
and what they actually said about the tariffs. Table 4 gives a breakdown of who was
reported as commenting across different parts of the media. Across all sections of the
press criminal justice professionals were the most commonly quoted commentators on
the appropriateness of sentencing. Within this category judges were by far the most fre-
quent contributors, accounting for 59 per cent of all comments from criminal justice
professionals. What is also noticeable is the substantial degree of editorializing in the
tabloids, and to a lesser extent in the regional press, but which is absent from the
broadsheets.
Table 5 provides details of whether the different groups who made comments on sen-
tencing expressed approval or disapproval at the sentence handed down. We have pro-
vided categories which differentiate between comments which express the view that the
sentence was severe and warranted (appropriate long) and those who argue that the sen-
tence was short but correct (appropriate short).

We found that criminal justice professionals, and in particular judges, were the main
source of comment which expressed the view that sentences were appropriate. They
justified both long- and short-term sentences. There was one exception to this which
involved a case in which the Sun reported that a judge had `hit out' at sentencing guide-
lines which prevented him from imposing an indefinite sentence on an offender who
the judge described as `a very real risk to children' (18 March 2010). Interventions
from politicians and newspapers were always on the basis that sentencing had been too
lenient. Newspapers reinforced this perception that sentencing was too lenient by using
vox pops. This could be done in the form of a direct quotation from a member of the
public expressing disapproval at a sentencing decision but it could also be achieved
by citing public anger as in a comment from the Sun that a decision to hand down a
suspended sentence to a mother who had been repeatedly convicted for child cruelty
`sparked outrage' (19 January 2010). Table 6 provides a breakdown of approving/
disapproving comments on sentencing by newspaper category. This demonstrates that
the tabloid and regional press account for all comments critical of sentences for being
too short. In contrast the broadsheets did not contain a single instance where a com-
ment critical of a specific sentence length was made in a news report, though the Daily
Telegraph did feature two editorials which made criticisms of sentencing in general.
In reports of child killings, we found that almost all the negative comments on sen-
tencing were attached to very high profile cases. In the tabloids 14 out of the 16 criti-
cisms of sentencing were concentrated on the `Baby P', Khyra Ishaq or Soham murders.
For instance, the life sentence with a minimum term of 40 years given to Ian Huntley was

criticized in editorials in both the Daily Mail (23 March 2010) and the Mirror (27 March
2010) both of whom argued that Huntley should have been executed. A different pattern
arises in the comments tied to cases of sexual abuse. Here we did find that a great deal of
critical commentary on sentencing centred around cases where allegedly short sentences
were handed out. One case which involved a man who had been given a suspended
sentence for repeatedly sexually abusing a young girl over several years attracted nearly
half the critical comments on sentencing.
While the central focus of the study was reports where specific sentences were stated
we also examined commentaries on sentencing which did not mention a specific
sentence in a case. We found 21 of these of which 19 involved criticism that sentencing
was too short. All but three of these appeared in the tabloid press. Most of the criticism
was expressed either in the form of editorial/comment pieces or in letters to the editors,
though the tabloid press also featured two critical comments from victim support groups.
Overall the editorial comments which criticized sentence length tended to be much
longer and more emotive than the commentary provided by judges which justified their
sentencing decisions.
Our final set of tables list the result of the YouGov polls on public attitudes. Table 7
shows that 82 per cent of the public believe that sentences given for such crimes against
children are too short. This figure is higher than poll results for perceptions of general
sentencing leniency in the criminal justice system and reflects the intense public antipa-
thy towards offences against children. For readers of the five largest tabloids the average
figure is 88.6 per cent. For Sun and Daily Mail readers, the figure is 91 per cent.
Broadsheet readers appear less negative about sentencing policy. For readers of the four
largest broadsheets the proportion who thought sentences too short was 67.5 per cent.
This average figure however masks significant variations: 85 per cent of Daily Telegraph
readers saw sentences as being too lenient while for Guardian readers the figure was 46
per cent. Socio-economic status is also related to attitudes, with lower socio-economic
groups exhibiting more punitive attitudes, though these differences are quite modest in
comparison to the variations linked to newspaper consumption.
The poll results presented in Table 8 indicate that there is a great deal of public
confusion about the `the indeterminate sentence for public protection'5 (IPP). This is a
relatively recent tariff, which is frequently employed in cases of serious crimes against
children. Overall, 67 per cent of the population believe these sentences for crimes
against children are too short. There were again significant variations in responses
between readers of tabloids and broadsheets: 75.5 per cent of tabloid readers thought

IPP sentences were too short while the average for broadsheet readers was 51 per cent.
It was also noticeable that the proportion of `don't knows' for broadsheet readers (20%)
was nearly double that of tabloids (11.5%). This may be because tabloids and their
readers tend to see the criminal justice system as being `soft' in general and thus feel
confident in putting forward an opinion. Alternatively it may be because they have been
influenced by some of the tabloid criticism of indeterminate sentences which we exam-
ine in our qualitative analysis below. It is also clear that socio-economic status is related
to attitudes with those in higher occupational groups being less likely to see IPP
sentences as being too short, though again it is clear that this a much weaker predictor
of attitudes than newspaper consumption.

these is the difficulty of understanding complex dimensions of different sentences for
specific crimes. Such intrinsic difficulties are likely to be exacerbated by the manner in
which crimes are reported. Journalists sometimes pack large amounts of detail in a few
column inches, as for example in this report from The Times, which cites multiple
offences, dates and sentences relating to the same person:
In cases involving very young child complainant witnesses, a delay between the alleged offence
and the making of an allegation or the hearing of the trial, did not, by itself, automatically
prevent the evidence of the child from being considered by the jury. The Court of Appeal,
Criminal Division, so held when granting applications for leave but dismissing appeals by
Steven Barker: (i) against his conviction on May 1, 2009, at the Central Criminal Court (Judge
Kramer, QC and a jury) for an offence of anal rape of a child, under 13 years of age, contrary
to section 5(1) of the Sexual OffencesAct 2003, and (ii) against his sentence of life imprisonment
with a minimum term of 10 years, imposed on May 22, 2009, by the same court. The defendant
was also imprisoned at the same time for 12 years concurrent, for causing or allowing the death
of a child, known as `Baby P', contrary to section 5 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and
Victims Act 2004, of which he was convicted after trial on November 11, 2008. (The Times, 5
February 2010)
The meaning of certain types of sentence is also unclear in some newspaper reports.
In the aftermath of the Baby `P' case, there were complaints that the mother was given
an indeterminate sentence but with a minimum of just five years. The Attorney General's
office issued a statement saying that it could review minimum tariffs imposed on inde-
terminate sentence prisoners, but made this clarification:
It is important to understand that such prisoners are not released automatically after the
minimum term has been served ­ they are only released when the independent Parole Board is
satisfied that their continued detention is no longer necessary to protect the public. (Daily
Telegraph, 27 May 2009)
This confusion was also evident in the reaction to the indeterminate sentence given to
Junaid Abuhamza in the Khyra Ishaq case. This sentence was criticized by both the
victim's relatives and a politician for being too short:
Ishaq Abu Zaire raged after his ex was led away with her child-torturing lover, who could
serve just 7-and-a-half years. `If it was up to me they would have got much longer'. (Sun, 13
March 2010)
I think their actions were inexcusable. If it was up to me they would have got a much longer
sentence. They knew what they were doing was wrong. (Mirror, 13 March 2010)
If it was up to me they would have got a much longer sentence than they were given. (Daily
Mail, 13 March 2010)
Khalid Mahmood, Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr ... added: `There is a sense they
have got off lightly here. I and many other feel there should have been murder convictions.'
(Daily Mail, 13 March 2010)
Berry et al. 583
This perception was also evident in some public responses to the case. Following the
conclusion of the case the Sun printed a letter from a member of the public: `The patheti-
cally short sentences given to Angela Gordon and her partner show why our prisons are
full. There is no deterrent to make people behave within the law' (Sun, 18 March 2010).
Other confusions may arise because of the different accounts which are sometimes
given about the same sentences. In the Khyra Ishaq case for example, the Guardian
reported for the mother and stepfather these were `indefinite' and that the mother would
serve `at least 15 years before becoming eligible for parole':
Headline: Indefinite jail terms for couple who starved seven-year-old to death: `Harsh and
cruel' mother must serve at least 15 years ...
A mother and stepfather who starved a seven-year-old child to death were given indefinite jail
sentences yesterday for manslaughter. Angela Gordon, 35, was told by a judge at Birmingham
crown court that she would serve at least 15 years before becoming eligible for parole. Her
partner, Junaid Abuhamza, 31, was told he would serve a minimum term of seven and a half
years. (Guardian, 13 March 2010)
But the headlines for the Sun and the Mirror stressed that the mother will be freed from
prison in five years:
Headline: OUT IN 5½ YEARS ... MUM WHO STARVED KHYRA: Fury at killer's sentence.
(Sun, 13 March 2010)
Headline: THIS MOTHER STARVED ONE CHILD TO DEATH, DRENCHED 5 OTHERS
AND MADE THEM STAND IN FRONT OF A COLD FAN. YESTERDAY SHE WAS
SENTENCED TO 15 YEARS IN JAIL ... YET SHE'LL BE OUT IN FIVE
The cruel mum who killed her skeletal daughter Khyra Ishaq may be freed from prison in just
five years. Angela Gordon was sentenced yesterday to 15 years in jail for the seven-year-old's
manslaughter and cruelty to her five other children. But the judge told her she will only serve
seven-and-a-half years ­ minus nearly two years that have passed while she has been in custody
awaiting trial. (Mirror, 13 March 2010)
Such variations in reporting the same sentence were not uncommon in our sample.
Across all instances of child killing, where a life sentence was given out and the
sentence was reported more than once we found that in 43 per cent of cases (6/14)
the sentence was reported differently in different newspapers. Most commonly some
reported a life sentence with a minimum and other reported it as a term sentence.
The same pattern could be observed in relation to indeterminate sentencing. For instance
Vanessa George was reported as receiving a seven-year jail term in the Sun for sexually
abusing children in her care (10 February 2010). However in the Western Mail the sen-
tence was reported as being an indeterminate sentence with the proviso that `she must
serve at least seven years in prison' (12 March 2010).
Another source of potential confusion and controversy is variations between sen-
tences given for different crimes and the issue of how appropriate are these tariffs. Such
584 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
arguments do not only relate to crimes against children but they tap into generalized
beliefs about the supposed leniency of sentencing and irrationality in the justice system.
Here for example, a commentary in the Daily Telegraph (15 March 2010) is introduced
with the phrase: `Headline: It's simple ­ punishment should fit the crime; Philip Johnston
says he can't be the only one left confused by the current trends in sentencing.'The jour-
nalist makes the point about public confusion by comparing different cases:
Peter Chapman, the vile killer of Ashleigh Hall, the teenager who met him on Facebook, had
previously spent five years in jail for raping two women at knifepoint. How is that possible?
Frances Inglis, who killed the son she loved with a dose of heroin because he was in a coma
from which she feared he would never recover, is serving at least 10 years in jail. How could
that possibly merit twice the punishment meted out to Chapman? ... Confused? You are not
alone. (Daily Telegraph, 15 March 2010)
The Sun in more colourful language makes the same point about variations in sentenc-
ing while also linking this to the argument that dangerous people should not be released
from prison:
Editorial: Legal lunacy ...
Ryan Yates was considered a serious danger to women when he was freed from prison. Three
days later, a court order was obtained banning him from going near females. Two days after that
he attempted to murder a grandmother in broad daylight then kidnap and rape her grand-
daughters. No order or restriction was going to make a blind bit of difference toYates'behaviour.
A cell, locks and prison bars were the only things which would have made the public safe.
Instead our laws meant Yates HAD to be freed despite the knowledge he was a serious risk. On
the flipside, a law-abiding businessman finds himself out of pocket and with three penalty
points on his licence because he blew his nose while behind the wheel of his van. Not a van
doing 70mph on the motorway, but one in stationary traffic with the handbrake on ... Common
sense is clearly in short supply in legal circles. (Sun, 28 January 2010)
It was also apparent in our research that there were substantial variations in sentenc-
ing for crimes that were in some respects similar. For example, on 27 January 2010, the
Mirror reported that a computer expert had been sentenced to nine months in jail for
possessing images of child abuse. He had fled to the USA after a first court appearance
but was later extradited: `Headline: 9 MONTHS JAIL FOR CHILD PORN PERV'
(Mirror, 27 January 2010). Three days later, the Western Mail reported that a former
police employee, found to have indecent photographs on his computer, had avoided jail.
Some of these pictures were described as being in the `serious' indecent category and he
had been sharing photos with another sex offender. The sentence given was a three-year
community order and he was reported to be `much loved' by family and friends:
`Headline: Former police employee avoids jail over child porn' (Western Mail, 30
January 2010).
We can also compare the reporting of two cases in which men had a sexual relation-
ship with underage girls. In the first of these a man, said to be an alcoholic, was jailed for
18 months for having sex with a 14-year-old girl:
Berry et al. 585
Headline: MAN, 38, HAD SEX WITH GIRL
An alcoholic of 38 who slept with a schoolgirl was jailed for 18 months yesterday and put on
the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years ... The guilty plea by Madden, from York Drive,
Belfast, was on the agreed basis he had sex with the youngster after they had been drinking.
A judge said there was `no excuse whatsoever in entering into any sexual relationship with such
a young girl'. (Mirror, 6 February 2010)
Although there is `no excuse' according to the above judgment, the sentence in the
second case is quite different. Here a soldier from Sandhurst who is accused of having
sex with a 13-year-old girl is reported to have been spared jail. In this case, the girl was
said by a judge `to have made all the running':
Headline: SOLDIER WHO HAD SEX WITH GIRL, 13, IS SPARED JAIL BY LADY JUDGE
WHO SAYS VICTIM `MADE ALL THE RUNNING'
A soldier at Sandhurst who had sex with a 13-year-old girl was spared jail by a woman judge
who said the victim was `precocious' and `made all the running.' (Daily Mail, 9 January 2010)
Alongside these apparent contradictions and confusions, there is a strong current of
opinion expressed in editorials and comment pages that sentences are too low. This is
partly stated as a moral argument that serious crimes require substantial punishment, but
is also linked to a debate about public safety. The first of these is clear in the following
example from the Sun, where a mother is reported to have left her children in a `pigsty'
home as she went on a `booze and drug bender'. The focus of the story is the `outrage'
said to have been sparked by the judge who ordered a suspended sentence and that fol-
lowing a further offence she has again escaped jail. The rationale for the sentences or
what the relationship is between the suspended sentence and a curfew which is men-
tioned are all sidelined by the moral judgements around which the report is based:
Headline: Booze mum left four tots in this sty
This is the pigsty home where a mum left her four kids to go on a 24-hour booze and drug
bender. Selfish Rebecca ..., 23, abandoned the youngsters aged three months to four years in
the house littered with empty bottles and kitchen knives ... (She) admitted child cruelty after
being exposed by The Sun last year, but a judge sparked outrage by giving her a suspended
sentence. Yesterday she was back in court for breaching a curfew a month later. (She) had left
a pal's house in Bolton three times in the early hours of New Year's Day. She was so drunk she
couldn't remember the third trip, Lancaster Crown Court was told. But Judge Norman Wright
refused to jail her AGAIN and ordered another curfew. He said: `I am going to give you one
further chance.' (Sun, 19 January 2010)
Concerns over public safety are highlighted by the reporting of a case such as that
of Thomas Smith in February 2010. He was a convicted sex offender who had moved
back to an area where his past history was largely unknown and had then murdered a
neighbour and also killed and raped her young daughter. As The Times reported:
586 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
A convicted sex offender who raped and murdered a 10-year old girl and killed her mother has
been handed down one of the longest ever sentences in Scotland ... Strathclyde Police are now
reviewing how 26-year-old Smith, a known sex offender, was able to strike again. (The Times,
6 February 2010)
The Sun's (6 February 2010) headline expresses the point more forcefully: `Headline:
BENCHMARK FOR ATROCITY; Paedo living with NO supervision kills mum and
girl, 10.'
The debate over public safety in much of the press focuses on two issues. First the
right for public information about offenders who have been released and second the
question of whether dangerous criminals should have much longer sentences. The for-
mer is seen clearly in demands for `Sarah's Law' as in the following report from the
Mirror. The fact that the killer has now been given an indefinite sentence is subsumed to
the main argument on the need for public warnings:
Headline: SARAH'S LAW PLEA FROM RETIRED COP
An ex-senior policeman demanded the nationwide introduction of Sarah's Law to control
paedophiles yesterday. Mick Gradwell spoke out after being sickened by the case of a convicted
sex fiend who raped a young boy ... Mr Gradwell said: `You can have warnings on hot drinks,
yet there are certain people who admit they are a danger and we're not allowed to give any
warnings at all.' (Mirror, 6 January 2010)
The perceived failure to give long sentences for serious crimes is, as we have seen,
attributed to the irrationality of the judicial system. The following example from the Sun
comments on the scrapping of an early release scheme and points to the alleged problems
of `weak judges and feeble sentencing guidelines':
Editorial: Crime Chaos
So the scandalous early-release scheme which lets violent thugs back on to our streets without
finishing their jail sentences is to be scrapped.Anyone would think there was an election coming
up ­ and that Labour is vulnerable on crime. But if the Government really wants to act tough at
long last on the lawlessness that has engulfed Britain, it had better do something fast about the
liberal hand-wringers masquerading as our judges ... A brute repeatedly stabs his neighbour, an
alcoholic with seven driving bans leads police on a high-speed chase, a crooked carer fleeces a
disabled woman, a pervert amasses 3,400 child porn pictures. Not one of them given a moment
behind bars. Of course it is right to force jailed criminals to serve out their time. But it's just
window-dressing if weak judges and feeble sentencing guidelines ensure violent, dangerous,
callous criminals are never banged up in the first place. (Sun, 15 February 2010)
Another story based on a parliamentary answer pursues the same theme:
Headline: LESS THAN YEAR FOR PERVERTS
Paedophiles and rapists are being jailed for less than a year, The Sun can reveal. There are FIVE
perverts serving less than 12 months for sex assaults against children and 21 thugs in prison
Berry et al. 587
serving sentences of under a year for rape ... Fury over soft justice has been fuelled by a series
of lenient sentences in recent years. (Sun, 1 April 2010)
We will now close this article by drawing together the key features of coverage, con-
sidering their impact on public understanding and attitudes and asking what academics
and those working within criminal justice can do to promote a more informed citizenry.
Conclusion
The picture of press reporting of sentencing that emerges from our qualitative and
quantitative analysis is a chaotic and confusing one. There appear to be wide variations
in the sentences handed down for what appear very similar crimes and there is rarely a
developed rationale for these discrepancies. There is also a great deal of uncertainty
over the period that offenders will be incarcerated. The same sentence is frequently
reported differently in different newspapers. Against this backdrop, there is a strong and
consistent editorial line in the tabloids which is highly critical of the judiciary and the
criminal justice system. This manifests itself in a steady drumbeat of criticism in
relation to sentencing guidelines and the behaviour of judges, together with demands
for tougher sanctions and notification legislation. These are justified both for public
safety and in the name of a moral concern at the abhorrence of the crimes. While
criminal justice professionals are frequently cited in all sections of the press their
contributions are usually quite short and rarely extend to more than a sentence or two.
In the tabloid press their attempts to justify their decisions tend to be drowned out by
editorials and comment which are critical.
The pattern of newspaper reporting that we encountered might be expected to gener-
ate widespread public dissatisfaction and confusion over the nature of sentencing policy.
This is what we found. Public attitudes towards sentencing in this area appear very harsh.
Although socio-economic status correlates negatively with punitiveness it is a very weak
predictor in comparison to media consumption. Our research design does not allow us to
make strong statements regarding the directionality of this relationship and part of the
reason why newspaper consumption is such a strong predictor of punitive attitudes is
likely to be due to those with liberal attitudes being drawn to titles like the Guardian or
the Independent.6 It is also likely that a paper such as the Guardian has a readership with
experience in areas like social policy and sentencing decisions. However evaluating the
results of this study in line with previous research does suggest that press coverage is a
significant driver of punitive attitudes reasons (Brillon et al., 1984; Doob and Roberts,
1988; Roberts and Stalans, 1997; Sprott, 1996). As noted in the introduction, part of the
reason why participants respond so punitively in opinion polls is due to the fact they
answer with the worst offences in mind and that in evaluating sentencing policy, they
tend to recall cases where allegedly lenient sentences are handed out. This pattern of
coverage, as our analysis shows, is particularly visible in the tabloid press where there is
a heavy concentration of comment on particularly notorious crimes and a steady stream
of criticism in relation to sentencing decisions. What is also clear is that there is a great
deal of public misunderstanding about the IPP, which is now a key element of the
sentencing regime in this area. Two-thirds of the public believe these sentences are
588 Criminology & Criminal Justice 12(5)
`too short'. Even among Guardian readers who are widely seen as comprising the liberal
intelligentsia, with a wide readership among senior public sector workers including
many criminal justice professionals, the proportion who saw these sentences as being too
short or who answered `don't know' was 54 per cent. One factor contributing to this is
likely to be the lack of explanation in most press coverage of when those on indetermi-
nate sentences are likely to be released. Without explanation that these offenders have no
automatic right of release after their minimum term has been served, it is likely that there
is an assumption that they will automatically be freed. Clearly this new sanction has not
succeeded in reassuring the public that those who pose a threat to society will remain
incarcerated.
This research has illustrated some of the misconceptions and confusion regarding
sentencing policy in relation to crimes against children and how the media may be a
contributory factor. However as Roberts (2008) argues, attempts to insulate the criminal
justice system from a misinformed public are now seen as `isolationist, elitist and even
undemocratic'. One possible solution is for members of the criminal justice system
to engage in more outreach and education in order to explain better and justify their
sentencing decisions. This has been the approach taken by the Home Office who have
published and distributed leaflets about sentencing policy and the operation of the crimi-
nal justice system (e.g. Home Office, 2001). However Green (2006) has questioned the
utility of this approach. He argues that one-way expert to public communication flows
may be insufficient to produce durable changes in public attitudes. One reason for this
is that experts and many in the public have different frameworks of understanding for
the factors underlying criminality and how it might be countered. The cool dispassionate
analysis of crime favoured by experts may not resonate with the more affective frame-
works held by many in the public who tend to connect better with the emotional and
moralistic arguments put forward by the tabloids and populist politicians. While such
educational initiatives may produce short-term changes in attitudes, they do not allow
the public `to work through the ambivalent attitudes that crime and punishment often
produce and to develop considered views' (Green, 2006: 146). The consequence being
that `emotive media coverage and populist rhetoric may be enough to undermine any
gains these programmes produce'(Green, 2006: 146). Green suggests that an alternative
would be to employ deliberative opinion assessments such as `Deliberative Polls',
`Citizen Juries', `Consensus Conferences', `Study Circles', `National Issue Forums' or
`Planning Cells' (Ackerman and Fiskin, 2004). Deliberative polls involve recruiting
stratified random samples of the population who spend extended periods hearing
balanced presentations from experts and debating the issues among themselves. These
sessions are televised in order to make the process more transparent and engage those
not directly taking part. Green (2006) points to the success of a 1994 deliberate poll
conducted in Manchester on crime and punishment issues. The `follow-up assessments
indicated that participants tended to change their opinions markedly and durably because
of the deliberation process and most often in a liberalising direction, revealing a sharp
decline in enthusiasm for punitive, incarceral responses to crime' (2006: 134). But the
impacts of such exercises are likely to be felt most by those who participate directly.
A single televised message is much less powerful since it is situated in a plethora of
competing and often contradictory information streams. Television audiences can
Berry et al. 589
be reached but this requires the consistent repetition of clear alternatives and their
endorsement by high status, credible sources (see Philo and Berry, 2011). For this to
happen would require politicians and other `primary definers' to reshape media agendas
and the core content of messages on what `works' in relation to crime and penal policy.
At present the financial cost of punitive approaches and incarceration is forcing at least
some politicians to rethink traditional approaches. It is a timely moment to renew calls
for the media to adopt a more responsible and accurate reporting of crime and for spe-
cialists in this area to press for a more informed debate on criminal justice policy.
Notes
1. We would like to thank the NSPCC for contributing funding to this study.
2. This decision was eventually overturned following a series of controversial legal cases which
removed the power of home secretaries to set tariffs in such cases (Green, 2006).
3. Megan's Law is a scheme in the United States, which allows the publication of information
about convicted paedophiles. It arose following the murder of seven-year-old Megan Kanka in
New Jersey in 1992 by a convicted child sex offender who lived in the same neighbourhood as
the victim.
4. News values refer to the characteristics of a story which make it newsworthy. These include
factors such as immediacy, negativity, consonance, meaningfulness, cultural proximity and
unexpectedness (see Harcup and O'Neill, 2001).
5. Indeterminate sentencing for public protection (IPP) was introduced as part of the 2003
Criminal Justice Act and has been used by the judiciary since April 2005. The new measure
means judges set a `tariff period' that the offender must serve. However after this has expired
release is not automatic instead `a release direction can only be made if the Parole Board is sat-
isfied that the risk of harm the offender poses to the public is acceptable' (Ministry of Justice,
2010a). In practice `this means that indeterminate sentence prisoners could remain in prison
for many more years on preventative grounds after they have served the punitive period of
imprisonment set by the trial judge'(Ministry of Justice, 2010a). Indeterminate sentences have
been widely used since their introduction particularly in relation to serious offences against
children. The Department of Justice statistics show that 1001 IPPs were handed out in 2009
down from a peak of 1707 in 2007 (Ministry of Justice, 2010b).
6. In order to address more directly the question of how the media influence attitudes further
studies would need to employ focus group or interview research to trace the sources of audi-
ence beliefs and examine the conditions under which people accept or reject media accounts
(see Philo and Berry, 2011).
