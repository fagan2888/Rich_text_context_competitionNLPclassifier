Trends in the prevalence of hearing loss among US adults remain ambiguous because of variation across
surveys in question wording and limited use of audiometric examinations. Pooling samples of participants aged
20­69 years in 4 nationally representative cross-sectional survey series conducted from 1976 to 2006
(N ¼ 990,609), the authors performed logistic regression to quantify self-reporting biases compared with audio-
metric measurements. Statistically significant underreporting or overreporting of hearing loss was observed, with
various patterns of bias across age groups and surveys. Substantial upward reporting biases appeared among young
adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey since 1999 and in the National Health Interview
Survey since 1997. Trends in age-standardized prevalence of bilateral hearing loss were estimated with corrections
for self-reporting biases. Prevalence in men shifted from 9.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 7.8, 11.8) in 1978 to
12.2% (95% CI: 10.1, 14.7) in 1993 and declined to 8.1% (95% CI: 7.0, 9.5) in 2000. In women, prevalence was
relatively constant at approximately 6%­7% until the early 1990s and decreased from 7.0% (95% CI: 5.5, 9.1) in 1993
to 4.2% (95% CI: 3.4, 5.3) in 2000. Prevalence was stable in both sexes in the early 2000s. This approach to adjust for
biases in self-reported impairments by using measured performance may be useful in various health domains.

Hearing loss is a major public health problem in the United
States. One in every 6 American adults recently reported hav-
ing hearing trouble, and prevalence rises with age to reach half
of individuals aged 75 or more years (1). Hearing impairment
imposes a substantial burden on individuals and society and is
associated with poorer quality of life, increased comorbidity,
greaterdifficultieswithfunctionalactivities,andlowerincome
(2­9).
Tracking the prevalence of hearing loss over time is essen-
tial for formulation and evaluation of policies to improve
hearing status in the population. The ``gold standard'' for
measurement of hearing status is audiometry; however, au-
diometric testing among nationally representative samples
has been conducted relatively infrequently (10). A previous
study based on audiometric measures estimated the preva-
lence of bilateral hearing loss at the speech frequencies
among US adults aged 20­69 years to be 8% between 1999
and 2004, with no notable change during this period (11).
In contrast to the limited availability of audiometric data,
self-reports on hearing status have been elicited regularly in
multiple nationally representative interview surveys con-
ducted in the United States (12­20). Previous studies based
on the National Health Interview Survey indicated that the
prevalence of self-reported hearing loss in adults rose some-
time in the 1970s and 1980s and remained stable between
1986 and 1995 (17, 18). Although self-reported measures
are attractive because of relatively low costs and ease of
administration, they may not accurately quantify true levels
of hearing (11, 21, 22). Moreover, question wording on
hearing loss has varied across surveys and even within some

surveys over time. The lack of consistency in eliciting self-
reported hearing status makes it challenging to assess long-
term trends in the prevalence of hearing loss among adults in
the United States.
In this study, we use partial data on audiometric testing to
examine and correct for biases in self-reports on hearing and
develop valid estimates of levels and trends in the prevalence
of bilateral hearing loss among US adults from 1976 to 2006.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were obtained from interviews and examinations in
4 nationally representative survey series conducted between
1976 and 2006 in the United States: the Medical Expendi-
ture Panel Survey (MEPS), 1996­2005 (23); the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES),
1976­1980 (II), 1988­1994 (III), 1999­2000, 2001­2002,
and 2003­2004 (IV) (24); the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS), 1978­2006 (25); and the Survey of Income
and Program Participation (SIPP), 1984­2004 (26). All of
these surveys were conducted on stratified multistage prob-
ability samples of the civilian noninstitutionalized popula-
tion in the United States. A summary of the data sources is
provided in Table 1.
Measured data were obtained from the pure-tone air con-
duction audiometry performed in 3 cycles of NHANES IV,
in 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004. In each survey,
half of the sample of adults aged 20­69 years were ran-
domly selected for testing. Participants were excluded from
audiometric tests if they wore hearing aids and could not
remove them for testing or if they had ear pain and could not
tolerate headphones. The eligible sample size was 1,807 in
1999­2000, 2,046 in 2000­2001, and 1,889 in 2003­2004
(24). Procedures for collecting the audiometric data have
been detailed elsewhere (10). In summary, an audiometry test
was performed by trained personnel in a sound-isolated room
in the mobile examination center. Hearing threshold testing
was conducted on both ears of examinees at 7 frequencies
(0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 kHz).
According to the classification by the World Health
Organization, measured bilateral hearing loss was defined
in this study as a value greater than 25 dB of the pure-tone
average of audiometric hearing thresholds at the speech
frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz in the better ear (27).
To be consistent with the definitions for measured hearing,
self-reported bilateral hearing loss was defined as use of
hearing aids in both ears or decreased hearing in the better
ear. The definitions of self-reported hearing loss in this study
are detailed for each survey in Table 2.
The total sample size used in this analysis was 990,609.
Sample sizes of individual surveys by age and sex are given
in Table 3. Of the 5,742 respondents eligible for inclusion in
the audiometry examination of NHANES IV, 324 (6%) were
excluded from analysis because a test was not done at all,
and 119 (2%) were excluded because of missing values. The
final sample size with audiometric measurements was 5,299,
accounting for 0.5% of the entire pooled sample.
As a preliminary descriptive analysis, the prevalence of
measured or self-reported hearing loss among people aged
20­69 years was computed directly from individual surveys
by sex and year to characterize variation in prevalence esti-
mates across surveys.
Next, unit record data of all surveys were merged to in-
vestigate differences in self-reports due to variation in

question wording across surveys. A logistic regression
model was applied, in which the dependent variable was
a dichotomous measure of self-reported or measured hear-
ing loss, and independent variables were age (continuous),
year of survey (reference ¼ 1997), and indicator variables
for specific surveys (reference ¼ NHANES audiometric
tests). Odds ratios for survey indicator variables represent
the bias in self-reported measures of hearing loss relative to
the reference standard of audiometric measurement. For
NHIS and SIPP, which underwent changes in survey design
and item wording, separate survey indicator variables were
included for the periods before and after the change. Table 1
presents how years were assigned to individual surveys.
Years in NHANES were determined by the midpoint of each
time period (1978 in NHANES II; 1990 and 1993 in the first
and second phases, respectively, of NHANES III) or by the
first year in each 2-year cycle in NHANES IV (1999, 2001,
and 2003). Years in SIPP were defined by years of survey
implementation rather than the starting years of the panels.
Separate regressions were run by sex and for 3 different age
groups, defined as 20­49, 50­59, and 60­69 years, to elab-
orate how patterns in self-reporting errors vary among these
groups.
Regression coefficients were used to compute prevalence
by sex and single year of age, for each calendar year between
1976 and 2006, with the survey variable held at the reference
value (i.e., NHANES audiometric examination) to exclude
systematic biases in self-reported values. Age-standardized
prevalence estimates were based on the 2000 US population
(28). Confidence intervals were calculated for prevalence es-
timates by statistical simulation to account for estimation
uncertainty (29). For each regression model, 1,000 sets
of sampled coefficients were drawn from a multivariate

variance throughout the analyses by incorporating information
on sampling weights, stratification, and clustering.
RESULTS
Figure 1 presents age-standardized prevalence of bilateral
hearing loss at speech frequencies by sex, estimated from
individual surveys. The estimates of prevalence were sub-
stantially different across surveys in both sexes. Prior to
1997, the prevalence obtained from SIPP was considerably
lower than those in NHIS and NHANES. For example, the
prevalence estimate in men in 1993 was 5.8% (95% confi-
dence interval (CI): 5.4, 6.3) in SIPP, while it was 15.1%
(95% CI: 13.2, 17.2) in NHANES and 12.3% (95% CI: 11.4,
13.3) in NHIS. The discrepancies between surveys have
become more marked since 1997, with the redesign of NHIS
and the addition of MEPS and continuous NHANES exam-
ination surveys. For instance, the prevalence in men in 1999
was estimated to be 7.5% (95% CI: 6.8, 8.3) in MEPS,
25.9% (95% CI: 22.5, 29.6) in the NHANES interview,
7.8% (95% CI: 5.6, 10.7) in the NHANES examination,
and 16.2% (95% CI: 15.4, 17.1) in NHIS. The redesign of
NHIS produced a discernible discontinuity in the prevalence
of self-reported hearing loss, while the impact of changes in
SIPP was apparently more subtle.
Tables 4 and 5 show odds ratios of reporting hearing loss
for specific interview surveys relative to the NHANES IV
audiometric tests. The direction and magnitude of biases in
self-reports in the different surveys were relatively consistent
between men (Table 4) and women (Table 5). Overreporting
of hearing loss compared with audiometry was statistically
significant and substantial in NHANES IV interview surveys
in all age-sex groups and in NHIS (1997­2006) ages 20­49
and 50­59 years, in both sexes. The likelihood of overreport-
ing in these 2 surveys was highest in those aged 20­49 years
and attenuated with rising age. Significant overreporting of
hearing loss in ages 20­49 years also appeared in NHANES
III in both sexes and in NHIS (1978­1996) in women only.
On the other hand, SIPP showed significant underreporting of
hearing loss relative to audiometry in both periods of
1984­1993 and 1997­2005, at ages 50­59 and 60­69 years
in both sexes. Significant underreporting was also detected in
MEPS, NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHIS (1978­1996)
among respondents of both sexes aged 60­69 years.
Figure 2 shows the estimated trends in the age-standardized
prevalence of bilateral hearing loss at the speech frequencies
by sex among US adults aged 20­69 years after biases
in self-reports were corrected on the basis of measured au-
diometric data. The prevalence of bilateral hearing loss in
men shifted from 9.6% (95% CI: 7.7, 11.8) in 1978 to 12.2%
(95% CI: 10.1, 14.7) in 1993, subsequently declined to 8.1%
(95% CI: 7.0, 9.5) in 2000, and remained relatively constant
at approximately 8%­9% until 2006. Among women, the
age-standardized prevalence of bilateral hearing loss moved
from 6.1% (95% CI: 4.7, 7.8) in 1978 to 7.0% (95% CI: 5.5,
9.1) in 1993, then decreased to 4.2% (95% CI: 3.4, 5.3) in
2000, and remained at approximately 4%­5% until 2006.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide com-
parable estimates of long-term trends in the prevalence of
hearing loss among US adults from the late 1970s to the early
2000s. Our study indicates that the prevalence of bilateral
hearing loss at the speech frequencies in US adults declined
in the 1990s and stabilized in the early 2000s. We also dem-
onstrate that biases in self-reported hearing measures vary
substantially across different survey instruments and move
in different directions according to the age of respondents.
The estimated trends in the prevalence of bilateral hearing
loss in this analysis agree with previous findings that studied

earlier periods (17, 18, 30). A unique contribution of the
present study is to overcome differences in measurement
methods across time periods and surveys in order to link
these past trends to more recent measurements. Such explicit
connections are complicated by the redesign of NHIS in 1997
and the lack of audiometric testing results in past periods, but
our study uses regression methods to make full use of avail-
able data and to enable adjustment and comparison of self-
reports by leveraging audiometric testing data from more
recent years.

Previous studies indicated that self-reports may underes-
timate the prevalence of hearing loss (11, 21, 22). We found
that directions and patterns of bias varied by the wording
and response scales of survey instruments. Overreporting of
hearing loss is particularly pronounced in NHANES IV self-
reports--as observed previously (11)--and in NHIS after
1997. These findings might be partly attributable to the
use of a scaled response question, presumably resulting in
worse accuracy against audiometry than self-reports based
on ``yes''/``no'' questions. Another possible factor is the
lack of specification of which ear in the question. In these
surveys, a substantial fraction of people reported mildly

trouble''), which might have included individuals with uni-
lateral hearing loss. One explanation for the underreporting
of hearing loss in SIPP is that the question relating to hear-
ing a normal conversation did not easily accommodate the
``slight impairment,'' i.e., inability to hear whispers, refer-
enced in the World Health Organization classification (27).
People who have problems in hearing whispers might not
report the impairment if they could hear a normal conver-
sation with another person.
Another key finding of our study is that biases in self-
reports may vary systematically with age. The likelihood of
reporting hearing loss relative to audiometric tests attenuates
with increasing age. A possible interpretation is that expect-
ations for hearing decline with advancing age, which makes
older individuals less likely than younger ones to report hear-
ing loss. The large sample sizes in this study allowed us to
estimate separate regressions by age group in order to char-
acterize these varying patterns. If our approach were applied
to smaller data sets, pooling across age groups might be
necessary for statistical power, which would add some con-
straints to the types of inference that could be made.
A previous study has proposed tracking population health
over time by using data on self-reported symptoms and
impairments from nationally representative surveys in the
United States (31). Our results on survey-specific biases in
self-reported hearing status reinforce the need for caution in
interpreting and comparing self-reports in different surveys.
Nevertheless, our findings indicate that partial data on mea-
sured performance may be exploited successfully to correct
for these differences. This approach may have general utility
for enhancing the comparability of various health impair-
ments and symptoms measured with self-reports and, thus,
for improving the validity of monitoring long-term trends in
population health.
Our analysis has various limitations that should be noted.
First, the survey samples exclude military personnel, resi-
dents in institutions, and individuals aged 70 or more years,
which may result in an underestimate of hearing loss preva-
lence. Second, our model assumes that biases in self-reported
hearing loss are constant over time within any given survey
(barring changes in survey methods or items). This assump-
tion will be overly restrictive if expectations have shifted over
the duration of a particular survey's implementation. Further
accumulation of data including audiometric measurements
would enable empirical testing of this assumption based on
more flexible models. Meanwhile, the fact that identical ques-
tion wording was preserved within each survey provides
some reassurance that this simplifying assumption may be
reasonable.
From a public health perspective, several plausible hypoth-
eses on the causes of declines in the prevalence of hearing
loss in the 1990s might warrant further empirical investiga-
tion. One explanation might be decreased incidence of noise-
induced hearing loss. Noise was reported to be the most
frequent cause of hearing impairment in US adults aged less
than 65 years in the early 1990s (17). Under occupational
noise regulations, exposures to hazardous levels of noise de-
creased, and the use of hearing protection devices increased
in the manufacturing and coal mining sectors (32, 33). Given
that hearing loss is still highly prevalent in the industrial
sectors involving hazardous noise (34), however, further cor-
porate and governmental efforts at hearing conservation
might be beneficial. Another possible explanation for de-
creased prevalence of hearing loss during the 1990s is im-
provement in screening and use of hearing aids, although to
our knowledge there is no evidence that detection and treat-
ment of hearing impairment increased dramatically during
the period.
Estimates of the prevalence of hearing loss from self-
report must be evaluated with caution because of differential
biases across age groups and surveys. However, correction
of these biases is possible if audiometric measurements are
available from at least 1 survey, and if survey periods par-
tially overlap with each other. Hearing loss remains an im-
portant public health problem in the United States.
Following the decline in the prevalence of bilateral hearing
loss at the speech frequencies during the 1990s, more recent
trends have been stable in both adult men and women. Fur-
ther strategies to promote prevention of hearing loss at work
and in communities may be needed to resume progress in
reducing the burden of hearing loss.
