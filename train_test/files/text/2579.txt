Background: As populations age, cognitive decline and dementia pose significant burdens for societies and
health care systems, including low- and middle-income countries such as Mexico. Minor age-related declines
in cognitive function appear to represent a stable but heterogeneous phase in the continuum between normal
cognitive ageing and dementia. Loss of cognitive function has impacts at societal and individual levels and
understanding the risk factors can help provide a framework for health policies and interventions to target
at-risk groups.
Design: A cohort of older Mexican adults (50') from the World Health Organization's Study on global
AGEing and adult health (WHO SAGE) was used to examine cognitive function, including a total of 2315
respondents, with 325 respondents aged 80 years and older. Cognition was objectively evaluated using verbal
recall, verbal fluency, forward digit span and backward digit span, with differences in an overall cognitive
score assessed against sociodemographic variables, and associated factors using linear regression.
Results: The most significant predictors of poorer cognitive function were found to be older age
(b0(13.88), rural living (b0(2.25), low income (b0(8.28), self-reported severe or extreme memory
difficulties (b0(6.62), and difficulty with two or more activities of daily living (b0(2.02).
Conclusions: These findings can inform public health initiatives to address cognitive impairment in ageing
populations in Mexico and other middle-income countries.

Introduction
Dementia and cognitive impairment are significant
sources of morbidity in ageing populations around the
world, including middle-income countries such as
Mexico. Mexico is the fifth largest country in the
Americas with a population over 120 million, and a life
expectancy of 80 years for women and 75 for men; almost
20% are expected to be aged 60 and older by 2030 (1).
Overall, developing countries currently carry 58% of the
world's dementia burden and this is projected to rise to
71% by 2050 (2). Mexico has a high incidence rate of
dementia (30.4 per 1,000 person-years) in those aged 65
and older, when compared to other countries in the Latin
American region (3), and is estimated to affect 6Á8% of
those aged 60 years (4, 5). Dementia, which includes
Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body and frontotemporal
dementias, and vascular dementia, results from a number
of pathological processes and is preceded by changes in
cognition that differ from the normal ageing process.
Mild changes in cognition can manifest as delays in
memory and impairments in complex activities of daily
living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living
(IADLs) (6, 7). More significant cognitive impairment
would be characterised by considerable disability and
neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression and
anxiety (8), often resulting in high caregiving needs (9).

In Mexico, estimates are 3Á29% for mild cognitive
impairment for those aged over 60 years (10, 11),
compared to a general estimate of 10Á20% in older adult
populations (6).
The evidence on risk factors for dementia is growing,
with the strongest evidence currently available for advan-
cing age, low education levels in early life, tobacco use,
diabetes, and midlife hypertension (12Á14), and may be
explained in part by the effect of education on cognitive
reserve (15) or changes in brain structure and function due
to vascular disease (16). In Mexican populations, reported
risk factors for mild impairments in cognition include
older age, sex, education, depression, heart disease, and
diabetes (10, 11). As ageing populations are growing
worldwide, groups at highest risk for cognitive decline,
particularly those from low- and middle-income countries,
can be targeted as part of wider efforts to reduce the
prevalence of dementia and its burden on society and
healthcare systems. This paper examined risk factors for
cognitive impairment amongst a sample of adults aged
50 years and older in a population-based study in Mexico.
Methods
Population and sample
The sample of respondents aged 50' years from the
World Health Organization's Study on global AGEing
and adult health (WHO SAGE) Mexico Wave 1 (2009Á
2010) was used for this study. SAGE is a longitudinal
study of health and well-being in adults from six low- and
middle-income countries, including Mexico. Stratified
multistage clustered sampling (1) was used to generate a
final sample of 2,756 respondents in Mexico. The study
design included samples of follow-up respondents from
SAGE Wave 0, a baseline cohort created during the
2002Á2004 World Health Survey, and new respondents.
Proxy respondents were identified for respondents who
were unable to provide reliable responses or due to poor
health. Face-to-face interviews were conducted in Mexico
between 2009 and 2010. Cross-sectional data from SAGE
Wave 1 were used in this study. More information on
WHO SAGE is available elsewhere (17). SAGE was
approved by the Ethics Review Committee of the World
Health Organization and by the Ethics Committee of
the National Institute of Public Health in Cuernavaca,
Mexico.
Measures
SAGE evaluates self-reported perceptions of health, well-
being, and cognition, and also assesses these using more
objective measures, including a battery of cognitive tests
(immediate and delayed verbal recall, VR; verbal fluency,
VF; forward digit span, FDS; and backward digit span,
BDS), and a 4-metre (4-m) timed walk at both normal and
rapid pace.
Verbal memory was tested using verbal recall, consisting
of three repetitions of a 10-word list for immediate recall,
and then assessing the recall of these words after a 10-min
delay. The verbal fluency test consisted of naming as many
animals as possible in 1 min, to assess attention, semantic
memory, and executive functions. Digit span was used to
assess memory capacity and executive function, using both
forward and backward digit recall tests (18). An overall
composite cognitive score, used to characterise cognitive
function, was calculated by standardising and summing
the correct responses from immediate and delayed VR, VF,
FDS, and BDS, and rescaling these to a value between
0 and 100, where 0 is the worst and 100 is the best score for
cognition (19).
Covariates included a number of sociodemographic
variables such as age, sex, urban/rural locality of residence
and asset-based income quintiles. Age was recategorised
into four age groups: 50Á59, 60Á69, 70Á79, and 80'.
Other predictors included: self-report of difficulties with
memory (`Overall in the last 30 days, how much difficulty
did you have with concentrating or remembering things?'),
difficulties with ADLs (including questions on eating,
walking, climbing stairs, concentrating, bathing, getting
dressed) and IADLs (including questions on household
care, daily work, using public transport), timed normal
gait speed over a 4 m distance (slow gait was considered to
be B1 m/s (20) with gait speeds B0.13 m/s and !4 m/s
excluded). Prevalence of stroke and hypertension was
based on self-report using a form of the question: `Have
you ever been told by a health professional that you have
[disease/condition]?'. Depression was measured using an
algorithm based on diagnosis and symptoms (including
questions on medication/therapy, sadness, loss of interest,
low energy) and based on the World Mental Health
Survey's version of the Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview (21). Use of tobacco was based on the
question: `Do you currently use (smoke, sniff or chew)
any tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars, pipes,
chewing tobacco or snuff?'. Tobacco use for this analysis
included daily and non-daily use. Alcohol use was based on
the question: `Have you consumed alcohol in the last 30
days?'.
Statistical analysis
Data were analysed in STATA (MP13). Post-stratification
analysis weights were applied. Bivariate associations
between predictors and the outcome variable (overall
cognitive score) were assessed using linear regression.
Reference groups were: 50Á59 age group, male gender,
urban locality, lowest income percentile, no self-reported
difficulty with memory, no difficulty with any of the six
ADLs, no difficulty with IADLs, slow gait speed (B1 m/s),
no depression, no stroke, no hypertension, no tobacco use,
and no alcohol use. Variables associated with cognition at
pB0.1 were then included in a multiple linear regression

analysis and reduced stepwise until only factors with
pB0.05 remained.
Results
Of the 2,315 respondents, 19% were aged 50Á59, 41% were
aged 60Á69, 27% were aged 70Á79, and 14% were 80'
years old (Table 1, unweighted data). Men made up 40% of
respondents and 73% of respondents lived in urban areas.
A large proportion of people reported having memory
difficulties in the past 30 days (53%) and difficulties in
ADLs (45%); only 16% reported difficulties with IADLs.
Respondents predominantly walked at a gait slower than 1
m/s (85%). Thirteen percent ofolder adults had a historyof
depression, 5% reported having had a stroke, and 39%
reported hypertension. Fifty-two percent reported current
tobacco use and 28% had consumed alcohol in the past
30 days.
In the bivariate analysis, significant negative associa-
tions were found between lower cognitive score (poorer
cognitive function) and higher age (pB0.001), rural living
(pB0.001), increasing difficulty with memory (pB0.001),
increasing difficulty with ADLs (pB0.001), and IADLs
(pB0.001), and those diagnosed with hypertension
(p00.013) (Table 1, weighted data). Positive associations
were observed for income percentile (pB0.001), faster gait
speed (pB0.001), current tobacco use (pB0.001), and
alcohol use in the past 30 days (pB0.001) (Table 1,
weighted data). Sex, depression, and stroke were not
significantly associated with the calculated composite
cognitive score.
Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that, after
adjusting for confounding factors, poorer global cognitive
functioning was significantly associated with age (!80,
b0(13.88, pB0.001), locality (rural living, b0(2.25,

difficulties with memory (severe/extreme, b0(6.62,
pB0.01), and ADLs (2', b0(2.02, pB0.05) as well
as no reported alcohol consumption (b0(2.22,
pB0.001) (Table 2, weighted data), suggesting that both
modifiable and non-modifiable factors contribute to
cognitive function.
Discussion
Impaired cognitive function is becoming an important
source of morbidity as populations age, with cognitive
changes and dementia representing significant burdens in
Mexico (3Á5, 10, 11). Understanding the population at
greatest risk can lead to targeted interventions and more
effective use of limited health resources in Mexico and
similar developing countries (14). In this study, lower
cognitive functioning was strongly associated with ad-
vancing age, rural living and lower income, as well as with
subjective memory complaints and ADL limitations.
These findings compare with other SAGE publications
examining cognition in Ghana, Tanzania, India (18),
South Africa (22), and China (23), where poorer cogni-
tive function was observed in those of advancing age,
rural living, lower education, and wealth levels, and
poorer subjective health status, including deterioration
in ADLs and slower gait. Subjective losses in memory
and daily functioning and its association with poorer
cognition have been described as features of mild
cognitive impairment (6, 7), and testing these along
with gait speed (24) may aid the early detection of those
at high risk of dementia and provide a point for successful
interventions.
Comorbidities, such as hypertension, also indicated a
higher risk for poorer cognitive functioning in this study,
but thiswas not observed for a historyof stroke as shown in
previous studies in the Mexican population (10, 11).
Although evidence suggests a role for vascular disease in

cognitive changes as a result of changes in brain structure
and function (16), epidemiological evidence in studies
involving Mexican and MexicanÁAmerican populations is
inconsistent in regards to the precise relationship between
cognitive function and hypertension and stroke. Hyperten-
sion may be a stronger predictor of dementia (10) rather
than cognitive impairment (11, 25) and this study did not
include a measure of hypertension in midlife, the factor
with, perhaps, the strongest evidence (26). There also is a
lack of causal evidence between cognition and stroke, as
both have been described on the causal pathway in
MexicanÁAmerican populations (25, 27). Similarly, de-
pression may (28), or may not (25) be associated with
cognitive changes.
Modifiable factors such as tobacco and alcohol use did
not have a negative association with cognitive function,
perhaps because the duration and quantity of use were not
quantified in these regressions. Approximately 33% of
tobacco users were not daily smokers (data not shown).
While tobacco is generally associated with poorer cogni-
tive functioning (13, 29), as it is a known risk factor
for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease (30), some
studies have not shown an association (31). These
differences are attributed to survivorship bias in large
epidemiologic studies (32). Similarly, while alcohol in
moderation has been shown to be protective (29, 33) other
studies have shown no association with cognitive decline
(13). This may reflect the positive and negative effects of
alcohol on the cardiovascular system (33), resulting in a
relationship described as U-shaped. Alcohol consumption
also was not quantified for this analysis but of the
respondents who reported use in the past 30 days, 54%
had consumed less than one standard drink in the past
month (data not shown).
This study describes for the first time associations
between various demographic and modifiable risk factors
and global measures of cognitive function in a representa-
tive sample of the older adult Mexican population,
building upon a previous study examining incidence rates
of dementia and cognitive impairment (10). Strengths of
this study include the large-scale cross-sectional data,
including the collection of objective measurements, with
the potential to follow up on individual data with future
survey waves. Comparisons also can be made across a
number of low- and middle-income countries that are
participating in WHO SAGE. Weaknesses include the lack
of causality, the use of subjective rather than objective
measures including self-report on some disease conditions,
missing data particularly on self-reporting which can bias
these findings, and the exclusion of dementia data. These
findings can inform public health initiatives in Mexico, for
example, the current Over 70s Allowance, the 70'
Program, or Prospera an intervention for those living in
poverty (1), to address wider issues involving ageing
populations by increasing education and supporting
memory (34), or improving vascular health, to reduce the
burden of cognitive impairment.
