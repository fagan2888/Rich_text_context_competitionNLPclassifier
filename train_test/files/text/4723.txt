Introduction
Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms in the
general population. Studies have shown that 33percent of
the general population has experienced chest pain at least
once (Eslick et al., 2003). A Norwegian study showed that
86
percent of patients referred to a cardiac medical out-
patient clinic for an initial evaluation of chest pain did not
have any evidence of coronary artery disease (Dammen,
2002). Most of these patients are sent home with the assur-
ance that there is nothing wrong with the heart. However,
studies have shown that 47
percent of patients with non-
cardiac diagnoses still experienced chest pain 5
months
after their cardiac evaluation, and more than 50percent of
these patients were not convinced by their negative cardiac
diagnosis (Dumville et al., 2007). A follow-up study of
patients who had received reassurance that they were at
very low risk of cardiac disease after a full assessment by a
chest pain observation unit (including exercise stress test-
ing) found that 33
percent reported that they still worried
about their chest pain 1month after assessment (Goodacre
et al., 2001). These findings may indicate that a large pro-
portion of patients who experience non-cardiac chest pain
(NCCP) are not reassured and continue to be worried by
their chest pain. It is important to mention that the term
NCCP means that the pain is of a non-cardiac origin and
that it includes other different etiologies, such as musculo-
skeletal, gastrointestinal, and psychological causes (Fass
and Achem, 2011). That many in this patient group con-
tinue to experience pain and worry about cardiac causes of
their pain, despite comprehensive medical examination that
shows there is no cardiac cause, is a well-documented phe-
nomenon (Dumville et al., 2007; Robertson et al., 2008). It
is pertinent to add that NCCP often results in high health-
care resource utilization (Fass and Achem, 2011).
Several factors may influence the individuals' experi-
ence of chest pain. According to Turk's biopsychosocial
model, pain can be modulated by the patient's personality,
emotional state, and method of coping with symptoms.
Moreover, how patients interpret their symptoms and their
expectations about the meaning of their symptoms contrib-
ute to their subjective experience and report of pain (Turk
and Okifuji, 1999). Because of the large number of indi-
viduals who seek medical assistance for their NCCP, fac-
tors that influence the experience of symptoms need to be

Abstract
The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship of emotional instability with illness worry and perceived
limitations due to chest pain, and investigate to what degree any associations are mediated by the following chest pain­
related coping styles: acceptance, seeking emotional support, seeking instrumental support, and avoidance. Self-reported
measures from 94 participants with non-cardiac chest pain were collected. The results showed a relationship between
emotional instability, illness worry, and perceived limitations due to chest pain. Moreover, this relationship was mediated
by the coping styles avoidance and acceptance.

identified. It is well known that personality factors can
influence a person's perception of symptoms (Watson and
Pennebaker, 1989). There is also evidence indicating that
the personality characteristics of emotional instability,
which in this study is used synonymously with neuroticism,
are linked to the experience of bodily symptoms (Costa and
McCrae, 1985; De Gucht et al., 2004; Watson and
Pennebaker, 1989). The emotional stability­instability
dimension refers to the variation in individuals' disposition
to experience situations or bodily sensations as benign or
pleasant versus threatening or distressing. Individuals with
a higher score on emotional instability are found to be more
likely to experience somatic symptoms and interpret these
as more threatening compared to emotionally stable indi-
viduals (Costa and McCrae, 1987). More emotionally insta-
ble persons may be predisposed to extensive illness worry,
which is likely to lead to increased pain-related limitations.
Previous research in non-clinical samples has indicated that
emotional instability is associated with worries and bodily
symptoms (Rosmalen et al., 2007), but to our knowledge
there have been no studies that have investigated the asso-
ciations between emotional instability, illness worry, and
perceived limitations due to pain in NCCP patients.
Therefore, an important aim of this study was to investigate
the association of emotional instability with illness worry
and perceived limitations due to chest pain (PLCP) among
people with a non-cardiac diagnosis.
Emotional instability may influence the perception and
understanding of pain indirectly by affecting the use of cop-
ing styles. There is substantial evidence indicating that
emotional instability is linked to less adequate coping strat-
egies. Findings from a meta-analysis of the relationships
between personality and coping revealed that emotional
instability is related to less use of problem-focused coping
and acceptance but more emotion-focused coping and sup-
port seeking (Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007).
Stress and lack of perceived control are found to be
important morbidity factors in a previous study among
NCCP patients (Rosenbaum et al., 2012). Living with
chronic chest pain may generate overwhelming stressors
for the individual and, in turn, create significant challenges
in terms of adaptive coping demands. Turk's biopsychoso-
cial model of pain indicates that coping can modulate pain.
However, limited attention has been given to how coping
styles as factors can influence pain perception among peo-
ple with NCCP and how the individuals' coping styles may
mediate the link between emotional instability and the
experience or interpretation of chest pain symptoms.
Knowledge about how coping styles may mediate this link
could help target interventions.
There is some empirical support for the existence of sev-
eral primary dimensions of coping. These dimensions can
be organized into two higher-order categories: engagement
and disengagement coping. Disengagement coping involves
disengaging the individual from the person/environment
transaction (Tobin et al., 1989). Previous research shows
that emotional instability is positively related to disengage-
ment coping (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010). In NCCP
patients, disengagement coping are likely to imply different
forms of avoidance in order to avoid the experience of pain
or heart attack. However, instead of relief from pain, avoid-
ance coping are likely to deprive the person from learning
that they can carry out also physically strenuous activities
without experiencing pain, and thus result in maintained
worry and perceived physical limitations. On the other
hand, engagement coping implies that individuals engage
in active efforts to control, manage, or change stressful cir-
cumstances as well as to manage emotional responses to
the stressor (Tobin et al., 1989). Support seeking and
acceptance are coping styles included in engagement cop-
ing (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010).
Acceptance of the life situation including the possibility
of experiencing pain could reduce worry and improve how
the individual deals with the experience of pain (Carver
et al., 1989). Previous research suggests that this type of
acceptance is particularly difficult for people with NCCP
(Dumville et al., 2007) and that this may be one reason why
they continue to worry about their health and the experi-
ence of chest pain. Moreover, accepting the possibility of
experiencing pain and avoiding a strong focus on the pos-
sibility of pain are likely to be more difficult for people
with higher scores on emotional instability (Carver and
Connor-Smith, 2010).
Seeking support is another important form of engagement
coping. Support, both from family and health services, is
usually used to obtain information and to interpret symptoms
positively. From this perspective, seeking support could con-
tribute to a decrease in illness worry and improve the ability
to carry out daily activities despite the possibility of experi-
encing chest pain. However, seeking support may also reflect
increased concerns about what the experienced bodily symp-
toms may indicate, and could increase the likelihood that
some individuals continue to worry about their chest pain. In
that regard, it is relevant to note that emotional instability is
found to be linked to more seeking of emotional support
(Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010). Yet, a previous meta-
analysis suggests that emotional instability, on average, is
unrelated to coping by the seeking of social support (Connor-
Smith and Flachsbart, 2007). The role of support seeking in
the experience of chest pain among NCCP patients is poorly
understood and therefore important to explore.
Aims of the study
The main aim of this study was to (1) examine the relation-
ship of emotional instability with illness worry and PLCP
and (2) investigate to what degree any associations are
mediated by the following chest pain­related coping styles:
acceptance, seeking emotional support, seeking instrumen-
tal support, and avoidance.

Methods
This study was conducted in an out-patient cardiac clinic in
a city in Norway and is part of a larger longitudinal study. It
was approved by the Norwegian Regional Ethic Committee
(reference no. 2009/2243) and conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. All the participants volun-
teered and were able to withdraw at any time.
Subjects and recruitment
All patients who were referred to an out-patient clinic for an
investigation of new onset chest pain were invited to partici-
pate in this study. Inclusion criteria were the following: (1)
new onset, non-acute chest pain; (2) age more than 18years;
(3) ability to read and communicate in Norwegian; and (4)
ability to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria were the
following: (1) previously diagnosed with heart disease, (2)
no symptoms of chest pain, (3) cardiac investigation as part
of pre-surgical procedure, (4) pregnancy, (5) participation in
other studies, and (6) life-threatening disease.
A total of 282 patients were recruited; 59 were excluded
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria or because they
missed their appointment. In all, 115 patients (of 223)
refused to participate (51.4%). The number of patients
included in this study was 108 (48.6%). Of these patients, 4
had a positive test result, and 10 had an inconclusive test
result. The sample for this study included 94 participants,
and all had a negative test result. The response rate is a
challenge among NCCP patients, but the response rate in
this study is in line with that of other studies conducted
among this group of patients (Kisely et al., 2012).
The employees in the clinic recruited the patients based
on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients
received information about the study and a questionnaire
together with an appointment at the cardiac investigation.
The questionnaire had to be completed before the appoint-
ment and was collected at the visit. The employees at the
clinic were called to remind them about the study 2­5days
before their appointment. When they arrived, they were
once again checked against the inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria, and written informed consent was collected. They all
underwent both echocardiogram and electrocardiogram
(ECG)-stress test as a part of the investigation. Before they
left the clinic, they received the results of the tests and
answered five questions about the extent to which they had
been reassured. The characteristics of the patients are pre-
sented in Table 1. The mean duration of chest pain was
17months, ranging from 1 to 96months.
Measures
PLCP.To measure the patients' PLCP, eight items from
The Medical Outcomes Study Pain Measurement (McDow-
ell, 2006) and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (Spertus
et al., 1995) were selected. The participants were asked to
indicate the extent of limitations they had experienced due
to chest pain during the previous 4weeks. Items concerned
limitations regarding various daily activities, and how the
pain had affected their sleep and mood. The items were
rated on a 5-point scale, from 1=not at all to 5=extremely,
and were answered before the appointment. Factor analyses
with principle axis extraction and eigenvalue set to 1.0 for
these items resulted in a one factor solution that accounted
for 57.3percent of variance in items. Results from the fac-
tor analysis indicate that the items included in the scale
measuring PLCP assess a uniform concept. Cronbach's 
for the scale was .88.
Illness worry. To investigate chest pain­related worries, we
used two items from the Reassurance Questionnaire
(Donkin et al., 2006) and one item from the Brief Illness
Perception Questionnaire (Broadbent et al., 2006). The
scale based on these three items yielded high internal con-
sistency (=.89), and a factor analysis with eigenvalue set
to 1.0 gave a one factor solution (explained vari-
ance
=
82.5%), indicating that the scale measured a uni-
form concept. The items included were as follows: (1)
"How worried are you about your health?" (2) "To what
extent do you believe you have a serious illness?" and (3)
"How concerned are you about your chest pain?"1 All of
these items were rated on a 10-point scale, ranging from
0=not at all to 10=very much, and were answered before
the appointment.
Emotional instability. Emotional instability was assessed by
using the neuroticism subscale from the Eysenck Personal-
ity Questionnaire (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1975). This scale
consists of 22 items and is scored according to a yes­no
format. Scoring range is 22­44, a higher score indicating
more emotional instability. Cronbach's  of the scale for the
sample used in this study was .88.
Coping.Chest pain­related coping styles were assessed
using four subscales from the COPE Scale (Carver et al.,

1989): Acceptance, Seeking Instrumental Support, Seeking
Emotional Support, and Disengagement. The subscale for
Disengagement was modified to suit the context of this
study, two items were removed, and a new item was added.
The items included in this subscale were the following:
"I've avoided activities that can lead to chest pain," "I've
given up trying to live a normal life," and "I have become
less active due to chest pain." This shifted the content of this
scale toward coping by avoidance, and the included meas-
ure was therefore labeledAvoidance. The introduction to the
scale on coping was modified to relate the items to coping
with chest pain. Additionally, some items were modified to
assure that coping-related chest pain was assessed. The orig-
inal response alternatives were used, and items were scored
on a 4-point scale ranging from 1=never to 4=often.
A factor analysis yielded a four factor solution that was in
accordance with the intended grouping of items but sug-
gested that one item from instrumental support should be
included in the subscale for emotional support. However, the
original solution from Carver et al. (1989) was chosen. The
factor analysis with principle axis extraction and the number
of factors set to four accounted for 67.9
percent of the total
variance. The explained variances and Cronbach's s for the
factor-based indexes were as follows: Seeking Instrumental
Support: 7.1percent, 
=
.73; Seeking Emotional Support:
31percent, =.81; Acceptance: 19.7percent, =.88; and
Avoidance: 10.1percent, =.73.
Control variables. Previous research on NCCP showed that
those who sought treatment had higher rates of NCCP, were
more likely to be women, were younger, and had higher
levels of self-reported anxiety (Huffman and Pollack,
2003). Therefore, age and gender were included as control
variables. Gender was coded: 1=women and 2=men.
Procedures and statistical analyses
Data were collected from 2012 to 2013 by using self-report.
IBM SPSS version 21.0 software was used to conduct the
statistical analyses (SPSS, 2012). The selected statistical
procedures were descriptive analyses, reliability testing
(Cronbach's ), factor analysis, product­moment correla-
tions, and multiple regression analysis. Path analysis was
conducted by performing three multiple regression analy-
ses in which the variables for chest pain­related coping
styles, illness worry, and PLCP were regressed on the vari-
ables to the left in the path model depicted in Figure 1. The
missing values varied from 0 to 6.5 percent. The missing
values were replaced with the mean score for the variable.
Results
The bivariate relationships between the variables are given
in Table 2. Scores for Emotional instability were moder-
ately to strongly positively correlated with scores for Illness
worry and PLCP. Emotional instability also showed signifi-
cant positive associations with scores for Avoidance and
Seeking Emotional Support and a negative correlation with
Acceptance. The strongest bivariate correlations were com-
puted for the associations of Seeking Emotional Support
with Seeking Instrumental Support, Avoidance with PLCP,
and Illness worry with PLCP. Moreover, correlational anal-
ysis revealed tendencies for older patients and women to
have lower scores on Illness worry and Avoidance.

The results from the path analysis are given in Figure 1.
Age and gender were controlled for in the analyses. The
results from the path analysis showed that most of the asso-
ciations of Emotional instability with Illness worry and
PLCP were mediated by coping styles. The link from
Emotional instability to PLCP via Avoidance yielded the
strongest indirect association. The results reflected a ten-
dency for those with high scores for emotional instability to
report more avoidance, which in turn was associated with
more illness worry and PLCP. Moreover, there was a mod-
erate tendency for high scores on Emotional instability to
be associated with low scores for Acceptance, which in turn
was related to lower scores on Illness worry. Variables
assessing the seeking of support did not mediate the rela-
tionship between Emotional instability and Illness worry
and PLCP. The regression equation accounted for 52
per-
cent of the variance in PLCP.
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have
investigated the associations between emotional instability,
coping styles, illness worry, and PLCP in NCCP patients.
This study might therefore provide new and important
information about the role of emotional instability and cop-
ing styles in NCCP.
The results from the correlation analyses showed mod-
erate to strong relationships between Emotional instability
and Illness worry and between Emotional instability and
PLCP. These results are in accordance with the general
findings of individuals who score high on emotional insta-
bility to have more worries and to report more bodily symp-
toms (Costa and McCrae, 1987; Rosmalen et al., 2007;
Watson and Pennebaker, 1989) as well as to report more
chest pain than others (Costa et al., 1982). Moreover, a pre-
vious study among cardiac patients suggested that those
with high scores for emotional instability reported lower
health-related quality of life (Van den Berg et al., 2005). In
this study, Emotional instability was found to be indirectly
related to PLCP via Illness worry. This finding is likely to
indicate that individuals with a higher score on emotional
instability experience more limitations due to chest pain
because they restrict their activity and are prone to believe
that such activity may have serious negative effect on the
health, despite the fact that such activity most likely will
improve their health condition.
Emotional instability can influence coping styles, which
in turn influence outcomes (Carver and Connor-Smith,
2010). Previous research indicates that more emotionally
instable individuals tend to use more passive or disengage-
ment coping styles when dealing with stressful life-events
and that such disengagement coping predicts poorer out-
comes (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010; Lahey, 2009).
This has, however, not been investigated among people
with NCCP. The main purpose of this study was thus to
examine the mediating role of coping styles in the relation-
ship between emotional instability and health outcomes
expressed by illness worry and PLCP among NCCP
patients. Results from the path analysis indicate that disen-
gaged or avoidant coping mediate the relationship of
Emotional instability with both Illness worry and PLCP.
These findings may suggest that more emotionally instable
NCCP patients are prone to avoid activities they fear can
elicit chest pain. Moreover, this type of avoidant behavior
may reduce opportunities to learn that activities could be
performed without chest pain, and is likely to maintain an
irrational belief that these activities could lead to a serious
health condition. This type of belief and coping could seri-
ously reduce the quality of life among more emotionally
instable persons experiencing chest pain. The results showed
a moderate negative association between Emotional insta-
bility and Acceptance, which is in accordance with a
Table 2. Pearson correlations between the measures Age, Gender, Emotional instability, Acceptance, Seeking Emotional Support,
Seeking Instrumental Support, Avoidance, Illness worry, and Perceived limitations due to chest pain (PLCP) (N=94).

previous report (Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007), and
that Acceptance coping style mediated the association of
Emotional instability with Illness worry, which in turn was
related to PLCP. Accepting their condition is difficult for
NCCP patients, and this leads to continued worry. Findings
indicate that this is especially so for more emotionally insta-
ble patients. Results from this study suggest that it is impor-
tant to identify more emotionally instable patients, and give
priority to helping them accept their condition and encour-
age them to maintain or resume their normal activities.
Coping by support seeking could provide patients with
information that could reduce worry, but it could also con-
tribute to maintaining worry because of the persistent focus
on the possible health threats the chest pain may signal. In
this study among NCCP patients, there was a slight ten-
dency for more emotionally instable patients to seek more
support. However, the seeking of support was unrelated to
chest pain­related worry and limitation. These findings are
interesting because this factor concerns a core challenge
among NCCP patients. Many people with NCCP continue
to seek medical help for their perceived condition without
being reassured that they do not have a serious somatic con-
dition. Findings suggest that the type of support seeking that
NCCP patients perform is not likely to be beneficial to them.
The correlational analyses also indicate that men tend to
use more avoidant coping and to be more worried by their
chest pain. Generally, men have a tendency to use more
avoidant coping styles, which in turn may be more adaptive
in handling everyday stress (Krohne, 1996). An explana-
tion for this phenomenon could be that chest pain due to
heart disease, such as myocardial infarction, is still viewed
as a male condition, and women might interpret their chest
pain as a less severe symptom (Granot et al., 2004).
Several limitations must be acknowledged. First, this
study is cross-sectional, which means that caution is neces-
sary if causality is inferred. Second, data are based on self-
report, and reporting bias may have influenced results.
Third, approximately 50percent of the eligible patients did
not participate in this study. Low participation rate is com-
mon in research among this patient group (40%­60%)
(Hicks et al., 2014; Kisely et al., 2012) and may represent a
validity problem. Yet, as relationships are assumed to be
linear, we do not have reason to believe that a low partici-
pation rate has affected results in a significant way.
However, more research is needed in order to make firm
conclusions.
Conclusion
The findings support the opinion that higher score on emo-
tional instability is associated with NCCP patients' illness
worry and their PLCP. Moreover, findings show that these
associations are mediated by the coping styles acceptance
and avoidance. Findings suggest that more emotionally
instable patients need to be identified and given special
attention. They should be carefully informed about possible
causes of their chest pain and how they best can adapt to
their condition. Reliable information may help them better
understand and accept their situation and contribute to
decreased illness worry as well as less PLCP. Moreover,
these patients are likely to benefit from opportunities to
expose themselves to situations and activities they usually
avoid, preferably in a safe and supervised environment.
Such experience may help them to learn that normal daily
activity and even strenuous physical activity is no danger to
but rather promotes their health.
Based on the findings in this study, future considerations
for interventions among NCCP patients should also involve
stress management techniques. Mindful techniques or cog-
nitive behavioral interventions to reduce worry and accept
the chest symptom as unharmful could be helpful (Querstret
and Cropley, 2013).
