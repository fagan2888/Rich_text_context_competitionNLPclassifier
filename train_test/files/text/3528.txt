At federal, state, and local levels, there has been a massive
push to increase the quality of early childhood education. For
example, the Race to the Top Early Learning Challenge and
the new Head Start performance standards have increased the
pressure for states and programs to use appropriate assess-
ments of classroom quality (National Research Council of the
National Academies, 2008). This is a well-founded focus
given that an abundance of literature has established a link
between classroom quality and children's outcomes (e.g.,
Burchinal, Vandergrift, Pianta, & Mashburn, 2009; Curby et
al., 2009; Mashburn et al., 2008; National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development [NICHD] Early Child Care
Research Network, 2003; Peisner-Feinberg et al., 2001).
The growing attention to the importance of quality has
resulted in many states adopting quality rating improvement
systems (QRISs) intended to hold centers accountable to
standard definitions of quality. Levels of quality are typically
conveyed to perspective parents and policy makers at the
center level through indicators such as stars or medals (Tout
et al., 2010), which summarize a variety of ratings into a
single, easily interpreted rating. In many states, including
Virginia and Minnesota (Tout et al., 2010), these ratings
incorporate measures of classroom quality for some or all
classrooms in a center (Zellman & Perlman, 2008). Due to
cost considerations, classroom observations are often com-
pleted in only a subset of classrooms in a center. Particularly,
when a small proportion of classrooms are observed in a
center, this approach necessarily assumes that the selected
classrooms are a good representation of the center (Karoly,
Zellman, & Perlman, 2013). The purpose of this study is to
quantify the degree to which one aspect of classroom quality,
emotional support, is a center-level phenomenon and to
begin to unravel the influence of center and center director
characteristics on classroom quality.
Classroom Quality and Children's
Outcomes
Children's experiences in early childhood classrooms can
establish a cycle of future social success or failure (Campbell
& von Stauffenberg, 2008). In classrooms, the quality of
teachers' interactions with children is one of the most salient
features children experience (Pianta, 1999). These interac-
tions are often divided into three domains: emotional sup-
port, classroom organization, and instructional support. In
particular, emotionally supportive interactions between chil-
dren and the adults who care for them positively influence

Understanding Preschool Teachers'
Emotional Support as a Function of
Center Climate
Katherine M. Zinsser1 and Timothy W. Curby2
Abstract
There is great emphasis recently on improving the quality of early childhood education in the United States. Within quality
rating improvement systems, classroom quality is often reported at the center or program levels. Yet little is known about
teaching quality at the center level or the influence of center characteristics on teaching quality. Specifically, this study
examines the extent to which the quality of emotional support provided by the teacher is associated with characteristics of
the center (e.g., prior turnover rates) and center director (e.g., education, management practices). Findings from Head Start
Family and Child Experiences Survey (FACES) 2009 data indicated that emotional support dimensions were differentially
predicted by characteristics of the center and the director, including prior teacher turnover rate and director job satisfaction.
However, highly regulated indicators of center quality (e.g., student:teacher ratio) did not substantially explain emotional
support.

children's development academically and socially (Howes et
al., 2008; Mashburn et al., 2008; Rimm-Kaufman & Pianta,
2000; Stipek & Byler, 2004). Emotionally supportive teach-
ers tend to be more aware of students' needs for extra aca-
demic or social support and tend to respond appropriately to
these needs (Hamre & Pianta, 2007). Consequently, children
in classrooms with more supportive teachers display more
adaptive learning behaviors and better academic outcomes
(Graziano, Reavis, Keane, & Calkins, 2007; Hamre & Pianta,
2005; Rimm-Kaufman, Curby, Grimm, Nathanson, & Brock,
2009), and lower rates of problem behaviors, negative affect,
and aggression (Howes et al., 2008; NICHD Early Child
Care Research Network, 2003; Zinsser, Bailey,
Curby, Denham & Bassett, 2013).
Center-Level Influences on Classroom
Quality
Beyond the individual classroom, a smaller body of research
(Bloom, 2010; Zinsser, 2013) has considered influences at
the center level, which may contribute to quality teaching
and children's achievement. Early childhood centers are
more than a series of contiguous classrooms, operating inde-
pendently with no effect on each other. Although center cli-
mate may be a more distal influence than the classroom
(Bronfenbrenner & Morris, 2006), center-level policies and
the center director affect classroom practice, which in turn
can affect child outcomes. In other words, children attending
early childhood programs are influenced not just by their
teachers and close peers but also by the less immediate and
indirect features of the early childhood environment, includ-
ing structural (teacher­child ratios), procedural (hiring deci-
sions), and interpersonal features (employee job satisfaction)
of the center in which the child's classroom operates.
Salary, Education, Student­Teacher Ratio
Some of the most tangible aspects of early childhood center
management have to do with how staff members are paid,
their levels of training, and the ratios of children to adults in
each classroom. There is a great deal of variance in the
annual salaries of administrators of early childhood educa-
tion centers, with top earners receiving nearly US$60,000
more per year than the bottom 10% of center directors (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2014). Furthermore, director edu-
cation has been found to be a predictor of overall program
quality (McCormick Center for Early Childhood Leadership,
2012), although the directionality of the association cannot
be assumed. Bloom describes center directors as "gate-keep-
ers to quality" (Bloom, 1999, p. 207). Through providing
graduate-level training for center administrators, Bloom and
others have shown that more highly educated directors are
better able to support high-quality teaching (Bloom &
Sheerer, 1992). In Bloom and Sheerer's (1992) study, direc-
tors who completed the advanced certificate program
reported greater perceived competence and decision-making
influence, and higher commitment to their centers than direc-
tors in a control group. Bloom and Sheerer also observed
significant differences in teacher quality, as measured by the
Early Childhood Classroom Observation Scale, across the
training and control groups, indicating that directors' educa-
tion may have pronounced impacts on the quality of teach-
ers' interactions with children.
Ratios have long been considered a critical component of
program quality (Howes, 1982), whereby smaller
teacher:child ratios are considered indicators of higher qual-
ity. As such, child care centers are required to operate within
acceptable ratio ranges as determined by state accrediting
bodies and Head Start performance standards. Therefore
ratios may not statistically relate to measures of quality
because of these restricted ranges. Mashburn et al. (2008)
found that there was a small positive correlation between
ratio and classroom emotional support at the classroom level.
Supportive Management
There is a positive relationship between the quality of center
management practices and the quality of children's learning
environments (Lower & Cassidy, 2007). Directors who are
able to foster a sense of community for teachers may facili-
tate positive attitudes toward teaching and help them be more
committed to and satisfied with their jobs, all critical compo-
nents of a high-quality education (McGinty, Justice, &
Rimm-Kaufman, 2008).
Unsatisfied teachers are more likely to contemplate leav-
ing their position while more satisfied teachers feel more
committed to the field of early childhood education (Saari &
Judge, 2004). Turnover rates for preschool teachers have been
previously documented at 25% to 50% annually; compara-
tively, public elementary school teacher turnover is about 7%
annually (Barnett et al., 2010). The instability of the preschool
teacher workforce has been attributed to a variety of condi-
tions associated with early childhood education, such as iso-
lationism, perceived lack of career reward, and lack of
preparation (McGinty et al., 2008). Stress and low overall job
satisfaction especially contribute to teacher turnover
(Rosenholtz & Simpson, 1990; Sutton & Wheatley, 2003) and
degrade teachers' abilities to be emotionally supportive
(Jennings & Greenberg, 2009). Teachers who experience
higher levels of stress at work are less consistent in their emo-
tional support and also tend to have students who display
greater negativity and aggression (Zinsser et al., 2013).
Turnover can have a large effect on a center. High turnover
rates year over year are likely to be an indicator of poor qual-
ity for a center. However, center directors may also counsel
underperforming teachers out, giving the director an opportu-
nity to affect program quality by hiring new teachers (Zinsser,
2013). Recently, turnover rates were additionally affected by
changes in Head Start policies. The Improving Head Start for
School Readiness Act of 2007 stipulated timelines for new
Zinsser and Curby 3
minimum education requirements for classroom teachers--
by 2011 all classroom teachers needed a minimum of an asso-
ciate's degree and by 2013 half of all classroom teachers
within a center were required to hold a bachelor's degree or
higher. Thus, centers employing a larger number of underedu-
cated teachers likely have turned over a number of positions,
hiring replacement teachers who meet the new requirements
and may provide higher quality instruction.
Director Job Satisfaction and Management
Challenges
Although there is a large quantity of research on the impact
of management styles on teachers' job satisfaction, to our
knowledge school administrators' own job satisfaction has
not received the same attention. Our ecological view of early
childhood centers, where the quality of teachers' interactions
with children may in part be influenced by adult interper-
sonal relationships in the center and broader organizational
factors, necessitates that we consider the director's commit-
ment to and satisfaction with his or her job as well. A frus-
trated or burned-out administrator may be less enthusiastic
or engaged in the running of a center, may provide less sub-
stantive feedback and professional development for teachers,
and may be less persistent in ensuring that a program has
sufficient resources to promote children's success and
teacher well-being.
To some degree, directors' satisfaction with their jobs
may be related to the challenges they face, how they priori-
tize responsibilities, and the decisions they make about how
to handle those challenges. Despite all working under the
same performance standards, even administrators in Head
Start show remarkably little agreement about the relative
importance of their various job responsibilities, such as
maintaining financial records and providing a positive envi-
ronment for teachers and students (Zinsser, Curby, & Ullrich,
in press). Directors' decision-making styles are related to the
quality of adult interpersonal relationships within the cen-
ter--team decision making increases staff motivation, dedi-
cation, and trust (Neugebauer, 1990).
Furthermore, administrators hold different opinions on the
relative importance of various instructional techniques, cur-
ricula, and professional development (Zinsser et al., in press),
which may influence teachers' classroom practices and
teacher­child relationships. This ecological view of early
childhood centers, where the quality of teachers' interactions
with children may in part be influenced by organizational fac-
tors, necessitates program evaluation approaches that respect
the shared experience of teachers within centers.
The Present Study
Bronfenbrenner's bioecological systems model
(Bronfebrenner & Morris, 2009) provides a natural platform
for the present investigation given that it nests the individual
child within concentric circles of proximal and distal influ-
ences. Attention to center-level influences on teacher quality
is particularly important when implementing accountability
efforts such as QRISs, which often sample teachers for
observation as an indicator of center quality. Although there
has been a great deal of research on classroom quality, analy-
ses typically only nest children within teachers, but not
teachers in centers. Recent evidence suggests that variations
in early childhood classroom quality ratings are attributable,
to some extent, to the center in which a classroom is housed
(Karoly et al., 2013), but the degree to which characteristics
of the center or center director (e.g., salary, management
style, commitment to the field, prioritization of social and
emotional learning) may account for some of the center-level
variance is largely unknown. Thus, a basic, yet important
line of inquiry focuses on the amount of variance in class-
room observations that is attributable to the center. If the
center-level variance is low, then a large proportion of teach-
ers should be observed to produce a reliable and accurate
estimate of a center's classroom quality.
The present study seeks to answer the following research
questions: (a) To what extent are ratings of classroom
Emotional Support dimensions attributable to the centers?
(b) Which characteristics of a center or its director best pre-
dict aspects of teachers' emotional supportiveness? To
address these goals, the present study used a large-scale,
nationally representative data set to estimate the amount of
center-level variance in emotional support. Subsequently,
center-level predictors were added to assess the degree to
which classroom emotional support could be associated with
center-level phenomena.
Method
Participants
Data come from the Head Start Family and Child Experiences
Survey (FACES) 2009 cohort (United States Department of
Health and Human Services, Administration for Children
and Families, Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation,
2013), a nationally representative sample of Head Start pro-
grams, centers, classrooms, children, and their families. In
the FACES study, multistage clustered sampling was used to
select programs, centers, and classrooms with probability
proportional to size. The full sample included 60 programs, 2
centers per program, and up to 3 classrooms per center for a
total of 486 classrooms. The analysis sample for the present
study includes 120 centers and 370 preschool classrooms as
these were the center-based classrooms (non-home visiting)
for which classroom observation data were available.
Additional demographic information for teachers can be
found in Table 1. The FACES 2009 cohort included 3,349
three-and four-year-old children (49.8% female) who were
22.9% White, Non-Hispanic; 33.0%AfricanAmerican, Non-
Hispanic; and 36.0% Hispanic/Latino.

Measures
In-person interviews were conducted with center directors dur-
ing the fall of 2009. During these interviews, directors reported
on program characteristics and management practices, as well
as personal workplace experiences, commitment, satisfaction,
and experience. Observations of classroom quality were con-
ducted by trained research assistants in the spring of 2010.
Classroom-level variables
Dimensions of emotional support.Observations of Emo-
tional Support dimensions were coded using the Classroom
Assessment Scoring System (CLASS Pre-K; Pianta, La Paro,
& Hamre, 2008) over four contiguous observation cycles
within a day. Each observation cycle consisted of a 20-min
observation followed by a 10-min rating period. During each
rating cycle, 10 dimensions of quality in teachers' interac-
tions with children were coded. Each dimension was scored
on a Likert-type scale from 1 = low to 7 = high. Based on
theoretical (Hamre & Pianta, 2007) and empirical (Mashburn
et al., 2008) work, three domains are typically formed from
10 dimensions: Emotional Support, Classroom Organization,
and Instructional Support. The present study focuses only on
the dimensions that constitute classroom Emotional Support:
Positive Climate, Negative Climate (reversed when aggregat-
ing), Teacher Sensitivity, and Regard for Student Perspec-
tives. Positive Climate describes the extent to which teachers
create an emotional atmosphere conducive to learning. Teach-
ers whose interactions foster relational closeness, enthusiasm,
and respect rate highly on Positive Climate. Negative Climate
refers to teachers' expressed irritability, anger, or aggression.
Teacher Sensitivity captures teachers'interactions that support
individual student needs, academic or emotional. Regard for
Student Perspectives describes the degree to which the teach-
ers' interactions with students and classroom activities place
an emphasis on students' interests, motivations, and points
of view, rather than being teacher-driven (Hamre & Pianta,
2007). Prior to data collection, raters completed training and
passed a reliability test, which consisted of being within 1
point of the gold standard rating 80% of the time (Moiduddin,
Aikens, Tarullo, West, & Xue, 2012).
Student:Teacher ratio. During each CLASS cycle, observ-
ers recorded the total number of children in the room and the
total number of adults. From this, a ratio of children to adults
was averaged across the observations.
Center-level variables
Job satisfaction. Directors reported on their Job Satisfac-
tion via 5-point anchors ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree) on three items, such as "I really enjoy
my present job" ( = .81).
Management challenges.Directors reported their experi-
ences with 11 possible challenges (e.g., staff turnover or not
enough funds for supplies and activities) on a 3-point scale
reflecting the degree to which such issues made their jobs
harder (0 = not at all harder, 1 = somewhat harder, or 2 = a
great deal harder;  = .78).
Prior turnover rate.The rate of prior turnover was com-
puted by dividing the total number of teachers who left the
center in the prior year and needed to be replaced by the total
number of teachers employed by the center.
Steps to address turnover. FACES directors were asked to
report which of seven strategies they were using to address
turnover of staff (e.g., increasing teacher salaries, providing
more or better training or education subsidies). Responses
across all seven items were summed and final scores range
from 0 (no steps to address turnover) to 7 (all strategies are
being utilized).
Supportive management practices.Directors reported on
efforts to support center staff using a 5-point Likert-type
scale (four items, such as my program "helps teachers feel
that they are part of a team,"  = .92). During the interview,
directors also reported their highest level of education and
their annual salary in whole numbers
Data Analysis
Analyses were conducted in a Hierarchical Linear Modeling
(HLM; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) framework to account
Zinsser and Curby 5
for the fact that the multiple teachers were nested within each
center. The first step in our analysis was to run an uncondi-
tional model for each outcome (Positive Climate, Negative
Climate, Teacher Sensitivity, and Regard for Student
Perspectives). This answered our first research question by
providing an estimate for each variable of the amount of
variance at the center level, quantified as an intraclass cor-
relation coefficient (ICC).
Next, the student­teacher ratio variable was added as a
predictor at Level 1. Finally, Level 2 variables were added to
the model. All variables were grand-mean centered during
analysis. HLM software does not report standardized coeffi-
cients, so all effects are reported with unstandardized coef-
ficients. Notably, classroom sampling weights were used to
adjust for the probability of classroom selection and class-
room-level response, such that results are representative of
the entire Head Start 2009 cohort of teachers and centers
(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Administration for Children and Families, Office of Planning,
Research and Evaluation, 2013).
Results
The degree to which there was center-level variance in each
of the emotional support dimensions was calculated by run-
ning unconditional models, which partition the variance in
each outcome into classroom-level and center-level compo-
nents. Each ICC is calculated as the proportion of center-
level variance divided by the total variance. ICCs from the
unconditional models are presented in Table 2. ICCs were
significant for Positive Climate (ICC = .18), Teacher
Sensitivity (ICC = .23), and Regard for Student Perspectives
(ICC = .34), but not for Negative Climate (ICC = .05).
Because the goal of the analyses was to look at the contribu-
tion of center-level predictors, and Negative Climate did not
have significant center-level variance, Negative Climate was
dropped from additional analyses. For the remaining dimen-
sions, the significant ICCs indicate that a portion of the vari-
ance in classroom quality can be attributed to the centers.
Final models with all predictors are presented in Table 2.
Each model provided an intercept that can be interpreted as
the mean level for the outcome when all classroom and cen-
ter variables had the average level (because they were cen-
tered at the grand mean). Positive Climate had an intercept of
5.38. In terms of predictors, surprisingly, Prior Turnover
Rate (b = 0.24, p < .05), the only significant predictor, was
positively related to Positive Climate. In other words, centers
with higher turnover the previous year had higher levels of
Positive Climate. For Teacher Sensitivity, the intercept was
4.74. Once again, Prior Turnover Rate was positively related
to the outcome (b = 0.32, p < .01). For Regard for Student
Perspectives, the intercept was 4.52. Job satisfaction was the
only significant predictor (b = 0.15, p < .05).
Discussion
Three findings are notable from this study. First, portions of
variance in some dimensions of emotional support can be
considered to be center-level characteristics. Second, emo-
tional support dimensions were differentially predicted by
characteristics of the center and the director. Third, typical
indicators of center quality do not substantially explain class-
room quality in the form of emotional support.
Center-Level Variance
There was a wide range of variance attributable to the center
level. Estimates ranged from an insignificant amount of vari-
ance in Negative Climate to 34% in Regard for Student
Perspective. Thus, in some instances and to some extent,
dimensions of emotional support can be viewed as a charac-
teristic of the center. These dimensions are typically aggre-
gated together; however, the amount that they have variance
attributable to the center varied substantially across
dimensions.
Negative Climate
Negative Climate, while an indicator of classroom quality
and a predictor of child outcomes (Curby & Chavez, 2013),
must be considered in a different way from the other three
dimensions of emotional support. The fact that Negative
Climate does not have (much) center-level variance suggests
that this is primarily a characteristic of a classroom and
not a center. However, this should not be taken to mean that
center-level supports would not be useful. Rather,

center-level support should be given individually to those
teachers who struggle with Negative Climate in their class-
rooms. In instances of classrooms with persistent Negative
Climate, interventions would likely be most effective if they
focused on working with centers to support individual
teachers on classroom climate, rather than applying more
universal center-level interventions.
Generally, these results do not support the use of the
CLASS instrument as an indicator of center quality, such as
in QRIS programs, in instances when few teachers from a
center are sampled as only a small proportion of teachers'
classroom practices are indicators of center quality. These
results are in alignment with those of Karoly and colleagues
(2013) who suggested that center-level evaluations of class-
room quality will be best estimated using a larger proportion
of randomly selected classrooms. This finding is especially
important to communicate to center directors and state QRIS
administrators. When a large proportion of classrooms are
not sampled, few inferences can be made about the center,
just as teachers should not be judged based on a handful of
observations or children.
Predictors of Emotional Support
Turnover.Turnover rate, generally considered a negative
indicator of center quality, was actually found to be a posi-
tive indicator of emotional support. We had expected to find
a negative effect because turnover is likely to bring in less-
experienced teachers who require additional training, and
teachers who are leaving on their own will may be choosing
to do so because of negative characteristics of the center.
However, as was alluded to above, it is possible that turn-
over may also reflect purposeful counseling-out of under-
performing or underqualified teachers on the part of a center
director. Although these data do not allow us to explain the
cause of high turnover rates, it is notable that these data
were collected shortly after the most recent Head Start
Reauthorization Act (2007), which raised teacher education
requirements. Therefore, in this 2009 sample, turnover may
have been increased relative to past cohorts as the 2011
deadline for new education minimums approached. Unfor-
tunately, this explanation cannot be tested with prior years'
FACES data, because 2009 was the first year in which the
entire CLASS measure was administered. One potential
explanation for this positive association between quality and
prior turnover rates is that newly hired teachers may be bet-
ter educated than those they are replacing. It may also be
that teachers who were hired more recently have been
trained in ways that reflect more recent conceptualizations
of classroom quality and are thus better able to teach in
more emotionally supportive ways. Head Start Directors
may also be hiring teachers differentially. Directors may be
hiring teachers who are more knowledgeable about the
CLASS measure because it is commonly being used to eval-
uate program quality. Furthermore, recent qualitative work
has shown that teachers who score higher on CLASS Emo-
tional Support actually conceptualize their role in emotion
education differently from lower scoring peers (Zinsser,
Shewark, Denham, & Curby, 2014). Either way, directors
may be aware of these differences when interviewing pro-
spective new hires or using such differences to make hiring
decisions.
Director job satisfaction.The other significant predictor of
center variance in emotional support was center director job
satisfaction. Directors who enjoy their jobs, feel they are
making a difference, and are committed to early childhood
education tended to have teachers who scored higher on
Regard for Student Perspectives. Regard for Student Per-
spectives includes the degree to which teachers are over-
controlling (low end) or give students autonomy and respon-
sibility (high end). It may be that teachers who give students
autonomy are easier to work with and are contributing to a
more positive workplace environment. Perhaps this is easier
to see in the opposite: Teachers who are over-controlling
may be very particular in how they feel their classroom
should operate and may be less accepting of director input.
Thus, a center director's feelings of efficacy could be dimin-
ished, resulting in lower job satisfaction. We believe that this
association is important to communicate to center directors
as well, as it underscores the interconnected ecology of pre-
school centers. Directors' own workplace experiences are
indirectly related to children's experiences in the classrooms
through their teachers. Thus, directors who wish to positively
affect children may benefit from some degree of
self-reflection.
Seeking additional predictors of center-level variance.Except
for the predictors discussed above, the majority of hypoth-
esized predictors of center-level variance were not predic-
tive. Many structural characteristics of centers that are
heavily regulated and for which there are resources avail-
able to directors (e.g., education level, management chal-
lenges such as insufficient technical assistance, and
supportive management practices such as providing orien-
tation to new teachers) were not related to emotional sup-
port dimensions. For example, student:teacher ratio, which
conceptually should be related to emotional support, was
not related in these data. However, unsurprisingly, the regu-
lations around ratios result in little variance, and therefore
any effects of these ratios has already been felt throughout
the programs. We suspect a similar reason was at play with
center director education levels, where all directors had at
least some college and the majority had a bachelor's degree
or greater. Thus, any effects of education would have to be
operating within the higher end of education. Conversely,
there was a great deal of variance in center director salaries
but salary was not a significant predictor in any of our mod-
els. We expect that this lack of association is due in part to
the fact that Head Start grantees determine pay scales based
Zinsser and Curby 7
on local factors such as cost of living. Although within a
grantee's jurisdiction more effective center directors may
be paid more, when examining data nationally, we cannot
assume that all highly paid directors in urban areas with
high costs of living are more effective managers than their
rural peers
Another reason for the lack of associations may be that
the characteristics captured in these scales of challenges and
supportive techniques are not telling the whole story. There
have been calls for research to identify what effective center
director management practices look like in the early child-
hood field (Muijs, Aubrey, Harris, & Briggs, 2004). Still,
the majority of research on early childhood leadership has
focused on more tangible aspects of program administra-
tion, including compliance with health, safety, legislative,
and contractual requirements; coordinating family and
social services; and financial management (e.g., Osgood &
Stone, 2002). Even the recently formed Head Start National
Center on Program Management and Fiscal Operations is
primarily focused on structural components such as "fiscal
planning . . . risk management, governance, data collection
and analysis, and budgeting and cost allocation" (Education
Development Center, 2014). Future research utilizing less
structurally focused measures will be necessary to identified
which characteristics of centers and/or center directors
account for shared variance in classroom emotional support
quality.
Although broader, the well-known work conducted by
Bloom and colleagues (Bloom, 2010; Bloom & Sheerer,
1992; Talan & Bloom, 2011) also takes a structural
approach. In response to decades of research into early
childhood teacher turnover, job satisfaction, and burnout,
Bloom worked to develop assessment tools focused on
organizational climate and work attitudes (Bloom, 2010)
to help program administrators identify organizational
threats to teacher retention and quality of care. The Early
Childhood Job Satisfaction Survey captures teachers'
experiences of workplace satisfaction and frustration as
well as experiences of support and professional growth
(Bloom, 2010). Although it is more emotionally focused,
this instrument has not been extensively used to examine
directors' experiences or the associations among direc-
tors, teachers and emotionally supportive classroom
practices.
In predicting children's emotional experiences in pre-
school, measures that tap into emotional climate and emo-
tionally relevant management practices may be most
beneficial for identifying the role of emotions in early child-
hood education and connecting workplace climate with
teacher and child social and emotional competencies
(Zinsser, 2013). When present, a culture and climate of sup-
port within a Head Start center can have positive impacts on
teachers' job satisfaction and commitment (McGinty et al.,
2008) and the quality of children's learning environments
(Lower & Cassidy, 2007).
Limitations and Future Directions
It is notable that a majority of the predictors included in these
models were not able to significantly explain the center-level
variance in Emotional Support. This could be due to limita-
tions in measurement. The variables selected and included in
these models are somewhat indirectly related to the mea-
sured outcomes. It is possible that there are other center-level
indicators of center directors contributing to emotional sup-
port, such as the employment of a mental health consultant or
adoption of a social-emotional learning curriculum, which
could be included in future analyses. Future work should
also consider role of assistant directors in a center.
Beyond such structural components, there are few mea-
sures that capture non-structural center director elements
which may influence classroom emotional support quality.
Measures that assess the process of a director constructing an
emotionally supportive climate and culture may better eluci-
date the connections between teachers' workplace experi-
ences and their use of supportive classroom practices. Future
work to develop such measures would benefit both research
and practice if paired with professional development.
Although generalizable to Head Start in 2009, we do not
know the degree to which features of Head Start make this
study's findings unique to that context, nor do we know how
changing policies have continued to reshape Head Starts and
thereby change this study's findings. Future work will need
to continue to explore the stability of these findings over
time and in different early childhood contexts.
Conclusion
Initiatives such as the Race To The Top Early Learning
Challenge encourage the development of a high-quality early
childhood workforce. Thus research into the potential path-
ways of influence on teachers and students is increasingly
necessary. In particular, it is important to know how center-
level contextual factors lay the foundation for supportive
teacher­child interactions. Findings indicate that center-level
characteristics explain meaningful portions of variance in
each dimension of emotional support except Negative
Climate but that these dimensions were differentially pre-
dicted by characteristics of the center and the director,
including director job satisfaction. Based on these results we
now know that a substantial proportion of teachers' class-
room behaviors can be explained by factors at the center
level. At the same time, this study draws into question the
trend of QRIS programs utilizing aggregate observations of a
small sample of teachers to represent center quality, because
only a third of teachers' classroom practices are representa-
tive of center-level quality.
