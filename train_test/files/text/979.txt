Abstract
Objective: To fully explore the long-term shifts in the nutrition transition and the full
implications of these changes in the Chinese diet.
Design: A descriptive, population-based study.
Setting: Data come from nationally representative surveys: the China Health and
Nutrition Survey (1989­1997), the China National Nutrition Survey (1982 and 1992),
the annual household consumption surveys of the State Statistical Bureau, and the
Annual Death Report of China.
Results: During the first part of the major economic transformation in China (before
1985), cereal intake increased but decreased thereafter. There was also a long-term
reduction of vegetable consumption that has now stabilised. Intake of animal foods
increased slowly before 1979 and more quickly after the economic reforms occurred.
While the total energy intake of residents has decreased, as has energy expenditure,
large changes in the composition of energy have occurred. The overall proportion of
energy from fat increased quickly, reaching an overall average of 27.3% and 32.8% for
urban residents in 1997. Over a third of all Chinese adults and 60.1% of those in urban
areas consumed over 30% of their energy from fat in 1997. Large shifts towards
increased inactivity at work and leisure occurred. These changes are linked with rapid
increases of overweight, obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (DR-
NCDs) as well as total mortality for urban residents.
Conclusions: The long-term trend is a shift towards a high-fat, high-energy-density
and low-fibre diet. The Chinese have entered a new stage of the nutrition transition.

China
China represents one of the more rapidly developing
countries in the world. In the past two decades, the annual
growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) was
more than 8%, the highest rate in recent world history1.
China has achieved remarkable economic progress and
high levels of education, but a rapid evolution of the
Chinese diet has accompanied these economic shifts and
related social changes. A longer, more detailed history of
the Chinese nutrition transition is available2.
The classic Chinese diet includes cereals and vegetables
with few animal foods. It is a diet that many scholars
consider most healthful when adequate levels of intake
are achieved3. Earlier research by these authors has shown
rapid changes in the diets and body composition of
Chinese adults during the 1980­91 period4,5. As the classic
eating pattern shifts, intakes of cereals and many lower-fat,
mixed dishes are being replaced, animal foods are
becoming popular, and the consumption of edible oils is
increasing quickly. This shift in the composition of diet
and corresponding body composition has been
accompanied by many positive and some negative
changes. Infectious diseases and hunger, important causes
of death in the 1950s, no longer affect most of the
population. Although malnutrition and nutrition
deficiency diseases are still problems that should not be
overlooked, the burden is shifting to diet-related, non-
communicable disease (DR-NCD) with a rapid increase in
the prevalence of obesity. Fertility and mortality,
particularly infant and child mortality, are declining;
respiratory diseases are rapidly receding in importance;
and life expectancy has reached high levels. Heart
diseases, cerebrovascular diseases and cancer are now
the major sources of mortality.
There are five periods of dietary pattern change in China
that fit together to mark shifts in the stages of the nutrition
transition in China6. This paper shows that China is
transforming very rapidly from the pattern of the earliest,
receding famine stage, to that of the present, DR-NCD
stage. The first period was between 1949 and 1957, when
food production was inadequate and low cereal con-
sumption patterns existed. The second period was a sharp
decrease in food consumption from 1957 to 1962 during
the famine linked with The Great Leap Forward7. The third
period, between 1962 and 1979, was one of a strong
recovery. The fourth, or reform period, from 1979 to 1985,
came after the liberalisation of food production, when the
annual economic growth rate was over 10%. After this
rapid growth, further economic improvement led to a shift
in energy requirements and the structure of the Chinese
diet shifted; this is the fifth period presented in Popkin

et al.4 (1993). This paper explores the long-term shifts in
the nutrition transition through these stages and the full
implications of these changes in the Chinese diet.
Subjects and methods
Dietary data
Data were obtained from three sources. First, data from the
1952 to 2000 annual household consumption surveys8
were used to analyse the long-term transitions in dietary
and nutrition in China. The design of the surveys
undertaken by the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) is similar
to a longitudinal survey, but about 20% of households in
the sampling communities would be changed each year8.
Second, two rounds of the China National Nutrition Survey
(CNNS) data (1982 and 1992) were used in this paper ­
each from large nation-wide surveys9. From the third
source, the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS),
rounds of the 1989­1997 data are used6,10. In both cases,
dietary data were collected by a combination of the
weighing method and three consecutive 24-hour recalls.
CNNS and CHNS data are used for the short-term analyses.
Physical activity data
The CHNS collected detailed data on occupation, work
character, labour force, work time and other items related
to physical activities. Physical activity was classified into
three categories: light, moderate and vigorous11. The
ownership of television (TV) sets was also analysed to
reflect the shift in physical activities.
Anthropometric data
Data from both CNNS and CHNS were used; both surveys
measured height and weight12,13. The World Health
Organization's (WHO) cut-off points for body mass
index (BMI) were used to define underweight ðBMI ,
18:5 kg m22Þ and overweight ðBMI $ 25 kg m22Þ: Over-
weight and obesity ðBMI $ 30 kg m22Þ categories are
combined for two reasons. The proportion of BMI $
30 kg m22 was very low (only 1.5% in 1992) and a recent
international group from the WHO-Pacific Region has
recommended that a lower BMI cut-off for overweight and
obesity of 23 and 25 kg m22, respectively, should be used
in Asia14.
Mortality and causes of death data
These data came from the Annual Death Report from the
Ministry of Health of China. Diseases are classified
according to WHO's International Classification of
Disease, Injuries, and Causes of Death, version 9 (ICD-9).
Results
Food consumption pattern
The shift in the Chinese diet follows a classic Westernisa-
tion pattern. The economic progress, linked in part to
liberalisation of food production controls and the
introduction of a free market for food and food products,
is linked to these important shifts in diet15. This study
focused on shifts in key, separate components of the
Chinese diet.
Cereals
Long-term. There are really five different periods of
change in the past. The first period was between 1949 and
1957 when food production was inadequate and low
cereal consumption patterns existed. There is a lack of
data on cereal consumption during the second period
from 1957 to 1962, but there was a sharp decrease in food
consumption during the famine linked with The Great
Leap Forward7. Per capita intake of cereals increased
steadily from 165 kg to 195 kg (1.8 kg annually) in the third
period (1962­1979), one of strong recovery. During the
fourth or reform period (1979­1985), after the liberal-
isation of food production when the annual economic
growth rate was over 10%, China began to import cereals.
As a result, per capita intake of cereals increased by 60 kg
within six years; 10 kg each year, or a 27.4 g increase each
day. Further economic improvement led to a shift in
energy requirements, the structure of the Chinese diet
shifted, and cereal consumption has declined slowly since
1985; this is the fifth period4.
Short-term. Both CNNS and CHNS data show that the
intake of cereals decreased considerably during the past
two decades in both urban and rural areas and among all
income groups. During the eight-year period from 1989 to
1997, the total mean intake of cereals decreased by
127 g person21 day21 (67 g person21 day21 for urban resi-
dents and 161 g person21 day21 for rural residents). The
decrease in the low-income group was the highest
(196 g person21 day21) compared with their counterparts
in middle- and high-income groups (86 and
85 g person21 day21, respectively).
The shift away from coarse grain consumption such as
millet, sorghum and corn is a key component of this
change. CHNS data show a decrease of 38 g person21 -
day21 in refined cereals between 1989 and 1997, but an
even larger decrease in coarse cereal consumption of
89 g person21 day21. CNNS data show the intake of refined
cereals in 1992 to be similar to that in 1982, but the intake
of coarse cereals decreased by 59 g person21 day21.
Vegetables and fruits
Long-term. Urban residents' intake, which was slightly
higher than rural residents', decreased steadily from 1983
to 1997 and stabilised thereafter. Among rural residents,
there was a sharp decrease from 1992 to 1993, a smaller
decline from 1993 to 1995, and then a slight increase.

Short-term. CHNS data show that the total intake of
vegetables decreased by 32 g person21 day21 between
1989 and 1997; the intake of vegetables of rural residents
decreased by 52 g person21 day21.
In contrast, the intake of fruits, which are much more
expensive than vegetables, showed an increase of
6.9 g person21 day21 from 1989 to 1997. Urban residents'
intake of fruits in 1997 was 2.5 times that of 1989. Rural
residents' intake of fruits increased by 1.8 g person21 -
day21 during the same period.
As a whole, total intakes of vegetables and fruits
decreased from 391.8 g person21 day21 in 1989 to
366.7 g person21 day21 in 1997. The largest decrease
occurred in the low-income group, from 441.5 to
364.0 g person21 day21, or 77.5 g person21 day21.
Animal foods
Long-term. Per capita annual consumption of animal
foods more than tripled from a very low consumption
level of 11 kg in 1952 to 38 kg in 1992. There was a slow
rate of increase prior to 1979 but thereafter it was much
higher. Intake increased by only 5.6 kg (0.2 kg annually)
from 1952 to 1979, while it increased by 21 kg (1.6 kg
annually) between 1979 and 1992. Urban residents' annual
intake increased to 65.3 kg person21 in 1999.
Short-term. Urban residents' daily intake of animal
foods per capita in 1997 was higher than for rural residents
(178.2 vs. 116.7 g person21 day21) and also showed a
larger increase (46.7 vs. 36.8 g person21 day21) from 1989
to 1997. The amount and growth of intake of animal foods
were positively associated with income levels. Intake in
the low-income group was 77.6 g person21 day21 in 1997,
an increase of 18.6 g; while it was 123.2 and
19.6 g person21 day21 in the middle-income group; and
191.7 and 64.8 g person21 day21 for the high-income
group. The intake level and the increase in the high-
income group were almost three times those in the low-
income group.
Composition of energy and micronutrients in the
diet
Long-term
Trends of energy intake were similar to those of cereals.
Total energy intake increased before 1985; then began to
decrease. Total energy intake was 2270 kcal (9.50 MJ) in
1952, 2440 kcal (10.21 MJ) in 1982 and 2328 kcal (9.74 MJ)
in 1992. Among the energy components, there was little
change in the proportion of energy from protein, but the
proportion of protein from animals increased consider-
ably. Only 3.1% of protein came from animal foods in
1952, which increased to 18.9% in 1992. The intake of fat
doubled (28.3 vs. 58.3 g). Sources of energy changed
remarkably: energy from fat increased twofold (11% vs.
22%), energy from carbohydrates decreased from 77% to
66%, and energy from animal foods increased from 4.9% to
9.3%.
Short-term
CHNS data show the shift away from carbohydrates to fat
in the diet. Energy from carbohydrates for all residents
(Table 1) decreased to 59.8% in 1997 from 68.7% in 1989
and to only 53.3% from 65.8% in 1989 among urban
residents, the lowest for any group. Energy from fat
increased sharply from 19.3% in 1989 to 27.3% in 1997.
The shift towards a high-fat diet is shown more pointedly
by examining those with low- and high-fat diets, and diets
higher in animal fat, from 1989 to 1997. The proportion of
adults with a high-fat diet increased by 2.5 times (14.7% vs.
38.5%) within these eight years. The proportion of adult
diets with a fat energy of less than 10% declined
considerably (18.4% to 3.1%) over this same eight-year
period. Over 60% of urban residents consumed more than
30% of energy from fat in 1997.
Physical activity
Energy expenditure at work and the proportion of TV set
ownership from 1989 to 1997 were used to measure
changes in daily physical activities. Large changes in
technology in the workplace and in leisure activities are
linked with rapid declines in physical activity. Economic
activities are shifting towards the service sector, particu-
larly in urban areas16. The proportion of urban adults
working in occupations where they participate in vigorous
activity patterns has decreased, and increased where the
activity pattern is light. In rural areas, however, there has
been a shift towards increased physical activity linked to
residents holding multiple jobs and more intensive effort.
For rural women, there is a shift towards a larger
proportion engaged in more energy-intensive work but
there are also proportions where light effort is increasing.
In contrast, the proportion of rural men engaged in light
work effort has decreased slightly.
TV set ownership increased considerably during this
eight-year period, especially in rural areas and among
lower-income groups. In 1997, close to 90% of Chinese

households owned a TV set. Clearly, TV ownership
represents a major, potential source of inactivity.
Body composition
There has been a profound increase in the body mass
index distribution of Chinese adults, particularly at BMI
levels from 23 to 30 kg m22. Overweight and obesity were
rare in 1982; only 3.5% of adults, aged 20­45 years, had a
BMI above 25 kg m22 and only 0.2% were classified as
obese. These rates increased fourfold to 14.1% and 1.3%,
respectively, in 1997. The prevalence was much higher in
urban areas compared with rural areas (20.9% vs. 14.2%),
and this was especially true in large cities. In 1992, more
than 40% of urban residents in Beijing were overweight
and obese, which would be a serious public health
problem9. In the past 15 years, there has been an increase
of almost one percentage point per year (0.93) in the
prevalence rate, equal to an additional 12 million
overweight and obese cases each year.
At the same time, there is still a meaningful proportion
of adults with low BMI who face chronic undernutrition
(Table 2). CHNS and CNNS data show that this proportion
decreased by 0.4 percentage points yearly during the
period 1982­1992, and by 0.2 percentage points yearly
between 1992 and 1997.
Morbidity
CHNS blood pressure data show a modest increase in
hypertension between 1991 and 1997 among adults aged
30­65 years. Hypertension is greater among males and
urban residents, which is not surprising given the greater
obesity found in urban areas. Interestingly, the prevalence
of hypertension in males in urban areas decreased slightly
(not statistically significant) from 1991 to 1997, while it
increased among all other groups, especially in rural males.
Mortality of degenerative chronic diseases
The overall death rate decreased between 1974 and 1984,
there was no major clear reduction from 1984 to 1990, and
a rise since then in urban areas. It increased by 34.7 per
100 000 during this latter period (Fig. 1)17. This shift is
noteworthy, as it seems to be concurrent with the increase
in DR-NCDs related to the circulatory system and cancer.
The 1999 specific mortality of infection and parasite
diseases in rural areas, for example, was one-seventh of
the 1974 rate (58.2 vs. 8.0 per 100 000), but the mortality of
diabetes in urban areas increased fivefold in 1999
compared with 1974 (15.4 vs. 3.4 per 100 000).
Discussion
In the half-century since Chinese independence, there
have been five major periods related to the stages of the
nutrition transition. The country was transformed from
one facing famine and extreme food shortages to one
where the food supply addressed basic needs; food intake
of key food types (cereals, vegetables, animal foods) as
well as total energy intake increased. Continuing the shift
towards a reduction of malnutrition between 1985 and
1990, total energy began to decrease, and food diversity
and animal food intake increased considerably. After 1990,
China entered a later stage of the transition as obesity
began to increase, energy density of the diet increased
considerably, and cereal intake decreased considerably.
DR-NCDs began to increase rapidly.
What is the basis for stating a new stage of the
nutrition transition was reached?
First, the overall 1999 death rate among urban residents
increased to a higher rate than in the early 1970s primarily
from DR-NCDs such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes
and cancers. Mortality rates of rural residents are still
improving (lowering), but we expect these rates will also
shift upwards in the next several decades. Farmers have
become richer in many regions of the country and the rural
diet is following the same shift towards animal products
that urban areas followed (i.e. reduced carbohydrate and
increased edible oil and total fat). Adult obesity in rural
areas is beginning to increase. Cancer and cardiovascular
disease will soon become the major causes of mortality in
rural China.
Second, China is facing simultaneous challenges of
malnutrition and overnutrition. In past decades, the
government tried its best to solve the malnutrition problem
and made great progress. However, the prevalence of
malnutrition is still very high: 35% of pre-school children
were stunted; 20% of pre-school children, 22% of school
children and adolescents, and 8% of adults were suffering
from undernutrition18. On the other hand, the prevalence
of overweight and obesity has risen to a relatively high
degree. Other studies have shown large increases in
overweight among pre-school children, older children and
teenagers19. For example, 15% (28% in urban areas) of
children aged 2­6 years and 8% (12% in urban areas, 11
times that of 15 years ago) of children and adolescents aged
7­17 years were overweight and obese, based on the

cut-off points of BMI for overweight and obesity from
the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF)18.
The research by Doak et al.20 highlights this shift in the
distribution of under- and overnutrition in a different way.
Their research identified households in which overweight
and underweight coexist,and explored causative household
levels. In China, the prevalence of such households was 8%.
Third, marked shifts in the Chinese diet have been
shown. Unlike other East Asian countries such as South
Korea (which has actively promoted its traditional diets),
China seems to be rapidly relinquishing its traditional diet.
The level of fat intake in South Korea is even lower than in
China, although China's gross national product (GNP) was
less than 1/14 of the GNP in South Korea in 1996. Starting
in the 1990s, people in China obtained more than 20% of
energy from fat while South Koreans consumed less than
20% of energy from fat in 199521. Edible oil intake
increases unabated in China, as does the intake of other
animal products22.
Also, there has recently been a rapid increase in food
consumption from away-from-home sources. Popkin
et al.10 have shown the energy consumed at restaurants
and stalls in China increased from 0.4% in 1989 to over
7.4% in 1997. Some scholars feel that increased away-
from-home food consumption is a contributing factor to
increased overweight and obesity23.
