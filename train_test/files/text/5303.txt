Introduction
Imagine that you are a woman who has just completed a job
interview. As you reflect on your performance, you hear
other candidates suggest that the interviewer seemed sexist.
You then find out you are rejected for the job. How does this
make you feel? Prior research has shown that a mere sugges-
tion of sexism can have a range of harmful effects for those
exposed to it (Adams, Garcia, Purdie-Vaughns, & Steele,
2006). This is because a suggestion of sexism introduces a
social identity threat, that is, a reminder of the often negative
and hostile views held about women in society (Steele,
Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). This reminder has damaging
effects for individual women and can induce a psychological
state that actually promotes stereotype confirmation, for
instance, through poor task performance. For example,
Adams and colleagues (2006) showed that when it was sug-
gested to female participants that sexist treatment may have
occurred in an instruction situation, they reported a more
negative experience and performed worse on a test than
female participants who were not exposed to a suggestion of
sexism (see also Schmitt, Branscombe, & Postmes, 2003,
Study 2, and Schmitt & Branscombe, 2002, for a review of
the negative psychological effects of discrimination).
However, other evidence indicates that a suggestion of
sexism might at times be beneficial. Suggesting that sexism
may have occurred can create a climate that condemns sexist
treatment, thereby reducing sexist beliefs (Blanchard,
Crandall, Brigham, & Vaughn, 1994), and it can communi-
cate social support that has an important role in promoting
collective protest for social change (Van Zomeren, Spears,
Fischer, & Leach, 2004). Importantly, a suggestion of sexism
can actually protect the self-confidence of individual women
by helping to discount personal responsibility for a negative
outcome (Major, Quinton, & Schmader, 2003; see Major,
Quinton, & McCoy, 2002, for a review). Indeed, in one study,
women who received negative feedback reported higher per-
sonal self-esteem when they heard a confederate suggest that
the evaluator was sexist than when they did not hear such a
suggestion (Major et al., 2003).
In sum, prior investigations of the effects of a suggestion
of sexism have revealed rather mixed findings. Both harmful
and self-protective effects of a suggestion of sexism have
been documented on similar outcome variables, which can
be seen as indicators of self-confidence and of stereotype
confirmation. Our goal is to provide further evidence bearing

Men as Allies Against Sexism: The
Positive Effects of a Suggestion of Sexism
by Male (vs. Female) Sources
Sezgin Cihangir1,2, Manuela Barreto1,3, and Naomi Ellemers1
Abstract
Sexism is often expressed in subtle and ambiguous ways, causing targets to doubt their own capabilities or to show stereotype-
confirming behavior. This research examines whether the self-confidence and stereotype (dis-)confirming behavior of targets
of sexism can be bolstered when other male versus female sources suggest that sexism may have played a role. Both Study
1 (N = 78) and Study 2 (N = 90) show that a suggestion of sexism has more beneficial effects when it is made by male
sources than when it is made by female sources. When males suggested that sexism had taken place, targets reported
more self-confidence (less self-handicapping and higher personal performance state self-esteem) and showed less stereotype
confirmation (less self-stereotyping and better task performance) than when sexism was suggested by a female source. Study
2 additionally revealed that targets are more likely to file a complaint when men suggest that sexism took place than when
this same suggestion was made by women. These results indicate that men can constitute important allies against sexism if
they speak out when sexist treatment takes place.

on this topic and to examine a potential moderator of this
effect. Specifically, we propose that a suggestion of sexism
might have rather different effects depending on who makes
it--whether the source of this suggestion is male or female.
Men as Allies Against Sexism
Although it is clear that men often voice discontent with the
sexist treatment of women (see Tougas & Beaton, 2002, for
a review), research on the consequences of this behavior is as
yet scarce. What is currently known pertains to how male
perpetrators react when men versus women confront them
about their sexist behavior (Czopp & Monteith, 2003). This
work showed that (male and female) sexist perpetrators were
more likely to feel guilty and found the confronter more rea-
sonable if they were confronted by men than if they were
confronted by women. However, the point of view of the tar-
get has not been examined in prior research. Thus, we do not
know how female targets react when men (vs. women) sug-
gestthattheymighthavebeentargetsofsexism.Nevertheless,
as long as it cannot be fully prevented or avoided that women
are exposed to sexist treatment, it is as important if not more
so to understand how they can be helped to best cope with
such experiences.
A suggestion of sexism can protect individual women
from the conclusion that they are incompetent, but it can also
make clear that one's social identity is not valued by others
(see, for example, Adams et al., 2006; Major et al., 2003).
Whether the negative or the positive potential will be real-
ized is likely to depend on a series of factors (Major et al.,
2002; Schmitt & Branscombe, 2002, for reviews of evidence
bearing on both points). In the current research, we focus on
the gender of those making the suggestion that sexism may
have played a role. We propose that when men suggest that
sexism has taken place, this is likely to have more beneficial
effects on the target, compared with when the same sugges-
tion is made by women.
To understand this prediction, it is important to consider
that a suggestion of sexism can be threatening. This is the
case first because reminding people that sexist views persist
reinforces the notion that an important part of one's identity
(i.e., her gender) is devalued by others. Second, noting the
existence of sexist treatment raises the expectation that one
will be exposed to biased treatment on future occasions as
well (Adams et al., 2006; see also Schmitt et al., 2003;
Stroebe, Dovidio, Barreto, Ellemers, & John, 2011). When
people perceive that they have subjected to prejudice by
members of a given outgroup, they expect a similar treat-
ment on future encounters with other members of that out-
group (Tropp, 2003). However, this is less likely to be the
case when members of that same outgroup expose and label
prior treatment as prejudicial. Indeed, males who point out
that women might have been targets of sexism on one hand
make salient that sexist treatment may re-occur, but on the
other hand also convey that not all men are sexist or hostile
toward women. As sexism is expected from males but less so
from females (Baron, Burgess, & Kao, 1991), female sources
who suggest that sexism has taken place only raise negative
expectations about biased treatment in the future, and do lit-
tle to alleviate the concern that other men might be sexist too.
Based on this reasoning, we propose that when a male source
suggests that sexism may have played a role, this is likely to
have self-protective effects, while this is less likely to be the
case when the same suggestion is voiced by a female source.
In sum, our main prediction is that when a suggestion of
sexism is made by a male (vs. female) source, this reduces
the social identity threat implied in acknowledging group-
based discrimination, and makes it easier for targets to
engage in self-protective responses. As such, a suggestion of
sexism made by a male source is likely to induce more self-
confidence after negative feedback than when this sugges-
tion stems from a female source. This is akin to what happens
when discrimination is presented as rare instead of as perva-
sive: While discrimination perceived as pervasive seems to
have mainly negative effects on well-being, targets can profit
from attributing a negative outcome to discrimination that is
seen as a rare occurrence, which helps them protect their
self-esteem (Schmitt et al., 2003; see also Cihangir,
Scheepers, Barreto, & Ellemers, 2013; Foster, 2009; Schmitt,
Branscombe, Kobrynowicz, & Owen, 2002; Stroebe et al.,
2011). The novelty of the approach we take in this article is
that we propose a similar effect without changing anything
about what is suggested (i.e., about the frequency of occur-
rence), but merely as a consequence of who indicates sexism
may have played a role.
Overview of the present research. In two studies, we examined
responses of individual women to a suggestion of sexism
depending on whether it was made by male or by female
sources. We tested our predictions in a job-interview para-
digm where women were exposed to subtle sexism in all
conditions (through gender-biased questions allegedly posed
by the interviewer) and subsequently to a suggestion that
sexism may (not) have played a role, which was made by a
group of either males or females. We chose to focus on a situ-
ation of subtle sexism because such a situation makes both a
suggestion of sexism and the lack thereof plausible for the
participants. This choice has important implications. Prior
research has shown that exposure to subtle stereotypes or
prejudice creates a "threat in the air," which is associated
with harmful effects on variables related to self-confidence
and to stereotype confirmation (Steele & Aronson, 1995; see
Steele et al., 2002, for a review). As all participants were
exposed to subtle sexism, we expected relatively low scores
on measures assessing these outcomes when no suggestion
of sexism was made. When a suggestion of sexism was
voiced, we expected higher self-confidence and less stereo-
type confirmation, in particular, when the source of the sug-
gestion was male rather than female.
Self-confidence was tapped in Study 1 with a measure of
self-handicapping to which in Study 2 we added a measure
of state performance self-esteem. While personal state
Cihangir et al. 3
performance self-esteem assesses self-confidence quite
directly (Heatherton & Polivy, 1991), self-handicapping
does so more indirectly. People who self-handicap pave the
way for attributions to failure that do not reflect lack of com-
petence, for example, by stressing a momentary physical ill-
ness, lack of effort, or the role of external factors (Jones &
Berglas, 1978; Rhodewalt, 1990). In this sense, and when
associated with the likelihood of failure, self-handicapping is
a form of discounting, but unlike attributional discounting,
discounting through self-handicapping is prophylactic
(Urdan, 2004), but potentially self-destructive. To our knowl-
edge, this outcome has never been studied in the context of
examining the impact of discrimination on its targets and is
thus another novel contribution of this research. Less self-
handicapping is expected when performance is less threaten-
ing to the individual, or when the individual is more confident
in his or her ability to perform well (McCrea, Hirt, & Milner,
2008). We expect this to be the case when male sources voice
a suggestion of sexism. In sum, we expect less self-handicap-
ping (Studies 1 and 2) and higher personal state performance
self-esteem (Study 2) when male sources suggests that sex-
ism has taken place than when female sources make the same
suggestion (Hypothesis 1).
We also included two indicators of stereotype confirma-
tion: stereotypical self-descriptions (Studies 1 and 2) and
task performance (Study 2). In the bogus job-interview para-
digm used in these studies, participants confirm the negative
stereotype of which they were target if they describe them-
selves in line with the female stereotype and if they under-
perform on a task that is presented as a check of whether or
not the interviewer made the correct (gender stereotypical)
decision. In line with research on stereotype threat, we
expected exposure to subtle sexism to lead to stereotype con-
firmation (i.e., more self-stereotyping and poorer task perfor-
mance). We did not expect a suggestion of sexism made by
women to alter this situation. However, we expected less
self-stereotyping and better task performance for participants
who were exposed to male sources who suggested that sex-
ism had taken place (Hypothesis 2).
In both studies, we also measured causal attributions for
the rejection (to lack of competence or to gender discrimina-
tion). We did this to rule out the possibility that the effect of
the source of the suggestion of sexism on self-confidence
and stereotype confirmation would relate to differential attri-
butions of the rejection to discrimination, due to the gender
of the source. Indeed, we expected that in a context of subtle
sexism, any cue that sexism might have taken place should
make such an attribution more likely, irrespective of the
source (Major et al., 2003). Thus, we expected that whether
or not a suggestion of sexism was made would affect attribu-
tional discounting, but this would not depend on the gender
of the source of the suggestion (Hypothesis 3).
In Study 2, we additionally examined the likelihood that
participants would file a complaint against the treatment
received as a function of the manipulations. On one hand, as
social support from ingroup members has been shown to be
an important precursor of (collective) protest (Van Zomeren
et al., 2004), one might expect that a suggestion of sexism
from female sources would make it more likely that partici-
pants would file a complaint than any other condition.
However, because in the situation we examined the focus
was on individual outcomes against which a complaint could
be made, the possibility of collective protest was less salient.
In this type of context, one might also expect that partici-
pants would be more inclined to file a complaint when they
felt best about themselves and their abilities, and were the
least convinced that the stereotype of which they were target
was applicable to the self. If so, then one should expect that
participants would file most complaints when a male source
suggested sexism. Prior research has shown that outgroup
sources are likely to disapprove of complaints that discrimi-
nation has taken place (Dodd, Giuliano, Boutell, & Moran,
2001; Kaiser & Miller, 2001), and that targets tend to refrain
from making such claims in front of outgroup audiences
(Stangor, Swim, Van Allen, & Sechrist, 2002; Swim &
Hyers, 1999). However, research so far has not contemplated
the possibility that this might be different when the sugges-
tion that discrimination has taken place actually stems from
outgroup members. Thus, a novel aspect of the present
research is that we compare the effects of suggested sexism
made by male versus female sources.
Before reporting on the main studies, we describe a pilot
study that was conducted to test whether the method we
developed to manipulate suggestions of sexism from male
versus female sources would differ only in the extent to
which these sources affect perceived pervasiveness of sex-
ism, and not in other relevant ways. It seemed particularly
important to test whether the male and female sources were
seen as equally credible and equally trustworthy. Also, given
existing research on the derogation of women who claim to
be targets of sexism (e.g., Dodd et al., 2001; Kaiser,
Hagiwara, Malahy, & Wilkins, 2009), we assessed whether
male and female sources would be differently evaluated, in
general, or seen as complainers, in particular. We did not
expect this to be the case because, differently from past
research on this topic, the sources in this study were neither
confronting the perpetrator, nor making attributions for their
own outcomes, but instead they were simply suggesting that
sexism might have been a cause for the outcomes received
by the female participant. Still, it seemed important to
directly test whether or not this was the case.
Pilot Study
A total of 61 Dutch females studying at Leiden University,
with an average age of 21.56 (SD = 1.46 years) took part in
this online study. The study was programmed in an online
survey tool designated as NetQ. Participants were approached
by an experimenter and given the link to the online study if
they agreed to participate.
4 SAGE Open
Participants read a vignette describing the context that
would be experienced by participants in the main study.
Participants imagined that they were taking part in a job
interview and subsequently received a negative feedback.
Participants then imagined that they met three other candi-
dates who told them that they thought that the interviewer
might be sexist and that the participants' rejection might
have been due to sexism. For half of the participants, the
source of sexism was three other women, while for the
remaining participants the source was three men. Participants
then answered a range of questions about this vignette.
Specifically, participants indicated the percentage of men
they estimated to be sexist in Dutch society. Participants also
indicated what they thought of the three males/females who
suggested that sexism might have been the cause of the rejec-
tion: their general evaluation of the sources, the extent to
which they were credible, the extent to which their com-
ments reflected what they really thought, and the extent to
which they saw them as trustworthy, sincere, honest, prob-
lematic, difficult, or complainers (all responses were made
on 7-point rating scales ranging from 1 = not at all to 7 = very
much, unless otherwise indicated). Analyses of mean differ-
ences with t tests for independent samples revealed only one
reliable difference between the male and female sources:
When the suggestion of sexism stemmed from a female
source, participants estimated that the majority of Dutch men
were sexist (M = 59.19%, SD = 21.61%), while this dropped
significantly when sexism was suggested by male sources
(M = 44.74%, SD = 26.41%), t(59) = 2.29, p < .05. Male and
female sources were thus seen as equally credible (overall
M = 4.50, SD = 1.50), trustworthy (overall M = 3.96, SD =
1.18), sincere (overall M = 4.55, SD = 1.42), honest (overall
M = 4.57, SD = 1.40), problematic (overall M = 3.58, SD =
1.49), difficult (overall M = 4.25, SD = 1.53), or complainers
(overall M = 4.92, SD = 1.58), and their comments were seen
as reflecting what they really thought to an equal extent
(overall M = 4.78, SD = 1.47). Study 1 employs the same
manipulation of source of sexism and adds as control a con-
dition where the sources do not mention that sexism might
have played a role in their rejection.
Study 1
Method
Design and participants. The study consisted of a 2 (Sugges-
tion of sexism: yes. vs. no) × 2 (Gender of source of the sug-
gestion: male vs. female) between-participants factorial
design. Participants were 78 female students at Leiden Uni-
versity with a mean age of 21. Each session of the experi-
ment lasted approximately 40 min, after which all participants
were fully debriefed and received 4 Euros (approximately
US$5.50) for their participation.
Procedure.All participants were seated in separate cubicles
and were equipped with personal computers. We used a
bogus job-interview paradigm in which participants were
asked to act as though they were being interviewed for a job
to help us train interviewers (see also Cihangir, Barreto, &
Ellemers, 2010). After the computer made a (simulated) con-
nection with the interviewer but prior to the interview, some
personal information about the interviewer was provided to
the participant (Last name and title: Drs. Zomeren; 30 years
old). Next, participants received the 10 interview questions,
which indirectly referred to the participants' gender identity
(e.g., do you dress yourself attractively to influence other
people?). Once the interview was finished, the interviewer
indicated that some time was needed to decide whether the
participant in question would be selected. While they osten-
sibly waited for the interviewer's decision, we told the par-
ticipant that she could use the computer to chat about the
interview with three other participants who allegedly partici-
pated in the same interview procedure. We used three com-
mon Dutch female names in the condition where the source
was female and three common Dutch male names in the con-
dition where the source was male. Participants were then
asked to enter their names into a login screen. Next, they saw
three other names and their own name appearing below a
screen, which contained a chat room. We manipulated the
presence versus absence of a suggestion of sexism by pre-
programming what the three other alleged participants said.
In the condition where others suggested sexism, the mes-
sages made clear that the others "disliked the interview pro-
cedure because it was placing women at a disadvantage,"
"disliked the interviewer who seemed to be unfriendly
toward women," and "thought the interview questions were
not appropriate for women who were applying for the posi-
tion." In the condition where no suggestion of sexism was
made, the others indicated that they "approved of the inter-
view procedure because it seemed appropriate," "considered
the interviewer to be an experienced person to conduct this
kind of interview," and "found the interview questions appro-
priate for selecting people for this kind of position." In both
conditions, we also included information in the messages
that was unrelated to the selection procedure (e.g., "I feel like
having a coffee, anyone joining me when this is finished?"),
to increase credibility and to avoid suspicion about the goals
of the study. After three rounds of information exchange, the
session was ended and the participants were asked to answer
some questions about the other people with whom they had
supposedly been chatting. This included some filler ques-
tions and questions that were meant to check for the effec-
tiveness of the manipulation of the suggestion of sexism.
Next, we told participants that the interviewer had come to a
decision and the connection with the interviewer was
renewed. In all conditions, the interviewer told participants,
"I am sorry to inform you that you are not selected. You did
not answer the crucial questions properly." We used this
ambiguous rejection on the basis of gender-biased interview
questions in all conditions to induce subtle sexism (see
Cihangir et al., 2010). After participants read that they were
Cihangir et al. 5
rejected, the connection with the interviewer was supposedly
terminated, and the participants were asked to answer a set of
questions about the interview procedure (manipulation
checks and dependent variables). We explained that these
questions could serve to improve the selection procedure,
assured participants that neither the interviewer nor the other
interviewees could see their answers, and urged them to
respond honestly to all questions.
Dependent variables. All responses were made on 7-point rat-
ing scales ranging from (1) not at all to (7) very much, unless
otherwise indicated. We checked for the effectiveness of the
manipulation of the suggestion of sexism by asking partici-
pants to what degree others were critical of the interviewer,
of the interview procedure, and of the interview questions
(last item recoded;  = .99). To check the effectiveness of the
source manipulation, we asked participants to indicate the
gender of the other interviewees with whom they had been
chatting. Participants' own attributions to discrimination
were measured with four items (the selection decision that
was made was the result of gender discrimination, this selec-
tion procedure disadvantages women, there was clearly dis-
crimination in this procedure, the selection made was due to
prejudiced questions,  = .91), and attributions to (lack of)
personal competence were measured with two items (the
selection decision that was made was due to my perfor-
mance/to my competence, r = .39, p = <.001). A principal
components analysis confirmed that attributions to discrimi-
nation and attributions to personal competence loaded on dif-
ferent factors that together explained 76.32% of variance in
the individual items (all items loaded at least .82 on their
respective factor).
The measurement of self-handicapping is best achieved,
if it refers to an upcoming task. Accordingly, we first
informed participants that we were interested in ascertaining
to what extent the interviewer had made a correct decision
and that they would be asked to perform an additional task
to help us do that (see also Cihangir et al., 2010). We told
participants that we needed some information about them-
selves before they could start working on the task. The ques-
tions for additional information contained the
self-handicapping and self-stereotyping measures. Self-
handicapping was measured with 12 items adapted from
Rhodewalt (1990; see also Cihangir et al., 2010), which
consisted of items such as "I am nervous about the upcom-
ing test," "I am easily distracted during this type of test," or
"I am hungry" ( = .80). The self-stereotyping measure con-
sisted of nine female stereotypical traits, which were adapted
from the Dutch version of the Bem sex roles inventory
(Bem, 1974; Willemsen & Fischer, 1997). The traits were as
follows: dependent, considerate, understanding, indecisive,
emotional, over-sensitive, romantic, sentimental, and caring
( = .68). Once participants had answered these questions
the experiment ended, participants were debriefed and com-
pensated for their participation.
Results
Unless otherwise indicated, all variables were analyzed with
a 2 (Suggestion of sexism: yes vs. no) × 2 (Gender of source
of suggestion of sexism: male vs. female) between-
participants ANOVA.
Manipulation checks.Participants indicated that the three
other interviewees were more critical of the procedure, the
interviewer, and the interview questions when they sug-
gested sexism (M = 6.69, SD = 0.40), than when they did not
(M = 1.58, SD = 0.68), F(1, 74) = 1,616.18, p < .0001, p
2
=
.96. All participants (100%) correctly indicated the gender of
other interviewees with whom they had been chatting. The
manipulation of the suggestion of sexism and the manipula-
tion of gender of source can thus be considered successful.
Attributions. Participant's own attributions of the outcome to
discrimination and to (lack of) personal competence were
analyzed with a MANOVA. This analysis revealed a multi-
variate main effect of the suggestion of sexism, F(2, 73) =
13.35, p < .001, p
2
= .27, which at the univariate level was
reliable for both dependent variables. As expected, partici-
pants attributed their rejection more to gender discrimination
when others had suggested sexism (M = 4.47, SD = 1.29)
than when they had not (M = 3.31, SD = 1.40), F(1, 74) =
10.95, p < .001, p
2
= .13. Also, participants attributed their
rejection less to (lack of) personal competence when others
had suggested sexism (M = 2.76, SD = 1.37) than when they
had not (M = 3.71, SD = 1.19), F(1, 74) = 14.20, p < .001,
p
2
= .16. Importantly, as predicted in Hypothesis 3, these
effects were not qualified by an interaction with the source of
the suggestion. In line with prior work in this area (e.g.,
Major et al., 2003), we also examined the extent to which
participants discounted their personal responsibility by sub-
tracting attributions to lack of personal competence from
attributions to gender discrimination. Higher scores on this
measure therefore indicate greater discounting. Discounting
was also only reliably affected by the manipulation of others'
comments, F(1, 74) = 27.03, p < .001, p
2
= .27. Discounting
scores were reliably above 0 when others suggested discrimi-
nation (M = 1.72, SD =1.67), t(38) = 6.42, p < .001, and equal
to 0 (suggesting uncertainty about the cause of the rejection)
when others did not suggest gender discrimination (M =
-.39; SD =1.95), t(38) = 1.25, ns.
Self-handicapping. We submitted the self-handicapping mea-
sure to a between-participants ANOVA. This analysis
revealed only a reliable two-way interaction between the two
factors, F(1, 74) = 8.43, p < .005, p
2
= .10. Table 1 displays
the means, as well as the simple effects.As indicated in Table
1, and as predicted in Hypothesis 1, participants self-handi-
capped less when men suggested discrimination than when
women did so. Also, whereas a suggestion of sexism by
female sources led to more self-handicapping than when
6 SAGE Open
female sources did not suggest sexism (an effect akin to that
found by Adams et al., 2006, on a different measure), the
opposite was found when the sources were male: A sugges-
tion of sexism by male sources led to less self-handicapping
than when the male sources did not suggest sexism.
Self-stereotyping. AnANOVAon this measure only revealed a
reliable interaction between the two factors, F(1, 74) = 7.47,
p < .01, p
2
= .09. Inspection of means and simple effects
(see Table 1) indicates that, as predicted in Hypothesis 2, par-
ticipants self-stereotyped less when a male source suggested
discrimination than when a female source suggested discrim-
ination. There was no such source effect when there was no
suggestion of discrimination. Moreover, when the source
was female a suggestion of sexism led to more self-stereo-
typing than when no such suggestion was made, whereas
when the source was male, a suggestion of sexism led to less
self-stereotyping than when no suggestion of sexism was
made. Although this is consistent with our reasoning that a
suggestion of sexism made by female versus male sources
can have quite different and even opposite effects, these two
simple effects were only marginally reliable (in both cases,
p = .06).
Discussion
In line with our hypotheses, the results of this study indicate
that the effect of a suggestion of sexism on self-confidence
and stereotype confirmation is moderated by the gender of
the source of this suggestion. When men suggested that sex-
ism had taken place, participants reported less self-handicap-
ping and less self-stereotyping than when the same suggestion
was made by female sources. Also, consistent with the find-
ings reported by Adams et al. (2006), a suggestion of sexism
by a female source was even counter-productive, leading to
more self-handicapping and more self-stereotyping than
when no such suggestion was made. A novel contribution of
the present research is that a suggestion of sexism by a male
source had self-protective effects, in that it led to less self-
handicapping and less self-stereotyping than no suggestion
of sexism--although admittedly this contrast was only mar-
ginally reliable for self-stereotyping.
It is also important to note that a suggestion of sexism (vs.
no suggestion) was equally influential of participants' attri-
butions, irrespective of the gender of the source. That is, the
effect of the gender of the source of the suggestion cannot be
attributed to a heightened (or reduced) awareness that sex-
ism might have taken place. Instead, we propose that a sug-
gestion of sexism can provide targets with an opportunity to
protect their self-confidence but only when it is accompanied
by the demonstration that male hostility toward women is not
inevitable. While prior research has shown a similar effect by
varying the extent to which sexism was described as rare or
as pervasive (Schmitt et al., 2003; Stroebe et al., 2011), our
research shows that the impact of people's exposure to an
identical sexist treatment can also differ, depending on who
acknowledges the possibility of sexism.
Although our focus in this study was on how source modi-
fies the effects of a suggestion of sexism, we included as
control two conditions in which male or female sources did
not suggest that sexism might have been a cause for the
rejection. We found an inversion of the source effect in these
conditions, such that female participants self-handicapped
and self-stereotyped to a greater extent when the others were
males than when they were females. Although at first sight
this might seem inconsistent with prior research on stereo-
type threat, it is important to note that this study was not
designed to test stereotype threat effects, so it does not
include the standard "no threat" condition which makes such
comparisons possible. Indeed, gender stereotypes were made
salient in all conditions, through the gender-biased interview
questions used by the interviewer. Instead, the pattern we
found is in fact consistent with prior research, showing that
the mere presence of men can be threatening for women, as
they anticipate being devalued by them--as long as there is
no explicit information to contradict this (e.g., Inzlicht &
Ben-Zeev, 2000; Sekaquaptewa & Thomson, 2003). This can
lead to lower self-confidence and poorer performance com-
pared with a situation in which no men are present. This
explanation and findings of prior research are consistent with
the source effects we obtained in this research when no sug-
gestion of sexism was made. Importantly however, these
processes emerge due to the inferences women make about
men's attitudes toward them when more concrete informa-
tion about their attitudes is lacking. Consequently, such
inferences become irrelevant when participants are explicitly
told what the male sources really think--in our research, this
was the case when the men present suggested that sexism
may have taken place.
Study 2
Study 2 was designed to replicate and extend Study 1 with a
slightly different experimental manipulation and additional
measures. In Study 1, we compared what happened when

others suggested that sexism had taken place with what hap-
pened when others approved of the selection procedure. In
Study 2, sexism was mentioned in all conditions, but it was
either suggested that sexism had played a role or that it had
not. This allows us to further examine whether merely men-
tioning sexism might lead to self-protective effects (by rais-
ing awareness that it is a possible cause of the negative
outcome), or whether the effects observed indeed depend on
other people's suggestions as to whether or not sexism may
have played a role (the way others judge the situation), as
well as whether these others are male or female, as we pre-
dicted. An additional goal of Study 2 was to relate these
novel findings to two indicators of self-confidence and of
stereotype confirmation that are commonly used in this lit-
erature: personal self-esteem and task performance. As in
Study 1, we expected to find less self-handicapping and
higher self-esteem (as indicators of self-confidence,
Hypothesis 1) but also less self-stereotyping and better task
performance (as indicators of stereotype (dis-)confirmation,
Hypothesis 2) when a suggestion of sexism is made by male
sources than when it is made by female sources.
Similar to Study 1, we expected more attributions to dis-
crimination and less attributions to personal failure when
others suggest sexism than when others deny sexist treat-
ment, and anticipated that this would occur regardless of
who makes this suggestion (Hypothesis 3). Finally, we
examined the extent to which participants would file a com-
plaint against their treatment, as an additional indicator of
how others'suggestions affect the way targets respond to dis-
criminatory treatment.
Method
Design and participants. The study followed a 2 (Suggestion
of sexism: yes vs. no) × 2 (Gender of the source of the sug-
gestion of sexism: male vs. female) between-participants
factorial design. Participants were 90 female students at
Leiden University with a mean age of 20. Each session of the
experiment lasted approximately 45 min, after which all par-
ticipants were fully debriefed and received 4.50 Euros
(approximately US$6.22) for their participation.
Procedure. The procedure of this study was identical to that
of Study 1, except that in the "no suggestion of sexism" con-
dition instead of others simply approving of the procedure,
they explicitly indicated that no sexism had taken place. Spe-
cifically, in this condition others allegedly indicated that they
"liked the interview procedure because the procedure was
well designed for women as well as for men," that they "liked
the interviewer who seemed to be friendly towards women,"
and that "the interview questions seemed appropriate for
women who were applying for the position."
Dependent measures.All responses were made on 7-point
rating scales ranging from (1) not at all to (7) very much. The
effectiveness of the manipulations was checked with the
same items as in Study 1 (three item checked the manipula-
tion of others' comments,  = .97 and one item checked the
gender of the source). The same scales as in Study 1 were
used to measure attributions (attributions to discrimination:
 = .94; attributions to [lack of] personal competence: r =
.39, p < .001).
We used an abbreviated version of the self-handicapping
scale used in Study 1 (five items;  = .64) and the same self-
stereotyping scale as in Study 1 ( = .68). We measured per-
formance state self-esteem (PSSE) with items from the
Heatherton and Polivy (1991) State Performance Self-
Esteem subscale ( = .80). We assessed performance in an
IQ-test consisting of 15 items that were selected from exist-
ing IQ-test questions. All participants received 10 min to
complete the task. We stressed that this performance task
would help us evaluate the decision of the interviewer and
that their performance on this task would potentially enable
the participant to be selected despite the interviewers' deci-
sion. After they finished this task (or after the time allotted
for this task had elapsed), we presented participants with a
binary choice to communicate whether or not they wanted to
file a complaint against the selection decision ("Yes, I wish
to complain" or "No, I do not wish to complain"). At this
stage, participants who indicated a wish to file a complaint
were actually provided the opportunity to do so by complet-
ing and submitting a message indicating their protest about
the interview procedure via the computer. That is, partici-
pants were given the chance to complain at the very end of
the study, after having responded to all other questions and
performed the task. The possibility to file a complaint was
not mentioned to participants before they reached this final
stage of the study. Participants who did not file a complaint
were given the score 0, while participants who submitted a
complaint were given the score 1.
Results
All variables were analyzed with a 2 (Suggestion of sexism:
yes vs. no) × 2 (Source: male vs. female) between-partici-
pants (multivariate) ANOVA, unless otherwise indicated.
Manipulation check. Participants reported that the three other
interviewees were more satisfied with the procedure, with
the interviewer, and with the interview questions when they
denied sexism (M = 6.42, SD = 0.70) than when they sug-
gested sexism (M = 1.47, SD = 0.74), F(2, 86) = 1,039.73,
p < .0001, p
2
= .92. All participants correctly indicated the
gender of the other interviewees with whom they had been
chatting. The manipulation of the suggestion of sexism and
the manipulation of source of influence can be considered
successful.
Attributions. We submitted attributions to discrimination and
attributions to personal competence to a between-partici-
pants MANOVA. These analyses revealed a multivariate
main effect of the suggestion of sexism, F(2, 85) = 8.59,
8 SAGE Open
p < .001, p
2 = .17, which at the univariate level was only
reliable for attributions to discrimination, F(1, 86) = 17.20,
p < .001, p
2 = .17, and not to attributions to personal com-
petence, F(1, 86) = 1.66, ns, p
2 = .02. As predicted, and
consistent with the results of Study 1, participants attributed
their rejection more to gender discrimination when others
suggested sexism (M = 4.68, SD = 1.38) than when others did
not (M = 3.31, SD = 1.71). The analysis of the discounting
score also revealed that discounting was only reliably
affected by the manipulation of others'comments, F(1, 86) =
12.89, p < .01, p
2
= .13. Discounting scores were reliably
above 0 when others suggested discrimination (M = 2.02,
SD =1.78), t(44) = 7.60, p < .001, and equal to 0 (suggesting
uncertainty about the cause of the rejection) when others did
not (M = .27; SD =2.27), t(44) = .66, ns. Consistent with
Study 1 and in line with Hypothesis 3, these main effects
were not qualified by gender of the source.
Self-handicapping and PSSE. The two indicators of self-confi-
dence were analyzed with a between-participants MANOVA,
which only revealed a reliable interaction between the two
factors, F(2, 85) = 4.30, p < .05, p
2
= .09. At the univariate
level, this interaction was reliable for both measures, self-
handicapping, F(1, 86) = 4.19, p < .05, p
2
= .05; PSSE,
F(1, 86) = 7.99, p < .01, p
2
= .09. Inspection of means and
simple effects (Table 2) confirmed that female participants
self-handicapped reliably more when women suggested sex-
ism than when men suggested sexism, whereas there was no
effect of source when no suggestion of sexism was made. In
addition, when the source was female, a suggestion of sex-
ism led to (marginally) more self-handicapping than when no
suggestion of sexism was made. No other contrasts were reli-
able for this measure.
With regard to self-esteem, the results show that female
participants reported reliably lower self-esteem when women
suggested sexism than when men suggested sexism, whereas
there was no effect of source when no suggestion of sexism
was made (see Table 2 for the means and the indication of the
reliability of simple effects). In addition, when the source
was female, a suggestion of sexism led to lower self-esteem
than when no suggestion of sexism was made, whereas when
the source was male a suggestion of sexism led to higher
self-esteem than when no suggestion was made. This is con-
sistent with our hypotheses and with the results of Study 1.
Self-stereotyping and task performance. We submitted the two
stereotype confirmation measures to a between-participants
MANOVA. This analysis only revealed a multivariate inter-
action between the two factors, F(2, 85) = 4.33, p < .05,
p
2
= .09. At the univariate level, this effect was reliable for
both measures, self-stereotyping, F(1, 86) = 4.47, p < .05,
p
2
= .05; performance, F(1, 86) = 5.04, p < .05, p
2
= .06.
Inspection of means and simple effects (see Table 2) revealed
that when discrimination was suggested by men, female par-
ticipants reported lower levels of self-stereotyping than when
it was suggested by women, while when sexism was not sug-
gested, the gender of the source did not affect self-stereotyp-
ing. No other contrasts were reliable for this measure.
With regard to task performance, the results showed that
when men suggested sexism, female participants showed
reliably better task performance than when women made the
same suggestion, while there was no such effect of source
when sexism was not suggested (see Table 2 for means and
simple effects). In addition, when the source was male, a
suggestion of sexism led to better performance than when no
suggestion of sexism was made. No other contrasts were reli-
able for this measure.
Filing a complaint.Logistic regression on the dichotomous
scores of complaints filed revealed a reliable interaction
between the suggestion of sexism and gender of source, B =
1.87, Wald's 2(1, N = 90) = 4.50, p < .05. When men sug-
gested sexism, participants were more likely to file a com-
plaint than when women did so, B = -1.59, Wald's 2(1, N =
45) = 6.09, p < .05. Filing a complaint was not affected by
gender of the source when sexism was not suggested, B =
0.28, Wald's 2(1, N = 45) = .22, ns. Also, participants filled
more complaints if a male source suggested than if it did not
suggest sexism, although this was only marginally reliable,
B = 1.13, Wald's 2(1, N = 45) = 3.21, p = .07. Whether a
female source suggested or did not suggest, sexism did not
affect the extent to which complaints were filled, B = -.74,
Wald's 2(1, N = 45) = 1.44, ns.
Discussion
The results of this study replicate and extend the results of
Study 1 with a slightly different procedure and additional
measures. In line with Hypotheses 1 and 2, the results again
indicate that a suggestion of sexism from a male source has
more beneficial effects on targets than a suggestion of sexism

from a female source. This study established this effect on
the same variables used in Study 1 to assess self-confidence
and stereotype confirmation but also extended it to two addi-
tional indicators that are commonly studied in this literature:
personal state performance self-esteem and task perfor-
mance. When male sources suggested that participants might
have been targets of sexism, participants self-handicapped
less, reported higher personal state performance self-esteem,
self-stereotyped less, and performed better than when the
exact same suggestion was made by female sources. Because
this study compared the suggestion of sexism with a condi-
tion in which the possibility of sexism was also mentioned
but rejected by others, this provides further evidence that the
effects observed are indeed caused by other people's judg-
ments of the situation­not by the mere fact that targets are
made aware of the possibility of sexism.
In a different way, in line with the findings of Study 1 and
those reported by Adams et al. (2006), our findings also indi-
cate that a suggestion of sexism by a female source can even
be counter-productive as it lowers self-esteem and (margin-
ally) increases self-handicapping. Again, new to this article
but in replication of what we found in Study 1, a suggestion
of sexism by male sources had quite the opposite effect,
increasing self-esteem and improving task performance,
compared with when no suggestion of sexism was made.
As in Study 1, gender of source did not affect causal attri-
butions, or attributional discounting, which only depended
on whether or not a suggestion of sexism was made. Again,
this excludes the possibility that the effects observed are
driven by differences in participants' own perceptions of the
situation, in line with our reasoning. Importantly, this study
also extended the findings of Study 1 by showing that targets
were most likely to file a complaint about the way they were
treated when they had heard a suggestion of sexism from a
male source. This supports the idea that when male sources
suggest sexist treatment, this creates an environment where
sexism is condemned and complaints of sexism are not nec-
essarily frowned upon (Blanchard et al., 1994). In such cir-
cumstances, female targets are less likely to expect to endure
social costs for filing their complaints. This is not communi-
cated when a female source suggests that sexism has taken
place because women's reactions are not the ones that are
feared by female targets of sexism (Dodd et al., 2001; Kaiser
& Miller, 2001).
General Discussion
Suggestions of sexism have the potential both to harm and to
protect their targets. Whether one or the other effect will take
place is likely to depend on a range of variables (see Major et
al., 2003, for a review). The studies reported in this article
extend prior research by indicating that when others suggest
sexism may have played a role, this can have different effects
depending on whether these others are men or women.
Results of a pilot study showed that a suggestion of sexism
made by men led to lower perceived pervasiveness of sexism
than a suggestion of sexism made by women. Importantly,
male sources of a suggestion of sexism were not perceived
differently than female sources on a range of measures tap-
ping into their credibility, trustworthiness, general evalua-
tion, and impression as difficult, problematic, or complainers.
Moreover, the results of the main studies show that a sugges-
tion of sexism from male sources was associated with higher
self-confidence and less stereotype confirmation, than when
the very same suggestion was made by female sources. This
is consistent with the proposition that a suggestion of sexism
introduces a social identity threat that includes the idea that
men are generally hostile toward women (Adams et al.,
2006). If this is indeed true, then such a threat should be
reduced when there is evidence that men can instead be allies
against sexism. This is what happens when a male source
suggests that a female might have been the target of sexism.
In this situation, the threat experienced by the suggestion of
sexism must be measured against the potential this sugges-
tion has to protect target's self-confidence. When the sugges-
tionstemmedfrommalesources,ourparticipantsexperienced
a lift in self-confidence compared with when the suggestion
was made by female sources. This is also what happened in
earlier studies when gender discrimination was either
described as rare or as pervasive: Although discrimination
described as pervasive was mainly harmful, targets were
willing to reap the benefit of discrimination that was
described as rare to protect their self-image (e.g., Schmitt et
al., 2003; Stroebe et al., 2011). The current studies extend
this past research because instead of varying how discrimina-
tion was described, we merely varied who suggested that it
might have taken place.
It is important to note that self-confidence and stereotype
confirmation were neither affected by any main effects of the
group membership of the source, nor by main effects of the
suggestion of sexism, but only revealed reliable interactions
between the two factors. This is consistent with our theoreti-
cal reasoning and rules out the possibility that results might
have been simply due to effects of gender of source on
salience of gender identity or of the suggestion of sexism on
generalized mood.
These studies also extend past research by illuminating
some of the factors that might facilitate complaints of dis-
crimination. At first sight, this finding may seem inconsistent
with work showing that support from fellow ingroup mem-
bers is an important factor in people's decision to engage in
protest (Klandermans, 1997). However, this previous work
focused on engagement in collective protest and participa-
tion in the activities of political interest groups, which is dif-
ferent from the situation we studied. Notably, we studied a
job-interview context in which people only are informed
about their individual treatment and individual outcomes,
and where collective action was not an option. In such situa-
tions occurring in real life, participants could individually
file a complaint if they did not agree with the way they were
10 SAGE Open
treated. Thus, our findings complement prior work: Whereas
support from other ingroup members may facilitate partici-
pation in collective protest, the current results suggest that
support from the outgroup may help people protest against
their individual treatment. This extends past evidence show-
ing that people are reluctant to report the discrimination of
which they are target (e.g., Swim & Hyers, 1999), especially
to outgroup members (Sechrist, Swim, & Stangor, 2004),
and that this is likely to be linked to the social costs that are
associated with making such claims, particularly to members
of the outgroup (Dodd et al., 2001; Kaiser & Miller, 2001).
We found that our female participants were most likely to file
a complaint when they heard male sources suggest that they
might have been targets of sexism than when they heard
female sources make the same suggestion. Thus, female tar-
gets were more likely to file complaints of discrimination,
when it was clear that at least some outgroup members would
be likely to support their claims. This suggests that social
support from dominant group members may be just as impor-
tant as social support from ingroup members (the latter illus-
trated, for example, by Van Zomeren et al., 2004)--albeit for
different reasons--and underlines the important role of out-
group allies in promoting social change.
There are admittedly some limitations to this research.
First, although the manipulation of gender of source (male
vs. female) is rather self-evident, the effects obtained are
likely to stem from expectations about the prevalence of sex-
ism that were only measured in the pilot study. As such, it
was not possible to test their mediating role. Now that we
have established that male versus female sources have a dif-
ferent impact on the way targets respond to sexism, future
research can further investigate the mediating processes
associated with these differential effects. Second, our
research only presented the opinion of a relatively small
(three individuals) group of males versus females, who were
present in the same context. While this type of situation is
likely to occur in real life (e.g., with one's direct colleagues
commenting on events and decisions in the workplace), it is
also possible that similar comments are voiced by a single
individual (e.g., one's partner or best friend), by mixed gen-
der sources (where people might be particularly sensitive to
the opinion of males present in this group), or by larger
groups of people who form their opinion based on the
account provided by the target instead of witnessing the situ-
ation themselves. Future research might explore whether the
suggestion of sexism can also impact on targets' responses
when voiced by these different types of sources. Finally, it is
important to note that these studies focused on a situation of
subtle sexism, and our findings must be understood in this
context. We think that this is valid, because this is the type of
sexism that is currently most prevalent and also most perni-
cious in the effects it has on its targets. Nevertheless, future
research might examine whether similar effects are obtained
when a suggestion of sexism appears less plausible, or
whether targets' responses are equally dependent on the
opinions of others when the occurrence of sexism is more
unambiguous. In addition, the targets in the current study
were female university students who faced gender discrimi-
nation despite their educational qualifications. Replications
of the current effects in other contexts with targets from dif-
ferent social backgrounds could improve the robustness and
validity of our effects in other types of situations where sex-
ism might play a role. Also, the current study focused on
gender of the source as an explanatory variable of interest.
Future research might additionally examine other explana-
tory variables that might moderate the impact of suggesting
sexist treatment, such as prior career experiences of the tar-
get, or social support received from family or friends (see
Barreto, Ellemers, Cihangir, & Stroebe, 2009; Schmitt,
Branscombe, Postmes, & Garcia, in press, for a meta analytic
review on the effects of perceived discrimination on
well-being).
In sum, this research demonstrates that men can constitute
important allies against sexism not only because perpetrators
are more likely to feel bad about their sexist beliefs when
confronted by males (as documented by Czopp & Monteith,
2003) but also because a suggestion of sexism from male
sources is more beneficial for its targets and potentially more
instrumental in reducing gender inequalities.
