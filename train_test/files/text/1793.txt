BACKGROUND: The National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) has monitored total ho-
mocysteine (tHcy) concentrations in a nationally-rep-
resentative sample of the US population since 1991.
Until recently, however, data could not be compared
across survey periods because of changes in analytical
methods and specimen matrices. Such an analysis of
these data could supplement current knowledge re-
garding whether the US folic acid fortification program
has modified national plasma tHcy concentrations.
METHODS: We examined tHcy data in the prefortifica-
tion NHANES III survey (phase II, 1991­1994) and in 3
postfortification survey periods (1999­2000, 2001­
2002, and 2003­2004). We applied method adjustment
equations to the survey data based on method compar-
ison studies of separate samples. Persons with chronic
kidney disease were excluded from the analyses.
RESULTS: Mean plasma tHcy concentrations decreased
by 8%, 9%, and 10% for adolescent, adult, and older
men and by 6%, 3%, and 13% for women, respectively,
from before to after fortification. Concentrations re-
mained unchanged between the first and third postfor-
tification survey periods. Prevalence estimates of in-
creased plasma tHcy concentrations (13 mol/L) for
older men and women decreased from prefortification
(32% and 20%, respectively) to postfortification (14%
and 5%, respectively) but remained unchanged there-
after (16% and 14%, respectively [males] and 5% and
9%, respectively [females]).
CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for method changes, we
quantified a prefortification to postfortification de-
crease in circulating tHcy concentrations of about 10%
in a national sample of the US population. This change
is similar to effects seen in intervention trials with folic
acid and in smaller observational studies.

Genetic variations in enzymes involved in homocys-
teine metabolism; inadequate intakes of folate, ribofla-
vin, vitamins B6 or B12; and impaired renal function
lead to increased total homocysteine (tHcy)5 concen-
trations in blood (1). Concentrations are also in-
creased by behaviors such as smoking, lack of exercise,
excessive alcohol intake, and high coffee consumption
(2). Alhough tHcy concentrations have been positively
associated with cardiovascular disease in early observa-
tional studies (3), subsequent prospective population
studies (4) and folate intervention trials (5) have sug-
gested a weaker or even tenuous relationship. Results
from pooled analysis of additional clinical trials are ex-
pected to overcome the current lack of statistical power
to detect small effects (6). Thus far, however, there ap-
pears to be evidence of the efficacy of folic acid supple-

mentation in the prevention of stroke (7). Increased
concentrations of tHcy have also been associated with
the development of dementia, Alzheimer disease, and
cognitive dysfunction; decline in physical function;
and osteoporosis and fractures in elderly individuals
(1).
Since January 1998, the US Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has required fortification of enriched ce-
real-grain products with folic acid to reduce the risk of
pregnancy complicated by neural tube defects (NTD)
(8). Recent observational studies have suggested asso-
ciations between folate fortification in the US popula-
tion and reduced NTD rates (9), decreased prevalence
of inadequate serum and erythrocyte folate concentra-
tions (10­13), and decreases in the incidence of stroke
(14). Decreases in tHcy concentrations were reported
in the Framingham (12) and Chilean populations (15)
after introduction of folate fortification in the US and
in Chile.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) began to monitor tHcy concen-
trations in the US population in 1991. Several papers
have described distributions of tHcy concentrations
(16, 17) and their determinants (18­20) obtained by
measurements performed on surplus serum from the
second phase of NHANES III (1991­1994). In 1999,
continuous monitoring of plasma tHcy concentrations
was implemented. At present, data are available for 3
postfortification survey periods: 1999­2000, 2001­
2002, and 2003­2004. Several reports have presented
information about tHcy concentrations for the first 2
survey periods (10, 11, 21, 22). However, the use of
different laboratories, methods, and specimen matrices
for the measurement of tHcy has precluded direct
comparison of tHcy results from prefortification to
postfortification (23), as well as among the 3 post-
fortification survey periods. We describe the method
adjustments necessary to allow comparison of tHcy
data across time, and we provide an account of changes
in tHcy concentrations in the US population over the
last 13 years.
Study Participants and Methods
SURVEY DESIGN AND STUDY PARTCIPANTS
NHANES constitutes a series of periodic nationally
representative cross-sectional probability surveys of
the noninstitutionalized civilian US population. Con-
ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
NHANES obtains a stratified, multistage, probability
sample designed to represent the US population based
on age, sex, and race-ethnicity (24). During each sur-
vey period, certain subpopulations are oversampled to
allow for more precise estimates. Race-ethnicity cate-
gories [non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic
black (NHB), and Mexican-American (MA)] are based
on self-reported data (25). All respondents gave their
informed consent, and the NHANES protocol for each
survey period was reviewed and approved by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review
Board.
LABORATORY METHODS
Methods for determining tHcy concentrations changed
across the 4 survey periods (see Supplemental Table 1 in
theDataSupplementthataccompaniestheonlineversion
of this article at http://www.clinchem.org/content/vol54/
issue5). Because optimally prepared EDTA plasma was
not available during NHANES III, tHcy concentrations
were analyzed by HPLC in surplus serum from phase II
of NHANES III (1991­1994) at the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) Human Nutrition Research Center
on Aging (26). Whole blood was allowed to clot for
30­60 min before centrifugation and removal of serum.
From 1999­2004, EDTA whole blood was processed
within 30 min of collection to avoid an artificial increase
in tHcy from continuous production in, and release
from erythrocytes. Plasma tHcy was analyzed at the CDC
Nutrition Laboratory using a commercial fluorescence
polarization immunoassay reagent set (Abbott Labora-
tories) on the Abbott IMx® analyzer during 1999­2001
(27),thenontheAbbottAxSYM®analyzer(samereagent
set, newer fully-automated model) during 2002­2004
(28). Interrun CVs for plasma tHcy at 6.70­26.0 mol/L
were 3%­5% for both Abbott platforms during
1999­2004.
METHODS ADJUSTMENTS
We adjusted all tHcy data forward to the Abbott
AxSYM® because that method was used for the longest
time period in NHANES and is the most widely used
method in clinical laboratories. Owing to error in both
analytical methods, we performed method adjust-
ments by Deming regression analysis using Analyze-it,
a statistical plug-in for Microsoft Excel (Analyze-it
Software), after log-transforming the data to account
for nongaussian distributions.
Because a different specimen matrix was used for
NHANES III and no direct method comparison data
were available between the USDA HPLC and the Ab-
bott AxSYM method, we adjusted tHcy data from
NHANES III in 3 stages: USDA HPLC serum to USDA
HPLC plasma; USDA HPLC plasma to CDC HPLC
plasma; and CDC HPLC plasma to AxSYM® plasma.
The first 2 adjustments were based on data from an
earlier report (23) in which USDA and CDC laborato-
ries performed a method comparison of their 2 HPLC
assays (26, 29) to determine the magnitude of differ-
802 Clinical Chemistry 54:5 (2008)
ences in tHcy concentrations between plasma and se-
rum. Blood specimens from 30 donors were separated
into EDTA plasma (optimal processing) and serum
(delayed processing) (23). For the serum-to-plasma
data adjustment, we used the USDA data for serum
after allowing the blood to clot for 60 min (n  30). For
the USDA HPLC plasma­to­CDC HPLC plasma data
adjustment, we used the entire sample set (n  150).
Finally, the CDC HPLC­to­AxSYM conversion was
based on a set of plasma samples that were measured as
part of NHANES with these 2 methods and the IMx
method (n  361). Therefore, the data from this sam-
ple set were also used to compare the 2 Abbott
platforms.
STATISTICAL METHODS
Statistical analyses on method adjusted tHcy data were
performed using SAS (version 9, SAS Institute) and
SUDAAN (version 9, RTI) software using sample
weights to account for differences in nonresponse or
noncoverage and to adjust for planned oversampling of
some groups (24). The 95% CIs for all survey periods
were estimated with SUDAAN software by using Tay-
lor series linearization, a method that incorporates the
sample weights and accounts for the sample design. We
used 3 age strata in our data analyses: 12­19 years (ad-
olescents), 20­59 years (adults), and 60 years (older
persons).
Because impaired renal function has an apprecia-
ble influence on plasma tHcy concentrations (30), data
were excluded from analyses for all participants with
chronic kidney disease (CKD) of any stage (568, 532,
613, and 620 persons in 1991­1994, 1999­2000, 2001­
2002, and 2003­2004, respectively) and persons for
whom insufficient information was available to deter-
mine whether they had CKD (127, 73, 77, and 84 per-
sons, respectively). We followed the recommendations
of the National Kidney Disease Education Program to
estimate glomerular filtration rate as the best overall
index of kidney function (31, 32) and used the Na-
tional Kidney Foundation classification system to de-
termine stages of CKD (33)(see Supplemental Text 1 in
the online Data Supplement).
We generated frequency distribution curves for
the entire population and for older persons for each
survey period. Medians or geometric means (log10
-
transformed data) were evaluated owing to the skew-
ness of the distribution curves. Prevalence estimates for
individuals with increased tHcy concentrations (13
mol/L) (12, 15) and individuals with desirable tHcy
concentrations (9 mol/L) (34) were determined for
each survey period.
Using an ANOVA model that included age (3 age
groups), sex (male or female), racial-ethnic group
(NHW, NHB, MA, or other), and survey period (1991­
1994, 1999­2000, 2001­2002, or 2003­2004), we
found significant (P  0.05) age  survey period and
sex  survey period interactions. To assess whether
circulating tHcy concentrations (geometric means) or
prevalence estimates changed between consecutive
survey periods (i.e., 1991­1994 compared with 1999­
2000, 1999­2000 compared with 2001­2002, and
2001­2002 compared with 2003­2004), and to assess
whether prevalence estimates of increased or desirable
tHcy values were significantly different between the 3
age groups (i.e., 12­19 years compared with 20­50
years, 20­59 years compared with 60 years, and 60
years compared with 12­19 years), we performed pair-
wise comparisons using 2-tailed, 2-group t tests on age-
and sex-specific subgroups. We considered the P value
of each comparison significant if it was 0.017 (Bon-
ferroni multiple comparison adjustment, 0.05 divided
by 3, the total number of comparisons). We deter-
mined selected population percentile values (5th, 50th,
and 95th) for tHcy for the prefortification period
(1991­1994) and for the postfortification period
(1999­2004). Strata with 220 individuals were con-
sidered to produce imprecise estimates of the 5th and
95th percentiles (35).
Results
METHOD ADJUSTMENTS
USDA HPLC plasma results (n  30) were on average
9% lower than their serum results, with a constant rel-
ative difference across all concentrations; all predicted
plasma results were within 15% of the measured results
(Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1A in the online Data
Supplement for Deming regression plot). CDC HPLC
plasma results (n  150) were on average 6% higher
than USDA HPLC plasma results. However, the rela-
tive difference varied with tHcy concentration (8% and
12% at the median and at the 13 mol/L cutoff value,
respectively). Because 97% of all predicted CDC HPLC
results were within 20% of the measured results, the
method adjustment equation appeared to correct for
this concentration-dependent difference (Table 1 and
Supplemental Fig. 1B in the online Data Supplement).
AxSYM results (n  361) were on average 1% higher
than CDC HPLC results; 99.7% of all predicted AxSYM
results were within 20% of the measured results (Table
1 and Supplemental Fig. 1C in the online Data Supple-
ment). Finally, AxSYM results (n  361) were on aver-
age 6% higher than IMx results, with a constant relative
difference across all concentrations; 99% of all pre-
dicted AxSYM results were within 20% of the measured
results (Table 1 and Supplemental Fig. 1D in the online
Data Supplement).

DISTRIBUTIONS OF PLASMA tHcy CONCENTRATIONS, 1991­2004
During 1991­1994, 7% of the entire population and
22% of older persons were classified as having CKD (all
stages). During the 3 postfortification survey periods,
8% (1999­2000), 9% (2001­2002), and 9% (2003­
2004) of the entire population and 27%, 29%, and
31%, respectively, of older persons were classified as
having CKD. Exclusion of persons with CKD had a
noticeable impact on the frequency distribution curves
(Fig. 1) and on the prevalence estimates of increased
plasma tHcy concentrations, especially for older per-
sons (approximately 10 percentage points lower prev-
alence estimates for increased tHcy concentrations).
Frequency distributions after excluding persons with
CKD from the entire population and from older per-
sons for each of the 4 survey periods illustrate how the
distribution in circulating tHcy concentrations
changed over time (Fig. 2). The width of the distribu-
tion curve narrowed from before to after fortification,
and the long upper tail disappeared almost entirely.
The distribution curves for 1999­2000 and 2001­2002
were almost entirely overlapping.
TRENDS IN PLASMA tHcy CONCENTRATIONS, 1991­2004
Because of the age  survey period and the sex  sur-
vey period interactions, we present median concentra-
tions of plasma tHcy and time trend analysis for age-
and sex-specific subgroups in the 4 survey periods (Ta-
ble 2). Except for adolescent women (P  0.0725), con-
centrations of plasma tHcy decreased significantly in
every sex-age subgroup after the introduction of folate
fortification in 1998 (0.2­1.2 mol/L based on medi-
ans, corresponding 3%­13% decreases). These pre- to
postfortification decreases were largest for older per-
sons: 1.0 mol/L (10%) for older men and 1.2 mol/L
(13%) for older women. When stratified further by
race-ethnicity, concentrations of plasma tHcy de-
creased significantly in most subgroups except for ad-
olescent NHW and MA women (P  0.1573 and P 
0.0626, respectively), older NHB men (P  0.0284),
and older NHB and MA women (P  0.0782 and P 
0.0763, respectively). We found similar decreases based
on geometric means as reported here for medians.
There were no significant changes in tHcy concentra-
tions across the 3 postfortification survey periods.
TRENDS IN PREVALENCE ESTIMATES OF INCREASED OR
DESIRABLE PLASMA tHcy CONCENTRATIONS, 1991­2004
Among the 3 age groups, the prevalence of increased
plasma tHcy concentrations (13 mol/L) was always
higher in older persons compared to the other 2 age
groups, both prefortification (approximately 20%­
30% in older persons vs approximately 10%­20% in
adults, and 10% in adolescents) and postfortification
(approximately 5%­15% in older persons vs approxi-
mately 3%­7% in adults, and 3% in adolescents)
(Table 3). Prevalence estimates of increased plasma
tHcy values decreased significantly in all subgroups
from before to after fortification, except for decreases
of borderline significance in adolescent women (P 
0.0431) and older NHB women (P  0.0178). Preva-
lence estimates did not change significantly across the 3
postfortification survey periods.
Among the 3 age groups, the prevalence of desir-
able plasma tHcy concentrations (9 mol/L) was al-
ways lower in older persons compared to the other 2
age groups, both prefortification (approximately 25%­
50% in older persons vs approximately 50%­75% in

(approximately 25%­70% in older persons vs approx-

(Table 3). Prevalence estimates of desirable plasma
tHcy values increased significantly from before to after
fortification in about 50% of the sex- and age-specific
subgroups but did not change for adolescent women
(P  0.0354), older men (P  0.3947), older NHW

women (P  0.3345). They also did not change signif-
icantly across the 3 postfortification survey periods, ex-
cept for an increase in adult women between 1999­
2000 and 2001­2002 and decreases in adult and older
women and older NHW women between 2001­2002
and 2003­2004.
SELECTED POPULATION PERCENTILE VALUES FOR PLASMA tHcy
CONCENTRATIONS FOR PRE- AND POSTFORTIFICATION
The 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles for the prefortifi-
cation survey (1991­1994) and the postfortification
time period (1999­2004) by sex, race-ethnicity, and
age group are shown in Table 4. The postfortification
downward shift in the 95th percentile in all subgroups
is readily apparent.
Discussion
Circulating tHcy concentrations have been measured
as part of the NHANES survey for 3 years before and 6
years after the introduction of folate fortification. Until
now, however, tHcy data could not be compared across
survey periods because of changes in analytical meth-
ods and specimen matrices. We derived method ad-
justment equations to allow for time trend analysis.
This process had several strengths: (a) sample sizes for
method comparisons were of sufficient size, except the
EDTA plasma-to-serum comparison; (b) all 3 method
comparisons spanned the reference interval of tHcy
concentrations; (c) each comparison was conducted
over a period of several days to capture the interrun
variability; (d) the small adjustment between the Ab-
bott IMx and AxSYM platforms was consistent with a

sion in tHcy values due to inconsistent sample

accommodates both differences in matrix and process-
ing time based on the comparison of USDA HPLC se-
rum to USDA HPLC plasma. However, our findings
that serum samples had approximately 10% higher
tHcy concentrations than optimally prepared plasma
samples correspond well with previous findings (37),
indicating that this source of bias was properly ad-
justed. Another limitation is the uncertainty generated
in the 3-stage adjustment on the prefortification data
to make it comparable to postfortification data. The
calculated propagated error for the 3-stage adjust-
ment, as computed from the r2, is 9%, small enough to
allow the detection of a decrease in tHcy concentra-
tions between pre- and postfortification. Because the 3
method regression conversions increase the impreci-
sion of the final estimated tHcy values for 1991­1994,
such imprecision would reduce the statistical power to
detect differences (toward the null) between the survey
periods.
Excluding persons with CKD was an important
step in limiting our data analysis to the healthy US
population. Otherwise, we would have overestimated
prevalence rates of increased tHcy in older persons by
approximately 10 percentage points, and we would
have confounded our time trend analysis because
the prevalence of CKD has increased in the older US
population during the past 13 years (22% in 1991­1994
and 31% in 2003­2004), possibly as a result of the in-
creasing prevalence of obesity and related type II dia-
betes. Although other conditions, genetic variations,
unfavorable lifestyles, and the consumption of dietary
supplements are known to affect tHcy values, we con-
sidered those factors to be part of the wide spectrum of
lifestyle choices to which the healthy US population is
exposed.
Jacques et al. reported a moderate decrease of
7% in tHcy concentrations in the Framingham popu-
lation (from 10.1­9.4 mol/L) for the time period
1995­1998, a finding that reflected the beginning of
the voluntary phase of folate fortification in the US
(12). After the introduction of folate fortification in
Chile, a 12% decrease in tHcy concentrations (from
13.0­11.4 mol/L) was observed in an elderly Chilean
population (15). The pre- (9­11 mol/L) and post-
fortification (8­10 mol/L) tHcy concentrations in
older persons in our analysis were similar to those
found in the Framingham population but lower than
those in Chile. The decrease from pre- to postforti-
fication tHcy concentrations in our analysis (10% in
older men and 13% in older women) was similar to

the decrease found in Chile but larger than that found
in the Framingham population, possibly because tHcy
concentrations may have decreased further after 1998.
Jacques et al. (12) reported changes in the preva-
lence of increased tHcy concentrations (13 mol/L)
from 19% (prefortification) to 10% (postfortification).
The changes in prevalence for older men (32% to 14%)

fication (10%) are similar to prevalence estimates in
the Framingham population (data not shown).
A decrease in tHcy concentrations as a result of
fortification was expected, particularly because serum
and erythrocyte folate concentrations increased signif-
icantly during this period (10­13, 38), and high tHcy
concentrations can be responsive to improvements in
folate status. Our results are in good agreement with a
metaanalysis of 25 randomized controlled trials (39).
The Homocysteine Lowering Trialists' Collaboration
assessed the effect of different doses of folic acid on
reduction of plasma tHcy concentrations in approxi-
mately 2500 inividuals and found that daily doses of
200 g are associated with 60% of the maximal re-
duction achieved with doses of 800 g. At a prefor-
tification tHcy concentration of 10 mol/L, as found
in our current analysis, and serum folate concentration
of 12 nmol/L, as shown in our last analysis (38), the
predicted reduction in plasma tHcy concentration was
12.6% at a dose of 200 g of folic acid/day. We found
reductions in tHcy concentrations of approximately
10%.
It remains to be seen whether lowering tHcy con-
centrations in the US population will have any effects
on primary and/or secondary prevention of cardiovas-
cular disease. Yang et al. reported recently on what
might be a first effect of fortification on stroke mortal-
ity: the ongoing decline in stroke mortality observed in
the US between 1990 and 1997 accelerated in 1998­
2002 in nearly all population strata (14). Similar effects
were seen in Canada, whereas the decline in stroke
mortality in England and Wales did not change signif-
icantly between 1990 and 2002 (14). Interestingly, a
recent metaanalysis of randomized trials assessing the
efficacy of folic acid supplementation in the prevention
of stroke found a significantly reduced risk of stroke of
18% (7). A greater beneficial effect was seen in trials
with treatment duration of more than 36 months; a
decrease in the concentration of tHcy of more than
20% was found in trials done in regions without grain
fortification and among individuals without a history
of stroke.
Although estimates of median tHcy concentra-
tions appeared to increase during the 3 postfortifica-
tion survey periods, the changes were too small to reach
statistical significance. Slight increases in tHcy concen-
trations during postfortification could be expected ow-
ing to moderate decreases in serum and erythrocyte
folate concentrations during the same time period
(38). It is unlikely that there were other significant
changes in lifestyle behaviors (e.g., diet, exercise, sup-
plement use) over such a short period of time. How-
ever, secular changes in lifestyle behaviors associated
with tHcy concentrations were not studied specifically

in our analysis. Furthermore, our results can be gener-
alized to the part of the US population that is free of
CKD, but not the overall US population.
We have presented a detailed analysis of circulat-
ing tHcy concentrations in the US population. Al-
though the complex method adjustment performed to
allow for time trend analysis generated some uncer-
tainty, this uncertainty was small enough to allow the
quantification of a modest decrease in plasma tHcy
concentrations from before to after fortification. The
decrease of approximately 10% corresponds well with
effects seen in intervention trials with folic acid and in
smaller observational studies. We saw no significant
changes in tHcy concentrations during the 6 postforti-
fication years. Stabilization of tHcy concentrations
may largely depend on the stabilization of blood folate
concentrations as well as on other possible causes of
increased concentrations, including but not limited to
vitamin B12
status. Therefore, monitoring of all related
biomarkers should continue, and further investiga-
tions of other possible causes of high tHcy concentra-
tions should be undertaken.
