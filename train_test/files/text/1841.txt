ABSTRACT
KRUGER, J., M. M. YORE, and H. W. KOHL III. Leisure-Time Physical Activity Patterns by Weight Control Status: 1999­2002
NHANES. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 39, No. 5, pp. 788­795, 2007. Introduction: Regular physical activity reduces the risk of
hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, and some cancers. Physical activity is associated inversely with
overweight and obesity prevalence, thus potentially assisting in weight control efforts. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to
examine the variability of physical activity levels and their patterns by self-reported weight control status in a nationally
representative sample. Methods: Four years of data from the 1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) were used to examine leisure-time physical activity patterns (regular, irregular, inactive) and the prevalence of weight
control practices (trying to lose, trying to maintain, not trying to lose or maintain) among U.S. adults (N = 9496). Results: The
prevalence of regular physical activity was 32.6% among people trying to lose weight, 37.9% among people trying to maintain weight,
and 21.8% among those not trying to lose or maintain weight. Those trying to lose weight were almost three times as likely to be
regularly active (vs inactive), and those trying to maintain weight were over three times more likely to be regularly active (vs inactive)
than those not trying to lose or maintain weight. The most commonly reported activities among those trying to lose weight were
walking (38.3%), yard work (14.5%), biking (12.5%), and running (11.6%). Conclusions: Despite the importance of physical activity,
fewer than half the people trying to lose or maintain weight were regularly active during leisure-time. People trying to lose or maintain
weight had a higher likelihood of being regularly active than those not trying to lose or maintain weight. Walking was the most
common type of physical activity among all weight control groups. Health promotion efforts should promote increased levels of
physical activity among all adults. Key Words: EXERCISE, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, HEALTH PROMOTION
Sedentary behavior is an important contributor to the
temporal increase in overweight and obesity (25), but
only 46% of U.S. adults engage in recommended
levels of physical activity associated with health benefits
(6). Reasons for lack of physical activity may be explained
by a constellation of individual and environmental factors
such as perceived lack of time, feeling too tired, obtaining
enough exercise at one`s job, no motivation to exercise (4),
lack of access to recreational facilities (11), and lack of
sidewalks (15). Although demographic correlates of physi-
cal activity in broad adult populations have been well
documented through research interventions (16,22,24),
national surveys (5,9), and community-based studies
(12,13), physical activity patterns specific to adults trying
to lose weight or maintain weight have not been well
documented.
Increasing physical activity is one of the cornerstones of
a long-term, healthy weight-management program (1).
Physical activity has been effective at helping people to
keep from gaining weight (25) and to lose weight when
combined with a decrease in caloric intake (27). Although
physical activity should be an integral part of weight
control practices, little is known on a population level
about the amount and type of physical activity reported
among people trying to control their weight. Understanding
patterns of physical activity behaviors among people trying
to lose weight or trying to maintain their weight may
provide health care professionals with direction as to how
to increase physical activity levels in the U.S. population
and among people engaging in weight control behaviors.

patterns in this population can also assist in eventually
reducing the prevalence of overweight and obesity.
Evidence for weight loss and weight loss practices as a
primary public health concern comes from several sources.
There has been an increase in the availability of weight
loss products and services, with Americans spending over
$46 billion dollars a year in this industry (17). However,
there are limited data on national estimates of weight loss
and weight maintenance practices. Previous data on the
prevalence of weight loss among adults have shown that
46.3% of adults were trying to lose weight in 2000 (3).
Survey data collected from the National Weight Control
Registry provide data on over 4000 individuals who have
been successful at long-term weight loss maintenance;
89% reported both diet and physical activity for weight
loss, but among this sample, only 1% reported using
exercise alone for weight loss (28). Despite these multiple
sources, information specific to physical activity patterns
among those who have lost weight or who are trying to
maintain their weight is rare. The purpose of this paper
is to compare and describe leisure-time physical activity
level by weight control status in a nationally representative
sample of U.S. adults.
METHODS
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a major program of the National Center for
Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion that assesses health and nutritional status of adults
and children in the United States (8). The NHANES is
unique in that it combines interviews and physical
examinations. Data are released on public-use data files
every 2 yr. In the current study, data from two cycles
(1999­2000 and 2001­2002) were combined to create
NHANES 1999­2002, to increase sample size and analytic
options. Data items collected in all combined years were
comparable in wording and methods; therefore, the data
were concatenated to form a single file (interview sample
size of 21,004). To develop an adult analytic sample, we
eliminated the following respondents: age G 18 (N = 9563),
missing information on physical activity types (N = 17),
missing body mass index (N = 1297), pregnant women
(N = 613), and respondents who did not answer the
questions about trying to lose weight or not trying to
gain weight (N = 18). The final analytic sample was N =
9496. In 1999­2000, the overall response rate for those
interviewed was 81.9% (9965 out of 12,160), and the
response rate for those examined was 76.3% (9282 out of
12,160). In 2001­2002, the overall response rate for those
interviewed was 83.9% (11,039 out of 13,156), and the
response rate for those examined was 79.6% (10,477 out of
13,156).
We created three mutually exclusive categories of
weight control (weight loss and management) status: those
trying to lose weight, those trying to maintain weight, and
those not trying to lose or maintain weight. In the
NHANES interview, respondents were first asked their
current self-reported weight and their weight 1 yr ago; if
they had lost weight, they were asked whether it had been
intentional (8). To assess current weight loss, respondents
were then asked, ``During the past 12 months, have you
tried to lose weight?'' Those who self-reported an inten-
tional weight loss of 10 lb or more or who reported that
they were currently trying to lose weight were categorized
as trying to lose weight. Those who did not self-report a
weight loss of 10 lb or more were asked the following
question to assess weight maintenance status (i.e., attempt
to control weight and prevent from gaining weight):
``During the past 12 months, have you done anything to
keep from gaining weight?'' Those who indicated having
tried to keep from gaining weight in the past 12 months
and who were not trying to lose weight were categorized as
trying to maintain their weight. If respondents said ``no'' to
both questions, they were classified as not trying to lose or
maintain weight.
Physical activity questions from the 1999­2002
NHANES queried participation in leisure-time activities,
including exercise, sports, and physically active hobbies,
during the past 30 d (6). Types of specific leisure-time
physical activity were assessed by asking respondents six
separate questions about their participation in specific
vigorous- and moderate-intensity activities for at least 10
min per occasion during the past 30 d. Respondents were
asked ``Over the past 30 d, did you do any vigorous
activities for at least 10 min that caused heavy sweating, or
large increases in breathing or heart rate? Some examples
are running, lap swimming, aerobics classes, or fast
bicycling.'' Respondents were handed a card with a list of
24 vigorous activities and an ``other'' category. Those who
reported ``yes'' were asked, ``[Over the past 30 d] what
vigorous activities did you do?'' They were then asked the
frequency (e.g., how many times per day, per week, or per
month) and duration (e.g., how long in terms of minutes or
hours) they had performed these activities. In a similar
manner, respondents were also asked about their partici-
pation in moderate-intensity physical activity: ``[Over the
past 30 d], did you do moderate activities for at least 10
min that caused only light sweating or a slight to moderate
increase in breathing or heart rate? Some examples are
brisk walking, bicycling for pleasure, golf, or dancing.''
Individuals who reported that they had engaged in
moderate-intensity activity were asked to report the
frequency and duration of any of the 32 moderate
activities. Activities reported for G 10 min and those
reported for Q 12 hIdj1 were not included in the NHANES
dataset.
The total time for participation in either moderate- or
vigorous-intensity leisure-time physical activities in the
past 30 d was summed to characterize three activity
patterns. Respondents were grouped as regularly active if
they reported engaging in a total of Q 600 min, Q 20 times

in the last month, of a combination of moderate- or
vigorous-intensity activity. These estimates approximate
Q 150 minIwkj1 of moderate- to vigorous-intensity
physical activity. Those active at a lower frequency or
duration were considered irregularly active, and those who
reported no moderate- or vigorous-intensity leisure-time
activity in the last month were considered inactive.
Activities that were similar conceptually were grouped
together--for example vigorous-intensity running and
jogging and moderate-intensity yard work and gardening.
The median time spent in moderate leisure-time activity in
the past month was calculated among those who had
participated in any physical activity. To examine the
physical activity further, we created two subsets of regular
physical activity, a higher and a lower activity profile. The
higher­activity level physical activity category consisted of
respondents reporting Q 1800 min, Q 30 times, of total
physical activity (moderate- or vigorous-intensity) in the
last month; this is equivalent to 60 min of physical activity
on most days of the week. The lower­activity level
physical activity category consisted of respondents report-
ing Q 600 minIwkj1, Q 20 times (but less than high
activity) in the last month; this is equivalent to 30 min of
physical activity on most days of the week. The estimate of
30 min on most days of the week is based on the physical
activity recommendation for health benefits established by
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 (26), and the
estimate of 60 min on most days of the week is based on
the weight maintenance recommendation.
Height and weight were measured in each of the three
NHANES mobile examination centers. BMI was calculated
by dividing weight (kg) by squared height (m2). Four BMI
categories were created: normal weight (BMI G 25),
overweight (BMI = 25­29.9), obese class I (BMI = 30­
34.9), and obese class II (BMI Q 35). Three categories of
BMI were used for analyses (normal weight, overweight,
obese) because of small sample sizes in the obese class II
category. Compared with those whose BMI values were
not missing, those whose BMI values were missing were more
likely to be female (55.4%, P = 0.02), to be older than 65 yr
(32.8%, P G 0.01), to have less than a high school education
(29.6%, P G 0.01), to be non-Hispanic white (71.3%, P G
0.01), to not be doing anything about their weight (56.0%,
P G 0.01), and to be inactive (54.2%, P G 0.01).
Data were age standardized to the 2000 U.S. Census
(18­29 yr, 30­44 yr, 45­64 yr, Q 65 yr). Sample weights
were used to adjust for unequal selection probabilities,
nonresponse, and adjustments to independent population
controls (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_
03_04/nhanes_analytic_guidelines_dec_2005.pdf). Stand-
ard errors were estimated using Taylor series linearization.
Prevalences were calculated to describe the sample
characteristics (gender, age, race/ethnicity, education,
BMI, physical activity level) and the prevalence of specific

types of physical activities among each weight control
status (those trying to lose weight, those trying to maintain
weight, and those not trying lose or maintain weight).
Chi-square was calculated to determine prevalence differences
between physical activity levels (e.g., inactive, irregularly
active, and regularly active), and differences were consid-
ered significant at P G 0.05. Polytomous regression was
used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CI) of the association between physical
activity level (inactive was the referent group; thus,
regularly active was compared with inactive, and irregu-
larly active was compared with inactive) and weight
control status (not trying to lose or maintain weight was
the referent group). Gender, age, race/ethnicity, education,
and BMI were included as covariates in the model. To
describe the distribution of respondents who were catego-
rized as regularly active at recommended levels, we
created a low- and a high-activity group. All analyses
were conducted using SUDAAN (windows version 9.0;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC)
software package to account for the complex sampling
design.
RESULTS
In 1999­2002, 45.6% of NHANES participants reported
trying to lose weight; 40.2% were men and 59.8% were
women (Table 1). Among people trying to lose weight,
71.7% were white, 55.3% had more than a high school
education, and 17.6% had BMI Q 35. In contrast, 9.5%
reported trying to maintain weight, among whom 48.3%
were women, 82.5% white, 67.9% had more than a high
school education, and 10.2% had BMI Q 35.
Table 2 shows the percentages of physical activity
levels across selected demographic and weight control
characteristics; 37.4% of respondents were inactive, 34.3%
were irregularly active, and 28.3% were regularly active.
We also found that men (29.7%) had a higher prevalence
of regular activity than women (26.9%; P G 0.001). Among
those ages 18­29 yr, the prevalence of being regularly
active (34.1%) was significantly higher than for those older
than 65 yr (24.0%; P G 0.001). Regular activity was also
significantly higher among those with more than a high
school education (35.4%) than among those with less than
a high school education (16.0%; P G 0.001). Approxi-
mately 32.6% of those trying to lose weight and 37.9% of
those trying to maintain weight were regularly active,
compared with 21.8% of those not trying to lose or to
maintain weight (P G 0.001).
Compared with those not trying to control their weight,
those trying to lose weight were almost three times more
likely to be regularly active (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 2.3­3.3)
than inactive and almost two times more likely to be
irregularly active (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.5­2.1) than
inactive (Table 3). Respondents who were trying to

maintain weight, compared with those not trying to control
weight, were over three times more likely to be regularly
active (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.5­4.3) than inactive and over
two times more likely to be irregularly active (OR = 2.3,
95% CI = 1.6­3.4) than inactive.
Walking was the most common activity reported across
all weight control categories, although the prevalence of
walking was greater among those trying to maintain weight
(45.3%) compared with those trying to lose (38.3%) or
those not trying to lose or maintain weight (24.0%)
(Table 4). Common physical activities reported by those
trying to control their weight were yard work, biking,
running, and weight lifting.
Using data from the 1999­2002 NHANES, the median
minutes of physical activity in the past month within each
weight loss group, stratified by activity level, did not differ
significantly (Table 5). Among those who were regularly
active, the median minutes of those trying to lose weight
were lower than for those not trying to lose or maintain
weight (1692 vs 1794). Similarly, among those who were
irregularly active, the median minutes of those trying to
lose weight were lower than for those not trying to lose or
maintain weight (385 vs 401).
As shown in Figure 1, approximately 18% of individuals
who reported trying to lose weight and 23% of those trying to
maintain weight met the minimum Dietary Guidelines (26)
recommendation (i.e., 30 min) designed for health benefits.
Fewer than 15% of those trying to maintain weight reported
engaging in physical activity at the recommended level for
weight maintenance (i.e., 60 min). When examining the
differences in meeting the minimum guidelines, those trying
to lose weight or maintain weight were significantly different
fromthose whowerenot tryingtolose ormaintainweight(P G
0.001). Statistical differences in meeting the higher activity
profile were also noted between those trying to lose or
maintain weight compared with those not trying to lose or
maintain weight (P G 0.001).
DISCUSSION
Approximately 32.6% of the U.S. adult population in
1999­2002 who were trying to lose weight engaged in
regular physical activity. Our findings regarding those who
were trying to lose weight are similar to the weight loss
practices reported in the 1989 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System, which found that 36.4% of men and
38.8% of women who were trying to lose weight met
regular activity patterns (at least three times per week for at
least 20 min per session, at less than 60% cardiorespiratory
capacity) (9). Although physical activity participation rates
are low, people trying to lose weight or maintain weight
were more likely to engage in regular physical activity than

people who reported not doing anything to lose or maintain
weight. It is possible that people trying to lose weight or to
maintain their current weight are more health conscious
and seek information and advice from health care providers
to assist them in weight loss or maintenance (20). It is also
interesting that a substantial proportion of individuals who
were overweight or obese were not trying to lose or
maintain weight. Further research is needed to determine
whether body weight acceptance among chronic dieters
increases weight control attempts (2).
From this national survey, we found that 37.9% of those
trying to maintain weight reported regular physical
activity. Regardless of weight control status, physical
activity is important for the improvement and maintenance
of health. Although the present study did not investigate
the effects of accompanying weight control strategies (e.g.,
diet practices), this research adds insight into physical
activity patterns by weight control subgroups. Because
weight control is a complex behavior, for long-term weight
loss and maintenance, the American College of Sports
Medicine (1) recommends that overweight and obese
individuals progressively increase the amount of time they
spend being physical active.
To fully understand weight control status, we looked at a
model that included a four-category measure of weight
loss: those trying to lose weight with BMI G 25.0, those
trying to lose weight with BMI Q 25.0, those trying to
maintain weight, and those not trying to lose or maintain
weight. Using this four-category model, the odds of being
regularly active among those trying to lose weight with
BMI G 25.0 were 2.5 (95% CI = 1.9­3.3) and were 2.9
(95% CI = 2.3­3.7) among those trying to lose weight with
BMI Q 25.0, compared with those not trying to lose or
maintain weight (data not shown). Because there was no
significant difference between the two BMI categories, we
decided to keep those trying to lose weight as one group.
We also examined demographic characteristics of those
with BMI G 25.0: 39.8% were male, 36.9% were ages 18­
29, 48.1% were white (data not shown). Because more than
one quarter of those with normal BMI were trying to lose
weight, these findings suggest that it may be important to
examine cultural perceptions of inappropriate weight loss.
Those trying to lose weight with BMI G 25.0 may be trying
to lose weight for cosmetic reasons (21), because their BMI
is within normal weight guidelines.
These findings suggest that health-promotion efforts
should encourage increased levels of physical activity
among all adults. Physical activity prevalence tended to
be higher among men than women and to be higher among
18- to 29-yr-olds than among other age groups. The
prevalence of regular physical activity was lowest among
those age 65 yr and older. These findings are consistent
with those from other national surveys (10,23) that have
provided demographic correlates of people who engage in
weight control practices.
A significant association between weight control status and
being regularly active (vs inactive) and irregularly active (vs
inactive) was found. Compared with those not trying to lose
or maintain weight, those trying to maintain their weight had
slightly higher odds of regular physical activity (OR = 3.3)
than those trying to lose weight (OR = 2.7). We compared
models with and without BMI to examine the impact of BMI
on physical activity, and the model that included BMI was a
better fit, so we decided to leave BMI in the model. Although
we were not able to determine why activity pattern differ-
ences exist, those trying to maintain their weight may be
incorporating physical activity into their daily life in a
different manner from those trying to lose weight. Perhaps
maintainers have had previous experience with weight loss
and recognize the importance of physical activity in keeping
weight off. It is also possible that those trying to lose weight
are engaging in caloric-restriction practices only, without
integrating physical activity (18).
We found that walking was the most prevalent physical
activity; approximately one in three adults who were trying
to lose or maintain weight walked in their leisure time. The
FIGURE 1--Prevalence of levels of physical activity among adults
who are regularly active by weight control status: NHANES 1999­
2002. Respondents were asked to report the respective total minutes of
leisure-time activity in the last month. For those who were regularly
active, the total minutes of moderate and vigorous physical activity in
the previous 30 d were subset into lower activity (Q 600 minIwkj1, Q 20
times per month, but less than high activity; equivalent to 30 min on
most days of the week) and higher activity (Q 1800 minIwkj1, Q 30
times per month; equivalent to 60 min on most days of the week).

prevalence of walking among those trying to lose or
maintain weight was similar to the overall national
estimates reported from the 1998 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (38.6%) (19). Because walking was
the most prevalent physical activity, this finding provides
direction for health-promotion campaigns to promote the
most popular activity--walking--to increase the number
of adults who engage regularly, preferably daily, in mod-
erate physical activity for Q 30 minIdj1. In this study, we
examined physical activity patterns among people trying to
lose or maintain weight during their leisure time; future
studies could examine opportunities for increased physical
activity in nonleisure contexts (i.e., occupation, trans-
portation, and household).
The median minutes of activity reported by each weight
control group within a physical activity level were com-
parable. Increased doses of physical activity can assist in
improving overall health. Future research could focus on
overall volume by types of activity and could include
questions on walking, active transportation, and household
activities.
Examination of physical activity by weight control status
suggests significantly different patterns. Among those
trying to maintain weight, a higher proportion reported
being regularly active at the lower activity level (i.e., 30
min) than at the higher activity level (i.e., 60 min). Because
fewer than 15% of those trying to maintain their weight
met the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 physical
activity recommendation for weight maintenance (26)
health care professionals are encouraged to emphasize
physical activity guidelines specific to maximize health
and to maintain a healthy weight. Future research needs to
determine whether people do not meet recommendations
because of a lack of knowledge of the recommendations or
because of a lack of understanding of how to accumulate
recommended amounts of activity. The Task Force on
Community Preventive Services of the U.S. Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (7) has suggested that
environmental, economic, and social support barriers
influence exercise behavior. To overcome barriers to
physical activity, those trying to control their weight are
encouraged to seek opportunities for physical activity near
where they live, such as public open spaces and parks.
Increasing convenient opportunities to engage in lifestyle
physical activity (i.e., access to parks and trails) may
increase enjoyment and promote lifelong participation in
physical activity. Prior research findings suggest that the
presence of trails and access to places for physical activity
may increase the proportion of people meeting the
recommended amounts of leisure-time activity (14).
Our findings have some limitations to consider because
the data are cross-sectional. First, weight history and
physical activity status are collected via self-report.
Second, the questions used on the NHANES have not been
validated to date. Although it is difficult to validate weight
control status, similar physical activity questions were used
in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance system and
have been shown to be reliable and valid (21,29). From the
findings of this paper, we cannot infer the extent to which
weight loss history influences physical activity patterns or
weight control status. Third, the questions on weight
control and physical activity might prompt a socially
desirable answer and overestimate the prevalence of weight
loss or weight maintenance attempts or physical activities.
Fourth, the focus of this paper was on leisure-time physical
activity, and only sports, aerobic, and anaerobic activities
during leisure time were included in our analysis. It is
unclear whether the distribution of physical activity
patterns would be different if alternative domains such as
transportation and household activities were included.
Fifth, there may be bias because of the time frame
specified in the questionnaire. The questions on weight
control status referred to behavior during the past 12
months, and the questions on physical activity referred to
behavior during the past 30 d. Therefore, we do not know
how long respondents had engaged in their current physical
activity pattern during the last 12 months. Sixth, there were
unfortunately not enough people in the sample to examine
race/ethnicity differences among those trying to lose
weight, trying to maintain weight, or not trying to lose or
maintain weight to make any truly meaningful interpreta-
tion of minority weight control behavior.
Efforts are needed to increase the awareness of physical
activity recommendations among people who are trying to
control their weight, because approximately 60% are not
regularly active. To understand the relationship between
physical activity behavior and weight control status, future
studies need to examine racial/ethnic differences in con-
junction with other social class indicators. To increase
physical activity level in the population, further research on
the complex relationship between the political, social, and
environmental factors and physical activity is needed to
guide interventions. Findings from this paper are useful for
tracking physical activity patterns and creating messages to
encourage various types of physical activities among all
those trying to control their weight. For many people starting
an activity program, walking is a form of moderate-intensity
physical activity that is relatively easy to engage in regularly.
On the basis of these findings, roughly only 40% of
adults trying to lose or maintain weight engaged in regular
physical activity. Regardless of weight control attempt
status, the most common type of physical activity was
walking. Given the acceptability of walking among people
trying to lose or maintain weight, all population subgroups
should be encouraged to walk. People trying to lose weight
or to keep from gaining weight should minimally try to
meet the physical activity recommendation for overall
health of at least 30 min of moderate-intensity physical
activity on most days of the week.
