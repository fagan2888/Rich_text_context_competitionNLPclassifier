ABSTRACT. Objective. To examine the prevalence of
overweight among US preschool children 2 months
through 5 years of age between the years 1971 through
1974 and 1988 through 1994.
Design. Nationally representative cross-sectional sur-
veys with a physical examination, including measure-
ment of stature, length, and weight. Between 1200 and
7500 children younger than 6 years were examined in
each of four different surveys during 1971 through 1974
(first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
[NHANES I]), 1976 through 1980 (NHANES II), 1982
through 1984 (Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey), and 1988 through 1994 (NHANES III).
Results. The prevalence of overweight increased
among some sex and age groups of preschool children
between 1971 through 1974 and 1988 through 1994. More
than 10% of 4- and 5-year-old girls were overweight in
1988 through 1994 compared with 5.8% in 1971 through
1974. However, there was no change during this period in
the prevalence of overweight among 1- and 2- to 3-year-
old children. During 1988 through 1994, the prevalence of
overweight among children 2 months through 5 years of
age was consistently higher in girls than boys. Mexican-
American children had a higher prevalence of over-
weight than non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white
children. These results parallel what has been reported
for older children and adults in the United States.
Conclusion. These results show that in the last 20
years the prevalence of overweight has increased among
4- and 5-year-old children but not among younger chil-
dren. These findings suggest that efforts to prevent over-
weight, including encouragement of physical activity
and improved diets, should begin in early childhood.

Overweight among preschool children is a con-
cern, because it may have long-term health conse-
quences.1 Excess body weight in childhood is associ-
ated with overweight in adulthood,2,3 and excess
body fat, or obesity, is recognized as a health risk for
adults.4 Obesity and overweight in childhood also
have been linked to subsequent morbidity and mor-
tality in adulthood.5,6 Moreover, overweight pre-
schoolers have been shown to have higher mean
levels of cholesterol than other children.7 The con-
cern about overweight prevalence in preschoolers is
heightened by recent increases in overweight among
school-aged children and adults. Overweight preva-
lence increased among boys and girls 6 through 11
years of age from approximately 5% in 1963 through
1965 to 11% in 1988 through 1991 and 5% to 13%
among 12- through 17-year-old-boys.8 Furthermore,
at least one third of adults in the United States are
overweight.9
This article presents cross-sectional estimates of
overweight prevalence for preschool children be-
tween 2 months and 6 years of age in the United
States using weight adjusted for length or stature.
Current estimates are from the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
conducted during 1988 through 1994. In addition,
trends in overweight are presented based on esti-
mates from earlier NHANES.
METHODS
NHANES III is a nationally representative sample of the total
civilian noninstitutionalized population in the 50 states and the
District of Columbia. NHANES III collected information on indi-
viduals 2 months of age and older. The design was a stratified,
multistage probability sample based on selection of counties, city
or suburban blocks, households, and persons within households.
In total, approximately 40 000 people were selected, 31 311 of
whom received physical examinations. NHANES III was designed
to sample large numbers of preschool children to facilitate revis-
ing the original10 National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and
modified11 NCHS/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) growth charts for children. Mexican-American persons,
black persons, and persons older than 60 years were also over-
sampled to have large enough sample sizes for subgroup compar-
isons. Sample weights were used to adjust estimates back to the
appropriate population distribution.12,13
The NHANES comprise a series of cross-sectional, nationally
representative examination surveys conducted by the NCHS of
the CDC. NHANES III is the seventh in the series, which began in
1960. NHANES I, conducted from 1971 through 1974, was the first
survey to include preschool-aged children.14 NHANES II was
conducted from 1976 through 1980.15 A special study of Hispanic
populations, the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (HHANES), in three regions of the United States was con-
ducted from 1982 through 1984. The Mexican-American subpopu-

lation sampled in the HHANES was located entirely in the
southwestern United States.16
The surveys included both a home interview and a standard-
ized physical examination conducted in a mobile examination
center. A physical examination in the home was available for
infants 2 through 11 months of age. The physical examination
included measurement of recumbent length, stature, and weight.
In NHANES III recumbent length was measured in children
younger than 4 years, and stature was measured in children 2
years and older. Children wore paper examination gowns, and
infants wore only diapers.
The sample of NHANES III included 8765 children 2 months
through 5 years of age. Of these 8765 children, 8261 (94%) were
interviewed by proxy after informed consent was obtained from
parents or guardians. Of the 8261 for whom interview data were
obtained, 7784 (94%) were examined. The overall survey response
rate was 89% (7784 of 8765). Of the 7784 children participating in
NHANES III, 199 were excluded from this analysis because their
length or stature was above or below the range of the original
NCHS growth charts (67 children) or they were missing stature,
length, or weight data (132 children). Between initial household
screening and the physical examination, 65 children reached 6
years of age, and 4 home-examined children reached 1 year of age
before being examined and were excluded from these analyses.
Another 36 children had stature and length data that differed by 5
cm or more and were also excluded. The analytic data set included
7480 children 2 months through 5 years of age at the time of
examination.
The response rate is similar across the NHANES surveys and is
comparable or higher than other national health and nutrition
surveys.17 Trend estimates would not be affected by nonresponse,
because the nonresponders would have had to be different in each
survey. Nonresponse bias in NHANES III has been evaluated
elsewhere.18­20
Current overweight prevalence from NHANES III was esti-
mated by age at examination, sex, and race/ethnicity. Race/eth-
nicity were reported by household members. Children were cat-
egorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-
American, or other. Numbers for racial and ethnic groups in the
other category were too small for meaningful analysis when con-
sidered separately, but these persons were included in totals.
Trend estimates based on all the surveys were estimated by age,
sex, and race. Trend estimates were not estimated by race/ethnic-
ity, because Hispanic children cannot be separately identified in
NHANES I. However, estimates were made for Mexican-Ameri-
can children in the HHANES and NHANES III.
Overweight Definition
The definition of overweight among preschoolers is based on
the original NCHS weight-for-stature and weight-for-length ref-
erence growth curves.10 In this analysis, weight-for-length curves
were used for children 2 years and younger, and weight-for-
stature curves were used for children 2 through 5 years. Two-year-
old children were compared with either curve depending on
whether they had stature or length measures. Some 2-year-old
children in this sample had both measures and were included in
the prevalence estimates based on both weight-for-length and
weight-for-stature.
The prevalence of overweight is defined as the percentage of
children whose weight-for-stature or weight-for-length was above
the 95th percentile of the respective growth curve. Concern about
overweight prevalence occurs when prevalence exceeds 5%. This
definition of overweight is commonly used and recommended for
preschoolers.21,22
The 95th percentile is a conservative definition of overweight.
Infants and preschoolers are in a dynamic state of growth in which
body size is continually in a state of flux. For this reason, it is
difficult to assign a single cutoff value to an age range.23 To
circumvent potential adverse effects of clinically misclassifying
youths as overweight, using the highest cutoff of the 95th percen-
tile is prudent for children younger than 6 years. Among adults,
85th percentile cutoffs are often used24 and usually are based on
body mass index (BMI, kilograms per square meter). At this level
in adults, unfavorable health outcomes begin to emerge.25 The
Committee on Clinical Guidelines for Overweight in Adolescent
Preventive Services recommended the use of the 95th percentile of
BMI to classify adolescents as overweight.26
The prevalence of overweight clearly depends on the selection
of the reference population and the overweight criteria. The orig-
inal NCHS and modified NCHS/CDC growth charts include sev-
eral different data sources. For preschool children 3 to 6 years of
age the weight-for-height charts were based on weight and stature
data from the nationally representative NHANES I. For children
from birth to 3 years, the weight-for-height charts were based on
weight and recumbent length data from the Fels Research Institute
(for the years 1929 through 1974). The Fels data were for primarily
white, middle-class children. The original NCHS and NCHS/CDC
charts represent smoothed versions of the data from the various
surveys. Consequently, the prevalence estimates for children 3 to
6 years of age in NHANES I are not the expected 5%. Although
there is concern27,28 regarding the use of the original NCHS or
NCHS/CDC growth charts, the choice of the reference will not
affect trend estimates of overweight.
A disjunction in the growth curves occurs at 2 years of age29
because of the two different measures (stature and length) and
because of the different data sources used to make the charts. It
has been suggested that the disjunction between infant and later
curves occurs because the Fels sample was "actually taller or
measured taller than the US sample."27 For these and other rea-
sons, the original NCHS and modified NCHS/CDC growth charts
are currently under revision.28
Because of rapid growth in children younger than 2 years, there
is no agreed on definition of overweight in this age group. Con-
sequently, the term overweight is used for children 2 through 5
years of age when compared with the weight-for-stature growth
charts. When children are compared with the weight-for-length
growth charts, the percentage above the 95th percentile of the
weight-for-length growth curve is presented.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS30 and SUDAAN31 software pro-
grams. All analyses included sample weights that account for the
unequal probabilities of selection attributable to oversampling and
nonresponse (based on participation in the examination compo-
nent of the survey). Standard errors (SE) were calculated with
SUDAAN to account for the sample weights and complex sample
design. Tests of significant differences in prevalence estimates
within NHANES III by sex, age, and race/ethnicity were done
using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Trends in over-
weight prevalence among surveys were modeled and tested using
weighted least squares models for categorical data.32

months for each of the surveys. NHANES III over-
sampled preschool-aged children and, therefore, has
the largest sample sizes.
The percentage of children younger than 1 and 1 to
2 years who exceeded the 95th percentile on the
weight-for-length growth curves is presented in Ta-
ble 2 overall and by age, sex, and racial/ethnic
group. More than 5% of children younger than 1 and
1 to 2 years by sex and race/ethnicity were above the
95th percentile of weight-for-length. Among 1- to
2-year-old children, the percentage above the 95th
percentile on the weight-for-length growth curves
was 9.4%. It is unclear whether this relatively high
percentage is a reflection of a problem in the popu-
lation or an artifact of the growth charts for this age
group.29
There was no difference in the percentage above
the 95th percentile of the weight-for-length growth
curve between the younger than 1-year age group
and the 1- to 2-year age group. However, within age
groups there were significant differences by gender
and race/ethnicity. The percentage above the 95th
percentile of weight-for-length was significantly
higher among girls than boys (P  .01) after account-
ing for differences by age group and race/ethnicity
in a multivariate logistic regression model. The per-
centage above the 95th percentile was highest among
Mexican-American children, intermediate among
non-Hispanic black children, and lowest in non-His-
panic white children. The differences in the percent-
age above the 95th percentile between non-Hispanic
white and non-Hispanic black children (P  .05) and
between non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American
children were statistically significant (P  .01).
The prevalence of overweight among children 2 to
3 and 4 to 5 years of age based on weight-for-stature
is presented in Table 3. In general, the prevalence of
overweight was higher among children 4 to 5 years
of age than among children 2 to 3 years of age. In
both age groups, the prevalence of overweight was
lowest among non-Hispanic white boys. The preva-
lence of overweight among girls was higher than
among boys for all racial/ethnic and age groups.
More than 10% of all girls 4 to 5 years of age were
overweight. Among the three different racial/ethnic
groups, Mexican-American children had the highest
prevalence of overweight (12.0% for boys and 13.2%
for girls); non-Hispanic black children had interme-
diate prevalence, and non-Hispanic white children
had the lowest prevalence of overweight. Differences
by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity were statisti-
cally significant (P  .05) in multivariate logistic
regression models. For children 2 to 3 years of age,
prevalence estimates for most subgroups were near
or less than 5%. There was one notable exception in
which 10.5% of Mexican-American girls were over-
weight.
The effect of the disjunction29 in the growth charts
is evident in the NHANES III results. The percentage
of 1- to 2-year-old children above the 95th percentile
on the weight-for-length growth curve (Table 2) was
9.4%, whereas only 3.4% of the 2- to 3-year-old age
group was overweight based on weight-for-stature
(Table 3). Although data are not shown, the preva-
lence of overweight among 2-year-old children based
on weight-for-stature was substantially lower than
the prevalence among the same children based on
weight-for-length.
Trends Across National Surveys
Table 4 contains estimates of the percentage of
children overall and separately by race above the
95th percentile of weight-for-length for NHANES I
through III and for Mexican-American children in
the HHANES and NHANES III. Among children
younger than 24 months, estimates based on weight-
for-length showed an increase over time in the percent-
age of children above the 95th percentile. This change
was greater for girls than boys. In the youngest age
group (younger than 1 year) the percentage above the
95th percentile rose from 6.2% in NHANES II to 10.8%
in NHANES III. Among girls 12 to 23 months of age,
the percentage above the 95th percentile increased from
6.1% to 9.5% between NHANES I and NHANES III.
Among black girls 12 to 23 months of age, the percent-
age above the 95th percentile of weight-for-length rose
from 8.9% to 15.2%. There was no change in the per-
centage above the 95th percentile among boys 12 to 23
months of age.
Trends in national estimates of overweight preva-
lence based on weight-for-stature are presented in
Table 5. Among 2- to 3-year-old girls and boys there
was no significant change in the prevalence of over-
weight between 1971 through 1974 and 1988 through

1994. However, among 4- to 5-year-old children
there was an increase, especially in girls overall and
by race. From NHANES I to NHANES III the prev-
alence among 4- to 5-year-old girls rose from 5.8% to
10.8%. The prevalence of overweight among 4- to
5-year-old girls in NHANES III was statistically dif-
ferent from the prevalence of overweight in the other
two surveys (P  .01). Among black girls the prev-
alence more than doubled from 5.0% to 12.6% be-
tween 1971 through 1974 and 1988 through 1994.
Among black boys the prevalence of overweight in-
creased from 3.0% to 8.7% between 1976 through
1980 and 1988 through 1994. Statistical tests were not
performed on changes in overweight prevalence for
individual racial/ethnic groups.
The prevalence of overweight based on weight-
for-stature also has increased among most groups
of Mexican-American preschool children. Among
2-to 3-year-old Mexican-American girls the preva-
lence increased from 4.2% to 10.5%. Among Mex-
ican-American 4- to 5-year-old boys the prevalence
increased from 4.9% in the HHANES to 12.0% in
NHANES III.
DISCUSSION
These results are the most recent nationally repre-
sentative prevalence estimates of overweight among
preschool children in the United States. We found
that during the past two decades in the United States,
there was no change in the prevalence of overweight
among 2- to 3-year-old children, but there was an
increase among 4- to 5-year-old children, especially
in girls. Currently 10.8% of 4- to 5-year-old girls are
overweight. In addition, these data show that the
prevalence of overweight among preschool children
is higher among girls than boys and that overweight
prevalence is highest among Mexican-American chil-
dren. All of these results parallel what has been seen
among older children and adults in the same sur-
veys.8,9 These findings are based on highly reliable,
standardized measures of weight, stature, and length
across a series of national surveys.33,34
The higher prevalence of overweight among girls
than boys may be attributable to gender differences
in behavior and is unlikely to be an artifact of the
growth charts. In at least one study preschool boys
were found to be more physically active than pre-
school girls,35 and similar gender differences in over-

be done with caution, particularly among children
younger than 2 years. The charts for this age group
are based exclusively on white, middle-class chil-
dren, and there is some evidence that growth differ-
ences do exist between these ethnic groups. How-
ever, the use of the NCHS growth charts does
provide a uniform basis for estimating prevalence in
different populations, and measurements taken from
privileged children in developing countries in Africa,
Latin America, and the Caribbean do not differ sig-
nificantly from the NCHS reference population.38­42
The high prevalence of overweight found among
Mexican-American preschool children may have an
environmental basis. Trend estimates within racial/
ethnic groups indicate an increase in overweight be-
tween the HHANES and NHANES III for Mexican-
American children, strongly suggesting that environ-
mental influences are affecting the observed increase
in overweight. Furthermore, findings from the CDC
Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System indicate that
low-income Hispanic children 2 to 4 years of age in
the United States showed a relative increase in over-
weight prevalence of nearly 20% between 1980 and
1991.21
The difference in overweight prevalence between
the white and non-Hispanic white children in
NHANES III may reflect demographic changes in the
population of the United States. The prevalence of
overweight among preschool-aged children is higher
in the Mexican-American population, and this pop-
ulation makes up a greater percentage of the popu-
lation than it did in the early 1970s (4% in 1972 and
8% of children younger than 5 years in 1991).43,44 The
total population estimates may reflect this change.
Other researchers have also found a higher than
expected prevalence of overweight among preschool
children. A cross-sectional study of urban kinder-
gartners found excess overweight in 4- to 5-year-old
children.37 In this study, the prevalence of over-
weight was highest among Hispanic children, but
the overall growth of children was on par with the
NCHS/CDC reference curve. In addition, among
low-income preschool children, overweight has been
found to be highest in Hispanic children compared
with white, black, and Asian children.45,46 The prev-
alence of overweight among American Indian pre-
school children has also been shown to be in excess
of 5% and increasing over time. Using data from the
CDC Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System, the
prevalence of overweight among American Indian
preschoolers 2 to 4 years of age was estimated at
9.0% in 198847 and 11.9% in 1991.21
The reasons for the increase in the prevalence of
overweight among 4- to 5-year-old children are com-
plex. Excess weight gain is ultimately a function of
energy intake exceeding energy expenditure, with
sociocultural factors influencing lifestyle and diet
choices. However, the influence of bottle feeding,
early introduction of solid foods, balanced food se-
lection, and other dietary practices on overweight in
preschool-aged children is less clear. Dietary intake
data from the NHANESs suggest that mean energy
and fat intakes among preschoolers have not in-
creased in the last 20 years.17 A review of the litera-
ture suggests that overweight among preschool chil-
dren, as well as older children, may be associated
less with increased energy intake and more with low
physical activity.48 In the Framingham Children's
Study, inactive preschool children gained substan-
tially more subcutaneous fat by the time they
reached first grade than did more active children.35
Some researchers attribute the increasing prevalence
of overweight among school-aged children to de-
creased physical activity as a result of television
watching.49 Others, however, insist that the link be-
tween television and fatness is weak.50
Because of an increase in the percentage of high
birth weight infants, the relationship between birth
weight and overweight during childhood has be-
come a concern. From 1971 through 1985 there was
an increase in the proportion of high birth weight
infants (4000 g) for both white and black infants.51
A small positive relationship has been found be-
tween birth weight and BMI. However, there was no
indication that an increase in the distribution of birth
weights would lead to increased prevalence of over-
weight during childhood.52
Cross-sectional surveys such as those used in this
analysis cannot investigate growth patterns in individ-
uals. Moreover, the statistical definition of overweight
is not based on risks of morbidity and mortality, and
cross-sectional population-based estimates of over-
weight do not account for variation associated with
genetic predisposition of the individual or familial pat-
terns of overweight. In pediatric clinics, these are im-
portant considerations and should be considered along
with an assessment of the individual based on serial
measures of stature or length and weight over time.
The increasing prevalence of overweight among 4-
to 5-year-old children indicates that prevention ac-
tivities need to begin in the preschool years. As rec-
ommended in the Dietary Guidelines for Ameri-
cans,25 these efforts include encouraging physical
activity to maintain a healthy weight, eating at least
five servings of fruits and vegetables per day, and
after the age of 2 years gradually decreasing dietary
fat to a level of no more than 30% of energy. The
Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy
of Pediatrics also recommends energy balance over
specific caloric intake restrictions for obese chil-
dren.53 The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children and Head Start are
potential avenues for educating low-income parents
and children about healthy behavior choices such as
lower-fat foods and physical activity. In addition,
preschool and day care programs might include
more education related to diet and physical activity.
It is important to encourage healthy choices re-
garding diet and physical activity during the pre-
school years, because behavior patterns may begin in
these years.54,55 In addition, the normal growth of a
child is such that a child's adiposity during the first
year of life increases rapidly then decreases until
approximately 6 years of age, when adiposity again

develops. Young children who go through this "ad-
iposity rebound" early (4 and 5 years of age) have
higher adiposity in adulthood than children who go
through the adiposity rebound later.56 The increase
in the prevalence of overweight reported among
adults, school-aged children, and preschoolers
makes it even more critical to influence behavior
among preschoolers. It has been suggested that the
most successful treatment of preadolescent obesity is
early and regular treatment and that this preferred
approach be adapted for prevention activities during
the preschool years.57 An observational study of
white middle-class 3- to 5-year-old children found
that modifiable risk factors such as dietary intake
and physical activity accounted for more of the vari-
ance in BMI in a 3-year period than did nonmodifi-
able risk factors such as obese parents. The authors
concluded that encouragement of healthy diets and
physical activity can decrease weight gain in pre-
school children.58
Pediatric practitioners should emphasize the im-
portance of diet and physical activity as two impor-
tant components of a healthy lifestyle, with consid-
erably more emphasis on adequate amounts of
physical activity. Continued clinical, community,
and national monitoring and surveillance of weight
among preschool children is essential. To investigate
factors associated with overweight among preschool
children further, assessments of dietary habits and
activity levels are needed for different sociocultural
groups.
