Introduction
Research suggests that mindfulness demonstrates notable
benefits in both mental and physical health (Greeson, 2009;
Grossman, Tiefenthaler-Gilmer, Raysz, & Kesper, 2007; Gu,
Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh, 2015; O'Reilly, Cook, Sprujit-
Metz, & Black, 2014). Mindfulness has been described as an
awareness that emerges through purposefully paying atten-
tion to what is taking place in the present moment with a
nonjudgmental attitude (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). The effects of
mindfulness training through meditation have been investi-
gated, with results suggesting that it is beneficial to mental
health (e.g., reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
stress--Schreiner & Malcolm, 2008). Other researchers have
found that mindfulness meditation assisted in weight loss
(Dalen et al., 2010; Daubenmier et al., 2011; Mantzios &
Wilson, 2015a). However, Mantzios and Wilson (2014)
observed that although mindfulness meditation was effective
in terms of assisting weight loss, the practice was not contin-
ued once weight loss had been achieved. It would appear that
mindfulness meditation was used in the same way that
restrictive diets are used, that is, achievable as a short-term
solution for weight loss, but difficult to adhere to in the lon-
ger term. The authors considered that an alternative, event-
based and eating-specific mindful method might assist
people more effectively in both weight loss and maintenance
(see Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b).
However, mindfulness adapted to fit into an eating con-
text was described earlier in literature as mindful eating,
which was defined as an association between eating and a
nonjudgmental awareness of physical and emotional sensa-
tions (Framson et al., 2009). Present moment attention of
taste, texture, and smell, as well as satiety cues and the pres-
ence of thoughts and emotions associated with the eating
experience were described as key characteristics of eating
mindfully. Mindful eating has been associated to lower body
mass index (BMI; Moor, Scott, & McIntosh, 2013), lower
servings of energy-dense foods (Beshara, Hutchinson, &
Wilson, 2013), and healthier food choices (Kidd, Graor, &
Murrock, 2013), which are relevant to obesity prevention
and applicable to various weight groups. Therefore, in many
ways, the event-based and eating-specific mindful method
that was developed by Mantzios and Wilson (2014) assimi-
lates the definition and characteristics of mindful eating,
although these assumptions lack empirical findings.
More specifically, Mantzios and Wilson (2014) combined
mindfulness with construal-level theory to develop a diary,

Mindful Construal Diaries: A Less
Anxious, More Mindful, and More
Self-Compassionate Method of Eating
Misba Hussein1, Helen Egan1, and Michail Mantzios1
Abstract
Mindful construal diaries were found to assist in weight regulation during a long-term intervention. The current study
attempted to expand previous findings by testing the consideration (or priming) of questions within the diary (instead of filling
in the answers), and investigated levels of state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety in an observational trial
of pre- to postintervention. Forty-five participants completed State Mindfulness, State Self-Compassion, and State Anxiety
scales before and after their meal and were asked to read and consider the mindful concrete construal diary questions.
The results illustrate that state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety levels were significantly improved (i.e.,
increased mindfulness and self-compassion, and decreased anxiety) after participation. Findings provide further evidence as
to why the diaries might work in supporting weight regulation, and suggest another method of making eating more mindful.
Current findings, limitations, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

and found that the use of these mindful construal diaries
(MCDs) provided similar results in weight loss when com-
pared with a group that used mindfulness meditation for 5
weeks, and delayed weight regain over meditation at a
3-month follow-up. Construal-level theory describes an
identification on a close or distant continuum (Liberman &
Trope, 1998). Whereas close objects, events, or individuals
are represented as concrete, distant objects, events, and indi-
viduals are portrayed as abstract. Abstract construals con-
sider "why"' actions are being performed, whereas concrete
construals focus on "how" they carry out behavior (Freitas,
Gollwitzer, & Trope, 2004). Mantzios and Wilson (2014)
suggested that concrete construals (a) promoted attention to
the present behavior and (b) they focus on the how of the cur-
rent behavior rarely required or prompted further judgment
or self-critical attitudes, factors that theoretically link mind-
fulness and self-compassion to concrete construals, and
make it a suitable tool for cultivating mindfulness and self-
compassion outside the traditional routes of meditation.
Their results demonstrated that concrete construal diaries are
significantly more effective in improving mindfulness and
self-compassion than abstract construal diaries, which served
them with justification as to how the diaries can assist weight
management. Although the diaries have been found to assist
weight regulation, the specific conduit of the effect, whether
they decrease anxiety, depression, or increase mindfulness
and self-compassion during each meal, are presently
unknown and warrant further research.
Three topics are explored in the current study as possible
mechanisms of aiding weight regulation with the use of
MCD, namely, mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxiety.
First, the original study used the Mindful Attention and
Awareness Scale (MAAS), which measures an increase in
present moment awareness, but does not explore the non-
judgmental component of mindfulness. The authors and
developers of this diary suggested that further research
should be conducted with the help of other psychometric
tools. Therefore, further research incorporating a more holis-
tic measure of mindfulness was used to observe increases in
mindfulness, and further explain previous weight regulation
findings.
Second, previous research suggested that the use of the
MCD could, over a period of 5 weeks, increase self-compas-
sion (Mantzios & Wilson, 2014). Self-compassion is
described as taking a kinder approach to oneself with a mind-
ful awareness and consideration of personal difficulties as
being part of a shared human experience (Neff, 2003). The
diary prompted people to be more self-compassionate
through priming, through the inclusion of self-compassion-
ate questions. Adams and Leary (2007) conducted the initial
research, which used priming (i.e., activation of the self-
compassionate concept through text that was read to partici-
pants to elicit changes in later behaviors) to increase
self-compassion. They replicated another original experi-
ment, whereby people who broke their diet increased their
food intake afterward (i.e., disinhibition--see Herman &
Mack, 1975), but primed half of their participants to be more
self-compassionate. They found that those who were induced
with a self-compassionate message did not increase their
food intake. Therefore, self-compassion can be used as a
coping mechanism with personal failings (without overeat-
ing), and in turn, aid in weight regulation.
The role of self-compassion has been highlighted in relation
to mindfulness and eating. For example, research has found that
participation in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
programs increased self-compassion levels, which mediated
reductions in stress (Shapiro, Astin, Bishop, & Cordova, 2005),
although stress has been found to increase food consumption
(Greeno &Wing, 1994).While self-compassion may strengthen
the effectiveness of mindfulness, further research suggested that
self-compassion relates to mindful eating (Webb, Jafari,
Schoenefeld, & Hardin, 2013), intuitive eating (Schoenefeld &
Webb, 2013), and increasing health behavior intentions (Sirois,
2015). Therefore, the increase of self-compassion may be a
helpful component to assist and support mindfulness, which
may further assist weight regulation. As such, recent research
has found that interventions combining both mindfulness and
self-compassion assist people in weight loss more than interven-
tions involving mindfulness alone (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015a;
Mantzios, Wilson, Linnell, & Morris, 2015). The present study
further investigated whether using the diary in one session
increases state levels of self-compassion.
Third, the possible reduction of anxiety, which is, the ten-
dency to perceive stressors as threatening, therefore causing
emotional,cognitive,andphysiologicalreactions(Spielberger,
Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983), may be another
mechanism of the success of MCD that merits further
research. Research has demonstrated that an increase in both
mindfulness and self-compassion has been associated with
reductions in trait and state anxiety (e.g., Bergen-Cico &
Cheon, 2013), while anxiety has also been found to predict
weight gain and obesity (Ostrovsky, Swencionis, Wylie-
Rosett, & Isasi, 2013; Polivy, Herman, & McFarlane, 1994;
Roberts & Duong, 2016). Therefore, the possibility of lower-
ing anxiety through the MCD may further explain positive
weight-related outcomes.
This study significantly differs in three ways from the orig-
inal research conducted with MCD. First, the present research
explores increasing mindfulness and self-compassion, and
decreasing anxiety through state scales during a single meal
(compared with a 5-week intervention). If one session can
induce these elements and reduce distress, this would enable
the reduction of training and cost in contemporary health care
to treat and prevent problematic eating and overeating. To
date, mindfulness interventions require several weeks or
months of committed practice (e.g., Daubenmier et al., 2011),
and single intervention sessions have been unsuccessful in
improving eating behaviors, although vigorous methodologies
and higher sample sizes may offer further support for single
intervention sessions (e.g., Jacobs, Cardaciotto, Block-Lerner,
Hussein et al. 3
& McMahon, 2013). Second, measuring anxiety may provide
another explanation for why the diaries may work given the
positive relationship to overeating, and the negative relation-
ship to mindfulness and self-compassion explored earlier.
Third, participants were asked only to consider the questions,
rather than write them down in their diary. The rationale for
this change in methodology was to make the use of such dia-
ries as easy as possible, and to create more of a priming tool.
This consideration is more conducive to mindful eating, where
commitment to writing in the diaries may be more likely to
distract from the actual behavior performed. Previous research
has demonstrated that distractions such as watching television
or socializing can lead to mindless eating behaviors (Ogden
et al., 2013). Overall, this type of engagement with the diary is
more user friendly, requires even less effort, and may, there-
fore, improve the adherence to mindful eating after weight
loss in future interventions.
Therefore, the present study explored whether MCD can
improve state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state
anxiety. The following was hypothesized:
Hypothesis 1: The use of the MCD will increase levels of
state mindfulness and state self-compassion, and reduce
state anxiety.
Method
Participants
Forty-five students attending a university in Birmingham,
the United Kingdom, were invited to participate in the pres-
ent study via email invitations or were approached face to
face. Three participants did not meet the set BMI (i.e., BMI
< 18.5), and were excluded from the final analyses. Another
two participants were excluded, one did not complete any
post questionnaires, whereas another failed to engage with
the diary and adhere to the study protocol (i.e., participant
had a phone conversation throughout the entire duration of
the study, which created a multitasking and mindless con-
text). As a result, five participants were excluded in total
from the final analysis. The final sample consisted of 28
females and 12 males with an overall BMI of M = 22.83 (SD
= 3.47, range = 19.04-35.86), and an age M = 21.83 years
(SD = 2.92 years). The sample consisted of different ethnici-
ties: White British (n = 8), Black (n = 6), Mixed (n = 2),
Indian (n = 9), Pakistani (n = 13), and Arab (n = 2).
Eligibility. Participants were not eligible to participate if they
had been diagnosed with an eating disorder and if they were
below the age of 18.
Instruments
Participant information form. This form asked for participant's
age, weight, height, gender, and ethnicity, as well as the last
time they ate a meal and their smoking/exercising habits.
State Mindfulness Scale.The State Mindfulness Scale is a
21-item self-report measure that assesses mindfulness with
scores ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very well), with total
scores varying from 21 to 105 (Tanay & Bernstein, 2013).
This scale reflects on traditional and contemporary psycho-
logical science models of mindfulness. It includes items such
as I noticed emotions come and go and I felt in contact with
my body. Higher scores indicate higher levels of mindful-
ness, and the scale has shown to be stable over time when
investigated in mindfulness interventions, as well as high
construct and predicted criterion validity (Tanay & Bern-
stein, 2013). In the current study, the alpha was .922 pre- and
.942 postinterventions.
State Self-Compassion Scale.
The State Self-Compassion
Scale is an adapted version of the Neff's (2003) original
State Self-Compassion Scale with an internal consistency of
.76 (Breines & Chen, 2013). The scale was adapted to adjust
the statements to the present moment. For example, instead
of stating "I'm trying to be kind and reassuring to myself,"
the statement was worded as "Right now, I am trying to be
kind and reassuring to myself." The scale is composed of six
subscales: Self-Kindness, Self-Judgment, Common Human-
ity, Isolation, Mindfulness, and Overidentification. It con-
sists 16 items and is reworded to reflect a state scale. It
includes items such as Right now, I am trying to be under-
standing towards myself or It's okay to make mistakes, and
responses range from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly
agree), with overall scores ranging from 16 to 112 (Breines
& Chen, 2013). In the current study, the alpha was .774 pre-
intervention and .758 postintervention.
State Anxiety Scale.A shortened version of the Spielberger
State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI; Spielberger, Gorsuch,
& Lushene, 1970) was used, which consisted of six items to
measure state anxiety. Responses range from 1 (not at all) to
4 (very much) and overall scores range from 6 to 24, with
higher scores indicating higher levels of anxiety (Marteau &
Bekker, 1992). Sample items are I am tense or I feel content.
In the current study, the alpha was .836 preintervention and
.815 postintervention.
Mindful concrete construal diary.A diary of questions based on
concrete construals, mindful awareness, and self-compassion-
ate messages was given to participants during a mealtime,
which required them to consider how to eat, with questions
such as, "How does it smell?" "How do I show kindness to
myself now that I am eating healthily?" or "How do you feel
and what passes through your mind now that you are eating this
meal?" (Mantzios & Wilson, 2014; please see the appendix).
Procedure
Participants either responded to an advertisement of a study
regarding state psychological dimensions of personality and
4 SAGE Open
eating behavior or were approached face to face. Participants
received a participant information sheet and those who
agreed to take part in the study gave informed consent before
the start of the experiment. Once informed consent was
gained, a set of demographic questions and three scales on
state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state anxiety
were given to participants before their meal. Next, partici-
pants were given a food diary to use during their mealtime
and were asked to consider the questions in the diary while
eating their own provided meal in the laboratory. To avoid
any distractions, the experimenter was sitting behind the par-
ticipant during the meal to allow full engagement with the
diary and food, and tested one participant at a time. The food
consumed varied among participants, as the researcher
instructed them not to change or alter their usual eating
behaviors and choices. Most participants chose to purchase
their meal while on university grounds, which consisted of a
sandwich, with or without a small bag of chips, and a soft
drink or water. Other participants brought in other foods that
were purchased from local supermarkets or homemade
meals, such as couscous with roasted vegetables, pasta sal-
ads, pasta with sauce, or different curries with rice. A record
of food and amounts consumed during the experiment was
not kept. Once they considered the questions in the diary and
finished their meal, they were then asked to complete another
set of the state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and state
anxiety scales. The initial advertisement of the study and
information in the participant information sheet about the
true purpose and aim of the study was intentionally left vague
to prevent participant bias. Therefore, a funneled debriefing
also occurred with four questions, beginning with a general
format ("During the process of completing the question-
naires, did you notice anything in particular?") to more spe-
cific questions ("If you were to guess, what would you
assume the aim of this study was?") to inform the researchers
whether or not participants were aware of the aims of the
study. Finally, the participants were debriefed and thanked
for their participation. Note that participants volunteered and
did not receive any incentives.
Design and Statistical Analysis
Three repeated measures analyses (paired sample t tests)
were conducted on pre- and postdiary scores of self-compas-
sion, mindfulness, and anxiety.
Results
The funneled debriefing procedure indicated that the partici-
pants were not aware of the aims of the study. Three separate
paired sample t tests were conducted between pre- and post-
measurements on mindfulness, self-compassion, and anxi-
ety. For mindfulness, the paired sample t test showed that
post­state mindfulness scores (M = 71.88, SD = 17.33) sig-
nificantly increased from pre­state mindfulness scores (M =
61.43, SD = 18.47), t(39) = 3.82, p < .001. The mean differ-
ence between the pre- and posttime conditions was 10.45
(SD = 17.32) and the 95% confidence interval for the esti-
mated population mean differences is between 4.91 and
15.99. The effect size was medium (d = 0.58).
For self-compassion, the paired sample t test showed that
post­state self-compassion scores (M = 82.93, SD = 10.52)
significantly increased from pre­state self-compassion
scores (M = 78.03, SD = 9.83), t(39) = 3.34, p = .002. The
mean difference between the pre- and postconditions was
4.90 (SD = 9.27) and the 95% confidence interval for the
estimated population mean difference is 1.93 and 7.87. The
effect was moderate (d = 0.48).
Last, for anxiety, the paired sample t test showed that
post­state anxiety scores significantly improved (M = 20.66,
SD = 3.62) from pre­state anxiety scores (M = 18.30, SD =
4.32), t(39) = 4.40, p < .001. The mean difference between
the pre- and postconditions was 6.38 (SD = 8.54), and the
95% confidence interval for the estimated population mean
difference is between 1.28 and 3.47. The effect was medium
(d = 0.59). Note that controlling for BMI and gender did not
differ the outcomes reported above.
Discussion
The present study suggests that the mindful concrete con-
strual diary intervention increased state mindfulness and
state self-compassion and decreased state anxiety. Current
findings are significant for three main reasons. First, past
research found that the participants who report greater mind-
fulness in everyday life have positive eating behaviors and
healthier eating practices (Bowlin & Baer, 2012) and are able
to regulate their weight (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b;
Mantzios, Wilson, Linnell, & Morris, 2015). Mindfulness-
based interventions targeting eating behaviors have gained
popularity in recent years with a specific focus placed upon
obesity-related behaviors (Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b). Such
interventions aim to facilitate the repatterning of automatic
behavior by encouraging oneself to distinguish between
emotional arousal and physical hunger cues (Sojcher, Gould-
Fogerite, & Perlman, 2012).
However, for such interventions to be successful, they
require several weeks or months of sessions (Daubenmier
et al., 2011; Mantzios & Wilson, 2015b), and to date, exer-
cises employing a single intervention session have found to
be ineffective in improving eating behaviors (Jacobs et al.,
2013). This research, although practically different from pre-
vious studies, has been found to be effective after a single
session. Second, this experiment attempted to test the effec-
tiveness of the diary without writing the answers, but by sim-
ply considering the items. The use of priming has become a
prevalent method of inducing state psychological dimen-
sions of personality such as mindfulness and self-compas-
sion (Leary, Tate, Adams, Batts-Allen, & Hancock, 2007;
Mantzios & Wilson, 2014; Zabelina & Robinson, 2010).
Hussein et al. 5
Participants are often required to think about items or nega-
tive events and are then prompted to write, think, or listen to
messages in a mindful or self-compassionate manner. For
example, when inducing a self-compassionate state to evoke
a common humanity perspective, participants would be
required to write about the event in ways that other people
would also experience a similar event (Leary et al., 2007;
Zabelina & Robinson, 2010). The findings from studies uti-
lizing such methodologies of priming were found to signifi-
cantly increase levels of self-compassion (Leary et al., 2007;
Zabelina & Robinson, 2010). However, the act of writing
may be felt as consciously effortful, and in turn, may not be
adhered to. A study found that listening to a speech endorsed
with components of self-compassion was substantial to
increase levels of self-compassion, and in turn, improved
restrictive eaters' attitudes toward eating after a preload of
unhealthy food (Adams & Leary, 2007). Similarly, in the cur-
rent study, it was found that the simple method of consider-
ing items was sufficient to induce mindfulness and
self-compassion and to reduce anxiety. This makes the mind-
ful concrete construal diary more user friendly as it requires
less conscious effort. Not writing and eating may allow the
participants to place a higher focus upon their food, and in
turn, be more mindful. Research has shown that the act of
multitasking may lead to participants' cognitive processes
becoming less mindful and more automatic, which partially
explains the strict adherence and exclusion of participants in
the current study.
Limitations and Future Direction
Overall, six limitations have been identified that require fur-
ther research. First, future research should use a compari-
son/control group, to enhance our understanding of variances
between a diary and nondiary group. Second, the use of stu-
dents, who tend to be more anxious than the general popula-
tion (Bayram & Bilgel, 2008), which in turn, may make
them less self-compassionate and mindful as a group may be
problematic. In addition, the ethnic diversity further limits
the generalization of results, especially when considering
the variety of foods, at times atypical of Western diets, as
well as homemade meals that were consumed during the
experiment. However, the food was typical to their everyday
eating behaviors, which adds some ecological validity to the
classic laboratory setting that is utilized in these types of
experiments. Generalizing and interpreting the current
results should occur with caution until further research
becomes available.
Third, the current study did not investigate the amount of
food consumed, and therefore, was unable to investigate the
extent and potential relationship between mindfulness, self-
compassion, anxiety, and overeating during the experiments.
Past research has revealed differences in food intake between
restrictive and nonrestrictive eaters in terms of the disinhibi-
tion effect (i.e., the shame of consuming high caloric food and
in turn overeating; Herman & Mack, 1975). Self-compassion
has in turn shown to mediate the effect of disinhibition among
highly restrictive eaters (Adams & Leary, 2007).
Fourth, the majority of the participants within the current
study had a healthy weight, and follow-up research with
overweight and obese individuals is required. Finally, as the
participants in the current study did not write out answers,
they may not have fully adhered to the guidelines of the
experiment, in terms of possibly failing to adequately con-
sider the questions 5 min before the meal or rereading the
questions once completing the first set.
Future research needs to methodologically control for
such possible nonengagement, to allow for the possibility of
exclusion from the final analyses of experiments. Keeping a
time record would allow for a fuller understanding of the
interaction of time taken to complete the meal with other fac-
tors such as anxiety, mindfulness, and degree of engagement.
Furthermore, future research investigating the effectiveness
of the mindful concrete construal diary intervention should
utilize both restrictive and nonrestrictive eaters, conducting
the experiment at similar times and days, and provide a stan-
dardized meal to each participant recruit members of the
general population.
Conclusion
To conclude, the use of an MCD with self-compassionate
messages in the present study was significantly effective in
improving state mindfulness, state self-compassion, and
state anxiety. However, further research is required, experi-
mental and with populations of a higher weight, given the
limitations suggested earlier. Possible explanations of why
the diaries work may assist in making recommendations of
improvement and effectiveness, which may assist implemen-
tation of future weight regulation tools in clinical practice.

you from the meal, then consider them without writing. However, keep those questions in mind by revisiting them as often as
you can. Ideally, you should look at the questions and consider them prior to your meal.
Initially, let's get into the experience of
eating. Focus on the next three questions for
the first 2 minutes and take your time to
incorporate the smell, taste, and texture of this meal.
How does this meal taste?
How does this meal smell?
What are the colors and texture of it?
OK, now it is all about you!
Try to revisit the questions above every 2 or 3 minutes.
How important is it for me and all people to eat healthy?
How do you feel and what passes through your mind now that you are eating this meal?
How kind are you to yourself now that you eat this meal?
How understanding and kind are my thoughts and feelings now that I am eating this meal?
How understanding and patient am I now that thoughts and feelings are intruding this pleasurable experience?
How understanding and patient am I now that this meal is not a satisfying experience?
How do I show kindness to myself now that I am eating healthily?
How important is this meal right now?
Please note that spaces were wider apart for participants in the original study. Questions were spread in 2 × A5 size pages
in the diary, where participants could see all of them while eating.
