Higher education of mental health professionals faces the
overwhelming complexity of the mental health field--a field
infested with personal distress, professional disagreement,
conceptual confusion, cultural clashes, political and ideo-
logical debate, and commercial competition (Bracken &
Thomas, 2005). Human existence colors the field's surface
and determines its depth. The phenomena involved are as
human as can be; everything in the mental health field is
about man and thus as complicated as we are (May, Angel, &
Ellenberger, 1958). This is reflected in the plethora of profes-
sions and sciences that act and reflect on mental health in
some shape or form. Philosophy, theology, sociology, social
work, the psy-sciences, medicine, neurobiology, and others
contribute with influential perspectives on mental health;
these perspectives are influential, but not necessarily compat-
ible or mutually reducible. The history and theory of mental
health is inflamed with debate and controversy, within and
between the sciences, professions, and clients (cf. Coppock &
Hopton, 2000; Szasz, 2008). These debates often extend to
politics and ideology: At stake is not only what is healthy or
pathological, effective or relevant, but also what is normal or
asocial, morally good or bad. In short, between the mutuality
of human existence and mental health, and the related scien-
tific-professional debates, emerges a field that is of over-
whelming complexity for any scientist, professional care
worker, and educator.
In its effort to handle this complexity, professional higher
education of mental health workers creates access to this
field by excluding large parts of it and including only a few
preferred areas--compartimentalization is preferred to inter-
disciplinarity (cf. Hillocks, 1999). Compartmentalization
supports established professional boundaries and is sustained
by conventional pedagogy, that is, pedagogy that teaches
information and skills based on accepted theory without spe-
cific regard to the student's own experience from the field
and his or her individual learning process (Dahlberg,
Ekebergh, & Ironside, 2003; Ironside, 2001). In this article,
we present an alternative solution to accessing the mental
health field in the higher education of adult students.
Phenomenology provides both the rationale that undergirds
our pedagogy and the research method that the students learn
to use to advance the knowledge base of their practice. We
first describe and then reflect on our phenomenology-based
curriculum that teaches adult students how to use their own
life and work experiences as a privileged starting point for
professional development. In conclusion, we suggest that

Phenomenological Pedagogy in Higher
Education of Mental Health Workers: An
Example From Norway
Rob Bongaardt1, Gro Frøyen1 and Olav Tangvald-Pedersen1
Abstract
This article describes the use of phenomenological pedagogy in the higher education of mental health workers. The mental
health field is an immensely complex professional field. To create access, the conventional education of mental health
professionals compartmentalizes the field according to traditional professional boundaries. Personal­professional expertise
and user preference are thereby lost. Such personal experience is privileged in a pedagogy based on Giorgi's descriptive
phenomenological method. Students learn systematically to describe a mental health phenomenon of their interest and
reflect on this using each other's professional insights as well as relevant research literature. Phenomenological description
and reflection are repeated several times in the curriculum. Kegan's subject­object theory of adult development explains
how this repetition may support transformation of insight in rather than an accumulation of information about mental health
work. The complexity of the mental health field thus emerges as a source of knowledge to exploit rather than merely a
rugged landscape to navigate.

phenomenological pedagogy promotes the integration of
personal, relational and research-based knowledge, which is
invaluable for crossing traditional professional boundaries
and transforming the student's professional competency.
Interdisciplinarity and Evidence-Based
Practice (EBP) in the Norwegian State
Curriculum
To overcome profession-based compartmentalization, the
Norwegian government has decreed a national standard cur-
riculum for all postgraduate education in mental health work
(Forskrift til rammeplan for videreutdanning i psykisk hel-
searbeid, 2005; henceforth referred to as the "state curricu-
lum"). The backdrop for this state curriculum was a
mid-1990s report (the first of its kind in Norway) about the
Norwegian mental health services that concluded that these
services had "cracks at all levels." The treatment levels, from
prevention and community services to institution-based
treatment and follow-up after discharge, were so weak that
the users of the services missed out on help needed, and the
health care workers could not work satisfactorily (Norwegian
Government White Paper No. 25, 1996-1997). Later, it was
pointed out that the report could even have understated the
situation, missing out on problems such as one-sided (bio-
medical) views of mental illness and treatment, upholding
societal us­them distinctions, and skewed power balances in
face-to-face treatment situations (Østravik, 2008); all of
these are consistent with compartmentalization and conven-
tional pedagogy. There was enough ground, in other words,
for the development of a new national curriculum in mental
health work at the postgraduate level.
The state curriculum aims to improve and equalize the
standard of the mental health work competency of all profes-
sional groups within Norway's health and social services.
Mental health is to be understood as a relational phenome-
non, making compulsory a relational perspective on the cli-
ent, and his or her social network and environment. The
curriculum emphasizes the relationship between and among
workers and clients. The psychiatric perspectives on mental
illness and psychiatric nursing are thus to become subservi-
ent to a larger constellation bringing together the perspec-
tives of many professions and approaches (such as social
work, psychomotor therapy, child care, and psychiatric nurs-
ing), and the services at various levels of organization within
the health care system. A vision of interdisciplinary collabo-
ration hence underpins the program.
With hindsight, we recognize that the state has also cre-
ated a platform for learning EBP. The best available research
knowledge from various academic fields is to be applied by
the professional expert who, preferably together with col-
leagues, judges the demands of the actual clinical situation in
concordance with the client's expressed preferences (Melnyk
& Fineout-Overholt, 2005). But in contradiction to
evidence-based medicine, where research-based knowledge
often takes precedence over client experience, the state cur-
riculum promotes EBP in which the client's individual
"resources, wishes and needs" are the starting point for care
and treatment (Forskrift til rammeplan for videreutdanning i
psykisk helsearbeid, 2005, Section 2; authors' translation).
Client collaboration, empowerment, and relational work
become obligatory teaching topics. The client is placed at the
core of mental health work, along with interdisciplinarity
and EBP.
Although the main intention of the state curriculum is to
ensure a higher and stable standard of teaching countrywide,
it leaves room for developing educational solutions depen-
dent on regional circumstances. We have embraced this room
because neither "interdisciplinarity" nor "EBP" reduce the
complexity of the field sufficiently; there is still too much
uncertainty for a postgraduate 1-year program. How does our
pedagogical approach simplify the complexity that remains
after the state curriculum?
Embedded Alternation of Description
and Reflection in Our Curriculum
Our postgraduate program at a university college in the
southeast of Norway is the equivalent of 1 year's full-time
study, divided equally over four semesters part-time. About
35 adult students are enrolled annually. Almost all have prac-
tical experience from a health or social care profession.
Many of them return to higher education with the aim to sat-
isfy personal­professional or, in some cases, employer inter-
ests. The typical expectation is to acquire more and newer
information about mental illness and how to treat it. However,
we consider that meeting the expectation of providing more
information would imply a pedagogy that sustains compart-
mentalization: It would force us to determine beforehand
which themes to include and exclude in our program, regard-
less of the enrolled student group. Furthermore, we do not
regard our students and the professional field as separate
units that must be bridged by an information load. That is
because our students are already part of the field. Therefore,
we see it as our task to teach students how to emerge from
their embeddedness in this complex field--that is, how to
transform their way of knowing the field (Mayo, 2003).
Each student brings into our program experiences at the
personal, relational, and organizational levels of work and
life. They are all much more simply human than otherwise
(Sullivan, 1953, p. 32; italics in original) and, between them,
the students personify the mental health field as it transpires
in Norway. These professional and personal experiences may
not be representative of how we prefer professionals to act
and reflect after completion of their studies. But then, we do
not aspire to teach people what they already know; the stu-
dents'existing knowledge rather forms a solid base on which
to build our teaching. Therefore, we anchor our pedagogy in
Bongaardt et al. 3
phenomenology. Phenomenology sets out to grasp our exis-
tence from the inside out, where its passionate roots lie, on
exactly those grounds that many of our students based their
choice of profession (cf. Jager, 1989). Rather than taking pri-
macy in rational accounts of life and living, phenomenology
suspends the use of concepts and brackets common-sense
idioms. Within this so-called phenomenological reduction,
one withholds from existential claims: Instead of pondering
the reality status or truth of the phenomenon within the world
of measurable biology, psychology, or sociology, phenome-
nology opts to linger with how a phenomenon's form and
content constitute meaning in the consciousness of the per-
son who experiences it. However, it is not correct to con-
clude that phenomenology is a mere solipsistic or solitary
enterprise. It can involve a number of people; phenomeno-
logical researchers within psychology collect descriptions
from various experiencing persons that, via systematic anal-
ysis, reveal the essence of the phenomenon (Giorgi, 2009).
The analysis process can also be a joint venture--and it is
especially in this way that phenomenology can reach out to
pedagogy (e.g., Dall'Alba, 2009; Østergaard, Dahlin, &
Hugo, 2008; van Manen, 1990).
We apply Husserl's phenomenology as modified by
Giorgi (2009) for use in psychology. Giorgi's phenomeno-
logical research method leads to descriptions of human phe-
nomena relevant for psychology, such as learning, depression,
or becoming a parent. These descriptions are preferably min-
imally colored by theoretical or common-sense understand-
ing of the phenomenon at hand--Husserl spoke of returning
to the "thing itself." Giorgi's phenomenology doubles as a
research method that our students learn to enable them to
analyze data derived from first-person experiences and a
rationale that shapes our curriculum. We explicate this fur-
ther in what follows, where we describe the six-phase com-
position of one large part of our program, which we refer to
as the critical-analytical part. The other parts of our program
pertain, respectively, to practicing relational skills and the
national laws and formal regulations of Norwegian mental
health work. A full discussion of these two other parts is
beyond the scope of this article, but we sketch "practicing
relational skills" in our description of Phase 5.
Phase 1: Describing Experiences of Good Mental
Health and Meeting Mental Illness
Collection of data and analysis are related yet distinct parts
of any research process. In our curriculum, we also distin-
guish between these two parts. Early in the program, we col-
lect the students' previous experiences of "good mental
health" and "meeting mental suffering." These two phenom-
ena represent key experiences in the mental health field at
opposite ends of a long continuum. We invite students to
write a response to the following stimuli: Please describe in
detail a situation in which you experienced good mental
health; and Please describe in detail your first encounter
with mental suffering. There is no need to use theoretical
concepts or professional jargon in your descriptions. We ask
for "experience" to focus on a specific situation or encounter
as a bearer of personal meaning and to avoid ending up with
generic "reflections" that may have been formed later else-
where. Through a detailed account, we hope to tease out
exhaustive descriptions that make visible the smallest expe-
rienced happenings (Stern, 2004). We use the "good mental
health" descriptions as a base for a plenary discussion in
class about what mental health workers expect of their own
mental health and what they expect service users to achieve
through care or treatment (Tangvald-Pedersen & Bongaardt,
2011). The "meeting mental suffering" descriptions typically
contain (in a class of 35) five to six main themes, such as
depression, family care, incest, therapeutic power balance,
and professional uncertainty. These themes form the basis
for further analysis and hence are the starting point for the
critical-analytical part of the program, which runs until the
last day of teaching.
We divide the class into six interdisciplinary groups, and
assign one theme to each group. Then the groups select four
or five texts (from about 35) concerning their respective
themes. Next, each group analyzes these descriptions along
clearly demarcated steps as recommended by Giorgi (2009).
We urge the students to refrain from theoretical or common-
sense interpretation during the analysis and to dwell on the
data to let the phenomenon "speak for itself." We explain
that this so-called "phenomenological attitude" is not unlike
"withholding judgment" in therapeutic settings, which are
discussed later in the study. Step 1 in the analysis consists of
each group member reading carefully all selected descrip-
tions to get a sense of the entire phenomenon at hand. In Step 2,
the students jointly mark each text every time they sense a
shift in the meaning of the writer's subject matter, resulting
in a division of each text into so-called meaning units. In
Step 3, these meaning units are rewritten in a language typi-
cal of the mental health field as understood by the group. The
result is that the texts under analysis are rewritten in similar
and more easily comparable language. In Step 4, the result-
ing rewritten meaning units may now be clustered across the
texts forming core constituents of the phenomenon at hand.
Step 5 involves the students writing a summary of what the
phenomenon entails. In this summary, the phenomenon's
core constituents are related to each other, and as parts of a
whole form one meaning structure. This task completes the
initial phase.
Phase 2: Reflecting Theoretically on a Theme
Within the Phenomenological Description
Here, we leave the phenomenological reduction and open up
for reflection on the description. The three modes of reflec-
tion presented are from a cause­effect, social context, and
4 SAGE Open
human-existential perspective. The groups choose one per-
spective and are advised to use the library under supervision
to find up-to-date research that, from their chosen perspec-
tive of reflection, can shed further light on the phenomenon
at hand. For instance, if the described phenomenon was "liv-
ing in a family where one of the parents is diagnosed with a
major depression," one of the following reflections is possi-
ble: Epidemiological research shows an increased risk of
children becoming depressed later in life when one or two
parents have a diagnosed major depression--a cause­effect
perspective. Or qualitative research demonstrates that living
with a depressed parent may be experienced positively, lead-
ing the individual to spread a message of hope among others
in the same situation--a human-existential perspective. Or it
may be pointed out that such family experiences are seldom
reported in the popular media, which prefer to uphold a cul-
tural image of happy nuclear families, implicitly evoking
shame among those who do not meet such societal stan-
dards--a (critical) social context perspective.
This phase is completed with a group paper, which must
incorporate the phenomenological meaning structure and
research-based reflection, and largely follow the IMRAD
format: introduction, method, result, and discussion (Day,
1989).
Phase 3: Comments by a Professional Expert on
the Paper
When we know the direction of the papers, we invite local
mental health work experts to come to class and comment on
one paper each. The experts receive the papers two weeks
before the classroom session. They are asked to offer a
broader perspective or deeper insight into the theme from
their expert point of view.
Each group presents its paper to the whole class, directly
followed by the expert commentary. This situation easily
generates discussion among everyone present--students,
teachers, and experts--because reflections and descriptions
from different professional, experiential, and research per-
spectives may not easily align or may even be mutually
exclusive and controversial. This is the first time in the pro-
gram that the students engage in a discussion in an interdis-
ciplinary group of professionals about EBP that is anchored
in first-person experiences. In doing so, many may still be
embedded--unwittingly and exclusively--in the perspective
of only the experiencing person, professional expert, or
researcher.
Phase 4: Dialoguing Between the Rationale of
EBP and Hands-On Practical Experience
Through the first three phases, the students slowly build up a
sense of how three different sources of knowledge, that is,
personal experience, expert judgment, and research, mingle
and merge in a mental health issue. Many students, however,
may still be embedded in one of these perspectives. In Phase
4 of the program, we explicitly address EBP to help students
emerge from this embeddedness. We present the "who's
first" debate in the field; which of the three sources of knowl-
edge should have primacy in daily practice. We also present
the "best evidence" debate, which takes place within each of
the knowledge source areas: Which research method has
highest status? Which expert judgment carries most weight?
or Which user experience is trustworthy?
Then, we ask the students to sum up the debate in an indi-
vidual paper and take a stand based on their experiences with
past clinical practice or their expectations about future clini-
cal practice. They are encouraged to describe and analyze
these experiences or expectations using the phenomenologi-
cal method. We offer individual supervision to help the stu-
dent focus on a specific theme that somehow links his or her
understanding of the EBP debate to what he or she considers
relevant in clinical practice. "Who are you as a professional
mental health worker, viewed from the angle of evidence-
based practice?" "Where do you stand, or prefer to stand?"
When we grade these papers, we are less interested in clear
overviews of the EBP debate or univocal statements about
who the student is in a practice situation. We rather evaluate
how the student approaches the issue: To what extent is he or
she able to negotiate the ever-present ambiguity of practice
situations with the inherent uncertainty in the debates? In
other words, does the student challenge the assumptions in
the debate or challenge the perception of himself or herself at
work, as a result of the tension between the two issues? We
contend that such an exploration of the edges of knowledge
promotes the way of learning that is required in this field (see
also the "Discussion" section).
Phase 5: Practicing EBP
The students have a 10-week placement in the field where
they can practice what they have learned so far. At this point,
the "practicing skills" part of our program becomes involved.
This runs parallel with Phases 1 to 4, and focuses on practic-
ing dialogue in student groups, using role-play, video, and
written descriptions of actual situations from clinical prac-
tice. These descriptions are analyzed in plenary class ses-
sions, with special emphasis on human relational interaction,
such as how to exert good judgment in the situation.
Before the clinical placement, the students learn a super-
vision technique called "reflecting team" (Andersen, 1994).
A student group is divided into three functional units: One
person who describes a challenging situation from work
from a first-person perspective, one supervisor who guides
the process, and the rest of the group that first listens to the
description and then reflects on it. The group is not to jump
to conclusions or offer solutions. It simply reflects on the
situation described. The supervisor guards these boundaries
and will not comment on content. After the explorations, the
first person returns to the stage and conveys how his or her
Bongaardt et al. 5
understanding has advanced as a result of the group's reflec-
tions; he or she thus engages with the group in metacommu-
nication about himself or herself in the situation at hand.
Within clinical practice, each student receives an obliga-
tory assignment to define his or her learning goals, which is
evaluated halfway and on completion of the placement. The
learning goals express how the student aims to shift focus
between acting in the situation exercising relational compe-
tency and reflecting on the situation using relevant theory.
The student is expected to use judgment to situate himself or
herself correctly within the organization of the workplace
and in relation to the client. Thus EBP--balancing expert
judgment, theoretical knowledge, and clients' expressed
needs--is practiced and evaluated individually.
Phase 6: Advancing EBP Through a Research and
Development (R&D) Project
Work experiences are the starting point for an R&D project.
Groups of four to six students are invited to write a summary
of a phenomenon of their own interest stemming from a clin-
ical or work situation. This assignment is aimed at providing
a deeper understanding of this situation through theoretical
reflection. The overall objective is to contribute to EBP in
mental health work. The difference from Phases 1 and 2 is
that this phase implies collecting original data from respon-
dents in the field. For practical reasons, the respondents are
not clients but other professionals (applying for approval
from the medical research ethics committee is not feasible
within the time frame of this phase). The data can be col-
lected and analyzed using the phenomenological research
method that we have introduced earlier in the program, but
not necessarily so. Students may also opt for a theoretical
analysis of, for example, an existing mental health promo-
tion program or other interventions from the field. Strong
personal­professional engagement with the chosen phenom-
enon means that the papers may approach or even push the
frontiers of professional knowledge about the phenomenon
at hand. We often point out that the students' daily involve-
ment in professional practice makes them preferred research-
ers or developers of projects about current pressing issues in
the field.
This six-step repeated alternation between experience-
based description and research-based reflection is the how of
the program. We discuss the "how" further below. The stu-
dents determine the what of the program; they determine the
themes in focus during the various steps of the program, in
writing, practice, and supervision. As to the "what," it is
worth noting that we are still not able to cover all themes
within mental health work as deemed relevant by the state
curriculum. And most certainly, we cannot cover all the
themes relevant to mental health work at large. Our phenom-
enological approach, however, enables adult students to
access any phenomenon of relevance without being
primarily concerned with the traditional placement of this
phenomenon in the professional mental health field. As long
as they first systematically dwell with the phenomenon, and
then capitalize on each other's professional insights as well
as library services to find relevant research literature and
reviews, they can effectively cross knowledge boundaries
that previously may have constrained them. We assist adult
students in formulating an experience-based entry point and
to set out a path through the space of professional inquiry.
The complexity of the field thereby becomes a rich source of
knowledge rather than a rugged landscape impossible to
navigate.
Discussion
In short summary, the rationale of our curriculum is as fol-
lows: An individual's experience with a phenomenon is
opened up by systematic phenomenological description
stripped of theory or common sense, and closure is sought
by reflection on the phenomenon guided by its essential
features--theory follows phenomenon, not vice versa. In
structuring this article, we have tried to stay true to this
rationale. Above, we have described the background and
structure of our curriculum. In this section, we reflect on
using phenomenological description in higher education as
well as on using reflection as a means of promoting trans-
formative learning in mental health work.
Spiegelberg (1975), a philosopher and important historian
and developer of phenomenology, describes in his book
Doing Phenomenology how he toyed with the thought of a
possible "joint phenomenologizing" and then actually tried
out "cooperative phenomenology" (p. 24). At Washington
University, during five summers between 1962 and 1972, he
brought together between 7 and more than 20 persons to a
workshop. Each workshop was dedicated to the exploration
and determination of essential structures of phenomena cho-
sen beforehand or in the workshop. Spiegelberg's approach
may not have been as structured as we have described above
in Phase 1. "Steps," as in Giorgi's method, had then not been
defined as such. And the phenomenological analyses were to
be performed by the participants exclusively on their own
experiences. The vicarious phenomenological method,
which makes possible the study of other persons' experi-
ences, was not as established as it is today. Nevertheless,
some of Spiegelberg's insights are important to note because
of their pedagogical value. Retrospectively, he listed the pos-
itive outcomes of cooperative phenomenology: It catalyzes
new perspectives; it sobers less-critical participants into
clear communication; it "intersubjectivizes," allowing for
univocal results in spite of a subjective base; it enriches the
joint exploration, formulation, and reformulation of the
essences of a phenomenon; and it attunes participants'aware-
ness of each other's insights (Spiegelberg, 1975, pp. 32-33).
He states that
6 SAGE Open
one of the most meaningful and revealing occurrences may be
when one of the partners suddenly exclaims "aha" in a tone of
voice indicating that he has not only just become aware of
something new but also realizes that he has discovered what the
other partner meant all along. (Spiegelberg, 1975, p. 33)
Such outcomes of group dwelling on a phenomenon are
important contributions to any curriculum, including the cur-
riculum we have described above. However, the strength of
Spiegelberg's workshops may also have been their weak-
ness: Their focus on the process of doing "joint phenomenol-
ogizing" came with the price of a reduced focus on core
existential phenomena such as death, freedom, control, and,
most relevant here, health.
In the context of health care, the use of phenomenology in
higher education is discussed in Teaching the Practitioners
of Care (Diekelmann, 2003). Dahlberg et al.'s (2003) article
in this anthology compares so-called "narrative pedagogy,"
developed by Diekelmann in the United States, with life-
world pedagogy, developed by Ekebergh in Sweden. Both
ways of teaching were developed from research for nursing
education. They have in common an emphasis on openness,
which "means that teachers and students make themselves
receptive and sensitive to the phenomenon of interest as it
presents itself" (Dahlberg et al., 2003, p. 34). An important
phenomenon under study is the reciprocity between and
among teachers and students, with a special focus on the role
of the teacher. Dahlberg et al. emphasize that narratives,
whether oral or written stories, anecdotes or illustrations, can
capture challenging situations stemming from teaching prac-
tice in nursing. They extract from these narratives that teach-
ers have a special responsibility to be sensitive to the
student's learning process. The application of phenomenol-
ogy in these approaches thus seems to direct attention to nar-
ratives concerning the learning experience itself in higher
health care education.
The emphasis in our own program is on first-person expe-
riences with mental health that come from the student's per-
sonal or professional life. That emphasis is possible because
we are privileged to work with adult students who all have
such significant experiences. Naturally, our students are
challenged by our request--presented on their first day in the
program--to capitalize on these experiences and at the same
time shortcut their reflex action of judging the clinical situa-
tion, which has often been painstakingly acquired in the
field. The impact that our approach may have on students is
made explicit by narrative and lifeworld phenomenological
pedagogy as described above: We are aware of our responsi-
bility as teachers carefully to balance the request for suspen-
sion of judgment (openness) with practice-directed reflection
on the phenomenon under scrutiny (closure). A postmodern
"Open 24/7," as a celebration of differences or an opposition
to traditional power relations (cf. Burbules & Rice, 1991), is
not an option for the higher education of professionals in the
mental health field, as neither care worker nor client has such
an option at hand at all times in real life beyond university
college (cf. Giorgi, 2000).
How then to achieve closure? When adopting the phe-
nomenological attitude, students are submerged in the
description of a phenomenon. But they must surface as well:
"It doesn't suffice that you unfold an experience. . . . The
scientific act is to take responsibility to `milk' the descrip-
tion, `dig' for its meaning, reflectively analyze, synthesize,
or interpret the descriptions" (Alapack, 2000, p. 7; italics in
original). We understand reflection on phenomenological
descriptions as getting to know better what we know and
what we do not know.
Kegan (1982, 1994) conceptualizes what is at stake in the
simplest of terms: What is subject must become object.
Piaget's conceptual pair of assimilation and accommodation
forms the inspiration of his approach (Lahey, Souvaine,
Kegan, Goodman, & Felix, 1988). It addresses how people
structure meaning in their world and how this structuring
may change throughout life. Kegan distinguishes different
qualitative levels of complexity in meaning making; we are
at any point in our life subject to (embedded in) one level of
complexity, and we can make object (emerge from) a lower
level of complexity. For instance, we can be subject to the
ideology that shapes our experience of self, which is firmly
fenced off from another person's different ideology of self;
here, we do not easily open up to "negotiation" because we
do not have the metaview of our ideology that is required.
But then, we can take as object the way another person's
feelings and emotions influence our own, always letting our
sense of self guide these feelings and emotions.
We have object; we are subject. We cannot be responsible for,
or in control of, or reflect upon what is subject. . . . "Object"
refers to those elements of our knowing or organization that we
can reflect on, handle, look at, be responsible for. (Kegan, 1994,
p. 32)
The transformation from subject to object is often gradual
and comes in discernible intermediate stages: We get to
know what we do not know slowly, only step-by-step adjust-
ing our overall way of making meaning to new situation-
bound insights.
Kegan's (1994) main point in In Over Our Heads: The
Mental Demands of Modern Life is that society has defined
curricula for parenting, partnering, conflict resolution, adult
education, and other arenas of life that demand a complexity
of mind that may be of a higher level than a large proportion
of the population has reached so far. In our curriculum, we
deliberately use the alternation of complexities as a catalyst
for learning. As described in the six phases above, we repeti-
tively create and help dissolve the students' sense of being
"in over their heads." Reflection is imperative if one is to
learn; it is a structural property of the learning process. But
the content of the reflection is inherent in the content of the
description, which is different in each phase described above.
Bongaardt et al. 7
Therefore, we give students a choice about how they sub-
stantiate their reflections--we cannot prescribe what only
they can account for (see Phases 2, 4, 5, and 6). In our cur-
riculum, students may experience closure every time subject
becomes object, but all the while, they are creating new sub-
ject matter to start pondering. Hence, we speak of a repeated
alternation of description and reflection.
Conclusion
We argue for the primacy of simplifying complexity in the
higher education of mental health workers by appropriating
descriptive phenomenology. Such simplification derives in the
first instance from a curriculum decreed by the Norwegian gov-
ernment and in the second instance from a "self-simplification"
based on the students'own experiences with life and work (cf.
Pattee, 1972). While a conventional pedagogy may emphasize
what students should be informed about, we focus on how stu-
dents can transform their way of making meaning in their
actions and reflections (Kegan, 1994; Kreber, 2001).
Phenomenological pedagogy avoids traditional compartmen-
talization of the field. It rather profits from the field's com-
plexity by treating it as a rich source of knowledge. The adult
student's personal­professionally experienced sense of rele-
vance forms the starting point for navigating the field with the
purpose to contextualize experiences and deepen understand-
ing. This promotes a work practice that integrates personal,
relational, and research sources of knowledge, and endorses
the interdisciplinary nature of the field. Ours is a way of teach-
ing that relies on adult students being grounded in their profes-
sional identity yet willing to float freely during periods of life.
The clients they work with, who may have been floating freely
in life longer than desired, demand and deserve that.
