Background Prenatal cocaine exposure is a marker of developmental risk. Social environmental
risk factors may include maternal stress and maternal perceptions of difficult infant
temperament. Objectives To examine factors that may predict or moderate maternal ratings
of parenting stress and difficult temperament in cocaine-exposed (CE) infants. Method
Neonatal behavior, infant temperament, parenting stress, and maternal psychopathology were
measured in a large sample of infant­mother dyads with prenatal CE and a nonexposed com-
parison sample. Participants were drawn from an existing longitudinal data set (Maternal
Lifestyle Study). Result Relations between neonatal behavior and infant temperament rat-
ings were moderated by mothers' ratings of parenting stress. Relations between neonatal cry and
parenting stress were moderated by maternal psychopathology ratings. Results were unrelated
to drug exposure history. Conclusions For mothers of at risk infants (with or without
prenatal CE), psychological distress affects the degree to which infant behavioral characteristics
are experienced as stressful or difficult. Implications for treatment and outcome are discussed.
Key words cocaine; parenting stress; temperament.
Prenatal exposure to cocaine is a marker of developmental
risk. Disruptions in the infant­parent dyad are an
important component of this risk status (Beeghly &
Tronick, 1994; Tronick & Beeghly, 1999). However,
because prenatal exposure and maternal substance
abuse is a marker--and not a determinant--of risk, a
range of social, environmental, and biological factors
will moderate developmental outcomes in this popula-
tion. Therefore, an important goal for research is to
identify factors that may either magnify or attenuate risk
in cocaine-exposed (CE) infants. Two dyadic factors that
are likely to mark a heightened risk for this vulnerable
population are the degree to which mothers perceive
their parental role as highly stressful and the degree to
which they perceive their infant as temperamentally dif-
ficult. The goal of this study was to understand pro-
cesses that may heighten or attenuate the levels of
parenting stress and perceptions of infant temperament
in a sample of infants exposed prenatally to cocaine.
High levels of maternal stress have been found to
relate to poor behavioral outcomes in young children
(Creasey & Jarvis, 1994; Goldberg et.al., 1997). In addi-
tion, maternal ratings of infant temperament have been
found to predict maternal behaviors (Milliones, 1978)
and child behavioral outcomes (Sanson, Oberklaid,
Pedlow, & Prior, 1991). Understanding the potential

sources of parenting stress and maternal perceptions of
temperament will enhance our understanding of the
psychosocial factors associated with child and dyadic
functioning in at-risk populations. For infants with pre-
natal cocaine exposure, an understanding of relations
between these dyadic factors will help to identify dyads
at highest risk for subsequent developmental difficulties.
Identifying moderators of risk will help to better tar-
get prevention and treatment efforts for those infants at
highest risk and for those developmental and dyadic
domains of functioning that operate most strongly on
developmental and mental health outcomes. For this
research, we examined the role of maternal characteris-
tics such as maternal substance abuse history and mater-
nal psychopathology as potential moderators of
longitudinal relations between neonatal behavioral char-
acteristics and parenting stress. We were interested in
ratings of parenting stress as an important outcome in
and of itself. However, it was also recognized that the
degree of stress that a mother experiences may also
impact her perception of and reactions to her infant.
Thus, we also investigated whether parenting stress
would prove to moderate relations between neonatal
behavior and later maternal ratings of temperament.
We assumed that there is some consistency of infant
characteristics over the course of the first 4­6 months of
life. Stable individual differences in infant temperament
ratings have been demonstrated when infant behavioral
characteristics are measured objectively and with an
emphasis on such phenomena as irritability and reactiv-
ity (e.g., Korner, 1996; Riese, 1987). Research has also
documented the stability of behavior and temperament
for infants who presented with extremes of such behav-
ioral tendencies or where there are other objective indi-
ces of risk (Anderson et.al., 1989; Worobey & Lewis,
1989). Thus, studies indicate that neonatal characteris-
tics such as irritability and reactivity may have predictive
validity when measured at their extremes, or for infants
who may be otherwise at risk for developmental prob-
lems. Though there is some evidence for stability in tem-
perament ratings in cocaine-exposed infants (Smith,
1999), there are likely to be individual and contextual
influences on the degree of stability of temperament in
infancy (Wachs & Kohnstamm, 2001). CE infants may
not show the same degree of stability in temperament
seen in nonexposed populations. Thus, it will be impor-
tant to understand whether relations between and within
behavioral domains are affected by prenatal drug expo-
sure or other characteristics of the infant­parent dyad.
CE infants have previously been found to display
atypical patterns on measures of neonatal regulation and
reactivity (DiPietro, Suess, Wheeler, Smouse, & Newlin,
1995; Lester et.al., 2002). These findings have implica-
tions for the study reported here. Because at least a subset
of CE neonates show a heightened pattern of reactivity,
there may be an increased likelihood that these infants
will be perceived as more difficult by caregivers and that
this may also relate to the degree of stress that a care-
giver experiences as a parent. However, it can be
assumed that relations between infant temperament and
maternal attitudes and behavior are bidirectional, with
infant temperament and parental attitudes having recip-
rocal effects over time (Wachs & Kohnstamm, 2001).
An additional assumption of this study was that par-
ent ratings of infant temperament are the product not
just of infant behavior but also of parental perceptions of
these behaviors (Bates, 1980). Certain behaviors, such
as persistent infant crying, may be experienced as partic-
ularly stressful (Papousek & von Hofacker, 1998). How-
ever, parents vary in the degree to which they find infant
behaviors stressful. For instance, Pedersen, Huffman,
del Carmen, and Bryan (1996) found that pregnant
women who rated recordings of unfamiliar infant cries
as aversive were more likely to subsequently (i.e., 3
months postnatal) rate their own infant's temperament
as fussy and difficult. These mothers also varied in their
cardiac reactivity to infant cries. In other words,
although objective differences in cry may be generally
experienced as more or less stressful, parents differ in
their reactivity and potential susceptibility to stressful
infant behaviors. Research also indicates that perceived
infant characteristics interact with caregiver psychopa-
thology to predict later parental perceptions of infants as
more or less stressful (Gefland, Teti, & Fox, 1992).
Such effects have not been studied specifically in
cocaine- or drug-exposed populations. However, factors
that affect whether infants are likely to be viewed as dif-
ficult and stressful may be particularly salient in drug-
using populations. Mothers who have used cocaine or
other drugs during pregnancy appear more likely than
nondrug-using mothers to have comorbid psychiatric
diagnoses and to have experienced past traumatic events
(Hans, 1999). In addition, there is some evidence that as
a group, mothers with a history of substance abuse expe-
rience greater levels of parenting-related stress (Kelley,
1992). The presence of psychiatric symptoms, whether
for parents with or without substance abuse histories,
may result in or reflect diminished personal coping
resources, thereby making it more difficult for them to
respond adaptively to the stressors of parenting.
This study examines the relations between neonatal
behavior and later measures of parenting stress and

parental perception of temperament at 4 months of age
in a sample of children with prenatal cocaine exposure
and their caregivers, and a comparison sample of non-
CE infants. The sample was drawn from a longitudinal
study of prenatal drug exposure, the Maternal Lifestyle
Study (Lester, 1998). The evidence reviewed above sug-
gests that neonatal and parent characteristics may have
interactive effects on later parenting stress and percep-
tion of temperament. However, there has been little
research that has specifically addressed these issues in
CE infants. The central question to be addressed in this
study was whether parental characteristics, such as
maternal substance abuse history, parenting stress, and
psychopathology, would modify relations between
objective measures of neonatal behaviors and later
maternal ratings of infant temperament. Also, we tested
whether maternal drug use and psychopathology inter-
acted with neonatal behavioral characteristics to explain
individual differences in parenting related stress in early
infancy. To answer these questions, the linear relations
between neonatal behavior and later measures of parenting
stress and maternal perception of infant temperament
were also examined.
Methods
Subjects
Participants were drawn from the Maternal Lifestyle
Study (MLS), an investigation of the effects of prenatal
cocaine or opiate exposure on child outcome in a longi-
tudinal follow-up from 1 month to 11 years in 1,388
children divided into an exposed group and a compari-
son group (Lester, 1998). Infants were entered into the
"exposed" group if there was either maternal report of
cocaine or opiate use during the pregnancy based on
hospital interview or positive meconium assay (positive
enzyme multiple immunoassay (EMIT) screen followed
by positive gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy).
Infants were entered into the comparison group if there
was maternal denial of cocaine or opiate use and a nega-
tive EMIT screen for cocaine and opiate metabolites.
Groups were matched on prematurity, race, and sex.
Infants were excluded from the MLS if they had a chro-
mosomal abnormality or TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other
agents, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes) infection con-
firmed before the 1-month assessment or if the mother
planned to move outside of the study catchment area.
Additional information on the severity of prenatal
cocaine exposure was determined by interview with
mothers at 1-month corrected age using the Maternal
Inventory of Substance Use (MISU; Shankaran et.al.,
1996). Dyads were classified into three groups: no pre-
natal exposure, some exposure, and heavy exposure
(defined as reported cocaine use of 3 days per week
during the first trimester; see Lester et.al., 2002).
MLS is conducted under the auspices of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment (NICHD), Neonatal Research Network at Brown
University, University of Miami, University of Tennessee,
Memphis, and Wayne State University. MLS was given a
"certificate of confidentiality" from the United States
Department of Health and Human Services, which allowed
the study to maintain participant confidentiality with
regard to drug-use information. The certificate of confiden-
tiality applied specifically to information regarding mater-
nal use of drugs and left in force all reporting requirements
with regard to suspicion of child abuse or child neglect.
Participants were fully informed of their rights and limits
as study participants, including limits to confidentiality,
and informed consent was obtained from all caregivers, as
approved by review boards at each study site.
For this article, children were selected from the
MLS if they were in the care of their biological mother
(regardless of drug exposure grouping). This resulted in
a subsample of 984 children with data on measures of
neonatal behavior and 4-month measures of maternal
psychopathology, parenting stress, and temperament
ratings. We included only biologically related dyads
because we were interested in the phenomenon of pre-
natal cocaine exposure as related to both the infant
exposed to the drug and the mother who had used
cocaine during pregnancy. Because of differential rates
of foster placements, infants who were excluded (n = 404)
were more likely to have been in the CE group than
those who were retained for this study (65% vs. 40%, 2
(1, n-1388) = 73.56, p < .001). Sample size for each anal-
ysis reported in this article varied slightly because of
missing data. Unless otherwise noted, the children
excluded from specific analyses did not differ from those
included (e.g., in birth weight, race, sex, and exposure
status). All infant ages reported are corrected for obstet-
ric estimate of gestational age at birth.
Measures
Neonatal Behavior
Neonatal measures were chosen to represent objective
measures of individual differences in neonatal reactivity.
Infants were assessed at 1-month corrected age with the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)-Network Neuro-
behavioral Scales (NNNS; Lester & Tronick, 1994) and an
acoustic analysis of infant cry. The NNNS and cry mea-
sures were aggregated into two cumulative indices, each
30 Sheinkopf et al.
representing the degree to which infants were highly
reactive to the procedures. A summary of these measures is
below, followed by a detailed description of the aggregation
process and scale development.
The NNNS was developed by the NICHD NICU
Network for use in MLS and has been used previously in
a study of CE newborn infants (Napiorkowski et al.,
1996). The NNNS is a semistructured and comprehensive
examination of neurological integrity and behavioral
function in the newborn. Methods and items were
adapted from the Brazelton examination and also
include an assessment of stress signs that can be
observed over the course of the NNNS administration.
The NNNS includes 45 items administered in packages
of items. In addition, there are 21 summary items that
are intended to reflect overall functioning during the
examination. A rating of the presence or absence of 50
stress signs, grouped into 7 categories, is also made by
the examiner.
For the cry analyses, a cry-eliciting stimulus was
administered to the infant's foot, and cries were subse-
quently analyzed off-line by a computer system designed
for this purpose (Cry Research, Inc., Brookline, MA) and
used previously in studies of drug-exposed infants (Corwin
et.al., 1992; Lester et.al., 1991). Cry was analyzed for
latency to cry, number and length of utterances, and a
number of acoustic features.
The NNNS and cry measures were used in this
study as objective measures of neonatal reactivity. A
cumulative index approach was used to aggregate vari-
ables from these procedures into composite measures of
neonatal reactivity. Each item from the NNNS and the
Cry analysis was dichotomized so as to reflect extreme
responding or scores. Dichotomization was on an item-
by-item level, with dichotomized items being summed
to create two continuous variables, one for the NNNS
procedure and one for cry measure. Final items included
in the NNNS and cry aggregate measures, as well as a
description of these items, are presented in Appendices
A and B, along with estimates of internal consistency.
For each item on the NNNS, children whose item
score was in the upper or lower (depending the direc-
tion of scoring) quintile of respondents received a code
of "1" to indicate an extreme score. Nonextreme
responders received a code of "0". This upper or lower
quintile rule was altered for some items to ensure that
only clinically meaningful scores were coded as
extreme (e.g., where the original cut point would have
resulted in the assignment of a score of "1" to behav-
iors that would be considered normative based on
guidelines in the NNNS scoring manual). The final set
of items was determined through an a priori, iterative
process of selecting those items that on face value
reflected high temperamental reactivity, and then
excluding the remaining variables that reduced the
internal consistency of the scale. The resulting scale
included 38 items from the NNNS ( = .72). The
potential range for the cumulative NNNS risk score
was 0­38. Items with missing data received a score of
0. Only children with scores on 75% of NNNS items
were included in the analyses.
Cry variables were dichotomized in a similar manner
to the NNNS variables so as to identify children most
highly reactive to the eliciting stimulus. Cry variables
were dropped from the final scale if they reduced inter-
nal consistency. The resulting scale included 12 items
( = .59). For each item a child could receive a score of
either 1 (risk) or 0 (no risk). The resulting aggregate
measure had a potential range of 0­12. Thus, cry cumu-
lative index scores reflect extremes in the duration and
intensity of the cry response.
4-Month Outcome Variables
Caregivers were administered a series of self-report
questionnaires when infants were 4-months corrected
age. Because of variations in reading competency in the
MLS sample, these questionnaires were read to all moth-
ers. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI; Desrogatis,
1993) was administered as measure of maternal psycho-
pathology. The total score (Global Severity Index) was
used in this study. The Parenting Stress Inventory (PSI;
Abidin, 1983) was used to assess the degree of parenting
stress experienced by caregivers. The shortened 36-item
version of the PSI was used. The PSI yields a total score
and 3 factor scores (Parental Distress, Parent­Child
Dysfunctional Interaction, and Difficult Child). A sum
of the Parental Distress and Parent­Child Dysfunctional
Interaction scores were used for the this study to avoid
confounding the measure of parenting stress with rat-
ings of infant temperament. Finally, a modified version
of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire (IBQ; Rothbart,
1981) was administered as a measure parent-reported
child temperament (modifications, approved by M. K.
Rothbart, included simplification of language for the
MLS population and reduction of response scale to five
points). The IBQ yields six summary scales: Activity
Level, Smiling and Laughter, Distress to Novelty, Distress
to Limitations, Soothability, and Duration of Orienting.
The Distress to Novelty and Distress to Limitations
scales were used for this study. These scales were chosen
because of our interest in examining relations between
reactivity at the two age points.

Results
Results are presented in three sections. First, descriptive
statistics will be presented for the 1- and 4-month mea-
sures, including both child and maternal variables. Sec-
ond, correlation analyses of relations amongst study
variables will be presented. And third, a series of hierar-
chical regression analyses are presented as a test of the
main question posed by this study: whether child and
parent variables would interact in their prediction of
parenting stress and temperament ratings. We note here
that there were a small number of dyads in the CE group
who also had prenatal opiate exposure (36 of 394; 9% of
the CE sample included in these analyses). The analyses
reported below were run with and without these 36
dyads, and exclusion of these children did not signifi-
cantly affect the results. Thus, because the interest in
this article was to examine relations between maternal
and infant characteristics in the first 4 months of life, we
retained the data for these dyads and will refer to the
two groups as CE and nonexposed.
Preliminary Analyses
Children in the exposed group were lower in SES (socio-
economic status) than those in the nonexposed group
(see Table I). The analysis with the 3-group exposure
severity score also revealed a significant effect of prena-
tal cocaine exposure on SES scores, F(2,957) = 6.97, p =
.001. Nonexposed dyads were higher in SES than dyads
in the "heavy" exposure group (p = .001), but the light
exposure group did not differ from either the nonex-
posed or heavy exposure groups. Exposed dyads did not
differ from nonexposed on PSI scores. However, when
tested with the three group severity variable a group
difference in PSI scores did emerge F(2, 942) = 7.71,
p < .001. Multiple comparisons indicated that the non-
exposed dyads had lower PSI scores than both the light
exposure group (p = .01) and the heavy exposure group
(p = .001). Otherwise, there were no other significant
differences between exposed and nonexposed children on
the study variables. The PSI total scores were distributed
in a similar manner to the norms for this measure. Across
cohorts, 53% scored above the median, and 24% scored
above the 80th percentile on this measure. However,
28% of the overall sample scored above clinical cutoff on
the total score of the BSI (32% for the CE group, 26% for
the nonexposed group; 2 (1,984) = 4.75, p = .03).
It should be noted that this study required the
selection of biologic mothers. Infants from excluded
dyads (i.e., in foster care) received lower ratings on the
IBQ Distress to Limitations scale, were slightly lower in
birth weight (2434 g vs. 2647 g), and received margin-
ally higher scores on the NNNS cumulative score. Care-
givers of excluded dyads had lower scores on the PSI
and BSI.
Correlation Analyses
Correlation analyses examining the relations amongst
study variables are presented in Table II. SES correlated
significantly with five of the six measures (two neonatal
measures and four measures at 4-months of age). Lower
SES was related to greater neonatal reactivity, higher rat-
ings of distress to novelty and limits, and higher parent-
ing stress and psychological distress in mothers. NNNS
scores were significantly and positively related to 4-
month Distress to Limits scores, whereas Cry scores

measure to nonnuclear families. The scale retains the traditionally weighted educational and occupational scale scores.

were positively related to Distress to Novelty scores.
Neither the NNNS nor the Cry scores were correlated
with maternal ratings of parenting stress or psychopa-
thology.
Amongst 4-month measures, consistent correlations
were observed between scores on the IBQ scales, PSI,
and BSI scores. Higher parenting stress was related to
higher maternal ratings of infants' distress to novelty
and limitations. Maternal ratings of infant distress to
novelty and distress to limitations were both positively
correlated with maternal psychological distress, as mea-
sured by the BSI. The IBQ Distress to Limitations scores
correlated at above .25 for both PSI and BSI scores. In
addition, the measure of parenting stress (PSI) and mater-
nal psychopathology (BSI) were moderately correlated.
Regression Analyses
A series of hierarchical regression analyses were per-
formed to test whether the influence of early infant
behavioral characteristics on later parenting stress and
temperament ratings would vary depending on factors in
the infant­parent dyad. In each regression model, drug
exposure, SES, child gender, and MLS study site were
entered at step 1 (study site was entered because it was a
common finding that infants differed on a variety of
MLS variables across study site). Neonatal Cry and
NNNS scores were entered at the second step to model
the main effect of neonatal behavior on later maternal
and temperament measures. The main effects of the
maternal ratings were entered at step 3. The interaction
terms relevant for each hypothesis were entered at the
fourth step in each model. For the models testing the
interactions between maternal drug abuse (infant expo-
sure status) and neonatal behavioral measures, variables
were entered in three steps, with the interaction terms
entered at the final step in the model. For these analyses,
two sets of regressions were performed, one using the
two-group exposure variable and one using the three-
group exposure severity measure.
Parenting Stress Ratings
Maternal psychopathology ratings explained a signifi-
cant amount of variance in parenting stress (PSI scores)
after controlling for child gender, exposure status, and
neonatal behavior (see Table III). There was some evi-
dence for an effect of exposure status (i.e., maternal
cocaine or opiate use during pregnancy) on parenting
stress, although this effect was not significant after con-
trolling for maternal psychopathology (BSI scores). SES
scores explained a significant amount of variance in later
PSI scores, with lower SES being associated with higher
scores on the PSI. There was a significant interaction
between BSI scores and the Cry index in predicting
parenting stress ( = .111, p < .05). We examined
regression slopes within BSI quartile ranges. This analy-
sis indicated that the relation between neonatal cry and

later parenting stress was somewhat stronger for dyads
where the mother was experiencing greater degrees of
psychological distress. However, the relations between
Cry and PSI scores were not significant within these
subgroups of BSI scores, even for the upper quartile.
Additional analyses were performed by splitting the BSI
sample by criteria defined in the BSI manual, which
defines a case in two different ways: (a) individuals with
scores above the 90th percentile of the normative distri-
bution on the GSI and (b) individuals with elevations on
two or more BSI subscales. We split the sample in these
two ways and examined regression slopes and correla-
tions between the Cry and PSI scores. The resulting
regression coefficients were not significantly different
than 0.
A separate analysis was performed to test the effect of
the cocaine exposure-by­neonatal behavior interaction
on later PSI scores. The interaction between prenatal CE
and neonatal behavior was not a significant predictor of
maternal self-reported parenting stress on the PSI. This
was true for models using the two-group exposure status
variable and the three-group exposure severity variable.
Temperament Ratings
The second hypothesis for this study was whether neo-
natal reactivity (rated from the NNNS and Cry scales)
would predict later maternal ratings of infant tempera-
ment, and whether parenting stress and psychopathol-
ogy would moderate such relations. The Distress to
Limitations scale from the IBQ was chosen as the depen-
dent measure of temperament because of its conceptual
similarity to the measures of neonatal reactivity
employed in this study. Results are presented in Table IV.
NNNS, parenting stress, and parent psychopathology
self-report scores each showed significant unique rela-
tions to IBQ ratings after controlling for effects of gen-
der, SES, and study site. Thus, children who showed
more reactivity on the NNNS and whose mothers
reported more parenting related stress and psychological
distress were rated as being higher in distress to limita-
tions at 4 months of age.
In addition to these main effects, there was a signifi-
cant interaction between parenting-stress and neonatal
reactivity on the NNNS in predicting maternal ratings of
infants' distress to limitations. We investigated this
interaction between PSI and NNNS scores by examining
the relation between NNNS scores and IBQ Distress to
Limitations ratings within quartile ranges of the PSI dis-
tribution. These analyses indicated that this relation was
stronger in dyads where mothers reported higher
parenting-related stress, specifically for dyads with PSI
scores in the upper two quartiles of the distribution.
Separate regression analyses for the dyads above and
below the PSI median were run. Covariates were entered
at the first step (gender, exposure, SES, and study site),
and the NNNS variable was entered at the second step.
NNNS scores did not add significantly to the model for
low PSI dyads. In fact, the overall model for this sub-
group was nonsignifican, Model: R2 = 0.009, F(4, 467) < 1.
For the high PSI subgroup, NNNS scores showed a
significant unique relation with IBQ scores after control-

the NNNS scale. This analysis indicated that the relation
between PSI and IBQ scores were of similar magnitude
(and in the same direction) for both children with high
and low NNNS reactivity scale scores. Overall, these
analyses indicate that reactivity at 1 month as measured
by the NNNS is predictive of IBQ Distress to Limitations
ratings at 4 months, but that this relation is moderated
by the degree of parenting related stress experienced by
mothers.
A separate analysis was performed to test the effect
of the cocaine exposure-by­neonatal behavior interac-
tion on the maternal ratings of infant temperament. As
with the analysis of parenting stress ratings, the interac-
tion between prenatal CE and neonatal behavior was not
a significant predictor of mothers' rating of the IBQ Dis-
tress to Limitation scale. Again, no exposure by neonatal
behavior interaction was found for either the two-group
exposure variable or the three-group exposure severity
variable.
It is possible that the observed interaction between
PSI and NNNS scores in predicting 4-month distress to
limitations reflected dyads where infants were most con-
sistently reactive during the first 4 months of life. As
reported above, we did observe some modest stability of
individual differences in reactivity from 1 to 4 months of
age (i.e., there was a significant relation between NNNS
scores and 4-month distress to limitations ratings).
However, the interaction between NNNS and IBQ Dis-
tress to Limitations scores in explaining variance in PSI
scores at 4 months was nonsignificant. This was tested
by regressing NNNS scores, IBQ scores, and the NNNS­
IBQ interaction on 4-month PSI scores. As with the
other regression models, gender, exposure status, SES,
and site were entered at an initial step in the model. The
overall model was significant, Model: R2 = 0.13, F (7,
931) = 20.50, p < 0.001. IBQ Distress to Limits scores
added significantly to the model, R2 = .063, p < .001.
Neither NNNS scores nor the NNNS­IBQ interaction
added significantly to the model.
Discussion
The results of this study revealed that in two cohorts of
infant­mother dyads, one with prenatal cocaine or opiate
exposure and a nonexposed control sample, neonatal
behavioral characteristics and certain maternal psycho-
logical characteristics interacted to predict maternal rat-
ings of temperament, and maternal self-reports of
parenting stress. Specifically, an accumulation of behav-
ioral signs of extreme neonatal reactivity on a behavioral
examination (the NNNS) predicted higher maternal rat-
ings of infant reactivity (IBQ Distress to Limitations) at 4-
months corrected age, though primarily for dyads where
the mother was experiencing more stress related to
parenting. There was some indication that extreme char-
acteristics of neonatal cry interacted with maternal psy-
chopathology in predicting self-reported parenting stress
3 months later. However, maternal psychopathology was
otherwise unrelated to earlier measures of neonatal cry
and behavior. Thus, maternal characteristics (stress and
psychopathology) interacted with neonatal reactivity to
explain variability in later maternal ratings of parenting
stress and maternal ratings of infant temperament. These
interactive effects were most evident in accounting for
variance in mothers' temperament ratings at 4 months.
These results were not affected by mothers' sub-
stance abuse history. Substance use or exposure group-
ings did not differ on study variables. In addition,
substance use or exposure did not interact with neonatal
behavior to predict 4-month outcome measures. These
findings do not support the prediction that maternal
substance abuse history would moderate the ways in
which mothers perceived their infants. Rather, these
findings suggest that the degree to which neonatal reactivity

explains variation in later maternal ratings of infant tem-
perament is dependent on the general level of parenting
stress experienced by mothers, regardless of whether they
had used cocaine and/or opiates during pregnancy.
Prior research has indicated that parental ratings of
infant temperament are influenced both by variation in
objectively measured infant behavior patterns and by
antecedent parental behavior patterns (Anderson et.al.,
1989; Crockenberg & Acredolo, 1983). This study did
not compare parental perception of temperament to
objective indices of infant behavior measured at the
same time. However, we did observe a small but signifi-
cant relation between 1-month observations and 4-
month ratings of infant reactivity. In so far as parent rat-
ings reflect both objective and perceived individual dif-
ferences in infant behavior, this can be interpreted as
showing only a modest level of stability in early infant
behavior, at least within the domain of reactivity. We
did not find evidence that levels of parenting stress
depended on the degree of stability in high infant reac-
tivity, although alternate study designs would be able to
address this question more directly. Thus, although not
the only possible interpretation, the results reported
here are at least consistent with the view that parents
vary in how they react to and experience the early
behavioral characteristics of their infants (e.g., Wachs &
Kohnstamm, 2001). The important finding here is that
these processes are at play in dyads with and without a
history of prenatal drug exposure and use.
The exclusionary criteria used in selecting dyads for
the analyses in this article may help to explain the null
findings for the main effects of prenatal drug exposure.
This leads us to be cautious when drawing conclusions
about the neurobehavioral functioning of CE infants on
the neonatal behavioral examination (the NNNS) and
the cry analyses. Subjects included in this study were
more extreme in their neonatal cry and behavior than
those excluded from analyses (i.e., those included had
higher scores on the NNNS and Cry cumulative mea-
sures). Furthermore, those excluded from analyses were
more likely to have been exposed to cocaine and opiates
during pregnancy. These differences suggest that the
results reported here should not form the basis for con-
clusions about drug exposure effects on the early behav-
ioral presentation of drug-exposed infants. Rather, these
results suggest that, regardless of exposure status, the
manner in which caregivers react to and cope with chal-
lenging infant behaviors can be expected to affect infant
development.
Neither objective neonatal cry nor neonatal behav-
ior was directly related to later parenting stress and
maternal psychopathology. The study design and nature
of the measures used may have limited the possibility of
observing such relations. If neonatal cry and behavior
had been measured differently, for instance, so as to
sample extremes in the duration of cry or other behav-
iors over time, we may indeed have found such relations
(see Papousek & von Hofacker, 1998). In addition,
objective measures of child behavior and parental stress
may be more tightly related when these domains are
assessed concurrently.
In addition, we observed only modest relations
between behavioral measures in neonatal period and
temperament measured at 4 months of age. Aspects of
our measurement may have attenuated relations
between the 1- and 4-month measures. Past findings of
stability of individual differences in infant tempera-
ment across time have used behavioral observations
(vs. parent report) at both time points (e.g., Riese,
1987), whereas this study utilized behavior observa-
tion at time 1 and parent ratings at time 2. In addition,
it should be noted that the internal consistency of the
cry scale used in this study was somewhat low. This
reflects measurement error that limits the magnitude of
relations that could be observed between cry and other
variables.
But beyond these measurement and methodological
factors, the small (though significant) relations between
1- and 4-month reactivity scores (i.e., 1-month NNNS
scores and 4-month IBQ Distress to Limitations ratings)
suggests that there was variability in the degree to which
infants displayed stable characteristics in the domain of
early reactivity. The interaction between NNNS and PSI
scores in predicting 4-month temperament ratings is
consistent with differential stability in early tempera-
ment ratings (resulting in higher parenting stress for
those with high 1- and 4-month reactivity ratings), but
is also consistent with differential parent perceptions of
infant behavioral tendencies. As argued above, our data
are suggestive of the latter of these two possibilities, but
these results are not definitive in this regard.
Clearly there are several alternative, though not
mutually exclusive, scenarios that may explain the inter-
actions observed in this study. First, the moderating
effect of parenting stress on the relation between objec-
tive measures of neonatal behavior and later subjective
maternal ratings of infant temperament may be driven
by a subset of children who evidence persistent irritable
and difficult behaviors over the first 4 months of life. We
could not test this mechanism because objective mea-
sures of infant behavior at 4-months of age were not
available. However, there is prior evidence for stability
36 Sheinkopf et al.
in temperamental reactivity in the neonatal period and
early infancy (Korner, 1996; Worobey & Lewis, 1989).
Second, highly reactive neonates may elicit care-
giver behaviors that may either potentiate or moderate
these initial qualities. Highly stressed mothers may be
less able to respond to infants' difficult behaviors in a
positive or sensitive manner. Their subsequent ratings of
difficult temperament may be an accurate view of their
infant's temperamental qualities, even if these qualities
were in part shaped by earlier parental behavior (see
Crockenberg & Acredolo, 1983). Maternal psychopa-
thology or parenting stress may also serve to alter the
manner in which parents respond to infants. This effect
may in part operate on the salience that mothers attach
to infant behaviors, such as distress signs, although
some recent research suggests that this effect may differ
in direction (i.e., increased or decreased salience)
depending on maternal diagnosis (e.g., Schuetze &
Zeskind, 2001). This interpretation may be highly rele-
vant to the relation between 1-month reactivity and 4-
month distress to limitations ratings. The behavioral
index of reactivity derived from the NNNS reflects per-
haps a more subtle flavor of difficult or challenging
behaviors than would be reflected in, for example,
extreme and persistent cries. Thus, the behavioral ten-
dencies reflected in the NNNS measure may not be seen
as universally aversive, but rather may elicit different
parental reactions depending on the degree of parenting
stress experienced by a mother.
Third, parents who rate their children as difficult at
4 months of age may be partially accurate in their ratings
of infant temperament, although their general level of
parenting stress may result in exaggerated ratings of
their infants' temperamental qualities. Past research
showing that parental characteristics affect the percep-
tions of infant cries is consistent with this view (Crowe
& Zeskind, 1992; Pedersen et.al., 1996). This hypothe-
sis could be tested by examining discrepancies between
subjective (parental) and objective (laboratory) ratings
of infant behavior.
In conclusion, the results of this study can be
viewed at multiple levels. On one level, it may be that a
confluence of maternal and infant risk factors, in the
wider context of socioeconomic risks, may portend later
developmental and dyadic difficulties. On another level,
it may be that more specific patterns in the infant­parent
dyadic relationship will provide a glimpse into the
mechanisms for these broader risks. Such mechanisms
would conceivably include mismatches between objec-
tive measures and subjective ratings of infant cry and
behavior (Lester et.al., 1995; Pedersen et.al., 1996),
reactivity of mothers to infant cry and behavior (Crowe
& Zeskind, 1992; Pedersen et.al., 1996), and failures of
the dyad to manage developmental challenges (Beeghly
& Tronick, 1994). In this regard, evidence that there are
concurrent relations between parental perception of
infant irritability and parental responsiveness (Owens,
Shaw, & Vondra, 1998) points to one potential linkage
between caregiver experiences of neonatal difficult
behavior, parenting stress, and infant outcomes.
These conclusions should not be taken as a wholly
pessimistic view of the outcome of children with prena-
tal cocaine exposure. Recent evidence suggests that
intervention programs, including those that target both
children and caregivers, can have a positive effect on
child outcomes in this at-risk population (Claussen,
Scott, Mundy, & Katz, 2004). Although it is not yet clear
which types of interventions can reduce parenting stress
in dyads with prenatal cocaine exposure, the effect of
dyadic psychotherapies on parenting stress and paren-
tal attitudes has been documented in other popula-
tions (Cohen, Lojkasek, Muir, Muir, & Parker, 2002;
Feinfield & Baker, 2004). Recent evidence also suggests
that parenting stress and parenting attitudes may moder-
ate outcomes in at-risk drug-exposed populations
(Andra & Thomas, 1998; Schuler, Nair, & Black, 2002).
Clarifying child and parent characteristics that serve
to protect against the risks posed by prenatal drug expo-
sure is a critical goal for research. The degree of stress
experienced by mothers may impact reactions to infant
behaviors and the quality of the dyadic relationship. For
some dyads, this may serve to accentuate the risks asso-
ciated with prenatal drug exposure. However, by the
same token, for mothers experiencing less parenting
related stress, the effect may be to ameliorate risk factors
by altering in a positive fashion the perceptions of infant
behavioral characteristics and improving infant­parent
interactions. In other words, the degree of parenting
stress experienced by mothers of drug-exposed infants
may operate as both a risk and protective factor. To the
extent that parenting stress and attitudes can be modi-
fied, these factors are potentially important targets of
intervention.
