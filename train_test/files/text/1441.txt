Characterizing dietary consumption patterns is critical to dietary pesticide exposure assessment. We compared consumption patterns between adults (age
18­60) in the Metro Atlanta Cohort (MAC), a longitudinal study of pesticide exposure among Atlanta residents, and US National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) adults. We focused on foods commonly eaten by US adults and foods likely to contain certain pesticide residues. MAC
participants provided consumption data for 6 days per month for 1 year using a web-based data collection tool. We defined ``percent eaters'' as the
percent of participants who reported eating a particular food in 24 h. We computed the NHANES weighted percent eaters and 95% confidence limits
(CLs) using the 24-h dietary recall data. We calculated the MAC percent eaters for each sampling day and the percent of days this number fell below,
within, or above the NHANES 95% CLs. We also re-sampled the MAC percent eaters across sampling days to find whether the resulting distribution
resembled the NHANES estimate, and used the Kruskal­Wallis test to evaluate whether season affected the number of MAC eaters of a particular food
on a given sampling day. In general, across all sampling days, a greater proportion of MAC participants reported eating banana, broccoli, cream, grapes,
lettuce, onion, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string beans, and tomatoes than the national estimate, whereas the proportion of apple, spinach, catsup
and white bread/roll eaters was similar, and the proportion of milk drinkers was lower. Season predicted the number of MAC peach and strawberry eaters
but not other foods. The data show how a higher proportion of Atlanta adults may eat certain foods (e.g., peaches in summer or strawberries in spring)
than the national average depending on season or other factors. An exposure assessment that ignored this difference could underestimate dietary pesticide
intakes.

Introduction
Dietary intake has been identified as an important source of
non-occupational pesticide exposure among US adults,
particularly for organophosphorus (OP) and pyrethroid
pesticides (Dougherty et al., 2000; Buck et al., 2001; Meeker
et al., 2005; Riederer et al., 2008; Luo and Zhang, 2009;
MacIntosh et al., 1996, 2001a, b). Characterizing dietary
consumption patterns is an essential component of dietary
pesticide exposure and risk assessment (Food Quality
Protection Act of 1996) and typically involves empirical or
probabilistic descriptions of how individuals vary regarding
the types and amounts of foods they eat. Dietary pesticide
exposure assessments typically rely on national nutrition
surveys or similar large-scale studies for empirical data to
describe population-level variability in consumption habits.
In the United States, for example, the US Department of
Agriculture's (USDA) national Continuing Survey of Food
Intakes by Individuals (CSFII) is used as a source of
consumption data for quantitative assessments of risks from
acute (i.e., 1-day) dietary exposures to pesticides (US EPA,
1998, 2004, 2008). In 2002, the CSFII was incorporated into
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (CDC, 2002). CSFII/NHANES and similar
national surveys from other countries typically include
several days of dietary recall data collected from a national
probability sample.
Although most national surveys were not designed
explicitly for dietary contaminant exposure assessment, they
provide a useful initial source of information, especially given
the time and expense of collecting additional diet data. If
national data are used to estimate dietary pesticide intakes for
different subpopulations or seasons, however, care must be
taken to acknowledge and quantify the potential under-

estimation or overestimation of intakes that could result.
Most national consumption surveys provide limited or no
data needed to describe spatial or temporal variability in
dietary pesticide intakes. Instead, longitudinal studies are
needed to provide information on intraindividual and
seasonal variability, whereas regional studies are important
for providing information on spatial variability.
In this paper, we compare food consumption data from a
longitudinal study of adult dietary pesticide intake
we conducted in Metro Atlanta, Georgia, USA during
2006­2007 with public release data from the 2005­2006
NHANES. The objective of the comparison was to illustrate
differences in consumption patterns between the national,
cross-sectional data and a regional, longitudinal cohort. The
overall goal is to provide pesticide exposure and risk assessors
reliant on dietary data from national surveys with informa-
tion needed to conduct sensitivity analyses of food consump-
tion variables in their intake calculations.
Methods
Metro Atlanta Cohort (MAC) Study
The MAC Study was designed to collect longitudinal data on
dietary consumption patterns and to assess their influence on
dietary pesticide (OP and pyrethroid insecticides) exposures
of adult residents of three metropolitan Atlanta counties F
Fulton, DeKalb, and Gwinnett F during 2006­2007. We
contracted the AL Burruss Institute of Public Service at
Kennesaw State University (Kennesaw, GA, USA) to
establish a stratified probability sample of 500 individuals
in the three-county area, matching gender, age, and race/
ethnicity data for this area from the 2000 US Census through
random digit dialing. To reach a targeted enrollment of 60
participants, approximately 100 adults were contacted from
the 500-person sample. Of these, 66 adults agreed to attend
our training session, 53 adults completed the training
(described later) and signed the consent form, and 45
participants completed the sampling protocol. The protocol
included collection of 6 consecutive days (starting on
Sunday) of dietary consumption data, urine, and saliva in
each month over 1 calendar year. Participants chose 1 study
week per month at their convenience. The Emory University
IRB approved the use of human subjects in this study and
continued analysis of the data.
Participant training included an in-depth demonstration of
how to record dietary consumption data using the Internet
Data Logger (iDL) in an electronic personal data assistant
that we provided to each participant. Participants were also
given printed instructions for using both. The technical
design of the iDL was described in detail previously (Lu
et al., 2006). Briefly, the iDL is a web-based data collection
platform that allows participants to enter all food and
beverage items consumed during a meal or snack using a
food questionnaire that is hierarchically organized in a
branching format. For instance, if a participant ate a
sandwich, she/he was prompted to record each component
of the sandwich (e.g., bread, condiments, toppings, meats,
cheese) as a separate item in sequence. For each food entered,
the iDL requested the number of servings consumed as input.
An on-screen reference guide was provided listing the weight
or volume for one serving size of the food item.
The iDL's embedded features include a performance-
monitoring interface to improve participant compliance with
the longitudinal dietary data collection protocols. If a
participant forgot to enter a meal, the iDL posted a notice
at the next log-in reminding her/him to complete the meal
entry or verify that she/he did not eat it. Research staff
monitored participant meal entries daily. If no meals were
entered in 24 h or if an expected meal was not entered in 48 h,
a researcher called the participant to remind her/him to
complete the entries.
For the dietary comparisons presented in this paper, we
included data collected from 37 study participants. We
excluded two participants outside the 18­60 age range. We
also excluded two participants who had a baby during the
study based on the assumption that pregnant women would
have different food consumption patterns than non-pregnant
women. Finally, we excluded four participants who dropped
out of the study within the first 3 months for personal
reasons, such as relocating to outside the study area.
NHANES Dietary Data Collection
Demographic and dietary data collection methods are
available at the NHANES website (CDC, 2005a, 2006a).
All data used in this study were updated as of February 2009
(CDC, 2009a). Briefly, demographic data were collected
during the household sample person interview (CDC, 2005a).
Dietary data were collected in a 24-h recall interview where
respondents worked with trained interviewers using three-
dimensional measuring guides to record all foods/beverages
consumed from midnight to midnight the day before the
NHANES medical examination (CDC, 2005a, b). A phone
follow-up (PFU) interview was conducted 3­10 days after
the in-person interview using a measuring guide and set of
standard household measuring cups and spoons given to
respondents during the in-person interview (CDC, 2005b).
For both the in-person and PFU sessions, interviewers used
the USDA's Automated Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) to
record data. The public release data include estimates
of grams eaten by descriptive eight-digit food code by
respondent for both in-person and PFU interviews.
Construction of Food Consumption Categories
We focused our analyses on foods that are frequently
consumed by adults ages 18­60 and/or food items that are
likely to contain OP and/or pyrethroid pesticide residues.
First we made a list of frequently consumed foods (eaten by
Longitudinal dietary consumption patterns Riederer et al.

10% or more of respondents ages 18­60 in NHANES 2005­
2006) by NHANES eight-digit food code. We then added
foods with detectable OP and/or pyrethroid pesticide residues
in at least 5% of samples in the 2005 and 2006 USDA
Pesticide Data Program (USDA, 2006, 2007). Finally, we
aggregated the NHANES eight-digit food codes into
categories that matched the MAC data. For example, we
combined all eight-digit food codes for strawberries (includ-
ing raw, cooked or canned, and frozen) in NHANES 2005­
2006 into a single category we called ``strawberries'' to match
the MAC strawberries category. Table 1 presents the final list
of the 22 food items we used for the MAC versus NHANES
comparisons. This includes foods most commonly eaten by
NHANES adults and/or foods with detectable OP or
pyrethroid residues.
Statistical Analysis
We used the NHANES dietary interview weights as well as
the stratum and cluster variables for weighted analyses. We
used the SUDAAN 9.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) SUBPOPN statement
to subset the NHANES data to match the MAC age group
(ages 18­60), exclude pregnant subjects, and stratify by
gender. We used the SUDAAN CROSSTAB procedure to
calculate weighted consumption frequencies and 95% con-
fidence limits (CLs) by food item. We defined consumption
frequency as ``percent eaters,'' the percent of respondents
who reported eating a specific food item in a 24-h period. We
used SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) to calculate
percent eaters for each sampling day in the MAC cohort and
to calculate the percent of total sampling days (n ¼ 72) that
the MAC percent eaters fell below, within, or above the
NHANES 95% CLs. We tested differences in the NHANES
percent eaters by age group (ages 18­35 versus 36­60),
gender, and interview type (in-person versus PFU) using
the SUDAAN CROSSTAB procedure and the Cochran­
Mantel­Haenszel w2-test for survey data (significance at
Pp0.05). Last, to evaluate potential seasonal differences in
the daily MAC percent eaters estimates, we grouped sample
months by season: summer (June­August), fall (September­
November), winter (December­February), spring (March­
May), and used the Kruskal­Wallis test to evaluate whether
the number of eaters of a particular food on a given sampling
day differed significantly by season (significance at Pp0.05).
Results
NHANES 2005­2006 Analyses
Because we did not find a significant difference in percent
eaters between the NHANES 18­35 and 36­60 age groups for
the majority of foods analyzed (except bananas, grapes, and
soy milk), we opted to combine age groups. Likewise, percent
eaters did not differ by gender for the majority of foods (except
white rolls, tomato catsup, cauliflower, grapes, and plums)
thus we opted to analyze women and men together. A table of
percent eaters by gender and age group is included in the
Supplementary Information. Among women and men age 18­
60, there was no significant difference in percent eaters by
interview type for the majority of foods analyzed except for
lettuce, catsup, cream, peas, and spinach, thus we opted to
analyze only data from the in-person interview.
Metro Atlanta Cohort Characteristics
Table 2 presents demographic characteristics of the 37 MAC
participants included in the present analyses and the
NHANES adults. The MAC age distribution was similar
to that of the three-county population. However, women
were slightly overrepresented, as were African Americans,
whereas whites and other races were slightly underrepre-
sented. Residents of Fulton County were slightly under-
represented among these 37 whereas residents of Gwinnett

Adults: Percent Eaters by Food Item
Table 3 presents the weighted percent eaters and 95% CLs
among NHANES adults by food, the percent of sampling
days where the MAC percent eaters fell within, below, or
above the 95% CLs of the NHANES estimate, and the range
of the MAC percent eaters across the 72 sampling days. We
found that for certain foods, such as apple, spinach, tomato
catsup, and white bread/roll, the MAC percent eaters was
similar to the NHANES estimate, as the results in Table 3
show. In other words, the MAC value fell within the 95%
CLs of the NHANES estimate on 20% or more of sampling
days, and the number of Metro Atlanta days falling below
the NHANES 95% CLs was similar to the number falling
above. Other foods, including banana, broccoli, cream,
grapes, lettuce, onions, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string
beans, and tomatoes were generally eaten by a larger
percentage of MAC versus NHANES adults. For these
foods, the MAC percent eaters exceeded the NHANES
upper CL on approximately 60% or more of sampling days.
The MAC percent of milk drinkers was less than the
NHANES lower CL on two thirds of sampling days.
Cauliflower, cranberries, eggplant, plum, and soybeans were
not commonly eaten by either NHANES or MAC adults.
Among the MAC respondents, season was a significant
predictor of the number of peach and strawberry eaters on 4
of 6 and 3 of 6 sampling days, respectively, but not for other
foods. Figures 1 and 2 present the MAC daily percent eaters
by month and season for peaches and strawberries,
respectively, and compare them with the NHANES esti-
mates. For peaches, the percent eaters was highest during the
summer months (particularly July and August), when it was
2­5 times the upper NHANES 95% CL on almost all
sampling days. For strawberries, the percent eaters was
highest during the spring months, when it was 2­5 times the
upper NHANES 95% CL on almost all sampling days.

essential since the passage of the Food Quality Protection
Act (Food Quality Protection Act of 1996) as these patterns

often dictate the outcome of dietary pesticide exposure and
risk assessments. In addition, our own recent studies have
shown that dietary intake is a predominant route of exposure
to OP pesticides and, to a lesser extent, pyrethroid
insecticides (Lu et al., 2008, 2009). Although it is essential
to collect representative food consumption information and
to measure pesticide residue levels in food items that are
actually consumed to accurately quantify dietary pesticide
exposures of individuals, such efforts are resource intensive
thus rarely undertaken in population-based studies. Alter-
native methods combine statistical/mathematical models with
available residue and dietary consumption data to predict
dietary pesticide exposures for populations (Price et al., 2001;
US EPA, 2004). Under ideal circumstances, with high-
quality input data, a dietary pesticide exposure model could
be used to simulate the effect of regulatory activities on
population-level exposures and the anticipated reductions in
health risks.
Data from the MAC and other longitudinal studies could
be used to improve the predictive capacity of dietary pesticide
exposure models for relevant populations. In the MAC
study, we collected 72 days (6 consecutive days per week for
12 weeks) of daily dietary consumption data from a cohort of
Metro Atlanta adults over 1 calendar year. On average,
across all sampling days, a greater proportion of MAC
participants reported eating banana, broccoli, cream, grapes,
lettuce, onion, peach, pear, peas, strawberries, string beans,
and tomatoes than the national estimate, whereas the
proportion of apple, spinach, catsup, and white bread/roll
eaters was similar. The proportion of MAC participants

reporting milk consumption was generally lower than the
national estimate on most sampling days.
A simple sample calculation illustrates the relevance of our
findings to dietary pesticide exposure and risk assessments.
Assuming a predetermined residue concentration of pesticide
X in grapes of 50 ng/g and the consumption of 100 g for a
daily serving of grapes by adults, and ignoring body weight,
using the NHANES 2005­2006 percent eaters (3.8%) would
produce an (unweighted) 1-day 95th percentile intake
estimate of 0 mg. The 0 is explained by the fact that few
NHANES adults reported eating grapes. Using the highest
MAC percent eaters (26.7%) would produce a 95th
percentile (unweighted) intake estimate of 5 mg of pesticide
X. Repeating this calculation for apples (using the same
assumptions) would produce a 95th percentile (unweighted)
intake of 5 mg of pesticide X using the either the NHANES
data or the maximum MAC percent eaters (20.0%). Thus,
for some foods (e.g., apples) intake estimates at levels
important for dietary risk assessment, that is, the 95th
percentile, might not differ if the risk assessor used the
NHANES or MAC data, whereas for others (e.g., grapes)
the difference may be relevant.
The differences we observed for certain foods may be
attributable to either seasonal patterns or geographic
differences, or both. NHANES is a nationally representative
sample of eating patterns over a 2-year period; for
confidentiality reasons, the public release data do not contain
seasonal or geographic information. On any given day, a
higher proportion of MAC adults may eat certain foods than
the national average depending on seasonal availability,
cultural habits, or other factors. As Figures 1 and 2 show,
this is likely to be the case for peaches in summer and for
strawberries in spring. An intake assessment that ignored
such differences could significantly underestimate dietary
pesticide exposure. This is noteworthy because pesticide
residues are often detected in seasonally available commod-
ities like peaches and strawberries (USDA, 2006, 2007).
Some of the differences we observed may also be
attributable to differences in demographic characteristics.
First, our survey was designed to represent residents of a
large, metropolitan area (Atlanta), whereas NHANES
includes rural populations in addition to urban/suburban
populations. There is some evidence that eating habits differ
between urban and rural populations even after controlling
for race and income (Haines et al., 1996). Second, the MAC
cohort was slightly younger and with more female than
NHANES (Table 2). Although we did not find significant
differences by age group or gender in the NHANES data for
the majority of foods analyzed, these factors did influence the
percent eaters of certain foods. For example, the percent of
banana eaters among older (age 36­60) NHANES adults
was higher than that of younger (age 18­35) adults F
14.3% (11.9­17.0%, 95% CL) versus 6.3% (4.4­8.8%,
95% CL), respectively (Supplementary Table S1 in the
Supplementary Information). This age difference in banana
consumption was not apparent in the MAC data, however,
as the fraction of banana eaters only differed by age group on
8% of the 72 sampling days. Last, the MAC cohort
contained a higher proportion of African Americans
(48.7%) and a lower proportion of whites (37.8%) than
NHANES (12.5% and 69.7%, respectively). Although we
did not analyze the data by race, the literature contains
evidence of differences in dietary habits between African
Americans and white Americans even after controlling for
income and rural/urban status (Haines et al., 1996; McCabe-
Sellers et al., 2007).
Some of the differences we observed between the MAC
and NHANES data may also be attributable to survey
methodological differences and their associated measurement
error, although the magnitude of this error is difficult to
quantify. Using the NHANES AMPM (Multiple Pass)
method, a trained interviewer might be more effective at
eliciting dietary consumption information, particularly on
missing/forgotten foods, than using a participant-driven tool
like the iDL. However, participants who record foods in the
iDL as soon as they eat them may be less likely to miss foods
than those who wait 24 h to be interviewed. Regardless, it
appears that both NHANES and the iDL performed equally
regarding capturing the daily number of foods eaten. The
weighted mean number of food items recorded per
NHANES recall interview was 14.5 (14.0­15.0, 95% CL)
whereas the mean number of food items recorded per day
among the MAC participants ranged from 10.5 to 15.5.
Further, an analysis of the number of foods recorded per
MAC participant per day showed no evidence of subject
fatigue (i.e., a significant reduction in the daily number of
items recorded) or, conversely, subject learning (i.e., a
significant increase in the daily number of items recorded)
across the consecutive study days or months.
Another potential source of measurement error lies in the
scheme we used to match the NHANES eight-digit codes to
the MAC categories. In general, we only matched NHANES
codes that contained a particular food as the main ingredient
and not those that contained that food as part of a complex
recipe. For strawberries, for example, we did not match five
strawberry pie codes to the MAC strawberries category. We
chose this strategy based on our interpretation of the CDC
dietary interview protocols, which instruct interviewers to
probe for ingredients (CDC, 2006a). However, it is possible
that some foods in the NHANES database were recorded as
complex recipe foods (e.g., strawberry pie) instead of as main
ingredients (e.g., strawberries, pie crust), as we would have
recorded them in the MAC study. To investigate the effect of
this on our results, we developed an alternative matching
scheme where we matched all of the NHANES codes that
mentioned a particular food (e.g., all 13 codes containing the
word strawberry in the description, not including strawberry-

alternative scheme. Detailed results are presented in Supple-
mentary Table S2 of the Supplementary Information. For
most foods, use of the alternative scheme did not change our
conclusions. Exceptions were pear and white bread/roll.
When we expanded the pear category to include three recipe
codes (pies, cobbler, and dried fruit mix), the percent of
MAC sampling days above the NHANES 95% CL dropped
from 58.3% to 38.9%. On the basis of these alternative
results, we would change our conclusion and say that the
percent of pear eaters among the MAC participants was
similar to the NHANES estimate. The white bread/roll
coding presented a larger problem. There were 195
NHANES codes beyond the 11 we initially matched to the
MAC white category. Most of these included complex recipes
for sandwiches, hamburgers, and so on, in some cases where
the bread grain was not specified, but where white would be a
reasonable guess (e.g., 27515010: steak sandwich, plain, on
roll). When we included these 195 additional codes, the
NHANES weighted percent eaters jumped from 26.9%
(23.1­33.4%) to 46.5% (41.7­51.3%), and the percent of
MAC days below the NHANES 95% CL jumped from
22.2% to 87.5%. On the basis of these alternative results, we
would say that fewer MAC participants reported eating white
bread/roll than NHANES participants on most sampling
days.
We report differences in dietary consumption frequencies
between NHANES and MAC adults for certain food items,
in particular commodities with seasonal availability like
peaches and strawberries. These comparisons illustrate how a
longitudinal study like MAC captures seasonal variability in
dietary habits in contrast to a cross-sectional study like
NHANES that is not designed to capture this variability.
They also call into question the use of national, cross-
sectional food consumption databases for characterizing
dietary patterns in subpopulations and illustrate how doing
so might lead to an underestimation of pesticide exposure
when seasonal consumption data are annualized. In addition
to seasonal differences in the consumption of certain foods
(e.g., peaches), there are seasonal differences in pesticide use.
For commodities such as those in Table 3, seasonal
differences in the presence or magnitude of different
pesticides may be significant. Taken together with seasonal
consumption differences, the possible error in exposure
assessment may be magnified.
Although the NHANES sampling plan was designed
based on sophisticated statistical methods to capture a
nationally representative sample, there are physical limita-
tions to its ability to capture longitudinal or seasonal dietary
consumption trends. Specifically, the NHANES sampling
team rotates around the country over the survey period
(CDC, 2009b). A surge in consumption of a given food in
one geographical region during a season that NHANES did
not survey would not be adequately characterized by data
collected from another region during the same season if that
region did not experience a similar surge. Such relationships
are difficult to characterize if seasonal sampling is not
conducted in all regions. The National Center for Health
Statistics has emphasized that NHANES data are meant to
capture national trends (CDC, 2006b) that may not apply to
specific seasons or geographic regions. This disclaimer is
sometimes overlooked and the NHANES data are used for
risk assessment without proper acknowledgement of the
limitations. In this article, we have shown the importance of
collecting seasonal dietary consumption information within a
region. In the meantime, sensitivity analyses using data from
the MAC or other longitudinal studies might be used by risk
assessors to determine whether the costs of collecting
longitudinal data from their target cohorts are justified.
