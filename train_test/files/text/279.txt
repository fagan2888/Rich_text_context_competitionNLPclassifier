Objective: To determine the relation between body mass index and the development of asthma in children.
Design: Prospective study of 4393 asthma-free children followed for up to 14 years.
Setting: Children of participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth.
Methods: Analysis was limited to children who were followed from birth and were asthma-free during the first 24 months of life.
The outcome was the development of asthma during follow-up (incident asthma). Body mass index (BMI) was our main
predictor of interest. Survival analyses, using time to development of asthma as the main endpoint, were stratified by sex and
controlled for race/ethnicity, poverty status, and prenatal maternal smoking.
Results: Asthma developed in 218 (5.0 %) children during the follow-up period. The relation between BMI and incident asthma
varied by sex. A BMI X85th percentile at age 2­3 years was a risk factor for subsequent asthma development in boys (hazard
ratio (HR) 1.6 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1, 2.4) but not girls (HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.4). Similarly, boys with BMIs always
X85th percentile were at increased risk for subsequent asthma development (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4, 4.4) but not girls (HR 1.5,
95% CI 0.7, 2.9).
Conclusion: Boys with high body masses may be at an increased risk for developing asthma.

Introduction
Asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in
the United States and asthma prevalence has increased since
the 1980s.1,2 A combination of environmental and lifestyle
factors may be related to the rise in asthma cases.3
The incidence of obesity in children and adults has risen
concurrently with asthma in the last 20 years.4,5 Obese
patients are observed to have changes in lung function.6­9 In
addition, adipose tissue is biologically active, associated with
elevated markers of systemic inflammation that might
contribute to asthma.10 Cross-sectional studies in children
and adults have confirmed a strong association between
obesity and asthma in both males and females.11­16 How-
ever, most longitudinal studies linking obesity and the
development of asthma or asthma-like symptoms have been
in adults.17­20 One longitudinal study in children, by Castro-
Rodriguez et al., analyzing results of the Tucson Children's
Respiratory Study, is limited by smaller numbers and the
non-national data sample.18 Another study found an effect
in boys, but not in girls.21
This study examines the relationship between obesity and
asthma in children using prospective, nationally representative
data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY).

adults who were interviewed yearly or biyearly from 1979 to
2000, as well as a supplemental sample of Hispanics, African
Americans, and whites of lower socioeconomic status.
Children of these participants were included in the survey
starting in 1986, with data collected prospectively in
`rounds' every 2 years. Details of NLSY assessment metho-
dology, attrition, and other matters are described in detail
elsewhere.4,22,23 Informed consent was obtained from all
adult participants.
In order to examine risk factors for the development of
asthma, the analysis was restricted to children who first
entered the cohort prior to age 2 years and were asthma-free
prior to age 2 years and at the time of their first body mass
index (BMI) measurement (measured at age 2 or 3 years). In
addition, the analysis was limited to subjects who partici-
pated in at least two rounds of the survey.
Participants
Of the 11 300 children who were surveyed at some point in
NLSY the following were excluded: 5574 whose initial
participation occurred after age 24 months, 586 who only
participated in one survey, 58 who had asthma prior to age
24 months, 94 who had asthma at their first survey with a
classifiable BMI, and 595 who did not have a classifiable BMI
at the baseline evaluation. The final analytic cohort
contained 4393 subjects.
Demographics, and variable definitions
The following variables were included in the analysis: sex,
race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, or white), poverty status,
prenatal maternal smoking history, birth weight, and BMI.
Children were classified as having a mention of poverty if
this was noted in any survey they participated in. Weights
and heights were measured either by an in-home interviewer
using a portable scale and tape measure or reported by the
parent.4 In this analysis, 69% of the height and 61% of the
weights were measured. The BMI was calculated by dividing
the weight in kilograms by the height in m2. Observations
from subjects in whom the BMI was p10 or X70 kg/m2 were
excluded as likely measurement errors, reporting errors, or
signs of extreme medical condition.4 The most recent
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth curves were used
to determine the BMI percentile.24 Children were classified
based on their BMI percentile at the baseline evaluation into
three mutually exclusive categories (o25th, 25th­84th, and
X85th percentile).25 Children were also classified using the
same three categories at the subsequent evaluations they
participated in. Asthma-free children were categorized based
on their BMI classifications over multiple visits into four
categories: always o25th percentile, always X85th percen-
tile, at least one time X85th percentile, and others (consist-
ing of children not in one of the other three categories).
Children who were previously `asthma-free' were classified
as developing asthma (incident asthma) if their parent
reported they either had asthma that limited their activity
or required the use of medication or frequent attention from
a doctor.
Statistical analysis
For analyses, both SAS and SUDAAN26,27 were used. Person-
years at risk were determined by using the time from the
baseline evaluation to either the final evaluation or the
evaluation during which asthma was reported. Cox propor-
tional hazard regression models were developed using the
SAS procedure PHREG to account for differential follow-up
in study participants. The time of follow-up was the under-
lying time metric. Plots of the log­log survival curves for
each covariate were used to demonstrate that the propor-
tional hazards assumptions were met. The effect of BMI was
analyzed in two different ways: as a time varying covariate
and as an independent variable at each of the first four
evaluations. Models were developed to determine whether
the BMI predicted the development of asthma, after adjust-
ing for race, sex, prenatal maternal smoking history, birth
weight, and poverty status. HR and 95% CI are reported.
In addition, we repeated the analyses in subgroups stratified
by sex, due the previous reported evidence of different effects
of BMI on asthma incidence in males compared to
females.18,19,21
Results
Of the 4393 children in our analytic cohort, all of whom
were initially surveyed prior to age 24 months and asthma
free at that time, 218 (5.0 %) developed asthma during the
follow-up period of 26 657 person-years1. In the 5574
children excluded because they were not followed since
birth, 364 (6.5 %) had asthma noted at least once (either at
baseline or follow-up). Other demographic characteristics of
the population are shown in Table 1.
The demographic characteristics of our analytic cohort for
each round of the survey are shown in Table 2. From 1986
through 2000, the proportion of subjects with at least one
mention of poverty decreased from 46.2 to 37.0%, the
proportion of children with prenatal maternal smoking
reported decreased from 36.3 to 24.9%, and the mean BMI
percentile increased from 51 in 1988 to 65 in 2000 (Po0.05
for test of trend for each comparison).
The overall incidence of asthma in our cohort was 8.2
cases per 1000 person-years at risk (Table 1). The median age
for new cases of asthma was 7.6 years (25th percentile 4.3
years, 75th percentile 9.8 years). These data also suggested a
higher rate of incident asthma among children whose BMI
was X85th percentile compared to those o25th percentile
(10.4 vs 6.4 cases per 1000 person-years) and among boys
compared to girls (9.5 vs 6.8 cases per 1000 person-years,
Table 1).

The overall incidence of asthma among boys decreased
from 9.5 cases per 1000 person-years at age 2­3 years to 7.5
cases per 1000 person years at age 8­9 years, while this rate
increased among girls, from 6.8 to 7.5 cases per 1000 person-
years (Tables 3 and 4). The overall survival curves depicting
the development of asthma by baseline BMI category
showed that a higher proportion of children X85th
percentile developed asthma, compared to children in the
other groups (Figure 1). The relation between BMI and
incident asthma varied by sex. For example, a higher
proportion of boys than girls whose BMI was X85th
percentile at baseline developed asthma (13.7 vs 6.7 cases
per 1000 person years, Tables 3 and 4).
Variables in the multivariate proportional hazard models
that predicted incident asthma included male sex (HR 1.4,
95% CI 1.04, 1.8), prenatal maternal smoking (HR 1.5, 95%
CI 1.1, 2.1), a BMI X85th percentile at age 4­5 years (HR 1.8,
95% CI 1.2, 2.6) or BMI as a time varying covariate always
X85th percentile (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.3, 3.1, Table 5). In the
stratified analyses, there was evidence that the relation
between BMI and asthma development varied by sex. A BMI
X85th percentile at age 2­3 was a risk factor for asthma
development in boys (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.4) but not girls
(HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5, 1.4). Similarly, when looking at BMI as a
time varying covariate, boys with BMIs always X85th
percentile were at increased risk for subsequent asthma
development (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4, 4.4) but not girls (HR 1.5,
95% CI 0.7, 2.9) (Table 5). In a similar analysis restricted to
children with only measured heights and weights at each
visit (2036 of 4393), results were similar (data not shown).
Discussion
In this longitudinal study of 4393 children followed for up to
14 years, the overall incidence of asthma was 8.2 cases per
1000 person-years at risk. The relationship between BMI and
asthma development varied by sex: boys, but not girls,
whose BMI was X85th percentile at age 2­3 years were more
likely to develop asthma and this increased risk (when
looking at BMI as a time varying covariate) persisted for boys,
but not girls (Table 5).

The primary finding was that some children with high
BMIs were more likely to develop asthma during follow-up.
Previous studies of the relation between incident asthma and
body mass in children have been limited in sample size,18
duration of follow-up,21 and age at which the cohort started
follow-up.18,21 In one study of school-age children, 6-year-
old girls who became obese by age 11 or 13 were more likely
to report asthma like symptoms,18 whereas in another study,
7-year-old boys who were overweight or obese were more
likely to report asthma over the next 4 years.21 The present
study differs from these previous ones in that all participants
were studied from birth and were followed for up to 14 years.
Thus, the different outcomes observed in prior studies may
be a function of the age at which the children were studied
and duration of follow-up.
The relation between obesity and asthma has been the
subject of multiple studies in recent years. Proposed
mechanisms for this observation include genetic fac-
tors,13,17,28 obesity-related inflammation,10,29 pulmonary
dysfunction,7,17,30­32 sedentary lifestyle,13,17,33,34 dietary

spiratory symptoms and medication use,37 and gastric
reflux.13,31 The present findings neither support nor refute
any of these proposed mechanisms.
This analysis attempted to determine whether a BMI
o25th percentile was a risk factor for asthma development
during follow-up. The data suggested this might be a risk
factor in 4­7 year old children,5 but was not statistically
significant. Some studies have suggested a curvilinear
relation between bronchial responsiveness or asthma inci-
dence and BMI.9,19 Asthma is a chronic illness and some
chronic illnesses are associated with lower BMIs.38,39 In
addition, asthma has several different phenotypic presenta-
tions, so it is possible that different phenotypes of asthma
may be affected by BMI in different ways.40
In this study, the overall incidence of asthma among
included children was 8.2 per 1000 person-years at risk. This
rate is comparable to that seen in several studies of
children,41­43 but less than the rate of 22.6 per 1000
person-years at risk reported by Gilliland et al.21 This study
was designed to look at the effect of BMI on incident asthma,
and standards for classifying BMI in children do not exist
prior to age 24 months. Thus, the study had to exclude
children who had asthma prior to age 24 months and those
whose first BMI was obtained at the same time they were
reported to have asthma. A result of this is that the overall
incidence of asthma in all of the children followed from
birth in this cohort would have been higher than 8.2 per
1000.
This study is subject to several limitations. Asthma was
proxy-reported and not verified by either the use of medical
records, physician contact, or other means. The definition of
asthma used in this study was not the traditional one (has
your child ever been diagnosed by a physician with

The models included either the body mass index (BMI) classification at each of
the first four visits or the BMI as a time varying covariate. From the National
Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1986­2000. aLimited to children who were
asthma-free at first and second surveys. bLimited to children who were asthma-
free at first, second, and third surveys. cLimited to children who were asthma-
free at first, second, third, and fourth surveys. dThis included all assessments of
BMI either prior to the report of asthma or the exit from the survey.
Body mass index and incident asthma

asthma?)2 but limited to those children whose parents
reported that they had a condition that limited their ability
to attend school, play, work, or participate in games or sports
OR required frequent attention from a doctor or regular use
of medicine. Thus, this analysis may not have included
children with very mild asthma who did not meet those
criteria. Also, there is no way to separate out true asthma
from obesity-related dyspnea. Another possibility is that
children with high BMIs may be more likely to have activity
limitations or require more frequent use of medication,
thus resulting in their being counted as asthma cases more
than similar children with normal BMIs. Finally, we only
saw a significant effect of elevated BMI on asthma among
boys, who had a higher incidence of asthma than girls in
this study. If, however, this study could be extended into
young adulthood, when the incidence of asthma among
women increases above that seen in men, the relation
between elevated BMI and asthma could also be seen among
women.
In conclusion, this analysis suggests a complex relation
between BMI and incident asthma among children that may
vary by sex. This finding needs further study with more
traditional assessments of asthma outcomes. Overall, this
study found that boys with high BMIs were at increased risk
for developing asthma, although there appear to be vulner-
able ages for both boys and girls during which being
overweight increases the risk for the development of asthma.
