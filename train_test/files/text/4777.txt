Prologue: entrance
To tell you about Penthesilea I should begin by describing the
entrance to the city. You, no doubt, imagine seeing a girdle of
walls rising from the dusty plain as you slowly approach the
gate, guarded by customs men who are already casting oblique
glances at your bundles. Until you have reached it you are
outside it; you pass beneath an archway and you find yourself
within the city. If this is what you believe you are wrong;
Penthesilea is different.
In this way, the traveller in Italo Calvino's novel Invisible
Cities begins his tale of Penthesilea, one of the cities he
describes for the old emperor Kublai Khan. Khan's power is
in a state of decline, he fears his empire is falling apart, but
in the traveller's descriptions, he seeks the lost order: `One
day when I know all the emblems', he asks the traveller,
`shall I be able to possess my empire, at last?' But the travel-
ler answers. `Sire, do not believe it. On that day you will be
an emblem among emblems'. Still, the emperor asks the
world to show itself as a mapped territory of land, resources,
buildings, cities and so on; by knowing it all, he hopes to
regain the power to possess and master it. However, Marco
Polo, the Venetian traveller, does not bring back this over-
view; rather, he brings in the details, the unusual, the infinite,
the dreamlike, that which is only half glimpsed from the
Documenting the invisible ­ on the `how' of
process research: (Re)considering method
from process philosophy

Abstract
Currently, there is a growing field in organization studies, reflecting a stream in social science more broadly, which seeks
to encompass a process philosophical view of the world as multiple and in constant becoming. However, this raises new
questions and challenges to the field of methodology: If movement and process are the basic forms of the universe, then
the vagueness and multiplicity that come with the flux of the world are not to be ruled out by rigorous research designs;
rather, relating to vagueness and multiplicity may be the very precondition of approaching the studied phenomena. For some
scholars, this has been an occasion for deeming the discipline of methodology `dead' or `emptied'. In contrast to such claims,
this article argues that the scholar doing empirical research from approaches drawing on process philosophy to no less
extent than other scholars must deal with problems of methodological character. However, he or she may need a renewed
understanding of traditional methodological categories such as documentation, validity and variation. Rather than cancelling
such concepts, this article experimentally reconsiders them in a process view, using a piece of observational material to
think from. The article suggests that process philosophy may open up a methodological thinking that has room for a more
connotative, playful way of relating to research material ­ which does not demand from a method to overcome the gap
between what is there and what is captured but makes use of this gap as a space of invitation and play. Rather than adhering
to the promise of ruling out vagueness and filling out a gap, the article, therefore, in itself aims at being such an invitation for
a connotative, playful methodology.

corner of the eye. After a while, Kublai Khan starts to doubt
the reality of the traveller's tales of the cities: Is it actually
the territory out there ­ the cities of his empire ­ that Marco
Polo is describing to him? Or has it been one and the same
city he has been describing all along? Is it simply Marco
Polo's own city, Venice, that the emperor has begun to know
through Marco Polo's many tales?
Hereby Khan poses a question that has been foundational
to the discipline of method in social science: How can we be
sure that the descriptions and information we receive from
research in the world `out there' actually correspond to the
world they are claimed to describe? How can we be certain
that it is not simply the researcher's own world ­ habits,
taste, inclinations ­ that we are learning about, rather than
the world out there? The discipline of method has been given
the role of establishing this guarantee of correspondence
between the world and what is stated, claimed and described
about it. The more rigorous the method that guides the work
process, the stronger the link between reality and statement
and the more solid the ground on which we stand when we
claim something. Method is here a matter of developing and
mastering procedures and techniques that can provide some
kind of guarantee of the link (or absence of a link) between a
statement and a reality. Is it like this or is it not?
Trying to overcome this problem of correspondence, the
emperor claims that from now on he will describe a city and
then Marco Polo can go out and see whether it exists as he
has conceived of it. But the cities that Marco Polo has trav-
elled to are always different from those conceived by the
emperor. Khan, impatiently, moves on by suggesting a model
from which he can deduce all cities: `It contains everything
corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge
in varying degrees from the norm, I need only foresee the
exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable com-
binations'. Marco Polo, however, takes this reasoning to its
ultimate consequence by reversing its logic. He thereby
shows how such models may serve us so well in terms of
describing the general and the probable that we at last
`achieve cities too probable to be real'. In this way, he shows
how a correspondence reasoning ­ regardless of whether it
starts from the general model and moves towards the particu-
lar or vice versa ­ may produce averaged-out themes and
descriptions, too probable to be real. In searching for regu-
larities and patterns while eliminating outliers, unexplaina-
ble phenomena and the half glimpsed, the `realness' is lost,
since the real lies in the multiple, elusive and constantly
unfolding nature of the researched: Describing the city is
describing a multiplicity of invisible cities.
Introduction: process thinking and
method
Currently, there is a growing field in organization studies that
seeks to encompass this premise of the world as multiple and
in constant becoming (Helin et al., 2014; Hernes, 2014;
Hernes and Maitlis, 2010; Hjorth et al., 2015; Langley and
Tsoukas, 2017). All things that we might study have multiple
becomings; there is always a multiplicity of incipiencies
pressing against the actuality of the studied phenomena
(Massumi, 2002). These are not less real; they are real in
their virtuality (Bergson, 2010). In other words, they are not
actualized presently. However, if everything has multiple
becomings, then the discipline of method, if it is understood
as creating correspondence between `what is' and `what is
claimed', becomes problematic. If movement and process
are the basic forms of the universe, then the vagueness and
multiplicity that come with movement are not to be ruled out
by research design; rather, relating to vagueness and multi-
plicity is the very precondition of approaching the studied
phenomena. This leaves us with the question of what method
is ­ if it is at all. Throughout the past two decades, the death
of method has been announced in different ways, for exam-
ple, by suggesting that method is emptied and must be
replaced by analytical strategy (Andersen, 2003) or that we
have reached a time of `after method' (Law, 2004).
However, the scholar conducting empirical studies on the
basis of process thinking must still relate to `the how' of
research. And here, questions of a methodological nature
tend to leak in again, surprisingly unaffected by the claimed
`death' of method. When process researchers go into the
field, they must still decide whether to do observations, inter-
views, document studies and so on; how to do them, who to
include, what to do with the material afterwards; how much
material they need, how to treat the material, how to write
about it; and what the basis is for pointing out or claiming
anything from the material that is gathered. Such questions
have traditionally been treated in the context of terms such as
`documentation', `validity' and `variation'. This article sug-
gests that we need to revisit and discuss such fundamental
methodological categories framed by the correspondence
thinking in order to advance the `how' of process research in
organization studies. The article is an attempt to contribute to
such moving further.
Thus, the interest of the article is, `Can we think of method
in organization studies without asking the world to reveal
itself to us as distinctions, categories and causal regularities
that we can map and master?' `Can we know without this
demand for overview, explicitness and explanatory closure?'
The role of method here would not be about overcoming the
gap between what is captured and what is there but would
rather be about relating to this tension, playing with the gap
itself. However, this still leaves the researcher with the ques-
tion, `If studying something is about relating to its multiplic-
ity ­ if process research means relating to the virtuality of the
studied phenomena ­ then what does this actually mean in
terms of gathering, processing and writing about empirical
material?' In this article, I aim to address this `how' of pro-
cess research on the basis of an example of a specific piece
of empirical material and on this background discuss and
reframe classic method categories.
Pallesen 3
The structure of the article is as follows: I start by briefly
introducing process thinking in organization studies and then
discuss current contributions to thinking about method that
go beyond correspondence thinking. Next, I inquire into `the
how' of process thinking using a specific piece of empirical
material as an example. On the basis of this, I revisit and
rethink traditional methodological categories, particularly
the concepts of documentation, validity and variation.
Process thinking in organization studies
To provide some clarity about what I refer to as process
research here, it might be useful to draw a basic distinction
between two different meanings of `process research'.
According to one, the term process refers to the study object;
according to the other, process reflects a basic understanding
of the world. In the former sense, process research means
studying process as something contrasted to a stable situa-
tion before and after the process (e.g. the implementation of
new legislation or the translation of strategy into new prac-
tice). In the latter sense of process research, which I take up
in this article, the term process reflects a basic understanding
of the world, on which we must understand all kinds of activ-
ities we might study. Hence, `the processual' in the latter
approach does not lie in studying process as something that
has to be explained; instead, process refers to an understand-
ing of the world as continuously and relationally under
construction.
Thus, process research in this sense is characterized by
drawing on process philosophy, that is, on thinkers who do
not take their point of departure in subjects and objects but in
an ever unfolding middle of becoming. Heraklit, Bergson,
Whitehead and Deleuze are often seen as process philoso-
phers, but also thinkers associated with American pragma-
tism, such as Mead, Peirce, Dewey and James, have been
associated with process philosophy. A relatively recent hand-
book on process philosophy and organization studies includes
processual readings of 34 thinkers; among them are central
philosophical figures in the history of continental philoso-
phy, such as Nietzsche, Heidegger, Wittgenstein, Ricoeur
and Foucault (Helin et al., 2014). This long list of names
indicates that process research is not easily nailed down to a
few main points; however, it seems reasonable to say that
giving becoming ontological primacy over being lies at the
heart of it.
Thus, understanding the nature of becoming and move-
ment is central to process philosophy. The French philoso-
pher Henri Bergson (1910, 2007 [1946]) is a key figure here.
To understand the order of reality that characterizes move-
ment, we must understand the difference between qualitative
and quantitative multiplicity, he points out. To illustrate the
difference, musical scores are a quantitative multiplicity,
marked separately as notes on staves that succeed and
exclude each other in space (on paper), whereas music is a
qualitative multiplicity ­ the experienced passing of tones
that interpenetrate each other but cannot be sliced into pieces
or represented, since what music is cannot be separated from
this indivisible sensation of movement. Scores exist in space,
while music exists in time. It does not exist out there but in
our experience as a felt duration. Thus, while space can be
measured and divided into quantitative entities, movement is
a dynamic unity (Massumi, 2002), which is why we cannot
change one tone in a melody without changing its whole.
Later in this article, I will return to the methodological con-
sequences of this different order of reality of movement,
pointed out by Bergson.
On this ground of insisting on the link between process
philosophy and process research, there is a growing field of
processual reframing of established organizational concepts:
Hjorth and Steyaert rethink the concept of entrepreneurship
(Hjorth and Steyaert, 2009; Steyaert, 2007) by introducing
process philosophical concepts such as `affect' and `desire'
into the dominating entrepreneurship discourse. This also
opens up for a rethinking of social entrepreneurship as pub-
lic entrepreneurship, thus emphasizing the desire for the
social (Hjorth, 2013). Chia and Holt (2009) rethink the con-
cept of strategy and emphasize strategy as emergent from
local coping actions instead of an intentional outcome of a
grand plan and link this to a Heideggerian notion of `dwell-
ing'. These contributions, in line with the reframing of the
category of organization as organizing (Weick, 1979), distin-
guish themselves from previous processual rethinkings of
organizational categories (e.g., Stacey, 2007) by insisting not
only on the primacy of relation and process but also on the
link to process philosophical concepts such as `affect',
`desire'and `becoming'that question the subject­object divi-
sion and the purposeful (causally ordered) being in the world
as ontologically fundamental.
Methodological approaches in social
science inspired by process thinking
In the attempt to move further the focus on the `how' of
process research, I do not intend to claim that method in
social science has been unaffected by process thinking. An
increasing number of contemporary scholars strive in dif-
ferent ways to deal methodologically with the world as
multiple and in constant becoming. We might even speak of
a wider methodological shift in social science (Coleman
and Ringrose, 2013): a growing call for methods that are
messy (Law, 2004), affective and sensory (Pink, 2009); that
are performative (Beyes and Steyaert, 2012; Dirksmeier
and Helbrecht, 2008; Steyaert, 2012); and that see research
as creation (McCormack, 2008; Massumi, 2002, 2008;
Murphie, 2008).
These attempts to rethink method emphasize in different
ways that research is a matter of not only studying what is
`already there' but also actively creating and adding to the
studied world. All of these contributions in some way call for
a move from understanding research as representation (i.e.
4 Methodological Innovations
reflecting/illustrating what is there) towards understanding
research as creation. However, it is worth noting that creation
is here understood differently than in the constructionist
sense of `creating' as constructing the world through per-
spectives of the world.
In contrast, scholars within this shift towards performa-
tive methodology tend to understand research as something
that not only changes how we think about the world but also
alters the world ontologically. Or more precisely, the whole
idea of perspective (i.e. how we see the world) as some-
thing that exists at another level than reality (i.e. what the
world is) is fundamentally questioned. Instead, method, as
well as theory, is located on the same flat plane as the stud-
ied practices. They are practices themselves and thus add to
the world. This problematization of the distinction perspec-
tive/world is not new, however. Already in 1920, the phi-
losopher Alfred Whitehead critically considered what he
labelled `the bifurcation of nature': the split between the
world/things out there (separated from any subject) and the
subject, the perspectives in here (separated from the world)
(Latour, 2004: 208).
Hence, method, as well as theory, does not exist on a purer
or more ordered level than reality ­ it is always an interven-
tion in the messy, continuously practised world. This rethink-
ing of methodology as performative, messy, creative and so
on shares with constructivism a basic scepticism of the `cor-
respondence idea' of method referred to above. They both
reject the positivist ideal that method can provide us with
some degree of certainty that the world is what the statement/
theory says it is. However, it tends to have another conse-
quence: Instead of limiting research to a question of episte-
mology, it implies a return to ontology ­ not ontology in the
positivist sense as a question of what the world is, but rather
an ontology of becoming. Reality is not inaccessible (we
cannot not access reality since we are always already in the
midst of it); rather, reality is constantly enacted and per-
formed in situated practices, and therefore constantly enfold-
ing, expanding and multiplying. It is not just our perspectives
of the world that are multiple but the world itself. Therefore,
method must necessarily deal with the impossible closure of
knowledge. In other words, method now becomes a matter of
how to keep knowledge open and multiple when we do
research (Beyes and Steyaert, 2012; Law, 2004; Murphie,
2008).
The methodological task therefore becomes to `imagine
methods when they no longer seek the definite, the repeata-
ble, the more or less stable' (Law, 2004: 6) ­ in other words,
methods that are `tentative, hesitant, intuitive, slow and
uncertain' (Law, 2004: 6). Law even compares it to a blind
person with a stick: His blindness handicaps him, but he also
has the force of the more intense feeling of the stick as he
moves forward (Law, 2004: 10). Clearly, this account of
method implies another idea of clarity and rigour: The meth-
odological task is `to find ways of knowing the indistinct and
slippery without trying to grasp and hold them tight' (Law,
2004: 10). In opposition to common connotations of know-
ing (e.g. providing some kind of guarantee, being sufficiently
sure about something), Law talks about knowing as some-
thing that calls for `techniques of deliberate imprecision'
(Law, 2004: 3). He even often leaves the language of tech-
niques behind and talks of a sense of method. The words he
offers the reader for this kind of methodological understand-
ing (i.e. `quieter', `more generous', `broader', `looser') tend
to designate an attitude rather than a technique.
Interestingly, this (performative) account of method often
cancels the promises of conventional method (e.g. precision,
tempo, order) and suggests the exact opposite (e.g. impreci-
sion, slowness, mess). Law invites the reader to an interest-
ing tour beyond current methods, but not to a new method.
This might be his whole point (with the title `after method'in
mind): When the idea that knowledge should reflect a stable
reality is left behind, the concept of method is emptied.
However, it is worth noting that the discipline of method has
been claimed to be dead before ­ without dying. For exam-
ple, it has been argued that method should be replaced by
analytical strategy on the basis of the constructivist reason-
ing mentioned above (Andersen, 2003): Since we cannot
access reality directly, all we can do is to be precise about our
epistemological ground. In other words, we must account for
the perspectives through which we create reality. However,
as academic debates have since shown, scholars within this
paradigm continued to struggle with methodological ques-
tions that could not be limited to a matter of analytical strat-
egy (Andersen, 2005).
Since the suggestion of methodological `imprecision' or
`looseness' does not mean that anything goes, scholars doing
empirical research in a process philosophical perspective
must still consider the `how' ­ and, in that sense, still need
some concept of method, albeit a somewhat different one
than the ones offered by correspondence thinking. Therefore,
the challenge for the scholar doing empirical work inspired
by these processual approaches is, `If studying something
processually is about relating to its multiple becomings ­ and
hence the vagueness and slipperiness of the studied phenom-
ena ­ then what does this actually mean in terms of gather-
ing, processing and writing about empirical material?' In the
next section, I will discuss this on the background of a spe-
cific piece of empirical material.
Studying entrance ­ an example
The piece that I will now take up stems from observations
made during 3 days that I spent at the entrance of an activity
centre for citizens who are in contact with the social psychi-
atric system. In Danish, this activity centre is called
`værested', which can be directly translated to `being place'.
`Being'refers to the fact that the users of the centre do not get
medical or any other treatment at the centre. It is a place
where users can come and get something to eat, take part in
activities or just hang out. The centre is organized by the
Pallesen 5
local municipality and run by a social psychiatric team, who
also visit users in their homes. I have been allowed into the
centre to study the encounter between users and the centre as
part of a research project focusing on the dynamics of wel-
fare creation in the encounter between professionals and citi-
zens ­ and how welfare management can be (re-)understood
in this context. The observations are therefore part of a wider
material, including interviews with five other leaders, pre-
ceded by observations or other preparatory material and suc-
ceeded by four collaborative sessions with employees and
leaders in three other institutions. From previous interviews
in this centre, we know that the team manager currently
places high priority on maintaining focus on the user in the
organization of the team's work (e.g. by adapting the open-
ing hours to the rhythm of the users' lives) and with enhanc-
ing the team's attention to the users' resources, which is also
inscribed in a wider political agenda of seeing `the citizen as
resourceful'.
Already in explaining the research focus, as I just did in
these lines, a number of categories are implied: the user, the
manager, the entrance, the centre, and so on. However, in the
interests of process research, we are concerned with how
they come into being in an organizational context (Hjorth
et al., 2015): their multiple becomings, the vagueness of
incipiencies by which their `realness' lives. So, rather than
starting with entities, categories or places, assuming that
they are already there and then trying to find regularities in
how they relate to each other, the challenge of the empirical
work is to find ways to connect to the multiplicity and vague-
ness of these categories. In the process described here, this
was attempted in various ways, some of which were planned
and others which grew more spontaneously out of the pro-
cess. In the next section, I will try to stay with the category
`entrance' ­ which is both the site of observation and an
activity in focus for it ­ through five vignettes (entrance and
absence, entrance and hesitation, entrance and becoming-
other, entrance and space, entrance and habit) made from
rewritten observation notes and inspired by Calvino's
Invisible Cities. Subsequently, I will discuss the `how' of
process research from this example and take up some meth-
odological issues in relation to it.
Entrance and absence
The first day the researcher arrives at the activity centre to do
observations, she is led upstairs and into an apartment that
has been converted into an office. The staff tell her that after
the announcement of her arrival, some of the users had
expressed concern about someone coming from outside.
They had started wondering: Could it be the municipality
that is behind this? Were they thinking of closing down the
place since they have sent someone from outside to observe?
She states that she will interfere as little as possible in order
to reduce unnecessary anxiety as much as she can. The staff
and the researcher go down to the activity centre in the
basement of the building. Ten or fifteen minutes pass without
anyone entering the room except for three staff members.
One of them, a young woman, says, `It's strange. Normally
they would have been here'. Her colleague nods at the
researcher: `Maybe it's because of the announcement of you
being here, they might have been frightened'. The researcher
feels bad about having interfered and having caused anxiety
for these (in her mind) vulnerable, ill people before she has
even entered their centre. Ten more minutes pass before the
first user enters: an elderly man. By this point, the researcher
has withdrawn to the office area of the room, where she can
be on the sidelines, but his eyes immediately seek into her
corner behind the staff members. However, since she is `not
there', she does not know how to greet him. A staff member,
the young woman, notices their searching glance and takes a
step back as an invitation for them to connect. The researcher
steps out of the office area and the man approaches her. He
starts asking questions in an open interested way. He knows
a bald professor: Does she perhaps know him? She laughs a
bit and says that there is a majority of bald professors, she
guesses. But the staff member persists, asking `Which insti-
tute was it?'As they slowly walk along the oblong entrance,
the user and researcher talk about the institute and the profes-
sor that it actually turns out that she knows.
Entrance and hesitation
More users enter the room. A scraping of chairs blends with
voices to create a steady and soft background noise. The
researcher is already aware that she is not observing in the
way she had planned. Rather than observations from the
sidelines, she is observing from within activities and conver-
sations. As a consequence, a lot of things happen around her
that she does not grasp. However, becoming part of the
steady, slow rhythm of the centre, she starts to notice small
changes in it. Later, numerous users have found their way to
the centre. Two users are entering the room. They keep stand-
ing at the step down to the room. One member of staff, a
middle-aged woman, gets up and starts walking towards
them, but then something apparently makes her hesitate
approximately 5 m in front of them. The staff member greets
them and sends a `Happy New Year'through the room across
the distance between them. Then she waits for a long
moment. The users do not take the expected step down into
the room; they just keep standing there, a bit stiff. The staff
member raises her hand, and one of the users lifts his hand
slightly. Then the staff member takes a step back and returns
to the kitchen.After a while, the two users enter the room and
blend into the crowd.
Entrance and becoming-other
The staff meeting is about to begin in the usual meeting room
on the third floor, equipped with an oval table and a white-
board covered with words and arrows in red, left over from
6 Methodological Innovations
the previous meeting. The researcher is given the floor by the
manager. She has promised to present the observations from
the entrance of the centre and therefore start by describing
situations she has noticed, among these the two users hesitat-
ing at the doorstep. She also describes, to the participants'
amusement, how the strategy of observing from the sidelines
totally broke down as she was approached by the talkative
users and she thereby became another observer than the one
who had arrived in the morning, a guest. She asks what these
observations might evoke about their encounters with the
users. One member of staff immediately says that it makes
him think of entering the living room of an elderly woman he
once made home visits to. From the moment he entered her
home, he could sense her condition, but he also knew that the
home changed when he entered. It was a home, but when he
crossed the doorstep, it became something more than a home.
The point that what it becomes depends on a number of cir-
cumstances is emphasized in the dialogue that follows: `for
example, how we physically approach the citizen', one mem-
ber of staff adds. Another situation is evoked by this discus-
sion: A participant who works at the activity centre tells
about a time he went to the sports hall with a group of users
of the activity centre. He recalls how he was struck by how
much entering the sports hall changed the contact among the
users and even his own way of approaching them. `At the
activity centre they sometimes can seem apathetic, and I
have to use all my energy to get them to be active. But here
another kind of energy was going through them', he adds. A
discussion emerges: The role of the social psychiatric team is
not to make users not-ill or less-ill, but rather `more-than ill'.
Hence, the point of the activity centre is to create a context in
which users can become more than their mental illness, all
the other things that they are apart from being ill, for exam-
ple, a chess player, someone who cooks or a basketball
player.
Entrance and space
The participants, previously sitting around the meeting table,
now go silently down the stairs that lead to the activity centre
in the basement. There is some awkwardness in this silence,
yet it seems to create a pause in which they sense the passage
from the meeting room into the activity centre. As they enter
the linoleum tiled room, one member of staff immediately
says, `Already here I notice that there's a certain smell in
here that I would always recognize'. They all pause and sniff
at the entrance, and others reply, `Yeah, you are in a com-
pletely different place now'. `A public institution', one says.
`Well, I smell dinner', another one adds. A third exclaims, `I
just got the thought that this is a difficult room to enter ­ it's
like a long, narrow tunnel seen from here'.
They are now standing at the doorstep where the two
users were standing, hesitating for a long time. The researcher
returns to how she was struck by the situation, when one of
the staff members approached the users, but stopped at a
distance of 5 m and waited for a long moment. Now, she goes
down the room and stops 5 m in front of the staff member,
who is still standing at the doorstep where the users hesi-
tated. `What made you stop here?' the researcher wonders
out loud. The staff member is not sure. `But it varies a lot',
another one adds, `Some users look for immediate contact'.
The group now tries, two by two, to approach each other and
then try to notice whether we feel we are being approached
too close, too fast or too hesitantly.
Entrance and habit
Two months later, this `slowing down'at the entrance is rein-
serted in another context: a working seminar with a munici-
pal office north of Copenhagen that was part of the same
research project. However, while the first `slowing down'
emerged spontaneously from the pause created by the (artifi-
cial) silence in which they entered the centre and thereby
intensified the event, this time the researcher tries purpose-
fully to recreate this slowing down. At the entrance of their
usual meeting room, she reads a piece from Calvino's
Invisible Cities, with which I started this article ­ to make
participants stop, wonder and slowdown in the habit of enter-
ing a meeting with their colleagues ­ in other words, to make
a pause in the continuity of expectations.
Then, how is the entrance of Penthesilea different than
what we habitually assume? The traveller continues his tale
in this way:
You advance for hours and it is not clear to you whether you are
already in the city's midst or still outside it. [...] If you ask the
people you meet, `Where is Penthesilea?' they make a broad
gesture which may mean `Here' or else `Farther on', or `All
around you' or even `In the opposite direction'. `I mean the
city', you ask insistently. `We come here every morning to
work'. Someone answers, while others say, `We come back here
at night to sleep'. `But the city where people live?' you ask. `It
must be that way', they say, and some raise their arms obliquely
toward an aggregation of opaque polyhedrons on the horizon,
while others indicate, behind you, the specter of other spires.
`Then I've gone past it without realizing it?' `No, try going on
straight ahead'.
Discussing `the how' of process
research from the example
Like the entrance of Penthesilea, the entrance of the centre is
not just a place that is already there; it only becomes an
entrance from someone having entered ­ it emerges from the
process of entering. And vice versa: The entrance actualizes
the one who enters the centre in a particular way. Certain
memories and experiences come to the surface (e.g. `dinner'
or `public institution') and actualize the user, the employee
and also the researcher in certain ways (e.g. as `hesitant',
`walking in a tunnel' or `a guest' that does not just observe
Pallesen 7
from the sidelines). Thus, `entrance' is constantly emerging
from relationally, materially, affective forces that entwine
with each other and affect us as a dynamic unity: the archi-
tecture of the building, the smell of the room and the sounds
in it resonate with the experience of those entering. Thus, the
entrance of the centre continuously comes into being in mul-
tiple ways. Hence, studying entrance as dynamic unity
implies opening up the qualitative multiplicity of the catego-
ries of those entering: how the citizen may `become other'
when he enters the centre (e.g. a `user' in the social psychiat-
ric system or a chess player), just like the researcher became
someone else than the person who arrived in the morning.
Thus, studying entrance, not simply as extensive passage
(a space that the user traverses) but as intensive passage (a
process of becoming-other), opens up the question, `How
does the space of becoming "more-than ill" emerge through
daily encounters?' Hereby, the theme of the resourceful user,
introduced by the manager in the introductory interview,
starts to deviate: Throughout the collaborative process, the
question is reframed from `How to implement an optic of the
user as being resourceful?' to `How the space for becoming-
other (more than ill) is actualized/enacted in daily life of the
centre?' In that sense, the return to the observation site
together with employees forefronts the genuinely processual
in the team's task ­ in terms of creating a space for the user's
multiple becomings: mentally ill, chess player, quiz winner,
basketball player, someone cooking Indian food and so on.
Hence, through this process, the observations at the
entrance become observations about how the `being place' is
entered as a `becoming place' ­ in other words, What are the
material, affective, bodily details of the event of entering the
centre that hold open this space of intensive movement/
becoming-other? Method here becomes a matter of finding
ways to be attentive to these entwined materially, bodily and
affective forces by which entrance into the centre actualizes
users and employees (and the researcher) in certain ways and
­ to relate to the multiplicity of it ­ the crowd of pressing
incipiencies that Massumi (2002) speaks of.
In the process described here, this was attempted in vari-
ous ways. One is by intervening actively by adding a drop
of `otherness', that is, introducing something artificial, cre-
ating a pause (`the awkward silence' or `the piece from
Calvino') that intensifies the event of entering and how it is
sensed. Another way, also conditioned by this `otherness',
is slowing down, partly by literally, physically slowing
down at the entrance when we return to the observation of
the users hesitating at the entrance. The sequence at the
entrance can be seen as a technic of `slowmotioning'(Beyes
and Steyaert, 2012), which allows us to zoom in on the mul-
tiple micro-life of the encounters that had just been in focus
in the meeting room. In other words, the physical slowing
down becomes a way to extend a piece of everyday life and
pay attention to what is more in it by slowing down our
perception of small everyday details, for example, how the
entrance emerges from the scent, sound and architecture of
the centre. A third way was repetition, that is, staying by the
event of entering and relating to it in different ways. The
observation of `the users hesitating at the doorstep' is here
multiplied by returning to this observation repeatedly in
ways that differ in form: First, the observation is made and
noted by the researcher; next, it is narrated at the meeting
with the team (where it opens up other narratives about
encounters with the users); then it is `relived' by actually
going back to the entrance, where it happened, where it
opens up an attention to the material, spatial aspects of
entering the centre. At last, it is reinserted into another con-
text. Thus, there is a series of `slowing downs', starting
from the two users slowing down at the entrance that opens
up to intensity and multiplicity.
`The how' of this small piece of process research could
therefore also be described as a process of slowing down,
intensifying and multiplying: First, there is a slowing down
at the entrance conditioned by a drop of otherness, which
intensifies and brings to the forefront sensations and feeling-
thoughts (Massumi, 2002, 2008) that are less likely to show
up in reflecting sessions and thereby opens up for multiply-
ing, that is, opening up to the qualitative multiplicity of the
categories involved. Thus, method here also becomes a ques-
tion of how to move beyond habitual practices of how we
approach the categories in focus. In line with Andrew
Murphie (2008), process research is arguably precisely not
about analysing habits and making them the basis of a new
taxonomy of experience but to `remake relations, changing
our habits as we go along' (Murphie, 2008: 11). Hence, it
somehow involves what Helin et al. call exposing ourselves
to the strange `that which invites us to open up and move
along lines of flight' (Helin et al., 2014: 9).
Rethinking existing methodological
concepts: documenting, variation,
validity
In the example discussed above, `documenting' takes on
another meaning than it has in the framework of correspond-
ence thinking, where documenting means capturing what is
there as precisely as possible. Massumi (2008) has reminded
us that we always perceive double: We see an object (e.g. a
chair), but we also see what we do not see (the back of the
chair, its weight, our body's capacity to move around the
chair or to stretch out the arm and feel the soft velour at the
hand). That is, we sense our own aliveness ­ the dynamic,
on-going, processual aspect of our relation to the object. In
process research, documenting is about finding ways of put-
ting that aliveness in front.
Thus, relating only to what we see is not something we
can do; we always see what we do not see, the city is multi-
plied by the experience of those entering, and it is always a
multiplicity of invisible cities. Process research is a call to
take this seriously in the practice of documenting ­ to relate
to what we `double see', to invoke the invisible and attend to
8 Methodological Innovations
the `aliveness' of the researched phenomena. That requires
methods that leave room for relating to the multiple registers
of sensation (Beyes and Steyaert, 2012; Dirksmeier and
Helbrecht, 2008; Pink, 2009). In the example above, doing
observations in many ways excesses the visual sense (Pink,
2009). Touching, hearing, smelling, tasting were also part of
being in the activity centre ­ sensations that are indivisible
and interpenetrating each other in experiencing a situation
and forms the sensation of being present, of being a part of its
liveliness. In Bergson's terms, they are a qualitative multi-
plicity that forms a dynamic unity of becoming.
To grasp the `realness'of the researched, we need ways of
documenting that does not immediately split apart that which
forms a dynamic unity in our experience of it just to recon-
nect it into generalizable descriptions and models that may
be ­ to use the words of Calvino's traveller ­ too probable to
be real. In the process discussed above, `documenting' what
happens rather means to put the liveliness of entrance in the
foreground ­ to forefront its changeability, its openness. It is
not so much about documenting the entrance that is already
there, but to connect to its multiple becomings, to invoke the
invisible entrance.
However, this has implications for how we can under-
stand the classic methodological categories of validity and
variation. In classic methodological thinking, `validity' basi-
cally means applying a transparent method that measures
what it claims to measure, which allows another researcher
to repeat the study with the same result. In qualitative
approaches, however, this concept of validity has been modi-
fied. For example, in Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss,
1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1997), validity means that the
study has inducted the core categories systematically from
the empirical material and that these categories are saturated.
In other words, data collection must continue until there is no
more variation in the categories. However, in process think-
ing, where the singularity of the experience is emphasized
and multiplicity is seen as fundamental, this reasoning
becomes problematic. Instead of searching for the point
where variation ends, validity would instead be a question of
actively pushing that point further.
As in the example above, that kind of `pushing' can take
different forms during the research process. It may be a ques-
tion of intervening by adding a `drop of otherness' to the
researched practices; it may be a matter of making series of
processings of the same piece of empirical material that takes
it through treatments that differ in terms of form, or it may be
a question of writing up empirical material in ways in which
the openness and ambiguity of the material are affirmed.
Hence, in methodological thinking from the perspective of
process philosophy, `repetition' becomes a way to stay with
the research object and multiply it, rather than a way of test-
ing whether the outcome stays the same.
However, this implies a fundamentally different way of
thinking about variation. In classic methodological thinking,
variation is a problem that is solved as a matter of statistical
significance (in quantitative methodology) or saturation of
categories (in qualitative methodology). However, in
Bergson's (2010) terms, one might say that both of these
ways of reasoning are extensive ways of thinking about vari-
ation, that is, variation between states and categories that are
separable and exclude each other in space. However, think-
ing of multiplicity as qualitative (i.e. indivisible, multiple
states interpenetrating each other) paves the way for another
way of thinking of variation: a fundamentally qualitative
way, namely, thinking of variation from within, as intensive.
One way to do this in empirical work is by welcoming the
notion that the same piece of empirical material comes into
being in multiple ways depending on the context it resonates
with and the experience of those involved. In the analysis
above, this is done by selecting a small piece of material that
is returned to repeatedly, but in different ways: for example,
as a narrative evoking other narratives, as a physical move-
ment, as the sounds, scents and architecture of the place
where it happened. Seen in this way, variation is not merely
variation between cases, practices or statements but also a
matter of revealing the variation immanent to the material ­
that is, of the places, situations and problems that we study
­ by repeatedly `documenting' it in different ways and
contexts.
Conclusion
Process thinking does not merely mean that movement and
vagueness are a complicating premise, something we have to
handle and take into account as a methodological challenge
in research. In this article, I have aimed at taking the more
radical point of departure that movement is the precondition
of studying anything at all: All things, to be noticed, must be
moving. That means that method becomes genuinely the task
of describing, understanding and expanding the ways in
which we connect with the world, how we connect with its
vagueness, movement and multiplicity, rather than a disci-
pline of techniques to disconnect from the world. I have sug-
gested here that moving further this `how'of process research
in organization studies and social science implies rethinking
central methodological categories like `documenting',
`validity' and `variation'. Hence, moving further in the field
of process research implies processualizing not only organi-
zational categories but also how we relate to knowledge.
This implies a methodological thinking that has room for
a more connotative, playful, way of relating to the material,
that does not demand from a methodology to overcome the
gap between what is there and what is captured, but makes
use of this gap as a space for invitation, rather than for impos-
ing, listing and classifying. This involves moving beyond
habitual practices of relating to knowledge; method is in that
sense inherently an `upstream practice' and involves what
Helin et al. call exposing ourselves to the strange `that which
invites us to open up and move along lines of flight' (Helin
et al., 2014: 9).
Pallesen 9
That upstreamness may, however, be threatened by its
own success. Put more precisely, there is always a risk of
ending up chasing more or less settled (agreed upon) markers
of `otherness', which over time may become an `over-coded'
form of strangeness, which ceases to be strange and therefore
changes no habits. In any case, it is not necessarily the very
`loud-mouthed' strangeness that enacts otherness. The sim-
ple activity of slowly entering a room in silence (a room you
have entered innumerable times at work, but not in silent
togetherness with colleagues that you are not used to being
silent together with) and suddenly becoming attentive to the
smell of the room can be a productive (but silent) stranger to
habit.
In this light, it is worth stressing that the how of process
research is a multiplicity of `hows'; the way of doing process
research discussed in this article is one way, as it emerged in
a corner of a research material generated in a specific con-
text. However, this does not mean that there is no room for a
common discussion about methodological concepts in a pro-
cess perspective. We may see method as `dead' or `empty',
but researchers will still encounter questions of a certain
(`methodological') nature when they go into the field and
afterwards when they present their findings in academic
papers or presentations. These are questions often silently
framed by methodological categories that have traditionally
been defined by correspondence thinking. In order to move
on and keep searching for the `hows' of process research in
organization studies, rethinking concepts such as validity
and variation through a processual lens might not only be
helpful for the researcher doing empirical studies in the field
of process research ­ but also may help create some space for
play in the field of methodology.
