Abstract Peershaveapowerfuleffectonadolescents'beliefs,
attitudes, and behaviors. Here, we examine the role of social
networks in the spread of attitudes towards sexuality using data
from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health). Although we found evidence that both sexual
activity (OR=1.79) and desire to have a romantic relationship
(OR=2.69) may spread from person to person, attraction to
same sex partners did not spread (OR=0.96). Analyses of
comparable power to those that suggest positive and significant
peer-to-peer influence in sexual behavior fail to demonstrate a
significant relationship on sexual attraction between friends or
siblings. These results suggest that peer influence has little or no
effect on the tendency toward heterosexual or homosexual
attraction in teens, and that sexual orientation is not transmitted
via social networks.

Introduction
Social influences play a crucial role in adolescent development
and behavior (Mednick, Christakis, & Fowler, 2010; Steinberg
& Monahan, 2007; Wolfe, Jaffe, & Crooks, 2006). For exam-
ple, adolescents are known to take more risks when in the pres-
ence of peers compared to solitary conditions (Gardner &
Steinberg, 2005). Early romantic relationships, representing
a key focus of adolescent development, are highly influenced
by peer relationships, at least among heterosexual peers (Fur-
man & Wehner, 1994, 1997). Friendship networks are fun-
damental to shaping the structure and quality of dating rela-
tionships during adolescence (Connolly, Craig, Goldberg, &
Pepler, 1999). For example, longitudinal research has found
that the number of other-sex friends in the 9th and 10th grade
predictedthelikelihoodthatadolescentswouldbeinaroman-
tic relationship by 11th grade, and the level of support and con-
flict in earlier friendships predicted the quality of these roman-
ticpartnerships(Connolly,Craig,Goldberg,&Pepler,1999).
In general, there is strong empirical evidence of associations
between peer influence and sexual activity in adolescents

(DeBlasio & Benda, 1990; Furstenburg, Moore, & Peterson,
1986; Jessor, Costa, Jessor, & Donovan, 1983). Peer groups
also influence adolescent sexual behaviors, including age of
sexual debut (Hair, Park, Ling, & Moore, 2009; Sieving, Ei-
senberg,Pettingell,&Skay,2006),frequencyofsexualactiv-
ity (DeBlasio & Benda, 1990), and safe sex acts (Catania,
Kegeles, & Coates, 1990; Fisher, 1988) such as consistent
condom use (Walter et al., 1992). A study using data from the
National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Harris,
2009) found that sexually inexperienced adolescents were
morelikelytohavehadsexualintercourse(definedasvaginal
intercourse) at follow-up if their peers were also sexually
experienced (Sieving, Eisenberg, Pettingell, & Skay, 2006).
Furthermore, a number of studies have shown that various
phenomena, such as smoking, obesity, alcohol use, loneliness,
depression, spread in adult social networks (Cacioppo, Fowler,
& Christakis, 2009; Christakis & Fowler, 2008a; Fowler &
Christakis, 2008; Rosenquist, Fowler, & Christakis, 2011;
Rosenquist,Murabito,Fowler,&Christakis,2010).Thiskindof
social network influence may be even more prominent in ado-
lescents(Mednick,Christakis,&Fowler,2010)giventheimpact
of social influence on their behavior. However, no studies have
directly examined the relationship between social networks and
thedevelopmentofsame-sexattractioninadolescents.Thus,itis
unclear whether social network influence generalizes to all
aspects of romantic and sexual relationship development or
applies only to specific behaviors and attitudes.
Most research on the development of early romantic rela-
tionships has focused on heterosexual relationships and there-
fore less is known about the development of same-sex romantic
or sexual relationships. There is limited evidence that the devel-
opmentoftheserelationshipsmaybedifferentfromthoseofhet-
erosexuals (Rotherbam-Borus, Reid, Rosario, & Kasen, 1995).
In contrast with strong peer influences on heterosexual activity,
Rotherbam-Borus et al. (1995) found no peer influence on gay
maleadolescentsexualbehavior.Fewhavefurtherexaminedthe
development of romantic or sexual relationships among same-
sex individuals; however, there exists a substantial body of lit-
erature which instead focuses on the origin of same-sex attrac-
tion.Same-sexorientationhasbeenrelatedtobiologicalfactors,
including genetics and neuroendocrine differences. Sexual ori-
entation appears to have a genetic influence (Bailey & Bell,
1993; Bailey & Benishay, 1993; Pattatucci & Hamer, 1995;
Pillard, 1990; Pillard & Weinrich, 1986); likewise, twin studies
have suggested genetic rather than family environment influ-
ences (Bailey & Pillard, 1991; Bailey, Pillard, Neale, & Agyei,
1993). Additionally, some evidence suggests that male sexual
orientationisinfluencedbyageneontheXchromosome(Hamer,
Hu, Magnuson, Hu, & Pattatucci, 1993; Hu et al., 1995),
although other studies have found contradictory evidence
(Bailey et al., 1999; Rice, Anderson, & Ebers, 1995). The neu-
roendocrine theory proposes that homosexual individuals have
been exposed to atypical levels of hormones in development,
resulting in sex-atypical neural differentiation (MacCulloch
& Waddington, 1981). In support of this perspective, LeVay
(1991) found that for one hypothalamic nucleus, gay men
were more similar to heterosexual women than to heterosex-
ual men. This study aims to contribute to the limited body of
knowledgeexaminingthedevelopmentofromantic orsexual
relationships among same-sex individuals, beyond these
more extensively studied biological factors.
In the present study, we used nationally representative data
fromAddHealthtoexaminewhethersame-sexromanticattrac-
tionsspreadthroughsocialnetworks,andwecomparedthis
effect to the spread of desire to have a romantic relationship and

Method
Participants
This study draws upon data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), a nationally repre-
sentative sample of students in Grades 7­12 (Harris, 2009). At
the beginning of Wave I, researchers identified an``in-school''
sample of 90,118 adolescents in 142 schools. A subset of this
group was then chosen for in-depth ``in-home'' follow-up in
Waves I (1994­1995), II (1996), and III (2001­2002). During
these in-home interviews, adolescents completed measures
about their social networks and health behavior, from which we
derivedourinformationaboutromanticandsexualrelationships
(N=14,738). The average age at baseline was 15.8years (SD
1.6), 51% were female, 23% Black, 17% Hispanic, and 7%
Asian-American (see Table1 for summary statistics).
The primary analyses reported here include only Wave I and
IIdata,sincebyWaveIIItheparticipantswereyoungadultsand
no longer embedded within their high school networks. How-
ever, we used Wave III data to validate the measure of same sex
attractionfromWavesIandII.Wetreatedeachfriendshipnomi-

Students were allowed to nominate up to five female and five
male friends and were then asked more specific details about

those friendships. Specifically, subjects were asked: (1)``List
yourclosestmalefriends.Listyourbestmalefriendfirst,then
your next best friend, and so on. Girls may include boys who
are friends and boyfriends.'' (2) ``List your closest female
friends. List your best female friend first, then your next best
friend, and so on. Boys may include girls who are friends and
girlfriends.''Subjects were also asked to name their siblings.

unique identifier for each named friend and sibling who was
also in the study.
Sexual activity was assessed by self-report at both waves by
answerstothequestion``Haveyoueverhadsexualintercourse?''
Subjectswereclassifieddichotomouslyassexuallyactiveifthey
answered``yes.''Sexual attraction was assessed by self-reported
answerstotwoquestions:``Haveyoueverhadaromanticattrac-
tion to a male?''and``Have you ever had a romantic attraction
to a female?''Subjects were classified dichotomously as being
attracted to same-sex partners if they said``yes''to the question
for their same sex. The validity of self-report of sexual behavior
is controversial (Schroder, Carey, & Vanable, 2003), but this
measureisfrequentlyusedinstudiesofadolescentsexualbehav-
ior(Rosenbaum,Rabenhorst,Reddy, Fleming,& Howells,2006).
Although our same-sex attraction measure was somewhat
crude, it was highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.67, SE ±
0.01, p\.001) with responses to a question administered at
Wave III assessing identified sexual orientation: ``Please
choose the description that best fits how you think about
yourself: (1) 100 % heterosexual (straight); (2) mostly het-
erosexual (straight),butsomewhat attractedtopeopleofyour
own sex; (3) bisexual` that is, attracted to men and women
equally; (4) mostly homosexual (gay), but somewhat attrac-
ted to people of the opposite sex; (5) 100 % homosexual
(gay).''Ideally, we would use this measure instead, but sub-
jects were no longer embedded in their high school networks
at Wave III. The high correlation with the earlier measure
provides evidence of predictive validity and suggests that
same-sex attraction captured much of the variation in self-
reported sexual orientation.
Finally, for comparison to the same-sex attraction measure,
wealsoevaluatedthedesireforanykindofromanticrelationship
withanswerstothequestion``Howmuchwouldyouliketohave
a romantic relationship in the next year? (1) Not at all; (2) Very
little; (3) Somewhat; (4) Quite a bit; (5) Very much.''We cate-
gorized subjects dichotomously as not desiring a relationship if
they responded``Not at all.''This cut-off resulted in a variable
withanincidenceof4.7%andthereforeyieldedatestwithsimi-
lar power to tests with the same-sex attraction measure, which
had an incidence of 4.6%.
Statistical Analyses
To establish whether friends exhibited correlated outcomes
in the networkat a singlepoint in time, we used a permutation
method.Here,wecomparedthePearsoncorrelationinobserved
values between all friendship pairs in the network to the Pear-
son correlation that resulted when we randomly permuted
those values while keeping the network intact. Repeating this
process 1,000 times gave us a distribution of the observed value
minus the random value, which we used to estimate confidence
intervals.
An association in the behaviors of connected individuals can
be attributed to at least three processes: (1) influence, whereby a
behavior in one person causes the behavior of others; (2) hom-
ophily, whereby individuals with the same behaviors preferen-
tiallychooseoneanotherasfriends(Christakis&Fowler,2013);
or (3) confounding, whereby connected individuals jointly
experience contemporaneous exposures (a sex education class
may make all students feel more comfortable expressing feel-
ings of same-sex attraction). Repeated measures of sexual
feelings or behavior, longitudinal information about network
ties,andinformationaboutthenatureordirectionoftheties(e.g.,
who nominated whom as a friend) help to distinguish these
effects (Christakis & Fowler, 2013; Liang & Zeger, 1986).
We conducted regressions of ego sexual behavior or feelings
in Wave II as a function of ego's age, gender, race, ethnicity,
household income, parental education, and sexual behavior or
feelings in Wave I, and of the sexual behavior or feelings of an
alter in both Wave II and Wave I. Inclusion of ego's behavior at
Wave I controls for ego's genetic endowment and any intrinsic,
stable predilection to have romantic feelings or to engage in
sexualbehavior.Includingalter'sbehavioratWaveIcontrolsfor
homophily.Ineachmodel,thecoefficientforthealteratWaveII
(e.g.,``alter attracted to same sex'') reflected the effect of social
influence controlling for other variables in the model. For a full
review of the literature on the advantages and limitations of this
method, see Christakis and Fowler (2013).

mous version of the outcome variable using generalized esti-

The GEE regression models in the tables provide parameter
estimates in the form of beta coefficients, which can be inter-
preted as log odds ratios. For clarity, we transformed these to
odds ratios in some parts of the text and in Fig. 2.
Finally, figures of networks were drawn using the free open-
source software Pajek (Batagelj & Mrvar, 2011).
Results
Figure1 depicts part of the network from a cluster of 123 con-
nectedadolescentsand,belowthese,permutationanalysesofthe
full sample. Figure1, on the left, also shows results of the anal-
yses examining the extent to which sexually active adolescents
tendedtobefriendswithoneanother.Therightsideofthefigure
shows the extent to which friends tend to have the same sexual
attractions. The correlation in sexual activity between friends
was significant at 0.17 (95% CI 0.11­0.16), and there was a
significantrelationshipbetweenfriendsoffriendsattwodegrees
of separation (0.05, 95% CI 0.02­0.07). However, we found no
evidence of such clusters among adolescents who reported
same-sex attraction. The correlation in these feelings between
friendswasnon-significant at 0.02(95% CI -0.01to 0.05), and
at higher degrees of separation the correlation remained non-
significant and close to 0.
These initial results represented a static analysis of a single
wave, but Add Health collected information at two different
wavesthatwasusedtomodelpeerinfluencedynamically.Results
of the first model (Table2) indicated that sexual activity was
significantly associated with a friend's answer to that question,
even after controlling for the previous behavior of both individ-
uals, sex, age, race, ethnicity, household income, and mother's
education. The odds of sexual intercourse increased by about
79% (95% CI 30­146%) for each friend who had had inter-

omized the variable to reflect those who said``Not at all''versus
all others. This dichotomy yielded a variable with very similar
incidence(4.7%)tothesame-sexattractionmeasure(4.6%).As
shown in Table3, we found a significant relationship whereby
each friend who desired a romantic relationship significantly
increased the odds of one's own desire by 169 % (95 % CI
9­561 %).
After demonstrating adequate power to detect the spread of
sexualbehaviorandthe desiretohaveromanticrelationships,we
testedtheprimarymodelsofinterest--thosepredictingsame-sex
attraction. As shown in Table4, romantic attraction to same-sex
partners did not spread--the coefficients were small and close to
zero, with odds ratios of 0.96 (95% CI 0.27­3.45) in a model
withoutdemographiccontrols,and0.97(95%CI0.25­3.35)ina
model with demographic controls. The confidence intervals on
these estimates were wide, but the baseline rates were also quite
low. Simulations of predicted values from the coefficient
covariancematrix(King,Tomz,&Wittenberg,2000)ofModel2
in Table4 suggested that the predicted baseline rate of romantic
attraction to same-sex partners among individuals with a friend
who was gay was 0.03 (95% CI 0.01­0.09) compared to 0.03
(95%CI0.02­0.04)forthosewithafriendwhowasheterosexual.
We also examined the spread of same-sex attraction in models
restricted to males, to females, to opposite sex friends, and to
same-sex friends (available from the corresponding author upon
request). In all cases, we found a similar pattern indicating non-
significant peer associations. Given that prior studies have found
the strongest social network effects between close friends
(Christakis&Fowler,2008a,2008b;Rosenquistetal.,2010),we
also investigated whether same-sex attraction spread between

named the other as a friend, but none of these models showed a
significant association.
Table 5 shows the results of the model examining whether
siblings influence same-sex attraction. Consistent with past
work on the genetic basis of sexual orientation, some of these
analyses indicated that a sibling's baseline disposition was
correlated with an adolescent's sexual orientation. However,
net of this baseline, we failed to find any evidence for social
influence in models with or without demographic controls.
We also restricted the sample to men, women, opposite-sex
siblings,andsame-sexsiblings,butnoneofthesemodelsshowed

Discussion
In a large, nationally representative, social-network sample,
we found that whereas sexual behavior may spread in ado-
lescent social networks, there was no evidence that same-sex
attraction spreads. These findings suggest that having friends
who are sexually active or who are interested in having roman-
tic relationships may influence an adolescent's own behavior
and attitudes, but this influence does not extend to the sex of
theobjectoftheseaffections.Wetestedavarietyofsocialnet-
work models and found no evidence that peers influence the
likelihood that adolescents have feelings of romantic attrac-
tion to same-sex partners. Although we demonstrated adequate
power to detect network effects on self-reported sexual behav-
ior and desire for a romantic relationship, similar analyses of
partner preference revealed no signs of peer influence. This
studyisthefirsttoexaminepeerinfluenceonsexualattraction
among both male and female adolescents from a longitudinal
dataset.These results suggest that changing attitudes towards
same-sex behavior in one's peers are unlikely to affect the
incidenceofsamesexrelationships,andthatadolescentswho
engage in or desire homosexual relationships have no effect
on the sexual attractions of their friends.
The peer influence model suggests that peers significantly
influence the behavior of other peers, including private or non-
public behavior, such as sexual activity (Catania et al., 1990;
Fisher, 1988). Social network effects on intimate sex-acts have
been demonstrated in numerous studies of condom use, con-
traceptionuse,andsexualriskbehavior(Alietal.,2011;Jackson
et al., 2011). However, this body of research largely examined
sexualbehaviorbetweenopposite-sexindividuals.Researchhas
shown that, unlike most heterosexual adolescents, gay male
adolescents may be more susceptible to peer influence with
regards to risky sexual behavior (DiClemente, 1991; Walter
et al., 1992). These findings suggest that gay adolescents may
follow a different developmental pathway when compared to
their heterosexual peers (Rotherbam-Borus et al., 1995).
This differing developmental pathway may, in part, stem
from problems with peer acceptance of differing sexual attrac-
tions or orientations. Gay adolescents may feel isolated from
their heterosexual peers as they are often subjected to harass-
ment, bullying, teasing, or even violence at school (Bos et al.,
2008; D'Augelli, 1989). Attitudes of adolescents towards sex-
ualminorities,andhomosexualityingeneral,arecomplicatedby
developing identities of religion, politics, race, and gender
(Calzo & Ward, 2009).
Previous research investigating environmental influence
on sexual development or orientation has focused primarily
on parenting or traumatic events in childhood. One prospec-
tive study found that adult men with a documented history of
childhood sexual abuse were more likely than matched con-
trolstoreporthavingsame-sexsexualpartners(Wilson&Widom,
2010), but that was not true for women, and no connections were
found between physical abuse or neglect andsexual orientation.
Similarly, another study of childhood sexual trauma found that
the effect of abuse was greater on the sexual orientation of men
than women and that causal relationships between abuse and
sexual orientation may be bidirectional and differ by sex and
type of abuse (Roberts, Glymour, & Koenen, 2013).
Likewise,inone of the most extensive studiescomparingthe
childhood experiences of homosexual and heterosexual adults,
Bell, Weinberg, and Hammersmith (1981) concluded that early
parenting experiences, whether positive or negative, had very
little direct influence on sexual orientation. Similarly, romantic
relationshipsandsexualbehaviorwerenotrelatedtofamilytype
in a study including adolescents parented by both same-sex and
opposite-sexcouples(Wainrightetal.,2004).Effectsofparental
sexualorientationonthatofchildrenalsoappeartobenegligible
between gay fathers and sons (Bailey et al., 1995) and between
lesbian mothersand their children(Golombok & Tasker,1996).
Bem (1996) suggested that childhood temperament, rather than
biological factors, determines preference for sex-typical or sex-
atypical activities, and these factors in turn influence sexual
orientation.Althoughthereissomeevidencethattheacquisition
of sex-typed behavior is associated with parental socialization,
thiseffectdiminishesbythepreschoolyears(Fagot&Leinbach,
1989).Incontrast,parentaltransmissionofnormsandmodeling
ofbehaviorappearstobeanimportantinfluenceonotheraspects
of sexual behavior (Bonell et al., 2006; Cavazos-Rehg et al.,
2010; Mott et al., 1996; Udry, 1988).
None of these non-biological explanations have attempted to
examine peer influence on sexual orientation or the effect of peer
networks on non-heterosexual romantic relationships, despite
knowledge that peer networks may be more powerful social
influences on adolescents than their parents. Add Health studies
haveshownthatthenumberoffriends,theageandgenderofthose
friends, and their academic performance all affect the onset of
sexual behavior (Cavanagh, 2004). Friends' religiosity also
affects whether adolescents report having sex and the effect was
strongestindensesocialnetworks,wheretheadolescents'friends
tend to be friends with one another (Adamczyk & Felson, 2006).
These studies demonstrate that sexual behavior can spread from
person to person and the impact of the network depends on how
tightly interconnected individuals are. Adolescents who believe
that their peers would look favorably on being sexually active
were more likely to have casual, non-romantic sex (Manning
et al., 2005). Engaging in oral sex with a partner can even make
one more popular among one's friends (Prinstein et al., 2003).
Romantic and sexual practices as diverse as contraceptive use,
analsex,fertilitydecisions,anddivorceareallstronglyinfluenced
by the existence of these behaviors within one's network
(Christakis & Fowler, 2009). By contrast, we have demonstrated
that sexual attraction during adolescence does not appear to be a
behavior that spreads through peer networks, consistent with
a biological determinant of same- or opposite-sex sexual
attraction.

The current study had several limitations. The way in which
sexualattractiontoasame-sexromanticpartnerwasdefinedmay
not adequately capture sexual orientation since sexual behavior
and identity are complex constructs that are often incongruent
(Savin-Williams, 2006). For example, having same-sex attrac-
tions or engaging in same-sex sexual experiences does not nec-
essarily mean that an adolescent identifies with a lesbian, gay, or
bisexualorientation(Blumenfield&Raymond,1993).Likewise,
adolescents who do identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, or who
may be romantically attracted to the same sex, may not have had
any sexual experience, same-sex, or otherwise (Savin-Williams,
2006; Ryan et al., 1998). Secondly, sexual orientation may be
more appropriately studied along a spectrum, rather than as a
static anddichotomous``gay''or``straight''construct.Giventhese
considerations, the continuous measure used at Wave III of our
data might have been more appropriate to study sexual identity.
However,ourevidenceindicatesthatthesemeasureswerehighly
correlated, suggesting that the measure was a relatively good
indicator of which youth would identify a same-sex romantic
orientation by early adulthood. Moreover, our measure cap-
tured adolescents who had same-sex attractions but had not
identified with a same-sex orientation. Nonetheless, our results
should be interpreted with these limitations in mind. An addi-
tional limitation of the study was that, despite the nationally
representative sample, only adolescents on high school rosters
were selected, and the initial assessment took place at school.
Therefore,thefindingsmaynotgeneralizetoyouthswhoarenot
attending school or chose not to participate.
Althoughwefoundevidenceamongyouththatbothsexual
behavior and feelings of romantic attraction may spread from
person to person, the desire to have a romantic relationship
with someone of the same sex (or opposite sex) does not
appear to spread. The absence of an effect of social networks
on sexual attraction may have important societal implica-
tions. Such a finding could also function as a``negative con-
trol''and hence help address a methodological debate in the
social network literature about whether statistical methods
for discerning influence are falsifiable (Christakis & Fowler,
2013; Cohen-Cole & Fletcher, 2008).
