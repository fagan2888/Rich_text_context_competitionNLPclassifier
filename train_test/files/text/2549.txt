Abstract
Studies conducted in Africa have demonstrated the existence of a significant association between
family environment and the sexual behaviour of adolescents. Generally, empirical studies of this
topic are based on parental control, and family or conjugal instability and socialization approa-
ches. The objective of this study is to assess the association between family environment and the
sexual behaviour of adolescents aged 12 to 19 years. The 2004 National Survey of Adolescents
(NSA) in Burkina Faso provides data for studying operationalization. Analyses were bivariate and
multivariate. The former were conducted using cross tabulations while the latter used three logis-
tic regression models. Results indicate a significant but low association among family environ-
ment variables. Absence of both parents, or a number of individuals under 20 years old higher
than the number of adults in a household is not systematically associated with risky sexual be-
haviour. Parental control was shown to be more discriminating of sexual behaviour of adolescents
from Burkina Faso, compared with communication with family members regarding sexuality. De-
spite current ongoing economic crises and sociocultural mutations in Burkinabe societies, house-
hold members and family still play major roles in adolescents' education. Results reinforce sexual
and reproductive health programs where parents and household members are central to strategies.

1. Introduction
Studies conducted in Africa have demonstrated a significant association between family environment and the
M. Yode, T. LeGrand

sexual behaviour of adolescents. The family environment has been considered from various viewpoints such as
type of residential arrangement at time of survey or during childhood, parents alive, parents living together,
parents' or guardians' marital status, living with grandparents, number of children in the household, and number
of siblings. These variables were constructed from data collected in households of residence at time of survey.
Most studies on this topic are characterized either by a limited definition of family environment or by leaving
aside mechanisms linking familial influence and the sexual behaviour of adolescents.
In several studies, only one variable, especially type of family (or type of household) is considered for family
environment. Studies by Tambashe and Shapiro [1], Rwengué [2] and Diop-Sidibé [3] looked at more than one
variable. In Sub-Saharan Africa, three main factors mark the socialization practices of adolescents: the house-
hold's human configuration, the fostering of children, and whether or not parents are alive. Operationalized fam-
ily environments that do not take these specifications into account might underestimate the scope of the associa-
tion that is likely to exist between family environment and adolescents' behaviour. This is the case for studies
carried out in Africa that focus essentially on comparing adolescents from two-parent families to those from
broken families, inspired by empirical studies conducted in the West [4] [5] that are based on theoretical ap-
proaches developed in the contexts of these industrialized societies.
Some studies that focus directly or indirectly on this issue [1]-[9] do not control for family mechanisms or
processes through which household members influence sexual behaviour. Such mechanisms combine relation-
ship and communication between parents and adolescents with parental monitoring. However, since the early
2000s, the trend has been to take these mechanisms into account [10]-[15]. This new direction in research is
possible because of the availability of data on family processes.
The pertinence of our study rests on the extent of risky sexual behaviours among adolescents as well as asso-
ciated health problems and unwanted pregnancies. According to the 2003 Demographic and Health Survey
(DHS) report for Burkina Faso, almost half of girls (48.4%) and more than a quarter of boys (26.2%) aged 15 to
19 have already had their first sexual relations [16]. During the most recent sexual relations of adolescents who
are single, 52.9% of girls and 38.6% of boys did not use condoms. Among adolescents who had had their first
sexual relations, 3.9% of girls and 11.5% of boys acknowledged having had an STI or symptoms of these infec-
tions. AIDS prevalence is 0.9% in girls and 0.7% in boys.
The high number of sexual health problems of Burkinabe adolescents is linked to the general context of lower
age at puberty and higher age at marriage [17] [18]. The longer period between puberty and marriage increases
the time of individuals who are exposed to sex outside marriage and to the related health, psychological, social
and economic consequences. In Burkina Faso, modern contraception is seldom chosen [19] [20], which does not
help reduce the frequency of these consequences.
Adolescence is also the period during which behavioural characteristics are developed and when it is possible
for adults to guide young people toward values that are socially acceptable [21] and that present fewer health
risks [22]. Parents, siblings and other relatives are mainly responsible for modeling behaviours. Hence, among
Burkina Faso's ethnic groups, particularly the Mossi majority, children are taught about couple relationships,
housekeeping, how to take care of children, appropriate attitudes towards members of society, and other issues
[23]-[25]. From early childhood, people are encouraged to internalize male or female values, attitudes and prac-
tices. In Africa, gender-based socialization is a determinant of sexual behaviours presenting health risks and
risks of pregnancy [26]. For example, education given to girls results in their being passive and submissive when
they are involved in intimate relationships [18].
The goal of this study is to evaluate the association between family environment and adolescents' sexual be-
haviour. In Burkina Faso, Akoto et al. [19] had previously recommended that such a study be undertaken.
However, only more recently did Karibu and Ezeh [14] followed by Biddlecom et al. [15] take this concern into
consideration in their research on adolescents in Burkina Faso and three other African countries. The specificity
of our study stems from the range of variables that we use to operationalize family environment and the fact that
we took family processes into consideration. Generally, empirical studies on this topic are based on three theo-
retical approaches: socialization, parental control, and family or conjugal instability. The approach of socializa-
tion considers adolescent behaviour to be dependent upon parent-child relationship and communication. In fami-
lies, biological parents are not the only ones who socialize adolescents [18] [27] [28]. Siblings, other adults and
grandparents living in the household can also be involved. According to the approach of parental control, par-
ents' objectives are to be aware of adolescents attitudes and behaviours and to monitor their activities so they
can discipline adolescents who engage in socially unacceptable behaviour [29]. It is considered that in situations
M. Yode, T. LeGrand
35
where parents are not together (single-parent families) or have remarried (blended families), parents spend less
time with adolescents and consequently provide less supervision. The approach of conjugal or family instability
emphasizes the situation of children in single-parent and blended families [30]. In these families, problems could
negatively affect parents' relationships with their children and their capacity to offer guidance and monitor ado-
lescents' activities. In Sub-Saharan Africa, it is more relevant to associate the situation of orphaned or fostered
adolescents with this theoretical perspective.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Data
The 2004 National Survey of Adolescents (NSA) in Burkina Faso provides data for the study. It looks at the
sexual and reproductive health of 12- to 19-year-old adolescents. The survey was organized by Institut National
de la Statistique et de la Démographie in collaboration with Macro International Inc. and The Alan Guttmacher
Institute [20]. It is part of a program of surveys conducted in three other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa: Ghana,
Malawi and Uganda.
The NSA is a nationally representative, stratified household survey. It included 5400 households taken from a
sub-sample of the 2003 Demographic Health Survey (DHS) enumeration areas, and covered populations resid-
ing in ordinary households. All adolescents aged 12 to 19 living in regular households were eligible to partici-
pate. In all, 5955 adolescents were surveyed: 49.4% girls and 50.6% boys.
Our study focuses on the evaluation of premarital sexual behaviours adopted by adolescents experiencing so-
cialization processes in family environments. To this end, the test sample does not consider adolescents who had
their first sexual relations after marriage. Also excluded are adolescents who first had sex before marriage but
lived with a partner at the time of the survey, and adolescents with the status of household caregivers. In the lat-
ter two cases, household of residence at survey would not correspond to socialization setting. In all, 7.2% of
adolescents were excluded from the analyses. They are mostly girls (90%), uneducated teens (80.8%) and ado-
lescents aged 18 to 19 years (66.4%) The final study sample is composed of 5458 adolescents, 976 of whom had
had sexual relations.
2.2. Variables
2.2.1. Dependent Variables
Sexual behaviours were measured by first premarital sex; among adolescents who had had premarital sexual
experiences, the behaviours measured were condom use at first sex, number of sex partners over the past 12
months, and systematic condom use during this period.
An adolescent's status regarding first sex (sexual relations with vaginal penetration) was determined with the
following question: When did you have sex for the first time (if you have ever had sex)? Using the imputation
method, data on age at first sex was defined for all adolescents who had initiated sex.
To assess condom use at first sex, the following question was asked: "When you had sex for the first time, was
a male condom used?" In the NSA questionnaire for adolescents, dozens of questions were asked regarding
sexual relations, partners and circumstances under which sexual relations occurred, in the past 12 months and in
the past 3 months. The data collected for this purpose are summarized by "number of sex partners" and "syste-
matic condom use" in the past 12 months. Adolescents who used a condom during all reported sexual relations
are considered as having used it systematically. The variable "systematic condom use" was constructed using
sexual relations in the past 12 months for girls, and sexual relations in the past 12 and past 3 months for boys.
Data on context of sexual relations in the past 3 months were collected only from boys, to assess systematic
condom use and its effectiveness.
A sexual behaviour presents a health risk when there is a greater likelihood of contracting sexually transmit-
ted infections or HIV, and of pregnancy at a young age and/or unwanted pregnancy. A sexual behaviour is risky
when at least one of the following conditions is met: first premarital sex at an earlier age than other respondents;
not using condoms at first sex; having had at least two sex partners in the past 12 months; or not systematically
using a condom during sexual relations in the past 12 months.
The operational definition of risky sexual behaviour is based on the one used by UNAIDS for the monitoring
and evaluation of national AIDS and sexually transmitted infections programs [31]. Categories for sexual be-
M. Yode, T. LeGrand
36
haviours defined as "risky" are based on a public health principles, which endeavour to get populations to adopt
desirable behaviours through prevention initiatives [32].
2.2.2. Independent and Control Variables
The definition and measurement of the concept of family environment include parents' reproductive and conju-
gal path and history, which are difficult to collect; this could explain the lack of interest in such a measurement
in standard survey operations that consider only household residence [33] [34]. Due to a lack of appropriate data,
researchers turn to household data. "Household" is defined according to residential unit and hierarchical links
among individuals [35], whereas "family" is based on blood relationship or marriage [36]. The tendency to use
household data to understand the family environment is designed to facilitate measurement of the concept of
family.
Family environment is represented by type of family household, parents alive, living with grandparents, and
ratio of people under 20 per adult in the household. Type of household of residence distinguishes people living
in the same household as the mother and father from those living with only the father or mother, or without the
parents. Parents alive are based on data pertaining to the biological mother or father still living. Cohabitation
with grand-parents refers to adolescents residing in households containing grand-parents and their grandchildren.
There can be one or several grandparents in a household. The ratio "number of people under age 20 per adult in
the household" indicates the availability of human resources for socialization of young people in a household.
Adults are defined according to age criteria, that is, people aged 20 or over.
Family processes are measured by using parents' level of control and having discussed sexuality with family
members. Parental level of control is an index constructed using principal component analysis (PCA) applied to
the database on parents' or guardians' knowledge of adolescents' nighttime outings, what adolescents do with
their free time, and who are the adolescents' friends.
There are three levels of parental control: low, medium and high. "Low level of control" includes mostly
adolescents whose parents or guardians are unaware of at least two elements (night spots, leisure activities or
friends), and those whose parents may be aware of all three elements. "High level of control" essentially in-
cludes adolescents who never go out and whose parents or guardians are aware of all leisure activities or know
their friends, and adolescents whose parents or guardians are always aware of all three elements. Separate level
of parental control variables are constructed for urban and rural settings.
The second family process variable captures the fact that an adolescent has discussed sexuality with family
members, that is, mother, father, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, cousin, grandmother, grandfather, or other. The ex-
act contents of this oral exchange on sexuality was not explored in NSA questions to adolescents.
Adolescents' sexual behaviour can also be determined by extrafamilial environment; this includes people of
all ages in the community who interact with the adolescent in community settings such as schools, religious or-
ganizations, social groups, social education and health centres, or simply neighbourhoods. It is a measure of the
social capital available to adolescents from the community [37] and that allows them to access information, de-
velop knowledge, attitudes, values and behavioural models. It is measured from the perspective of the adoles-
cent, according to level of education, participation in religious activities, belonging to social groups (association,
youth group or club), number of friends of the same sex, number of friends of the opposite sex, and having
talked about sexuality with someone from outside the family1.
Analyses in this study are controlled by a series of other variables: adolescent's ethnicity, place of residence,
age at survey, household wealth index, and head of household's level of education. The household wealth index
was constructed with PCA [38] using data on characteristics of the home, and household members' and house-
hold's assets, as well as facilities in the household. The variable is a proxy for the household's standard of living.
In analyses on sexually active adolescents' behaviour, many modalities of ethnicity and age at survey are reduc-
ed due to their small numbers.. Analysis pertaining to condom use at first sexual relation is controlled for age at
this event, without taking into account age at survey. Analysis of sexual behaviour in the past 12 months is con-
trolled for duration since initiation of sexual activity, which distinguishes adolescents who initiated sexual activ-
ity in the past 12 months from those who did so more than 12 months ago. The variable stems from the differ-
ence between an adolescent's age in months at time of survey and approximate age in months at first sex. Multi-
plying age at first sexual relation by 12 yields this approximation.
1It is the fact of having discussed sexuality with friends, boyfriends or girlfriends, teachers, health professionals, religious leaders, or others.

2.3. Hypotheses
· A family environment comprised of both parents in the household, both parents alive, grandparents, or indi-
viduals under age 20 fewer than adults in the household is less likely to be associated with risky sexual beha-
viour.
· Having discussed sexuality with family members or greater parental (or guardian) control is less likely to be
associated with risky sexual behaviour.
· The relationship between family environment or family processes and sexual behaviour depend on the ado-
lescent's gender.
2.4. Methods
Analyses were bivariate and multivariate. Cross-tabulations were used for bivariate analyses. Significance of
associations between variables was assessed using chi-squared test at a threshold value of 0.05. Multivariate
analyses were conducted according to three variants of logistic regression, based on dependent variable catego-
ries: discrete-time survival analysis using logistic regression (onset of premarital sexual relations), dichotomous
logistic regression (condom use at first sex and systematic use in the past 12 months), and ordered logistic re-
gression (number of sex partners in the past 12 months). Availability of data on age at first sex determined the
use of discrete-time survival logistic regression to analyse first sex. To apply this method, the "episode" data file
must first be changed into a "person-years" data file. Weighted data were used for the analyses. Mulitivariate
analysis results are considered according to a maximum significance threshold of 0.10.
The NSA sample design consisted of interviewing a number of 12- to 19-year-olds living in households. Lo-
gistic regression involved the assumption of adolescents' independence; this hypothesis cannot be verified in the
case of the behaviours of adolescents from a same household. The same applies to analyses of person-years,
which are elements in an adolescent's history. To control the correlation of observations and improve the robust-
ness of standard errors, we used the "cluster" option in Stata for analyses involving two levels (adolescent and
household), and a multilevel analysis with a random intercept for cases involving three levels (person-years,
adolescent and household) using Stata 10.0 with the command xtmelogit.
3. Results
3.1. Adolescents' Sexual Behaviour
An exploration of dependent variables by sex (Table 1) provides insight into the sexual behaviour of boys and
girls. Overall, 18.4% of Burkinabe adolescents reported having premarital sexual relations. Median age at first
sex for boys and girls in our sample is 18.9 years, and was obtained from the survival table. According to adults
in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, it is more common these days for young people to have sex outside marriage
than when they were young themselves [39]. This point of view is consistent with the conclusions of scientific
studies that puberty occurs at a younger age and age at marriage is rising, and thus sexual initiation of adoles-
cents is more likely to be premarital. Yet, in the values of most ethnic groups in Burkina Faso, sexual relations
occur within marriage [20] [23].
Among sexually active adolescents, 34.5% reported using a condom the first time they had sexual relations.
Girls were proportionately more numerous than boys to report using a condom at first sex (39.8% vs 30.9%).
The condom is the contraceptive [19] [20] Burkinabe adolescents were most familiar with and the one they used
the most. Its use at first sex was quite low, a reflection of several realities. Part of this finding can be explained
by the trust partners had in each other, which justified their desire to have sexual relations. A second explanation
is the cost and accessibility of condoms. Admittedly, the cost of condoms has gone down and its geographical
accessibility has risen. But for a Burkinabe adolescent under 20 years of age with no source of income, it can be
difficult to find the 50 or 100 CFA francs needed to by a pack of four condoms. Even when there is money, they
have to be daring to go to a neighbourhood store to purchase condoms, and risk being judged by the shopkeeper
and the entire neighbourhood.
In the past 12 months, 9% of adolescents who had initiated sex reported having had more than one sex partner,
and 31.1% said they had systematically used a condom during sexual relations. Proportionately more boys than
girls reported having had more than one sex partner (12.9% of boys, 3% of girls). Conversely, fewer boys than
girls stated having systematically used condoms (27.5% vs 36.7%). In the Burkina Faso context of low condom

use, the number of sex partners over the past 12 months could indicate sexual situations with potential health
risks. We can assume that numerous adolescents who had had more than one sex partner in the past 12 months
did not use condoms systematically.
Sexual behaviour varies significantly by gender, thus reflecting differences in the socialization processes of
adolescents of both sexes. Girls are subject to significant control by family and community members, which
limits their propensity to initiate sexual activity at a young age. Such social control persists while girls remain in
a family environment under adult guardianship. They are constantly warned against out-of-wedlock pregnancies
and the familial and social consequences that would ensue.
Out-of-wedlock pregnancies are a major social problem in Africa [40] [41]. According to Burkinabe adults,
cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies are common among families [42]. Their consequences cause permanent
concerns for the families [21] [43]. Teen pregnancy can lead to dropping out of school, abortion, premature birth
or to compromising a girl's prospects for marriage. A pregnant young girl can also be rejected by her family and
socially marginalized.
3.2. Variables Associated with Adolescents' Sexual Behaviour
Table 2 shows the results of multivariate analyses conducted by sex. These are estimated coefficients in regres-
sion models for first premarital sex (columns 2 and 3), condom use at first sex (columns 4 and 5), systematic
condom use in the past 12 months (columns 6 and 7), and number of sex partners during this period (columns 8
and 9).
3.2.1. First Sex
Family environment is significantly associated with girls' first sex, through type of family household. Absence
of both parents from the household is associated with early first sex, compared with girls living with their two
parents.
Among family process variables, level of parental control is associated with first sex of boys and girls. Me-
dium or high level of control is associated with later first sexual intercourse. Having discussed sexuality with
family members is associated with early first sex.
As for variables related to extrafamilial environment, results show that girls in high school are more likely to
delay first sex. Boys who reported not belonging to a religion are more likely to have sexual intercourse at a
young age. Belonging to social groups is associated with early first sex among girls. Having a higher number of
friends of the same sex reduces the probability of early first sex among boys. A higher number of friends of the

opposite sex and having talked about sexuality with someone outside the family are associated with early first
sex among boys and girls.
In the control variable categories, ethnicity, age at time of interview and level of education of the head of
household are associated with initiation of sexual activity among boys and girls. Place of residence is associated
in the model for boys, and household wealth index for girls.
3.2.2. Behaviours of Adolescents Who Had Initiated Sexual Activity
Results shown in Table 2 demonstrate a significant association between family environment and the behaviours
of boys and girls who had initiated sexual relations. Boys who do not live with their parents are less likely to use
condoms at first sex, compared with boys in two-parent households. Girls in the latter type of household are
M. Yode, T. LeGrand
41
more likely to use condoms at first sex. Among girls, living with their mothers is likely to be associated with
condom use at first sex, systematic condom use in the past 12 months, and having more than one sex partner
during this period. An increase in the number of individuals under 20 years old per adult in the household is
more likely to be associated with girls' condom use at first sex, and less likely to be associated with boys' sys-
tematic condom use in the past 12 months.
Parental control is associated with boys' and girls' behaviours, whereas having discussed sexuality with fam-
ily members is only associated with girls' behaviours. High parental control over girls is associated with condom
use at first sex, whereas medium parental control is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use over
the past 12 months. Medium or high parental control over boys and medium control over girls is less likely to be
associated with having more than one sex partner. Girls who had discussed sexuality with family members were
more likely to report having used a condom at first sex.
Significant associations are observed between extrafamilial environment variables and the behaviour of ado-
lescents who had initiated sexual relations. Boys and girls in high school are more likely to use condoms at first
sex. Girls in elementary and high school are more likely to have systematically used condoms in the past 12
months. For boys, going to high school is associated with a low probability of having more than one sex partner.
Boys who do not adhere to a religion are less likely to use a condom at first sex; girls who participate in reli-
gious activities are less likely to have systematically used condoms in the past 12 months. Among boys, an in-
crease in the number of friends of the same sex reduced the probability of having had more than one sex part-
ner over the past 12 months. An increase in the number of friends of the opposite sex is associated with syste-
matic condom use over the past 12 months among boys and girls, and, for boys, with having had more than one
sex partner. Lastly, boys and girls who reported discussing sexuality with someone outside the family are more
likely to have had more than one sex partner in the past 12 months.
Among control variables, ethnicity is not significantly associated with girls' behaviours. Age at survey and
household wealth index are not significantly associated with boys' behaviours.
4. Discussion
Analyses reveal a weak, sex-differentiated association between family environment and sexual behaviour. "Par-
ents alive" and "living with grandparents" are not associated with sexual behaviour indicators. No new results
emerged from looking at the joint effects of the variables that operationalize family environment. Our results in-
dicated that adolescents living with both parents did not have safer sexual behaviours than those living in other
types of households.
The absence of both parents in the household is not systematically associated with risky sexual behaviours in
girls who lived with their mothers only or who did not live with their parents. Girls who lived with their mothers
and without their fathers are more likely to have had several sex partners than their counterparts living with both
parents. However, they had a greater propensity to use condoms at first sex and in the past 12 months. This re-
sult runs somewhat counter to that of Biddlecom et al. [15]. These authors observed that Ghanaian girls living
with their mothers were less likely to have used a contraceptive method at most recent sexual relation. But that
study focused on contraception in general, which limited the scope of comparison. Our study findings enable us
to qualify the hypotheses that adolescents residing with their mothers are more likely to adopt risky sexual be-
haviours [44] [45]. At the very least, this hypothesis holds for having several sex partners. Mothers are closer to
their daughters and more likely to listen to them and act as confidantes. This relationship of trust predisposes
girls to better internalize the advice given by their mothers on risks linked to sexuality. While girls in these
households have more partners, a sign of having a certain amount of freedom, their tendency to use protection is
an indication of their concerns regarding risks of unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections.
Analyses demonstrate that girls who did not live in households with both their parents were more likely to
engage in early first sex than their counterparts living in two-parent households. This result is similar to the
findings of Karim et al. [11] in their study in Ghana, where unmarried girls aged 12 to 24 who did not live with
both their parents were more inclined to initiate sexual relations. Girls who do not live with both parents are en-
trusted to somebody's care. Their propensity to have sexual intercourse at an early age is a consequence of the
heads of households' discriminatory practices when caring for children they have taken in [46] [47]. Unlike the
children of heads of households, these girls get very little emotional, material and financial support. They have
male companions to compensate for this lack of support. Results also show that a condom is more likely to be
M. Yode, T. LeGrand
42
used at first sex, indicating better knowledge of the health and social consequences of having unprotected sex.
Unlike girls, boys living in this same type of household do not have such knowledge or, at the very least, such
awareness. They are less likely to use a condom at first sex.
According to social capital hypotheses [48], a higher number of children in a household reduce the attention
and affection parents give to each child, and therefore are likely to be associated with risky sexual behaviours.
Results for boys fit this hypothesis. An increase in the number of individuals under 20 years old per number of
adults in the household is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use in the past 12 months. This is
not the case for girls. Girls who live in this type of household are more likely to use condoms at first sex. A
greater number of children and adolescents in a household is synonymous with greater proximity and better in-
teraction among them [28] [49]. It is easier for girls who live most of their adolescence inside the household to
find someone among the other young people to talk about sexuality and its consequences. The inverse is ob-
served among boys. Such closeness encourages them to value unprotected sex.
Results related to parental control support our study hypothesis. Parental control is associated with later first
sex, with having fewer than two sex partners in the past 12 months for boys and girls, and with condom use at
first sex for girls. These findings are in line with the results of other studies which have shown that parental con-
trol is less likely to be associated with sexual relations in the past months [13] [15] and more likely to be associ-
ated with using a condom at most recent sexual relation [50]. However, our study demonstrates that parental
control is less likely to be associated with systematic condom use in the past 12 months. This result can be ex-
plained by an inverted relationship between parental control and sexual behaviour. It is likely that higher paren-
tal control follows from adolescents' adoption of a type of behaviour.
The hypothesis of the protective effects of adolescents and family members discussing sexuality is partly
borne out. The fact of having discussed sexuality is associated with girls' condom use at first sex. Similar to pa-
rental control, the effects of the last variable also suggest inverse causality. A predisposition of household
members or of adolescents to talk about sexuality could result from an adolescent's sexual activity. For instance,
boys who initiated sex at an early age where more likely to report having talked about sexuality with family
members. Babalola et al. [12], Kumi-Kyereme et al. [13] and Biddlecom et al. [15] obtained similar results.
Compared with parental control, the variable operationalizing communication is nonetheless weakly associ-
ated with sexual behaviour. It is important to note the low accuracy of the data used to operationalize communi-
cation. The indicator variable was constructed using answers to the following question: Did you talk about is-
sues related to sexuality with any family members? If the answer was Yes, a second question was asked: With
whom did you talk about it? Results demonstrate that within households, monitoring adolescents and their ac-
tivities is more commonly used by parents and guardians [20] [51]. Whether control is exercised prior or subse-
quent to adolescents' adopting a behaviour, these results uphold the evidence indicating a preference for moni-
toring adolescents.
The relationship between type of family and sexual behaviour differs according to sex. This result can be
compared to those of Karim et al. [11] and Biddlecom et al. [15]. In the first study, there is an association be-
tween type of family and first sex for girls. No significant association was observed between type of family and
first sex for boys. In the second study, type of family is associated only with Ghanaian and Ugandan girls' sex-
ual behaviour. Sociocultural context explains the variations in results by gender. In Burkinabe societies, because
of the importance given to girls' virginity before marriage and management of the consequences of out-of-wed-
lock pregnancies, household members pay greater attention to girls' sexuality.
5. Conclusions
The results support the hypothesis of a link between extrafamilial environment and sexual behaviour of adoles-
cents. They highlight the importance of extrafamilial institutions, especially modern schools and religious de-
nominations in adolescents' socialization. In Burkina Faso, parents recognize that adolescents are more predis-
posed to listen to a teacher's advice rather than their own [23].
Despite current ongoing economic crises and sociocultural mutations in Burkinabe societies, the family still
plays a major role in adolescents' education. More discriminating aspects are the presence or absence of the fa-
ther and/or mother in the household and parents' or guardians' control over adolescents, with regard to sexual
behaviour. Fear of parental authority, advice and warnings, as well as psychological, emotional, financial and
material support from family members limit the propensity for early sex and unprotected sexual relations.

Results provide arguments that support using household data to examine the relationship between family en-
vironment and adolescents' behaviours. They reinforce sexual and reproductive health programs that place par-
ents and family members at the centre of strategies [52]. The ease with which households can be located, com-
pared with families, makes it easier to operationalize these strategies.
