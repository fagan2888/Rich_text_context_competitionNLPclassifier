Abstract
Massive Open Online Courses appear to have high attrition rates, involve students in peer-
assessment with patriotic bias and promote education for already educated people. This paper
suggests a formative assessment model which takes into consideration these issues. Specifically,
this paper focuses on the assessment of open-format questions in Massive Open Online Courses.
It describes the current assessment methods in Massive Open Online Courses and it argues that
self-assessment should be the only way of formative assessment for the essays of xMOOCs and
replace the peer-assessment.

Introduction: Assessment in Massive Open Online Courses
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become increasingly popular over the last
decade (Jordan, 2015). They are called `massive', in relation to the number of registered
students, and `open', because the course content is free of charge. They can be accessed
online and they are courses since they have a specific structure with a definite material to be
studied (Siemens, 2013).
This paper focuses on the assessment in MOOCs. Assessment is an important topic to be
examined because it can be a powerful learning tool even in the case of MOOCs. Boud and
Falchikov (2007: 3) argued that `assessment, rather than teaching, has a major influence on
students' learning'. They supported that assessment has an impact on what learners do and
how they do it, whilst it can help them understand what they can or cannot do. Additionally,
assessments can have positive or negative `washback', which means that they can have
impact on students' learning and motivation. Therefore, the relationship between assess-
ment and learning should be examined (Baird et al., 2017), since assessments can both
measure and support learning. Furthermore, the assessment can be considered a learning

event. Testing what is learnt is more likely to lead to the retention of knowledge in memory
compared to restudying the same material (Halamish and Bjork, 2011). Therefore, this
paper focuses on the assessment as an important part of the learning process in MOOCs.
Since there are thousands of MOOCs, it is not possible to examine each course individ-
ually. This paper scrutinises the assessment for xMOOCs, which are MOOCs `offered in
a traditional university model' (Siemens, 2013: 7). Two popular examples of platforms
offering xMOOCs are Coursera and EdX. There are xMOOCs which can be evaluated
with multiple-choice items or computational activities. These activities can be automatically
graded by a computer in a reliable way. However, for some MOOCs open-ended questions
or essays are used as a preferable assessment method since it is debatable whether multiple-
choice items evaluate particular high-order skills as effectively as open-response questions
(Bennett et al., 1991; Hancock, 1994).
Undoubtedly, it is infeasible to involve tutors in assessing thousands of open-response
assignments (Koller, 2012), since MOOCs are massive and hundreds to thousands of stu-
dents can take each of these courses (Siemens, 2013). For this reason, EdX uses a system
called Automated Essay Scoring (Balfour, 2013). This system has been criticised as being
restricted to grading based on superficial factors, lacking the ability to point creativity,
humour or sarcasm (Zhang, 2013) and not being able to assess the texts in the same way
as human assessors (Balfour, 2013). Therefore, it is questionable to what extent computer-
based assessment could evaluate the assignments of the students. Hence, it has been found
that there is a need for human assessors.
Since it is infeasible to have the assignments of thousand students corrected by the uni-
versity tutors, both Coursera (2016) and EdX (2016) use peer-assessment and self-
assessment when a course demands a written assignment to evaluate the large number of
assignments. Specifically, Coursera uses a calibrated peer review assessment system. In the
calibrated peer review, the students initially mark some assignments which have been pre-
viously marked by the instructor. The system checks the agreement between the instructor
and the student grade and it calibrates the grades given by the students. According to the
extent of the agreement, the students are attributed a Reviewer Competency Index. Then,
when the students grade the assignments of their peers, this grade can be considered more or
less crucial for the final grade of their peer according to the Reviewer Competency Index
(Balfour, 2013).
During peer-assessment, students grade the assignments of four or five of their peers
using a rubric and they also have their assignment graded by the same number of peers.
Some courses offer the option of self-assessment. If students self-assess their work from the
course, they do it by using the same rubric after having completed the peer-assessment.
Nevertheless, in EdX for the open-response assignments when students are both peer- and
self-evaluated, they are awarded only the peer grade and the self-assessment is not taken into
account (EdX, 2016). This implies that self-assessment is underestimated to some extent.
Even though the feedback remains formative, self-assessment could contribute equally.
Assessments in Coursera and EdX can be either summative or formative. Assessment for
Learning or formative assessment intends to support learning, while summative assessment
is associated with grading, certifications and accountability (Gardner et al., 2010). When
users are registered in a course in Coursera or EdX, they can choose between two routes.
They can either choose the direction which will lead them to a certification or to simply audit
the course. Thus, the summative assessment could be defined as the type of assessment
which is focused on certification. In this case, learners are required to pay a fee to gain a
166 E-Learning and Digital Media 15(4)
certificate on both platforms. The option of auditing the course for free is also provided to
the students. In this case, students can still complete the assessments to examine their level of
knowledge, understand what they have to improve and promote their learning. This latter
case is considered as formative assessment and it is the type of assessment on which this
paper focuses.
Specifically, this paper focuses on formative assessment, because the second route corre-
sponds to the needs of the majority of learners registered in MOOCs. Shrader et al. 2016
asked participants, who were registered in different courses, the reasons why they were
taking these MOOCs. The study found that only a small percentage of participants
(3.3%) were registered in MOOCs in order to gain a course certificate. The majority of
the participants reported the broadening of knowledge (65.6%), and the curiosity and gen-
eral interest for the topic (35.6%) as prime motivation to take a MOOC. Similarly, Salmon
et al. (2017) found that the motivation of MOOC students is mostly intrinsic. Furthermore,
Barak, Watted and Haick (2016) reported high ratings in intrinsic motivation of the MOOC
learners in their study. Therefore, the majority of the students who participate in a MOOC
appear not to pursue a certification, but they are merely interested in the learning of the
MOOC content. Hence, it becomes apparent that formative assessment, which supports the
students to evaluate their own learning, could be considered more meaningful for the major-
ity of MOOC learners compared to the summative assessment, which is focused on the
accreditation.
Finally, despite the high number of registered students, MOOCs appear to have high
attrition rates and low engagement. Even though the success of the courses should not
necessarily entail completion (Pursel et al., 2016), these are indicators that enhancement
should take place concerning several aspects of MOOCs. This paper tries to address these
issues by examining the best possible way of assessment for these courses. In the following
sections, the reasons why peer-assessment in MOOCs should be abandoned and how self-
assessment could possibly provide a solution for the improvement of the MOOCs experience
is discussed.
Peer-assessment and interaction
Peer-assessment does not appear to be implemented in the most ideal conditions in the case
of MOOCs. A meta-analysis with peer-assessment articles published in the last 15 years
(Li et al., 2016) found that peer-assessment appears to be more correlated to the teacher
assessment when it is paper- instead of computer-based. Moreover, the same meta-analysis
showed that this correlation is higher when peer-assessment is voluntary. In the case of
Coursera and EdX, the peer-assessment is computer-based and compulsory and its comple-
tion is pre-requisite for the students to have their own marks returned. Last but not least,
peer-assessment is more accurate when the students participate in the creation of the rating
criteria (Li et al., 2016). This is definitely not the case in the MOOCs when the scoring rubric
is given to the students.
Peer-assessment in MOOCs can be argued to be beneficial for the students when they
reflect on and evaluate the work of their peers (Comer and White, 2016). However, peer
feedback is heavily criticised in MOOCs. Particularly, peer feedback in Coursera has been
heavily criticised due to the fact that it is anonymous and it does not incorporate a check for
plagiarism (McEwen, 2013). Further, peer feedback in Coursera has been accused of being
inconsistent with a lack of feedback on the peer-assessment itself (Watters, 2012). Thus, the
Ventista 167
learners do not always appear satisfied by the peer feedback received. Concurrently, almost
half of the participants in a large-scale survey supported that they put a lot of effort to
evaluate their peers, but they feel that the peers do not comprehend their work (Kulkarni
et al., 2013). Meanwhile, the peer-assessment is questioned concerning its trustworthiness by
the students (Floratos et al., 2015).
As a result, the evidence for the use of peer-feedback in MOOC is not encouraging for the
continuation of implementation of this assessment. Lee and Rofe (2016) found that the peer
interaction in MOOCs does not play a role in the final grade of the students. Additionally,
research with MOOC participants revealed negative correlation between the students' perfor-
mance and the extent to which they prioritise interaction with their peers (Phan et al., 2016).
However, if peer-assessment is abandoned, it is likely that social interaction in MOOCs would
be reduced. This might be problematic since the social interaction as a crucial factor for the
learning process has been emphasised by educators, such as in the zone of proximal develop-
ment of Vygotsky (1978). Nevertheless, the students who participate in MOOCs can still be
offered the choice of peer interaction. This does not have to occur during the process of peer-
assessment. The students could still interact through peer forums.
After demonstrating that the research findings do not fully support the implementation of
peer-assessment and the benefits of peer interaction, the following section will demonstrate
how self-assessment could potentially address crucial issues in MOOCs which peer-
assessment fails to solve and address.
The current issues in MOOCs
As it has been discussed, the learners sometimes appear unsatisfied with the implementation
of peer-assessment in MOOCs. There is a need to correspond better to the needs of the
learners, and platforms providing MOOCs have still crucial matters to consider. Specifically,
the issues that MOOCs face are high attrition rates, patriotic bias emerging in peer-
assessment and the lack of providing accessibility to all the learners. This paper argues
that self-assessment as an only assessment method which could correspond more effectively
to each of the issues appearing in MOOCs and to the learning needs of the MOOC students
compared to the current assessment method.
High attrition rate
One of the main problems in MOOCs is the high dropout rate. Jordan (2015) examined 221
MOOCs and she found that the completion rate varies from 0.7 to 52.1%. Specifically, the
courses using peer grading or a combination of peer grading and autograding were com-
pleted by less than 10% of the students who were enrolled. On the other hand, courses with
autograding were usually completed by more than 20% of students. Therefore, she con-
cluded that courses with peer grading have high attrition rates. The use of autograding could
be a solution, but not all the courses can be evaluated with autograding and multiple-choice
items. Thus, the investigation of an assessment method to reduce the attrition rates for
open-ended questions is crucial.
What is more, a recent survey identified (Nawrot and Doucet, 2014) that among
12 sample reasons more than 50% of the participants chose time as a reason for withdrawal.
Specifically, by `time' the authors meant `time organisation, real life responsibilities and too
much time consuming course' (Nawrot and Doucet, 2014). The participants argued that
168 E-Learning and Digital Media 15(4)
they lack time and hence they decided to quit. Subsequently, in order to reduce the attrition
rates, MOOCs should implement less time-consuming assessment methods.
Time as a factor could also explain why Jordan (2015) found out that courses implement-
ing peer-assessment are having the highest attrition rates. Peer-assessment can be extremely
time-consuming as it demands from the students to grade at least four assignments of other
students. Meek et al. (2016) used a survey in a MOOC to investigate the appropriateness of
peer review. Their findings are in line with the argument that peer review is a time-
consuming method. They found that women with full-time jobs were less likely to be
involved in peer review process, while students retired by their jobs tend to complete
the peer review the most. As a result, the authors also concluded that the time constraint
can be a dispiriting factor for students to be involved in peer review process. Likewise, the
combined peer- and self-assessment can be time-consuming. On the other hand, it takes less
time for the students to grade only their own assignments. Consequently, self-assessment
can correspond better to the needs of the MOOC learners as they appear to regard time as
an important factor for their participation in the course.
Rating bias in peer-assessment
Bias is an important factor to be considered when the quality of an assessment framework is
judged. A test is regarded as fair and unbiased when it does not attribute differences in
different groups, when these differences do not exist, or do not attribute larger or smaller
differences in the test than the differences which exist in reality (Hunter and Schmidt, 1976).
Koretz (2008) argued that it is not the test itself which can be (un)biased, but a test inference.
Assessment in MOOCs should not promote biased inferences. MOOCs are open to people
from different social, economic and cultural backgrounds. Hence, MOOCs have immense
diversity concerning their students. However, Kulkarni et al. (2013: 15) identified `patriotic
grading' which means that students tend to grade higher the students who come from the
same country. Thus, peer-assessment in MOOCs appears to be biased. On the other hand,
self-assessment can provide a solution to the rating bias found by MOOC research since it
will leave no space for the patriotic bias. In research for self-assessment, students were found
to agree that self-assessment is `fairer' because it enables them to include complementary
performance dimensions, such as effort (Ross et al., 1998). It is likely that self-assessment
can reduce bias deriving from the diverse background of the participants in MOOCs.
During self-assessment the students do not have the opportunity to promote bias regarding
their peers, since they are only evaluating their work and they are aware of their own
background, effort and learning goals.
Education not accessible to all
The most important element to be considered is probably who can access MOOCs. Even
though MOOCs are promoted as a way of promoting `education for all' and making the
education accessible to everyone, research evidence has shown that the courses are usually
taken by educated and employed people coming from developed countries (Christensen
et al., 2013; Eichhorn and Matkin, 2016; Kulkarni et al., 2013). Furthermore, the MOOC
participants who hold a master or a PhD degree are twice more likely to complete the course
(Shrader et al., 2016).
Ventista 169
This means that research, which examines the demographic characteristics of the MOOC
participants, clearly demonstrates that the students who take MOOCs come from a partic-
ular educational and economic background. This might be due to the fact that some
MOOCs are designed only for educated participants. There are examples of research
which examined MOOCs specifically designed to be taken by students who have already
some content background (Phan et al., 2016; Rieber, 2017).
Even though this is a discouraging finding for the accessibility of MOOCs to all learners,
it reveals that there are particular students attending these courses. As a consequence,
specific adjustments in the assessment model could correspond better to the needs of
these students. The type of students who are mostly involved in MOOCs have high levels
of self-regulation and the assessment model should acknowledge this element. Particularly,
research disclosed that learners working as professionals in a field relevant with the MOOC
content and students working towards a higher education degree have higher self-regulation
levels (Hood et al., 2015; Kizilcec et al., 2017). Hence, formal education and prior knowl-
edge are associated with higher self-regulation and performance in the course.
In addition, about 10% of participants in a recent survey (Shrader et al., 2016) reported
refreshing and reviewing existing knowledge as the reason they registered in a MOOC. Thus,
there is a group of MOOC students who take a course to expand upon existing knowledge.
If the students have a basic previous knowledge related to the content of the course or they
are familiar to the task, their self-assessment is more accurate (Boud and Falchikov, 1989;
Fitzgerald et al., 2003). A recent study about online assessment verified that students who
perform poorly overestimated their abilities, whilst the accuracy in self-assessment improved
when the students increased their skills (Dom
inguez et al., 2016).
Concerning the participants of MOOCs, self-assessment can fit the model of their self-
regulatory learning (Zimmerman et al., 1996) and therefore it can be the most appropriate
assessment method for these self-regulated students, particularly when they are interested in
course content and knowledge instead of obtaining a qualification. Nevertheless, the fact
that students do not always perceive their self and their performance in an objective way
cannot be disregarded. Bias may be introduced even in self-assessment based on the way the
students perceive themselves. It is usually questionable to what extent students tend to be
lenient and overrate themselves. Students sometimes regard themselves and their perfor-
mance above average, underestimate the time needed to complete a task and have little
insight of errors of omission (Dunning et al., 2004). Thus, self-image bias is likely to be
present in the self-assessment procedure.
Self-image bias should not be deemed more problematic in a formative self-assessment
than in peer-assessment context. It has been found that a large proportion of the students
undertake an online course to satisfy their curiosity (Hew and Cheung, 2014).These students
want to learn about the course topic, have an intrinsic motivation for the course, and as long
as the assessment remains formative, they do not have a reason to cheat. Furthermore, it has
been found that there are several `auditing' students who watch the lectures that they do not
complete the assessments (Kizilcec et al., 2013). This entails that these students are interested
in the content of the course, but not interested in gaining a certificate or the assessment of a
MOOC. Self-assessment will benefit their own learning and as they have intrinsic motivation
to complete the assessment and evaluate their learning. They are also expected to be con-
cerned about the real outcomes of their learning and try to assess accurately.
The fact that the students are intrinsically motivated does not exclude the possibility of
them being incapable of recognising their own omissions. Nevertheless, peers should not be
170 E-Learning and Digital Media 15(4)
judged more capable assessors, because peer assessors can also fail to identify the mistakes
in the assignments. For instance, Suen (2014) highlighted the likelihood of having peers
grading in favour of some assignments based on their own misconceptions.
It is also possible that those students who are willing to keep a false self-image about their
performance can still disregard the feedback of their peers. Several students who attend
MOOCs support that their peers did not understand their work (Kulkarni et al., 2013),
challenge the ability and the accuracy of their peers to assess their work (Floratos et al.,
2015) and express the opinion that their peers are not qualified to provide feedback (Meek
et al., 2016). Consequently, students can merely retain their self-image and be biased against
the peer assessors. As an answer to this issue, it can be argued that it is more plausible for the
course instructors to develop the self-regulation of students and try to limit the students' self-
image bias rather than persuading them that their peers are competent evaluators. Students
with weaker metacognitive skills and self-regulation can be supported with scaffolding
(Kizilcec et al., 2017).
Limitations
The arguments of this conceptual paper are based on available empirical research evidence.
Therefore, in this section the limitations of the available published research evidence, on
which the arguments of this paper are based, will be reported. The two main limitations of
the research on MOOCs are the small response rate and the lack of representative sample for
all the types of MOOC learners. This means that the research of MOOCs usually has small
response rate compared to the overall number of students registered in the MOOCs (Lee and
Rofe, 2016) and the research sample includes mainly educated participants (Loizzo and
Ertmer, 2016; Salmon et al., 2017).
Pursel et al. (2016) recognised that their survey sample significantly differs from the
general population of students registered to MOOCs and could be involved in the study.
MOOC research projects, which are mostly surveys, manage to recruit as research partic-
ipants these students who are already more engaged and involved in the course. For
instance, Barba et al. (2016) examined the students' motivation in participating in an
eight-week MOOC. Their sample consisted of students who remained engaged in the
course for the last three weeks. Considering the high attrition rates in the MOOCs, it is
apparent that the majority of the students had already dropped out by that point. It is
apparent that the motivation of the students who were still engaged during the last three
weeks of a course cannot represent or explain the motivation of all the students initially
registered in the course.
To summarise, since the response rate is low and the cases participating in MOOC survey
cannot be representative for the whole population of the MOOC learners, the research
findings cannot be generalised. Thus, the external validity of the currently available research
studies is not well established. As a result, the argumentation of this conceptual paper which
is based on the current research on MOOCs might have a partial insight into the topic.
Future research
This paper argued in favour of the self-assessment as the most effective and appropriate
method of formative assessment when open-ended questions and essays in MOOCs are
concerned. This conceptual paper can be followed up by the collection and analysis of
Ventista 171
empirical evidence. As it has been discussed, research has already been conducted to exam-
ine the perceptions of the learners about peer-assessment. Similarly, in future research,
interviews can be conducted to investigate whether the learners in MOOCs perceive that
self-assessment support their learning more than peer-assessment and whether they feel they
can track their learning via their participation in self-assessment. Moreover, an evaluation
of MOOCs which have adopted different approaches to open-ended assessments could
provide with empirical evidence about potential causal relationships between the assessment
methods used and learning occurred. Finally, since this paper argued that self-assessment
can reduce the attrition in MOOCs, a study similar to the research conducted by Jordan
(2015) could take place. Specifically, a study can be conducted in order to identify whether
courses which use only self-assessment have higher completion rates compared to MOOCs
which use auto-grading, peer-assessment or a combination of peer- and self-assessment.
Conclusions
This paper discussed the existing assessment system implemented for open-ended questions
in MOOCs. The emphasis was put on formative assessment, because the majority of the
MOOC students report to be more focused on learning and the course content instead of
getting an accreditation when they are registered in a MOOC. Moreover, MOOC learners
are usually educated, employed people from developed countries taking the courses with
intrinsic motivation and tending to drop out when they lack the time to complete them. The
reasons why peer-assessment is an inappropriate assessment method for these learners were
explained. Instead, self-assessment was argued to be the most suitable assessment method to
correspond to the needs of these self-regulated learners and a potential solution to the high
attrition rates and the patriotic grading bias during peer-assessment.
