Abstract: Perceptions of social closeness and familiarity were assessed among 44
monozygotic (MZA) and 33 dizygotic (DZA) reunited twin pairs, and several
individual twins and triplets. Significantly greater MZA than DZA closeness and
familiarity were found. Closeness and familiarity ratings for co-twins exceeded
those for nonbiological siblings with whom twins were raised. Correlations
between perceptions of physical resemblance and social closeness and familiarity
were positive and statistically significant. However, most correlations between
social relatedness and contact time were non-significant. Associations between
social relatedness and similarities in selected behavioral traits were also
examined. The findings support various theoretical perspectives anticipating
greater affiliation among close relatives than distant relatives.

Introduction
"The brothers shook hands stiffly, when they saw each other for the first
time. They then hugged and burst into laughter. `I looked into his eyes and
saw a reflection of myself . . . I wanted to scream or cry, but all I could do
was laugh.' " (Jim Springer, New York Times Magazine, December 9,
1979)
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
The psychological literature includes numerous reports demonstrating greater
cooperation and affiliation between monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ)
twins (Segal, 2000). These studies represent diverse viewpoints, methods and
populations so convergence among the findings is compelling. Extant research
can be organized into four theoretical perspectives: psychoanalytic/
psychodynamic, behavioral-genetic, social-genetic and evolutionary
psychological. These separate perspectives generate similar and/or related
hypotheses.
Psychoanalytic and Psychodynamic Theories
Psychoanalytic and psychodynamic approaches highlight the unique effects of
shared development with a physically identical sibling. Perceptions of
resemblance by twins and similar treatment by others are held responsible for
blurring co-twins' individuality and sense of self (Siemon and Adelman 1986).
Psychoanalysts have also recognized a "twinning reaction" consisting of "mutual
identification and part fusion of object and self-representation, leading to a
diffusion of ego boundaries between the two individuals" (Joseph 1961:159-161).
This perspective would predict a positive association between physical
resemblance and social closeness.
These themes are well illustrated in Engel's (1975) moving account of the loss
of his MZ twin brother. In a moving address marking the tenth anniversary of his
MZ co-twin's death, psychiatrist George Engel (1975) recalled childhood
nicknames (both were "oth" ­- short for other) and confusion between events
affecting himself and his twin.
Efforts in this area have been almost exclusively case reports and
commentaries. A recurrent difficulty with these approaches is nearly exclusive
focus on look-alike (presumably MZ) pairs, with lack of reference to the crucial
distinction between twin types. The presumption that look-alike twins are
necessarily MZ is also misconceived, given the physical variability among DZ
twinships (Segal, 2000).
Behavioral-Genetic Theory
Behavioral-genetic research assesses relative genetic and environmental
contributions to trait variation. Co-twin similarities in behavior would be expected
to contribute to twin pair assessment and satisfaction with the twin relationship.
MZ twins have shown greater agreement in twinship satisfaction than DZ twins,
although mean ratings in some experiential features (e.g., fighting frequency)
have not always differed (Loehlin and Nichols 1976). Subsequent findings
support both greater "positivity" and reduced "negativity" between MZ twins,
relative to other siblings (Reiss, Neiderhiser, Hetherington and Plomin, 2000). A

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
more recent study found similar levels of intimacy between MZ and DZ twins, but
greater likelihood of MZ twins naming each other as best friends (Foy, Vernon
and Jang 2001).
Behavioral genetics emphasizes reactive gene-environment correlation, the
concept that individuals respond to, rather than create, co-twins' separate and joint
behaviors. Behavioral genetics does not, however, sample the full range of
explanatory domains, leaving some questions (e.g., how social circumstances
modify genetic effects on social relationships) unanswered.
Social-Genetic Theory
Social genetics, a subdiscipline of behavioral genetics, addresses the proximal
effects of genes on social behavior and organization (Hahn 1990, Scott 1997). It
acknowledges that genotypic effects differentially influence individual and joint
behaviors, underlining the contribution of interactants' genetic backgrounds to
social acts and consequences (Hahn 1990). Genetically homogeneous partners
(MZ twins) would be expected to show greater cooperation in problem-solving
tasks, relative to genetically heterogeneous partners (DZ twins).
Exemplary of this approach is Von Bracken's (1934) early experiment,
comparing the behaviors of MZ and DZ twin children working apart and in close
proximity. MZ twins performed more alike when working together than apart.
Among pairs showing the greatest differences when apart, the more skillful twin
allowed the co-twin to catch up when together. In contrast, DZ twins were more
individually motivated. Partners perceiving ability differences were unmotivated
in the presence of their co-twin, given that a cutting edge for competition was
lacking. However, partners perceiving matched abilities competed intensely.
More recently, Segal (1997; 2002) observed greater MZ than DZ twin success and
cooperation during joint puzzle completion even though all twins were
individually competent. Finally, a new study of older twins demonstrated higher
levels of intimacy, attachment security and support within MZ than DZ twin pairs
(Neyer, 2002). In that study, MZ twins' attachment security and relationship
satisfaction were unrelated to contact frequency, while the reverse was true for
DZ twins.
Social genetics builds natural bridges between behavioral genetics and
evolutionary psychology. So far, few studies have proceeded with this view in
mind.
Evolutionary Psychology
Evolutionary psychology aims to identify psychological and physical attributes
promoting survival and reproduction during the course of human history. In
seminal papers, Hamilton (1964a,b) described a theoretical basis for the evolution
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 72
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
of altruism: Natural selection favors alleles predisposing individuals to behave in
ways promoting the transmission of those alleles into later generations. Alleles
influencing individuals to favor others likely to carry replicas of those alleles is an
indirect means by which genes achieve future representation (i.e., inclusive
fitness). The frequency with which one is predisposed to direct benefits to others
should, thus, vary as a function of relative genetic relatedness. MZ twins would,
thus, be expected to show greater within-pair altruism than DZ twins.
Working from this perspective, Segal and Hershberger (1999) observed more
frequent cooperative trials between MZ than DZ twin adolescents and adults
during a Prisoner's Dilemma game. Loh and Elliott (1998) reported greater MZ
than DZ twin cooperation on a task with uncertain reward equality. Interestingly,
the reverse proved true when reward equality was certain, suggesting that
inconsistent dominance relations between some MZ co-twins allows competition
in settings promising matched outcomes to partners.
Evolutionary psychology offers a theoretical framework capable of unifying
multidisciplinary findings (Mealey 2001; McAndrew 2002). Integrating twin and
other behavioral-genetic methods into this approach can facilitate tests of novel
hypotheses and ameliorate concerns over inattention to behavioral variation
within species.
Twins Raised Apart
Twin studies of social relatedness have been limited to twins raised together.
Despite numerous publications on reared apart twins, spanning 75 years (Popenoe
1922; Mueller 1925; Newman, Freeman and Holzinger 1937; Shields 1962; Juel-
Nielsen 1966; Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal and Tellegen 1990; Bouchard,
McGue, Hur, and Horn 1998; Kendler, Thornton, and Pedersen 2000; Kervinen,
Kaprio, Koskenvuo, Juntunen, and Kesanieme 1998), twin relationships in
reunited pairs have never been assessed systematically. These rare pairs offer a
unique model for exploring genetic and environmental underpinnings of social
relatedness, at both proximate and ultimate explanatory levels.
Early reared apart twin studies and reports (Popenoe 1922: 1 MZA pair;
Newman, Freeman and Holzinger 1937: 19 MZA pairs; Shields 1962: 44 MZA
pairs Juel-Nielsen; 1966: 12 MZA pairs) appended biographical details to the
quantitative findings. This material is illuminating, but limited. First, DZA twin
pairs were not recruited, thus precluding comparative evaluation by zygosity.
Second, the quality of available information varies across cases and studies.
Despite these caveats, this work has yielded some theoretically provocative
trends. It appears that 40 of the 76 pairs showed close social relations as
evidenced by frequent contact following reunion, satisfaction with the
relationship, investigator's comments and other indicators. In contrast, 14 pairs
did not display warm relations. The remaining 22 pairs were difficult to judge
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 73
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
because of "mixed" characterizations and/or because contact was controlled by
young twins' adoptive families. In summary, nearly three-fourths of the pairs for
whom information was unequivocal (40/54) developed close social relationships
soon after meeting.
The rapport displayed by these previously studied MZA twins challenges the
view that shared time is requisite to developing close social attachments and
similar interests. Perspectives acknowledging the contribution of twins' relative
genetic relatedness to their social relations would seem necessary. Mechanisms
underlying social closeness and affiliation are examined below.
Social Relatedness Mechanisms
Similarity as a basis for attraction and liking is supported by numerous
psychological observations. Similarities include physical, behavioral and
situational features. Keller, Thiessen and Young (1996) showed that both dating
and married couples assort positively for physical traits (e.g., age and bodily
attractiveness) and behavioral traits (e.g., humor and imaginativeness). Married
couples, however, showed greater assortment for behavioral traits, suggesting that
psychological similarity contributes more importantly to relationship duration.
The assortative mating literature does, in fact, include many studies showing
various degrees of positive spousal assortment across measured traits (Plomin,
DeFries, McClearn, and McGuffin 2001). Consistent with these findings are
studies linking personality and attitudinal similarities (and perceptions of these
similarities) with friendship attraction across age groups (Rosenblatt and
Greenberg 1988; Eiser, Morgan, Gammage, Broos, and Kirby 1991; Rubin,
Lynch, Coplan, Rose-Krasnor and Booth 1994). Rowe, Woulbroun and Gulley
(1994) emphasized that friends' behavioral similarities are present prior to
relationship formation.
In their classic work, Tiger and Fox (1971) asserted that members of groups
are held together by symbolic processes; thus, one responds to person categories
by virtue of common unifying features. Examples include the communality and
support of kibbutz children (Bettelheim 1969) and bereaved relatives (Lieberman
1993).
Cultural conceptions of twins affect beliefs about their roles and relationships
(Gufler, 1996; Renne and Bastian 2001). Western cultures typically associate
twinship with expectations of behavioral and physical similarities, not differences
(Stewart 2000). Stereotypes of twins convey the idea of extraordinary emotional
closeness and intimacy between co-twins, especially those who are same-sex.
These beliefs are a likely reflection of the phenotypic similarities shown by most
genetically identical twins. Many people are, however, insensitive to the varieties
of twinning, so apply this view equally to MZ and DZ pairs. In fact, it has been
argued that "the social label `twin,' for both types of twins, is more valid or
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 74
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
consequential than the label monozygotic twin or dizygotic twin" (Stewart
2000:729). Of course, not all twins and their families conform to these views
either in belief or behavior.
Some evolutionary researchers have considered mechanisms shaping the
infrastructure of our social relations. At the proximal level, attraction may be
facilitated by phenotypic matching, a mechanism proposed to foster recognition of
close kin. Specifically, information is learned about one's own phenotypic
characteristics and those of relatives. The outcome of this learning process is an
"image," "template" (Sherman and Holmes 1985) or "learned standard of
appearance" (Trivers 1985) against which to assess the phenotype of an
unfamiliar individual. (Accurate identification of individuals would be requisite to
directing altruism toward genetically related recipients, as prescribed by
Hamilton. It also lends meaning to the social-psychological view that "similarities
attract.") The nature of proximal mechanisms facilitating attraction between
family members does, however, warrant elaboration. A recent study demonstrated
that emotional closeness partially mediates the effect of genetic relatedness on
willingness to behave altruistically (Korchmoros and Kenny 2001).
It is possible that MZ and DZ twins' behavioral and/or physical similarities
(and dissimilarities) and their perceptions of these features underlie emotional and
cognitive processes affecting social bonding between them. This view concurs
with the proposal (based on MZ twins' close attachment) that "Recognition of this
sense [of 'we'] triggers a series of emotions whose net effect is tribal unity and the
increased chance for altruism" (Freedman, 1979:129). Such reasoning lends fresh
dimensions to psychodynamic explanations which see causal connections between
twins' physical identity, treatment by others and close attachment.
The Present Study
The present study compared subjective social closeness in MZA and DZA twin
pairs. It also compared twins' feelings of familiarity, defined as "how well you
think you know this person." The social relationship literature draws a distinction
between subjective closeness (perceptions of relationship quality) and behavioral
closeness (degree and variety of interaction) (Aron, Aron and Smollan 1992). The
former conceptualization was the focus of the present work.
Hypotheses were generated by evolutionary theorizing, although expected
findings would support the range of theoretical perspectives presented above. The
first hypothesis was that MZA twins would experience greater social closeness
and familiarity than DZA twins. Second, it was expected that degree of contact
prior to assessment would not be associated with social relatedness. Third, it was
anticipated that twins' perceptions of their physical similarity would correlate
positively with the nature of their social relations. Fourth, it was expected that
reunited twins would feel socially closer and more familiar to one another than to

the unrelated siblings with whom they were raised. Associations between social
relations and personality traits, interests, values and education were also of
interest.
Method
Sample and Procedures
Twins were participants in the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart
(MISTRA). The MISTRA is a longitudinal study of twins separated at birth,
reared in separate homes and reunited as adults. This project was launched in
1979 in the Psychology Department at the University of Minnesota (Bouchard, et
al. 1990). The majority of twins came from the United States and Great Britain,
while some came from Australia, Canada, China, New Zealand, Sweden, the
Netherlands and Germany. Twins were identified by referrals from colleagues, the
media, reunion registries and other sources. Participants were invited to the
University of Minnesota where they completed approximately fifty hours of
psychological and medical testing. A detailed description of the assessment
schedule is available in Segal (2000).
The final sample consisted of 44 MZA twin pairs, 33 DZA twin pairs and 7
individual twins and triplets. Two sets of triplets were entered as three pairs each.
Twins ranged in age from 16 ­ 70 years, with a mean age of 45.28 years (sd =
13.68). Age at separation ranged from 0 to 54.08 months with a mean age of 8.03
months (sd = 12.64). DZA twins were separated significantly later than MZA
twins [t (54.71) = -2.14, p< .05]. Time from separation to first contact ranged
from 2 years to 69 years with a mean time of 37.09 years (sd = 14.51). DZA twins
exceeded MZA twins on this measure, a difference that approached statistical
significance [t (75) = -1.76, p< .08]. It is likely that DZA twins' differing
appearance extended their time until reunion because they were unlikely to be
mistaken for one another. (The natural DZ twinning rate is approximately twice as
high as the MZ twinning rate in western societies; see Bulmer [1970]. However,
most DZA twins' meetings were facilitated by personal searches and/or
professional assistance. In contrast, a number of MZA twin pairs were reunited
because they were mistaken for one another by others.) Additional descriptive
characteristics of the twins are summarized in Tables 1a and 1b.
This study presents mostly pair analyses, although some individual analyses
are included. (Some inflation of p-values in individual analyses may occur due to
lack of independence from paired observations.) Sample sizes vary across
analyses depending upon availability of data. Adjustment was also made in
individual analyses for triplets included in multiple pairings.

Measures
Zygosity was assessed by serological analyses using blood samples gathered
while the twins were in Minnesota. Based on these results, plus comparison of
anthropometric measures (fingerprint ridgecount, ponderal index and cephalic
index), the probability of misclassifying a DZ pair as MZ is less than .001
(Lykken 1978). Serological findings were unavailable for several weeks so, with
the exception of opposite-sex twins (whose sex difference classified them as DZ),
participants did not know their twin type with certainty during the study.
A Twin Relationship Survey (TRS) was introduced into the standard
assessment schedule in 1983. TRSs were completed independently by each twin
with the assistance of a trained examiner. Several twins completed the survey by
mail, a procedure that was possible given that each section contained clear
instructions. Questions concerned the circumstances of separation, the nature of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 77
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
the adoption experience, events surrounding the search for the twin, impressions
of physical resemblance, perceptions of social relatedness and reactions to other
twinship features. In some cases only one pair member took part in this phase of
the study due to scheduling considerations. Given that the TRS was unavailable in
the study's early years (1979-1982) approximately 25% of the twins completed it
during their ten-year follow-up visit.
The present study examines twins' perceptions of initial (retrospective) and
current social closeness and familiarity vis-à-vis contact time, perceived physical
resemblance and similarity in measured behavioral traits.
Social Relatedness
Twins recalled their initial impression of social closeness using a six-point
scale (1 = closer than best friends to 6 = less close than most people I meet for the
first time). Comparable ratings were requested for current closeness, and for
initial and current familiarity. (Initial ratings were retrospective and referred to
the first meeting in adulthood. Current ratings reflected twins' present feelings at
the time of participation in the study.) Twins also provided current social
closeness and familiarity ratings for the unrelated siblings with whom they were
raised, furnishing an informative comparison group. If ratings were available for
more than one adoptive brother (and/or sister) the brother (and/or sister) whose
score(s) reflected the highest levels of closeness and familiarity were chosen. This
was done to set up a more stringent test of differences between ratings for co-
twins and unrelated siblings.
The two current measures showed significant relationships with frequency of
thinking about the twin (current closeness, .52, p< .01; current familiarity, .38, p<
.01, n = 155-156) and having plans to meet in the future (current closeness, .45,
p< .01; current familiarity, .38, p< .01, n = 151-152). These items, therefore,
appear to be tapping the positive nature of the relationship.
Contact Time
Twins' contact time measures included days before separation, separation to
first contact (years), reunion to assessment (months), total contact time (weeks),
total time apart (cumulative time together, in months, from birth to assessment)
and percent of lifetime apart (total time apart/age in months). These data were
obtained separately from both twins during the life history interview on the first
assessment day. This information was important to obtain given some critics'
claims that reared apart twins' similarities are explained by length of contact,
status of rearing family (biological or adoptive) and other life events. (See
Bouchard, 1993 for a discussion and refutation of these allegations.)

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
Physical Resemblance
Twins judged their physical resemblance using a six-point scale (1 = as alike
as two copies of the same person to 6 = not at all similar; no more alike than any
two people of the same age and sex). This question referred to the current time
frame. This item was highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .92) with reference to a
second physical similarity measure (perceived physical resemblance if weight
and/or hair style were the same), rated on the same six-point scale. Its validity is
demonstrated by its significant correlation with zygosity (r = .67, p< .01, n = 157).
Personality
The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) was routinely
administered to all participants. MPQ scales represent eleven personality
dimensions (e.g., well-bring, stress reaction) and three higher order factors
(positive emotionality, negative emotionality and constraint) (Tellegen 1982,
1985). One month test-retest reliabilities range from .82 - .92, and internal
consistency reliabilities (Cronbach's alpha) range from .76- .89. Validity scales
identify questionable records (Tellegen, Lykken, Bouchard, Wilcox, Segal and
Rich 1988). Heritabilities of .30 to .50 for MPQ Big Five markers have been
reported (Bouchard 1997a).
Interests
The Strong Vocational Interest Blank-Campbell Interest Inventory (SVIB-
SCII; Hansen and Campbell 1985) was administered to all participants. It is
organized into sections assessing preferences (like ­ indifferent - dislike) for
occupations, school subjects and activities, as well as preferences for one of two
activities. A final section assesses personality characteristics. Responses yield
scores for scales representing General Occupational Themes (6 scales), Basic
Interests (23 scales) and Occupations (207 scales). Two week test-retest
reliabilities exceed .90. The predictive and concurrent validities of the scales have
been well documented and are available in the 1985 manual (Hansen and
Campbell 1985). Twins reared apart data have yielded mean heritabilities of .35
and .37 for the General Occupational Themes (e.g., Artistic, Social) and Basic
Interest scales (e.g., Nature, Mechanical), respectively (Moloney, Bouchard and
Segal 1991). (Only occupational themes and interests were investigated in the
present study.) Somewhat higher heritabilities were found in a subsequent study
combining twins reared apart and together, using alternative measures (Lykken,
Bouchard, McGue and Tellegen (1993).

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
Values
The Allport-Vernon-Lindzey (AVL) Study of Values (Allport, Vernon and
Linzey 1960) measures six values (Religious, Social, Economic, Political,
Aesthetic and Theoretical). Scoring is ipsative such that scores on one dimension
are influenced by scores on another dimension. Split-half reliabilities range from
.84 - .85, and one month test-retest reliabilities range from .77 - .92. The validity
of the AVL is demonstrated by numerous studies which have examined scores of
groups with known characteristics (Allport, Vernon and Lindzey 1970).
Educational Background
Life history information generated scores for years of higher education and the
Hollingshead Educational code. The Hollingshead Educational code indicates
level of education completed, ranging from 1 (less than seventh grade) to 7
(graduate degree) (Hollingshead 1975). Individuals still in school were excluded
from these analyses.
Results
Associations Between Social Relatedness Measures and Other Variables
1. Social Closeness and Familiarity
The four social relatedness measures (initial and current closeness; initial and
current familiarity) correlated negligibly with age (r = -.00 to .01, n = 156 - 161)
and sex (r = -.15 to .00, n = 156 - 161). In addition, all four measures showed
negligible or slight correlations with the six contact time measures (-.16 to .21, n
= 133 - 161). Two correlations deserve comment. First, the relationship between
days before separation and current familiarity, while significant (r = .16, p< .05, n
= 161), was in a counterintuitive direction. (This correlation suggested that longer
time together predicted reduced familiarity.) However, elimination of several
outlying cases yielded a smaller, non-significant correlation (r = .10, ns, n = 154).
Second, the correlation between time from reunion to assessment and current
closeness (r = .21, p< .05, n = 150) suggested that twins studied soon after
meeting were socially closer than those studied later. However, many factors
affected scheduling (e.g., twins' work responsibilities; twins' distance from
Minneapolis), thus tempering this finding.
Mean ratings of initial closeness, current closeness and initial familiarity did
not differ between DZA same-sex and opposite-sex twins. The difference in
current familiarity approached, but did not achieve, statistical significance. These
two twin groups were, therefore, combined in subsequent analyses.

2. Social Relatedness and Physical Resemblance
Twins' current perception of physical similarity correlated significantly with
current closeness (r = .28, p< .01, n = 157) and with current familiarity (r = .33,
p< .01, n = 157) for the combined sample. Age and sex were unrelated to
perceptions of physical resemblance.
Recall that physical similarity correlated significantly with zygosity (r = . 67,
p< .01, n = 157), such that MZA twins judged themselves to look more alike than
did DZA twins. This was expected, given the causal relationship between genetic
factors and physical development. Assigning this variable as a covariate in
subsequent analyses would have violated the assumption of independence
between the covariate and independent measure and removed meaningful
variance. It was, nevertheless, interesting to examine physical similarity-social
relatedness correlations within zygosity groups. (Separate correlations did not
differ for DZA same-sex and opposite-sex twins. DZA opposite-sex twins' mean
physical similarity rating was somewhat below that of the DZA same-sex twins,
as expected.) Correlations between physical similarity and current closeness were
statistically significant for both MZA (r = .33, p< .01, n = 89) and DZA twins (r =
.29, p< .05, n = 68), and did not differ between twin groups. The correlation
between physical similarity and current familiarity was statistically significant for
MZA twins (r = .46, p< .01, n = 89), but not for DZA twins (r = .16, ns, n = 68), a
difference that was statistically significant (z = 2.044, p< .05).
MZA vs. DZA Twin Pairs
Twin Group Differences in Mean Ratings
A repeated measures analysis of variance compared MZA-DZA twin
differences in initial and current closeness and familiarity. The design included
one between-subjects measure (Zygosity: MZA, DZA) and two within-subjects
measures (Feeling: closeness, familiarity and Time: initial, current). The
assumption of homogeneity of variance-covariance matrices was satisfied. Given
that twin data are not independent, the analysis used mean social relatedness
ratings for each pair (see Kenny and Judd, 1986); data from individual twins
(twins whose co-twins did not complete the TRS) were retained. The between-
subjects effect of zygosity was statistically significant [F (1, 80) = 6.26, p< .01,
2 = .07] and, as expected, MZA twins expressed greater overall closeness and
familiarity than DZA twins. Significant within-subject effects were observed for
both Feeling [F (1, 80) = 7.55, p<.01, 2 = .09] and Time [F(1, 80) = 5.32 p< .05,
2= .06]. Specifically, twins experienced greater closeness than familiarity toward
their co-twin, and current ratings generally exceeded initial ratings. A significant

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
feeling by time effect [F(1, 80) = 26.34 p< .001, 2 = .25] indicated increased
familiarity across time, but little change in closeness. None of the interactions
involving zygosity were significant. Mean ratings for MZA and DZA twins are
displayed in Table 2.

Twin Group Differences in Distributional Characteristics
It was anticipated that the most meaningful differentiation between MZA and
DZA twins would occur at the highest levels of social relatedness ("closer than
best friends;" "more familiar than best friends"). Of course, DZA twins are
genetically equivalent to full siblings so some would be expected to feel quite
close and familiar after meeting. However, if reared apart twins' social
relationships mirror those of reared together twins, then higher proportions of
MZA than DZA twins should endorse the highest choice levels. Few pairs of
either zygosity were expected to endorse the lowest levels of social relatedness
(e.g., "less close than most people I meet for the first time"; "less familiar than
most people I meet for the first time"). Frequency tables revealed reduced
numbers of subjects in the lowest choice categories, so the data were recast into
four 2 x 3 contingency tables: zygosity by three response categories (choice 1:
closer/more familiar than best friends; choice 2: as close/as familiar as best
friends; choices 3 ­ 6: less close/less familiar than best friends). These data are
displayed graphically in Figures 1a ­ 1d.

Fig. 1a-1d.
There are several interesting features to these findings. First, as expected, all
chi square analyses showed that the largest MZA-DZA differences occurred in the
proportion of twins endorsing the highest levels of closeness and familiarity. Only
two (initial closeness: [2(2) = 5.34, p< .07] and initial familiarity [2(2) = 11.76,
p< .01]) approached/achieved statistical significance, respectively; this probably
reflected the reduced cell sizes from using pair data. Significance tests for
residuals in the case of initial familiarity (choice 1) were statistically significant
[MZA: z = 1.668, p< .05, 1-tailed; DZA: z = 1.884, p< .05, 1-tailed]. Second, the
proportion of DZA twins' endorsing the highest level of current closeness was
somewhat less than the proportion of MZA twins' endorsing the highest level of
initial closeness (although the zygosity x feeling x time interaction in the repeated
measures analysis was not statistically significant).
Twin-Sibling Differences in Mean Ratings
Comparative examination of twins' closeness and familiarity ratings for their
co-twins and for the adoptive siblings with whom they were raised offered

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
another approach to issues posed in this study. The mean age difference between
twins and their adoptive brothers was 6.41 years (sd = 5.04) and ranged from 1 to
22 years. The mean age difference between twins and their adoptive sisters was
6.64 years (sd=5.28) and ranged from 1 to 20 years. Age differences were
uncorrelated with closeness and similarity ratings for twins' adoptive siblings.
Current social relatedness ratings were used to achieve twin-sibling
comparability. Mean sibling scores were used if twins provided ratings for both
an adoptive brother and an adoptive sister. In addition, in order to circumvent bias
introduced from linked observations, twin pair means were used when data were
provided by both pair members; this reduced the sample size from 61 to 41. Only
participants with complete data records were included.
The analysis was a repeated measures design with two within-subject factors:
Relative (twin and sibling) and Feeling (closeness and familiarity). All tests of
within-subject effects were statistically significant or approached significance:
[Relative: F(1,40) = 26.79, p< .001, 2 = .40 ; Feeling: F(1,40) = 3.19, p< .08, 2
= .07; and Relative by Feeling: F (1,40) = 3.78, p< .06, 2 = .09]. Feelings were
stronger for co-twins than for adoptive siblings, and feelings of familiarity
exceeded feelings of closeness. Twins rated co-twin closeness and co-twin
familiarity equally, but they rated adoptive sibling familiarity higher than
adoptive sibling closeness. Mean ratings are presented in Table 3.

siblings were revealing. These differences were first evaluated by the Stuart-
Maxwell chi square statistic which is appropriate when marginal frequencies are
not independent (Fleiss 1981; also see Stuart, 1955). This analysis showed a
significant difference in the distribution of co-twin­adoptive sibling ratings for
both closeness [2(2) = 26.29, p< .001] and familiarity [2(2) = 16.70, p<.001].
This analysis does not, however, consider the ordering inherent in these ratings.
The data were, therefore, further examined by the method of Fleiss and Everitt
(1971, cited in Fleiss 1981) to determine if the two sets of responses were
distributed differently at the ends of the scale. Significant chi square values
showed greater concentrations of "high level" co-twin ratings and "low level"
adoptive sibling ratings for both closeness [2(1) = 21.06, p< .001] and familiarity
[2(1) = 21.06, p< .001]. (The chi square values were identical!). These data are
displayed in Figures 2a and 2b.

Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
Personality, Interests, Values and Education
Prior to analysis, scale scores for personality traits, interests and values were
age- and sex-corrected according to the methods of McGue and Bouchard (1984).
Age corresponded to the time at which these psychological traits were assessed;
thus, questionnaires for some twins were administered up to ten years earlier than
the TRS. (In other words, those twins completing the TRS during the follow-up
visit had completed personality and interest forms during the initial visit.) The
age-sex adjustment procedure utilized information from 443 individuals including
reared apart twins and their significant others (e.g., spouses, partners, adoptive
siblings and children) who accompanied them to Minnesota. Mean score
substitution was used to accommodate missing data.
Data are reported for 41 ­ 43 MZA twin pairs and for 31 ­ 33 DZA twin pairs.
The absolute co-twin difference in each scale was correlated with both the (1)
absolute co-twin difference and (2) twin pair mean on each social relatedness
measure. These correlations provide different information. For example, the first
correlation shows whether a small difference in a personality trait (e.g., social
potency) is associated with a small difference in social relatedness (e.g., current
closeness). However, co-twins with a small personality difference might show a
small closeness difference at either end of that scale. The second correlation
supplements the first by revealing whether a small difference in personality is
associated with greater mean pair closeness. In the context of the present study,
pairs of correlations were considered meaningful if both types were statistically
significant. Given the large number of correlations calculated, the significance
level was set to .001 to contain type I error.
Personality
Mean correlations between the social relatedness measures and eleven
personality traits were quite modest, ranging from -.01 to .23 for MZA twins and
from -.03 to .19 for DZA twins. The only statistically significant findings were the
DZA twin correlations between co-twin difference in aggression and twin pair
mean in initial closeness (r = .57), and co-twin difference in absorption and co-
twin difference in current familiarity (r = .71). Thus, small co-twin differences in
aggression were associated with early impressions of increased social closeness,
and co-twin differences in absorption were associated with co-twin differences in
current familiarity. However, the corresponding correlations were not statistically
significant.
Occupations and Interests
Mean correlations across the six occupational themes were small, ranging from
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 86
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
-.03 to .22 for MZA twins and from .09 to .22 for DZA twins. For MZA twins, the
co-twin difference in Artistic occupations correlated significantly with mean pair
current familiarity (r = .52), but the corresponding correlation was non-
significant. None of the DZA twin correlations were statistically significant.
Mean correlations across the twenty-three basic interests ranged from -.00 to
.18 for MZA twins and from .12 to .18 for DZA twins. For MZA twins, the co-
twin difference in science interest correlated significantly with mean pair initial
familiarity (r = .58). For DZA twins, correlations were statistically significant
between the co-twin difference in Domestic Arts and co-twin difference in current
closeness (r = .53), and between the co-twin difference in Nature and the co-twin
difference in initial closeness (r = .64). However, corresponding correlations were
not significant.
Values
Mean correlations across the six values ranged from -.04 to .15 for MZA twins
and -.02 to .12 for DZA twins. None of the correlations reached statistical
significance.
Educational Background
For MZA twins, both correlations involving the Hollingshead Educational
Code and initial familiarity were statistically significant. A smaller co-twin
difference in education was associated with a smaller co-twin difference in initial
familiarity (r = .49), and with increased mean pair initial familiarity (r = .58).
None of the DZA twin correlations reached statistical significance.
Discussion
This study was the first to systematically explore associations between genetic
and social relatedness in twins reared apart. Adoptive siblings of the reared apart
twins furnished a unique comparison group.
Twin Group and Sibling Differences
As expected, greater closeness and familiarity between MZA co-twins than
DZA co-twins was demonstrated. Also, as expected, MZA and DZA twins'
ratings were most sharply differentiated at the highest levels of social relatedness.
Initial experiences of closeness and familiarity reached/achieved statistical
significance, while current experiences did not. These findings place the well-
known "twin bond phenomenon" in a scientific context. Specifically, the greater
social attraction initially experienced by MZA twins suggests that correlates of
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 87
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
genetic identity confer special understandings between these twins, despite
meeting for the first time as adults. This interpretation receives some support from
the fact that DZA twins' current closeness ratings were somewhat below MZA
twins' initial closeness ratings. A purely cultural explanation (i.e., society expects
twins to be close so they act accordingly) appears unwarranted, given the twin
group differences that emerged.
The finding that closeness ratings exceeded familiarity ratings for twins overall
is not surprising. The twins were living apart all their lives so the newly found co-
twin, while triggering feelings of closeness, may have still seemed somewhat
novel or unfamiliar. Feelings of familiarity did, understandably, increase over
time for both MZA and DZA twins as they grew better acquainted.
Twins' closeness and familiarity ratings for their adoptive siblings furnished an
important backdrop against which to assess their ratings for their co-twins. The
higher ratings for twins than siblings demonstrate that (1) shared time is not
mandatory for developing close social relations and (2) genetic relatedness affects
social relationships. The concentrations of co-twin ratings at the high ends of the
social relatedness scales, and adoptive sibling ratings at the low ends, underline
the differential social significance of these relatives to reared apart twins. Higher
familiarity than closeness ratings for adoptive siblings are not surprising because
the twins and their adoptive siblings were raised together since infancy and
childhood.
Twins' perceptions of their physical resemblance correlated significantly with
their feelings of current closeness and familiarity. This finding does not imply a
causal association, partly because of the confounding of MZA twins' physical and
behavioral similarities. Disentangling these effects would require organizing
MZA twins according to various combinations of physical and personality
similarity. Note that physical resemblance correlated significantly with closeness
for both zygosity groups, but with familiarity for MZA twins only. Perhaps some
MZA twins accentuate slight physical differences, leading to feelings of reduced
familiarity, relative to more "look-alike" twins. Current familiarity between some
DZA co-twins may rely more importantly on degree of resemblance in other
phenotypic traits. Unfortunately, twins' perceptions of their physical similarity to
their co-twin at the time of meeting (and to their adoptive siblings) were
unavailable.
The present findings are, thus, consistent with Hamilton's inclusive fitness
theory which views altruistic acts toward close genetic relatives as a way of
facilitating transmission of genes into future generations. An evolutionary
psychological interpretation does not deny contributions from other theoretical
perspectives. Instead, it both invigorates and gains from these views. For
example, evolutionary psychology refines psychodynamic understanding of how
treatment by others may affect social relations. Other peoples' responses to twins'
behaviors may reflect or reinforce (but not create) their affiliative feelings.
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 88
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
Conversely, psychodynamic theories offer rich descriptive material to which
evolutionary researchers may turn for proximal mechanisms underlying social
relatedness.
Few meaningful associations emerged between twins' social relatedness
measures and similarities in personality, interests, values and education. The only
exception was the pair of significant MZA twin correlations between the
Hollingshead educational code and initial familiarity. Of course, twins do not
respond to their co-twins' educational background per se, but most likely to the
ideas, activities and motivations underlying their educational experiences. A
closer look at factors driving these MZA correlations, and the absence of these
relationships among DZA twins, would be worth pursuing.
Despite the absence of clear findings, it may be premature to conclude that
twins' similarities in personality, interests and values are irrelevant to social
relatedness. It is possible that the MPQ scales are insensitive to facets of
personality and temperament that meaningfully shape relations between reunited
relatives. It is also possible that alternative instruments, as well as twins' own
perceptions of their similarities in general intelligence, special abilities,
personality traits, values and interests would provide a more comprehensive
assortment of measures for assessing the bases of social relatedness. Leek and
Smith (1991) found that relatives' perceived personality similarity correlated with
various help and conflict measures. Twins' evolving relations may have also
rested partly on interpersonal factors not measured in the present study.
Attributes such as "trust," "openness" and "spontaneity" are valued in twin
relationships (Foy, Vernon and Jang 2001) so may modify closeness and
familiarity.
The present study is not without limitations. Twins' closeness and familiarity
were assessed using four single-item measures. Future studies will, hopefully,
corroborate these findings via multi-item scales and diverse methods. However,
one- and two-item measures (e.g., Inclusion of Other in the Self Scale [IOS] and
Social Closeness Scale [SCL]) have proven valid in studies on the nature and
structure of social closeness (see Aron, Aron, and Smollan1992; Aron and Fraley
1999). Both these measures assess relatedness on a 1 to 7 scale, similar to items
used in the present study, although the IOS uses a pictorial format.
More detailed assessment of the nature of twins' contact time prior to
assessment (e.g., type of activities; presence of others) could augment the present
findings. For example, time from reunion to assessment was significantly longer
for MZA than DZA twins, raising the possibility that MZA twins used that
opportunity to interact. However, shorter time from reunion to assessment was
associated with increased current closeness. It is, therefore, plausible that socially
closer twins were more eager participants than those who felt less close. This
relationship remained significant for MZA twins (r = .35, n = 83), but not for
DZA twins (r = -.02, n = 67). However, as indicated above, scheduling was
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 89
Meeting One's Twin: Perceived Social Closeness and Familiarity
affected by many factors so this association should be viewed cautiously. It is also
possible that closeness may be experienced even without frequent and varied
contact. Aron and Fraley (1999) found that degree of self-other overlap was
associated with subjective feelings of closeness, but not with behavioral
interaction.
It might be objected that even though zygosity assignments were unavailable
during participation, twins' impressions of their twin type (based on physical
resemblance and/or other indicators) may have biased their subjective relationship
experience. This possibility cannot be fully discounted, but seems unlikely. First,
cultural conceptions of twinship do not draw sharp distinctions between twin
types (Stewart 2000). Second, twins' treatment by others is generally unrelated to
co-twin similarity in behavior (LaBuda, Svikis, and Pickens1997; Klump, Holly,
Iacono, McGue, and Willson 2000.) Third, parental treatment of twins is
associated with true zygosity, not perceived zygosity (Goodman and Stevenson
1991). Finally, in the present study, correlations between twinship preference
while searching for the twin (1= hoped to look exactly the same to 4 = did not
care how similar or different we looked) and the four social relatedness measures
were negligible (r = -.01 to .19, n = 75).
Conclusions
The present study suggests several points. First, twin research methodology is
useful for assessing evolutionary-based hypotheses concerning genetic and social
relatedness. Second, the greater affiliation between MZA than DZA twins should
redirect attention to proximal social processes underlying these differences. The
additional finding that closeness and familiarity ratings for newly found co-twins
exceeded those for adoptive siblings is compelling and worth additional study.
Future work on the bases of social relations should move in exciting directions
if integrated with molecular genetic analysis. It will be interesting to determine if,
and to what extent, associations between perceptions of physical resemblance and
social relatedness may be mediated by degree of genetic overlap. Some early twin
studies suggest that this is so. Pakstis, Scarr-Salapatek, Elston and Siervogel
(1972) reported correlations between DZ twins' absolute number of blood group
differences and physical dissimilarity and activity level. Dumont-Driscoll and
Rose (1983) found that DZ twins sharing more blood groups showed greater
confusion over their twin type and received higher similarity ratings from mothers
than DZ twins sharing fewer blood groups. Such research, as well as studies
suggesting links between specific genes and personality traits (Benjamin, Lin,
Patterson, et al. 1996), support the feasibility of such efforts.
Identifying the processes underlying MZ-DZ twin relationships may enhance
understanding of many complex human social behaviors. We might, for example,
better comprehend why some family members are more closely affiliated than

others, why people grieve more for some relatives than for others, why it is
important for many adoptees to search for biological kin and why it is necessary
for many children conceived through sperm donation to locate their fathers.
