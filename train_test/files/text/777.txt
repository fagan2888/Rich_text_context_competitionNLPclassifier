Objectives. This study examines the relationship between the lack of private supplemental health insurance cover-
age and the development of disability among adults aged 65 and older.
Methods. Data are from the baseline and six follow-up waves of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly survey (N = 4,000). Discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the impact of insur-
ance coverage and other risk factors on the incidence of disability among those unimpaired at baseline.
Results. Controlling for education, income, and other potential confounders, the odds of developing disability were
35-49% higher among those without private coverage. Insurance coverage also statistically explained part of the in-
creased risk of disability among low-income persons.
Discussion. The results indicate that changes in health insurance coverage as well as in individual behaviors may be
needed to reduce disability generally and disability among the socioeconomically disadvantaged, in particular.
'T'HIS article examines the lack of supplemental health
A insurance as a risk factor for disability among older
Americans covered by Medicare. As insurance coverage is
a risk factor amenable to intervention, research into its im-
pact on illness and disability has important implications for
policies and programs designed to improve the nation's
health. Despite this, health insurance coverage has received
considerably less attention than other risk factors in studies
of disability among elderly persons. In reviewing prior re-
search, we found numerous studies where demographic
characteristics, health behaviors (smoking, drinking, obe-
sity), and/or acute and chronic stress were included as risk
factors for disability. Insurance coverage was a risk factor
in only one study (Wolinsky, Stump, Callahan, & Johnson,
1996), and there it was a proxy for socioeconomic status.
In part, the lack of attention given to insurance coverage
reflects the belief that Medicare has minimized differences
in access to care among adults aged 65 and older (House
et al., 1992, 1994; Mechanic, 1978). Some reviewers (Ad-
ler, Boyce, Chesney, Folkman, & Syme, 1993; Bunker &
Gomby, 1989; Pincus & Callahan, 1994) downplay the im-
portance of insurance coverage generally as a risk factor
for health status. The evidence they cite is mostly indirect
rather than based on studies where insurance coverage is
included as a risk factor for health outcomes. Findings that
the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and
health is linear (with each higher level of SES associated
with improved health) are taken as indicating that inade-
quate access to health care is not an important risk factor. A
nonlinear pattern, with the economically disadvanged who
cannot afford insurance coverage at increased risk, is con-
sidered more consistent with insurance effects. Findings
from the Black report (Department of Health and Social
Security, 1980) showing that socioeconomic inequalities in
health have persisted in Great Britain, even after the Na-
tional Health Service was established in 1948, are also
cited to argue that universal coverage would not have a sig-
nificant impact on these inequalities.
Not all reviewers agree with this assessment of the evi-
dence. Williams and Collins (1995) point out that some
U.S. studies find a nonlinear relationship between SES and
health, with health gains diminishing as income increases,
and that medical care may have a greater impact on health
among disadvantaged groups who are already at increased
risk (Williams, 1990). They conclude that although more
than increased access is needed to improve the health of the
economically disadvantaged, access remains a crucial fac-
tor. There is also considerable evidence that Medicare has
not equalized access to health care among older persons.
Among Medicare recipients, low-income enrollees receive
less care (Friedman, 1991), are in poorer health when they
receive care (Feinstein, 1993), and receive poorer quality
care (Gornick et al., 1996).
There is reason to believe that differences in insurance
coverage may account, at least in part, for the continued
impact of income on health among older persons. Out-of-
pocket expenses associated with the use of Medicare-reim-
bursed services can be substantial (Blustein, 1995; Morrow,
S258
INSURANCE COVERAGE AND DISABILITY S259
1996). For the very poor, these expenses are covered by
Medicaid. Some others have supplemental employer-spon-
sored or individually purchased ("Medigap") policies. Typi-
cally, these policies cover copayments, deductibles, and
other expenses associated with the use of Medicare-reim-
bursed services, as well as some services (e.g., prescription
drugs and some types of home care) not covered by Medi-
care. Compared to those with supplemental insurance,
Medicare enrollees without private insurance are less likely
to receive preventive care (Blustein, 1995). They are also
less likely to have at least one physician visit per year
(Mentnech, Ross, Park, & Brenner, 1995) and are more
likely to wait longer when they do visit a doctor's office
(Hogan, Eppig, & Waldo, 1995). Such differences in the
quantity and quality of care may put older adults without
private insurance at increased risk of health problems, in-
cluding disability.
We used a community sample to examine the impact of
private health insurance coverage on disability, controlling
for demographic characteristics, baseline health, and a vari-
ety of other risk factors (health behaviors and measures of
stress) that may be related to both insurance coverage and
disability. Using hierarchical regression techniques (Alwin
& Hauser, 1981), we also estimate the degree to which in-
surance coverage mediates the relationship between income
and disability. Six annual waves of follow-up data enable
us to use proportional hazards models to estimate the ef-
fects of our independent variables over a longer period of
time than has been possible in most prior studies of disabil-
ity among older people.
METHODS
Sample
We used data from the baseline (1986-87) and six annual
follow-up waves of the Duke Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), which were
carried out in one urban and four rural counties of North
Carolina (Comoni-Huntley, Blazer, Brock, & Farmer, 1990).
Of a stratified random household sample of community resi-
dents, 80% (4,162) responded, including an oversample of
African Americans. Data from the first, fourth, and seventh
waves were collected using personal interviews, while tele-
phone interviews were used for Waves 2, 3, 5, and 6. Details
of the sampling design and methods are published elsewhere
(Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991). In the analy-
ses, sampling weights were used to adjust for the oversam-
ple, differential sampling probabilities by household size,
and nonrandom nonresponse. Measures of several risk fac-
tors were not available for 162 respondents requiring inter-
views with proxies, reducing the sample to 4,000 nonproxy
respondents. Compared with others, the respondents who
required proxies were older, in poorer health, and more
likely to be disabled at baselipe.
Measures
Dependent variables.--Based on prior factor-analytic re-
sults (Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993, 1994), two disability
measures were coded using items from the modified Katz
activities of daily living (ADL) scale (Branch, Katz, Kniep-
mann, & Papsidero, 1984) and the Older Americans Re-
sources and Services (OARS) instrumental activities of
daily living (IADL) scale (Fillenbaum, 1988): (a) basic
ADL activities (bathing, dressing, transferring, using the
toilet) and (b) household ADLs (meal preparation, shop-
ping, housework). A third disability measure discussed by
Johnson and Wolinsky (1993)--the "advanced" ADLs--
was not used due to poor measurement properties. We also
used a measure of impaired mobility (climbing stairs, walk-
ing half a mile) developed by Guralnik and colleagues
(1993) from the Rosow-Breslau scale (Rosow & Breslau,
1966). Prior evidence (Landerman & Fillenbaum, 1997) in-
dicates these different dimensions of disability relate differ-
ently to risk factors considered in this article. Each disabil-
ity measure is dichotomous and coded 1 if a respondent is
completely unable to perform one or more constituent tasks
or (for Katz) without help from another person or device.
Continuous outcome measures (the number of tasks the re-
spondent cannot perform) were not used due to consider-
able skew.
Table 1 gives descriptive statistics on the disability mea-
sures. Respondents disabled on a particular disability mea-
sure at baseline were excluded when the development of
that disability was the dependent variable. Impaired mobil-
ity, which has the highest prevalence at baseline (1 - .72 =
.28), also has the highest incidence rate (.46) over 6 years.
Impaired basic ADL had the lowest prevalence rate. The
basic ADL and mobility items were asked at all six follow-
up waves, while the household ADL items were asked at
only the two in-person follow-ups (Waves 4 and 7).
Independent variables.--In Figure 1, the independent
variables are arranged in a causal model consistent with
prior research (Bunker & Gomby, 1989; Feinstein, 1993;
House et al., 1994; Marmot, Kogevinas, & Elston, 1987;
Pincus & Callahan, 1994). Controlling for other demograph-
ics, SES may affect disability via the risk factors included at
Stage 2. Smoking (Guralnik & Kaplan, 1989), being over-
weight or underweight (Galanos, Pieper, Cornoni-Huntley,
Bales, & Fillenbaum, 1994), poor diet (Pincus & Callahan,
1994), and stress (House et al., 1994) have been shown to be
risk factors for disability, while moderate alcohol consump-
tion has been shown to be protective (Guralnik & Kaplan,
1989). In this study, we add private health insurance to the
model in order to determine whether it is a significant and

"Demographic controls include age, gender, race, rural residence, and marital status. Detailed information on specific measures is given in Table 2.
Health-related behaviors include smoking, alcohol consumption, body weight, and diet. Stress includes inadequate housing and living in an unsafe neigh-
borhood. Baseline health includes chronic conditions, hip fracture, cognitive problems, depression, and self-rated health. Health care utilization includes

overlooked risk factor for disability among older persons.
Medicaid coverage is also included as a control at Stage 2.
Because the Stage 2 risk factors may be correlated, it is im-
portant to estimate their effects controlling for one another.
Baseline health and patterns of health care utilization are in-
cluded in Stages 3 and 4 to enable us to determine whether
they mediate any effects of insurance coverage on disability.
Private coverage is measured by a single dummy variable
(coded 1 for those who report they are covered by any health
insurance plan other than Medicare or Medicaid). This single
self-report item was the only measure of private coverage
available to us. Although it is consistent with other studies
(e.g., Blustein, 1995), our measure of private coverage con-
tains more measurement error than would be present if ob-
jective, verifiable data were available. Because estimates of
an independent variable's regression effect are biased down-
ward when measurement error is present (Bollen, 1989), the
direction of bias in our analyses will be toward underestimat-
ing the impact of insurance coverage on disability.
The specific measures used for the independent variables
are described in Table 2. Socioeconomic status is assessed
by education and by total family income at baseline. As
noted above, some reviewers interpret findings of a linear
relationship between SES and health as evidence that the
poorer health of the poor is due primarily to factors other
than inadequate access to health care. In preliminary analy-
ses, we tested whether the effects of education and income
on disability were linear or nonlinear. Disability was re-
gressed on education in years, family income in dollars, the
demographic controls in Figure 1, and quadratic (squared)
terms for education and income. For each type of disability,
the quadratic term was significant (indicating significant
nonlinearity) for income but not for education. Additional
analyses (using dummy variables to contrast low-, middle-,
and upper-income respondents on disability) indicated that
the relationship between income and disability could be
modeled with a single dummy variable coded 1 for those
respondents with less than $5,000 in annual income.
Quadratic terms were also used to test for nonlinearities
in the effects of the other continuous independent variables.
Based on preliminary findings of nonlinear effects that
could not be modeled adequately with dichotomous vari-
ables, squared as well as linear terms for body mass and al-
cohol consumption were included in the regression models.
Body mass was based on self-reported height and weight.
Smoking was linearly related to disability. About 80% of
respondents were nondrinkers and most others drank in
moderation. This will limit our statistical power to detect
the effects of problem drinking. The measures of access to
health care are based on the Andersen and Newman (1973)
health care utilization model. Housing conditions and
neighborhood safety are based on respondent self-report.
The health index is based on the physician-assessed (dif-
ferential) health impact of five chronic conditions and their
symptoms: myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes
mellitus, stroke, and any cancer (Fillenbaum et al., 1993).
Thirty-six physicians rated health impact based on ques-
tionnaire items about the presence of specific conditions
and symptoms. The ratings were used to create an overall
health scale, and respondents were divided into 3 groups of
roughly equal size based on their scale scores. The CES-D
items (Radloff, 1977) in the Duke EPESE were dichoto-
mous. A score of 9 or more on this scale has been shown to
be equivalent to a score of 16 or more on the original CES-
D scale (Blazer et al., 1991). The health measures refer to
health at baseline, while the health care utilization mea-
sures refer to utilization during the year prior to the base-
line interview.
The correlation between the income dummy variable and
education (-.37) was not so high as to indicate problems
with collinearity. Additional collinearity diagnostics (vari-
ance inflation factors) indicated no collinearity problems
for these two measures of SES or for the other independent
variables entered into the multiple regression models.
Missing data.--The mean was imputed for independent
variables with less than 2% missing data. For items with
2-5% missing data, we imputed a regression-predicted score
based on the other independent variables in the regression
model (Dixon, 1983). For variables with 5% or more missing
data, we used the "predictive mean matching" method (Little,
1986), a stochastic regression technique for imputing missing
data. Stochastic imputation (the imputation of an error term
along with a predicted score) is designed to estimate the vari-
ance as well as the mean of the imputed variable with accu-
racy and, therefore, minimize bias in relevant tests of signifi-
INSURANCE COVERAGE AND DISABILITY S261
cance (David, Little, Samuhel, & Triest, 1986; Kalton &
Kasprzyk, 1986). Significance tests were adjusted to reflect
the number of nonmissing cases prior to imputation.
Income had more missing data (18.8%) than any other
independent variable. As reported elsewhere (Landerman,
Land, & Pieper, 1997), the predictive mean matching
method for imputing missing data on income has been ex-
tensively tested in the EPESE data. Results for the imputa-
tion model used here (which explained over 50% of the
variance in income) indicate that bias and distortion are
sufficiently minimal as to be nonproblematic with up to
20% missing data. As an additional check, we reestimated
our regression models without imputation but with missing
income values coded 1 on a missing data (dummy) indica-
tor variable. We also repeated our analyses replacing family
income with a subjective measure of income adequacy (in-

both reanalyses were consistent with those reported in the
next section of this article.
Statistical Analysis
Discrete-time hazard models (Allison, 1984, 1995) were
used for the longitudinal analysis of the first occurrence of
disability among those who were not disabled at baseline.
Respondents contribute an observation for each "interval"
(period between waves) at risk until an event (disability),
death, or censoring at the end of the study period (Allison,
1995). These intervals become the units of analysis in a
proportional odds model (Cox, 1972), and logistic regres-
sion is used to estimate the effects of predictors on the odds
of a future event among those who remain at risk. Because
respondents who died during the course of the study are re-
moved from the group at risk of disability, death is treated
as a "competing risk" (Allison, 1984) in the analyses. Sen-
sitivity analyses (described in the Results section) were em-
ployed to assess potential bias due to a positive association
between disability and attrition due to death.
For each type of disability, we estimated the four hierar-
chical logistic regression equations corresponding to the
stages in Figure 1:
(1) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls
+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress
(2) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls
+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress
+ Lacks Private Health Insurance
(3) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls
+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress
+ Lacks Private Health Insurance + Baseline Health
(4) Disability = Education + Income + Demographic Controls
+ Health Related Behaviors + Stress
+ Lacks Private Health Insurance + Baseline Health
+ Health Care Utilization
Equation 2 estimates the impact of health insurance cover-
age on disability controlling for SES, other demographics,
health related behaviors, and stress. Equation 1 is included
to enable us to determine the degree to which the effects of
education and income on disability are mediated by insur-
ance coverage. As shown by Alwin and Hauser (1981),
changes in the regression coefficients across hierarchical
equations indicate the degree to which effects in an initial
equation are mediated by predictors added in a subsequent
equation. In Equations 3 and 4, we add baseline health and
health care utilization to the model to determine the degree
to which the effects of insurance coverage are mediated by
baseline health and then by patterns of health care utiliza-
tion. Significance tests were performed using SUDAAN
(1989), a specialized software program that adjusts for
clustering and stratification in the sampling design.
RESULTS
Table 3 presents correlations between health insurance
coverage and the other independent variables in the design.
Compared with other respondents, those who lack private
insurance coverage are older and less educated; they are
also more likely to be African American, to earn less than
$5,000 per year, and to reside in a rural area. When these
demographics were entered together in a regression model
predicting coverage, each year of education increased the
odds of having coverage by about 13% (p < .01), while low
income respondents were four times as likely as others to
lack coverage (p < .01). Contrary to our expectation, those
respondents without insurance coverage are not consis-
tently more likely to engage in risky behavior: They are
more likely to be overweight and to cook with fat, but they
are less likely to smoke or drink. They are also more likely
to be on Medicaid and to live in inadequate housing or in
an unsafe neighborhood. On all measures except hip frac-
ture, those without private coverage were in poorer health
at baseline.

INSURANCE COVERAGE AND DISABILITY S263
whether individuals have private insurance. The lack of pri-
vate coverage is associated with putting off care due to
costs, receiving care in a hospital rather than a doctor's of-
fice or clinic, and in a public rather than a private health
care facility. Individuals who lack private coverage report
lower levels of satisfaction with the care they receive; they
also report more outpatient visits and more visits to an
emergency room, and they are less likely to see the same
provider each time.
Table 4 presents the effects of the independent variables
on the odds of an initial disability among those who were
not disabled at baseline. Coefficients are estimated control-
ling for the other predictors in each equation. Equation 2
gives the effects of insurance coverage controlling for de-
mographics, health related behaviors, and stress. Insurance
coverage is a significant predictor for each outcome, with
the odds of disability from 35% to 48% higher among those
without supplemental coverage. On the basic ADLs, the im-
pact of (no) insurance coverage (1.48) is equivalent to the
effect of being 4 years older (1.104). Effects of similar mag-
nitude (relative to age) are present for the household ADLs
and mobility.
Changes in the coefficients for income from Equation 1
to Equation 2 indicate that about 100*(.45-.32)/.45 = 29%
of its effect on the basic ADLs is mediated by (indirect via)
insurance coverage. The effect of income on mobility de-
clines by 37% from Equation 1 to Equation 2. For the
household ADLs, the (nonsignificant) coefficient for in-
come decreases by half across equations. Although the ef-
fects of education also decline from Equation 1 to Equation
2, decreases are smaller (< = 20%) than those for income.
In Equation 3, the effect of insurance coverage is reduced
by up to 100*(.48-.39)/.48 = 20%, with the inclusion of
baseline health, which is strongly related to subsequent dis-
ability. Insurance remains significant on two outcomes con-
trolling for baseline health, and a trend in the expected di-
rection is present for the household ADLs.
Other risk factors in Equation 3 are related to disability
as expected. For body mass, coefficients between 0 and 1,
together with coefficients greater than 1 for body mass
squared, reflect a U-shaped relationship where the odds of
each type of disability are elevated among underweight and
overweight respondents. Smoking is associated with im-
paired mobility only. Alcohol consumption is also related to
mobility, with nondrinkers and heavier drinkers at increased
risk. Inadequate housing is a risk factor for mobility. Mea-
sures of whether a respondent added salt to food, cooked
with fat, received Medicaid benefits, and suffered from de-
pression were not significant on any outcome and were

Notes: Data are weighted. Coefficients are logistic odds ratios estimating changes in the odds of first disability per unit change in a predictor. For each de-
pendent variable, those disabled at baseline are excluded. After excluding those disabled at baseline, the analyses were based on the following numbers of
cases: for the basic ADLs, 3,555; for the household ADLs, 3,150; for mobility, 2,650.
The following variables were removed from the final model when they had no significant effect on any dependent variable: Health-Related Behaviors: adds
salt to food, cooks with a lot of fat; Stress: unsafe neighborhood; Access to Care: covered by Medicaid; Health Care Utilization: number of visits to emergency
room, satisifaction with medical care, put off care due to cost, usually sees same provider, site of care is hospital (vs doctor's office or clinic), site of care is
public (vs private facility).
To trim leading zeroes in its regression effects, education is measured in 4-year increments.

tions are related to disability. Coefficients for insurance
coverage remain virtually unchanged from Equation 3 to
Equation 4, indicating that these measures of utilization do
not mediate the effects of insurance coverage on disability.
Initial disability versus subsequent disabilities.--For the
basic ADLs and mobility, we estimated models (results
available upon request) for second and third instances of
disability among those who suffered an initial disability, re-
covered, and reentered the risk set. (With only two follow-
up waves, the household ADLs did not provide sufficient
recovered cases for analysis.) Only age had statistically sig-
nificant effects that were similar (in direction and magni-
tude) to its effects in the model for initial disability. The
failure of our model to replicate for second and third dis-
abilities may be due to the small numbers (492 for the basic
ADLs) who became impaired, recovered, and reentered the
risk set. For mobility, where 894 respondents recovered and
reentered the risk set, the effect of insurance coverage was
in the expected direction, but did not reach significance. Or
it may be that the degree of recovery is more important
than social factors after an initial disability. Because our re-
sults were different for second and third disabilities, we do
not present "repeated events" models (Allison, 1995),
which combine initial and subsequent disabilities, and we
do not attempt to generalize our findings from initial to sub-
sequent disabilities.
Disability and mortality.--Survival models can produce
biased results when censoring is substantial and related to
the event of interest (Allison, 1995; Gelman, Gelber, Hen-
derson, Coleman, & Harris, 1990; Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski,
& Hiris, 1994). Thirty percent of our baseline sample died
by the sixth follow-up wave, and additional analyses (avail-
able upon request) showed that mortality was positively re-
lated to each type of disability. Although the biasing effects
of censoring due to death cannot be modeled explicitly and
corrected, Allison (1995) describes a sensitivity analysis
that can be used to assess the severity of the problem. Mod-
els for disability are first reestimated; cases censored due to
death are treated as if they became disabled at the time of
censoring. The models are reestimated again; those who
died are treated as if they did not experience disability and
are assigned a time of censoring equal to the longest cen-
soring time in the sample (here, censoring after six follow-
up waves). If parameter estimates from the original analysis
resemble parameter estimates when mortality is treated in
these two extreme ways, one can conclude that bias due to
the association between disability and death is negligible.
For all predictors except gender and smoking, parameter
estimates from the sensitivity analyses were very close (in
direction, magnitude, and statistical significance) to those
in Table 4, indicating that bias due to the association be-
tween disability and mortality is minimal. Because being
female was strongly protective for mortality but not for dis-
ability, its effects on disability were biased in a protective
direction when mortality was coded as an event. Because
smoking was related to death but not to basic or household
ADL disability, it became a risk factor for these outcomes
(and the positive relationship between smoking and im-
paired mobility was inflated) when death was coded as an
event.
DISCUSSION
On the basic and household ADLs and mobility, those
without private health insurance were at increased risk of
disability. Controlling for demographic characteristics and
a variety of risk factors (smoking, drinking, diet, body
mass, stress) that have attracted considerably more atten-
tion than insurance coverage in prior studies, the odds of
disability were from 35% to 48% higher among those re-
spondents without private coverage. Private insurance cov-
erage, which was positively related to income, also medi-
ated the effects of income on disability. Across dependent
variables, the regression effects of income declined by 29%
or more when insurance coverage was added to the regres-
sion models.
Several observers have cited a linear relationship be-
tween socioeconomic status and health as evidence that the
poorer health of the socioeconomically disadvantaged is the
result of factors other than inadequate access to care (Adler,
Boyce, Chesney, Folkman, & Syme, 1993; Bunker &
Gomby, 1989; Pincus & Callahan, 1994). They reason that
inadequate access would result in a nonlinear income ef-
fect, with the poor at increased risk. The effects of income
on disability here were nonlinear, as they were in House et
al. (1990). Those in the bottom third of the income distribu-
tion, who were four times as likely as others to lack private
coverage, were at increased risk of disability.
The effects of other risk factors on disability were mostly
as expected. Being underweight or overweight increased
the odds of disability on all three outcomes. The effects of
smoking and alcohol consumption were limited to mobility,
but sensitivity analyses indicated that increased mortality
among smokers had probably attenuated its effects on the
dependent variables. Living in inadequate housing was also
associated with increased odds of disability.
Respondents without private coverage were more likely
to put off care due to costs, were more likely to receive care
in a hospital setting rather than a doctor's office or clinic
and in a public rather than a private facility, and were less
satisfied with the health care they received. However, these
differences were unrelated to disability and, therefore, did
not explain statistically the relationship of disability to in-
surance coverage; neither did measures of the amount of
outpatient and inpatient care received.
Findings from other studies suggest a variety of other
ways that the lack of insurance coverage may affect disabil-
ity by restricting access to appropriate care; however, the
absence of appropriate measures prevented us from investi-
gating these. Medicare recipients without private coverage
are less likely to receive preventive care, such as cancer
screening (Blustein, 1995). A randomized group of Medi-
care recipients given free preventive visits (not covered by
Medicare) made more preventive visits and showed im-
proved health compared to controls (German et al., 1995).
Among Medicare recipients, the lack of private coverage
adversely affects care for arthritis (Grana & Stuart, 1997),
lung cancer (Greenberg et al., 1988), and dental care (Man-
ski, 1994), and those without private insurance are in
INSURANCE COVERAGE AND DISABILITY S265
poorer health when they go for care (Mentnech et al.,
1995). Prescription drugs are not covered by Medicare, and
rates of prescription drug use are lower among older adults
without private health insurance (Fillenbaum et al., 1993).
It is also possible that the relationship between insurance
coverage and disability in our data is the result of their
common association with some unmodeled factor related to
access to care. Because the insurance effect remained sub-
stantial when baseline health was added to the models, it is
unlikely that differences in commitment to health and
health practices prior to age 65 will account for it the ef-
fects of insurance coverage. On the other hand, measure-
ment error may have limited our ability to fully control for
baseline health; also, a model that included measures of
health practices prior to age 65 might yield smaller insur-
ance effects.
Regular exercise, which is protective for disability (La-
Croix, Guralnik, Berkman, Wallace, & Satterfield, 1993),
may be positively related to insurance status, but was not
controlled due to the lack of an available measure. As dis-
cussed by Williams and Collins (1995), permanent wealth
in the form of assets may be a better indicator of financial
well-being than current income after age 65. No measure of
assets was available as a control, however, and the effect
of insurance on disability may reflect differences in finan-
cial assets. The fact that the insurance effect remained
unchanged when we substituted a subjective measure of
financial well-being for income (to test our imputation
method) provides some contrary evidence but does not re-
solve this issue.
Some other limitations of this study were mentioned ear-
lier. Measurement error in our self-report measure of pri-
vate health insurance coverage has likely attenuated the
measure's effects in our analyses. Respondents in the poor-
est health were excluded because relevant measures were
not collected in proxy interviews. For the basic ADLs and
mobility, the model for initial disability did not hold for
subsequent disabilities among those who recovered. For the
household ADLs, there was insufficient data to address this
issue. In this regard, it should also be noted that some re-
spondents may have experienced an episode of disability
and recovered prior to baseline. To the extent that this is the
case (and we are including subsequent disabilities in our
model for initial disabilities), the direction of bias would
be toward finding no significant effects except age. In ad-
dition, our findings are based on a regional rather than a
national sample. As noted earlier, low rates of alcohol con-
sumption in North Carolina may have attenuated our esti-
mates of its effects on the development of disability. The
impact of private insurance on health might also vary by
region, based on the characteristics of local health care
systems.
The relationship between private insurance and disability
merits particular attention with respect to public policy. If
this relationship reflects differences in access to care, it
suggests that providing additional coverage to those with-
out private insurance (37% of our sample) would reduce
the odds of disability by up to 48% among those aged 65
and older. Alternatively, the relationship between private
health insurance and disability might be due to their com-
mon association with some unmodeled third factor, such as
exercise or financial assets. The evidence we were able to
bring to bear on this issue does not resolve the issue. Nev-
ertheless, we have found substantial differences in the rate
of disability between respondents with and respondents
without supplemental insurance coverage. Other studies
provide considerable evidence that older adults without pri-
vate coverage do not have equal access to health care.
Taken together, these findings are evidence that the impact
of insurance coverage on the health of older persons de-
serves a great deal more attention than it has received in
prior studies dealing with risk factors for disability and
their policy implications.
