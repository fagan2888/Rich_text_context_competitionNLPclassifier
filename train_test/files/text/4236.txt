Introduction
Immigration in Canada
Changes in immigration laws in 1966 led to a substantial rise
in the number of Asian immigrants to Canada (A. H. Kim,
2008). About 3.7% of the total Canadian population is
Chinese immigrants (Statistics Canada, 2007). Korean immi-
grants came to Canada in increasing numbers over the past
two decades, and they now represent 0.3% of the total
Canadian population. However, the size of the Korean
Canadian population is increasing faster with a growth rate
of 53%, compared to 19% growth in the Chinese Canadian
population and only 4% growth for the general population
between 1996 and 2001 (A. H. Kim, 2008; M. Kwak &
Hiebert, 2010; Statistics Canada, 2007).
In Ontario, 90% of Korean Canadians and Chinese
Canadians reside in four of the fourteen health regions within
the province: Mississauga Halton, Toronto Central, Central,
and Central East (Ontario Association of Community Care
Access Centers, 2010). These regions have clusters of
Chinese or Korean neighborhoods providing access to infor-
mal support networks with shared cultural heritages.
However, formal service providers may also provide culture-
specific services (e.g., Chinese- and Korean-speaking care
coordinators). In other regions of Ontario, these useful ser-
vices may not be readily available.
Acculturation
Immigrants become more acculturated to a host culture over
time, but only when it occurs at young age (Cheung, Chudek,
& Heine, 2011). Better language acquisition among young
immigrants is an important contributor to this adaptation
(Hakuta, Bialystok, & Wiley, 2003). Conversely, immigra-
tion later in life is stressful because of cultural adjustments
and language barriers that are likely to be more severe (Mui,
1996, 2001). Challenges such as discrimination, communi-
cation difficulties, lack of social resources, and feelings of
detachment in the society may affect adaptation to the host
environment (Bernstein, Park, Shin, Cho, & Park, 2011;
Kiefer, Kum, & Choi, 1985; Lai & Chau, 2007; Mui, 2001).
Elderly Asian immigrants often lack information and prepa-
ration to adjust to the major changes in cultural norms and
social conditions (Mui, 1996, 2001). About 6% of Korean
immigrants and 10% of Chinese immigrants are aged above
65 (Statistics Canada, 2006, 2007). Thus, elderly immigrants

A Cross-Sectional Study to Compare
Caregiver Distress Among Korean
Canadian, Chinese Canadian, and Other
Canadian Home Care Clients
Byung Wook Chang1 and John P. Hirdes1
Abstract
This study examines the health of elderly Korean Canadians in home care and investigates the risk factors for caregiver
distress of families caring for their elderly relatives. Korean Canadians, Chinese Canadians, and other Canadian home care
clients were compared using the Resident Assessment Instrument­Home Care (RAI-HC). The assessments were done as a
part of normal clinical practice between January 2002 and December 2010 within Ontario. A sample of 58,557 home care
clients was analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square analysis at the bivariate level and multiple logistic regression
models. The major finding of the present study is that Korean clients had higher physical impairments and higher prevalence
of major chronic diseases, but they were less likely to receive personal support or nursing services. Moreover, the results
provide clear evidence of the importance of language barriers for all linguistic minorities, including Korean Canadians.

are a minority within a minority, making them a vulnerable
and understudied group (Ma, Chu, & Tsou, 2002).
Cultural Values
The traditional Korean culture, similar to Chinese culture,
places family as a focal point of social organization and
encourages family well-being and interdependence (Lai,
2007). Korean culture, based on familism, is strongly kin-
ship-oriented and discourages individual needs and desires
(Chun, Knight, & Youn, 2007; J. Kim & Lee, 2003). The
core value of family obligation involves the Confucian tradi-
tion of filial piety (Hanzawa et al., 2010; A. H. Kim, 2010;
Roh, 2010), which emphasizes that children must respect
and give thoughtful attention to their elders for giving birth
and rearing them into adulthood (Han, Choi, Kim, Lee, &
Kim, 2008; A. H. Kim, 2010; J. Kim & Lee, 2003; Lai,
2007). Thus, institutionalization or receiving external health
or social services may be viewed negatively in this culture
(A. H. Kim, 2010, G. Kwak & Lai, 2012). These social val-
ues promote an intense moral obligation to support aged par-
ents. In addition, Asian culture values stoicism and patience,
which encourages keeping feelings in rather than expressing
them and experiencing sorrow silently (Pang, 1995).
Cultural Values and Immigration
Immigrants experience cultural changes as a result of the
process of acculturation or the interaction between the origi-
nal and the new culture (Berry, 2006; W. Kim, 2002). Western
culture, unlike Korean culture, emphasizes individualistic
lifestyles and values independence and personal freedom
(Choi, 1993; Hanson, Sauer, & Seelbach, 1983; Y. Lee, 1995;
Spence, 1985). Some North American studies suggest that a
continuation of traditional Korean values after immigration
encourages families to care for and live with their aged par-
ents (Jun, 2005; A. H. Kim, 2010; Park, 2012; Yoo, 2014;
Yoo & Kim, 2010). However, there is also evidence of
changes in values toward a greater focus on independence,
autonomy, and youth (Wong, Yoo, & Stewart, 2006; Yoo,
2014). The likelihood of this change is affected by the age at
immigration, the length of exposure to lifestyles of other cul-
tures, and education levels (Hyun, 2001). As more adult chil-
dren integrate into Western society, one might expect the use
of formal health care services such as home care to increase
among older Koreans.
Despite these changes, there is clear evidence that family
members still provide substantial levels of support to elderly
family members living with them to avoid reliance on out-
side assistance (A. H. Kim, 2010, G. Kwak & Lai, 2012; M.
Lee, Yoon, & Kropf, 2007). Family members caring for older
adults may experience caregiver distress in the form of phys-
ical, psychological, emotional, social, and financial stress
(A. H. Kim, 2010; G. Kwak & Lai, 2012; Lai, 2008; H. Lee
& Singh, 2010). The likelihood of caregiver distress has been
shown to be related to cognitive and functional status of the
elderly (Chang & Horrocks, 2006; S. Kim et al., 2006; Lim,
Son, Song, & Beattie, 2008).
Many studies, regarding the gender differences, cultural
predictors, use of formal services, and service barriers, have
been conducted on Chinese Canadian caregivers (Chappell
& Kusch, 2007; Chappell & Funk, 2011; Ho, Friedland,
Rappolt, & Noh, 2003; Lai, 2007, 2008, 2009a, 2009b; Lai &
Leonenko, 2007; Lai, Luk, &Andruske, 2007; Lai & Surood,
2010; J. Lee & Bell, 2011). However, only a limited number
of studies are available for Korean Canadian caregivers. A
few studies investigate living arrangements and social sup-
port for older Korean immigrants (A. H. Kim, 2010;
G. Kwak, 2010; G. Kwak & Lai, 2012), and one thesis exists
on Korean informal caregiver distress in Canada (Jun, 2005).
Research Questions
The Andersen­Newman behavioral model of use of health
services postulates that culture and ethnicity is one of the
predisposing factors that can affect health service use
(Andersen, 1995). Thus, the traditional culture and the pro-
cess of acculturation would be expected to have important
implications for the use of health services by Korean immi-
grants. The key questions of interest in the present study are
whether Korean Canadian home care clients differ in their
levels of need, access to services, and rates of caregiver dis-
tress compared with Chinese Canadians and the general pop-
ulation of home care clients.
Although the present study will not test for the causal
pathways between access to health service and cultural val-
ues, it will provide the most detailed Canadian data available
to date on characteristics associated with differences in ser-
vice use and caregiver distress among the two main subpopu-
lations of Asian Canadians.
Chinese Canadian clients were selected as a comparison
group because they have some similarities to Koreans in
terms of norms related to filial piety, community orienta-
tion, and religious/cultural heritage. However, there are also
important differences between these groups that suggest
they should not be combined a priori as a homogeneous cul-
tural minority (e.g., recency of migration, size of diaspora in
Canada).
Method
Sample
This study was based on secondary analyses of de-identified
data for all long-stay home care clients assessed as part of
normal clinical practice by health professionals in 14 Ontario
Community CareAccess Centers (CCAC) using the Resident
Assessment Instrument­Home Care (RAI-HC; Canadian
Institute for Health Information, 2014b). CCAC are single
entry point agencies funded by the Ontario Ministry of
Chang and Hirdes 3
Health and Long-Term Care that evaluate the need for and
provide access to the care that vulnerable persons need in
home and community settings. RAI-HC assessments exam-
ined here were completed between January 2002 and
December 2010. Personal identifiers, such as name and
health card number, were stripped from the record or
encrypted in a way that would prevent identification prior to
the transmission of the data to the research group, and unique
client identifiers were given by the Ontario Association of
CCAC. For all CCAC clients, assessments were performed
by trained health professionals (e.g., care coordinators and
nurses) as part of the standard clinical practice done on
admission and thereafter every 6 months or on significant
clinical change. Missing data were generally not a major
concern given that the assessment is a mandatory require-
ment and the data were used by multiple stakeholders who
require complete data.
The study sample was drawn from the population of all
long-stay home care clients admitted during the study period
(N = 705,922). Using a variable for primary language, it was
possible to identify clients whose primary language was
Korean (1,017) or Chinese (11,508). All clients from both
groups were retained for the present study to maximize the
power to detect differences for each subgroup compared with
the general population. However, given that the other home
care clients included almost 690,000 cases, a subset was ran-
domly selected to yield a comparison group of 46,032 clients
who had a primary language other than Chinese or Korean. A
guideline of 4 times greater than the largest subgroup
(Chinese Canadians) was used to set the sample size for the
comparison group, which is consistent with methods used in
the case-control literature (Grimes & Schulz, 2005).
Data Source
RAI-HC is a person-centered assessment system developed
for use with adults in home and community-based settings
that has been shown to have good reliability and validity
(Hirdes, Ljunggren et al., 2008; Landi et al., 2000; Morris,
Carpenter, Berg, & Jones, 1997). The instrument focuses on
the person's functioning and quality of life by assessing
needs, strengths, and preferences in a broad range of domains
consisting of more than 300 items.
Two RAI-HC items were used to define caregiver dis-
tress: "A caregiver is unable to continue in caring activities,
e.g., decline in the health of the caregiver makes it difficult
to continue," and "Primary caregiver expresses feelings of
distress, anger, or depression." The presence of either of
these indicators was considered indicative of potential dis-
tress. Although the first indicator may be caused by other
factors (e.g., aging of the caregiver), it will also include
health declines associated with caregiver burden. These
items on caregiver distress have been used previously to
develop the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe)
decision support algorithm for prioritization of home care
clients' access to community and facility-based health ser-
vices (Hirdes, Poss, & Curtin-Telegdi, 2008).
Ethnicity was obtained from the RAI-HC assessment
item on preferred language. Care coordinators completing
the assessment used standard language codes provided by
the Canadian Institute for Health Information as part of the
Home Care Reporting System technical specification
(Canadian Institute for Health Information, 2014a). In addi-
tion, the "need for an interpreter" item was assessed directly
based on the client's or caregiver's response; hence, it was
not inferred from the client's ethnicity.
The items describing the profile of health and health
service use for Korean Canadians, Chinese Canadians, and
other Canadians were chosen based on a paper by Hirdes,
Mitchell, Maxwell, and White (2011). These items are
commonly used to describe health status and health service
use.
Several summary scales can be derived from RAI-HC
assessments to described a client's health and functional sta-
tus. The Activities of Daily Living Hierarchy (ADLH) Scale
measures physical disability, with scores ranging from 0 (no
impairment) to 6 (total dependence) by considering perfor-
mance in early loss (e.g., dressing) to late loss (e.g., eating)
ADLs (Landi et al., 2000; Morris, Fries, & Morris, 1999;
Morris et al., 1997). The Changes in Health, End-stage dis-
ease and Signs and Symptoms (CHESS) Scale identifies
individuals at risk of serious health decline, with scores rang-
ing from 0 (not at all unstable) to 5 (highly unstable;
Armstrong, Stolee, Hirdes, & Poss, 2010; Hirdes, Frijters, &
Teare, 2003). The Cognitive Performance Scale (CPS) is
based on memory impairment, level of consciousness, and
executive function, with scores ranging from 0 (intact) to 6
(very severe impairment; Landi et al., 2000; Morris et al.,
1994). The Depression Rating Scale (DRS) screens for
depressive symptoms with values ranging from 0 (no depres-
sive symptoms) to 14 (severe depressive symptoms; Burrows,
Morris, Simon, Hirdes, & Phillips, 2000; Szczerbiska,
Hirdes, & Zyczkowska, 2011). The Instrumental ADL capac-
ity (IADL) Scale, which ranges from 0 to 6, considers meal
preparation, ordinary housework, and phone use, with higher
scores indicating greater difficulty in IADL (Morris,
Carpenter, Berg, & Jones, 2000). The interRAI Pain Scale
uses frequency and intensity of pain to create a score from 0
to 3 (Fries, Simon, Morris, Flodstrom, & Bookstein, 2001).
Finally, the Method for Assigning Priority Levels (MAPLe)
decision support algorithm ranges from low to very high
with higher scores indicating greater needs. MAPLe has
been shown to predict nursing home placement, caregiver
distress, and ratings that the "client would be better off in
other living environment" in many different international
jurisdictions (Hirdes, Poss et al., 2008). MAPLe has also
been validated as a predictor of institutionalization from
acute hospital settings (Noro et al., 2011). Hence, all scales
used in the present analyses have good reliability and valid-
ity, and are positively associated with impairment (Morris
4 SAGE Open
et al., 1999; Morris et al., 1997; Hirdes, Ljunggren et al.,
2008; Landi et al., 2000). Studies with interRAI instruments
in Asian countries have also reported similar results (see, for
example, Chi, 2011; Chi, Chou, Kwan, Lam, & Lam, 2006;
Chou & Chi, 2008; Kang, Lee, Kim, Park, & Yoon, 2008;
Kwan, Chi, Lam, Lam, & Chou, 2000).
Scores on the summary scales were divided into different
categories using cutoffs previously used by Hirdes et al.
(2011). These scale cutoffs were specified prior to examining
caregiver distress.
RAI-HC has been mandated for use in eight Canadian
provinces and territories (Canadian Home Care
Association, 2008). It has been used extensively in other
countries including Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Sweden, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, and England (see, for example, Carpenter
et al., 2004; Sørbye et al., 2009). In addition to its clinical
applications for care planning and outcome measurement,
RAI-HC can also be used for case-mix classification
(Björkgren, Fries, & Shugarman, 2000; Poss, Hirdes,
Fries, McKillop, & Chase, 2008) and quality measure-
ment (Bos et al., 2007; Dalby, Hirdes, & Fries, 2005;
Hirdes et al., 2004).
Ethics Clearance
Ethics clearance for secondary analysis of the data was
obtained through the University of Waterloo, Office of
Human Research.
Statistical Analysis
To provide a descriptive profile of the health of elderly
Korean Canadians in home care, data were analyzed first to
obtain percentage and frequency distributions. Bivariate dif-
ferences in socio-demographic, clinical, caregiving, and
health service use characteristics by ethnicity were evaluated
with chi-square analysis using a two-tailed test with an alpha
level of .05. In addition, temporal effects were examined
using 2002 as a reference year, but no significant differences
were found over time in the key dependent variable of inter-
est (caregiver distress).
The bivariate analyses reported in Tables 1 to 4 were used
to identify how the three cultural groups differed with respect
to important clinical and service use variables. The MAPLe
algorithm in Table 5 provides a risk adjustment variable that
incorporates most of the important clinical scales and items
referred to in the earlier tables.
To investigate the risk factors for caregiver distress, crude
and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for caregiver distress were obtained from mul-
tiple logistic regression models. Summary scales were
treated as continuous variables when tested in models. All
statistical analyses were performed using SAS software
(Version 9.4).
Results
Table 1 shows the percentage of home care clients with
selected socio-demographic, diagnostic, and health charac-
teristics by language group. In this and subsequent tables, the
large sample sizes result in relatively modest differences
being statistically significant, although they may sometimes
not be clinically significant. Therefore, the emphasis here is
placed on the larger differences that are clinically significant
and have relevance for policy or clinical practice. In terms of
overall characteristics, the Korean Canadians, Chinese
Canadians, and other Canadian home care clients had a com-
parable age distribution. However, Korean Canadian clients
had a somewhat higher percentage of women, and Korean
Canadian and Chinese Canadian males were substantially
more likely to be married than other male home care clients.
The distributions of medical diagnoses were relatively com-
parable across the three groups, except Korean Canadian and
Chinese Canadian clients had notably lower rates of heart
failure than other clients. On the other hand, Chinese
Canadian clients had the highest rates of other cardiovascular
diseases (53.8%, p < .01). Korean Canadian clients had
slightly higher rates of falls in last 90 days (38.1%, p < .05)
and higher rates of unsteady gait (62.5%, p < .001) compared
with the other groups. In addition, Korean Canadian and
Chinese Canadian clients were less likely to walk or bathe
independently compared with other clients. Loss of appetite
(15%, p < .001) was most common in the Korean Canadian
clients, and trouble swallowing was about double the rate in
Korean Canadians (15.9%) and Chinese Canadians (19%)
compared with other home care clients (8.9%, p < 0.001).
Moreover, Korean Canadian clients had the highest rates of
mental health symptoms such as anxiety symptoms, delir-
ium, any aggressive behavior, and hallucinations or delu-
sions. The rates of expressive and receptive deficits in
communication were also highest in Korean Canadian
clients.
Three indicators were used to assess social variables:
"Made economic trade-offs," "Conflict with others," and
"Social isolation." Korean Canadian clients were about twice
as likely to make economic trade-offs among purchasing
food, medication, housing, and necessary medical care com-
pared with the other two groups. In addition, rates of social
isolation were comparable among the three groups, but "con-
flict with others" was most common in the Korean Canadian
clients. The most dramatic difference across groups was the
need for translation, where about 80% of Korean Canadians
and Chinese Canadians needed an interpreter compared with
only 8% of other home care clients (p < .0001).
Table 2 provides the distribution of selected informal
caregiving variables by language group. The rates of care-
giver distress were highest in the Korean Canadian clients
(25.9%) and lowest in the other clients (17.3%, p < .001).
Korean Canadians and Chinese Canadians were much less
likely to live alone or to live only with their spouse compared
Chang and Hirdes 5
with other clients. On the other hand, both minority groups
were about twice as likely as other home care clients to either
"live with their spouse and child" or "live with their child
only." Similarly, Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian
clients were also much more likely to live with their primary
and secondary caregivers than other clients. Both the pri-
mary and secondary caregivers were more likely to be a child
than in other home care clients; however, they were also sub-
stantially less likely to have caregivers who were other rela-
tives or friend/neighbors.

Table 3 provides the distribution of various clinical algo-
rithms and scale scores by ethnicity. Although the three
groups had similar distributions for pain, health instability
(measured by the CHESS Scale), and depressive symptoms,
there were clear differences with respect to cognitive and
functional status. Korean Canadian clients had the highest
percentage with a CPS score greater than 3 (20.7%, p < .001),
indicating a moderate or worse impairment in cognition.
With respect to ADL impairment, they had about twice the
proportion of moderate or worse functional status compared
with other home care clients (about 18% compared with
10%, respectively, p < .001). Similarly, Korean Canadian
and Chinese Canadian home care clients' IADL capacity
scale scores indicated higher rates of impairment in instru-
mental activities than other clients. These differences are
also reflected in the MAPLe algorithm, which is a composite
measure combining factors such as ADL impairment, cogni-
tion, falls, IADL, and behavior. Korean Canadians had the
largest proportion in the two highest MAPLe categories
(43.4%, p < .001) compared with Chinese Canadian and
other clients.
Table 4 provides the percentage of home care clients
receiving selected health services and clinical interventions
by ethnicity. A somewhat higher percentage of Korean
Canadian clients received occupational therapy (19.1%, p <
.05), but they were less likely to receive personal support or
homemaking services (37.6%, p < .001) compared with
Chinese Canadian and other clients. There were only modest
differences between groups in emergency visits and hospital-
izations; however, Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian
clients were much less likely to receive medical interven-
tions such as oxygen therapy, nurse monitoring, and wound
care. In addition, both groups had a much lower rate of use of
psychotropic medications (except antipsychotics) than other
home care clients.
Table 5 presents the results for various multiple logistic
regression models investigating the associations of ethnicity
and the need for an interpreter with caregiver distress. The
models also adjust for other factors that may be associated
with caregiver distress including MAPLe, age, sex, marital
status, and receipt of personal support services. When their
main effects are considered alone, the language variable was
significantly associated with caregiver distress with or with-
out the adjustments for other covariates (Korean Canadian
unadjusted OR = 1.67, 95% CI = [1.45, 1.93]; adjusted OR =
1.40, 95% CI = [1.19, 1.64]; Chinese Canadian unadjusted
OR = 1.45, 95% CI = [1.38, 1.52]; adjusted OR = 1.28, 95%
CI = [1.22, 1.36]). When the reference group was changed to
be Chinese Canadians rather than the general home care pop-
ulation, the CI for Korean Canadian clients overlapped with
1.00 slightly, and the p value was .07, indicating that the dif-
ference between the two Asian groups did not quite meet the
0.05 level of significance, although both clearly had higher
rates of distress than the general home care population.
Chang and Hirdes 7
The need for an interpreter was also significantly associ-
ated with caregiver distress with or without adjustments for
other covariates (unadjusted OR = 1.67, 95% CI = [1.60,
1.75]; adjusted OR = 1.41, 95% CI = [1.34, 1.48]). However,
when both variables were introduced as covariates in the
caregiver distress model, the language variable was no lon-
ger significant but the interpreter needed variable remained
significant (unadjusted OR = 1.69, 95% CI = [1.58, 1.80];
adjusted OR = 1.40, 95% CI = [1.30, 1.51]). Language barri-
ers were significant irrespective of order of entry to the
model, and statistical tests of collinearity indicated that this
was not a major concern for these variables. Indeed, given
that ethnicity and need for an interpreter are not indicators of
the same underlying concept, they should not be considered
to be multicollinear items.
The analysis shows that it is the language barrier and
not "Chinese-ness or Korean-ness" that is a key factor
associated with caregiver distress. Interactions between
ethnicity and the need for an interpreter were also tested.
These interactions were found to be significant, and the
adjusted ORs are shown in Figure 1. For all three different
ethnic clients, the need for an interpreter was associated
with a higher level of caregiver distress. For those who do
not need an interpreter, Korean Canadian clients had
somewhat lower odds of distress and Chinese Canadians
had higher odds of distress compared with the general
population of home care clients. On the other hand, the
odds of caregiver distress were highest among Korean
Canadian clients requiring an interpreter.
Figure 2 shows the rates of caregiver distress by MAPLe
priority levels and cultural groups. For all three groups,
MAPLe is clearly associated with an increased rate of
caregiver distress. In addition, the rates of distress are
higher within MAPLe levels for the Korean Canadian and

impairment, incontinence, and mental health symptoms.
Korean Canadian clients also had a higher incidence of major
chronic diseases, including diabetes, cancer, and other cardio-
vascular diseases. They also had notably higher levels of
functional and cognitive impairments than other home care
clients. Despite their higher need for support services, Korean
Canadians were less likely to receive personal supports/
homemaking and home nursing. These results suggest the
possibility that they begin to receive help from formal ser-
vices too late, and consequently, their caregivers experience

high levels of distress. It is also clear that language barriers
are a major risk factor to elevated distress in both cultural
groups examined here.
As one might expect based on Confucian values, higher
percentages of children took care of and lived with the
Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients compared
with the general home care population. These living arrange-
ments may have allowed for the exchange of intergenera-
tional support (e.g., grandparents may have provided child
care in the home to allow both parents to work). Prior sup-
port by grandparents may therefore be repaid by assistance
from their children as they become frailer in later life.
However, with increased female labor force participation, it
may be stressful for employed adult children in multigenera-
tional households to provide care to both their children and
elderly parents.
Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients were less
likely to have emergency visits and hospitalizations. These
lower rates may mean that they are being managed well at
home. On the other hand, these findings may also demon-
strate the stoicism that delays seeking help for pain or dis-
comfort caused by health conditions. It is also possible that
Eastern medicines and therapies might be used instead of
conventional health care services. Finally, some elders may
avoid visits to emergency departments because of language
barriers that discourage the service use.
It is also clear from this study that there were high rates of
informal caregiver distress in these groups, indicating that
these caregivers are not impervious to the challenges of sup-
porting relatives with heavy care needs. Korean Canadian
clients had the highest unadjusted rate of caregiver distress
among these ethnic clients, a finding that is consistent with
those reported by other studies (E. E. Lee & Farran, 2004).
This difference was due, at least in part, to the substantially
higher levels of impairments evident in the Korean Canadian
clients. However, compared with the general population,
rates of caregiver distress were higher in both cultural groups
after adjusting for need and socio-demographic factors.
The present results also point to the critical importance of
language barriers for home care clients and their caregivers.
Other studies have reported that language barriers were the
most frequently experienced and the most common adapta-
tion difficulties among immigrants (Koh & Bell, 1987; Mui,
1996; Wong, Yoo, & Stewart, 2005). The present results
demonstrate that these difficulties carry over to the experi-
ence of informal caregivers. In fact, the multivariable logistic
regression analyses indicated that the significance of ethnic
differences disappears when the need for an interpreter is
included. Thus, targeting language barriers can be a start in
reducing distress experienced by home care clients and care-
givers from cultural minorities. However, if these needs are
not properly met or managed, they can lead to social isola-
tions and other barriers in living in the community.
Consequently, addressing language issues is a fundamental
requirement for any home care agency serving clients in a
multicultural society.
One of the objectives of this study was to investigate the
risk factors for caregiver distress of families caring for the
elderly members. After controlling for clinical indicators of
need, the main risk factor that affected caregiver distress was
the need for an interpreter for the clients. Lack of language
support such as translation services can be discriminatory to
minority groups who do not speak the official language of
the dominant culture. The failure of government to provide
such services can exacerbate health outcomes in these popu-
lations (Woloshin, Bickell, Schwartz, Gany, & Welch, 1995).
Language barriers can influence understanding and absorp-
tion of information leading to social isolation and causing
psychosocial distress and health declines in the elderly indi-
viduals who immigrated later in life (Colenda & Smith,
1993; M. S. Lee, 1989; Lai & Surood, 2010; Mui, 2001).
Moreover, language barriers impair social function, a prob-
lem that may in turn lower self-esteem, a sense of security
and control, access to important information, ability to make
friends, and participate in the community (Antle, 2004).
The findings related to the MAPLe algorithm are also of
interest because they demonstrate that it continues to be a
predictor of caregiver distress within cultural groups.
Therefore, home care agencies serving diverse populations
may be reassured that the algorithm indicates need for ser-
vices to be provided in a manner that is not culturally con-
strained. The higher levels of distress within MAPLe levels
among Korean Canadian and Chinese Canadian clients were
no longer significant after adjusting for the need for an inter-
preter. This suggests that home care agencies should provide
services that target the dimensions of need operationalized
by the MAPLe algorithm, and they must do so in a manner
that is sensitive to cultural and linguistic considerations.
For multicultural societies, it is essential to account for
linguistic diversity as part of health and social service deliv-
ery. Cultural competence should be a basic requirement for
home care workers and other health care providers, but prac-
tical provisions to deal with language barriers are also funda-
mental considerations. Language barriers may pose important
problems for issues such as health literacy, awareness of ser-
vice options, self-determination, self-esteem, and compli-
ance with treatment regimens (Damron-Rodriguez, Wallace,
& Kington, 1995; Woloshin et al., 1995).
Finally, it is important to underline that language barriers
are important considerations not only for Korean Canadian
and Chinese Canadian clients, but also for other linguistic
minorities. The increased distress associated with the need for
an interpreter was also evident within the comparison group
of other home care clients. Hence, this is not a problem unique
to Canadians of Asian origin. However, there are only a lim-
ited number of governmental language training programs that
target older immigrants in Canada (Immigrant Settlement &
Integration Services, 2010). Thus, governments should pro-
vide supports to reach out to isolated minority populations of
older adults to prevent further deterioration of their health,
enhance their quality of life, and support caregivers, making a
valuable social and economic contribution to society.

Limitations
The cross-sectional nature of the data set used here limits
one's ability to make causal inferences in these findings, but
the multidimensional nature of the RAI-HC assessment per-
mitted adjustments for many different potential confounders.
Second, there may be errors involved in the ascertainment of
clinical characteristics such as depressive symptoms or care-
giver distress, which in turn may have weakened some asso-
ciations of interest. However, Chi (2011) argued that the
interRAI instruments are well-suited for cross-cultural
assessment of the needs of older adults. Third, fluency in
other languages was not considered because only the primary
language was assessed in the RAI-HC. Fourth, the ascertain-
ment of caregiver distress was a binary variable, so the sub-
jective severity of the distress cannot be determined beyond
its presence or absence. However, other articles have used
the same variable to examine caregiver distress (Hirdes,
Freeman, Smith, & Stolee, 2012; Hirdes, Poss, & Curtin-
Telegdi, 2008). Fifth, the immigrant sample being investi-
gated involved only those who were part of long-stay home
care programs. Thus, the results may not be generalizable to
community-dwelling Korean Canadian and Chinese
Canadian older adults not receiving formal home care
services.
Despite these limitations, the present study suggests that
Korean Canadian home care clients have higher impair-
ments, but receive fewer services than other clients. Korean
Canadians are one of the most rapidly increasing immigrant
populations in Canada. Therefore, the need to respond to the
systematic barriers identified here will likely grow over time.
