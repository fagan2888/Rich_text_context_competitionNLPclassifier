Introduction
The link between action and language has been widely
acknowledged by the scientific community. During the last
decade, several articles have been published reporting the
involvement of the motor (Buccino et al., 2005; Gerfo et al.,
2008; Repetto, Colombo, Cipresso, & Riva, 2013) and pre-
motor cortices (Boulenger, Hauk, & Pulvermuller, 2009;
Hauk, Johnsrude, & Pulvermuller, 2004; Kemmerer, Castillo,
Talavage, Patterson, & Wiley, 2008; Tettamanti et al., 2005;
Willems, Labruna, D'Esposito, Ivry, & Casasanto, 2011)
during language processing. Language learning is a cogni-
tive ability that entangles language and memory, and is suit-
able for investigation within this theoretical frame. In fact, it
has been highlighted that foreign language learning is
enhanced by linking verbal and action information (see
Macedonia & von Kriegstein, 2012, for an extensive review).
How to investigate this link poses an interesting method-
ological question. We know that verbal information is usu-
ally communicated by words or sentences, whereas action
information is derived from gestures. After a review of the
key points of traditional studies on action information and
language learning, the present study will focus on the feasi-
bility of using simulation as an alternative, innovative
method to explore these same processes.
The impact of gestures on verbal memory has been stud-
ied for decades as gestures are fundamental in second
language acquisition. Engelkamp and Zimmer (1985), for
example, reported that the recall of action words or sentences
is improved if, during the learning phase, the subjects panto-
mime the corresponding action. These results emerged by
comparing the language acquisition rate to a control condi-
tion in which subjects could only hear/read the action items.
This "enactment effect" not only increased the number of
items correctly remembered but also improved the accessi-
bility of the memorized items, as proven using recognition
tasks (Kronke, Mueller, Friederici, & Obrig, 2013; Masumoto
et al., 2006; Noice & Noice, 2001). Recent neuropsychologi-
cal studies provide further evidence. A recent functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study (Miyahara,
Kitada, Sasaki, Okamoto, Tanabe, & Sadato, 2013) investi-
gated the neural substrates involved in the effect of spontane-
ous verbal labeling when memorizing increasingly complex
sequences of hand movements. Results showed that the use

Is Motor Simulation Involved During
Foreign Language Learning? A Virtual
Reality Experiment
Claudia Repetto1, Barbara Colombo1,2, and Giuseppe Riva1,3
Abstract
This article presents a study performed to investigate the role of simulation in second language learning while using a
virtual environment. Participants were asked to explore a virtual park while learning 15 new Czech verbs (action verbs that
describe movements performed with either the hand or the foot, and abstract verbs). This learning condition was compared
with a baseline condition, where movements (either virtual or real) were not allowed. The goal was to investigate whether
the virtual action (performed with the feet) would promote or interfere with the learning of verbs describing actions that
were performed with the same or a different effector. The number of verbs correctly remembered in a free recall task was
computed, along with reaction times and number of errors during a recognition task. Results show that the simulation per
se has no effect in verbal learning, but the features of the virtual experience mediate it.

of verbal labels would reduce neuronal activity in imitation-
related regions, such as the left inferior frontal gyrus. As fur-
ther confirmation of these findings, Straube and colleagues
(2014), relying on behavioral and fMRI data, reported the
activation of different neural substrates (left temporal pole
and middle cingulate cortex vs. posterior thalamic structures
and anterior and posterior cingulate cortices) for processing
related and unrelated coverbal gestures, leading to enhanced
memory performance.
Enriching the study phase with action information, to pro-
mote verbal learning, has been used effectively in foreign
language learning, a field where verbal memory has a crucial
role (Taleghani-Nikazm, 2008). Several researchers have
pointed out how gestures increase recall and prevent decay
when used to accompany foreign language words (Kelly,
McDevitt, & Esch, 2009; Macedonia, 2003; Tellier, 2008).
Interestingly, abstract words also profit from the use of enact-
ment, as demonstrated by Macedonia and Knösche (2011).
The reason why enacted items are better remembered and
retained is still under debate. Different explanations have
been proposed for the enactment effect. As they are not
mutually exclusive, we can say they mirror different per-
spectives. Some authors (see Allen, 1995) refer to classical
cognitive theories, such as the depth of processing principle
(Craik & Tulving, 1975). According to this principle, the
deeper the item is processed (i.e., in terms of semantic fea-
tures), the more likely it will be recalled in the future; more-
over, the memory trace will also last longer. Hence, item
recall should benefit from enactment in the encoding phase
as it deepens the level of processing. The dual code theory by
Paivio (Paivio, 1971) is also referred to as a mechanism
underlining this effect (Tellier, 2008): Those items that com-
prise not only verbal but also visual information are more
efficiently remembered. Gestures, in this case, provide the
second "code," the motor trace that plays the same role as the
visual code.
The hypothesis of the motor trace is also taken into account
by Macedonia et al. (Macedonia, Muller, & Friederici, 2011)
to explain learning of both concrete and abstract words during
foreign language acquisition. According to the authors,
performing a gesture when learning a word . . . strengthens the
connections to embodied features of the word that are contained
in its semantic core representation. . . . in the case of abstract
words such as adverbs, gesture constructs an arbitrary motor
image from scratch that grounds abstract meaning in the
learner's body. (Macedonia & von Kriegstein, 2012, p. 398)
All of these positions are based on the idea that an enrich-
ment of the semantic representation facilitates the advantage
of enactment.
However, other researchers explored the effect of action
on language processing, while assuming the concept of sim-
ulation as a theoretical background. According to Barsalou
(Barsalou, 2008), "simulation is the re-enactment of percep-
tual, motor, and introspective states acquired during
experience with the world, body, and mind" (p. 618). The
effects of motor simulation have been widely investigated in
several behavioral experiments, addressing different issues
about the interplay between language and action in different
linguistic processes (Bergen & Wheeler, 2010; Ditman,
Brunye, Mahoney, & Taylor, 2010; Frak, Nazir, Goyette,
Cohen, & Jeannerod, 2010; Papeo, Corradi-Dell'Acqua, &
Rumiati, 2011; Rueschemeyer, Lindemann, van Rooij, van
Dam, & Bekkering, 2010; Springer & Prinz, 2010; Taylor &
Zwaan, 2008; Tseng & Bergen, 2005; Zwaan & Taylor,
2006). Yet, the direction of the effect of simulation is still
unclear: Does it help or interfere with the linguistic process?
The literature reports opposing results related to comprehen-
sion and lexical decision tasks. Some authors (Myung,
Blumstein, & Sedivy, 2006; Rueschemeyer et al., 2010)
found a facilitation effect (faster reaction times [RTs]) due to
a match between the action performed and the one described
by the verb. Other authors (Buccino et al., 2005) observed an
interference when the effector used to provide the answer
and the one involved in the action word were the same.
It is quite interesting that, to our knowledge, few articles
aimed at applying the concept of simulation to the learning
processes, investigating the role of overt action execution
duringlearning.Paulusandcollaborators(Paulus,Lindemann,
& Bekkering, 2009), for example, predicted that if the acqui-
sition of functional information about an object requires a
mental simulation of its use, then an overt motor interference
during the encoding phase should affect the acquisition of the
functional object knowledge by blocking motor simulation.
To test this hypothesis, Paulus and collaborators (Paulus
et al., 2009) constructed two sets of novel objects: Half of
these objects related to the action of hearing, and the other
half related to the action of smelling (both actions being per-
formedbymanipulatingtheobjectwithonehand).Participants
were shown pictures of the objects and instructed to learn ver-
bally their functional properties by repeating them aloud. The
learning settings were systematically varied according to four
different interference conditions during the encoding phase:
no interference, hand interference (participants had to squeeze
a soft ball while performing the verbal learning task), foot
interference (participants had to press a soft ball with their
feet while performing the verbal learning task), and attention
interference (the task concomitant to the learning one was an
auditory oddball target detection task). As predicted, the per-
formance--assessed in a subsequent test phase--decreased
significantly in the hand interference condition. In this condi-
tion, the actual movement performed during the learning
phase interfered with spontaneous and covert motor simula-
tion of the functional object knowledge. The fact that action
information contributes to conceptual processing was already
identified by Kiefer et al. (Kiefer, Sim, Liebich, Hauk, &
Tanaka, 2007), who found that, during a categorization task
of previously learned novel objects, an early activation of the
frontal motor regions and later activation of occipitoparietal
visuomotor regions occurred only when a pantomime of the
Repetto et al. 3
features of the objects was performed during learning phase.
However, these experiments deal with the learning processes
linked to conceptual (i.e., functional) information and not
with language learning per se, as addressed in the research
previously described, which used gestures enrichment.
Starting from this theoretical background, the aim of the
present work is to investigate the role of motor simulation
(related to the match-mismatch between the effector that
executes the action and that described by the action verb)
during the acquisition of a foreign language. To reach this
goal, an experimental setting was implemented in which par-
ticipants had to learn foreign verbs--action (hand or foot
actions) and abstract--with or without concomitant real and
virtual motor tasks. The tasks had to be performed using vir-
tual reality technology.
Virtual reality is a combination of technological devices
that allows users to create, explore, and interact with 3-D
environments. Typically, individuals entering a virtual envi-
ronment feel part of this world, and they have the opportu-
nity to interact with it almost as they would in the real world.
The similarity of the virtual experience to the real world
relies mostly on three features: sight, hearing, and interac-
tion. In most cases, the visual input is provided by means of
a computer monitor or a head-mounted display (HMD). The
HMD is a visualization helmet that conveys computer-
generated images to both eyes, giving the illusion of the third
dimension in the surrounding space. Aural devices may be
head-based, such as headphones, or stand-alone, such as
speakers. The degree of interaction relies on multiple factors.
Probably the most influential of these is the software that
manages this virtual interaction: The more users see their
actions affecting the virtual world, the more they will feel
immersed and engaged. These features of the virtual experi-
ence have an impact on the sense of presence perceived by
the user. Presence is usually defined as the "sense of being
there" in a scene depicted by a medium (Barfield, Zelter,
Sheridan, & Slater, 1995). In other words, the more a virtual
environment is able to elicit a "perceptual illusion of non-
mediation" in the user (Lombard & Ditton, 1997), the more
the user will feel present in the environment. The determi-
nants of presence are multiple, and refer, on one side, to the
features of the environment and to the level of interaction it
allows (IJsselsteijn, de Ridder, Freeman,Avons, & Bouwhuis,
2001; IJsselsteijn & Riva, 2003) and, on the other side, to the
user's characteristics (i.e., the tendency to use visual repre-
sentations; Slater & Usoh, 1994).
In our experiment, the evaluation of the sense of presence
was a critical issue: It has been proven that some key aspects
linked to presence, such as the sense of spatial presence, cor-
relate with the activation of different cortical regions, includ-
ing motor and premotor areas (Baumgartner, Valko, Esslen,
& Jancke, 2006). Hence, understanding the role of these
areas during semantic comprehension of action words
(Repetto et al., 2013) is also a fundamental prerequisite to
understanding how presence modulates linguistic processes.
Our main hypothesis is that if the simulation of the action
described by the verb is important for learning a verb's
meaning, then a concomitant action that involves the same
effector of the verb should modulate its recall.
More specifically, we hypothesized three scenarios:
Hypothesis 1: Motor simulation is not involved: If so, the
acquisition of action verbs will be equal, regardless of the
effector described.
Hypothesis 2: Motor simulation is involved and triggered
by actual motion: If so, as participants use their hands to
explore the virtual environment, the memorization of
hand-action verbs should be modulated.
Hypothesis 3: Motor simulation is involved and triggered
by virtual motion: If so, as participants virtually walk/run
in the environment, the memorization of the foot-action
verbs should be modulated.
Method
Participants
Forty-two volunteers (16 males and 26 females, age: range =
19-49 years, M = 33.17, SD = 7.23; years of education: range
= 13-21, M = 16.27, SD = 2.33), were recruited for the experi-
ment by public advertisement. Participants were all native
Italian speakers and had normal or corrected-to-normal
vision. Exclusion criteria included history of traumatic brain
injury or neurological diseases. No participant was aware of
the specific purpose of the study. They were informed that
one of the participants, chosen based on the best performance,
would receive a coupon worth 50 euros. All participants
signed an informed consent (previously approved by the eth-
ics committee of the university) to join the experiment.
Stimuli
Fifteen verbs in the Czech language were selected: Five of
them described actions performed with the hand (e.g., to
draw), five verbs described actions performed with the foot/
leg (e.g., to jump), and five of the verbs were intellectual or
symbolic activities (e.g., to forget). The complete set of items
is listed in Table 1.
We choose the Czech language because, on one hand, it is
almost unknown in Italy (thus optimum to avoid familiarity
effects), and, on the other hand, its phonology is quite com-
prehensible for Italian speakers. The three categories of
verbs included items matched for length and frequency,
according to the available database for spoken Italian (De
Mauro, Mancini, Vedovelli, & Voghera, 1993). All the Czech
verbs were audiotaped with an online voice synthesizer, and
the correspondent Italian translations were recorded by a
female human voice.
Each trial was composed of a Czech verb, followed by its
Italian translation, and by the repetition of the same Czech
4 SAGE Open
verb, with 1 s of delay in between. The intertrial delay was
set up at 3 s. Figure 1 summarizes the trial composition and
timing.
Five blocks were constructed and randomly presented. A
particular trial was presented only once in each block, and
the order of presentation of the trials was randomized. Thus,
in total, the task included 75 trials.
Virtual Environment
The virtual environment employed the freeware software
NeuroVr2 (www.neurovr2.org). It was designed to represent
a park on a sunny day. When entering the virtual park, the
participant started his or her exploration from a paved track,
and the "first-person point of view" was set up as for an adult
who was standing and ready to explore the park. On the sides
of the track, green grass completely covered the ground, and
trees and shrubs enriched the area. In addition to natural fea-
tures, many artifacts were shown that typically would be
seen in a park: for example, benches, streetlamps, and bins.
A picnic area and a playground were displayed. No human
beings were present in the scene. The interaction with the
environment (when required, depending on the experimental
condition) was regulated by manipulating the left knob of a
joypad (Xbox 360) with the left thumb. The virtual environ-
ment was projected through an HMD, shaped as sunglasses
(covering the eyes and resting on the ears).
Questionnaires
To measure the sense of presence, the ITC-Sense of Presence
Inventory (ITC-SOPI) was employed (Lessiter, Freeman,
Keogh, & Davidoff, 2001). This questionnaire was devel-
oped taking into account the key factors that predict the sense
of presence; it focuses on the user's experience of the media,
both during and after the experience. It is based on four fac-
tors: Sense of Physical Space (Cronbach's alpha = .94),
Engagement (Cronbach's alpha = .89), Ecological Validity
(Cronbach's alpha = .76), and Negative Effects (Cronbach's
alpha = .77).
Participants also completed the UsoImm77 questionnaire
(Antonietti & Colombo, 1997). This questionnaire aims at
investigating the spontaneous occurrence of visualization
and mental images in everyday life activities. The question-
naire comprises 77 items: Each item typifies a situation in
which people may experience mental images. Subjects are
requested to rate, on a 5-point scale, how frequently the visu-
alization process described in the item occurs for them. The
items concern different mental functions (memorizing,
recalling, problem solving, daydreaming), involve different
kinds of mental images (static and dynamic, single and inter-
active, personal and impersonal, spontaneously elicited by
external stimuli and intentionally constructed and processed

places), and concern different situations (e.g., study activi-
ties, leisure time, and so on).
Procedure
Before attending the experimental session, volunteers were
contacted by email and requested to complete (using an
online form) the Usoimm77 questionnaire. This had to be
finished at least 1 day before the experimental session to pre-
vent a priming effect on spontaneous imagery.
On the day of the experimental session, participants were
welcomed into a quiet room by an experienced researcher.
The materials used in the lab included a personal computer
and the tools used to experience virtual reality (VR; joypad
and HMD). These materials were arranged in front of the
participant at a distance of approximately 50 cm.
As a first step, the participants wore the HMD and held
the joypad, while the researcher launched the practice ses-
sion. This first phase aimed at familiarizing participants with
the environment and the commands needed to interact with
it. Afterwards, the experimental session started. The main
task was the verbal learning of the verbs, which were pre-
sented in an auditory manner. Participants were instructed to
listen to the Czech verbs, trying to remember as many items
as possible. In addition, participants had to follow different
instructions according to the experimental condition to which
they belonged (as explained below).
Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experi-
mental conditions: the Run condition or the Baseline condi-
tion. In the Run condition, participants performed the main
task while exploring the park as if they were walking or run-
ning through it. The instructions stressed that they had to
keep walking, in whatever direction they were going, with-
out stopping until the verbs presentation stopped. The walk-
like action inside the park was achieved by moving the
joypad knob on the left with the left hand. This experimental
condition required people to stand in front of the computer to
assume a body position coherent with the virtual walk. No
real walking movements were allowed during the session.
In the Baseline condition, the participants sat in front of
the computer and started the virtual experience as if they were
seated on a bench. In front of them, the playground of the
park was displayed. Participants were instructed to pay atten-
tion to the Czech verbs: No action within the environment
was allowed, with the only exception being the visual explo-
ration of the scene (by turning the head around). This condi-
tion served as a baseline measure of the verbal learning.
After completing the study phase (which lasted about 12
min), participants were asked to perform a cued recall task:
The experimenter presented the Czech verbs, in an auditory
manner and one at a time, and the participants had to provide
orally the corresponding Italian translation. The number of
verbs correctly remembered was recorded. Immediately after
the cued recall task, a recognition task was performed.
Participants were instructed to listen to the Czech verbs and to
select, as quickly as possible, one of the two possible transla-
tions written on the left and right side of the screen by press-
ing the corresponding left or right button on a button box. The
correct responses were presented equally on the left or on the
right side of the screen. The correct translation was always
coupled with an incorrect, but plausible, translation (i.e., the
translation of another presented verb). The RTs were recorded.
At the end of the memory tasks, the participants completed
the ITC-SOPI questionnaire (Lessiter et al., 2001).
Results
Statistical analyses were conducted on 40 participants. Two
of them presented either ceiling or floor effects in the cued
recall tasks and, hence, were excluded as outliers.
First of all, we were interested in testing the impact of the
different virtual experiences on the dependent variables
(number of verbs correctly remembered in the cued recall
task, RTs of verbs correctly recognized, and number of errors
in the recognition task--see descriptive statistics in Table 2).
We performed Repeated Measures ANOVAS. We used
the variable "Verb" (three levels: hand­foot­abstract), as a
within subjects variable and the "Condition" as a between
subjects variable with two levels (baseline­run). Results
highlighted that for the number of items recalled, there was
an effect of the type of Verb, F(2, 78) = 27.261, mean square
error (MSE) = 0.91, p < .001, 2 = 0.41, but not of the
Condition, F(1, 39) = 0.618, MSE = 3.94, p = .436. Contrasts
computed on the variable Verb demonstrated that there were
fewer abstract verbs correctly remembered than hand- or
foot-action verbs, F(1, 39) = 66.751, MSE = 1.09, p < .001,
2 = 0.631, but hand-action verbs and foot-action verbs did
not differ, F(1, 39) = 0.952, MSE = 2.18, p = .335.
Furthermore, the effect of the type of Verb did not change
depending on the Condition, Verb × Condition: F(2, 78) =
0.703, MSE = .91, p = .498.
With respect to the recognition task, the number of errors
was not influenced by the type of Verb, F(2, 78) = 2.035, MSE
= 2.86; p = .14, nor by the Condition, F(1, 39) = 1.95, MSE =
6.61, p = .17, nor by the interaction between the two, F(2, 78)
= .79, MSE = 2.86, p = .46. Consistent with the pattern found
for the free recall measure, RTs were influenced by the Verb,
F(2, 78) = 6.52, MSE = 69914.48, p < .05, 2 = 0.14, but not
by the Condition, F(1, 39) = 2.79, MSE = 421827.48, p = .1,
nor by the interaction Verb × Condition, F(2, 78) = 0.17, MSE
= 69914.48, p = .71. Contrasts showed that RTs for abstract
verbs were lower than for the other type of verbs, F(1, 39) =
15.061, p < .001, MSE = 85918.97, 2 = 0.28, that were simi-
lar to each other, F(1, 39) = 0.59, MSE = 165099.31, p = .449.
Afterward, the scores of the questionnaires were taken into
account. First, we computed a MANCOVAusing the responses
(numbers of errors, response time, and free recall performance)
as dependent variables, the Condition (baseline vs. run) as a
fixed factor, and the subscales of ITC-SOPI questionnaire as
6 SAGE Open
covariates. We used the subscales as covariates as we were
interested in examining if and how the levels of perceived pres-
ence could mediate participants'overall responses.
The general model was significant for number of errors in
recognizing the correct translation of hand-related verbs,
F(5, 35) = 6.72, p < .001, MSE = 2.60, 2 = 0.49, R2 = .49:
Participants in the Baseline condition committed fewer
errors (M = 2.10, SD = 1.59) than those in the Run condition
(M = 3.29, SD = 2.41). As covariates, the subscale
Engagement, F(5, 35) = 6.37, MSE = 2.60, p < .05, 2 = 0.15,
and Negative Effects, F(5, 35) = 17.15, MSE = 2.60, p < .05,
2 = 0.33, appear to have contributed to this difference. Data
highlighted how the Engagement subscale had a negative
relationship with this dependent variable (B = -1.68, t =
-2.52,p<.05),andhence,thehigherthelevelofEngagement,
the lower the mistake rate. The opposite was true for the
Negative Effects subscale: Higher scores in this subscale
were positively related to higher number of errors (B = 1.46,
t = 4.14, p < .001).
When examining the influence of specific covariates on
our independent variable, it was possible to highlight another
interesting effect. The subscale Eco-Valid had a significant
influence, F(5, 35) = 5.17, MSE = 3.42, p < .05, 2 = 0.13, on
the number of errors in translating foot-related verbs. This
subscale had a negative relationship with the dependent vari-
able (B = -1.10, t = -2.27, p < .05). This means that lower
error rates in recognizing the correct translation of foot-
related verbs were associated to higher scores in the
Ecological Validity scale. Interestingly, mean estimates pre-
dicted by the effect of this subscale (Baseline = 2.091, Run =
1.866) are in the opposite direction with respect to the
observed sample means (Baseline = 1.8, Run = 2.14; see
Figure 2).
As a second step, the same analysis was applied to the
UsoImm 77 questionnaire, but results revealed no significant
effects for any variable, thus indicating that the individual
tendency to use imagery did not influence the task.
Discussion
The present study aimed at investigating the role of motor
simulation during foreign language learning. To achieve this
goal, we used a virtual environment where participants, while
learning Czech verbs, had to move as if they were running.

They achieved this virtual run experience by manipulating a
knob with their left hand. This procedure allowed participants
to obtain two kinds of action: one real (the movement of the
hand on the knob) and one virtual (the virtual movement of
the feet, which is necessary to run). When comparing the lin-
guistic performance (in terms of learning) in this condition
with that in the baseline condition (i.e., without any real or
virtual action), we were able to understand if simulation is
involved in this process and which movement triggers it.
When looking at the experiment's results, it appears that,
overall, the simulation of an action performed with the same/
different effector does not play a role during second language
learning. In fact, the number of items correctly recalled did
not vary across conditions but depended only upon the type
of verb: Abstract verbs were more difficult to remember than
concrete ones. This finding is not surprising as the cognitive
advantage of concrete words over abstract words has been
recognized in several memory and language tasks (Nelson &
Schreiber, 1992; Paivio, Walsh, & Bons, 1994).
Yet the fact that hand-action verbs and foot-action verbs
did not differ from each other and, moreover, that the effect
of the verb type was not different (depending on the condi-
tions) seem to indicate that neither of the actions (real or
virtual) affected the learning of verbs that described actions
performed with the same or different effector. Coherently,
during the recognition task, the same pattern of effects was
evident: The words that were previously better retained
(hand- and foot-action verbs) were more quickly recog-
nized, and the opposite was true for the words that were less
remembered (abstract verbs). On the contrary, the number of
errors in the recognition task did not appear to be influenced
by any considered variable: One possible explanation is that
the error rate did not rely on the learning process but on dif-
ferent variables, possibly linked to the specific setting or
environment.
The fact that simulation is apparently not involved in ver-
bal learning is a new and relevant finding. Data in the litera-
ture report an advantage in terms of language learning due to
linking words or sentences with gestures (Kelly et al., 2009;
Macedonia & von Kriegstein, 2012; Tellier, 2008). However,
the enrichment of the action achieved by using gestures and
by using the typical paradigm employed to test simulation
differ substantially. In one case, the learner pairs a lexical
item with a univocal pattern of movements, and the couple
action + word is repeated over and over during the study
phase. In the second case, a specific movement (virtual or
real--in this study, respectively, the run and the manipula-
tion of the knob) is performed for the duration of the study
phase with one specific effector that either matches or does
not match the one corresponding to the verb. Thus, there is
not a specific combination between motion and semantics,
but only a generic sharing versus not sharing of the effector
(Buccino et al., 2005; Repetto, Cipresso, & Riva, 2015).
Moreover, in the present study, volunteers underwent a sin-
gle session of learning with a relatively small number of verb
repetitions: This could account for the lack of differential
recall performances regardless of different learning condi-
tions and types of verbs (notice that Macedonia [Macedonia
et al., 2011] found that training does not always have an
impact on retention). However, it is easy to see that while the
gesture paradigm promotes the grounding of the meaning in
the learner's body experience, the use of the same versus dif-
ferent effector is not enough to establish a link between the
lexical item and the action.
Yet, when learning focuses on conceptual knowledge, the
involvement of simulation is reported in verbal learning
tasks (Paulus et al., 2009). In this study, the learners were
told explicitly to pay attention to the functional use of the
objects, and thus, it is possible that these specific instructions
allowed them to imagine the possible use of that object. In
this case, the imagery is likely activated rather than simula-
tion, and this process relies on different cerebral networks
(Willems, Toni, Hagoort, & Casasanto, 2010).
The fact that no effect of simulation in the foreign-
language-learning paradigm emerged from our data, com-
pared with its well-established involvement in other linguistic
tasks such as comprehension (Ditman et al., 2010; Frak et al.,
2010; Tseng & Bergen, 2005; Zwaan & Taylor, 2006), seems
to posit that simulation is a relatively "automatic" mecha-
nism, activated during online processes, sometimes guided by
the context or by attentional focus (Bergen & Wheeler, 2010;
Taylor & Zwaan, 2008), but never pervaded by an awareness
of the usage of strategies. Relying on this perspective, foreign
language learning can be seen as a typical process in which
individual strategies have a strong impact. To support this
interpretation, we can mention the fact that, after the experi-
mental session, participants spontaneously told the experi-
menter the tricks they used to recall as many verbs as possible
in the final test (Lawson & Hogben, 1996). For this reason,
the absence of a simulation effect in a language-learning task

does not rule out the involvement of the motor system in this
linguistic process.
The second (and somehow surprising) result is the effect
of simulation in the recognition task. As discussed previ-
ously, the recognition measures do not seem to be influenced
by the condition of learning (with or without virtual/real
movement), but, more interestingly, some effect arises from
the contribution of the presence components, as assessed by
the ITC-Sopi questionnaire. Specifically, the number of
hand-action verb errors in the recognition task seems to be
predicted globally by the set of subscales of the question-
naire, with Engagement and Negative effects being the most
important predictors. The hand-action verbs are more easily
recognized if acquired without interference movement
(Baseline condition), when the learner experienced a high
level of Engagement and a low level of Negative Effects.
Even more interesting is the effect on the number of errors
for foot-action verbs: This measure appeared to be influ-
enced specifically by Ecological Validity, that is, the ten-
dency to recognize the environment as real. When this index
was higher, the errors decreased; moreover, the impact of
Ecological Validity, when controlling for the other subscales,
was predicted to foster fewer errors in the Run condition than
in the Baseline condition. This effect is compatible with the
following simulation: In the Run condition, learners per-
formed a virtual motion with their feet, and this action was
simulated exactly at the same time as the lexical access.
Thus, the more the learner perceived the environment as real,
the more the virtual action was effective on the cognitive rep-
resentation of the verb, and the more he or she simulated the
action during the recognition. The foot-action simulation, in
turn, facilitated the lexical access to the verbs that shared the
same effector.
Conclusion
The aim of the experiment was to extend the knowledge
about the mechanism of simulation and its cognitive effects.
In particular, we were interested in testing the occurrence of
this process during linguistic tasks in which, to our knowl-
edge, simulation has never been applied to second language
learning. The first important finding is that the simulation per
se is not sufficient to establish a relationship between words
and action during learning, resulting in null effect with
respect to the number of items recalled (at least with low
number of items and repetitions).
Nevertheless, and maybe more interestingly, our para-
digm allowed us to identify a new and relevant finding: The
simulation can be mediated by other perceptual and cogni-
tive processes induced by the context, especially the sense of
presence. In this perspective, the use of virtual reality gave
us the opportunity to point out the role of some factors linked
to the specific experience. These factors appear to be related
to the concept of presence (which is linked to the specific
characteristic of a VR experience) and can promote or
interfere with the simulation process that occurs, even after
the virtual experience, as evidenced during the recognition
task. In fact, it is known that the sense of presence is medi-
ated by the egocentric perspective in the environment (Bae
et al., 2012), typical of the virtual experience.
This result can suggest two reflections: On one hand, it
makes clear that simulation can happen when the lexical item
must be accessed after being learned. On the other hand, it
pinpoints that the occurrence of simulation during this pro-
cess is mediated in different ways by the different compo-
nents of presence involved in the simulation. The latter
observation raises interesting questions to be addressed by
future research: Is it possible to modify the virtual environ-
ment to fit the parameters that promote simulation (accord-
ing to the present findings: the reduction of the Negative
Effects, the enhancement of Ecological Validity and
Engagement)? What happens when the environment is "opti-
mized" in terms of presence? Could the simulation speed up
the time to access the word as well (in the present study, RTs
do not appear to be influenced)?
In the present study, the virtual environment had a very
basic structure, and the virtual experience allowed a low
level of interaction. We can hypothesize that implementing a
virtual world that induces higher levels of presence could be
a first step toward this goal.
