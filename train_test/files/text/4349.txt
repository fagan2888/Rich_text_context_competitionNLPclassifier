Abstract
Objective: This analysis critically compares publications discussing complications and functional
outcomes of plate fixation (PF) versus intramedullary fixation (IF) for midshaft clavicle fractures.
Methods: Relevant studies published between January 1990 and October 2014, without language
restrictions, were identified in database searches of PubMedÕ, MedlineÕ, Embase and the Chinese
National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Studies that compared postoperative complications
and functional outcomes between PF and IF for midshaft clavicle fractures, and provided sufficient
data for analysis, were included in this meta-analysis.
Results: After strict evaluation, 12 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Studies
encompassed 462 participants in the PF group and 440 in the IF group. Study participants were
followed up for !1 year. Outcomes were superior with IF compared with PF in terms of shoulder
constant score at 6-month follow-up, fewer symptomatic hardware complications, lower rate of
refracture after hardware removal and less hypertrophic scarring. In other aspects, such as
functional recovery at 12-months and 24-months, Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
questionnaire results at 12-month follow-up, shoulder motion range, rates of superficial infection,
temporary brachial plexus lesion, nonunion, malunion, delayed union, implant failure and need for
major revision, both techniques were similar.

Conclusions: Findings of this meta-analysis suggest that, in many respects, IF was superior to PF
for the management of midshaft clavicle fractures. This finding could aid surgeons in making
decisions on the optimum internal fixation pattern for midshaft clavicular fractures.

Introduction
Clavicular fracture is a common injury,
accounting for 2.6­10% of all fractures in
adults.1­4 Approximately 80% of clavicular
fractures involve the midshaft of the clavicle
and >70% of midshaft clavicular fractures
are displaced.4,5 Conservative treatment has
been traditionally considered as `standard
treatment' for midshaft fractures even for
displaced fractures, with the expectation that
even severe radiographic malalignment
would not influence functional results.
However, a relatively high incidence (30%)
of postoperative complications and deficits in
functional recovery of the shoulder has been
reported in patients originally treated with
conservative regimens.6­8 With advance-
ments in techniques and implants for fracture
fixing, internal fixation is generally con-
sidered a better choice for these fractures
than conservative treatment. Substantial con-
troversy among surgeons regarding the opti-
mal fixation pattern (plate fixation [PF] or
intramedullary fixation [IF]) of these injuries
exists and further research on better treat-
ment options is needed.
To date, multiple forms of plating and
intramedullary devices have been used to fix
midshaft clavicle fractures, including pre-
contoured dynamic compression plates
(DCP), use of a reconstruction plate for
PF and Knowles pinning, elastic stable
intramedullary nailing with a Rockwood
clavicle pin and an Acumed clavicle rod for
IF9­12. PF is a popular technique providing
a rigid fix, allowing early rehabilitation
protocols.13 A precontoured plate, designed
to parallel the S-shaped curve of the clavicle,
has become a popular PF pattern. However,
extensive soft-tissue dissection, implant
prominence, postoperative infection, scar-
ring, hardware failure and refracture after
the removal of the plate are all negative
factors for PF.14­17 With IF, the soft tissue
envelope, periosteum and vascular integrity
can be preserved,18,19 early hardware migra-
tion appears to be solved by an improved
locked intramedullary device, but the issue
of low biomechanical stability remains.20
Barlow et al.21 and Houwert et al.22 have
conducted relevant systematic reviews com-
paring IF and PF methods of midshaft
clavicle fracture repair, but with qualitative
and equivocal conclusions. Duan et al.23
conducted a meta-analysis of randomized
control trials (RCT), but only two studies
were included comparing complications and
functional outcomes between methods.
Several original studies comparing different
methods have since been published,15,24­28
which prompted this updated meta-analysis.
Accordingly, the present analysis aimed to
evaluate whether IF is better than PF in
terms of postoperative complications and
functional outcomes for the management of
acute midshaft clavicle fractures.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
This meta-analysis was conducted in accord-
ance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
202 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
(PRISMA) guidelines (http://www.prisma-
statement.org/statement.htm). An electronic
literature search was performed in PubMedÕ,
MedlineÕ, Embase and the Chinese National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), to identify
relevant studies published between January
1990 and October 2014. The following key-
words were used: `clavicular' or `clavicle' and
`midshaft' and `fracture' and `intramedullary'
and `plate' or `plating' and `complications'
or `effectiveness' or `results' or `outcome'. A
manual search of references in the included
original articles or systematic reviews was also
performed, to identify any potential add-
itional studies.
Inclusion criteria
Two reviewers (H.G., T. Z.) independently
evaluated the titles and abstracts of the
identified papers. Only full text articles with-
out language restriction were included in this
meta-analysis. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion; if they remained unre-
solved, a third reviewer was consulted.
Inclusion criteria were RCTs or case­control
or cohort studies comparing the outcomes of
two methods for treating midshaft clavicular
fractures, at least one set of results in each
paper had to be original, the age of partici-
pants in both groups had to be <65 years
(young, active participants), participants in
studies were followed up for !12 months and
sufficient data were provided to estimate the
odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean dif-
ference (SMD) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
Quality assessment and data extraction
The quality of studies was evaluated by
the tool recommended in the Cochrane
Handbook 5.1.0: `The Cochrane collabor-
ation's tool for assessing risk of bias', which
was used by Fang et al.29 This scale includes
six major potential sources of bias, including
sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding, incomplete data, selective outcome
reporting and other outcomes reporting.
Data were carefully and independently
abstracted from eligible studies by the same
two reviewers (H.G., T.Z.). The following
basic characteristics were abstracted from
each study: first author's name; publication
year; patients' age and sex; follow-up dur-
ation; definition and numbers in each IF and
PF group; the number of studies providing
information for each surgical method.
Statistical analyses
Odds ratios and 95% CI were estimated
and pooled across studies to assess for
any differences between the two methods.
A P-value < 0.05 was considered significant.
Heterogeneity among studies was tested by
Q-statistics, with significance set at P < 0.1030
and further measured by I2 statistics, with
I2 > 50% indicating significant inconsistency.
A random-effects model was used to calculate
pooled ORs in the case of significant hetero-
geneity (P < 0.10 or I2 > 50%); otherwise,
a fixed-effects model was used.31 The out-
come of the meta-analysis for variables was
summarized graphically using forest plots.
Publication bias was assessed and presented
using funnel plots. For any variable present-
ing with large heterogeneity, a sensitivity
analysis, excluding outlier studies, was con-
ducted to investigate the source of hetero-
geneity. All analyses were performed using
StataÕ software, version 11.0 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Basic information
The initial database search yielded 985
papers: 673 were excluded as they were in
an inappropriate format (e.g. abstracts, let-
ters, meeting reports, same data reported at
different time-points); 193 were excluded for
not meeting the specific therapeutic methods
according to the study criteria; 76 were
Xiao et al. 203
excluded as the reported results were outside
the interest of this study; 29 were excluded as
they did not provide sufficient data for the
meta-analysis; one study was excluded as its
follow-up period was too short (mean of 5.9
months);32 one study was excluded as its
participants were not within the specified
age criteria.33 The remaining 12 studies were
eligible and were included in this meta-
analysis. The search procedure is presented
in Figure 1.
The 12 original articles included were
published between 1999 and 2014. A total of
440 patients from these 12 studies had
undergone IF; 462 had undergone PF. In
each study, patients treated by each method
were similar in terms of sex, side involved
and injury mechanism. In two studies,
patients treated with PF were significantly
older than those treated with IF,28,34
whereas in the other included studies, the
age between the two groups was similar.

A summary of basic characteristics is listed
in Table 1.
A detailed quality assessment of the
included studies is presented in Table 2.
Postoperative complications
Total complications were reported in four
studies involving 146 IF patients and 115 PF
patients. The PF group yielded a slightly
higher incidence of total complications than
the IF group (13.9% versus 7.5%), but the
combined result did not reach significance
(OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.24, 1.20; Figure 2).
Postoperative superficial infection was
reported in ten studies encompassing 409
IF patients and 430 PF patients; overall, 14
(3.4%) and 19 (4.4%) patients, respectively,
were infected shortly after surgery. Analysis
for a combined outcome found no signifi-
cant difference between surgical methods
(OR 0.82; 95% CI 0.43, 1.57; Figure 3A),
with little heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 8.5%). Begg's
test showed no publication bias for this
variable (Figure 3B).
Six studies involving 251 IF patients and
254 PF patients reported postoperative
symptomatic hardware, which was higher
in the PF group (22.4%) than in the IF
group (6.0%). This result was significant,
without heterogeneity (OR 0.18; 95% CI
0.10, 0.33; Figure 4).
Five studies reported refracture incidence
after implant removal, and found a lower
incidence in IF patients compared with
PF patients (0% versus 6.3%); the meta-
analysis result was not significant (OR 0.17;
95% CI 0.04, 0.67; Figure 5).
Development of hypertrophic scarring is
an important complication that affects
patients' confidence in their appearance.
Three studies reported postoperative
hypertrophic scarring, with a higher inci-
dence in PF patients (13.6%) than in IF

patients (2.9%). The meta-analysis for com-
bined results suggested a significant differ-
ence (OR 0.26; 95% CI 0.09, 0.99), with
partial heterogeneity (I2 ¼ 39.7%; Figure 6).
Nonunion is an important complication of
this fracture, as it commonly necessitates
a second operation for bone grafting and
implant fixation. Six studies reported the
incidence of nonunion, with slightly higher
reports in PF patients than in IF patients
(5.1% versus 4.7%). The meta-analysis result
was not significant (OR 0.96; 95% CI 0.46,
2.00) without any heterogeneity (Figure 7).
There were no significant differences in
temporary brachial plexus lesion, nonunion,
malunion, implant failure and the need for
major revision between the fixation tech-
niques. For these variables, there was no
statistically significant heterogeneity when
investigated using both Q- and I2 statistics
(Table 3).
Functional outcome and motion range
Liu et al.35 and Ko et al.36 reported shoulder
motion in their studies, including forward
flexion, abduction, external rotation and
internal rotation. There were no significant
differences for these items between PF and
IF in the current study, and heterogeneity
was not observed for any item (Table 3).
The shoulder constant score37 is used to
assess the extent of functional recovery, with
higher scores representing better rehabilita-
tion. Constant scores at 6 months were
reported by three studies, at 12 months by
three studies and at 24-months follow-up by
two studies. At 6-month follow-up, patients
from the IF group had a higher constant
score (92.6 versus 87.2) than those in the PF
group: this finding was not significant by
meta-analysis (SMD 0.94; 95% CI 0.31,
1.56) but there was significant heterogeneity
(Figure 8). However, at the 12- and 24-
month follow-up appointments, the results
between groups were not significantly dif-
ferent (Table 3).
The Disability of Arm, Shoulder and
Hand (DASH) questionnaire37 is a standar-
dized 30-item measure evaluating patients'
subjective perception of their upper extrem-
ity health status, including impairments
and activity limitations. Response options
range between 1 and 5, based on the ability
to perform activities (1, no difficulty; 2,
mild difficulty; 3, moderate difficulty; 4,
severe difficulty; 5, unable); the score
ranges between 0 and 100, with 0 indicating
no disability and 100 indicating complete
disability. In this study, DASH score at
the 6-month follow-up was reported in one
study,15 where IF patients scored better than

PF patients, with a significantly lower score
(6.6 versus 15.0). The authors also reported
the outcome of DASH at the 24-month
follow-up, when no significant difference
was observed. A further two studies35,36
reported that at the 12-month follow-up,
the DASH score between IF and PF was not
statistically different (SMD 0.17; 95% CI
À0.16, 0.31); the meta-analysis showed no
heterogeneity (Figure 9).
Descriptive analysis
Union time was reported to be shorter with
IF than with PF, but it was not possible to
perform a meta-analysis on this variable due
to significant heterogeneity and the different
forms that the data were presented in the
original studies. The American Shoulder
and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scale37 is a
common tool to assess shoulder function
recovery. Narsaria et al.24 reported that the
ASES score at the 24-month postoperative
follow-up was slightly higher in PF patients
than in IF patients (99.4 versus 96.8), but
this finding was not significantly different.
Discussion
Midshaft clavicle fracture has traditionally
been treated conservatively, without sur-
gery, but this method has a high rate of
complications.6,8 Surgery appears to offer a
better alternative for fractures of this type.38
However, there is controversy regarding
whether IF or PF provides the optimum
outcome for patients. In this study, a meta-
analysis of 12 original studies was used to
address this key issue. The results showed
that IF outperformed PF, with a lower rate
of symptomatic hardware, less hypertrophic
scarring, fewer refractures after implant
removal and better functional outcome at
the 6-month follow-up. Other complications
(including overall complications, implant fail-
ure, nonunion, malunion, delayed union, the
need for major revision surgery, temporary
brachial plexus lesion and reduced shoulder
motion) showed no significant difference
between the methods.
Surgeons commonly pay more attention
to patients' complications that might affect
prognosis and functional recovery; severe
complications may cause secondary sur-
gery.18,27,28 A higher total complication
incidence was more likely in the PF group
than in the IF group18,39 (OR 2.97). The
complications of acute midshaft clavicular
fracture in active young patients were due to
surgical procedures and the actual implant
itself, and less associated with the patients'
underlying diseases. In this study, three
implant-related complications: symptomatic
hardware, hypertrophic scarring and refrac-
ture after implant removal were all more
likely to occur in PF rather than IF groups.
As PF generally requires a large incision,
extensive exposure and soft tissue dissection,
this technique is more likely to produce
hypertrophic scarring, compared with IF. In
a study by Kwak-Lee,26 16.4% of patients
sustained symptomatic hardware or incision
complications, which were attributed to
intraoperative traction and/or stretching of
the nerves over the plate. Refracture after
hardware removal was reported to occur only
in patients treated with plates, with an overall
incidence of 6.3% (10/158)24,25,28,34,39 mostly
occurring at the junction of the middle-third
and outer-third regions of the clavicle.
Implant removal after fracture healing
reduces the mechanical strength of the clav-
icle, and the screw holes create weak spots in
this thin bone, which together may initiate
refracture.28,39
Implant failure is an important complica-
tion that affects operative success and causes
over 80% of the revision surgery for midshaft
clavicular fractures.28 In this analysis, the
incidence of implant failure was similar in
both techniques. In PF, implant failure was
mainly triggered by excessive movement and
often manifested as plate bending or loosen-
ing; in IF, lack of stability caused migration of
212 Journal of International Medical Research 44(2)
the intramedullary device.40,41 Therefore, to
prevent this complication, the stability of IF
needs to be improved, and excessive move-
ment, especially in the early stages of recovery
from PF surgery, should be minimized.15,26,42
No significant difference was observed in
shoulder motion range and functional
recovery between IF and PF, except for the
Constant Score at the 6-month follow-up.
This suggests that IF is more likely than PF
to yield a better early functional outcome,
but there is no difference between the tech-
niques at the bone union stage and the late
stage of recovery. In some studies, rapid
union has been confirmed with IF, which
might be important in functional recovery
and shoulder motion.24,26,34,39
The present study suffers from some weak-
nesses. Firstly, only four prospective RCTs
were included in this meta-analysis, which
might lower the power. Secondly, the types of
fixations applied in the studies were varied and
the follow-up periods of each study ranged
widely. Thirdly, the age of patients in each
group was not similar, except for one study.
The choice of treatment was decided by the
demands of each treatment, the surgeons'
experience and the patients underlying med-
ical conditions. Advanced age generally has a
negative effect on the level of function
restored, and this aspect needs further future
study.
Although this study had limitations that
were unavoidable, it still has merit. First, the
search style using both the computer and
manual searching ensures a complete inclu-
sion of relevant studies. Secondly, no sig-
nificant heterogeneity was observed in most
variables, except for active external rotation.
This heterogeneity was diminished by sensi-
tivity analysis, without altering the result.
Lastly, but most importantly, this is the first
quantitative meta-analysis to date to give a
definitive preference to one of the two
methods for treating complex fractures of
the proximal humerus, reflecting the current
status of this issue.
In conclusion, based on present evidence,
IF appears to be superior to PF for the
management of midshaft clavicle fractures.
Compared with PF, IF provides a better
shoulder constant score at 6 months and
fewer incidences of symptomatic hardware,
refracture after hardware removal and
hypertrophic scarring. This could aid sur-
geons in making decisions for fixing mid-
shaft clavicular fractures.
