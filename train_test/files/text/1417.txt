Bone Density and Memory in the Elderly Zhang et al.
Bone Mineral Density and Verbal Memory Impairment
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Yuqing Zhang,1,2 Sudha Seshadri,3 R. Curtis Ellison,2 Timothy Heeren,4 and David T. Felson1
Previous studies have examined the relation of endogenous estrogen levels or estrogen replacement therapy
to the risk of poor cognitive function, but results have been inconclusive. Bone mineral density has been
proposed as a marker for cumulative estrogen exposure. The authors studied the relation of bone mineral
density to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment among 4,304 elderly subjects in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994). Bone mineral density was measured in five regions of
the proximal femur with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Verbal memory was assessed using delayed recall of
a three-item word list and a six-item story. Verbal memory impairment was defined as a combined score of <4.
The prevalence of verbal memory impairment for each increasing bone mineral density quintile at the femoral
neck was 8.35, 5.74, 5.22, 5.00, and 3.38% in women and 11.54, 7.27, 8.47, 6.29, and 5.89% in men,
respectively. With adjustment for age, sex, and other covariates, the prevalence ratios of verbal memory
impairment for each increased bone mineral density quintile were 1.00, 0.64, 0.65, 0.55, and 0.44, respectively
(p for trend < 0.001). These results suggest that bone mineral density in the elderly is associated with verbal
memory impairment. The mechanisms underlying this relation are not understood, but cumulative exposure to
estrogen may play a role. Am J Epidemiol 2001;154:795­802.

Over the past decades, evidence from animal studies indi-
cates that estrogen affects neuronal survival and physiology
in brain areas vital to memory function (1). However, stud-
ies relating estrogen to memory and various other measures
of cognitive performance in human populations have been
equivocal. Some investigators have reported that low levels
of serum endogenous estrogen assessed from a single mea-
surement were associated with an increased risk of poor ver-
bal memory (2, 3), while others have failed to confirm this
(4). Estrogen replacement therapy administered to post-
menopausal women has been associated with improved ver-
bal memory in some studies (5­9) but not in all (10, 11).
If estrogen does improve memory, one would expect that
women with a greater cumulative estrogen exposure during
their lifetime would experience a lower prevalence of mem-
ory impairment. However, because of methodological and
logistic problems, adequate assessment of cumulative estro-
gen exposure has been difficult. Several investigators have
proposed that bone mineral density may serve as a marker of
cumulative estrogen exposure in women (12, 13). We and
other investigators have shown that high bone mass and bone
mineral density are strongly associated with an increased risk
of breast cancer among women (14, 15). Studies have shown
that estradiol, the major circulating form of estrogen, plays an
important role in bone metabolism not only in women but
also in elderly men (16­19). A case-control study conducted
among Japanese women suggested that dementia was associ-
ated with low bone mineral density (20). Recently, Yaffe et al.
(21) reported that high bone mineral density in women was
associated with improved cognitive function; their study eval-
uated a global index of cognition and tests of attention, exec-
utive function, and psychomotor speed rather than focusing
on verbal memory.
Verbal memory impairment is one of the strongest pre-
dictors for the future development of dementia or
Alzheimer's disease (22, 23) and is the single cognitive
index most often related to estrogen deficiency in human
studies (7, 23, 24). To our knowledge, previous studies have
not examined the relation of cumulative estrogen exposure
assessed by bone mineral density to the risk of memory
impairment in either women or men. We used data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) (25) to examine the relation of bone mineral
density to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment
among elderly men and women.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES III was a cross-sectional survey to obtain
nationally representative information on the health and
nutritional status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized, US
population. The survey began in the fall of 1988 and was
completed in the fall of 1994, with oversampling of the
elderly, children under age 5 years, African Americans, and
Mexican Americans. NHANES III consisted of two separate
components, that is, the survey and the medical examina-
tion. The survey was conducted at the participant's home by
interviewers using the Household Adult Questionnaire and
Family Questionnaire, followed shortly thereafter by a stan-
dardized medical examination performed at either the
Mobile Examination Center or the subject's home by physi-
cians and health technicians. A total of 6,596 persons aged
60 years or over completed the Household Adult
Questionnaire, and 5,302 of these persons had a health
examination at the Mobile Examination Center.
Bone mineral density measurement
Bone mineral density measurements were made with
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry among subjects aged 20
years or over. Areal bone mineral density was measured in
five regions in the proximal femur: femoral neck, trochanter,
intertrochanter, Ward's triangle, and total region (25). Bone
mineral density was assessed in 4,818 subjects over 60 years
of age; of these, 4,697 subjects had valid measurements.
Cognitive function assessment
Among subjects 60 years of age or over, cognitive func-
tion was assessed at the home examination and at the
Mobile Examination Center. No specific attempt was made
to exclude the subjects with cognitive impairment from the
memory test. In one section of the Household Adult
Questionnaire, the interviewer recited a list of three items:
"apple," "table," and "penny." Subjects were then asked to
repeat the three items until they had learned all three. About
7.6 percent of the subjects were unable to learn all three
items (i.e., they learned two, one, or none of the items) after
the interviewer repeated these three words three times. After
performing an unrelated task, all subjects (regardless of
whether or not they could repeat the three items immedi-
ately) were asked to recall the three items. This is referred to
as a delayed item recall. One point was awarded for the
recall of each item with a total score ranging from 0 to 3.
During the health examination, subjects were read the fol-
lowing story. "Three children were alone at home and the
house caught on fire. A brave fireman managed to climb in
a back window and carry them to safety. Aside from minor
cuts and bruises, all were well." Subjects were asked to
repeat the story immediately after it was read to them. After
a few minutes of answering unrelated questions, the subjects
were again asked to repeat the story. This was referred to as
a delayed story recall. One point was scored for each of the
following ideas, if present in the answer: three children,
house on fire, fireman climbed in the house, children res-
cued, minor injuries, and everyone was well. Therefore, a
total score for the recall of the story ranged from 0 to 6.
We combined scores from the "delayed item recall" and
the "delayed story recall" to yield a summary score for ver-
bal memory ranging from 0 to 9. In the current analysis, we
adopted the same definition as that proposed by Pekins et al.
(26) to classify verbal memory impairment among the par-
ticipants in NHANES III. In that analysis, a subject was
considered to have verbal memory impairment if his or her
summary score was less than 4 (26).
Other risk factors
Information on other potential risk factors associated with
impairment of verbal memory was also collected. Such fac-
tors included age, gender, racial/ethnic origin, number of
years of education, income, smoking history (never, former,
current), lifetime abstention from alcohol, and history of
stroke. For women, information on hormone replacement
therapy was also collected. Subjects were defined as having
hypertension if their systolic blood pressure was greater
than or equal to 140 mmHg, or if their diastolic blood pres-
sure was greater than or equal to 90 mmHg, or if they
answered positively to the question: "Have you ever been
told by a doctor or other health professional that you have
hypertension, also called high blood pressure?"
Statistical analysis
In this analysis, we include non-Hispanic Whites, non-
Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican Americans; the number of
subjects of other racial/ethnic origin was too small to gener-
ate valid estimates.
Because age, sex, and race/ethnicity are important determi-
nants of memory and because subjects in older age groups,
females, and non-Hispanic Whites had lower bone mineral
density than those at a younger age, males, and non-Hispanic
Blacks, we created age-, gender-, and race/ethnicity-specific
categories based on femoral neck bone mineral density.
Specifically, we stratified all subjects into 96 strata according
to gender (two groups: male and female), age (16 groups: 2-
year age intervals), and ethnicity (three groups: non-Hispanic
Whites, non-Hispanic Blacks, and Mexican Americans).
Within each stratum we assigned each subject to a quintile of
bone mineral density.
We calculated the prevalence of verbal memory impair-
ment across different categories of potential confounding
factors for men and women separately. We estimated the
prevalence of verbal memory impairment according to the
quintile of bone mineral density and fitted a logistic
regression model to examine the relation of bone mineral
density to the prevalence of verbal memory impairment.
In a multiple logistic regression model, we adjusted for
education, alcohol consumption, smoking status, income,
history of stroke, and hypertension. Because the associa-
tion between bone mineral density and the prevalence of
verbal memory impairment was similar among men and
women, we also estimated the effect for both genders
combined.
Bone Density and Memory in the Elderly 797
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 9, 2001
We tested the significance of the trend in the prevalence
of verbal memory impairment by including a single variable
of quintile of bone mineral density in the multivariable
model. To determine whether the association between bone
mineral density and prevalence of verbal memory impair-
ment was modified by other risk factors, we examined the
effect of bone mineral density at the femur neck within
strata of other risk factors. We tested for statistical signifi-
cance of effect modification by including an interaction
term in the multivariable regression model. To evaluate
whether the association between bone mineral density and
prevalence of verbal memory impairment observed at the
femoral neck would also hold true at other bony sites, we
also assessed the effect of bone mineral density in other
proximal femur sites: trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's tri-
angle, and total proximal region.
To examine whether the association between bone min-
eral density and prevalence of verbal memory impairment
may vary depending on the cutpoint of the combined verbal
memory score, we tested our results using two other cut-
points for verbal memory impairment, that is, summary
score of <3 or summary score of <5.
Because NHANES III data were collected using a com-
plex sampling design, we used sample weights in all analy-
ses to account for unequal probability of selection and non-
response and to produce an estimate of prevalence that was
representative of the noninstitutionalized, civilian, US pop-
ulation. We used SUDAAN statistical software (27) to
incorporate sample weights and to account for the complex
survey design in the variance estimates.
RESULTS
Of the 6,596 subjects aged 60 years or over in NHANES
III, 872 did not have a health examination, 422 received only
a home examination, 159 were of other racial and ethnic
groups, 337 had missing information on memory testing (54
subjects had missing information on both tests, 112 subjects
had missing information on a delayed item recall only, and
171 subjects had missing information on a delayed story
recall), 480 had missing or unacceptable bone mineral density
data (30 subjects did not have bone mineral density measured,
and in 450 subjects bone mineral density measurements were
excluded because the values were considered outliers), and 22
had missing data on other potential risk factors. These sub-
jects (n  2,292) were excluded from the analysis. The char-
acteristics of the excluded subjects were similar to those of
the remaining subjects with regard to distribution by gender,
smoking status, and history of hypertension. However, com-
pared with excluded subjects, those remaining in the analysis
were younger (p < 0.001), more likely to be non-Hispanic
Whites (p < 0.001), and better educated; they also had a lower
percentage of lifetime abstention from alcohol (p  0.015),
higher annual income (p < 0.001), and a lower prevalence of
self-reported prior stroke (p  0.001). Of the remaining 4,304
subjects, the average score on testing verbal memory was
6.65 (standard error, 0.04), with 1.15 percent of subjects scor-
ing 0, 0.82 percent scoring 1, 1.64 percent scoring 2, 2.94 per-
cent scoring 3, and 5.13 percent scoring 4.
Table 1 presents the prevalence of verbal memory impair-
ment according to potential confounding factors in men and
women, respectively. A higher prevalence of verbal memory
impairment was associated with older age, non-Hispanic
Black ethnicity, fewer years of education, lower annual fam-
ily income, and lifetime alcohol abstinence among men and
women. Men with a history of stroke and nonsmoking
women showed a higher prevalence of verbal memory
impairment.
The prevalence of verbal memory impairment decreased as
bone mineral density at the femur neck increased in both men
and women (table 2). Compared with those in the lowest
quintile of bone mineral density, the multivariable-adjusted
prevalence odds ratios of verbal memory impairment for men
and women combined in each increased quintile of bone min-
eral density were 0.64 (95 percent confidence interval (CI):
0.43, 0.95), 0.65 (95 percent CI: 0.45, 0.92), 0.55 (95 percent
CI: 0.35, 0.87), and 0.44 (95 percent CI: 0.28, 0.69), respec-
tively (p for trend < 0.001). A similar association was also
found when the different cutpoints of combined score (<3 and
<5) were used to define verbal memory impairment (data not
presented). Significant associations were also observed
between bone mineral density at other proximal femoral sites
and the prevalence of verbal memory impairment (data not
presented). In light of the possibility that smoking and alco-
hol consumption could have a direct effect on estrogen levels,
so that adjusting for these factors might diminish the associa-
tion between bone mineral density and verbal memory
impairment, we removed these two risk factors from the
regression model; the results did not change materially.
An association between higher bone mineral density and
a lower prevalence of verbal memory impairment was con-
sistent across various strata of other risk factors, with the
exceptions being for Mexican Americans and current smok-
ers (table 3). No statistically significant interaction was
found between bone mineral density and verbal memory
impairment according to other risk factors.
DISCUSSION
Our results suggest that there is an association between
bone mineral density and the prevalence of verbal memory
impairment among the elderly: The prevalence of verbal
memory impairment decreased with increasing bone min-
eral density. This relation was consistent across almost all
strata of potential confounding factors and was robust when
different cutpoints were used to define verbal memory
impairment. Although the biologic mechanisms that link
high bone mineral density to a low prevalence of verbal
memory impairment are not fully understood, a high cumu-
lative estrogen exposure is one compelling explanation.
Thus, our results suggest that high levels of long-term estro-
gen exposure may be a critical element in the preservation
of verbal memory with aging.
To date, evidence for the beneficial effect of estrogen on
cognitive function in human subjects comes mainly from
studies of estrogen replacement therapy in postmenopausal
women. A few studies have indicated that estrogen replace-
ment therapy may improve verbal memory in healthy women
798 Zhang et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 154, No. 9, 2001
(6­8). Administration of estrogen to postmenopausal women
has been reported to induce significant modifications in brain
activation patterns as assessed by functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging or by a positron emission tomography scan
done while women perform verbal memory tasks (28, 29).
Results from epidemiologic studies, however, often suggest
that women who take estrogen replacement therapy tend to
be healthier, better educated, and more physically active (30,
31). Thus, the positive impact of estrogen replacement ther-
apy on memory function may be partly attributed to residual
confounding effects.
Only a few studies have examined the endogenous estro-
gen level in relation to verbal memory. Phillips and Sherwin
(2, 5) found that verbal memory was positively correlated
with estradiol levels through the menstrual cycle and
declined after surgical oophorectomy. Drake et al. (32) mea-
sured circulating sex hormone levels in 39 elderly, White,
nondemented subjects and found that high estradiol levels
were correlated with better performance on simultaneous
tests of verbal memory. However, Yaffe et al. (4) did not find
a consistent association between serum estrogen levels and
subsequent cognitive decline among elderly women. The
inconsistency among studies is probably due to measure-
ment error in the assessment of serum estrogen levels,
including fluctuation of endogenous estrogen levels over
time and different assay methods in different studies.
Furthermore, it is unlikely that a single measurement of
serum estrogen indicates a woman's cumulative exposure to
estrogen. Smith et al. (11) found that an index of lifetime
estrogen exposure computed from menstrual and reproduc-
tive histories was associated with verbal abilities in elderly
women. This index, however, is based on a retrospectively

ascertained history and may suffer from the biases inherent
in such a method.
Estrogens may affect cognitive function through various
mechanisms. Estradiol may decrease oxidative stress,
inhibit neuronal apoptosis, and promote synaptogenesis and
synaptic plasticity (33, 34). Estrogens also raise high density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels, reduce atherosclerosis, inhibit
endothelin-mediated vasoconstriction, promote vasodilata-
tion, and by all these means improve cerebral blood flow
(35­38).
The relation of estrogen level to bone mineral density has
been recognized for decades. Numerous studies have shown
that serum or urine estrogen levels are strongly associated
with bone mineral density in pre- and postmenopausal
women, and skeletal effects of low levels of estrogens are
clearly seen after menopause or removal of the ovaries
(39­44). In addition, women who have been receiving estro-
gen replacement therapy, especially long-term estrogen
users, have significantly higher bone mineral density than
do women who have never used estrogens (45, 46). These
findings, in conjunction with our and other investigators'
reports of an association between bone mass or bone min-
eral density and breast cancer risk (14, 15), suggest that
skeletal status may serve as a proxy for cumulative estrogen
exposure. Recently, Yaffe et al. (21) reported in a longitudi-
nal study that women with lower baseline levels of bone
mineral density and reductions in bone mineral density dur-
ing the follow-up, or vertebral fractures, had poorer cogni-
tive function and greater risk of cognitive deterioration. In
their study, subjects on estrogen replacement therapy were
excluded. In our main analysis we did not exclude subjects
who were receiving estrogen replacement therapy, because
we hypothesize that bone mineral density may serve as a
marker of cumulative estrogen exposure, including expo-
sure to exogenously administered estrogens. Nevertheless,
when we excluded 628 women who had hormone replace-
ment therapy from the analysis, a strong inverse relation
between bone mineral density and prevalence of verbal
memory impairment still exists.
Our findings of an association between bone mineral den-
sity and the prevalence of verbal memory impairment in
men are intriguing. Animal studies have shown that high
levels of endogenous androgens are associated with
improved memory in mice (47). Administration of testos-
terone to hypogonadal men, however, failed to improve ver-
bal memory (48). Instead, Kampen and Sherwin (49) found
that circulating levels of estradiol, but not testosterone, were
associated with better performance on tests of visual mem-
ory. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined the
relation of bone mineral density to the risk of verbal mem-
ory impairment in men. Studies have shown that testos-
terone, the predominant circulating androgen in men, is
positively correlated with bone mineral density in young
adult men (50­52). Such an association, however, has been
weak and inconsistent in elderly men (52­56). More
recently, evidence has been accumulated that estradiol lev-
els are strongly associated with bone mineral density in men
(16­19). Thus, high levels of cumulative estrogen exposure
may be one of the explanations for an inverse relation
between bone mineral density and verbal memory impair-
ment in men. Nevertheless, there may be other, as yet
unknown, mechanisms that result in both an increased
prevalence of verbal memory impairment and a decreased
bone mineral density.
This study has several limitations. First, the findings were
based on a cross-sectional survey; thus, we were unable to
establish the temporal relation between bone mineral den-
sity and verbal memory impairment. For instance, it is pos-
sible that subjects with severe verbal memory impairment
would be unable to maintain their previous levels of physi-
cal activity, resulting in loss of bone mineral density. If that
were the case, adjusting for physical activity level would
diminish an association between bone mineral density and
verbal memory impairment. Despite the fact that subjects
with a low physical activity level had a higher prevalence of
verbal memory impairment in NHANES III, adding physi-
cal activity level into the model had little, if any, effect on
the association. Similarly, subjects with a low verbal mem-
ory score may not practice other lifestyle measures that are
associated with a high bone mineral density. Second, we

were unable to adjust for some other potential confounding
factors, such as nutrition factors and general health status;
the residual confounding effects due to these factors may
account for such an association. Studies have shown that
depression in women is associated with a decreased bone
mineral density, and depression has also been related to ver-
bal memory impairment (57). We were unable to control for
the effect of depression because mood was not assessed
among subjects aged over 60 years in NHANES III; never-
theless, the effect of depression on memory impairment is
modest and unlikely to explain these findings (58). Third,
subjects with severe verbal memory impairment may have
been less likely to participate in NHANES III; this non-
response bias would lead to an underestimation of the preva-
lence of verbal memory impairment. However, there is no
reason to speculate that the nonrespondents, who were older
and had lower incomes than did the respondents, would
have a higher bone mineral density when compared with the
respondents who had memory impairment. Finally, this
analysis focuses on the prevalence of significant memory
impairment and does not address the association between
bone mineral density and milder degrees of memory loss.
The current study has several strengths as well. Numerous
studies have shown that, among cognitive functions, verbal
memory impairment is one of the strongest predictors of the
risk of dementia (22, 23); thus, the current findings are
clearly of clinical relevance. Second, the verbal memory test
used in this analysis consists of a simple three-item recall
test and a more challenging six-component story recall test;
the three-item test helps to reduce the chances of a "floor
effect." Finally, the combined score allowed us to use dif-
ferent cutpoints to define verbal memory impairment so that
we were able to perform sensitivity analyses. The method
used to assess bone mineral density is state-of-the-art, so
misclassification of exposure is unlikely to account for our
findings. In addition, the participants of the NHANES III
were randomly selected from the US population; therefore,
our results should be fairly generalizable to the elderly in the
United States.
In conclusion, results from the NHANES III suggest that
bone mineral density in elderly women and men is associ-
ated with performance on tests of verbal memory. Further
studies should extend this observation to examine the asso-
ciation between bone mineral density and clinical dementia.
