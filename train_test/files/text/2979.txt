THE PREVALENCE OF CONGESTIVE
heart failure (CHF), an impor-
tant cause of morbidity and mor-
tality, will increase with the ag-
ing of the US population. The incidence
of CHF doubles in each decade after the
age of 45 years, and CHF is the leading
hospital diagnosis in those older than 65
years.1 Risk factors such as hypertension
have been well described.2 However, data
are sparse regarding other risk factors for
CHF specifically in the elderly.
Pulse pressure (PP), measured as the
difference between systolic blood pres-
sure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure
(DBP), rises markedly after the fifth de-
cade due to arterial stiffening with age,
which results in a progressive rise in SBP
and fall in DBP as the elastic capacity of
the aorta diminishes.3-6 Arterial stiffness
increases afterload7,8 and myocardial oxy-
gen demand,9 impairs ventricular relax-
ation,10 and causes subendocardial ische-
mia in the presence 11,12 or absence13 of
coronaryarterystenoses.Theseeffectsmay
increase the susceptibility of the aging
heart to ischemia and ventricular dys-
function.
Arterial stiffness has been shown to be
a risk factor for cardiovascular disease
(CVD). In prospective cohorts, PP is as-
sociated with risk of myocardial infarc-
tion (MI)14-16 and CVD mortality17 in nor-
motensive and hypertensive populations,
as well as reinfarction and total mortality
after MI in patients with left ventricular
dysfunction.18 Measures of arterial stiff-
ness are strongly correlated with left ven-
tricular hypertrophy.19,20 However, none
of these studies examined the possible re-
lationship of arterial stiffness with CHF.
We addressed the hypothesis that in-
creased arterial stiffness may contribute
to CHF in the elderly, by prospectively
examining whether PP is an indepen-
dent predictor of CHF risk in a commu-
nity-based elderly cohort.

Context Arterial stiffness increases with age. Thus, pulse pressure, an index of ar-
terial stiffening, may predict congestive heart failure (CHF) in the elderly.
Objective To study prospectively the association between pulse pressure and risk
of CHF.
Design Prospective cohort study.
Setting The community-based East Boston Senior Health Project, East Boston, Mass.
Patients A total of 1621 men and women (mean [SD] age, 77.9 [5.0] years) free of
CHF who had blood pressure measurements taken in 1988-1989 and were followed
up for 3.8 years.
Main Outcome Measure Incidence of CHF as ascertained by hospital discharge
diagnosis (n = 208) and death certificates (n = 13).
Results After controlling for age, sex, mean arterial pressure, history of coronary heart
disease, diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and antihyperten-
sive medication use, pulse pressure was an independent predictor of CHF. For each
10-mm Hg elevation in pulse pressure, there was a 14% increase in risk of CHF (95%
confidence interval, 1.05-1.24; P = .003). Those in the highest tertile of pulse pressure
(67 mm Hg) had a 55% increased risk of CHF (P = .02) compared with those in the
lowest (54 mm Hg). Pulse pressure was more predictive than systolic blood pressure
alone and was independent of diastolic blood pressure.
Conclusion Pulse pressure, an easily measurable correlate of pulsatile hemody-
namic load, is an independent predictor of risk of CHF in this elderly cohort.

Medicare Provider Analysis and Review
files from the Health Care Financing
Administration (HCFA) provided infor-
mation on all hospital admissions and 5
discharge diagnoses per participant ad-
missionfrom1985to1992.Subjectswith
unavailableHCFAdata(n = 19)wereex-
cluded. Vital status through December
1992wasdeterminedthroughlocaldeath
notices,recordsoftheEastBostonNeigh-
borhood Health Center, and yearly link-
age with the National Death Index. For
theentirecohort,mortalityfollow-upwas
complete,and99.2%ofdeathcertificates
were obtained and coded by a single no-
sologistusingtheInternationalClassifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).
In 1988-1989, 2348 subjects pro-
vided follow-up data either in person or
through a proxy, 208 refused or were lost
tofollow-up,and1253haddied.Ofthese,
1810 had blood pressure (BP) measure-
ments. To define a cohort free of evi-
dence of prior CHF, we excluded those
with a prior HCFA diagnosis of CHF
(n=138)andthosewithoutapriorHCFA
diagnosis of CHF but who were taking
combinations of digoxin and loop diuret-
ics (n=25) or digoxin, loop diuretics, and
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibi-
tors (n = 6). We also excluded 20 sub-
jects with missing medication data. This
resultedinacohort of 1621 subjects with-
out known CHF who had complete BP
measurements and were followed up pro-
spectively for 3.8 years (median).
Exposure Variables
Using a standard mercury sphygmoma-
nometer, trained interviewers took 3 BP
measurements at 30-second intervals af-
ter the participant had been seated for
at least 5 minutes, using the protocol
from the Hypertension Detection and
Follow-up Program.21 Details of quality
control of BP measurements have been
published previously.22 The averages of
3 SBP and DBP measurements were used.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was de-
fined as {[SBP + (DBP  2)]/3}. Pulse
pressure was defined as SBP - DBP.
We assessed demographic character-
istics, medical history, functional abili-
ties, and health habits.23 Interviewers in-
spected all medication containers for
prescription and nonprescription drugs
taken in the prior 2 weeks. Drugs were
coded using the Drug Product Informa-
tion Coding System.
Hypertension was defined as any of the
following: self-report of high BP, previ-
ous HCFA diagnosis, use of antihyper-
tensive medications, or an SBP greater
than 160 mm Hg or a DBP greater than
90 mm Hg on examination. Diabetes
mellitus (DM) was defined by self-
report, use of insulin or oral hypoglyce-
mic agents, or previous HCFA diagno-
sis. Prevalent CHD (ICD-9 code 410-
414, prior percutaneous transluminal
coronary angioplasty or coronary artery
bypass grafting), valvular heart disease,
and atrial fibrillation (AF) were defined
by HCFAdiagnoses.Smokingstatus(cur-
rent, past, never) and alcohol use (none
in past year, none in past month, 15
g/d, 15 g/d) were categorized based on
self-report.
Outcome Measures
In a median of 3.8 years of follow-up, 221
subjects reached the end point of first
hospitalization with CHF, defined by
ICD-9 code 428 in any of 5 fields for any
hospitalization after the subject's 1988-
1989 evaluation (n = 208) or death with
CHF on the death certificate but no prior
HCFA diagnosis of CHF (n = 13).
Statistical Methods
We used analysis of variance for continu-
ous variables and tested for linear trends
for categorical variables to examine study
populationcharacteristicsstratifiedbyter-
tiles of PP. Linear regression models were
used to determine predictors of PP.
Participantscontributedfollow-uptime

tionin1988-1989tothedateoffirsthos-
pitalization with CHF, death, or end of
follow-up, whichever came first. Hazard
ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox
proportionalhazardsmodels,controlling
for age, to evaluate the association of BP
parameters with CHF risk. Continuous

mm Hg) were chosen to reflect clinically
relevantvalues.Becauseclinicallyrelevant
valuesareunknownforPP,tertilesofless
than 54 (referent), 54 to 67, and greater
than 67 mm Hg were chosen. Tests for

dinal variable for each category of the BP

HR,2-sidedPvaluesand95%confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated.
In analyses assessing the relationship
of PP with other CVD events and CHF,
we excluded participants with prior CHD
at baseline (n = 167), leaving a total of
1454 subjects of whom 190 developed
CHF, 118 had nonfatal or fatal MIs (de-
fined as the primary or underlying cause
of death on the death certificate, with-
out prior known CHD), and 68 died with
CVD attributed as the immediate or un-
derlying cause of death. In multivariate
proportional hazards models, we exam-
ined the relationship of PP with MI and
total CVD (259 first events of MI, CHF,
or CVD death). To assess whether the as-
sociation between PP and CHF risk is me-
diated through CHD, subjects with MI
occurring before or after the incident
CHF hospitalization were excluded, or
MI was controlled for.
Effect modification by sex, DM, and
CHF risk factor status (defined as having
any of the following: DM, CHD, AF, val-
vular heart disease, or antihypertensive
medication use) was also examined.

and predominantly female (66.1%).
Prevalent conditions at baseline in-
cluded hypertension (54.6%), DM
(19.3%), CHD (10.3%), AF (2.8%), and
valvular heart disease (1.8%). Nearly half
(45.6%) were taking antihypertensive
medications,and12%werecurrentsmok-
ers. Mean (SD) BP parameters included
SBP of 137 (19), DBP of 75 (10), MAP of
96 (11), and PP of 62 (17) mm Hg.
Age, MAP, presence of DM, hyperten-
sion, vascular heart disease, and use of
antihypertensive medication signifi-
cantly increased with tertiles of PP
(TABLE 1). Sex, CHD, smoking status,
and AF were not related to PP. In a mul-
tivariate regression model, indepen-
dent predictors of PP included age, MAP,
and DM (all P.001), antihypertensive
medication use (P = .002), and valvular
heart disease (P = .008). Using Spear-
man rank order correlation coefficients
(r), PP was correlated with MAP (r =0.41;
P.001) and SBP (r = 0.83; P.001); the
correlation of PP with DBP was small al-
though statistically significant (r = -0.07;
P = .004). Systolic blood pressure and
DBP were also correlated (r = 0.44;
P.001).
BP and CHF Risk
Age was a strong univariate predictor of
CHF risk (HR, 1.44/5 y; 95% CI, 1.28-
1.61; P.001). After controlling for age
(FIGURE), systolic blood pressure had a
graded relationship with increasing risk
of CHF (P for trend, .001) with a 12%
increase in risk for every 10-mm Hg rise
in SBP (95% CI, 1.05 -1.20). Diastolic
blood pressure, however, tended to have
a U-shaped relationship with CHF risk.
Compared with subjects whose DBP
ranged from 70 to 79 mm Hg, those with
DBPs less than 70, 80 to 89, and greater
than 90 mm Hg had HRs of 1.60 (95%
CI, 1.17-2.20; P = .003), 1.10 (95% CI,
0.76-1.60; P = .60), and 1.69 (95% CI,
1.05-2.78; P = .04), respectively. Pulse
pressure had a significant linear relation-
ship with CHF risk (P for trend, .001),
with an age-adjusted 17% increase in risk
for every 10-mm Hg rise in PP (95% CI,
1.09-1.26). Subjects in the highest ter-
tile of PP had a 75% increase in risk of
CHF (95% CI, 1.25-2.45; P = .001) com-
pared with those in the lowest. The re-
lationship of PP to CHF risk was not ma-
terially altered by the presence (to control
for the steady component of BP)4 or ab-
sence of MAP in the model. MAP had no
association with CHF in these data.
After adjusting for age, use of antihy-
pertensive medications, DM, valvular
heart disease, and AF were significant
predictors of CHF (TABLE 2). Sex, smok-
ing, and alcohol use were not associ-
ated with CHF risk. Coronary heart dis-
ease was included as a covariate in the
multivariate models with the age-
adjusted association of borderline
significance (P = .07).
In a multivariate proportional haz-
ards model controlling for age, sex, MAP,
CHD, and significant univariate predic-
tors of CHF risk (DM, AF, valvular dis-
ease, antihypertensive medication use),
PP was a significant independent pre-
dictor of CHF (P for trend, .003) (Table
2). Every 10-mm Hg rise in PP was as-
sociated with a 14% increase in risk of
CHF (95% CI, 1.05-1.24). Subjects in the
highest tertile (PP67 mm Hg) had a
55% greater risk of CHF (P = .02) com-
pared with those in the lowest (PP54
mm Hg).
We addressed the relative importance
of PP, SBP, and DBP in predicting CHF
risk in multivariate proportional haz-
ards models examining BP parameters
alone and in combination (TABLE 3).
When PP and SBP were examined in the
same model, PP remained a significant in-
dependent predictor of CHF risk (HR per
10-mm Hg increase in PP, 1.16; 95% CI,
1.00-1.35; P = .049), while SBP did not

(HR/10 mm Hg, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.84-
1.11; P = .63), suggesting that PP pro-
videsadditionalpredictiveinformationin-
dependent of SBP alone. In a separate
multivariate model of PP and DBP, the ef-
fect of PP (HR/10 mm Hg, 1.12; 95% CI,
1.04-1.20; P = .003) on CHF risk was in-
dependent of DBP. In this model, a DBP
of less than 70 mm Hg (HR, 1.54; 95%
CI, 1.12-2.12; P = .007), which is an ad-
ditional correlate with large artery stiff-
ness,3 was also independently associated
with CHF risk. In these analyses, PP was
independent of SBP and DBP, was more
informative than SBP alone, and was ad-
ditive to DBP in predicting CHF risk.
PP and CHD Events
In prior prospective studies in middle-
aged cohorts,14-18 PP was a predictor of
MI and CVD death. In this elderly popu-
lation, after excluding those with preva-
lent CHD at baseline, PP was associated
with small numbers of incident MI, but
this was of borderline statistical signifi-
cance after multivariate adjustment (HR
per 10-mm Hg increase in PP, 1.11; 95%
CI, 0.99-1.24; P = .07). For total CVD,
a combined end point of CHF, MI, or
death due to CVD, PP was a significant
independent predictor of total CVD risk
(HR/10 mm Hg, 1.12/10 mm Hg; 95%
CI, 1.03-1.21; P = .006). After exclud-
ing subjects with MI occuring before or
after the incident CHF presentation, PP
remained a significant predictor of CHF
(multivariate HR/10 mm Hg, 1.15; 95%
CI, 1.02-1.29; P = .02). When those sub-
jects were included and MI was con-
trolled for, the HR was 1.11 (95% CI,
1.01-1.22; P = .03). Thus, the associa-
tion of PP with CHF risk was indepen-
dent of MI and was observed in those
without evidence of CHD.
Effect Modification
There were no significant interactions be-
tween PP and DBP, sex, DM, antihyper-
tensive medication use, or CHF risk fac-
tor status. However, the association
between PP and CHF risk was some-
what stronger in men and those with-
out CHF risk factors (TABLE 4). Diabe-
tes mellitus did not appear to alter the
association between PP and CHF risk.
Pulse pressure was not a significant pre-
dictor of CHF risk in the subgroup of pa-
tients taking antihypertensive medica-
tions. This is most likely a chance finding
in this subgroup, or possibly a reflec-
tion of the effects of treatment, but we
do not have adequate power to address
this issue and had not specified this hy-
pothesis a priori.
COMMENT
Pulse pressure, an easily measurable cor-
relate of arterial stiffness and pulsatile he-
modynamic load,3-5 was an indepen-
dent predictor of CHF risk in this
prospective cohort. Pulse pressure was
the single most informative BP param-
eter, as it best captures the physiologi-
cal sequelae of arterial stiffness as re-
flected in disproportionately elevated
SBP, decreased DBP, or both. These data
support the hypothesis that the relative
importance of BP components in pre-
dicting CVD risk varies with age, with
PP emerging as a better marker for vas-
cular overload in the elderly.3,24
Prior studies of risk factors for CHF
focused on systolic or diastolic hyper-
tension,2 and limited data exist regard-
ing the role of specific BP components.
In the Framingham Heart Study, PP was
a better predictor than SBP of CHF risk
in men, especially after age 65 years, but
not in women.25 In elderly patients with
isolated systolic hypertension, a signifi-
cant subgroup of those with age-related
vascular stiffening and increased PP3,4
treatment reduced the risk of fatal or
nonfatal CHF by 49% in 4.5 years of
follow-up.26

Pulse pressure reflects the complex in-
teraction between intermittent cardiac
ejection and the dynamic properties of
the large arteries.3-5 The distensible, elas-
tic aorta transiently stores part of the
stroke volume during each systole and
transmits this volume forward in dias-
tole as its walls recoil. This limits end-
systolic pressure and wall tension8 and
maintains diastolic perfusion pressure.
The progressive loss of aortic compli-
ance with age, due to elastin fragmenta-
tion and increased collagen deposi-
tion,27 results in elevation in PP, from the
associated rise in SBP and fall in DBP.
Several plausible mechanisms may ex-
plain an association between increased
PP and CHF. Increased afterload7,8 and
premature return of reflected waves in
late systole28 impose a greater load on the
ventricle, reducing ejection fraction8 and
increasing myocardial oxygen de-
mand.9 Diastolic relaxation is also im-
paired.10 Conduit vessel stiffness may in-
crease vulnerability to ischemia as well.
The increase in systolic load and myo-
cardial work, coupled with the fall in di-
astolic coronary perfusion pressure, re-
sults in subendocardial ischemia with11,12
and without coronary artery stenoses.13
Arterial stiffness is strongly correlated
with left ventricular hypertrophy in nor-
motensive20 and hypertensive19 sub-
jects and with left ventricular mass in
population-based cohorts,14,29 a plau-
sible consequence of its excess hemody-
namic load and a known risk factor for
CHF and CVD events.30
In addition to hemodynamic conse-
quences, the association between el-
evated PP and CHF risk may in part be
mediated by CHD. Arterial stiffness is
correlated with atherosclerosis31,32 and
may promote primary atheroma devel-
opment, possibly mediated by greater cy-
clic wall stress.33,34 Several prospective
studies14-18 in middle-aged populations
support the hypothesis that higher PP is
associated with increased CHD, but none
addressed its relationship with CHF. In
our data of the elderly, the association
between PP and CHF was independent
of CHD, suggesting that it may be me-
diated by other adverse effects of arte-
rial stiffness on hemodynamics, systolic
and diastolic function, and myocardial
perfusion.
These findings have potential preven-
tive and therapeutic implications regard-
ing modifiability of arterial stiffness and
perhaps risk of CHF. For example, an-
giotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
cause greater regression of left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy than other vasodilators
despite lowering MAP to the same de-
gree.35 This may be due to reduction in
pulsatile load and premature wave re-
flection35 or modulation of renin-
angiotensin system effects on arterial
compliance.36 Nitrates37 and low-salt di-
ets38 improve arterial distensibility. Ad-
verse effects on coronary blood supply,
including decreased diastolic perfusion
pressure11,13 and a greater proportion of
myocardial perfusion occurring in sys-
tole,12,39 may have implications for treat-
ment of elderly patients with CHD, in
whom hearts perfused by wide PPs may
be more sensitive to reductions in SBP
and MAP.39 As recently described,12 in-
creased pulsatile load during acute coro-
nary occlusion resulted in a 3-fold de-
cline in ejection fraction, marked fall in
SBP, and doubling of ischemic mass. This
may contribute to the greater severity of
CHF and left ventricular dysfunction seen
in the elderly after MI, independent of
the severity of coronary stenosis.12
Several issues regarding our study
methods should be addressed. Brachial
artery BPs by sphygmomanometry are
less accurate in measuring central pres-
sure than more invasive or technologi-
cally advanced methods. However, this
type of BP measurement is easily ob-
tained in a clinical setting, and in an el-
derly population, such as ours, periph-
eral and central PP are better correlated
than in younger subjects.3,4 We also used
the average of 3 BPs taken by Hyperten-
sion Detection and Follow-up Pro-
gram21 protocol to increase the accu-
racy of our measurements. In other
prospective studies,14,18 even a single, ca-
sual BP measurement yielded signifi-
cant positive associations between PP and
CVD events.
While we used HCFA diagnoses to
identify end points, a validation study
found that ICD-9 codes for CHF (428,
402) had sensitivities and positive pre-
dictive values, respectively, of 0.89 and
0.71 in any position, and 0.85 and 0.87
in the principal position.40 In a study of
Medicare admissions in 1991 and 1992
in 4 states, the principal diagnosis of CHF
(ICD-9 code 428) was confirmed by clini-
cal criteria in 95.7% of cases.41 When we
restricted our analysis to CHF as the prin-
cipal diagnosis, the magnitude of asso-
ciation was not materially altered, al-
though the CI widened due to the smaller
number of end points. Hospitalization is
a reasonable but imperfect indicator of
incident CHF. While most patients re-
quire hospitalization at some point in
their disease course, this method is bi-
ased toward selection of sicker patients
and will not identify nonhospitalized
cases of CHF. A potential limitation is that
some subjects may have had CHF at base-
line. Given the natural history of CHF,
with its poor prognosis and high rate of

hospitalization,1 we sought to address this
by excluding subjects at baseline with a
prior HCFA diagnosis in the preceding
3 years or with evidence of active drug
therapy consistent with CHF treat-
ment.
Whether our findings apply to popu-
lations in middle age requires further
study. The pathophysiology of arterial
stiffness suggests that the association be-
tween PP and CHF risk may apply pre-
dominantly to the elderly. We do not
have data about left ventricular func-
tion in these subjects but speculate that
a link may exist between progressive ar-
terial stiffness, with its adverse effects on
ventricular relaxation, loading condi-
tions, and myocardial perfusion, and the
increase in diastolic heart failure ob-
served in the elderly.
In summary, in this prospective study
of a community-based elderly cohort, PP
was independently and linearly associ-
ated with risk of CHF. Pulse pressure may
be a clinically useful tool to identify el-
derly subjects at risk for CHF, who may
benefit from treatment to improve arte-
rial compliance. More research is needed
to further examine the relationship of
arterial compliance with its cardiovas-
cular sequelae, as well as the possible
benefits of therapies specifically de-
signed to prevent or treat the vascular pa-
thology associated with elevated pulse
pressure.
