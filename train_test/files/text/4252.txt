Abstract
The aggregation and formation of amyloid plaques by amyloid b-peptides (Abs) is believed to be one of the pathological
hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intriguingly, Abs have also been shown to possess proliferative effects on neural stem
cells (NSCs). Many essential cellular processes in NSCs, such as fate determination and proliferation, are heavily influenced by
cell surface glycoconjugates, including gangliosides. It has recently been shown that Ab1-42 alters several key glycosyltrans-
ferases and glycosidases. To further define the effects of Abs and to clarify the potential mechanisms of action of those
peptides on NSCs, NSCs were cultured from embryonic brains of the double-transgenic mouse model of AD [B6C3-
Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J] coexpressing mutants of amyloid precursor protein (APPswe) and presenilin1
(PSEN1dE9). We found that Abs not only promoted cell proliferation but also altered expression of several key glycogenes
for glycoconjugate metabolism, such as sialyltransferases II and III (ST-II & -III) in AD NSCs. In addition, we found upregulation
of epidermal growth factor receptor and Notch1 intracellular domain. Moreover, the increased expression of ST-II and -III
coincided with the elevated levels of c-series gangliosides (A2B5þ antigens) in AD NSCs. Further, we revealed that epidermal
growth factor signaling and gangliosides are necessary components on Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation. Our present study
has thus provided a novel mechanism for the upregulation of c-series ganglioside expression and increases in several NSC
markers to account for the proliferative effect of Abs on NSCs in AD mouse brain. These observations support the potential
beneficial effects of Abs and gangliosides in promoting neurogenesis in AD brain.

Introduction
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of
dementia and a severe neurodegenerative disorder with
clinical symptoms that include deficits in memory, judg-
ment, thinking, and behavior. These symptoms usually
develop slowly and become worse over time. They inter-
fere with daily tasks and ultimately lead to death. It is
well accepted that deposition of aggregated amyloid b-
peptide (Ab) to form amyloid plaques, also known as
senile plaques, together with associated reactive astrocy-
tosis and dystrophic neuritis, represent major patho-
logical hallmarks of AD (Selkoe, 1997, 2013). The most
studied physiologically relevant Abs include 4-kDa pep-
tides, including two dominant forms Ab1-40 and Ab1-42.
Abs are derived from proteolytic cleavage of amyloid
precursor protein (APP). The two dominant forms of
Abs have a high tendency to assemble initially into the
soluble form and later to insoluble aggregated fibrils as
extracellular amyloid plaques in the AD brain.
Intermediate soluble oligomers of Abs, rather than the
aggregated Abs, are increasingly recognized as having
cellular toxicity in AD (Kuo et al., 1996; Lansbury,
1999; Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Lesne et al., 2006; Liu
et al., 2015). Genetic linkage analyses of familial cases
of AD have identified APP and presenilins as the highest
risk factors for AD pathogenesis (Guerreiro et al., 2013).
During normal metabolism of amyloid protein (APP),
Ab1-40 is abundantly produced. However, mutations of

APP and presenilins elevate the secretion of Abs, espe-
cially the more abundant form Ab1-42 (Selkoe, 1999,
2013). Approximately 1% of freshly dissolved monomeric
Ab1-40s forms dimers, but under the same conditions,
about 7.4% of Ab1-42 is converted to the dimeric form
(Roher et al., 1996). This observation suggests that the
soluble form of Ab1-42 has a higher tendency to exist as a
dimer. Ab dimers are the most abundant form of soluble
oligomers in the cortex of AD patients (Jin et al., 2011).
Abs are produced by cultured cells as part of the normal
cellular metabolism (Haass et al., 1992; Seubert et al.,
1992). Because Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 are present in the
brain and cerebrospinal fluid of normal individuals, it
suggests that these peptides may possess certain physio-
logical activities in normal life (Shoji, 2002). Despite
extensive efforts for studying Abs for their cytotoxic
effects in AD, the normal biological functions and posi-
tive effects of Abs have remained elusive. With respect to
their impact on neural stem cells (NSCs), we and others
have reported that Ab1-42 promoted NSC proliferation
(Lopez-Toledano and Shelanski, 2004; Heo et al., 2007;
Sotthibundhu et al., 2009; Diaz-Moreno et al., 2013;
Itokazu et al., 2013; Itokazu and Yu, 2014), presumably
due to the fact that Ab1-42 stimulated Notch signaling
and upregulated the expression of fucosyltransferase-IX
(FUT9), which is a key enzyme for the synthesis of the
Lewis x carbohydrate epitope (Itokazu and Yu, 2014).
Gangliosides are sialic acid-containing glycosphingoli-
pids expressed primarily in the outer leaflet of the plasma
membrane of all vertebrate cells and are particularly
abundant in the nervous system (Ngamukote et al.,
2007; Yu and Itokazu, 2014; Yu et al., 2012). During
cellular differentiation and brain development, it is
known that dramatic and consistent changes in the com-
position of neural gangliosides occur (Yu et al., 1988;
Ngamukote et al., 2007). In rodent brain, a shift from
the synthesis of simple gangliosides, such as GM3 and
GD3, to the synthesis of the more complex gangliosides
in the a- and b-series, particularly GM1, GD1a, GD1b,
and GT1b, during brain development has been well docu-
mented. A2B5 monoclonal antibody was reported in 1979
(Eisenbarth et al., 1979), and it recognizes c-series gan-
gliosides, including GQ1c, GT1c, and GT3 (Kasai and
Yu, 1983; Saito et al., 2001). The c-series gangliosides
are abundant in embryonic mammalian brains but are
present in extremely low amount in adult brains
(Ngamukote et al., 2007). Stage-specific embryonic anti-
gen-1 (SSEA-1/Lewis X/CD15) is a well-known carbohy-
drate antigenic epitope of undifferentiated cells and has
been recognized as an NSC marker (Yu and Itokazu,
2014). The 3-fucosyl-N-acetyllactosamine or Lewis X
carbohydrate structure is defined as [Galb1-4(Fuca1-
3)GlcNAcb-]. Lewis X carbohydrate epitope is synthe-
sized by transferring a fucosyl residue from GDP-fucose
to N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by the action of a1,3-
FUT9 (Kudo et al., 1998). Recently, we showed that
FUT9 knockdown in mouse NSCs impaired Musashi-1
expression and NSC proliferation, suggesting that NSC
proliferation can be modulated by FUT9 and the Notch
signaling pathway (Yagi et al., 2012).
At present, there has not been any effective therapy to
halt the progression of AD, although it is generally
accepted that it is more promising to halt the progression
of AD during the earlier stages (Bateman, 2015). With the
advent of stem cell therapy, it is expected that the use of
NSCs may contribute to the treatment of AD as well as
several other neurodegenerative disorders. NSCs are
undifferentiated neural cells characterized by the capacity
for self-renewal and proliferation with retention of multi-
potency, that is, generating brain-forming cells such as
neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. For the thera-
peutic use of NSCs in AD, a detailed clarification of the
effects of Abs and gangliosides on NSCs is warranted. In
this study, we investigated the possible interactions
between gangliosides and NSC proliferation in AD
brain. Here, we demonstrated that NSCs from embryonic
brains of a double-transgenic mouse model of AD have
increased capacity for proliferation with upregulation of
key glycogenes for c-series gangliosides synthesis, such as
sialyltransferases II and III (ST-II and-III). Both are key
enzymes involved in the synthesis of c-series gangliosides
whose expression is characteristic of NSCs. The increased
expression of ST-II and -III elevated levels of c-series
gangliosides (A2B5-antigen). In AD NSCs, NSC-
associated markers, such as epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) and Notch1 intracellular domain
(NICD), were upregulated. Interestingly, our results
revealed that EGF and b/c-series gangliosides are
required for Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation. Our pre-
sent study thus provides a novel mechanism for NSC
proliferation in AD brain tightly regulated by ganglio-
sides and suggests that Abs and gangliosides could be
used as potential therapeutic targets for promoting
neurogenesis in AD brain.
Materials and Methods
Materials
Ab1-42 was purchased from Bachem Americas (Torrance,
CA). Freshly prepared soluble Abs were used for the experi-
ment. Antibodies used were as follows: anti-Notch-1 (mouse;
BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), anti-EGFR (rabbit; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and antiactin (rabbit;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
NSC Culture
AD mice [B6C3-Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J]
(Jankowsky et al., 2001) were purchased from the
2 ASN Neuro
Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and ST-II-
knockout (KO) mice were originally provided by the
courtesy of Dr. Richard Proia (NIDDK, NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Wild-type (WT) littermates of these
mice were used for control. Mouse NSCs were prepared
from embryonic brains in the form of neurospheres,
which were floating clonal aggregates formed by NSCs
in vitro (Nakatani et al., 2010). In brief, single-cell sus-
pensions were prepared from the striata of embryonic day
(E)-14.5 mouse brains. NSCs were cultured in
Neurobasal A medium (Life Technologies, Carlsbad,
CA) supplemented with B27 (Life Technologies) and
20 ng/ml of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2;
Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) and 20 ng/ml of EGF
(Peprotech). Neurospheres formed after 1 week were col-
lected for further passages and analyses. The use of ani-
mals for this study was approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees at Georgia Regents
University and the VA Medical Center, Augusta, GA.
WST-8 Assay
The number of cultured NSCs was estimated by the
WST-8 assay using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo,
Kumamoto, Japan). The dissociated NSCs from neuro-
spheres were plated at a density of 1 Â 104 cells per well
onto 96-well plates that had been coated with poly-L-
ornithine (Sigma-Aldrich) and fibronectin (Sigma-
Aldrich). After 3 days of culture, 10 ml of WST-8 solution
was added to each well. After incubating for 3 hr in a CO2
incubator, the spectrophotometric absorbance of WST-
8-formazan produced by the dehydrogenase activity in
the living neural cells was measured at the wavelength
of 450 nm using a Benchmark Plus Microplate
Spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). The spectrophotometric absorbance measured by
this assay was highly correlated with the number of
living NSCs (Kanemura et al., 2002; Itokazu et al.,
2013; Itokazu and Yu, 2014). For adding Ab1-42, Abs
freshly dissolved in media were replaced to each well on
the next day after cell plating, and WST-8 analysis was
performed on those cells after 3 days.
Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Total RNA samples were isolated from cultured NSCs
using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies). cDNAs
were synthesized based on the total RNAs as templates
using MultiScribeTM Reverse Transcriptase (Applied
Bioscience). PCR was performed using ReadyMixTM
REDTaqÕ (Sigma-Aldrich) with the following settings:
94C for 5 min; 26 to 40 cycles of 94C for 30 s, 60C
for 30 s, and 72C for 30 s; and 72C for 5 min. PCR
products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
using 1.5% agarose gels containing SYBR SafeTM
DNA Gel stain (Life Technologies). The bands were
quantified using the NIH ImageJ 1.46 r image processing
program (rsb.info.nih.gov) to reflect the original mRNA
levels. Densitometric data were normalized against b-
actin mRNA. The normalized value from control (WT)
is defined as 1.0. Primer sequences are described else-
where (Ngamukote et al., 2007; Nakatani et al., 2010;
Itokazu and Yu, 2014).
Western Blotting
NSCs were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer contain-
ing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaF, 1 mM
Na3
VO4
, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate, pH 7.5, supplemented with a
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied
Science, Indianapolis, IN), and then centrifuged at
12,000 Â g and 4C for 10 min. Supernatants (cell lysates)
were collected, and the protein concentrations were mea-
sured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit
(Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford, IL). Proteins
were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (8% gel) under reducing conditions
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes.
The membranes were probed with primary antibodies fol-
lowed by appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences). Signals
were visualized with Western Lightning Western blot
chemiluminescence reagent (Perkin Elmer Life
and Analytical Sciences, Boston, MA). The bands were
quantified using the NIH ImageJ. Densitometric values
were normalized by setting the NICD/actin or EGFR/
actin protein ratio for control (WT) in each treatment.
The normalized value from control (WT) is defined
as 1.0.
Immunocytochemistry
Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20min at
room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and
blocked with 5% goat serum and 1% BSA for 30min.
The treated cells were then incubated with antibodies over-
night in a chamber with a humid atmosphere at 4C. The
primary antibody used was an anti-A2B5 mouse antibody
(IgM). After incubation with the primary antibody,
the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated
with Alexa 488 anti-mouse IgM antibody (Thermo Fisher
Scientific Inc.) for 2 hr in the dark, washed and then
incubated with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) for 5 min to stain the nuclei.
Specimens were mounted in Fluoro-Gel from Electron
Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA) and observed using a
Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss GmbH,
Jena, Germany).

p < .05 was regarded as significant.
Results
Increased Number of NSCs in AD Mouse Brain
We have reported that supplemented Ab1-42 promotes
mouse NSC proliferation (Itokazu et al., 2013; Itokazu
and Yu, 2014). In the previous study, to evaluate cell
death accompanied by DNA fragmentation, terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end
labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed after Ab treat-
ments. It has revealed that there were no significant
TUNEL-positive cells in the intact cells and NSCs treated
with Abs (Itokazu et al., 2013). That result was also in
accord with our previous report showing that the expres-
sion of active caspase 3 was not different in intact cells
and NSCs treated with the soluble form of Abs
(Yanagisawa et al., 2010). Those results suggest that the
increase of NSC number upon treatment with Abs was
likely caused by cell proliferation rather than by protec-
tion the cells from undergoing apoptosis.
NSCs were cultured from embryonic brains (E 14.5) of
the double-transgenic mouse model of AD coexpressing
mutants of APP (APPswe) and presenilin1 (PSEN1dE9).
The dissociated NSCs (from neurospheres) were plated at
a density of 1 Â 104 cells/well onto 96-well plates, coated
with poly-L-ornithine and fibronectin. After 3 days of
culture, the number of NSCs was estimated by the
WST-8 assay. The absorbance measured by this assay
was highly correlative with the number of living NSCs
(Kanemura et al., 2002). NSCs from AD mouse model
(AD NSCs) significantly increased the number of cells
compared with their littermate WT (Figure 1).
Recently, it was reported that all of the NSCs from this
AD mice are immunopositive for anti-Ab monoclonal
antibody (6E10) and that Ab monomers (Ab1-40 and 1-
42) and a wide range of oligomers are detected in both
cell lysate and culture media of AD NSCs, but these pep-
tides are not expressed in NSCs of their WT littermates
(Ghate et al., 2014).
Expression of NSC-Associated Markers
Many essential cellular processes, such as fate determin-
ation and proliferation, in NSCs are profoundly influ-
enced by cell surface glycoconjugates whose expression
is dramatically altered during differentiation. FUT9 is a
key enzyme for the synthesis of Lewis X-carrying
N-glycans, which has been used as an NSC marker
(Yu and Itokazu, 2014). In our previous study, FUT9
was shown to increase following treatment by Ab1-42,
which is expected to affect NSC proliferation (Itokazu
and Yu, 2014). For this reason, we analyzed the gene
expression level of FUT9 as well as cell lineage-associated
markers in AD NSCs (Figure 2(a)). The expression of
FUT9 increased in AD NSCs. FUT9 was reported to
be controlled by Pax6 that promotes proliferation of
neural progenitor cells and neurogenesis, and it was
revealed that Pax6 mRNA expression was increased in
AD NSCs. Other NSC markers, such as Musashi-1 and
SOX2, were also upregulated in AD NSCs. On the other
hand, the expression of the mRNA of a glial marker (glial
fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) was not significantly
altered. These are consistent with the fact that Ab1-42
stimulated FUT9, Pax6, and Musashi-1 expression as
shown by our reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) experiment in a previous study
(Itokazu and Yu, 2014). The expression of the mRNA
of a neuronal marker (microtubule-associated protein 2)
is also elevated.

Because we previously showed that NICD was
increased in Ab1-42-stimulated proliferating NSCs
(Itokazu and Yu, 2014), we performed Western blot ana-
lyses to examine the protein expression of Notch (Figure
2(b)). Western blot analysis shows that the protein
expression of NICD was upregulated in AD NSCs. In
addition to the Notch signaling pathway, the EGFR
pathway is also important to regulate stem cell
proliferation. It is known that both pathways are capable
of regulating the NSC number and self-renewal capability
(Aguirre et al., 2010). We also examined the protein
expression level of EGFR and found that the EGFR
expression was significantly elevated in AD NSCs
(Figure 2(b)). These data are consistent with the notion
that both Notch and EGFR pathways are contributing to
the enhanced cell proliferation for AD NSCs.

Key Glycosyltransferase and c-Series Ganglioside
Expressions
ST-II and -III are key glycosyltransferases for synthesis
of c-series gangliosides whose expression is characteristic
of NSCs (Figure 3(a)). We performed RT-PCR experi-
ments and semiquantified gene expressions of ST-II and -
III. We found increased expression of ST-II and -III in
AD NSCs (Figure 3(b)). Next, we evaluated the expres-
sion of A2B5 antigens, including c-series gangliosides, by
immunocytochemistry. The increased expression of ST-II
and -III resulted in elevated levels of c-series gangliosides
(A2B5-antigens) in AD NSCs (Figure 3(c)). These data
suggest that c-series gangliosides may also be associated
with NSC proliferation in AD.
EGF Is Required for Increased NSC
Proliferation in AD
We found that the expression of EGFR was significantly
increased in AD NSCs (Figure 2(b)). We previously
reported that ST-II-KO NSCs that were cultured with
EGF showed significantly suppressed cellular prolifer-
ation (Wang and Yu, 2013). Surprisingly, however, no
difference in the proliferation rate and expression of line-
age-associated markers was found between ST-IIþ/þ
(WT) NSCs and ST-II-KO NSCs that were cultured in
the presence of FGF2 but in the absence of EGF (Yu
and Yanagisawa, 2007). Accordingly, this ganglioside-
dependent NSC proliferation is considered to be
regulated mainly through the EGFR signaling pathway.
To investigate whether the increase of cell proliferation in
AD NSCs was dependent EGFR-signaling, we cultured
AD NSCs in the absence of EGF. It was revealed
that AD NSCs did not show any increased cell prolifer-
ation under this condition (Figure 4(a)). Because FGF2 is
known to maintain NSC proliferation even in the absence
of EGF (Yanagisawa et al., 2010), the results clearly
showed that EGFR signaling is a key pathway for
Ab-induced NSC proliferation.
Gangliosides Are Required for A-Stimulated
NSC Proliferation
The earlier results suggest that the enhanced cell prolifer-
ation in AD NSC could depend on gangliosides through
the EGFR-signaling (Wang and Yu, 2013). To evaluate
this possibility, NSCs were isolated from ST-II-KO mice
in which GD3 and its downstream products, including b-
and c-series gangliosides, are missing (Figure 3(a)), and
their WT littermates. Figure 4(b) shows that Ab1-42 dra-
matically increased WT NSC proliferation as similar as
shown in Figure 1. Most intriguingly, however, Ab1-42
could not stimulate cell proliferation on ST-II-KO NSCs.
The results clearly show that b- or c-series gangliosides
are required for Ab1-42-induced NSC proliferation.
Discussion
The present study provides the first direct evidence that
gangliosides are required for Ab-stimulated NSC prolif-
eration. We and others have previously reported that

supplemented soluble Ab1-42-stimulated NSC prolifer-
ation. In this study, we discovered that NSCs from an
mouse AD model [B6.Cg-Tg (APPswe,PSEN1

upregulation of ganglioside expression. Recently, NSCs
have been cultured from this AD model mouse (Ghate
et al., 2014), and these AD NSCs are confirmed to highly
express APP and its proteolytic peptides including both
Ab monomer and a wide range of pathogenic oligomers
(2 to 14-mers) in vitro culture. Ab peptides (1-40 and 1-
42) were detected only in AD NSCs, but they were not
expressed in NSCs from their WT littermates. These
authors did not find any signs of cytotoxicity in these
AD NSCs (Ghate et al., 2014). In our previous study,
soluble Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 did not affect the number
of apoptotic cells on NSCs (Itokazu et al., 2013). Taken

together, it suggests that the increase of the number of
NSCs in AD was likely caused by enhanced cell prolifer-
ation rather than by protection the cells from apoptosis.
Notch and EGFR pathways are important to control
stem cell fate determination, and it is known to regulate
NSC number and self-renewal via these pathways
(Aguirre et al., 2010). We showed that NICD was
increased in AD NSCs (Figure 2(b)). Presenilins are a
necessary substrate transporter and the catalytic compo-
nent of g-secretase (van Tijn et al., 2011). g-Secretase is a
transmembrane enzyme that cleaves APP and catalyzes
the formation of Ab peptides. g-Secretase also cleaves
Notch and releases NICD that is translocated to the
nucleus to regulate expression of genes important for
development (Hardy and Israel, 1999). The mutation of
PSEN1dE9 in AD models lacks the endoproteolytic
cleavage site which is located at exon 9 of presenilin1,
and this mutant PSEN1dE9 is constitutively active
(Thinakaran et al., 1996). It has been reported that
Notch expression is upregulated in brains of AD patients
(Berezovska et al., 1998; Fischer et al., 2005). Further,
Davis et al. (1998) reported that both human WT and
AD mutant presenilin1 elevate Notch1 expression and
restore normal development in presenilin1-KO mouse.
It is therefore possible that the presenilin1 mutation
expressed in the Tg(APPswe,PSEN1dE9) mouse model
of AD may be responsible for the enhanced Notch cleav-
ages and increased NICD level for NSC proliferation.
EGFR signaling plays central roles in cell proliferation
differentiation and neuronal development, and it is
known that NSCs express EGFR (Reynolds et al.,
1992; Reynolds and Weiss, 1992; Craig et al., 1996;
Kornblum et al., 2000; Ramalho-Santos et al., 2002). It
has been reported that mice lacking either EGFR or its

brain enriched ligand heparin binding EGF-like growth
factor (Hb-EGF) die at birth, and the survival strains die
by postnatal day 20 to 25 (P20­P25) with severe neurog-
degeneration (Miettinen et al., 1995; Sibilia and Wagner,
1995; Threadgill et al., 1995; Iwamoto et al., 2003).
Recently, the expression of EGFR was reported to be
positively regulated by presenilin1, specifically in neural
cells, and presenilin1-knockdown NSCs had reduced
EGFR expression, resulting in decreased NSC prolifer-
ation (Gadadhar et al., 2011; Bruban et al., 2015).
Therefore, it is possible that the presenilin1 constitutive
active mutant (PSEN1dE9) enhances EGFR expression
on AD NSCs, as shown in the current study (Figure 2(b)).
In postmortem AD-patient brain, however, it has been
reported that intense EGFR expression was detected at
the periphery of plaque formations in the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus (Birecree et al., 1988). Thus, it can be
considered that EGFR modulates NSC functions in AD
brain under physiological and pathophysiological
conditions.
Although adult neurogenesis is gradually diminished
with the onset of aging in mice, a significant number of
NSCs still exists in aged brains (Jin et al., 2003). Not
surprisingly, the EGFR expression in rodent brain is
also reduced with aging (Hiramatsu et al., 1988). Jin
et al. reported that bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled
cells were reduced by 90% in dentate gyrus (DG) and
50% in SVZ of 20-month-old mice compared with 3-
month-old mice. Infusions of Hb-EGF restored and
increased the number of BrdU þ cells by 450% in DG
and 250% in SVZ of 20-month-old mice (Jin et al.,
2003). It is considered that Hb-EGF can activate
EGFR and induce NSC proliferation via the EGFR sig-
naling pathway (Higashiyama et al., 1991; Kornblum
et al., 1999). Recently, Hb-EGF is also reported to be
required for maintaining synaptic plasticity and
memory function in adult mice (Oyagi et al., 2011).
These studies reinforce the notion that EGFR signaling
pathway is crucial in maintaining adult NSCs and in
retarding the aging process of the brain.
Recently, we presented evidence that GD3, which is
the major ganglioside in NSCs (Nakatani et al., 2010),
was required for maintaining the self-renewal ability of
mouse NSCs in vivo and in vitro (Wang and Yu, 2013;
Wang et al., 2014). In the absence of GD3, NSCs from
postnatal ST-II-KO mice had even lower self-renewal
capacity than NSCs from embryonic ST-II-KO mice.
Figure 4. EGF signaling is required for cell proliferation of AD
NSCs, and gangliosides are necessary for Ab-stimulated NSC
proliferation. (a) NSCs were isolated from brains of AD mice and
their WT littermates. NSCs were cultured for 3 days with FGF2
but without EGF, and the number of NSCs was estimated by the
WST-8 assay. The y axis represents the relative absorbance (Abs.),
which indicates the percentage of absorbance against WT. Each bar
represents mean Æ SD of 12 independent experiments (n ¼ 12).
Comparison was made between AD mice versus their WT litter-
mates. No statistical significance was detected on the number of
NSCs in this condition (ÀEGF, þFGF2). (b) NSCs were isolated
from ST-II (GD3 synthase)-KO mice and their WT littermates.
NSCs were cultured for 3 days with or without Abs. The number
of NSCs in the monolayer culture in the presence of soluble Ab1-
42 (10 mM) was estimated by the WST-8 assay. The y axis represents
relative absorbance (Abs.), which represents the percentage of
absorbance against vehicle treatment. Each bar represents
mean Æ SD of eight independent experiments (n ¼ 8). *p <.05 and
**p <.01 indicate the level of significance.

Our previous in vivo study also showed that the ventricu-
lar wall was significantly thinner in adult ST-II-KO
mouse brain, and there was a progressive loss of NSCs
in DG (80%) and SVZ (70%) regions of 6-month-old ST-
II-KO mouse brains. In addition, the greater impaired
neurogenesis in the adult ST-II-KO mice led to depres-
sion-like behaviors in adult animals (Wang et al., 2014).
For maintenance of healthy NSC functions, our previous
study suggested that GD3 has important roles to keep cell
surface EGFR expression by modulating the EGFR
intracellular recycling pathway (Wang and Yu, 2013).
The expression of EGFR mRNA was not changed
(Figure 2(a)), whereas the protein level of EGFR was
highly elevated (Figure 2(b)) in AD NSCs. Taken
together, gangliosides may enhance the sorting of
EGFR through the early endosomes to the recycling
endosomal pathway, rather than through the degradative
lysosomal pathway in AD NSCs. The present study dem-
onstrates that b-/c-series gangliosides and EGF-signaling
are both necessary for Ab-stimulated NSC proliferation
(Figure 4(b)). Accordingly, gangliosides, which are
important modulator(s) of EGFR signaling pathway,
may maintain adult NSC functions. Further studies are
needed to examine whether the EGFR recycling pathway
is similarly involved in enhancing NSC proliferation in
AD brain.
It has been reported that endogenous neurogenesis is
altered in AD patients and transgenic AD mouse models.
Recently, stage-specific changes in neurogenesis were stu-
died in AD patients' brains (Ekonomou et al., 2015). In
that study, it was found that there was a trend showing an
increase in the number of neuroblasts (PCNAþ/HuC/
Dþ) in the DG of moderate AD brains, but eventually
a decrease in the number of immature neurons (HuC/
Dþ) in the DG of patients at the stage of severe AD
(Ekonomou et al., 2015). The majority of AD cases
(>95%) are sporadic, and only 5% of AD cases are
explained by genetic mutations (Alzheimer's
Association, 2014). Increased NSC proliferation is also
reported in sporadic AD mouse model (Diaz-Moreno
et al., 2013).
Regarding the aging process and AD, it is worth men-
tioning that a senescence-accelerated mouse prone
(SAMP8) model of accelerated senescence, which was ori-
ginally generated from AKR/J mice after selective breed-
ing (Takeda et al., 1981), has been proposed as a suitable
model to study changes associated with aging and AD
brains, given that SAMP8 mice develop AD lesions in
an age-dependent manner (Butterfield and Poon, 2005;
Morley et al., 2012). More recently, Di´az-Moreno et al.
reported that NSC cultures from 2-month-old SAMP8
mice displayed increased cell proliferation. On the other
hand, NSC proliferation was decreased at 10 months of
age in the SAMP8 mouse. In their in vivo study, the
number of BrdUþ proliferating cells was similar in
1-month-old mice, transiently elevated between
2 months (BrdUþ cells increased by almost 2-fold com-
pared with 1 month) and 6 months (about 1.4-fold
increased from 1 month) of ages in SAMP8 mice, and
finally decreased in older (14-month-old) SAMP8 mice
compared with control animals. GFAPþ/SOX2þ NSCs
were increased significantly at SVZ, and the thickness of
the ventricular wall was also significantly larger in
2-month-old SAMP8 mice than that in the control
strain (Diaz-Moreno et al., 2013).
In conclusion, the studies from AD patients and
mouse models clearly indicate an enhanced neurogenesis
in early/moderate stage of AD and then neurogenesis
becomes impaired in late/severe AD brains. In late/
severe AD brains, neurogenic impairments may underlie,
at least in part, the progressive loss of memory and com-
promised ability to learn and process new information
characterizing the disease. Both olfactory and hippocam-
pal dysfunction might be enhanced by compromised
neurogenesis in the SVZ and in the DG, respectively.
Therefore, endogenous neurogenesis has been suggested
as an important treatment target in AD (Mu and Gage,
2011). In our previous study, soluble form of Ab1-42 or
aggregated forms of Ab1-40 or Ab1-42 significantly
increased the number of adult NSCs as well as embryonic
NSCs (Itokazu et al., 2013; Itokazu and Yu, 2014).
Although other determinants (e.g., APP intracellular
domain, soluble APP beta, or presenilin) that are ger-
mane to Abs may also contribute to enhancement of
cell proliferation, our present study provides a novel
mechanism for NSC proliferation in AD brain that is
tightly regulated by gangliosides. Ganglioside expression
profiles are associated not only with central nervous
system development but also with the pathogenic mech-
anisms of central nervous system diseases, such as AD.
Understanding the roles of gangliosides and Abs on NSC
functions should be very useful in providing novel strate-
gies for promoting adult neurogenesis in AD damaged
brains.
