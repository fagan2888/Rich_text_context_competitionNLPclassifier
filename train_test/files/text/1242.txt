Osteoporotic Fractures
ABSTRACT: The new U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation Clinician's Guide to Prevention and Treat-
ment of Osteoporosis includes criteria for recommending pharmacologic treatment based on history of hip or
vertebral fracture, femoral neck (FN), or spine BMD T-scores 22.5 and presence of low bone mass at the
FN or spine plus a 10-yr risk of hip fracture 3% or of major osteoporotic fracture 20%. The proportion of
women who would be recommended for treatment by these guidelines is not known. We applied the NOF
criteria for treatment to women participating in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF). To determine
how the SOF population differs from the general U.S. population of white women 65 yr of age, we
compared women in SOF with women who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) III on criteria included in the NOF treatment guidelines that were common to both
cohorts. Compared with NHANES III, women in SOF had higher FN BMD and were younger. Application
of NOF guidelines to SOF data estimated that at least 72% of U.S. white women 65 yr of age and 93% of
those 75 yr of age would be recommended for drug treatment. Application of the new NOF Guidelines
would result in recommending a very large proportion of white women in the United States for pharmaco-
logic treatment of osteoporosis.

INTRODUCTION
THE U.S. National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)
recently released new guidelines, ``Clinician's Guide
to Prevention and Treatment of Osteoporosis,'' that in-
clude comprehensive, useful, and thoughtful information
about how to prevent fractures and mitigate their conse-
quences.(1) The guidelines include recommendations about
pharmacologic treatment to prevent fractures (Table 1).
They recommend treatment based on history of hip or
vertebral fracture, hip and spine BMD T-scores, and--
among those with low bone mass--a prior fracture or a
10-yr risk of fracture estimated from the World Health
Organization (WHO) risk index (FRAX).(2)
Two approaches to treatment may be considered: one
based on BMD alone and the other based on absolute
fracture risk of fracture. Given that one half of all fractures
occur in women without WHO BMD defined osteoporosis,
treatment that is initiated based on BMD alone will not
treat a large proportion of women who eventually go on to
fracture.(3,4) In general, compared with treatment based on
BMD alone, the emphasis on treating based on absolute
risk of fracture will decrease the proportion of 50- to 60-
yr-old women who are treated with drugs because they
have a low risk of fractures. On the other hand, this ap-
proach may result in treating a large proportion of older
people, particularly older white women who have higher
absolute risk of fracture. However, regardless of ethnicity,
increasing age is associated with increased fracture risk.(5)
The proportions of various age groups that would be

Therefore, we used data from the Study of Osteoporotic
Fractures (SOF) and applied the new NOF treatment
guidelines to estimate the proportion of white women :
65 yr of age who would be recommended for pharmaco-
logic treatment. SOF is a community-based sample of
women from four urban areas. To confirm how well SOF
represents the U.S. white female population 65 yr of age,
we compared the SOF population to white females 65 yr
of age who participated in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) on treat-
ment criteria listed in the NOF guidelines (including
FRAX) common to both cohorts. This was done to gauge
the similarities of the two cohorts on treatment criteria and
to confirm the accuracy of the proportion that would be
recommended for treatment in the U.S. white female
population compared with SOF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We used data from the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures
(SOF), a prospective study of community-dwelling white
women 65 yr of age recruited from four communities in
the United States: Baltimore, MD; Minneapolis, MN;
Portland, OR; and Monongahela Valley near Pittsburgh,
PA. Participants were recruited from population-based
listings and mass mailings between 1986 and 1987.(6) SOF
was initiated before widespread publicity about osteopo-
rosis and women were not recruited on the basis of any risk
factors for osteoporosis. All participants provided in-
formed consent. This study was approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board at each of the participating sites.
Demographic, anthropometric, lifestyle,
and medical history
Baseline examinations took place from 1986 to 1988 (n =
9704). Women provided information regarding fracture
history, smoking status, alcohol consumption, parental hip
fracture history, rheumatoid arthritis, and corticosteroid
use.
Height was measured with a wall-mounted Harpenden
stadiometer (Holtain, DyFed, UK). Weight was measured
with a balance beam scale. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared.
BMD
BMD was obtained between 1988 and 1990 (visit 2) at
the proximal femur and lumbar spine by DXA using QDR
1000 densitometers (Hologic, Bedford, MA, USA). This
was performed on 7959 of the 9451 (84%) surviving cohort
(hip BMD by DXA was not available at baseline). T-scores
for the femoral neck (FN), and total hip were calculated
based on the means and SDs obtained from the NHANES
III.(7) T-scores for the spine were calculated using the
reference value provided by the manufacturer (Hologic).
WHO 10-yr absolute fracture risk
The WHO 10-yr absolute risk of both hip fracture and
major osteoporotic fracture (hip, clinical spine, forearm, or
shoulder) was calculated by the WHO Collaborating
Center for Metabolic Bone Disease. Calculation of abso-
lute risk was done following the FRAX algorithm.(2,8)
FRAX is described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, the calcu-
lation of the 10-yr probabilities is based on nine risk factors
(age, sex, BMI, previous history of fracture, parental his-
tory of hip fracture, current smoking, use of corticosteroids
in past 3 mo, presence of rheumatoid arthritis, and three or
more alcoholic beverages per day). The 10-yr probabilities
for both hip and major osteoporotic fracture can be cal-
culated with or without FN BMD. The NOF treatment
guidelines use the 10-yr absolute risks (hip and major os-
teoporotic fracture) calculated using FN BMD.
NHANES III
NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the
health and nutritional status of adults and children in the
United States. The survey uses a stratified complex sam-
pling strategy to identify and examine a nationally repre-
sentative sample of ;5000 persons each year. We used data
from white women 65 yr of age who participated in
NHANES III. A direct estimation of the proportion of
white women 65 yr of age who would be recommended
for treatment under the NOF guidelines cannot be per-
formed using NHANES III because lumbar spine BMD,
paternal history of fracture, and personal history of frac-
ture at skeletal sites other than the hip, spine, and wrist
were not assessed in NHANES III. For those factors in
FRAX and/or the NOF guidelines that were measured in
both SOF and NHANES III, we reported the mean values
for continuous variables (age, BMI, and BMD) and pro-
portions for dichotomous variables (personal history of
fracture, maternal history of fracture, rheumatoid arthritis,
current smoking, and consumption of 3 alcoholic drinks/
d). NHANES III data were obtained from the publicly
available data release (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm). Means and proportions were adjusted for the
NHANES III sampling strategy as recommended in the
NHANES analysis guidelines using the SURVEYMEANS
and SURVEYFREQ procedures in SAS (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA).
Analysis
Women in SOF were excluded from the analysis if they
had missing data for any of the factors required to apply the
TABLE 1. CRITERIA FOR RECOMMENDING PHARMACOLOGIC
TREATMENT FROM THE U.S. NOF GUIDELINES

Low bone mass (osteopenia), T-scores 21.0 to 22.5 at the
femoral neck or lumbar spine and any of the following

NOF guidelines, including those required to calculate
FRAX. We applied the NOF guidelines as given in Table
1 to determine the proportion of women who would be
recommended for treatment.
Radiographic vertebral fracture status was available in
SOF. However, this information is not routinely collected
in the usual care setting and therefore, to conservatively
apply the guidelines, we did not include information about
radiographic vertebral fractures in determining whether a
woman should be treated.
In the primary analysis, the criterion ``past history of hip
fracture or clinical or radiographic vertebral fracture'' was
conservatively limited to past history of hip fracture. We
also estimated the proportion of women who would be
recommended for treatment if a history of clinical verte-
bral fractures was included. We also applied the criterion
``T-score 22.5 at femoral neck or spine'' and ``osteopenia
and 10-yr risk of hip fracture 3% or osteopenia and major
osteoporotic fracture 20%'' alone. Finally, to determine
if the proportion of women who would be recommended
for treatment differed by age, we analyzed women 65 and
75 yr.
RESULTS
A total of 9704 women participated in the baseline ex-
amination. Between baseline and visit 2, 253 women died,
39 were terminated, 72 did not return for visit 2 but were
monitored for fracture outcomes through postcard, and
1 was lost to follow-up. Among the 9339 women who
returned for visit 2 (when DXA measurements of the hip
and spine were completed), 7778 had complete BMD data
available at the hip and spine. Among those with complete
BMD data, 1682 were missing data for at least one criterion
in FRAX or the NOF guidelines--most commonly pater-
nal history of hip fracture. Thus, 6096 women were in-
cluded in the analysis. Women who were missing at least
one FRAX or NOF criteria had similar age, BMI, and
femoral neck BMD.
Women in SOF were younger (71 versus 74 yr) and had
slightly higher BMD at the femoral neck and total hip
compared with NHANES III. Therefore, women in SOF
had a lower prevalence of T-scores below 22.5 and a
higher number with T-scores >21.0. Fewer women in SOF
reported a previous hip fracture compared with the women
in NHANES (11.4% versus 13.8%). However, a greater
proportion of women in SOF 75 yr of age reported a
history of previous wrist fracture compared with the
woman in NHANES III (15.2 versus 10.1; Table 2).
Overall, applying the modified NOF guidelines to
women 65 yr of age, 71.8% would be recommended for
treatment (Table 3). When history of clinical vertebral
fracture is included, 72.5% of women would be recom-
mended for treatment. When the guidelines are applied to
women 75 yr of age, 93% of women would be recom-
mended for treatment.
Applying only the criterion of ``T-score 22.5 at fem-
oral neck or spine'' would recommend 40.4% of women for
drug treatment (Table 3). However, if T-score 22.5 is
limited to only the femoral neck, 20.7% would be recom-
mended for treatment (Table 3). Applying only the crite-
rion, ``low bone mass and 10-yr risk of hip fracture 3% or
major osteoporotic fracture 20%'' would recommend
51.5% of women for drug treatment.
DISCUSSION
We estimate that the new NOF guidelines would rec-
ommend that pharmacologic treatment should be initiated
for about three quarters of the participants in the SOF
study and >90% of women >75 yr of age. These figures
underestimate the proportions that would be recom-
mended for treatment in the U.S. population because
women in SOF had somewhat higher BMD values and
were somewhat younger than the women in the U.S. pop-
ulation-based NHANES III survey. Furthermore, we did
not include some criteria for treatment, such as a history or
presence of a radiographic vertebral fracture--inclusion of
this would further increase the number recommended for
treatment. Our estimates are consistent with results from
the Canadian Multicenter Osteoporosis Study that found
that over two thirds of white women 65 yr of age would
have a 10-yr probability of fracture 20% based on BMD
and the risk factors used in the WHO model.(9) Although
the NOF cost-effectiveness analysis did not report the
proportion of women who would be treated under the NOF
guidelines, they do conclude that pharmacologic treatment
would be cost-effective for the average 68-yr-old white
woman.(10) Thus, given that the average age of women who
participated in SOF was 71 yr, it is consistent that we es-
timated that a high proportion (73%) of women would be
recommended for drug treatment.
Our analysis suggests that about one half of the older
white women recommended for pharmacologic treatment
under the new guidelines would be included because they
have low bone mass (osteopenia) at one of the two skeletal
sites and at least one risk factor: a 10-yr estimated proba-
bility of hip fracture 3% or 10-yr estimated probability of
major osteoporotic fracture 20%. When so many people,
and such a large proportion of older women, are recom-
mended for drug treatment, it is important that the as-
sumptions underlying the recommendations be based on
robust data. In particular, it is important that there be
strong evidence that all of those people would substantially
benefit from treatment. There have been few trials of the
efficacy of treatments in this group, and it is uncertain
whether treatment reduces the risk of nonvertebral frac-
tures in people with osteopenia and no vertebral frac-
ture.(11­13) A trial of clodronate in women 75 yr of age,
not selected for osteoporosis, found a 20% decreased risk
of clinical fractures.(14) On the other hand, the ``Clinical
Fracture Arm of FIT'' found no significant reduction in risk
of fracture in women with osteopenia (hip BMD T-scores >
22.5).(15) Moreover, in the risedronate hip study, no clear
fracture reduction benefit compared with placebo was
noted among women 80 yr of age who were selected on
the basis of risk factors and not BMD.(16) Even in the
Women's Health Initiative trial, it seemed that women with
femoral neck BMD T-score <22.5 had a greater reduction

in nonspine fractures (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.25­1.10) than
did women with T-score 22.5 (RR, 0.87%; 95% CI,
0.57­1.34, p for interaction = 0.15).(17)
We found that ;21% of women in SOF had osteoporosis
defined as a femoral neck BMD T-score 22.5. In the FIT
trial, alendronate decreased the risk of all clinical fractures
by 31% in this group.(15) Expanding treatment by including
women who had a spine BMD T-score 22.5 added an-
other 19% of white women. To date, all FDA-approved
agents are effective in reducing vertebral fractures, and this
effect does not seem to vary by BMD.
Our estimates have several limitations. SOF enrolled
participants in 1986­1988 and measured hip and spine
BMD in 1988­1990. The profile of risk factors and BMD in
U.S. white women may have changed; in particular, there
have been secular increases in weight. Our estimates were
based on the WHO model that includes femoral neck BMD
and BMI (which includes height and weight), a temporal

population increase in weight may be associated with an
increase in BMD over time. Thus, these population trends
in body size might be associated with a decrease in the
prevalence of osteoporosis. A second limitation of our
analysis is that SOF is a cohort of community-dwelling
volunteers and not a population-based sample. However,
characteristics of the SOF participants are similar to, or
healthier than, those of the population-based NHANES
III, and therefore may underestimate the proportion of
women who would be recommended for treatment. Third,
FRAX may underestimate the 10-yr probability of major
osteoporotic fracture among those who have a radio-
graphic vertebral fracture. We conservatively excluded X-
ray fractures when the FRAX 10-yr probabilities were
calculated by the WHO (i.e., X-ray based fractures were
not included as a ``history of previous fracture'' in the
FRAX calculations). Fourth, because this analysis from
SOF includes only white women 65 yr of age, this study is
not able to estimate the proportion of younger women and
men and women of other racial groups who would be
recommended for pharmacologic treatment. Presumably,
the proportion of people in these groups recommended for
treated will be substantially less than the estimates from
SOF because they have a lower risk of fracture and lower
prevalence of osteoporosis. Finally, our estimate of the pro-
portion of women who would be recommended for treat-
ment is based on FRAX estimates from WHO as of early
2008. If new FRAX estimates become available, the pro-
portion of women recommended for treatment may change.
We conclude that the new NOF guidelines for pharma-
cologic treatment for osteoporosis would recommend drug
therapy to at least three quarters of white women 65 yr of
age and 90% of those >75 yr. When such a large proportion
of older women are recommended to receive drug treat-
ment for osteoporosis, it is important that the assumptions
that underlie that analysis be based on robust evidence. A
trial of bisphosphonate therapy and/or other pharmaceu-
tical agents in women and men with just ``low bone mass''
would be informative.
