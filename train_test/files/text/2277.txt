The National Association of County and City Health
Officials (NACCHO), in collaboration with the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, conducted the sixth Na-
tional Profile of Local Health Departments study in
2010. NACCHO conducted prior Profile studies in
1989, 1992-1993, 1996-1997, 2005, and 2008. The Profile
studies collect information on local health department
(LHD) jurisdictions and infrastructure, including gov-
ernance, financing, leaders, workforce, and activities.
The Profile questionnaire is distributed to every US
LHD, defined for the purpose of this study as "an ad-
ministrative or service unit of local or state government
concerned with health and carrying some responsibil-
ity for the health of a jurisdiction smaller than the state."
The purpose of this article is to inform the public
health research community, practitioners, and policy-
makers about the availability and potential of the Pro-
file study as a rich source of data to support creation
of research evidence for practice and policymaking. To
provide a sense of kinds of information available from
the study, the article includes study results from the
2010 Profile on selected topics--LHD accreditation, ag-
ing of the workforce, emergency preparedness, and ac-
cess to health care.
 Uses of Data and Information From the

hensive picture of LHDs and allows for assessment
of changes over time. Up-to-date information about
LHDs is important to organizations like NACCHO,
which support and represent LHDs, and to public
health practitioners and policymakers at the state and
federal levels. Data and information from the Profile
study are used in many ways beyond serving as the
nation's surveillance system for LHDs. The LHDs use
the information to benchmark themselves nationally
and against LHDs that are similar to their own. As
one LHD leader said, "We can compare things like our
range of services with the national average and our ca-
pacity and funding. We continually compare ourselves
to other departments in our state, [to] other metro areas,
and to other large LHDs in the data set."
The Profile data are one of the most important and
frequently used data sets in the field of public health
systems and services research. The Profile studies' na-
tional reach, wide range of topics, and high response
rates (recent Profile has achieved response rates of 80%
or higher) contribute to the value of these data for re-
search. In addition, the inclusion of many questions in
multiple Profile questionnaires supports longitudinal
analyses. Since 2006, NACCHO has provided data from

the Profile studies for use in more than 130 different
studies. A university researcher said, "NACCHO data
have been our best source of national data on public
health organizations and service delivery issues. I use
the data for analysis and also as a sampling frame for
launching new primary data collection activities."
Profile data are used to educate others about LHDs
by both university faculty and public health practition-
ers. An LHD leader said, "I use the Profile for pub-
lic speaking. The data are real. [The data] tell a good
story and provide important information." In addition,
2 leading textbooks on public health practice use data
from the Profile to describe LHDs.
 Highlights From the 2010 Profile Study
The 2010 Profile study included 2656 LHDs and
achieved an overall response rate of 82%. In addition to
the core topics included in each Profile study, the 2010
questionnaire included modules (asked of nationally
representative stratified random samples of approxi-
mately 625 LHDs) with questions on quality improve-
ment, accreditation preparation, emergency prepared-
ness, information technology, practice-based research,
access to health care services, and public health and the
law. The paragraphs below summarize a few findings
from the 2010 Profile study.
LHD accreditation
The Public Health Accreditation Board launched a vol-
untary national accreditation program for state, local,
tribal, and territorial public health agencies in Septem-
ber 2011. Responses to questions in the 2010 Profile
about intent to seek voluntary national accreditation
suggest a high level of interest among LHDs in the
national accreditation program. Sixteen percent of re-
spondents strongly agreed and 34% agreed that their
LHD would seek national accreditation. Furthermore,
8% of LHDs strongly agreed and 21% agreed that their
LHD would seek national accreditation within the first
2 years of the program.
The Public Health Accreditation Board has estab-
lished certain prerequisites for LHDs that wish to apply
for national accreditation, including completing a com-
munity health assessment, community health improve-
ment plan, and agency-wide strategic plan within the
past 5 years. Data from the 2010 Profile study suggest
that only 20% of LHDs have met all 3 of these prerequi-
sites, and there is little difference in completion of the
3 prerequisites based on interest in seeking accredita-
tion. These findings suggest that, although a relatively
large number of LHDs are interested in seeking na-
tional accreditation, many of them have not completed
all of the assessment and planning activities required
for accreditation. These assessment and planning activ-
ities are time- and resource-intensive and require spe-
cific skill sets. Many LHDs, particularly those that have
experienced funding and staff reductions, may be chal-
lenged to marshal the resources required to complete
the accreditation prerequisites.
Aging of the LHD workforce
The aging of the US workforce is well documented.
Between 1977 and 2007, employment of workers aged
65 years and older increased 101%, compared with a
much smaller increase of 59% for total employment
(aged 16 years and older).1 Several Profile studies have
collected data on age of LHD top executives, and these
data confirm that their age distribution is shifting up-
ward. The median age of an LHD top executive in-
creased from 52 years in 2005 to 54 years in 2010.
Furthermore, the percentage of LHD top executives be-
tween ages 60 and 69 years increased from 13% in 2005
to 21% in 2010. The percentage of LHD top executives
younger than 50 years decreased over this period (37%
in 2005 to 32% in 2010).
The shift to an older age distribution of LHD top
executives means that a large wave of top executive re-
tirements may take place in the future. Changes in lead-
ership can present opportunities for positive change
but can be disruptive if individuals with appropriate
skills and experience are not available to take on the
newly vacated positions. Thoughtful succession plan-
ning and developing potential public health leaders
are key steps to ensuring that qualified individuals are
available to assume these leadership positions. Data
from the 2008 Profile study show that more than 60%
of LHD top executives reached their position through
either an internal promotion (40%) or through positions
at other LHDs (22%).2 This suggests that current LHD
staff members, such as middle managers, are impor-
tant targets for leadership development. In the current
economic climate, funds to support LHD staff train-
ing are limited, and many employees have taken on
additional responsibilities in response to staffing cuts.
This scarcity in both time and money presents great
challenges to workforce development at a critical time.
A wave of top executive retirements also has the po-
tential to accelerate the trends of shared resources (eg,
one top executive serving multiple LHDs) and agency
consolidation, especially in a time of budget cuts. In
several states where jurisdiction consolidation has oc-
curred during the past decade (eg, Connecticut, New
Jersey, Ohio), retirement of the top executive has been
cited as a factor that facilitated these "mergers." Shar-
ing the costly resource of a top executive, via either

shared services or agency consolidation, could be par-
ticularly beneficial for LHDs serving small populations.
Emergency preparedness
Although the Profile study is not intended to assess
LHDs' level of public health emergency preparedness
and response (EP), the Profile questionnaire includes
some items on EP-specific funding and staffing. The
median amount of LHD revenue for EP activities (from
all sources) reported in the 2010 Profile was $67 000 or
$2 per capita, a small proportion of overall LHD fund-
ing. (For reference, median LHD revenue per capita
from all sources was $44 based on 2010 Profile data.)
Federal funds passed through from state health agen-
cies are the most common funding source for LHD
preparedness activities. Eighty-four percent of LHDs
received preparedness funding from this source, and
59% of LHDs relied exclusively on federal funding
to carry out their preparedness activities. Data from
the 2010 Profile demonstrate that LHDs rely heavily
on both their own non-EP staff and volunteers to re-
spond to all-hazards events. On average, LHDs used
up to 70% of staff not otherwise dedicated to EP when
responding to the H1N1 influenza outbreak and 30%
of staff when responding to a natural disaster. Conse-
quently, staff cuts have reduced many LHDs' capacity
to respond to emergencies. Nearly all LHDs engage vol-
unteers for EP, most frequently from Medical Reserve
Corps units, Community Emergency Response Teams,
and the American Red Cross. The median number of
registered volunteers ranged from 278 per 100 000 peo-
ple for LHDs serving jurisdictions with populations of
less than 25 000 to 37 per 100 000 people for LHDs serv-
ing jurisdictions with populations of 500 000 or more.
The importance of LHDs' role in EP underscores the
need for a robust preparedness and response plan and
a trained workforce. Proper training of volunteers and
non-EP staff is important to ensure the quality of LHDs'
response to emergencies.
Access to health care services
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(PPACA) of 2010 has reinvigorated the health care de-
livery and policy focus on prevention and health pro-
motion rather than on sick care.3 This development will
likely increase LHDs' existing interest in disease pre-
vention through improved access to primary care in
their communities. By ensuring timely and affordable
access to primary care, LHDs can play a major role in
preventing unnecessary suffering, death, and hospital-
ization costs.
The Profile study results show that, although LHDs
are already involved in promoting access to care, their
role can be expanded. During the 12 months prior to
the 2010 survey, most LHDs actively promoted access
to medical, dental, and behavioral health care services
within their jurisdictions. Nearly two-thirds were in-
volved in assessing gaps in access to 1 or more health
care services. The same proportion implemented some
strategies to increase accessibility of services. Two in 3
LHDs also implemented strategies to target the health
care needs of underserved populations. Nearly half of
the LHDs directly provided clinical care services to ad-
dress the needs of underserved populations.
Improvement in public health capacity is one of the
central canons of the PPACA. The PPACA includes ini-
tiatives that focus on removing barriers to accessing
clinical preventative services and developing healthier
communities. The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention has already announced grants for state health
departments, large LHDs, and community-based or-
ganizations to improve health in their communities.3,4
The LHDs should prepare to seize these opportuni-
ties, which are intended to promote the goals that
are also central to their mission--creating healthier
communities.
 Accessing Profile Information and Data
Information from the Profile studies is available in
many formats, most of which can be accessed online at
www.naccho.org/profile. Reports that detail the Pro-
file studies' findings are available for all Profile studies
except the 1996 Profile. Additional products that exam-
ine some issues in greater detail (eg, LHD workforce)
are available for the more recent Profile studies. Many
figures from the 2008 and 2010 Profile main reports
are available as graphic images and PowerPoint slides,
respectively, allowing users to incorporate the figures
into their own presentations or reports. The Profile Web
site also includes resources for researchers who wish to
use the Profile data files, including copies of the in-
struments for each Profile study, codebooks, and an
application form for obtaining Profile data. NACCHO
has developed geographic information system shape-
files for LHDs in the Profile study population, which
facilitates research that involves linking infrastructure
data from the Profile with other kinds of data, such as
indicators of community health status.
NACCHO will soon launch Profile-IQ, a Web-
based data query system (available at www.naccho
.org/profile) that allows users to generate selected
statistics (in table, graph, or map format) on LHD fi-
nances, workforce, and activities (currently includes
data from 2010 Profile only). Profile-IQ allows users to
select variables, measures, subgroups for comparison,
and subsets of LHDs to produce summary statistics

about these topics. The NACCHO hopes that Profile-
IQ will make accessing and using Profile data easier for
practitioners, policymakers, students, and others.
