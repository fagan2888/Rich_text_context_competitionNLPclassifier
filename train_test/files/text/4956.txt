Abstract: Composite measures of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of skeletal features are
commonly used to estimate developmental instability (DI), the imprecise expression of
developmental design due to perturbations during an individual's growth and maturation.
Though many studies have detailed important behavioral correlates of FA, very little is
known about its possible neuroanatomical correlates. In this study we obtained structural
brain MRI scans from 20 adults and utilized voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify
specific regions linked to FA. Greater FA predicted greater whole brain white matter
volume, and a trend in the same direction was noted for whole brain gray matter volume.
Greater FA was associated with significantly greater gray and white matter volumes in
discrete brain regions, most prominently in the frontal lobes and in the right cerebral
hemisphere. Developmental studies are needed to identify when FA-related brain
differences emerge and to elucidate the specific neurobiological mechanisms leading to
these differences.

Introduction
Developmental instability (DI) refers to an organism's ability to develop the
appropriate species-specific phenotype despite genetic and environmental perturbations that
tend to disrupt development, such as mutations, interbreeding, toxins, parasites, injuries,
and starvation (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1999; Møller and Swaddle, 1997). DI is often
operationalized as fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a composite measure of an individual's
deviations from symmetry in traits that are symmetrical at the population level, without
regard to side (Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill, 2001). Interest in DI stems in part from
the wide range of studies demonstrating that humans with greater FA may show reduced
fecundity, health, social dominance, and mating success (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000;
Johnstone, 1995; Leung and Forbes, 1997; Thornhill and Møller, 1997; Zebrowitz, Hall,
Murphy, and Rhodes, 2002). However, there is substantial variability in the strengths of
associations across studies, and reasons for inconsistencies are poorly understood.
To date, greater FA has been reported in a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders
(e.g., Edgar et al., 2006; Yeo, Gangestad, and Thoma, 2007) and has also been linked in
humans with traits such as intelligence, jealousy, and physical violence (Kowner, 2001).
More specifically, individuals with greater FA have been reported to show relatively lower
general intellectual functioning (Bates, 2007; Furlow, Armijo-Prewitt, Gangestad, and
Thornhill, 1997; Luxen and Buunk, 2006; Prokosch, Yeo, and Miller, 2005; Thoma, Yeo,
Gangestad, Halgren, Sanchez, and Lewine, 2005; though see also Johnson, Segal, and
Bouchard, 2008) and to express more jealousy in mating situations (Brown and Moore,
2003). Furthermore, greater FA predicts fewer self-reported lifetime sexual partners
(Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill, 2001) and fewer episodes of physical violence
(Furlow, Gangestad, and Armijo-Prewitt, 1998).
Given these behavioral correlates, one would expect FA to vary systematically with
aspects of brain anatomy and/or physiology. Identifying specific neural correlates of FA
would facilitate our understanding of the mechanisms linking the genetic and
environmental determinants of FA with individual differences in behavior. To date, studies
linking neural variation with FA in humans are sparse. In general, FA appears to be
associated with atypical functional lateralization of the human brain (Thoma, Yeo,
Gangestad, Lewine, and Davis, 2000; Yeo, Gangestad, Thoma, Shaw, and Repa, 1997). In
addition, we previously reported a positive relationship between skeletal FA and a
composite measure of asymmetries of gray matter, white matter, and planum temporale
volumes (Thoma, Yeo, Gangestad, Lewine, and Davis, 2002; Thoma et al., 2005).
However, we did not find any significant relationships between measures of brain volumes
(total brain, gray matter, or white matter) and FA in either of these studies. Consistent with
these results, Furlow et al. (1997) found no relationship between head circumference and
FA. Further, although FA, gray matter, and total brain volumes individually predict
intellectual ability, we have found that these volumes as assessed from MRI scans do not
mediate the FA-intelligence relationship (Thoma et al., 2005). However, Bates (2007)
recently reported that skull size, which is correlated with brain volume, did mediate the
relationship between intelligence and FA.
In the current study, we examined the neuroanatomic correlates of FA using voxel-
based morphometry (VBM). In contrast to traditional region of interest (ROI) magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) analysis methods, which are spatially limited and labor-intensive,
Fluctuating asymmetry

VBM allows for a fully automated and objective assessment of variations in regional
cortical volume, on a whole-brain basis. Studies comparing VBM to manual ROI methods
have attested to the validity of the former technique, and have even highlighted the
complementarity of the two approaches (Good et al., 2002; Giuliani, Calhoun, Pearlson,
Francis, and Buchanan, 2005). As well as quantifying between-group differences in brain
volume, VBM has also been used to highlight the relationship between local changes in
cortical tissue and measures of cognitive performance (Haier, Jung, Yeo, Head, and Alkire,
2004), disease severity and heterogeneity (Koutsouleris, Gaser, Jager, et al., 2008), and
demographics (Smith, Chebrolu, Weckstein, Schmitt, and Markesbery, 2007). Here, we
employed VBM to explore the relationship between variations in regional cortical gray and
white matter volumes and measured of, in a sample of neurologically intact adults. VBM is
especially well suited for exploring the neural correlates of FA. The wide range of
behavioral associations of FA does not suggest the central importance of any single brain
region. Rather, numerous brain regions could possibly be related to FA, rendering the ROI
approach inadequate. In this study, we used VBM to investigate whether specific regions of
cortical gray matter and underlying white matter are correlated with FA.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Twenty normal participants (13 male, 7 female) were recruited through ads in the
local media. Participants were adults ranging in age from 26 to 62 (see Table 1); one
female and two male participants were left-handed. None had a history of head injury,
neurological disorder, or unstable medical illness. All participants were screened with the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders, Clinician Version (SCID-CV;
First, Spitzer, Gibbon, and Williams, 1996). Individuals with a history of alcohol or other
substance abuse in the three months preceding the study were excluded, as were individuals
who demonstrated any history of either marijuana or cocaine dependence.
FA Measurement
FA measures reflect deviation from perfect symmetry in bilateral features that,
across the relevant population, are typically symmetrical. Alternatively, directional
asymmetries (DA) occur in features for which a population of organisms shows a
consistent structural or functional bias for a particular side of the body. Examples of
directional asymmetry in humans include the placement of the heart and number of lobes in
the right versus the left lung. Skeletal FA was assessed in 20 participants using calipers
across the feet, ankles, elbows, wrists, and hands. The length and width of each ear and the
length of the first four fingers were also measured. Each of these measures was conducted
twice to increase reliability, and the mean of the two measurements was calculated and
used as the feature size for calculation of FA. Of the seven body parts measured, only hand
width was determined to be directionally asymmetric; it was excluded from the present
analyses. FA for individual traits was calculated by taking the absolute value of the
difference between left and right sides, divided by one-half times the sum of left plus right
sides {individual FA = |R-L| / [.5 x (R+L)]}. FA scores for the ten remaining measurements
were summed to derive a total FA score for each subject.
Image Acquisition
Fluctuating asymmetry

For each subject, high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MR images were acquired with a
1.5 T Picker Edge Imager at the VA Functional Neuroimaging Center, using a Field Echo
3D Sagittal sequence (Picker) (TR = 15 ms, TE = 4.4 ms, FOV = 256 mm, flip angle = 25
degrees, matrix 192 x 256, slice thickness = 1.5 mm).
Voxel Based Morphometry
All image analysis was performed using and SPM2
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) running in MATLAB version 6.5. The fundamental
principles behind VBM have previously been introduced by Ashburner and Friston (2000).
First, MR images were manually aligned to a common space in SPM based on the locations
of the anterior and posterior commissures. VBM procedures followed the "optimized
VBM" protocol as described by Good et al. (2001), including creation of study-specific
gray and white matter templates. This involved spatially normalizing each study image to
the generic T1 template within SPM using an affine transformation and non-linear basis
functions, and segmenting the resulting images into gray matter, white matter, and csf
based on voxel intensity values and a priori information about brain tissue distribution. The
obtained normalization parameters were then recursively applied to the original images in
native space to achieve optimal normalization and segmentation. Optimally segmented gray
and white matter images were then averaged to obtain study-specific templates which were
smoothed via convolution with a Gaussian kernel of 8mm full width half-maximum
(FWHM).
To achieve optimal segmentation of the individual study images, the above
recursive procedure was performed where each image was initially segmented and
normalized to their respective gray or white matter template. Again, the normalization
parameters obtained from this segmentation and warping were applied to the original study-
images in native space, and the resulting optimally normalized images underwent final
segmentation into gray matter, white matter, and CSF. Next, the "modulation" step was
performed to correct for erroneous volume changes introduced during spatial
normalization. The resulting gray and white matter probability maps were then smoothed
with a kernel of 12 mm FWHM, giving the analysis a resolution of approximately 12mm
spatial scale for regions significantly associated with FA based on the Matched Filter
Theorem (Ashburner and Friston, 2001).
Statistical analyses were conducted using the multiple regression model in SPM2.
Individual FA values were the variable of interest, whereby FA scores were tested on a
voxel-by-voxel basis for significant positive or negative association with regional gray and
white matter volumes. Additionally, age, sex, and raw gray/white matter volumes were
treated as covariates of no interest (i.e., nuisance variables) in the analyses. For all
analyses, contrasts were defined to test for clusters of voxels of brain tissue that were
positively or negatively associated with FA. Clusters of voxels were considered significant
at p < 0.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons), and additionally thresholded for
display at using a minimum of 100 contiguous voxels. For each significant cluster, spatial
coordinates were entered into the xjView image viewing program
(http://people.hnl.bcm.tmc.edu/cuixu/xjView/) program to determine its approximate
anatomical locus (Cui, Jeter, Yang, Montague, and Eagleman, 2007). Importantly, as the
current study utilized a study-specific template and is hence in unique study-specific space,
Fluctuating asymmetry

the reported x, y, z coordinates and associated regions only approximate their
corresponding regions in Talairach space.
Results
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on age, FA, and tissue compartment volumes.
Partial correlations, controlling for age and sex, were obtained for relationships between
segmented overall tissue volumes and FA. We found a significant correlation between total
FA and white matter volume (r = .53, p = .025) and a trend toward a significant
relationship between FA and total gray matter volume (r = .43, p = .079). A total of eight
VBM analyses were performed. In the first four, VBM analyses examined positive and
negative relationships of FA with gray and white matter volumes, and age and sex were
treated as covariates. The second four analyses added another covariate, either total gray
matter volume for the gray matter analyses or total white matter volume for the white
matter analyses. As our results below suggest, treating total tissue volume as a covariate
reduces statistical power for detecting significantly increased or decreased regions related
to FA, yet serves to highlight those regions which are most strongly linked to FA.

Discussion
VBM analyses of gray and white matter revealed a number of regions
demonstrating that positively correlated with FA. In contrast, no gray matter regions and
very few white matter regions showed negative covariation with FA. Prior to discussing the
implications of these results, several methodological issues should be considered. First, in
two prior studies (Thoma et al., 2002; Thoma et al., 2005) with small samples using a
different, operator-defined segmentation analysis, we found no significant univariate
correlations between overall gray matter or white matter volumes and FA. In contrast, the
current study found a significant positive correlation between total white matter volume
and FA and a trend in the same direction for gray matter. Given that the current sample was
somewhat older and had slightly greater FA than our prior samples, these differences across
studies could reflect either methodological or sampling variance, or both. Second, FA
measures are known to be imperfectly related to the latent variable of interest,
developmental instability. A biometric analysis of FA (Gangestad, Bennett, and Thornhill,
2001) demonstrated that a composite measure, such as was used in the present study, has a
validity coefficient of approximately .68 (see also Prokosch, Yeo, and Miller, 2005). Thus,
the true magnitude of FA-brain relationships in the current sample is underestimated unless
one corrects for attenuation, which we have not done and replication of the current findings
is necessary in a larger sample.
Third, the current results must be understood within the context of the multiple
comparison issue. The growing VBM literature is characterized by diverse approaches to
correcting for multiple comparisons. The number of statistical comparisons made is not
actually the total number of voxels (1,844,677 in the current study), but rather the number
of "resels" (910 in the current study). Many investigators (e.g., Rotzer, Kutzian, Martin,
von Aster, Klaver, and Loenneker, 2008) have adopted a p < .001 criterion for each
individual cluster, foregoing any formal correction, and this criterion is most commonly
used in studies with relatively small samples such as ours. Others have simply used a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (e.g., Haier et al., 2004), though this
Fluctuating asymmetry

method adversely impacts statistical power. Given our reliance upon the less conservative
approach, the current results should be considered preliminary.
Our results indicate that gray and white matter regions linked with FA were not
randomly scattered throughout the cortex. Rather, significant clusters were more apt to be
found in the frontal lobes and in the right cerebral hemisphere. Thus, although the frontal
lobes comprise only about one third of total brain volume, 62% of gray matter voxels
described in Table 2 and 53% of the white matter voxels described in Table 3 were from
the frontal lobes. Similarly, 67% of these same gray matter voxels were in the right
hemisphere, as were 60% of the white matter voxels. Notably absent were any voxels from
the occipital lobes. Very few voxels were identified in left-hemisphere peri-sylvian regions
associated with language functioning. The regional specificity of these results demonstrates
the advantage of VBM over simple correlational analyses of total tissue compartment
volumes.
Why would FA be related to greater gray and white matter volumes? As distinct
maturational processes contribute to variation in volume at different ages, developmental
studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the observed neuroanatomic
variation. In general, gray matter volume increases during gestation and early childhood
and decreases during adolescence and early adulthood, whereas white matter volume tends
to show a linear increase over this time frame (Toga, Thompson, and Sowell, 2006).
Greater gray matter volume could reflect more robust early neurogenesis or less robust
developmental pruning. It is well established that early brain growth increases head
circumference; however, since FA is not associated with greater brain circumference
(Furlow et al., 1997), it appears that a reduced rate of pruning may be the more likely
process. Interestingly, recent data suggests that gray matter pruning may be under the
control of the innate immune system (Stevens et al., 2007), perhaps providing a link to
observations of greater rates of certain types of infection in individuals with higher FA
(e.g., Thornhill and Gangestad, 2006).
As mentioned above, FA has been previously linked with a variety of behavioral
traits in humans. Unfortunately, in this study we were not able to evaluate potential
relationships between anatomic variations and behavioral traits. The identified sites are
involved in distributed neural circuits underlying a diverse set of functions; moreover, they
likely comprise only one component of the total set of brain variables linked with FA, such
as atypical laterality (Yeo et al., 1997) and variation in neurometabolite concentrations
(Yeo, Hill, Campbell, Vigil, and Brooks, 2000). Nonetheless, the identified regions
represent possible substrates for FA-related behavioral variation. For example, one site
prominently linked with FA in our VBM analysis was the right dorsolateral frontal region.
Zaatari and Trivers (2007) reported that low FA individuals are less likely to make "fair"
offers in the ultimatum game. Right frontal fMRI activation occurs during performance of
this game (Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, and Cohen, 2003) and transcranial magnetic
stimulation of this same region, creating a "temporary lesion," specifically diminished
behaviors reflecting reciprocal fairness (Knoch, Pascual-Leone, Meyer, Treyer, and Fehr,
2006). Hence, gray and white matter variation in the right dorsolateral frontal region may
be related to behavioral variation linked with FA in the ultimatum game.
Further research is needed to better understand how developmental instability may
introduce variability into an otherwise "normal" course of brain development. The current
data demonstrate that FA is significantly related to variation in gray matter regions and the
Fluctuating asymmetry

white matter that connects them. Linking this cortical variability with individual differences
in behavioral and psychological factors remains to be done in a larger sample. Assessment
of these variables in a longitudinal developmental study would optimally address this issue.
Investigation of the role of FA in cortical variability in subjects with developmental
disorders may also further our understanding of the contribution of DI to abnormal
neurodevelopment and psychopathology.
