Abstract
Objectives
We examined the interactions between three dopamine gene alleles (DAT1, DRD2, DRD4)
previously associated with violent behavior and two components of the adolescent environ-
ment (exposure to violence, school social environment) to predict adulthood physical inti-
mate partner violence (IPV) perpetration among white men and women.
Methods
We used data from Wave IV of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health, a cohort study following individuals from adolescence to adulthood. Based on the
prior literature, we categorized participants as at risk for each of the three dopamine genes
using this coding scheme: two 10-R alleles for DAT1; at least one A-1 allele for DRD2; at
least one 7-R or 8-R allele for DRD4. Adolescent exposure to violence and school social
environment was measured in 1994 and 1995 when participants were in high school or mid-
dle school. Intimate partner violence perpetration was measured in 2008 when participants
were 24 to 32 years old. We used simple and multivariable logistic regression models,
including interactions of genes and the adolescent environments for the analysis.
Results
Presence of risk alleles was not independently associated with IPV perpetration but increas-
ing exposure to violence and disconnection from the school social environment was associ-
ated with physical IPV perpetration. The effects of these adolescent experiences on physical
IPV perpetration varied by dopamine risk allele status. Among individuals with non-risk dopa-
mine alleles, increased exposure to violence during adolescence and perception of discon-
nection from the school environment were significantly associated with increased odds of

physical IPV perpetration, but individuals with high risk alleles, overall, did not experience the
same increase.
Conclusion
Our results suggested the effects of adolescent environment on adulthood physical IPV per-
petration varied by genetic factors. This analysis did not find a direct link between risk alleles
and violence, but contributes to growing research indicating that if genetic factors contribute
to perpetration, this relationship is likely complicated and the result of interactions with other
factors.
Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as psychological, physical, or sexual abuse within the
context of a current or former romantic relationship, is a substantial threat to health and well-
being. Approximately one-in-three women and one-in-four men in the United States report
experiencing physical or sexual IPV.[1] Much of the IPV literature focuses on victimization
and the limited research on perpetrators, especially studies using longitudinal designs, has
hampered efforts to develop and implement effective interventions for IPV perpetration.[2­4]
Literature suggests the etiology of IPV perpetration is multifactorial.[3] Static antecedents,
stable characteristics that a relatively resistant to modification, are frequently studied as con-
tributors to IPV perpetration. A recent systematic review found that demographic characteris-
tics, including age, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, and marital status, and other static
antecedents, including mental health/illness and personality, are significant predictors of IPV
perpetration.[4] Distal antecedents, characteristics that are temporally removed from the time
of perpetration but may indirectly contribute to behavior, have also been evaluated as potential
contributors to IPV perpetration. Exposure to violence in the family of origin has been studied
extensively and has consistently been shown to be associated with increased risk for adulthood
IPV perpetration.[4, 5] Risky adolescent behaviors, including substance use and engaging with
deviant peers, has also been associated with adulthood IPV perpetration.[5] Proximal anteced-
ents, events or situations near the time of perpetration, may also contribute to IPV perpetra-
tion. Community factors, such as collective efficacy or social control, interpersonal factors,
such as relationship discord or deviant peers, and individual factors, such as substance abuse,
may also directly contribute to perpetration.[3, 4]
Multiple etiological frameworks have been developed to explain why IPV perpetration
occurs.[3, 6] However, the contributions of genetic factors have generally not been considered
in these frameworks, despite research supporting genetic contributions to other forms of
aggression.[7, 8] To our knowledge, three studies have examined genetic contributions to IPV
perpetration,[9­11] including only one that examined specific genes.[11] In that study, some
variants of the Monoamine Oxidase A gene and the serotonin transporter gene were associated
with increased odds of more frequent perpetration of IPV.[11] In light of the significant con-
tributions of gene by environment interactions to other forms of aggression perpetration, the
dearth of research on these interactions and IPV perpetration may be a significant limitation
to knowledge of the etiology of IPV. To address this gap in the literature, the purpose of this
analysis was to conduct a gene by environment analysis of three dopamine genes and two com-
ponents of the social environment during adolescence to predict physical IPV perpetration
among adults. Although genetic contributions are, at this point not modifiable, understanding

the interaction between genetic factors and distal antecedents to IPV perpetration may begin
to untangle the complex relationships between biological processes and environmental experi-
ences. This type of knowledge may inform the development of interventions focused on alter-
ing adolescent social environments.
Conceptual framework
This analysis is guided by the Catalyst Model of Aggression, which theorizes individuals
develop a behavioral predisposition to perpetrate violence as a result of interactions between
their early life experiences and genes.[12] As a result of this behavioral predisposition, individ-
uals engage in a range of typical behavioral responses when they encounter stressful situations.
[12] For this analysis, we focus on factors that contribute to the behavioral predisposition, spe-
cifically genes and adolescent experiences. Based on a comprehensive literature review, we
focus this analysis an exploration of three dopaminergic genes and their interactions with
exposure to violence and school social environment.
Genetic polymorphisms
Dopamine is a neurotransmitter with significant influence on motivation and learning.[13] Indi-
vidual processing of dopamine is influenced by dopaminergic polymorphisms,[14] defined as
variances in a gene or DNA sequence that occur relatively frequently in the general population.
[15] These polymorphisms vary from a change in one specific nucleotide base pair (single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms) to a pattern of repeating base pairs (variable number tandem repeats).[15]
The dopamine transport gene (DAT1) is a variable number tandem repeat gene.[16] There
are many different alleles, defined as the various forms of the gene, for the DAT1 gene.[16]
The 10-repeat allele is associated with an efficient re-uptake process, which reduces the
amount of available dopamine in the synapse.[14, 17] Research on the association between
DAT1 polymorphisms and violence perpetration suggests the 10-repeat allele is associated
with violent delinquency in adolescent men [13] and increased sensitivity to the environment
when homozygous (two 10-repeat alleles).[18]
Two dopamine receptor genes (DRD2, DRD4) have been evaluated as potential contribu-
tors to violence.[19] DRD2 contains a single nucleotide polymorphism [20] and encodes the
D2 subtype of dopamine receptors.[20] The A-1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated fewer
brain D2 dopamine receptors, which results in reduced receptor availability.[21] Carriers of at
least one A1-allele may have a heightened response to stressful situations [18] which may con-
tribute to the increased risk of violence perpetration.[13, 19] DRD4 contains a variable number
of tandem repeats [22] and influences D4 dopamine receptors.[19] Carrying at least one
7-repeat allele is associated with diminished response to dopamine,[23] a range of aggressive
behaviors,[19] and a differential response to the environment.[18]
Early exposure to violence
Although much of the literature on exposure to violence during youth focuses on child mal-
treatment and parental IPV, there is some evidence to suggest exposure to violence in the com-
munity may also contribute to risk for IPV perpetration.[4, 5, 24, 25] Men who report exposure
to violence in their neighborhood are more likely to perpetrate IPV compared with men who
report no exposure to violence in their neighborhood and women who report exposure to
neighborhood violence are more likely to be victims than their non-exposed peers.[24, 25]
Additionally, violence within the adolescent social network is a significant predictor of later IPV
perpetration.[24, 25] Young men from adolescent social networks with a high proportion of
members who engaged in violent fights had a much higher probability of perpetrating IPV

compared to men who had less violent social networks.[26] Additional research suggests that
youth exposed to higher level of delinquency in their social networks are more likely to perpe-
trate IPV as adults.[27] In contrast to these findings, some research suggests that only physical
childhood abuse and witnessing parental violence, not exposure to neighborhood violence, are
linked to adulthood IPV perpetration.[28]
School social environment
There has been limited investigation of the school social environment as a risk factor for adult-
hood IPV perpetration. However, improvements to the school social environment have reduced
violence on campus [29] and overall violence outside of school.[30] Students exposed to unsup-
portive school social environments, an overall measure of the quality of interactions between
students, their peers, and adults at school, are more likely to be victims and perpetrators of a
range of violent behaviors compared to students at schools with more positive social environ-
ments.[31, 32] School social environment may also have indirect effects on violence in early
adulthood as it may serve as a buffer between exposure to violence and violence perpetration
during early adulthood.[33] These findings are important to IPV prevention efforts because
adolescent violence perpetration is associated with an increased risk for IPV perpetration dur-
ing adulthood.[34] If school social environment is significantly associated with adulthood IPV
perpetration, interventions to help students feel safe and connected to social networks at school
may long-term impacts on IPV perpetration.
Study objective
Given the limited literature on the relationship of specific genetic polymorphisms to IPV per-
petration, and the inconsistent or unknown relationships between adolescent experiences and
IPV perpetration, the purpose of this analysis is to examine the role of dopamine genes, in
combination with adolescent environment, in adulthood IPV perpetration. Using a nation-
ally-representative prospective cohort study, we examine the probability of perpetrating IPV
during adulthood based on three dopamine genes and their interactions with exposure to com-
munity violence and school social environment.
Methods
Study population
Participants for this analysis were enrolled in The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
To Adult Health (Add Health). Within the initial sample, a subset of 20,745 adolescents in
grades seven through twelve was purposefully sampled to be representative of the US popula-
tion and participated in a prospective cohort study that surveyed participants in 1994­1995,
1996, 2001­2002, and 2008.[35] Systematic sampling methods and stratification were used to
ensure the selected schools were representative of the overall US school.[35] Of the 20,745 par-
ticipants enrolled in Wave I, a total of 15,701 participants (attrition rate: 24.3%) completed
data collection during Wave IV, when participants were ages 24 to 32 years.
To be eligible for this analysis, participants must have completed Wave IV data collection,
been in a relationship during the past twelve months, answered questions on the exposure,
interaction, and outcome variables, and completed genotyping. Participants who were not in a
relationship during the past twelve months were excluded because they reported on relation-
ship experiences that occurred more than twelve months prior to the interview and research
on survey methodologies has found that longer reporting periods are associated with underre-
porting and inaccuracy.[36] Approximately 3,320 (21.1%) participants were excluded because

they did not have a romantic partner in the prior twelve months. Approximately 600 (3%)
additional participants were excluded due to missing data for physical IPV perpetration, expo-
sure to violence, or school social environment. As directed by the Add Health research team,
participants who were excluded from the analysis were not removed from the dataset. Weights
for excluded participants were set to 0.000001, which allows for the correct weighting process
but does not include these participants in the estimates produced by the model.
This analysis was reviewed by The University of Iowa Institutional Review Board and
deemed "not human subjects research" and was not subject to further review.
Measures
Outcome. Physical intimate partner violence (IPV) perpetration was measured during
Wave IV data collection (2008­2009).[35] Participants were asked to report, "How often
(have/did) you (slapped/slap), hit, or (kicked/kick) [partner's initials]?".[35] Responses were
dichotomized and participants were coded as perpetrators if they reported slapping, hitting, or
kicking their partner at least once in the prior year.
Dopamine genes. The Add Health Study contained genetic data for all participants who con-
sented to the biological specimen portion of the study. Additional information on the protocol,
equipment, genotyping, and data cleaning for each gene was available elsewhere.[37] For this anal-
ysis, each dopaminergic polymorphism was categorized as associated with increased risk for vio-
lence ("risk allele") or not associated with increased risk based on prior literature of the functional
differences in alleles and associations with violence [13, 18, 19]. We categorized participants as at
risk for each of the three dopamine genes using this coding scheme: two 10-R alleles for DAT1; at
least one A-1 allele for DRD2; at least one 7-R or 8-R allele for DRD4. Although alternate methods
of categorization of the genes were available, we chose to a priori categorization of the alleles due to
the strong evidence of the associations of these risk categorizations with other forms of violence.
Interacting variables. Two types of adolescent experiences were included as potential
modifiers of the relationships between dopaminergic polymorphisms and physical IPV perpe-
tration: exposure to violence and school social environment.
Adolescent exposure to violence was measured during Wave I data collection in 1994­
1995.[35] Participants reported how frequently they were exposed to the several different types
of violence (i.e., threatened with knife or gun, shot, stabbed, beaten up, saw someone shot/
stabbed, physical fight) in the twelve months prior to data collection [35]. Response options
were "Never," "Once," and "More than once.".[35] In our literature review, we did not find
guidance on the treatment of these questions so we modeled the scores in multiple ways and
selected the categorization based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) value.[38] For the
final categorization of the scale, we summed the number of types of violence experienced in
the year prior to Wave I data collection when participants were in middle or high school.
During Wave I, participants answered a series of five questions on their perceptions of the
school social environment.[35, 39] Responses to these questions were reported on a five-point,
Likert-scale ranging from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree".[35] In this analysis, school
social environment was the average score across the five questions. Scores ranged from 1
("Strongly Agree") to 5 ("Strongly Disagree"), where higher scores indicated a more negative
perception of the school social environment.[39] This scale had good internal consistency ( =
0.79) in the Add Health sample.[39]
Statistical analysis
We weighted and clustered the analysis by school and primary sampling unit to account for the
complex survey design of the Add Health study. As a nationally-representative weighted analysis,

the demographic characteristics of the sample were weighted to be similar to the demographic
characteristics of population of adolescents in the United States during the mid-1990s. The distri-
bution of polymorphisms and risk for physical IPV perpetration differed by race so we stratified
by race to avoid bias associated with race-specific patterns of polymorphisms. After stratifying by
race, the number of racial minority participants in each cell was too small to make meaningful
interpretations. We also examined the potential differing relationships between dopamine genes
and environmental exposure by gender and found no significant differences by gender.
We used bivariate analysis to estimate the distribution of exposure to violence, perceptions
of school social environment, and each of the dopaminergic polymorphisms by gender and
race. We conducted weighted, clustered simple logistic regression to determine if the dopami-
nergic polymorphisms, adolescent exposure to violence, or school social environment were
associated with physical IPV perpetration. We also conducted weighted, clustered logistic
regression including the main effect of dopaminergic polymorphisms and adolescent exposures,
and the interaction effect of the two factors were used to determine if adolescent experiences
moderated the relationship between dopamine polymorphisms and physical IPV perpetration.
We presented the results of the moderation analyses as the odds ratio comparing each category
(i.e., risk gene and high environmental exposure; risk gene and low environmental exposure;
and non-risk gene and high environmental exposure) with a common reference group (i.e.,
non-risk gene and low environmental exposure) and also compared high environmental expo-
sure to low environmental exposure within each strata of genes. To allow for visual comparison
of these effects, we graphed the predicted probability for each of the combinations of risk.

form of violence, and 15% (95%CI:12.2­16.9) experience multiple forms of violence. For each
additional type of violence exposure during adolescence, the odds of perpetrating physical IPV
during adulthood increased by 41% (cOR:1.41, 95%CI:1.29­1.56).
On a scale where "1" indicated a strongly connected school environment, "3" indicated a
neutral option about the school environment, and "5" indicated a strongly disconnected school
environment, the average score among participants was a 2.3 (95%CI:2.2­2.4) (Table 1). The
median score was 2.1 (95%CI:2.0­2.1), the 25th percentile was 1.8 (95%CI:1.7­1.9), and the 75th
percentile was 2.8 (95%CI:2.7­2.9). An increasingly disconnected perception of the school envi-
ronment (referent group = one-point smaller mean score) was significantly associated with
increased odds of physical IPV perpetration during adulthood (cOR:1.25; 95%CI:1.08­1.46).
More than half of participants (55.7%; 95%CI:53.9­57.5) were categorized as having homo-
geneous DAT1 risk alleles (Table 1). Approximately a third of participants had at least one
DRD2 risk allele (38.1%; 95%CI:36.7­39.5) or at least one DRD4 risk allele (37.0%; 95%
CI:35.8­38.3). None of the risk alleles were associated with significantly increased odds of
physical IPV perpetration during adulthood.
Interaction of polymorphisms and exposure to violence
Overall, higher exposure to violence during adolescence (referent group = exposed to one less
type of violence) was associated with significantly increased odds of physical IPV perpetration
among participants with no DAT1 or DRD4 risk alleles (Table 2). The relationship was similar,

although not statistically significant, among individuals with no DRD2 risk alleles. In contrast,
higher exposure to violence during adolescence was not associated with increased odds of
physical IPV perpetration among individuals with high risk alleles. DAT1, DRD2, and DRD4
risk alleles were not significantly associated with physical IPV perpetration in the absence of
exposure to violence. Graphical representation of the probability of perpetration visually clari-
fied these complex relationships (Fig 1). Among those with non-risk alleles, the probability of
perpetration tended to increase as the number of violence experiences increased. In contrast,
the probability of perpetration stayed relatively flat among those with risk alleles as exposure
to violence increased, which was supported by the lack of statistically significant differences in
the odds of perpetrating physical IPV among individuals with risk alleles and high exposure to
violence compared with individuals with risk alleles and low exposure to violence (Table 2).
Interaction of polymorphisms and school social environment
In general, individuals with very low perceived school connectedness tended to have increased
odds of perpetration physical IPV compared to individuals with very high school connected-
ness across levels of genetic risk (Table 2). However, among individuals with risk alleles for
DRD2 or DRD4, decreasing school connectedness was not significantly associated with physi-
cal IPV perpetration (Table 2: OR Within Strata). Based on graphical representation of the
probability of perpetration (Fig 2), individuals with high risk DRD2 or DRD4 risk alleles
appear to have a reduced response to school social environment. Individuals with DRD2 or
DRD4 risk alleles and low school connectedness did not have significantly increased odds of
physical IPV perpetration compared with individuals with DRD2 or DRD4 risk alleles and
high school connectedness (Table 2).
The relationship between DAT1 and school environment did not follow the same pattern
as DRD2 and DRD4 (Table 2). In comparing individuals with non-risk alleles, individuals

with low perceived school connectedness did not have significantly increased odds of physical
IPV perpetration, compared with individuals with high perceived school connectedness. In
contrast, among individuals with DAT1 risk alleles, low perceived school connectedness was
significantly associated with increased odds of physical IPV perpetration, compared with indi-
viduals with high perceived school connectedness. In general, probability of perpetration
among individuals with DAT1 risk alleles matched the probability of perpetration among indi-
viduals with DAT1 non-risk alleles to a greater extent than among analyses of DRD2 or DRD4
risk alleles (Fig 2).
Discussion
The purpose of this analysis was to examine the relationship of dopamine genes and physical
IPV perpetration, considering interactions with exposure to violence and perceived school
environment. The results of these analyses suggested the etiology of physical IPV perpetration
was complex and that, in some circumstances, dopamine polymorphisms were associated with
differing probability of physical IPV perpetration. However, DAT1, DRD2, and DRD4 poly-
morphisms were not directly associated with odds of physical IPV perpetration.
In the first study of genes and IPV perpetration, a composite risk score composed of poly-
morphisms of the Monoamine Oxidase A gene and the serotonin transporter gene was associ-
ated with increased odds of more frequent perpetration of IPV.[11] In contrast to that study,
our results suggested these dopamine polymorphisms did not directly contribute to the odds of
perpetrating physical IPV during adulthood, but rather some polymorphisms interacted with
environmental experiences (i.e., the effect of the polymorphism was different across different
experiences) to contribute to physical IPV perpetration. This finding was consistent with prior
findings on the potential contributions of these genes to overall aggression, which suggested that
an increasing number of risk alleles had differential effects on violence perpetration dependent

upon exposure to adverse environmental experiences [7]. However, previous findings on dopa-
mine genes and other forms of violence have suggested individuals with high risk dopamine
alleles tend to have an increased aggressive response to adverse environmental exposure.[7, 8] In
contrast, our study found, in general, no significant increase in physical IPV perpetration among
individuals with risk alleles and exposure to violence during adolescence or low perceived con-
nectedness at school. It is unclear why these relationships differ and additional research is neces-
sary to duplicate these findings among other samples. If replicated, these divergent findings may
suggest the etiology of IPV perpetration differs from other forms of aggression or that dopamine
processing plays a different role in IPV compared with other forms of violence and aggression.
As with all studies of the contribution of genetics to complex outcomes, it is important to con-
sider the limitations of this study. First, this study uses self-reported physical IPV perpetration,
which may not be the most reliable measure.[40] Second, this study is limited to a self-identified
white sample because small cell sizes prevented meaningful investigation of these relationships
among other groups. In addition, this type of gene by environment analysis is correlational,
based on probabilistic methods, and does not imply a cause-and-effect relationship. Although
these issues with gene by environment analyses are not necessarily limitations to the research
when correctly interpreted within this framework, the interpretation should not be determin-
istic.[11] Additionally, researchers and practitioners must be mindful of the ethical implications,
including the possibility of stigma associated with incorrect interpretation of the results. Finally,
this analysis is not able to account for epigenetic differences, which play an important role in
phenotypic plasticity resulting from the interaction between the genome and the environment.
Despite these limitations, our findings, combined with the results of current and future
studies of the genetic contributions to IPV, may have important implications for future
research and practice. Gene-environment studies may contribute to a more comprehensive
understanding of IPV perpetration and may further clarify the role of neurotransmitters. Ulti-
mately, it may be possible to develop pharmacological or behavioral intervention strategies
based upon constellations of genetic and environmental risk factors. However, additional
research is necessary to further clarify these relationships before this line of research will have
practical applications to intervention development and implementation.
