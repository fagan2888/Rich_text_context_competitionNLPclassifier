Abstract
We estimated lifetime prevalence of psychedelic use (lysergic acid
diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), mescaline, and peyote) by
age category using data from a 2010 US population survey of 57,873
individuals aged 12 years and older. There were approximately 32 million
lifetime psychedelic users in the US in 2010; including 17% of people aged 21
to 64 years (22% of males and 12% of females). Rate of lifetime psychedelic
use was greatest among people aged 30 to 34 (total 20%, including 26% of
males and 15% of females).

Introduction
The classical serotonergic psychedelics, LSD (lysergic acid dieth-
ylamide), psilocybin ("magic mushrooms"), and mescaline (peyote
and other cacti), have their main mechanism of action at the seroto-
nin 2A receptor (5-HT
2A
), produce similar, often indistinguishable
subjective effects, and elicit cross-tolerance1,2. The mechanisms of
action, subjective effects, and risk profile of the classical seroton-
ergic psychedelics distinguishes them from other drugs sometimes
also labeled "hallucinogens", such as entactogens, like methylen-
edioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) that act primarily
at serotonin transporters, or dissociative anesthetics, like phency-
clidine (PCP) or ketamine that act primarily at NMDA glutamate
receptors1.
Prevalence data on psychedelic use in the US is often reported for
LSD alone (ignoring psilocybin and mescaline), or for psychedelics
grouped together with PCP (popular in the 1970s), MDMA (popu-
lar since the 1990s), and/or other "hallucinogens" (some older esti-
mates of hallucinogen use even included cannabis, amphetamine,
and cocaine as hallucinogenic drugs), or for use among teenagers
but not adults. Here, we present estimated lifetime prevalence of
psychedelic use by age category using data from a large US popula-
tion survey.
Methods
We examined the estimated lifetime use of psychedelics by age
based on 2010 data of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH). Results are presented for males and females separately.
We counted participants as having any lifetime psychedelic use if
they reported ever using LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, or peyote.
The use of mescaline and peyote were combined into one category
because mescaline is the active substance of the peyote cactus, but
peyote use was also examined separately. Current age was only
available as a categorical variable. This study was exempt from
review by our Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics
because all data are available in the public domain without any
identification of personal information.
Data source
The annual NSDUH survey provides estimates of substance use and
mental health indicators from a randomly-selected sample repre-
sentative of the US civilian non-institutionalized population aged
12 and older. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) of the US Department of Health and
Human Services is responsible for the NSDUH study design and
methods of assessment. Trained interviewers met the randomly-
selected participants in their homes, and participants listened to
recorded questions via headphones and then entered their answers
directly into a computer, providing a highly confidential and stand-
ardized setting. The response rate was approximately 78%. In addi-
tion, approximately 10% of participants were excluded from the
public use data file, either because of excessive missing data on
drug use or because they were excluded at random in order to increase
anonymity. The total number of respondents in the public use file
was 57,873. Detailed information on the sampling and data collec-
tion methods, including interview instructions and questionnaires,
confidentiality and informed consent are available on the SAMHSA
website (http://oas.samhsa.gov/nsduh.htm).
Data analysis
Estimates were calculated using the online Survey Documenta-
tion Analysis from the Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research (http://dx.doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR32722.v3).
Calculations of estimated population percentages and extrapolated
total numbers of psychedelic users in the US took into account
the weights provided with the NSDUH public use data file. Vari-
ance estimates took into account the complex sample design of the
NSDUH survey using Taylor series linearization. Respondents
with missing data on psychedelic use (less than 1% of the respond-
ents) were assumed to have no use.
Results
An estimated 32 million (95% confidence interval (CI): 30 to
33 million) US residents in 2010 reported lifetime use of LSD
(23 million, 95% CI: 22 to 25 million), psilocybin (21 million, 95% CI:
20 to 22 million), mescaline (11 million, 95% CI: 10 to 12 million),
or peyote (6 million, 95% CI: 5 to 7 million).
Figure 1 shows the rate of lifetime psychedelic use in the US in
2010 by age category and gender. Lifetime rate of psychedelic use
among people aged 50 to 64 years (the "baby boomer" generation)
was similar to the rate among people aged 21 to 49 years. Among
people aged 21 to 64 years, 17%, (95% CI: 15% to 18%) reported
ever using LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline, including 22% (95% CI:
21% to 23%) of males and 12% (11% to 13%) of females. Preva-
lence of psychedelic use was low among people aged 65 and older
(total 1.3%, 95% CI: 0.8% to 2.1%). Rate of lifetime psychedelic
use was greatest among people aged 30 to 34 years (total 20%, 95%
CI: 18% to 22%), with 26% (95% CI: 23% to 29%) of males and
15% (95% CI: 13% to 17%) of females.
Discussion
Psychedelics continue to be widely used in the US. Common
reasons given for using psychedelics include curiosity, mystical
experiences, and introspection3. Rates of lifetime psychedelic use
are greater in males than in females. Overall rates of lifetime psy-
chedelic use are roughly the same among the "baby boomers" and
younger adults. However, psilocybin was more common among
younger adults, while LSD and mescaline or peyote were more
common among older adults. Use of psilocybin mushrooms has
increased since the 1970s in the US and worldwide, likely due
to dissemination of simple home cultivation techniques, instruc-
tions on finding wild mushrooms, and information about effects
and methods of psilocybin mushroom use4. This was a retrospec-
tive cross-sectional study. Self-reports of drug use behaviors could
be influenced by memory errors and under-reporting; however, a

This report is short and well written. It reports on lifetime incidence of use of various psychedelics.
Without knowing the frequency of use, however, these data do not indicate whether the use of
psychedelics is increasing.
I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard.

The paper is concise and well written and I have no major criticisms of the content of the article. The
authors have appropriately analysed the best available data on the question that they address namely,
what is the estimated life time use of various psychedelic drugs among US adults. They report analyses of
a large representative US household survey data on lifetime experience with various psychedelic drugs.
My issue is more with what the paper does not say.
What's missing from the paper is any indication of why the authors' question is worth posing:
1. Why do lifetime rates of psychedelic drug use among US adults matter?
2. Why did they only report lifetime use? Lifetime or ever use can overstate rates of use in the population.
I would bet that most psychedelic use is very limited e.g. once or twice during late adolescence and early
adulthood. This isn't clear from the lifetime data presented. Some data on frequency of use would make it
clearer if most psychedelic use is in fact limited and experimental rather than more persistent as occurs
with cannabis and MDMA.
3. Were any data collected on adverse events or experiences? If so, this could be briefly reported.

3. Were any data collected on adverse events or experiences? If so, this could be briefly reported.
4. It would be useful to provide a bit more data on the characteristic of psychedelic drug users other than
their age and sex. How are they characterised by SES, education, geographic areas of residence and
experience with other illicit drugs e.g. cannabis, MDMA and stimulants?
5. What if anything follows from the findings? Should we be concerned about this use or should we regard
psychedelic drug use as being of much lower public health concern than the use of other illicit drugs such
as cannabis, amphetamine type stimulants, cocaine and opioids?
I have read this submission. I believe that I have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that
it is of an acceptable scientific standard.
