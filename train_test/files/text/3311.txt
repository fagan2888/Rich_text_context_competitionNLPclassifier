Abstract
We present a listening grid for moral counseling, in which we pay particular attention, alongside the what, to how clients talk
about themselves: as if they were spectators; aware what this talking does to them; how they perceive what is good from the
past; and what they will strive for in the future. By this moral talk, clients discover a picture of the conviction that will enable
them to make a decision.

Introduction
In earlier publications, we have described moral counseling
as a form of discussion support in which the primary focus
is on issues (the what) raised by the client (De Groot &
Leget, 2011). The strength of this technique is that it allows
the client to consider the moral spectrum from different
angles, assisted by a listening grid in which values and
norms are interrelated, in order to arrive at a moral
conviction.
In this article, we present a modified listening grid, in
which we pay particular attention, alongside the what, to
how clients talk about themselves. Do they talk as if they
were spectators? Are they aware what this talking does to
them? And, in the light of that experience, how do they
perceive what is good from the past and what they will
strive for in the future? By focusing on both the what and
the how of this moral talk, clients discover a picture of the
conviction that will enable them to make a decision.
Moral Counseling: A Method in
Development
Moral counseling is defined as the professional support or
supervision of clients when making decisions of which the
outcome can be justified in moral terms, such as good, just
or wise. Together with the client, the moral counselor
examines what the moral problem is: does it involve a
choice or a dilemma, or is there an unavoidable necessity
to make a decision? This involves looking at what possible
decision fits the ``I'' that must be rediscovered. Moral coun-
seling can therefore definitely be recommended for clients
who feel they have to make a decision that does not accord
with their self-image 足 in short, if the decision to be taken
propels them into a crisis situation.
The authors have considerable experience supervising
clients faced with difficult healthcare choices: questions
about life and death (e.g. abortion, euthanasia, and stopping
treatment), questions about suitable intensive-care and
neonatal treatment, and questions about organ donation
(De Groot, 2016). But moral counseling can also be used
outside the healthcare sector, for clients concerned about
what is the moral course of action to take (prospective)
and whether, seen from the present moment, their actions
were the just ones (retrospective).
Our method is related to Carl Rogers' discussion style
(client-centered method) (Rogers & Dorfman, 1951;
Rogers, 1966). Rogers' primary focus is the counselor's
stance (realness, acceptance and respect, and empathic
understanding) (Rogers & Freiberg, 1969). What this
means for actual interventions by counselors became
clear to us when we began using William Stiles' taxonomy
(Stiles, 1992) to analyze those interventions. For the

discussion content, we used concepts from the work of
Paul Ricoeur (Ricoeur, 1992). With these concepts, the
focus was on the content of the client's statements, the
what. By reflecting on our courses and counseling practice,
we have gained new insights, which Hans Evers describes
elsewhere as contemplative listening. Using ideas from this
approach, we look at how clients talk about themselves.
Following Evers' example, we have chosen below to use
the terms ``contemplative listening in moral issues'', and
``auditor'' rather than ``counselor''.
Rogers and Stiles: From Tracking to Providing Space
Working in accordance with the method outlined, material
was collected in an open, associative interview (Maso &
Smaling, 1998), in which facts, emotions, attitudes and
convictions could be addressed. The principles of client-
centered therapy (the therapist's congruence or genuine-
ness, unconditional positive regard, a complete acceptance,
and a sensitively accurate empathic understanding) were
applied (Rogers, 1966). Initially, we found all interventions
effective provided they were of a ``tracking'' nature. We
started by using Stiles to analyze our discussions (Stiles,
1992). His definitions of the different interventions helped
us gain a better understanding of the process by which
people arrive at their convictions. Stiles also draws attention
to the intent of an intervention. For example, a question can
arise out of curiosity or judgment on the part of the auditor
(QQ) , but also from the client's need to check whether the
reflection provided is correct. In the first instance, the dis-
cussion agenda is taken over by the auditor, rather than giving
the client space to arrive at their own conviction. This led to
a different view of the desired interventions. ``Allowing
space'' became the key issue, rather than ``tracking''. We
opted for a radical application of the interview style that
Stiles describes as ``acquiescence''. Four interventions
(Edification, Confirmation, Acknowledgment, and
Reflection) demonstrate that the auditor is staying within
the client's frame of reference. Interventions such as
Disclosure, Advisement, Question, and Interpretation
should therefore be avoided. By being aware of their
responses, auditors can ensure that they really are leaving
the discussion agenda up to the client.
Ricoeur
Once the client has been given every opportunity to make
moral statements, the auditor and client will attempt to
establish a coherent link between the statements. For
this we used a listening grid with labels based on
Ricoeur's concepts (Ricoeur, 1992). The client and auditor
are guided primarily by what the client has said. Ricoeur
points out that when making a morally laden decision,
people may justify their decision based on what they
strive for in terms of values (ideal足teleological) or what
they see as the norm for themselves (commandment, pro-
hibition, and duty足deontological). For the first perspective,
he draws on the ideas of Aristotle, and for the second on
those of Kant. Ricoeur argues that both perspectives
should be interrelated. He employs the image of a sieve.
In order to come to a wise decision, Ricoeur explains,
people need to pass what they label as ``good'' through
the ``sieve'' of what they see as ``just''. ``Just'' is about uni-
versal norms, norms that apply to everyone in all situ-
ations. Ricoeur advocates wisdom in a practical situation,
a wisdom that is found by passing what you believe is
worthwhile through the sieve of what is generally regarded
as just.
Ricoeur also makes a distinction according to source of
viewpoint: whether something comes from the individual
themselves, from concern or respect for the (significant)
other, or from emotions or rules of justice that are widely
shared by society and all its institutions i.e. the anonymous
other or ``they''.
In our earliest publications (De Groot & Evers, 2007; De
Groot & Leget, 2011), we presented several abstract terms
that we took as labels from Ricoeur. Considerations that
people use in order to arrive at a decision can always be
traced back to one of these nine labels, which we have
arranged in a listening grid (see the nine squares in diagram,
Figure 1). In later publications (De Groot, 2008, 2011) we
used the image of the moral house: people have everything
``in-house'' to justify their morally laden decisions. Their
house accommodates values, norms and convictions
which have their source in themselves, in their relationship
with significant others or in social institutions that are just
(see moral house, Figure 2). When making a decision,
people intuitively open up some of the rooms. They will
often have a preference for a particular ``floor'' or ``story''
of their moral house. Thus, whereas one person will tend to
seek justification in certain values or ideals that they strive
for, another will legitimize his or her decision by appealing to
universal norms. Sometimes people will already have made a
deliberation and will therefore speak with determination
and conviction. In their discussion with the auditor, people
are invited to examine every room of their moral house in
order to see what they can contribute to their ultimate
decision. Sometimes clients are confronted with ``empty
rooms'' (e.g. no ideals of their own, or many norms), and
they may become aware of these gaps. This can prompt
Figure 1. Ricoeur's key concepts in regard to moral counselling.
de Groot and van Hoek 107
them to supplement their spontaneous moral pronounce-
ments. If clients feel that their moral considerations span the
entire moral spectrum, they may decide which consider-
ations weigh most heavily or which ones are in conflict.
This gives rise in their mind to a ``moral maps'', which
they can then use to find their way through what was initially
a bewildering tangle of thoughts and considerations.
Evers
The counseling discussion can be seen as an exchange of
statements in which the content of the statements is para-
mount. In training situations and in our contact with clients,
we have discovered that it is not only what clients say that
matters, but also how clients talk about themselves. Talking
can be viewed as the transmission of a message (content)
by a person who is, but it can also be seen as a form of
incarnation: a person becomes themselves while talking.
Talking is therefore an act of creation, the person is
engaged in self-realization. This calls for a particular kind
of listening in order to bring the speaker to this self-
realization. Hans Evers calls this ``contemplative listening'':
the auditor accompanies the client, who listens to them-
selves in order to seek a new self-understanding, a new
conviction (Evers, 2017).
This form of contemplative listening can be used in
moral counseling, which we have therefore renamed ``con-
templative listening in moral issues''. Whereas contempla-
tive listening can relate to an entire life, with moral issues it
is about the ``moral life'', what Ricoeur called the ``good
life''. In this article, we follow Ricoeur in speaking about the
``good life''. Clients give their opinions on the moral aspects
of what they must decide. The moral (which we understand
as a metaphor) is not something that can be encapsulated
in one go, but a ``picture of what is moral'' arises when
people talk about it from four different perspectives.
1. What is moral is revealed when people talk about their
lives as though they were spectators. They talk about a
range of facts with a moral dimension: the interests at
stake, the usefulness of a particular decision, or
effectiveness, efficiency and expediency. They survey
the interests and factors that determine their room
for maneuver because these are what conditions the
moral decision. We call this perspective ``overview''.
2. Talking involves not only an exchange of content, but
also perception. This perception leads to a form of
insight based on associations, emotions and behavior.
Their insight tells clients something about how they
relate to the act of speaking itself. They perceive that
they can only achieve a ``good life'' within certain
boundaries, by letting themselves be guided by certain
norms and duties. The locus of morality is in their cur-
rent emotions (Nussbaum, 2003).
How people talk about themselves is determined not
only by their spatial position in the present and their
current talk within that (overview, and insight). Gauging
the talk in the present vis-a
`-vis yesterday's and tomor-
row's talk also determines the how 足 in other words,
the temporal axis.
3. In seeking a ``good life'', a client can report that
value was always attached to a certain behavior in the
past (retrospective). Clients then say what they until
now have regarded as virtuous, as a good life. In the
light of the dilemma they face, this is no longer self-
evident.
4. Clients can also look ahead in time (prospective) and
say, from the perspective of the present, what pro-
spects there are of a good life in the future, as grounds
for hope. These are the ideals and values at stake for
them at that moment.
We find that this model, as an addition to Ricoeur,
does justice not only to teleological and deontological
viewpoints, but also to pragmatic and utilitarian consider-
ations. The emphasis is not on providing a justification vis-
a
`-vis the other, but on reorienting one's own conviction. It
is not about ``sifting'' or construing what is opportune
within the justification, but about ``discovering'' the link
that is already there. It is not about what is plausible, but
about what is appropriate and authentic, an individual's
deepest conviction.
To illustrate our assumption that it is always possible to
identify four perspectives in discourse, we cite several
statements from a woman faced with the choice of
whether or not to have an abortion. Her unborn child
was given a negative diagnosis at the prenatal examination.
The woman came to the auditor because she did not know
what decision to make: to have an abortion or go ahead
with the pregnancy and risk having a seriously disabled
child. She made the following statements:
. I have doubts about the self-evident nature of being a
mother (insight足perception)
Figure 2. Ricoeur's key concepts presented as a moral house.

. and I realize that I've always wanted children, without
reservation (retrospective足conferring meaning)
. and I think I'd be a good mother (prospective足ideal)
. I already have a son (overview足fact)
. and I also have to take him into account (insight足norm)
. I was brought up to believe that you have to accept life
as it comes (overview足fact)
. and that's why the idea of having an abortion makes me
feel sick (insight足perception/boundary).
. I think I have to be able to give my son all the time and
care he needs (insight足norm)
. My husband is opposed to us having this child (over-
view足interests).
Contemplative Listening in Moral Issues: Focus on the
How and What
In our earliest publications on supporting clients in making a
decision (De Groot & Leget, 2011), our focus was primarily
on what clients talked about in relation to their choice of a
good life. The schema that we derived from Ricoeur sug-
gests a form of hierarchy: the ``good life'' is paramount but is
corrected (using the analogy of the ``sieve'') through norma-
tive ethics to arrive at wisdom in a specific situation.
However, if we look at how people talk about themselves
and their picture of a good life, we see that this hierarchy is
absent. With our approach to a conviction based on four
perspectives, we have shown that the picture of the convic-
tion arises from these perspectives, which do not have a
hierarchical relationship to one another.
Clients who come to an auditor face a choice that has
caused them to feel confused. The solutions which, until
now, they have applied to such choices no longer suffice.
What they base their lives on and what they strive for as a
``good life'', as they call it, have come under pressure.
Yesterday's convictions no longer provide grounds for
today's action: there are all manner of interests, as well
as considerations of usefulness and necessity, which cause
the individual and their world to change irreversibly.
Clients feel that there are new boundaries to what is pos-
sible and to what they want. These limits trouble and con-
fuse them: they have lost their conviction.
The Process of Contemplative Listening in
Moral Issues
How can we support clients to make a choice or decision
that they will not regret in the near future? The answer is:
by supporting them in such a way that they arrive at a new
conviction. In these cases, the auditor should focus on four
elements. These are described using a case study, for which
we present several illustrative excerpts. To avoid confusion
in the description below, the male pronoun is used for the
auditor and the female pronoun for the client.
Providing Space
When an auditor notices that a client is facing a moral
dilemma, he can suggest contemplative listening in moral
issues. The client states what the moral problem is and
what decision she is intuitively inclining towards. She is
then invited to explore her ``moral map'' by stating all
the possible considerations that are relevant to her deci-
sion. The auditor maintains a low profile: he does not move
outside the client's frame of reference. The most common
and effective intervention here is ``Reflection'' (Stiles,
1992), whereby the auditor ``reflects'' back what the
client says. This usually takes the form of simply repeating,
or summarizing using the auditor's own words, what has
just been said (e.g. C3). The auditor can also reflect on the
discussion so far (a more complete summary, e.g. C4). This
gives the client the space to talk about everything that
occurs to her 足 in a more or less associative fashion 足
concerning what affects her most deeply.
``Acknowledgment'' is another suitable intervention. Small
verbal and non-verbal encouragements can help the client
to continue with her story (e.g. C2). During the discussion,
the auditor takes notes for his own benefit of what is said.
He may jot something down as a reminder of a particular
statement. He may also make an audio recording of the
discussion for later analysis.
A chaplain (C) observes during a multidisciplinary conversa-
tion that that there is dissatisfaction among the nursing staff.
Later, he asks Esther (E), the senior nurse, what is going on.
She explains that a staff member from the department has
been laid off because of cuts. Esther feels that it has not
been handled in a satisfactory manner and wonders whether
she should do something about it. She says it is not the first
time that an older employee has lost their job because of
cutbacks. The chaplain invites her (E) to come and discuss it
calmly at a later time.
C1: Esther, you told me what's bothering you.
E1: Yes, I have problems with how management is treat-
ing us. Staff here are simply discarded. Once again, an
older colleague who I had a lot to do with has been
sent packing. I don't think it's right, but I'm not doing
anything about it. Should I? That might make me the
focus of a lot of negative attention.
C2: [nods]
E2: She was put under pressure. She's worked here,
believe it or not, for 40 years! And now she's
simply been shoved out. I think it's appalling.
Should I just let it happen?
C3: You think it's appalling. (continued)
de Groot and van Hoek 109
All Perspectives
While exploring the moral map, the auditor should remem-
ber that the client can talk about herself from different
perspectives. He should take this into account in his reflec-
tions, for example, by reflecting back both fact and percep-
tion (body language) (e.g. C11). It is then up to the client
whether she addresses content (such as a factual matter)
or focuses more on how talking about the content makes
her feel. The auditor can also reflect two perspectives at
the same time (such as ideal and interests, e.g. C13).
Clients can change perspective very easily. By making
good reflections, the auditor seeks to encourage the
client to talk about considerations regarding her conviction
from more than one perspective. There is no need, how-
ever, for the client to utilize all perspectives before arriving
at a conviction. The client remains owner of the discussion
and determines how she uses the space that is offered 足
the auditor does not need to ``push and pull'' the client.
Clarifying and Classifying the Moral Statements
In contemplative listening the auditor briefly records all
relevant statements (facts, norms, virtues, and values) as
if he were the secretary during the internal consultation.
Once the topic has been examined from all sides and the
client is not making any new statements, the client and
auditor end the open discussion. The client has heard her-
self speak and has arrived at a new understanding of herself
and her moral problem. New insights often emerge while
speaking. The conviction or choice of direction may not yet
be clear, however. To help the client to classify the many 足
sometimes contradictory 足 statements, the auditor and
client look back at the statements that have been recorded.
They now agree on a new direction for the discussion:
once collected, the statements are formulated more spe-
cifically and then classified. The client is invited to formu-
late a statement she made during the discussion as a
personal position (e.g. C101足103). For statements that
are very general, the auditor encourages the client to
make them more personal (e.g. C150足152). In the formu-
lation, the auditor tries to pay attention not only to what is
being said, but also how (from what perspective) it is being
said. When the client says that a sentence truly reflects
what she meant to say, that statement is recorded.
E10: Hospital management thinks it's okay to get rid of
older people. But I think it's not okay. Treating
people like that is amoral.
C11: You say amoral and you make a clear gesture with
your arm.
E11: It makes me angry! If nobody says anything, they'll
just think that it's okay. It's not okay, it's appalling!
C12: It makes you angry, it's appalling.
E12: Deep down, I have to say something, but what will
happen to me if I do? I also have a family at home. But
I can't just sit back.
C13: Deep in your heart you want to say something, but
you've got a family too.
E13: Yes, we're breadwinners together, so I can't just lose
my job. And I worry that I'll be next in line if I say
something. It wouldn't be the first time.
Continued
E3: Yes, I do! That's no way to treat people! I ask myself
whether I should react if I see my employer doing
things that I find appalling.
C4: You have difficulty with the fact that a colleague who
has worked here for 40 years has been laid off. You
think it's appalling. You want to say something but
that would make you the focus of negative attention.
C101: Esther, you've made a number of statements.
We'll now write them down one by one. You
said at the end of the discussion: ``I want to be
a big girl and say something about it.'' Can you
elaborate on that?
E101: I think that I shouldn't be afraid. I don't want to be
so afraid for my own job that I no longer protect
the most vulnerable. Then I'd only be acting out
of self-interest.
C102: You don't want to act out of self-interest, but
instead stand up for the interests of others.
E102: Exactly. If everyone only thought of themselves,
that would be at the expense of the most vulner-
able. I don't want to be like that.
C103: So, I'll write down: ``I want to stand up for the
interests of the most vulnerable.'' And also: ``I
don't want to act out of self-interest.''
E103: Not purely out of self-interest, no.
. . .
C150: And this statement from the beginning: ``That's no
way to treat people.''
E150 What management is doing isn't just. You have to
treat people with respect, you can't just uncere-
moniously discard them.
C151 Discard
E151 If someone's given her all for your hospital for 40
years, I think you should thank them for all that
they've done and let them work in peace until
they retire. It's a question of respect and
appreciation.
C152 I'm writing down: ``I believe you should treat
people with respect and appreciation.''
110 Journal of Pastoral Care & Counseling 71(2)
Once the statements have been recorded, the auditor
asks the client to organize them by perspective. He asks
her, in language she understands, what the differences in
perspective are and how we can identify them as fact, norm
and duty, virtue or ideal and value. A ranking can be made
within the different perspectives: some values may be more
important than others, some norms may weigh more heav-
ily or be more binding than others, etc. Some things may
also remain ambivalent.
A further distinction can be made with all four perspec-
tives between what the client sees as coming from herself,
what arises out of concern or respect for the significant
other, or from the values and norms that she derives from
certain institutions.
However, Ricoeur's distinction between self, significant
other and anonymous other (``they'') can also be left out if
there is not enough time available for ample consideration.
In that case, the approach from four perspectives will suf-
fice. The client takes the lead in classifying the statements.
If she regards a particular statement as a norm or bottom
line for herself, the auditor must go along with that, even if,
based on his own frame of reference, he views the state-
ment more as a virtue or value.
The Client Decides
Once all statements have been identified, the auditor asks
finally: what do you see? If you cast your eye over all of this,
is there a picture (of the good life), a sentence or saying
that occurs to you? Here, the auditor asks about the ``pic-
ture'' of a new conviction.
To conclude the discussion, the auditor can ask how this
picture relates to the client's initial intuitions. Sometimes
the discussion prompts the client to modify her earlier
intuition or tie it to a different decision. For example, in
various cases involving pregnant women, we have heard:
``I'm opting for an abortion now, but I don't ever want to
be faced with this decision again.'' For one woman, this
meant deciding to never become pregnant again. For
another, it meant that she did not want to undergo prenatal
diagnostic testing during any subsequent pregnancy. In the
case study presented here, this exercise uses arguments to
reinforce the intuition articulated earlier, so that the client
is more confident about her decision.
Rounding Off the Discussion
The client goes home with a picture of a new conviction. It
is not necessarily clear as yet what decision she will tie it
to. The auditor has to curb his curiosity and not insist that
the client make a decision in his presence. It is usually
enough to express confidence in the client that she can
make the decision herself. The client makes the decision
with respect to herself. The auditor can only confirm that,
however the decision turns out, the client knows for her-
self that she arrived at it after careful consideration. That
knowledge may be comforting, even if the client later
regrets her decision. What gives comfort is the conviction
that she made a moral decision in that particular situation:
``Here I stand, I can't act in any other way''. The auditor does
not take leave of the client until he has once again assured
her that the privacy of this discussion will be respected
and that he will never call her to account for her decision.
He advises the client to go home and sleep on it for a night.
C201 Esther, the statement ``I want to stand up for the
interests of the weakest'' 足 is that something you
have to do, something you would like to do or is it
how you know yourself to be?
E202 Well, I definitely don't do it all the time, I try to do it
more often. I've sometimes spoken out in the past,
but it cost me dearly. So, it's something that I'd like to
do, but I don't have to.
C202 Is it your wish to act in such a way?
E202 Yes. So that goes on the right with the ideals?
C203 It's up to you where you put it. You can always move
it again.
E204 With the ideals, then.
C205 And how important is it to you?
E205 Very important. So, put in the middle.
C206 Here I've got: ``I'm a breadwinner, I have to keep my
job.'' Where would you put that?
E206 Well, I don't want to lose my job, otherwise I would
have said something long ago and looked for other
work. I have to keep this job in the interests of my
family. Isn't that a fact that I have to take into
account? Weren't interests at the top?
C207 And are they your own interests, those of a signifi-
cant other or of ``them''?
E207 My family, so in the middle square. And that's very
important, but also not so bad. As a mother, I'd
rather set a good example than be afraid to open
my mouth at work.
E301 Gosh, I thought I was doing the just thing by keeping
my mouth shut. But in fact, I've known for a long
time that I wanted to say something. It's just that I
was so scared about my job. But now I feel that I
simply can't ignore this injustice. Also, because other-
wise, management would simply keep treating us this
way. I can't keep going on acting as though nothing
has happened.

C13: Deep in your heart you want to say something, but
you've got a family too.
E13: Yes, we're breadwinners together, so I can't just lose my
job. And I worry that I'll be next in line if I say some-
thing. It wouldn't be the first time.
Table 4. Casus (continued).
C101: Esther, you've made a number of statements. We'll now
write them down one by one. You said at the end of the
discussion: ``I want to be a big girl and say something
about it.'' Can you elaborate on that?
E101: I think that I shouldn't be afraid. I don't want to be so
afraid for my own job that I no longer protect the most
vulnerable. Then I'd only be acting out of self-interest.
C102: You don't want to act out of self-interest, but instead
stand up for the interests of others.
E102: Exactly. If everyone only thought of themselves, that
would be at the expense of the most vulnerable. I
don't want to be like that.
C103: So, I'll write down: ``I want to stand up for the interests
of the most vulnerable.'' And also: ``I don't want to act
out of self-interest.''
E103: Not purely out of self-interest, no.
. . .
C150: And this statement from the beginning: ``That's no way
to treat people.''
E150 What management is doing isn't just. You have to treat
people with respect, you can't just unceremoniously dis-
card them.
C151 Discard
E151 If someone's given her all for your hospital for 40 years, I
think you should thank them for all that they've done
and let them work in peace until they retire. It's a ques-
tion of respect and appreciation.
C152 I'm writing down: ``I believe you should treat people
with respect and appreciation.''
Table 5. Casus (continued).
C201 Esther, the statement ``I want to stand up for the inter-
ests of the weakest'' 足 is that something you have to do,
something you would like to do or is it how you know
yourself to be?
E202 Well, I definitely don't do it all the time, I try to do it
more often. I've sometimes spoken out in the past, but it
cost me dearly. So, it's something that I'd like to do, but I
don't have to.
C202 Is it your wish to act in such a way?
E202 Yes. So that goes on the right with the ideals?
C203 It's up to you where you put it. You can always move it
again.
E204 With the ideals, then.
C205 And how important is it to you?
E205 Very important. So, put in the middle.

Looking Back
In this article, we have attempted to record our latest
experiences and insights about what we earlier labeled
``moral counseling''. One insight is that ``contemplative lis-
tening in moral issues'' would be a more appropriate term.
We have described the development of the model using
our own experiences and reflections. We believe that the
model is theoretically sound and that it has been tested in
practice. This article does not seek to be a manual for
contemplative listening in moral issues. In our view, this
form of listening cannot simply be learned from a book,
but requires a good deal of practice and in particular, learn-
ing from feedback. The over 100 course participants who
we have taught the basic skills of contemplative listening in
moral issues over the past ten years will confirm this. We
are also grateful to them for their feedback. Without them,
this article could not have been written.
Acknowledgments
We are particularly grateful to Hans Evers for the rationale
behind our discussion method. We would also like to thank him
for his critical comments on our manuscript and his contribution
to developing our training courses. Furthermore, we wish to
thank Radboud in'to Languages for translating the article and
their editorial suggestions.

Table 7. Casus (continued; end).
E301 Gosh, I thought I was doing the just thing by keeping my
mouth shut. But in fact, I've known for a long time that I
wanted to say something. It's just that I was so scared
about my job. But now I feel that I simply can't ignore
this injustice. Also, because otherwise, management
would simply keep treating us this way. I can't keep
going on acting as though nothing has happened.
Table 6. Casus (continued).
C206 Here I've got: ``I'm a breadwinner, I have to keep my
job.'' Where would you put that?
E206 Well, I don't want to lose my job, otherwise I would
have said something long ago and looked for other
work. I have to keep this job in the interests of my
family.Isn't that a fact that I have to take into account?
Weren't interests at the top?
C207 And are they your own interests, those of a significant
other or of ``them''?
E207 My family, so in the middle square. And that's very
important, but also not so bad. As a mother, I'd rather
set a good example than be afraid to open my mouth at
work.
