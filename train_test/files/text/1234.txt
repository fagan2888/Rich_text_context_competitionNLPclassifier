HEALTH of U.S. adults is strongly associated with their
socioeconomic position (1). Adults with more educa-
tion and income have a lower burden of disease, fewer phys-
ical limitations, less disability, and longer life expectancy
(2­4). The pathophysiological mechanisms linking lower
socioeconomic position (SEP) to worse health, however, are
poorly understood. Exposure to infections and inflamma-
tion has been proposed as a potentially important determi-
nant of chronic disease and mortality risk (5), but current
knowledge of the socioeconomic patterning of infection
burden in the U.S. population is limited.
Increasing evidence points to links between chronic dis-
ease and persistent infections including herpesviruses, Heli-
cobacter pylori, periodontal pathogens, and hepatitis
viruses. For example, the herpesviruses cytomegalovirus
(CMV) and herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) have been
linked to cardiovascular disease, frailty, cognitive outcomes,
and Alzheimer's disease (6­9). Infection with CMV and
HSV-1 is common in childhood (10), with the viruses re-
maining latent in the host throughout the life course. The
bacterium H. pylori can also lie dormant in the body for
decades until the bacteria-host equilibrium is disturbed. Be-
sides its role in peptic ulcer disease, H. pylori has been im-
plicated in the development of stroke and ischemic heart
disease through inflammatory pathways, lipid alterations,
and homocysteine-induced endothelial dysfunction (11).
Hepatitis B virus (HBV), known for its role in chronic liver
disease, has been hypothesized to contribute to atherogenic
diseases via systemic effects on immune response and colo-
nization of vascular tissues (12,13). Common periodontal
pathogens such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans
and Porphyromonas gingivalis have also been implicated in
coronary heart disease and stroke and have been found in
atherosclerotic plaques (14,15). Persistent infection has also
been implicated as a factor in the development of functional
limitations (1,5). For example, seropositivity to CMV was
associated with frailty in one study, and in another study,
higher CMV IgG antibody levels were associated with func-
tional impairment (9,16).
The presence of multiple persistent infections may contrib-
ute to morbidity beyond the impact of individual infections
(17­20). Presence of one infection might raise the risk of
other infections or increase the deleterious effects of other
pathogens, or both. For example, work byVilkuna-Rautiainen
and colleagues suggests that combined infection with HSV
and periodontal bacteria may increase the risk for cardiovas-
cular disease through decreasing levels of high-density lipo-
protein cholesterol more than each pathogen alone (21). From
a population perspective, burden of infection and inflamma-
tion has been hypothesized as an explanation for cohort

Background. The pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie health disparities by socioeconomic status and race/
ethnicity are poorly understood. Promising new research suggests that the burden of persistent infection may influence
adult disease risk and mortality. This article examines how multiple persistent infections cluster within individuals and
how this clustering varies by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity in U.S. adults.
Methods. We analyze data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (N = 19,275) for adults
aged 17­90 years. The clustering of infections within individuals is studied using tetrachoric correlations. Multiple indi-
cator multiple cause models are used to analyze the infection burden construct as measured by seropositivity to Helico-
bacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, and hepatitis B, focusing on the burden's distribution by
socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity. The results are corroborated using ordered logistic regression for a commonly
used count index of individual infections.
Results. Seroprevalence of individual persistent infections is positively correlated, suggesting common factors related
to exposure or susceptibility. Education, income, and race/ethnicity are strong and significant independent predictors of
infection burden in U.S. adults in all models.
Conclusion. The disproportionate burden of persistent infections among disadvantaged groups across all ages may be
one biologic pathway by which low socioeconomic position is related to increased rates of morbidity and mortality in the
United States.

changes in life expectancy as well as black or white differ-
ences in artherosclerosis in the early 20th century (5,22,23).
Recent research has begun addressing socioeconomic and
race/ethnic differences in individual infection status in the
United States. Adults with less education and income, as
well as minorities, have been shown to have a higher preva-
lence of hepatitis viruses, Toxoplasma gondii, H. pylori,
HSV-2, and CMV (10,24­26). Data from theWhitehall study
in the UK found that employment grade was related to bur-
den of infection as measured by the summed infection se-
rostatus for three pathogens (CMV, HSV-1, and Chlamydia
pneumonia) (27). However, there is little research on the re-
lationship between social factors and coinfection with mul-
tiple persistent infections in the United States. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to investigate whether education,
income, and race/ethnicity are related to infection burden in
a representative sample of U.S. adults. In addition, we at-
tempt to improve upon earlier approaches to studying burden
of infection by constructing a novel latent variable represent-
ing multiple persistent infections within individuals.
Methods
Sample
The analyses used data from the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES) III survey conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics between 1988 and
1994. NHANES III was a cross-sectional, stratified, multi-
stage probability sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized
U.S. population aged 2 months to 90 years, with an oversam-
ple of Mexican American and non-Hispanic black respon-
dents. The survey was collected in two phases (1988­1991
and 1991­1994), each individually designed to give nationally
representative estimates. Some variables were not collected
during both phases; specifically, H. pylori was only measured
only during phase I and dental pathogens only in phase II. Data
were collected in household interviews, clinical examinations,
and laboratory tests. Details of the sampling design and proto-
col have been previously reported (28,29). We analyzed data
for non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
adults aged 17­90 years (N = 19,275). There were no missing
observations on most demographic variables, including race/
ethnicity. Education and income variables were missing in 1%
and 10% of cases, respectively.Among the infection variables,
the proportion missing ranged from 14% for CMV to 21% for
H. pylori (out of phase I respondents). Respondents with miss-
ing information on any given pathogen were excluded from
the corresponding pathogen-specific analyses including the
count index models, but they were included in the multiple
indicator multiple cause (MIMIC) models unless all four
pathogen data points were missing. Participants missing in-
fection data tended to be older than those with valid data but
otherwise not systematically different in key sociodemo-
graphic variables.
Measures
Laboratory assays.--NHANES III conducted the sero-
positivity coding. The laboratory procedures, analytical
methods, and quality control are described in detail in the
NHANES III laboratory manual (30). The cut points for se-
ropositivity to each infection are based on commercially
available immunoassay clinical diagnostics that provide in-
formation on IgG antibody seropositivity (HSV, H. pylori,
CMV) and the presence of HBV core antigen as described
in the NHANES lab manuals (30). For P. gingivalis and
A. actinomycetemcomitans, continuous IgG antibody mea-
sured in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU)
values were provided by NHANES for each of these patho-
gens. We used the standard cutoffs for P. gingivalis
(168 EU) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (156 EU).
Burden of infection.--Helicobacter pylori, CMV, HSV-1,
and HBV were used for the infection burden analyses. Den-
tal pathogens were not included because they were mea-
sured only during phase II of the survey, whereas H. pylori
was measured only in phase I. Due to the lack of overlap,
we could only include one of these. We chose H. pylori be-
cause the number of participants who had values for H. py-
lori contemporaneous with other pathogens (HSV, CMV,
HBV) was more than double compared with those with den-
tal pathogen values measured at phase II. The burden vari-
able was constructed in two ways: (a) using confirmatory
factor analysis incorporated into MIMIC models and (b) as
a count index (range 0­4) where we added the seropositive
status for the four infections.
Socioeconomic position.--Education was trichotomized:
less than high school (<12 years), high school completion
(reference), and more than high school (>12 years). Income
categories were based on poverty-income ratio, the ratio of
the family's income to the federal poverty line for a specific
household composition. The cut points were 125% and 250%
of the poverty threshold, with middle category as reference.
Demographic variables.--Race/ethnicity was classified
as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American. We adjusted for age in years, gender, census re-
gion, rural or urban residence, marital status, foreign born,
and household size.
Statistical Analysis
First, prevalence of individual infections by race/ethnicity
was compared using chi-square tests. Second, associations
among individual infections were measured using tetra-
choric correlations with pairwise deletion and exact two-
sided significance tests.
Third, infection burden was modeled using MIMIC models,
a special case of structural equation models (31), to capture

the underlying clustering of these infections within individu-
als.The MIMIC model had two components: (a) measurement
part, where a latent variable (infection burden), was modeled
as influencing observed indicators (individual infections), and
(b) structural part where the latent variable was a function of
observed predictors (SEP and race/ethnicity). The model is
shown schematically in Figure 3. We used a weighted least
squares mean and variance-adjusted estimator, optimal for
data with missing values and ordinal dependent variables (27).
This estimator allowed using data from both phases of the sur-
vey. The fit of the model to data was evaluated by comparative
fit index (CFI) and root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA). These two measures indicate a satisfactory fit to
the data if their values are above .9 and below .05, respectively.
Results from the structural component are presented as stan-
dardized coefficients.
Finally, we estimated ordered logit models to test the as-
sociation of SEP and race/ethnicity with the count infection
burden index. These models were estimated using only data
from phase I of the survey because H. pylori was not mea-
sured during phase II. The descriptive and multivariate anal-
yses were adjusted for sampling weights and clustering.
Analyses were conducted using Stata 10.0 (2007; Stata-
Corp, College Station, TX) and Mplus 4.21 (2007; Muthén
and Muthén, Los Angeles, CA).

SOCIOECONOMICS AND BURDEN OF INFECTION 275
Correlations among individual infections are shown in
Table 2. The strongest correlations were among H. pylori,
CMV, and HSV-1, between .42 and .46. The associations
between HBV, P. gingivalis, and A. actinomycetemcomitans
were weaker but significant for most pairs.
Figure 2 shows the mean level of the count infection bur-
den ranging from 0 to 4 across age, by race/ethnicity and
education (results by income were similar--not shown). In-
fection burden increased monotonically with age. In all age
groups, the burden was higher for those with less education
across all race/ethnic groups, except for the crossover
among elderly Mexican Americans.
Results from the MIMIC models are summarized in
Table 3. All three models had an acceptable fit to the data
(CFI  .90 and RMSEA  .02). The measurement compo-
nent indicated that the latent burden construct explained a
significant proportion of variance in the observed infec-
tions. The R2 values were between .33 and .58 for H. pylori,
CMV, and HSV-1, and .14 to .15 for HBV. All uncon-
strained factor loadings were reasonably high and had
p values less than .01, suggesting a strong relationship with
the underlying burden variable. These results corroborated
the correlation findings and supported the conceptualiza-
tion of infection burden as a valid latent construct. The
standardized coefficients in the model's structural compo-
nent indicate change in the infection burden, measured in
standard deviations, for one standard deviation change in
the predictor. Lower education and income were associated
with a significantly higher burden of infection. Independent
of education and income, non-Hispanic black adults and
Mexican Americans had a significantly higher burden of
infection compared with non-Hispanic white adults. The

predictors explained 59%­63% of variance in the burden
variable.
Results from the ordered logit models (Table 4) corrobo-
rated the MIMIC model findings. Both SEP and race/
ethnicity were strongly associated with the count burden in-
dex. Individuals with less than a high school education had
roughly 50% higher odds of having an additional infection
compared with high school graduates, whereas those with
postsecondary education had 50% lower odds. Income had
similar effects, whereby low income was associated with
33% higher odds of an additional infection, and high in-
come with 45% lower odds, compared with the middle-
income group. Education and income had independent
effects on the infection burden (model 3). Net of socioeco-
nomic position, Mexican Americans had three to four times
the odds of an additional infection, and non-Hispanic black
adults had four to five times the odds, compared with non-
Hispanic white adults. Interactions of race/ethnicity and
SEP were not statistically significant, suggesting that the ef-
fect of SEP was similar within the three race/ethnic groups.
Discussion
This study identified socioeconomic and racial or ethnic
disparities in the burden of multiple persistent infections in
a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. The indi-
vidual infections are positively correlated with one another,
suggesting a nonrandom clustering of infections within in-
dividuals. Moreover, this clustering is systematically asso-
ciated with socioeconomic characteristics.Adults with more
education and income have a lower burden of persistent
infections throughout adulthood, and non-Hispanic white
adults have a lower burden than minority adults. These find-
ings suggest that the burden of persistent infection may be
one pathway through which lower socioeconomic position
"gets under the skin" and leads to an earlier onset of disease
and mortality.
Our results are consistent with recent work from the UK
that found occupational grade associated with pathogen bur-
den in 451 middle-aged adults, as measured by the summed
serostatus of CMV, HSV-1 and Chlamydia pneumoniae (27).
Our study adds to this earlier research by investigating a
broader set of infections thought to be associated with
chronic disease, a wider age range, more flexible analytic
methods, and two measures of socioeconomic position in a
large, nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.
The results of this study suggest that race/ethnic differ-
ences in the burden of infection are not due solely to differ-
ences in income or education. One reason for the race/ethnic
differentials may be transmission dynamics, whereby
groups that live and work together may retain their histori-
cally high infection rates even as socioeconomic conditions
change. Foreign-born Mexican Americans have higher in-
fection rates than native-born Mexican Americans, and
these higher rates may increase transmission within the
Mexican American community, compared with the
non-Hispanic white adults. Another potential explanation is
that even at a given level of education or income, racial and
ethnic minorities may be subject to increased social stress
(32). This stress may downregulate immunity, making non-
Hispanic black adults and Mexican Americans more sus-
ceptible to infections (33). Although the current data do not
allow investigation of these hypotheses, it is a promising
direction for future research.

chronic health outcomes. Depending on the infection and
where it resides within the hosts cells, persistent infection
may lead to (a) direct damage to infected host tissue, (b)
chronic immune reactivity and promotion of a systemic
proinflammatory environment characterized by an increase
in cytokines and acute phase proteins (19), and (c) changes
in normal cellular processes through pathogen-host ge-
nomic integration (eg, alterations in tumor suppressor gene
function) (34).
The relationship between SEP and inflammatory markers
related to both infectious and chronic diseases have been
established recently (35). In the United States, those with
more education were found to have significantly lower lev-
els of inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein,
interleukin-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1.
The biologic inducers of inflammation, however, are rarely
studied. Little is known regarding the role of persistent in-
fections as mediators of the relationship between SEP and
inflammation. An important next step is to test whether
clustering of persistent infections is a source of the increased
inflammation levels found among low-SEP adults.
Because timing of exposure to each infection is not avail-
able in the NHANES data set, it is not possible to distin-
guish whether the observed SEP and race/ethnicity patterns
are a result of differentials in initial exposure or heightened
susceptibility to infections, or an interaction of the two. Sec-
ond, it is likely that there are other pathogens that could be
added to our burden index, including those not measured in
NHANES III and those yet to be discovered. Nevertheless,
pathogens included in this study have been implicated in
chronic age-related diseases and therefore likely represent
key infections of interest for disease disparity research (6­
9). In addition, it is not possible to distinguish whether the
observed age patterns for infection burden reflect age or co-
hort effects in this cross-sectional study. However, the avail-
ability of a wide range of persistent infections in a very

large nationally representative sample of U.S. adults has al-
lowed us to move beyond traditional methods of simply
summing the number of infections and allowed us to test the
degree to which infection with one pathogen is associated
with other infections.
In conclusion, this is the first published study to our
knowledge that has examined the influence of socioeco-
nomic position on infection burden in a nationally represen-
tative sample of the U.S. population. Future studies are
needed to study infection burden as a potential mediator of
the SEP-health gradient. Given the growing research impli-
cating persistent infections in an array of chronic disease
processes, reducing social disparities in the burden of infec-
tion may be an important target for reducing health dispari-
ties and enhancing health of the population.

Figure 3. Diagram of the Full Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause (MIMIC)
Model. The MIMIC model has two components: (a) a measurement component,
where one latent variable (ie, infection burden), is modeled as underlying a
structure of observed indicators (ie, individual infections), and (b) a structural
component where the latent variable is modeled as a function of observed pre-
dictors (socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity). For parsimony, the figure
does not show correlations among the predictors or the residual errors for the
burden indicators and their covariance. H. pylori = Helicobacter pylori; CMV =
cytomegalovirus; HBV = hepatitis B virus; HSV-1 = herpes simplex virus type
1; CFA = confirmatory factor analysis.
