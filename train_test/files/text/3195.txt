Abstract
This paper develops a small New Keynesian model with capital accumulation and
government debt dynamics. The paper discusses the design of simple monetary and fiscal
policy rules consistent with determinate equilibrium dynamics in the absence of Ricardian
equivalence. Under this assumption, government debt turns into a relevant state variable
which needs to be accounted for in the analysis of equilibrium dynamics. The key analytical
finding is that without explicit reference to the level of government debt it is not possible to
infer how strongly the monetary and fiscal instruments should be used to ensure determinate
equilibrium dynamics. Specifically, we identify in our model discontinuities associated with
threshold values of steady-state debt, leading to qualitative changes in the local determinacy
requirements. These features extend the logic of Leeper (1991) to an environment in which
fiscal policy is non-neutral. Naturally, this non-neutrality increases the importance of fiscal
aspects for the design of policy rules consistent with determinate dynamics.

Non-technical summary
The literature on the desirable design of macroeconomic policies typically concludes that operational
policy rules should not be a source of non-fundamental fluctuations in economic activity, implying
that the induced rational expectations equilibrium should be at least locally unique. While this
criterion for a good policy design is widely shared, the literature exhibits a remarkable asymmetry
with respect to the analysis of monetary and fiscal aspects of policy rules. Monetary policy rules,
typically specified as interest rate rules with feedbacks to endogenous variables like inflation or
output, have been analyzed in great analytical detail. But there is no similarly rich literature on the
appropriate use of fiscal instruments.
This asymmetric treatment is adequate in many commonly used models in which fiscal policy acts
through variations in lump-sum taxes in an environment of Ricardian equivalence. In line with the
logic spelled out in Leeper (1991), the joint design problem of monetary and fiscal policy-making then
essentially reduces to two separable problems which can be recursively addressed. First, isolated from
fiscal aspects, there are monetary aspects, as witnessed by the large literature on the Taylor principle
which typically establishes conditions for local equilibrium determinacy solely in terms of monetary
policy parameters. Second, if the monetary dynamics are determinate, there is no 'active' role for fiscal
policy, i.e. the determinacy feature remains preserved if government debt dynamics evolve 'passively'
in a stable manner. If, however, the dynamic system without fiscal policy exhibits one degree of
indeterminacy, then potentially unstable debt dynamics are needed to restore equilibrium determinacy,
consistent with Leeper's notion of 'active' fiscal policy or, alternatively, with the view of the 'fiscal
theory of the price level' expressed in Woodford (1994) and Sims (1994).
The main contribution of this paper is to show how this logic needs to be modified in an environment
which departs from Ricardian equivalence, implying that equilibrium dynamics are driven by a
genuine interaction of monetary and fiscal policy. To this end, we develop a tractable New Keynesian
model in which wealth effects of government debt are not restricted to the intertemporal budget
constraint of the government but fully interact with all remaining equilibrium conditions of the
economy. This implies that government debt turns into a relevant state variable which needs to be
accounted for in the analysis of local equilibrium dynamics.
In our analysis, the 'relevance' of government debt translates into two findings. First, without explicit
reference to the steady-state level of government debt it is not possible to infer how strongly the
monetary and fiscal instruments within simple feedback rules should be used to ensure locally
determinate equilibrium dynamics. Second, the determinacy regions depend on the underlying level of
debt in a discontinuous way such that the determinacy conditions undergo qualitative changes at
certain threshold values of steady-state debt. Reflecting the assumed non-neutrality of fiscal policy,
these two features overturn the logic of separable monetary and fiscal dynamics as sketched above and
lead overall to a more symmetric treatment of monetary and fiscal policy aspects.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Die Literatur zum Design makroökonomischer Politikregeln kommt typischerweise zu dem Ergebnis,
dass einfache und operationale Regeln keine Quelle für nicht fundamental begründete Schwankungen
ökonomischer Aktivität sein sollten. Im Kontext rationaler Erwartungsgleichgewichte impliziert dies,
dass das Gleichgewicht zumindest lokal eindeutig determiniert sein sollte. Obwohl dieses Kriterium
für eine vernünftige Ausgestaltung makroökonomischer Politikregeln weitgehend akzeptiert ist,
zeichnet sich die Literatur durch eine beachtliche Asymmetrie in der Analyse von geld- und
fiskalpolitischen Aspekten makroökonomischer Regeln aus. Geldpolitische Regeln, die zumeist als
Zinsregeln konzipiert sind, die mit einem Feedback auf endogene Größen wie Inflation oder
Outputniveau reagieren, sind zuletzt in großer analytischer Detailliertheit untersucht worden.
Demgegenüber gibt es jedoch keine vergleichbar detaillierte Literatur zum adäquaten Einsatz
fiskalpolitischer Instrumente.
Diese Asymmetrie ist angemessen in Modellzusammenhängen, die durch Ricardianische Äquivalenz
geprägt sind und in denen Fiskalpolitik durch Variationen nicht verzerrender Steuern implementiert
wird. Unter diesen speziellen Annahmen reduziert sich im Sinne des Ansatzes von Leeper (1991) die
genuine Interdependenz geld- und fiskalpolitischer Entscheidungen zu zwei separierbaren
Teilproblemen, die rekursiv gelöst werden können. In einem ersten Schritt, unabhängig von
fiskalischen Aspekten, lässt sich das geldpolitische Design der Regeln charakterisieren. Dieser Ansatz
liegt der umfassenden Literatur zum Taylor-Prinzip zugrunde, die Anforderungen an lokal eindeutig
determinierte Gleichgewichte zumeist nur über geldpolitische Politikparameter charakterisiert. In
einem zweiten Schritt lässt sich dann, für eine gegebene geldpolitische Spezifikation, die das lokale
Determiniertheitskriterium erfüllt, das Ergebnis herleiten, dass Fiskalpolitik nicht ,aktiv' konzipiert
sein sollte, d.h. die lokale Determiniertheit bleibt erhalten, solange sich die Staatsverschuldung
,passiv' und stabil über die Zeit entwickelt. Falls jedoch im ersten Schritt das dynamische System
ohne Fiskalpolitik einen Freiheitsgrad aufweist, der zu einem lokal indeterminierten Gleichgewicht
führt, dann kann im zweiten Schritt einer potentiell instabilen Dynamik der Staatsverschuldung die
Rolle zugewiesen werden, die lokale Determiniertheit des Gesamtsystems sicherzustellen, im Sinne
einer ,aktiven' Fiskalpolitik Leepers beziehungsweise in Einklang mit Einsichten der fiskalischen
Theorie des Preisniveaus, wie von Woodford (1994) und Sims (1994) formuliert.
Dieser Beitrag entwickelt einen Rahmen, mit dem sich zeigen lässt, wie diese Logik zu modifizieren
ist, wenn bei Abwesenheit Ricardianischer Äquivalenz der Modellzusammenhang durch eine genuine
Interaktion von Geld- und Fiskalpolitik charakterisiert ist. Dazu wird ein analytisch handhabbares
Neu-Keynesianisches Modell entwickelt, in dem die Vermögenseffekte staatlicher Schuldtitel nicht
auf die intertemporale Budgetrestriktion des Staates beschränkt sind, sondern vielmehr mit allen
anderen Gleichgewichtsbedingungen interagieren. Diese Annahme impliziert, dass die Staatsschuld
eine relevante Zustandsvariable ist, die in der Analyse lokaler Determiniertheitsbedingungen zu
berücksichtigen ist.
Die Relevanz der Staatsschuld im Sinne einer wichtigen Zustandsvariablen führt zu zwei wichtigen
Ergebnissen. Erstens, ohne eine explizite Charakterisierung des Niveaus der Staatsschuld im
langfristigen Gleichgewicht ist es nicht möglich zu ermitteln, wie stark die geld- und fiskalpolitischen
Instrumente in einfachen Feedbackregeln einzusetzen sind, um eine lokal eindeutig determinierte
Gleichgewichtsdynamik zu gewährleisten. Zweitens, die Determiniertheitsregionen sind eine nicht
stetige Funktion des Niveaus der langfristigen Staatsschuld, so dass es an bestimmten
Schwellenwerten der Staatsschuld zu qualitativen Verschiebungen bei den geld- und fiskalpolitischen
Feedbackparametern kommt. Diese beiden Ergebnisse, die ein direktes Resultat der unterstellten
Nicht-Neutralität der Fiskalpolitik sind, relativieren die eingangs skizzierte dynamische
Separierbarkeit von Geld- und Fiskalpolitik in einfachen makroökonomischen Politikregeln und
implizieren eine eher symmetrische Rolle der beiden Politikbereiche, auf die bei der Ausgestaltung der
Regeln Rücksicht zu nehmen ist.

1 Introduction
The literature on the desirable design of macroeconomic policies typically concludes that
operational policy rules should not be a source of non-fundamental fluctuations in economic
activity, implying that the induced rational expectations equilibrium should be at least
locally unique. While this criterion for a good policy design is widely shared, the literature
exhibits a remarkable asymmetry with respect to the analysis of monetary and fiscal
aspects of policy rules. Monetary policy rules, typically specified as interest rate rules
with feedbacks to endogenous variables like inflation or output, have been analyzed in
great analytical detail.2 But there is no similarly rich literature on the appropriate use of
fiscal instruments.
This asymmetric treatment is adequate in many commonly used models in which fiscal pol-
icy acts through variations in lump-sum taxes in an environment of Ricardian equivalence.
In line with the logic spelled out in Leeper (1991), the joint design problem of monetary
and fiscal policy-making then essentially reduces to two separable problems which can be
recursively addressed. First, isolated from fiscal aspects, there are monetary aspects, as
witnessed by the large literature on the Taylor principle (Taylor, 1993) which typically
establishes conditions for local equilibrium determinacy solely in terms of monetary pol-
icy parameters. Second, if the monetary dynamics are determinate, there is no `active'
role for fiscal policy, i.e. the determinacy feature remains preserved if government debt
dynamics evolve `passively' in a stable manner. If, however, the dynamic system without
fiscal policy exhibits one degree of indeterminacy, then potentially unstable debt dynamics
are needed to restore equilibrium determinacy, consistent with Leeper's notion of `active'
fiscal policy or, alternatively, with the view of the `fiscal theory of the price level' expressed
in Woodford (1994), Sims (1994), and Woodford (2003, ch. 4.4).
The main contribution of this paper is to show how this logic needs to be modified in
an environment which departs from Ricardian equivalence, implying that equilibrium dy-
namics are driven by a genuine interaction of monetary and fiscal policy. To this end, we

develop a tractable New Keynesian model in which wealth effects of government debt are
not restricted to the intertemporal budget constraint of the government but fully interact
with all remaining equilibrium conditions of the economy. This implies that government
debt turns into a relevant state variable which needs to be accounted for in the analysis of
local equilibrium dynamics.3 In our analysis, the `relevance' of government debt translates
into two findings. First, without explicit reference to the steady-state level of government
debt it is not possible to infer how strongly the monetary and fiscal instruments within
simple feedback rules should be used to ensure locally determinate equilibrium dynamics.
Second, the determinacy regions depend on the underlying level of debt in a discontin-
uous way such that the determinacy conditions undergo qualitative changes at certain
threshold values of steady-state debt. Reflecting the assumed non-neutrality of fiscal pol-
icy, these two features overturn the logic of separable monetary and fiscal dynamics as
sketched above and lead overall to a more symmetric treatment of monetary and fiscal
policy aspects.
To make this reasoning precise, the analysis builds on a New Keynesian version of the
model of Blanchard (1985) in which, assuming that all taxation is lump-sum, departures
from Ricardian equivalence can be conveniently modelled through a change in a single pa-
rameter, the probability of death of consumers. Specifically, Ricardian equivalence ceases
to hold whenever this probability is assumed to be strictly positive, i.e. if consumers are
`non-Ricardian'.4 Because of the short-sightedness of non-Ricardian consumers, govern-
ment debt affects aggregate consumption dynamics via the Euler equation, and government
debt dynamics are no longer separable from the remaining equilibrium conditions. Mon-
etary and fiscal policy are assumed to follow two stylized rules with a deliberately simple
feedback structure. Monetary policy follows an interest rate rule which specifies how the
monetary instrument (i.e. the interest rate) reacts to deviations of actual inflation from a
target level of inflation. The single policy parameter of this rule is the `Taylor-coefficient'
on inflation, and monetary policy is called `active' (`passive') if this coefficient is larger
than unity, i.e. if the real interest rate rises (falls) in the inflation rate. Fiscal policy
follows a debt targeting rule which specifies how the unique fiscal instrument (i.e. the
lump-sum tax rate) reacts to deviations of the actual level of real government debt from a
target level of debt. The single policy parameter of this rule is the feedback coefficient of
taxes on debt. In line with Leeper (1991) and, among others, Sims (1998), Schmitt-Grohé
and Uribe (2004), and Davig and Leeper (2005), we call the fiscal rule `passive' (`active')
if this coefficient is larger (smaller) than the steady-state real interest rate.5
If consumers are non-Ricardian, our analysis of local steady-state dynamics shows that
there exist, depending on the assumed target level of government debt, two distinct stabil-
3 We do not adress dynamic properties from a global perspective. Moreover, to allow for an exlusive focus
on government debt, real balances are assumed to be a negligible fraction of total government liabilities.
4 For the same terminology, see Cushing (1999). In a related, but not identical specification Gali et al.
(2004) consider `rule-of-thumb consumers' who intertemporally can neither borrow nor save. Frequently,
the literature refers to this type of consumers also as `non-Ricardian'.
5 If defined in this way, a passive fiscal policy ensures under Ricardian equivalence that government
debt dynamics per se are not explosive, while under an active rule locally stable debt dynamics require the
adjustment of some other variable, like a change in the price level.

ity regimes characterized by `low' and `high' steady-state levels of debt.6 In both regimes,
local determinacy regions are not separated by the demarcation lines of active vs. passive
fiscal policy-making. Moreover, the two regimes have the feature that there always exist
regions of the parameter space (in terms of the two feedback parameters of the policy
rules) which ensure determinate dynamics at `low debt' steady states, but not at `high
debt' steady states, and vice versa. This feature makes it impossible to infer the ranges of
activism and passivism of both instruments consistent with local equilibrium determinacy
without explicit reference to the prevailing target level of government debt. Intuitively,
in our economy the level of debt fully captures the non-neutrality of fiscal policy through
the associated wealth effect in the Euler equation. The relative importance of this wealth
effect, however, varies in the level of debt. In particular, since the process of capital for-
mation is endogenous in the model of Blanchard (1985), there exists a link between the
steady-state level of debt and the degree of crowding out of capital. This in turn affects
the steady-state real interest rate which is a key input for the marginal cost schedule of
firms. In other words, when the capital stock is endogenous, wealth effects of government
debt lead to non-trivial demand and supply effects which allow for qualitatively distinct
dynamics at low and high levels of steady-state debt. Specifically, in a sense to be made
precise below, our model implies that in the high (low) debt regime the required degree
of fiscal discipline increases (decreases) if monetary policy becomes more active. Finally,
we show that this classification of local equilibrium needs further modifications if one also
allows for inefficient steady states.7
These rich findings contrast strongly with a regime of `Ricardian' consumers, character-
ized by the limiting assumption of a zero probability of death. In this regime, the wealth
effect of government debt in the Euler equation vanishes and the economy converges to
a Ramsey-economy characterized by Ricardian equivalence and separable fiscal dynam-
ics. Consequently, government debt is no longer an informative state variable and local
determinacy regions are separated by the demarcation lines of active vs. passive fiscal
policy-making, independently of the target level of government debt.
Our paper links to the related literature in a number of ways. First, it needs to be
emphasized that the usage of the terms `active' and `passive' policy-making, unfortunately,
is far from uniform in the literature. In particular, Leeper (1991) himself motivates his
analysis from a generic definition which classifies a policy as passive (active) if it shows an
(un)responsive reaction to current budgetary conditions. This leads him to the conclusion
that "a unique pricing function requires that at least one policy authority sets its control
variable actively, while an intertemporally balanced government budget requires that at
6 Throughout the analysis, government expenditures are specified as exogenous and changes in the
steady-state level of debt result from variations in the target level of the lump-sum tax rate. Hence, we
do not compare local dynamics between different fiscal instruments (i.e. between different fiscal closure
rules), as done, for example, in Michel et al. (2006). The assumption of exogenously specified government
expenditures makes it particularly tractable to analyze the role of wealth effects if consumers are non-
Ricardian.
7 Such steady states exist since the steady-state relationship between lump-sum taxes and debt turns
out to be non-monotic beyond a certain threshold value. Beyond this value, the target level of debt no
longer summarizes all the relevant information on which characterizations of stabilization policies should
be conditioned. Instead, the target levels of both taxes and debt need to be made explicit.
3
least one authority sets its control variable passively".8 From the perspective of such a
more encompassing definition, active and passive policy reactions, if considered outside
the particular structure of Leeper's model, are no longer necessarily linked to constant
threshold values of the feedback parameters in both policy rules. In principle, it would be
possible to reclassify our determinacy regions along these lines. However, this would not
affect our main result that under non-Ricardian consumers any such reclassification would
be conditional on the level of steady-state debt under consideration.
Second, a number of recent papers have addressed aspects of non-neutral fiscal policies
from a related perspective. Cushing (1999), Leith and Wren-Lewis (2000), Benassy (2005),
and Chadha and Nolan (2006) all consider versions of Blanchard (1985) and Weil (1991)
to discuss various properties of monetary and fiscal policy rules in environments which
depart from Ricardian equivalence. All these studies, however, abstract from capital stock
dynamics. Because of this feature, supply-side patterns are less rich and none of the
studies reports the existence of thresholds levels of debt which lead to qualitative changes
in the dynamic properties of the economy, as established in this paper.
Using standard Ramsey-type set-ups, Edge and Rudd (2002) and Linnemann (2006) con-
sider New Keynesian economies in which fiscal policy is non-neutral because of distor-
tionary taxation. Both papers show that this modification, conditional on the nature and
the degree of the distortion, changes the benchmark of the Taylor principle, but there is
no explicit reference to the role of debt. In similar spirit, Canzoneri and Diba (2005) give
fiscal policy a non-neutral role by assuming that government bonds provide transaction
services. Similar to our conclusion, the paper offers numerical results which show that the
aggressiveness of monetary policy which is needed to ensure locally determinate dynamics
depends non-trivially on fiscal parameters, but the paper does not report a systematic
role of government debt in this context. Davig and Leeper (2005) extend the original
contribution of Leeper (1991) to an environment with switching regimes which cover all
four combinations of active and passive monetary and fiscal policy-making. This feature
implies that shocks to fiscal policy affect the dynamics of the price level even if the regime
currently in place would suggest that Ricardian equivalence is satisfied.
Third, our paper relates to the growing literature on monetary policy and capital accu-
mulation, as recently summarized in Benhabib et al. (2005). In particular, because of the
continuous time dimension of the model of Blanchard (1985), our findings can be related
to Dupor (2001) and Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005), and we address this relationship in a
separate discussion in Section 5.
The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 develops the model economy.
Section 3 establishes the existence of steady states and summarizes the equations which
govern local dynamics around steady states. Section 4 derives the main results of the
paper on the determinacy of equilibria. Section 5 offers a self-contained discussion of
critical aspects of the labour supply specification. Section 6 concludes. Technical parts
and proofs are delegated to the Appendix.

however, to the complementary terminology of Ricardian vs. non-Riardian fiscal policies.

2 The Model
Consumers are specified as in Blanchard (1985) in that they face a constant probability
of death, denoted by   0. If this probability is positive ( > 0), the effective decision
horizon of private agents is shorter than of the government and the model differs through
this channel from a standard Ramsey-type infinite horizon economy. The latter type of
economy, however, can be discussed as a special case if one considers a zero probability of
death ( = 0).
2.1 Problem of the representative consumer
A consumer born at time j has a constant time endowment of unity per period. In a
representative period, he chooses consumption (cj
s) and real money balances (mj
s) in order
to maximize his intertemporal utility function, taking as given the rate of time preference
 and a constant probability of death .9 The individual labour supply is inelastically fixed
at nj
s = 1. We allow for three distinct assets: physical capital, interest-bearing government
debt, and real balances. Later on, when studying the dynamics of the economy, we consider
for simple tractability the cashless-limit. To this end, it is convenient to assume that real
balances enter the utility function of agents in an additively separable manner. Expected
utility of the consumer at time t reads as
EtUj =
Z

t
[ln cj
s
+  ln mj
s
] · e-(+)(s-t)ds, (1)
where  governs the share of real balances in the consumer's portfolio (and   0 corre-
sponds to the cashless limit). The consumer holds real non-human wealth aj
s = kj
s+bj
s+mj
s,
consisting of physical capital (kj
s), real government bonds (bj
s), and real balances. The con-
sumer's flow budget constraint is given by,

- mj
s
) + aj

+ ws

- cj

. (2)
Physical capital and real government bonds are perfect substitutes, earning the same risk-
less real rate of return rs, while real balances depreciate at the rate of inflation s. As
consumers do not live forever, competitive insurance companies are prepared to pay a
premium aj
s in each period in return for obtaining the non-human wealth of consumers
in the case of death. The individual is paid a real wage of ws and is subject to a lump-
sum tax j
s. Consumers also receive a share of the profits of final goods producers of j
s,
to be derived below. The first-order condition for consumption is given by cj
s = 1/j
s
,
where j
s
denotes the co-state variable from the current value Hamiltonian used to solve
the consumer's problem. Real balances satisfy /mj
s = j
s
(rs + s), leading to the money
demand equation mj
s = cj
s/(rs +s). The co-state variable evolves over time according to
dj

2.2 Aggregate behavior of consumers
Following Blanchard, it is convenient to normalize the population size (and, hence, the
labour force) by assuming that at any moment in time a new cohort is born of size .
Any such cohort born at j has a size, as of time t, of  · e-(t-j). Then, the size of the
total population will always be unity, since
R
t
-
 · e-(t-j)dj = 1, implying nt = 1 for all
t. Integrating over individuals of all cohorts yields the aggregate consumption and money
demand functions, respectively
ct =
 + 
1 + 
(at + ht) (3)
mt = 
ct
rt + t
,
with variables without the j-index denoting aggregates. The evolution of aggregate human
wealth follows dht = (rt + )ht
- wt + t
- t. Aggregate non-human wealth is given by
at = kt+bt+mt and follows the law of motion dat = rtat+wt-(1+)ct+t-t. For further
reference it is convenient to express the dynamics of the aggregate behavior of consumers
in terms of ct and at. Upon differentiating ct with respect to time and substituting out for
ht, one obtains
dct = (rt - )ct - 
 + 
1 + 
at. (4)
Equation (4) captures the well-known feature that, whenever  > 0, the growth rate
of individual consumption (rt
- ) exceeds the growth rate of aggregate consumption,
despite a constant propensity to consume out of wealth for all individuals. The reason
for this is given by the fact that at any moment in time agents with a high level of
non-human wealth are replaced by new-borns with zero non-human wealth. Because of
this generational turnover effect aggregate consumption dynamics in the Euler equation
(4) depend on the aggregate level of non-human wealth (which includes the outstanding
level of government liabilities), in contrast to a standard Ramsey-economy with  = 0. Of
6
course, this is not the only way of introducing non-Ricardian behaviour in a macromodel.
However, it has the advantage of introducing a pure wealth affect in consumption as the
form of deviation from Ricardian equivalence, and moreover, this effect is entirely captured
in a single parameter, , thereby facilitating comparison with a Ricardian benchmark.
Other relaxations of Ricardian equivalence, such as introducing credit constraints (Gali
et al. (2004)) or distortionary taxation (Linnemann (2006)), will often be less tractable
or contain direct supply side effects. Nevertheless, such devices are typically intended to
have the effect of allowing fiscal policy (and the level of debt) to affect aggregate demand,
such that our approach can be treated as a particularly tractable way of introducing such
an effect and, if desired, can be calibrated to mimic the empirical evidence on the ability
of fiscal policy to do this.
2.3 Problems of the representative firms
We have two types of firms in our model.
2.3.1 Capital rental firms
There is a competitive continuum of firms which accumulate capital for rental to final
goods producers. Let it denote the real investment of these firms, using a mix of final
goods which is identical to the private consumption pattern. Moreover, assume that
capital depreciates at the rate  > 0, leading to the law of motion for the capital stock
dkt = it
- kt.
Capital rental firms are owned by private households. The return on capital is identical
to the risk-free rate rt if the rental rate of capital (pk
t
) charged to the final goods sector
satisfies the zero-profit condition pk
t
= rt + .
2.3.2 Final Goods Producers
We assume that final goods are produced by imperfectly competitive firms which are
subject to the constraints implied by Calvo-contracts (Calvo, 1983), such that at any
point in time firms are able to change prices with instantaneous probability . Firms are
lined up along the unit interval and a typical firm, with index z, produces according to a
Cobb-Douglas function
y(z)t = n(z)
t
k(z)1-
t
.
Input markets are perfectly competitive. Cost-minimization implies that the combination
of labour and capital employed by the firm is given by
k(z)t
n(z)t
=
kt
nt
= kt =
1 - 

wt
pk
t
which is common across firms because of price-taking behavior in the input markets.
Because of the Cobb-Douglas assumption, the cost function is linear in output, with
7
marginal cost of production being given by
MCt = (pk
t
)1-w

-(1 - )-1.

2.4 The government
Let lt denote aggregate real liabilities of the public sector, consisting of real balances and
bonds, lt = mt + bt. Substituting out for mt, flow dynamics of public sector liabilities are
given by
dlt = rtlt - (rt + t)mt + g - t = rtlt - ct + g - t (6)

where gt = g > 0 denotes an exogenous and constant stream of government expenditures
in terms of aggregate final output. It is assumed that monetary and fiscal policies follow
two stylized rules with a deliberately simple feedback structure. First, regarding monetary
policy, we consider an inflation target of zero, i.e.  = 0. Given the nominal stickiness
due to Calvo-pricing contracts, the monetary agent has, in the short-run, leverage over
the real interest rate and we consider a feedback rule of the form
rt = r + fM (t - ),  = 0, (7)
where r stands for the steady-state level of the real interest rate to be derived below. The
single policy parameter fM in (7) is the Taylor-coefficient, as discussed in the literature
on interest rate rules inspired by Taylor (1993). Accordingly, monetary policy is called
`active' (`passive') if the real interest rate (rt) rises (falls) in the current inflation rate, i.e.
if fM > 0 (fM < 0). Since (7) is directly expressed in terms of the real (and not the
nominal) interest rate, the critical value of the Taylor-coefficient is zero (and not unity).
Second, fiscal policy follows a feedback rule which aims at stabilizing government liabilities
at some target level l. To achieve this target, lump-sum taxes get adjusted according to
t =  + fF (lt
- l). (8)
With gt = g being fixed, the only fiscal instrument in (8) is t. This strong assumption
serves to make departures from Ricardian equivalence in the local equilibrium analysis
below as simple and transparent as possible. According to (6), in any steady-state equi-
librium characterized by  = 0 real government bonds are given by
b =
 - g
r
, (9)
implying that the real value of outstanding government bonds must be completely backed
by the present value of future primary fiscal surpluses. There are two further comments
worth making regarding the cashless limit to be considered below. First, as   0, this
implies lt  bt, and the feedback rule (8) turns into a purely fiscal `debt targeting rule'.
Second, with real government debt growing at the real interest rate rt, debt dynamics in
(6) are, per se, locally not explosive if the single fiscal feedback parameter fF exceeds the
steady-state interest rate r. Following the logic of Leeper (1991), we call the fiscal rule (8)
`passive' if fF > r, while it is `active' in the opposite and non-stabilizing case of fF < r.11
2.5 Summary of equilibrium conditions
For further reference, the conditions which characterize dynamic equilibria at the aggregate
level can be summarized as follows.
Consumers:

(kt + lt) (10)
11 The local equilibrium analysis carried out below is based on approximated laws of motions. For the
analysis to be valid it is assumed that the two feedback parameters fM and fF are sufficiently close to the
benchmark values of 0 and r, respectively.

Income identities:
Mutual consistency of the plans of all consumers, firms, and the government requires that
in equilibrium aggregate final output yt satisfies the market clearing condition
yt = ct + g + it. (20)
In equilibrium, aggregate output must also satisfy the income identity
yt = wt + (rt + )kt + t, (21)
with aggregate profits t of the final goods sector defined as in equation (5). By the law
of Walras, however, (20) and (21) are not independent. If (10)-(20) are satisfied, (21) will
be satisfied as well if aggregate profits t follow (5). Because of the residual character of
t, we can drop (5) and (21) from the following analysis.
3 Steady states
3.1 Existence
To enhance the analytical tractability of the analysis we consider from now on the cashless
limit (  0), implying lt  bt. In steady state, p(z) = p, which we normalize to p = 1.
From (18), mark-up pricing implies ( - 1)/ = MC. Combining (16)-(17), factor prices
can be rewritten as a function of the capital stock

(1 - )k- -  = r(k), (23)
and w(k) and r(k) tend towards the marginal productivity expressions as the economy
becomes perfectly competitive (  ). Using (23), the remaining equations can be
arranged as a system in c and k. Combining the steady-state version of the consumption
Euler equation (10) with the government's budget constraint (11), yields
c = ( + ) ·
k + -g
r(k)
r(k) - 
, (24)
while the steady-state resource constraint is given by
c = k1- - k - g. (25)
Equations (24) and (25) are similar to Blanchard (1985) and can be graphed as in Figure
1(a) to establish the differences between environments characterized by Ricardian and
non-Ricardian consumers. In the Ricardian limit ( = 0), wealth effects with respect
to asset holdings disappear and the economy has a unique steady state (with k = kgr)
which is characterized by the modified golden rule r = , independently of the structure
of debt and taxes. By contrast, if  > 0 steady states exhibit r > , since `non-Ricardian'
consumers are more impatient than infinitely lived `Ricardian' consumers. To understand
the non-Ricardian case in further detail, consider initially a situation of a balanced primary
budget, i.e. g =   b = 0. Then, the economy is generically characterized by two steady
states with positive levels of consumption, capital and output, as long as the level of
11
government spending g > 0 is not too large. Holding this level of g constant, an increase
in  generates a positive level of government debt which at both steady states affects k
and c via wealth effects. Intuitively, government bonds are perceived as net wealth by
currently alive consumers, since the tax burden, backing these bonds, is partly borne by
members of future generations.12 However, the amount of debt that can be passed on
between different generations cannot be arbitrarily large. As  keeps rising, (25) in Figure
1(a) remains unaffected, while (24) shifts upward, and there exists a unique value (g),
with associated debt level b, beyond which the two steady states cease to exist.
We concentrate in the following exclusively on the high-activity steady state (EH) to
facilitate a meaningful comparison of our results with the Ricardian benchmark. To find
a simple operationalization for this, we make from now on the mild assumption
(A 1) 0 < g < y.
As shown in Appendix 1, under a balanced primary budget ( = g) any steady state which
satisfies (A 1) must be of the high-activity type.13 Importantly, as graphed in Figure 1(b),
at the high-activity steady state (EH) the relationship between  and b is non-monotonic
if one increases , holding g constant. The intuition for this feature is as follows. As  rises
the primary surplus  - g increases. Moreover, the real interest rate increases, since the
wealth effect leads to a crowding out of physical capital. These two effects make the net
effect on the steady-state debt level b, which is given by the discounted value of primary
surpluses (i.e. b = ( - g)/r)), ambiguous. For  sufficiently close to g the first effect
dominates and b rises in . However, there exists a unique value (g) which maximizes
the steady-state value of government debt at b, while b falls as  further increases in the
interval (, ). For future reference, we summarize this pattern as follows:
Lemma 1 Consider a steady state of (24) and (25) with a balanced primary budget which
satisfies 0 < g =  < y. Then, by varying  and holding g constant, there exists a range
of efficient high-activity steady states (EH) characterized by   (g, )  b  (0, b),
and there exists a range of inefficient high-activity steady states (EH) characterized by
  (, )  b  (b, b), as graphed in Figure 1(b).
Proof: See Appendix 1.
3.2 Local dynamics
Upon combining (10)-(20), local dynamics around steady states can be characterized by
a dynamic system in bt, ct, kt, and t. Given the non-linearity of the system, we consider
a first-order approximation. Let b
xt = xt-x
x
, d b
xt =  e
xt
t
=
·
xt
x
for x = b, c, k. As regards
inflation dynamics, since  = 0, we consider t and dt = ·
t, respectively.
12 For further details, see, in particular, Weil (1991). The crucial mechanism for this result is not the
probability of death, but rather the `disconnectedness' between consumers currently alive and those born
at some point in the future.
13 Assumption (A 1) says that the government expenditure ratio should be less than the Cobb-Douglas co-
efficient of labour which is typically assumed to be around 2/3. Hence, (A 1) does not impose a `restriction'
that could become binding under plausible calibrations.
12
Starting out from the differential equations (10), (11), and (14), when combined with the
two feedback rules (12) and (13), it is straightforward to obtain the approximated laws of
motion for b

The equations (26)-(29) constitute a four-dimensional linear system of differential equa-

jump variables (b
ct, t) with free initial conditions, and local dynamics can be assessed by
the Blanchard-Kahn conditions.14 Let J denote the Jacobian matrix of the system. Then,

4 Classification of local equilibrium dynamics
The next two sections address in turn the implications of (30) for the classification of local
equilibrium dynamics under Ricardian and non-Ricardian consumers, respectively.
4.1 Ricardian consumers ( = 0)
As discussed, steady states with Ricardian consumers ( = 0) are characterized by the
modified golden rule, r = . Hence, the matrix J in (30) turns into
J =

 (31)
14 The notion of a predetermined stock of real government debt can be justified as follows. First, because
a fraction of firms sets prices in a forwardlooking manner, the inflation rate t
is a jump variable. Second,
assume that the stock of nominal government bonds is predetermined. Then, real government debt must
be counted as a state variable, because it cannot move independently of the jump in inflation.
13
Compared with (30), the assumption of  = 0 simplifies the dynamic structure of the
economy in two important ways, both linked to the aggregate consumption Euler equation
as described by the second row in (31). First, since government bonds are not perceived
as net wealth, consumption dynamics are not affected by government debt dynamics,
( + )b
c
= 0. In fact, government debt dynamics do not affect any of the other three
dynamic equations. As a result of this separability, one eigenvalue of (31) is given by
 =  - fF . Second, the absence of wealth effects also implies that consumption dynamics
are not affected by capital dynamics, (+)k
c
= 0. This leads to a well-known and simple
relationship between the stance of monetary policy (measured by fM ) and the profile of
consumption close to the steady state, reflecting the assumption of logarithmic utility in
consumption. This relationship says that if in response to some shock inflation is above
target (t > 0) consumption slopes upward (downward), whenever monetary policy is
active (passive), while it stays flat if monetary policy is neutral (fM = 0).
Exploiting the separability of government debt dynamics, we address first the isolated
monetary dynamics before we then turn to the joint monetary and fiscal dynamics of (31).
4.1.1 Monetary dynamics
By deleting the first column and the first row in (31), monetary dynamics can be read-
ily inferred from the remaining sub-system in c, k, and . The monetary sub-system is
characterized by one state variable (k) and two forward-looking variables (c, ).
Proposition 1 Monetary dynamics
Consider the dynamic sub-system in c, k,  implied by the matrix (31).
1) Assume monetary policy is passive. Then, dynamics are always determinate.
2) Assume monetary policy is active. Then, dynamics are never determinate. There exists
a critical value q > 0 such that dynamics are indeterminate of degree 1 if fM > q.
Proof: With one state variable and two forward-looking variables, dynamics are deter-
minate if Jc,k, has one negative and two positive eigenvalues.15 Let
Det(Jc,k,) =
c
k
( + )fM , (32)
Tr(Jc,k,) = (1 - )
y
k
-  +  - ( + )
fM
 + 
(33)
denote the determinant and the trace of the 3x3-matrix Jc,k,, respectively. Assume
fM < 0. Then, Det(Jc,k,) < 0 and Tr(Jc,k,) > 0, implying one negative and two
positive eigenvalues. Assume fM > 0. Then, Det(Jc,k,) > 0, i.e. dynamics are never
determinate. Note that Tr(Jc,k,) is a linear function of fM , and Tr(Jc,k,) < 0 obtains
if fM becomes sufficiently large. Hence, there exists a critical value q such that Jc,k, has
two negative and one positive eigenvalues, implying dynamics are indeterminate of degree
1 if fM > q. ¤
15 We do not distinguish explicitly between real and conjugate complex eigenvalues, i.e. our classification
refers to the real part of any eigenvalue which is crucial for the stability behaviour.
14
Proposition 1 reflects the fact that local stability types of steady states under monetary
dynamics depend on the single feedback parameter fM . The critical value fM = 0 defines
the boundary value for the unique parameter region of determinacy.16 It is worth pointing
out that in the New Keynesian version of the model of Blanchard (1985), as developed in
this paper, passive (and not active) monetary policy is a necessary and sufficient condition
for determinate dynamics. Since the model is in many ways standard, the failure of the
Taylor-principle may seem surprising, but there are two non-standard elements. First,
labour supply is assumed to be fixed. Second, monetary policy has non-trivial supply-side
effects because of the contemporaneous link between the real interest rate and the return
on physical capital, as recently discussed in Dupor (2001) and Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).
We show below that the failure of the Taylor-principle is entirely due to the second aspect.
More specifically, we show, at the expense of more tedious algebra, that the classification
of Proposition 1 remains unaffected if one augments preferences with a standard elastic
or even linear labour supply specification. However, since the Taylor principle itself is
qualitatively not important for the main results of this paper, given our focus on the
dependence of the nature of local dynamics on the target level of government debt, we
delegate this discussion to a self-contained analysis in Section 5.
4.1.2 Monetary and fiscal dynamics
Under Ricardian consumers it is straightforward to extend any clear-cut characterization
of the monetary sub-dynamics, as summarized in Proposition 1, to a characterization of
the combined monetary and fiscal dynamics. Fiscal policy adds a second state variable
(b) and an additional eigenvalue  =  - fF . This eigenvalue is negative (positive) if fiscal
policy is passive (active). Combining this pattern with Proposition 1, one obtains:
Proposition 2 Monetary and fiscal dynamics
Consider the dynamic system in b, c, k,  implied by the matrix (31).
1) Assume monetary and fiscal policy are passive. Then, dynamics are always determinate.
2) Assume monetary and fiscal policy are active. Then, dynamics are determinate if
fM > q, with q as established in Proposition 1.
3) Assume monetary policy is passive and fiscal policy is active or, alternatively, monetary
policy is active and fiscal policy is passive. Then, dynamics are never determinate.
Proposition 2 summarizes that fiscal policy contributes to the local stability properties of
steady states in a rather mechanical way if consumers are Ricardian. Essentially, whenever
the monetary sub-dynamics by themselves are determinate, this feature will be preserved if
fiscal policy behaves passively, i.e. if government debt dynamics evolve in a self-stabilizing
manner. By contrast, active fiscal policy is decisive for the achievement of determinate
dynamics whenever the monetary sub-dynamics exhibit one degree of indeterminacy. Intu-
itively, in this situation active fiscal policy ensures that arbitrary expectations of inflation
16 For small positive values of fM one obtains Det(Jc,k,) > 0 and Tr(Jc,k,) > 0 such that fM = 0
separates a region of determinacy from a region of instability (i.e. all three eigenvalues are positive).

Figure 2: Monetary and fiscal dynamics: Ricardian consumers
can no longer be validated in equilibrium since the local stability requirement of govern-
ment debt imposes uniquely defined values for the forward-looking variables (c, ). This
same mechanism is also at the heart of the `fiscal theory of the price level', as developed
by Woodford (1994) and Sims (1994).
For future reference, Figure 2 illustrates how the assumption of Ricardian consumers
reduces the joint design problem of monetary and fiscal policy-making to two separable
problems which can be recursively addressed. Shaded areas describe the parameter regions
of determinacy established in Proposition 2. These regions are separated by the demar-
cation line of active vs. passive fiscal policy-making (fF = ) and they are independent
of the target level of government debt. Again, we point out that this qualitative result
does in no way depend on the failure of the Taylor-principle in Section 4.1.1 on monetary
dynamics. Similarly, a richer monetary feedback-rule (reacting, for example, also to some
measure of real economic activity along the lines of Woodford (2003)), leading to a crit-
ical value different from fM = 0, can be accommodated with the same logic, as long as
government debt dynamics remain separable.
4.2 Non-Ricardian consumers ( > 0)
Owing to the non-Ricardian structure, consumption dynamics are now, in general, affected
by the dynamics of government debt, implying that the transition matrix J in (30) is no
longer separable with respect to fiscal policy. Reflecting the non-neutral role of fiscal policy,
the entries of J in (30) depend crucially on the `position' of the high-activity steady state
(EH) which itself depends on fiscal policy. In particular, for any given level of g, the levels
of c, k and r depend on the steady-state mix between bonds and taxes in a non-trivial
manner, as summarized in Lemma 1.
To assess the implications of the non-Ricardian structure for the local dynamics of steady

Figure 3: Monetary and fiscal dynamics: non-Ricardian consumers
states it is instructive, in a first step, to investigate the necessary condition for determinacy
Det(J) = [r - fF ][0 + 1fM ] + r2fM > 0 (34)
where the coefficients 0, 1, and 2 are functions of the fiscal parameters. Notice that all
technical results used from now onwards in this Subsection are summarized in Appendix 3.
Rearranging (34) one obtains for the critical demarcation line Det(J) = 0 the expression
Det(J) = 0  fF = r(1 +
2fM
0 + 1fM
).
4.2.1 Efficient steady states
Assume first that steady states are efficient, implying that there is for a given level of
g a one-to-one relationship between taxes and debt, i.e. g <  <   0 < b < b.
Then, depending on the target level of debt, Det(J) = 0 has two distinct configurations
in fM - fF - space which can be graphed as in Figures 3(a) and (b). To relate these two
graphs to the previous discussion notice that if  = 0 the locus of Det(J) = 0 coincides,
irrespective of the level of debt, in both cases with the demarcation lines of active vs.
passive policy-making (i.e. fF = r and fM = 0), as graphed in Figure 2. If  > 0,
however, there exist two distinct regimes. Intuitively, for small levels of debt the wealth
effect is also small and the parameter region consistent with Det(J) > 0 is close to the
17
combinations of active and passive policy-making underlying Figure 2.17 As b rises the
wealth effect becomes relatively more important, leading to changes in the steady state
levels of c, k, r and, hence, also in 0, 1, and 2. We show that there exist unique
threshold values 1
 (g, )  b1
 (0, b) which lead to a change in the sign pattern
of 0, 1, and 2. This change implies that at the target level of government debt b1 the
locus associated with Det(J) = 0 switches from Figure 3(a) to Figure 3(b), leading to a
qualitative change of the local dynamics of the system. Intuitively, there is scope for the
existence of such threshold values because of the endogeneity of the capital stock. This
feature ensures that the wealth effect of government debt affects not only the demand side,
but also the supply-side of the system, since any change in the real interest rate resulting
from crowding out effects shifts the marginal cost schedule of firms. Figures 3(a) and (b)
reveal that this interaction is very non-linear. In particular, the two regimes, as graphed
in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), have the feature that there always exist regions of the parameter
space which are necessary for locally determinate dynamics at `low debt' steady states,
but not at `high debt' steady states, and vice versa.
The reasoning so far is based on a necessary condition. To make it more operational we
combine (34) with the additional trace-condition Tr(J) < 0. It can be established that
Det(J) > 0, Tr(J) < 0 (35)
is a sufficient condition for locally determinate dynamics.18 From (30), the trace of J is
given by
Tr(J) = 0
- fF - 1
· fM , with: (36)
0 = 3r -  + (1 - )
y
k
-  > 0, 1 =
(r + )
r + 
> 0,
which can be rearranged as
Tr(J) = 0  fF = 0
- 1
· fM . (37)
Equation (37) describes at all debt levels a straight line with positive intercept and neg-
ative slope in fM - fF - space, leading to the graphical representation of the sufficiency-
condition given in Figure 3. In sum, this leads to the conclusion:
Proposition 3 Monetary and fiscal dynamics at efficient steady states
Assume   (g, )  b  (0, b).
17 Specifically, assuming non-Ricardian consumers, it is easy to check within (30) that in the special
caseof of b = 0 one eigenvalue of J is given by r -fF . Hence, fF = r implies Det(J) = 0, similar to Figure
2. However, if b = 0 there are nevertheless wealth effects associated with the capital stock. Because of this
feature, fM = 0 no longer implies Det(J) = 0.
18 To further clarify the differences between Figures 2 and 3, notice that the shaded areas in Figure 2
are based on a condition which is necessary and sufficient for local determinacy. By contrast, in Figure
3 horizontally shaded areas correspond to a necessary condition, while horizontally and vertically shaded
areas correspond to a sufficient condition.
18
1) Reflecting the non-neutral role of fiscal policy, determinacy regions depend on the steady-
state level of debt and they are no longer separated by the demarcation lines of active and
passive fiscal policy-making.
2) There exist two qualitatively distinct regimes of local equilibrium dynamics, characterized
by low steady-state debt (i.e.   (g, 1)  b  (0, b1)) and high steady-state debt (i.e.
  (1, )  b  (b1, b)). These two regimes have the feature that there always exist
regions of the parameter space which ensure locally determinate dynamics at `low debt'
steady states, but not at `high debt' steady states, and vice versa, as graphed in Figures
3(a) and 3(b).
The first part of Proposition 3 summarizes the obvious insight that the assumption of non-
Ricardian consumers leads to a genuine interaction between monetary and fiscal policy.
This interaction implies that determinate dynamics require appropriate degrees of activism
and passivism within either rule, and these degrees need to be jointly established. The
second part of Proposition 3, however, is a priori not obvious, because it says that the
level of government debt affects the interaction between monetary and fiscal stabilization
policies in a highly non-linear way. In other words, if fiscal policy is non-neutral, mean-
ingful characterizations of monetary and fiscal stabilization policies are conditional on the
prevailing regime with respect to the target level of government debt. If this dependence is
not made explicit (and policies are solely characterized in terms of the feedback parameters
fF and fM ), policy recommendations may well be misleading.
To illustrate this general principle, consider, for the sake of exposition, a combination of ac-
tive monetary and passive fiscal policy-making. Under Ricardian consumers, this is never
consistent with determinate dynamics, reflecting the failure of the Taylor-principle in Sec-
tion 3 in the isolated monetary sub-dynamics. However, under non-Ricardian consumers
there always exist certain combinations of active monetary and passive fiscal policy-making
consistent with determinate dynamics. In other words, conditional on an appropriate spec-
ification of the passivism of fiscal policy, the Taylor principle reappears for certain degrees
of active monetary policy. Yet, depending on whether the steady state is characterized by
low or high debt, these combinations show significant differences.
Corollary 1 Active monetary and passive fiscal policy at efficient steady states
1) Consider steady states with low debt, i.e. 0 < b < b1. Then, if monetary policy becomes
more active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics decreases.
2) Consider steady states with high debt, i.e. b1 < b < b. Then, if monetary policy
becomes more active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics increases,
but remains bounded from above.
4.2.2 Inefficient steady states
For completeness, we extend the analysis to inefficient steady states, i.e. in terms of Figure
1(b) we focus on inefficiently high tax rates   (, ) which are associated with debt levels
b  (b, b). Under this assumption, there emerges a third region of the parameter space
with distinct equilibrium dynamics, as illustrated in Figure 3(c).
19
Proposition 4 Monetary and fiscal dynamics at inefficient steady states
Assume   (, )  b  (b, b). Then, the non-neutrality features of Proposition 3
extend to a third regime with qualitatively distinct local equilibrium dynamics, as graphed
in Figure 3(c).
Proposition 4 extends Proposition 3 in a straightforward manner. Essentially, it says that
if the relationship between taxes and debt becomes non-monotonic (in line with the logic
of Laffer curves) the target level of debt no longer summarizes all the relevant information
on which characterizations of stabilization policies should be conditioned. Instead, the
target levels of both taxes and debt need to be made explicit.
Not surprisingly, if non-Ricardian consumers face both high debt and inefficiently high
taxes this leads to local equilibrium dynamics which differ from the benchmark case of
Ricardian consumers in the strongest possible way, as shown in Figure 3(c). To summarize
the characteristics of this third regime, it is instructive to focus again on combinations of
active monetary and passive fiscal policy-making.
Corollary 2 Active monetary and passive fiscal policy at inefficient steady states
Consider inefficient steady states, i.e.   (, )  b  (b, b). Then, if monetary policy
becomes more active, the fiscal discipline consistent with determinate dynamics increases
without bound.19

5 Endogenous labour supply of Ricardian consumers
This self-contained section has the purpose to identify the mechanism which leads to
the failure of the Taylor-principle under Ricardian consumers ( = 0), as established
in Proposition 1. Specifically, the Section shows that this failure is not caused by the
assumption of a fixed labour supply which this paper has borrowed from the original
contribution of Blanchard (1985).20 Instead, the failure of the Taylor principle is due
to the contemporaneous link between the real interest rate and the return on physical
capital in continuous time models, in line with the careful discussions in Dupor (2001) and
Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).21 Moreover, if being sufficiently aggressive (fM > q) active
monetary policy is consistent with non-fundamental fluctuations in activity, resulting from
local indeterminacy of degree 1. The intuition for such non-fundamental fluctuations may
be summarized as follows. Assume first that the labour supply is fixed. Moreover, assume
that inflation is expected to be above target, triggering an expected rise in the real interest
rate under active monetary policy. Via arbitrage this implies that the rental rate on capital
19 This statement is subject to the caveat expressed in Footnote 10.
20 There is a separate discussion in the literature of how to equip non-Ricardian consumers ( > 0) with
an endogenous labour supply, as discussed, in particular, by Ascari and Rankin (2004). Since we go in the
main part of the analysis with the model of Blanchard (1985), this discussion does not affect our paper.
21 Alternative mechanisms challenging the logic of the Taylor principle are discussed, among others, in
Benhabib et al. (2001a), Carlstrom and Fuerst (2001), and Gali et al. (2004).

needs to rise as well. This in turn requires, for a predetermined level of the capital stock
and a fixed labour supply, a lower mark-up charged in the final goods sector. This channel
is on impact expansionary, and the associated rise in actual inflation may well become
self-fulfilling under a consumption profile that follows on impact a rising path (supported
by an increase in investment and output), before gradually returning to the initial steady
state.22 By contrast, if monetary policy is passive, such self-fulfilling expectations can
never be validated, leading to locally determinate dynamics.
The assumption of an elastic labour supply reinforces this logic since self-fulfilling increases
in the inflation rate and the real interest rate under active monetary policy can now
be supported through a second margin, namely an increase in the labour supply. To
substantiate this claim, we replace (1) by the more general utility function
EtUj =

where nj
s  (0, 1) denotes the flexible level of individual labour supply and  > 0 denotes
the coefficient of relative risk aversion to variations in leisure. Accordingly, individual
labour supply satisfies the first-order condition nj
s = 1 - (cj
s/ws)1/. Compared with the
previously derived set of aggregate equilibrium conditions (10)-(20), the assumption of
(38) leads to three straightforward modifications, on top of imposing  = 0. First, the
aggregate labour-supply relationship
nt = 1 - (
ct
wt
) 1
 (39)
acts as an additional equilibrium condition in order to pin down nt  (0, 1). Moreover,
the two conditions

and

wt

(41)
replace (15) and (16), respectively.23 Similar to the analysis in Section 4.1, the new set of
aggregate equilibrium conditions gives rise to a unique steady state which is characterized
by the modified golden rule r(k/n) = , as summarized in Appendix 4. For the sake of a
compact notation, let
 = 
n
1 - n
> 0
denote the inverse of the Frisch elasticity of the labour supply with respect to the real
wage. Then, as derived in Appendix 4, local dynamics around the unique steady state are
22 The fact that a self-fulfilling burst in inflation comes together with an increase in the real interest
rate may be intuitively classified as a dominance of supply-side over demand-side effects. However, any
equilibrium sequence must always be consistent with both the demand side and the supply side of the
economy.
23 Moreover, (21) generalizes to yt

, without affecting, however, the residual role
of this identity.

implies that Propositions 1 and 2 remain unchanged if preferences allow for an elastic

Finally, to link the analysis of this Section explicitly to Dupor (2001), consider the par-
ticularly tractable case of a linear labour supply, as given by   0. Then, since 1

and the sign pattern of all entries of (43) is identical to the matrix investigated in detail
by Dupor (2001, p. 92). Since the dynamics of c and  are independent of the capital
stock dynamics, one eigenvalue of the 3x3-dynamics can be directly read off from (43),
i.e.  = y

25 Numerically, the critical value q will be different, but this does not affect the nature of Propositions 1

Calvo contracts. This difference, however, does not affect the qualitative reduced-form feature of separable
capital stock dynamics under a linear labour supply.
22
link between the real interest rate and the return on physical capital in continuous time
models.27
However, the failure of the Taylor principle in models with capital stock dynamics is not
a generic feature of discrete time models, as shown by Carlstrom and Fuerst (2005).28
Intuitively, discrete time models allow for a natural distinction between the marginal
productivity of `today' and of the `future'. If one relates the real interest rate to the
future marginal productivity of capital this essentially removes the binding restriction on
the return rates which causes the failure of the Taylor principle in continuous time.29 It
is for this reason that we emphasized early on that our paper does not give new insights
on the role of the Taylor principle per se. However, our result that the nature of local
determinacy requirements varies with the target level of government debt is likely to be
a robust result in models which include capital and non-Ricardian consumers even if we
introduce mechanisms for reinstating the Taylor principle in versions of the model which
ignore fiscal policy.
6 Conclusion
This paper starts out from the observation that in the New Keynesian paradigm fiscal
policy traditionally plays no prominent role. While monetary policy rules, typically spec-
ified as interest rate rules with feedbacks to endogenous variables like inflation or output,
have been analyzed in great analytical detail, there is no similarly rich literature on the
appropriate use of fiscal instruments. It is well understood that this asymmetric treatment
is adequate in models in which fiscal policy acts through variations in lump-sum taxes in
an environment of Ricardian equivalence, ensuring that the joint design problem of mone-
tary and fiscal policy-making essentially reduces to two separable problems which can be
recursively addressed. The main contribution of this paper is to show within a simple and
tractable framework how this logic needs to be modified in an environment which departs
from Ricardian equivalence, implying that equilibrium dynamics are driven by a genuine
interaction of monetary and fiscal policy.
To this end, we develop a New Keynesian version of the model of Blanchard (1985) in
which, assuming that all taxation is lump-sum, departures from Ricardian equivalence
can be conveniently modelled through a change in the probability of death of consumers.
27 Related to this, see also the discussion of the Taylor principle after Proposition 6 in Benhabib et al.
(2001b). In particular, the paper points out that the Taylor principle becomes fragile if the sign of the
derivative of d with respect to  is ambiguous because of feedbacks between the nominal interest rate
and production. Notice that in our paper this derivate is given by the term  -( +)[1- 1
1+
] fM
+
, and
the ambiguity of the sign of this term arises because changes in the interest rate (in response to inflation
changes) affect marginal costs of firms.
28 Similarly, see Li (2002). Moreover, Lubik (2003), also using a discrete time specification, shows that
the effects of capital stock dynamics in this context depend critically on the degree of strucural distortions
in the economy.
29 In line with this reasoning, Annicchiarico et al. (2005), using a discrete time version of Blanchard
(1985), discuss monetary and fiscal interactions by means of stochastic simulations in which the Taylor-
principle plays a significant role. However, the paper does not discuss the role of government debt in a
systematic way.
23
If this probability is strictly positive (i.e. if consumers are `non-Ricardian'), Ricardian
equivalence ceases to hold and government debt turns into a relevant state variable which
needs to be accounted for in the analysis of local equilibrium dynamics. Assuming simple
policy feedback rules in the spirit of Leeper (1991), our analysis of local steady-state dy-
namics shows that there exist, depending on the assumed target level of government debt,
two qualitatively distinct regimes characterized by `low' and `high' steady-state levels of
debt. These regimes arise since wealth effects of government debt in the Euler equation
lead to non-trivial demand and supply effects, which interact differently at different levels
of steady-state debt and which are related to the endogeneity of the capital stock in the
model of Blanchard. Specifically, our model implies that in the high (low) debt regime
the degree of fiscal discipline, which is needed to ensure locally determinate dynamics,
increases (decreases) if monetary policy becomes more active. More generally speaking,
this leads to the conclusion that, if fiscal policy is non-neutral, meaningful characteriza-
tions of monetary and fiscal stabilization policies are conditional on the prevailing regime
of the target level of government debt. If this dependence is not made explicit, policy
recommendations may well be misleading.
These rich findings contrast strongly with an environment populated by `Ricardian' con-
sumers, characterized by a zero probability of death. Under this assumption, the wealth ef-
fect of government debt in the Euler equation vanishes and the economy converges against
a Ramsey-economy characterized by Ricardian equivalence. Consequently, government
debt is no longer an informative state variable and local steady-state dynamics can be
assessed without reference to the target level of government debt.

Appendix 2: Linearized inflation dynamics
To establish equation (29) used in the main text we proceed in three steps. First, starting
out from (18), the evolution of optimally adjusted prices p(z)t can be approximated to the
first order as
d
p(z)t
=
p(z)t
- p(z)
p(z)
=
Z

t
(r + )[b

Differentiating this expression with respect to time, using the Leibnitz rule, gives
d d
p(z)t
= (r + )( d
p(z)t
- b
pt - d
MCt).
25
Second, the evolution of the aggregate price level (19) can be approximated as
b
pt =
pt - p
p

 d

Note that db
pt =

pt

pt  dt. Differentiating b
pt with respect to time gives
db
pt  t = ( d
p(z)t
- b
pt),
i.e. inflation will be positive whenever `newly adjusted prices rise relatively more strongly
than average prices'. As regards changes in inflation, inflation accelerates (dt = ·
t > 0)
whenever the `inflation rate of newly set prices' (d d
p(z)t
) exceeds the (average) inflation
rate (db
pt = t), with dt given by
dt = [(r + )( d
p(z)t
- b
pt - d
MCt) - ( d
p(z)t
- b
pt)] = rt - (r + ) d
MCt. (45)

As referred to in the main text, the determinant of the matrix J in (30) is given by

signs of 0 and 1 are a priori ambiguous. Consider the situation of a balanced primary
budget with  = g  b = 0. Then, 0|

rises in , since both r and y

, i.e. 1 = -2 < 0. This implies that as  rises from g to  there exist
by continuity three distinct qualitative patterns of
Det(J) = 0  fF = r(1 +
2fM
0 + 1fM
)
characterized by
(a)   (g, 1)  b  (0, b1) : 0 < 0, 1 > 0, 2 > 0;
(b)   (1, )  b  (b1, b) : 0 > 0, 1 > 0, 2 > 0;
(c)   (, )  b  (b, b) : 0 > 0, 1 < 0, 2 > 0,
with representations as shown in Figures 3(a) - (c).
As regards the sufficient condition for determinacy, note that
Det(J) > 0, Tr(J) < 0
implies that eigenvalues must follow the pattern 1 > 0, 2 > 0, 3 < 0, 4 < 0 or,
alternatively, 1 < 0, 2 < 0, 3 < 0, 4 < 0. However, the structure of J in (30) is such
that the second pattern of four negative eigenvalues can never occur. To prove this, we
invoke the `quasi-negative definiteness' criterion as stated, for example, in Gandolfo (1996,
p.252) which calls for forming the matrix B = (J + J0)/2, i.e.
B =

A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for all four eigenvalues of J to be negative is
that the leading minors of B alternate in sign, beginning with minus. In our case, the
first leading minor will only be negative if r < fF . However, this implies, since r > , that
the second leading minor must also be negative, ruling out the possibility of four negative
eigenvalues. Hence, Det(J) > 0, Tr(J) < 0 implies 1 > 0, 2 > 0, 3 < 0, 4 < 0. ¤
Appendix 4: Endogenous labour supply of Ricardian consumers ( = 0)
a) Steady state discussion
Extending the analysis in Section 3.1, w and r are now a function of the capital intensity
(k/n), i.e.
w =
 - 1

(
k
n
)1- = w(
k
n
) and r =
 - 1

(1 - )(
k
n
)- -  = r(
k
n
).
27
Assuming  = 0, the aggregate consumer Euler equation (10) implies r(k/n) = , i.e. the
steady-state capital intensity and the two factor prices w and r are uniquely pinned down
by . The two remaining steady-state relationships are given by the aggregate resource
constraint
c = nk1- - k - g = n[(
k
n
)1- - 
k
n
] - g
and the labour supply condition
n = 1 - (
c
w
) 1
  c = w(1 - n).
With w and k/n being fixed by , these two equations have two unknowns, i.e. c and n.
Combining the two equations yields an expression in n, i.e.
w(1 - n) = n[(
k
n
)1- - 
k
n
] - g.
Consider n  (0, 1). Then, the LHS falls continuously in n, while the RHS rises continuously
in n, i.e. for appropriate values of g there exists a unique steady state with positive activity
levels.
b) Derivation of the transition matrix J in equation (42)
Notice that the first two rows of (42), describing the dynamics of b
bt and b

as in (31).
