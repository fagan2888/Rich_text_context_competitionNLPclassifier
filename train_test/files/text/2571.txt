Abstract
Background: Due to the absence of a current and validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for use in New
Zealand adolescents, there is a need to develop one as a cost-effective way to assess adolescents' food patterns.
This study aims to examine the test-retest reliability and relative validity of the New Zealand Adolescent FFQ
(NZAFFQ) to assess food group intake in adolescents aged 14 to 18 years.
Methods: A non-quantitative (without portion size), 72-item FFQ was developed and pretested. Fifty-two
participants (aged 14.9 ± 0.8 years) completed the NZAFFQ twice within a two-week period for test-retest reliability.
Forty-one participants (aged 15.1 ± 0.9 years) completed a four-day estimated food record (4DFR) in addition to the
FFQs to enable assessment of validity. Spearman's correlations and cross-classification analyses were used to
examine relative validity while intra-class correlations were additionally used for test-retest reliability.
Results: Weekly intakes were estimated for each food item and aggregated into 34 food groups. The median
Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC) between FFQ administrations was 0.71. SCCs ranged from 0.46 for fruit juice
or cordial to 0.87 for non-standard milk. The median intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between FFQ
administrations was 0.69. The median SCC between food groups from the FFQ and the 4DFR was 0.40 with the
highest SCC seen for standard milk (0.70). The exact agreement between the methods in ranking participants into
thirds was highest for meat alternatives (78%), but lowest for red or yellow vegetables and potatoes (27%). The mean
percent of participants misclassified into extreme thirds for food group intake was 12%.
Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the NZAFFQ exhibited good to excellent short-term test-retest reliability
and reasonable validity in ranking the majority of the food group intakes among adolescents aged 14 to 18 years.
The comparability of the validity to that in the current literature suggests that the NZAFFQ may be used among
adolescent New Zealanders to identify dietary patterns and rank them according to food group intake.

Background
The diet of adolescents, which is long known to be im-
portant for their growth and development, is now recog-
nized as also important to their future health [1]. It is a
major modifiable risk factor in the prevention of obesity
and development of chronic diseases such as cardiovas-
cular disease and cancer in adulthood [2,3]. The diet of
adolescents in Western countries has been frequently
described as being poor, with low consumption of dairy,
fruits, vegetables and grains and high consumption of
soft drinks and sweets [4-8]. Taken together, these issues
heighten the need to accurately and reliably assess the
food intake of adolescents, so as to allow for assessment
of dietary patterns and diet quality in relation to future
education and intervention. In order to do this appropri-
ate methods for collecting dietary information from ado-
lescents are needed. In New Zealand, information on the
dietary intakes of adolescents has been collected in na-
tional surveys using in-depth measures such as a 24-hour
dietary recall in combination with a food frequency

questionnaire which had been tested for repeatability only
[9]. However, the cost of such methods makes them
prohibitive for use in all large scale studies. Therefore
other suitable methods of obtaining dietary information
from New Zealand adolescents are needed.
Considerations must be made when selecting appro-
priate dietary assessment methods for adolescents. Al-
though most adolescents possess the literacy skills
necessary for reliable self-reporting, accuracy of dietary
assessment in this age group is affected by factors such
as motivation to complete assessments and reporting
bias associated with unstructured eating patterns, con-
cerns with body image and weight status [10-12]. Besides
these adolescent-specific issues, the study design, out-
comes of interest and available resources need to be
taken into consideration when selecting an appropriate
dietary assessment tool for a study [13,14].
Food frequency questionnaires (FFQs), being relatively
easy to administer and less onerous than other dietary
assessment methods, appear to be a practical and afford-
able method for studying diets of adolescents [15]. They
have been used successfully in large population studies
and have been found to be valid and reliable tools for
ranking food intakes of adolescents [16-18]. The major
limitation of an FFQ lies in the measurement errors per-
taining to an incomplete food list and inaccuracies in
frequency and portion size estimation. In particular, the
complex cognitive process of portion size estimation
may pose additional challenges to adolescents who con-
sume varying portion sizes across meals [19] and are less
likely to pay attention to portion sizes than adults [10].
Although quantification skills may improve with inten-
sive training and the use of age-appropriate food photo-
graph aids [20,21], inclusion of portion size questions in
an FFQ may increase respondent burden and lead to
data omission, and hence contribute only marginally be-
yond frequency data in improving validity of an FFQ
[22,23]. Therefore, recent research in this area has fo-
cused on the development of non-quantitative FFQs
(without collection of portion size information) as tar-
geted dietary assessment tools to rank individuals by in-
take of specific food groups, nutrients or dietary
patterns rather than providing absolute values for foods
and/or nutrients [13,24]. Besides providing information
on usual intakes of a particular food or food groups of
interest, such FFQs are particularly useful in identifying
dietary patterns at the population level [25,26].
In addition to considering which type of FFQ (quanti-
tative or non-quantitative) is most useful for a study, it
is vital that any FFQ must be shown to be reliable and
valid for use in the population of interest. An FFQ
should also be designed to meet the aims of specific
study populations and contain an up-to-date list of foods
[27]. Although some FFQs exist for use in adolescents
[18,28], they contain extensive food lists (more than 100
items) and portion size questions, which may not be
relevant to the New Zealand context.
As there is currently no reliable, valid and up to date
FFQ for use in New Zealand adolescents the aims of this
study were to: (i) adapt an FFQ to assess food group
intakes in New Zealand adolescents aged 14 to 18 years
for use in future studies; (ii) determine short-term reli-
ability of this FFQ, and (iii) determine the relative valid-
ity of this FFQ compared to an estimated food record.
Methods
Development of the New Zealand Adolescent FFQ
(NZAFFQ)
This study was approved by the University of Otago
Human Ethics Committee. A paper-based, three section
adolescent-specific food questionnaire was developed.
The food questionnaire is made up of three sections:
The first section contains 12 multiple-choice questions
on general eating habits, including intakes of food group
servings, meal consumption patterns and frequency of
takeaway consumption. These questions were adapted
from previously published questionnaires [29,30]. This
study focusses on the validity of the FFQ (sections 2 and
3 of the food questionnaire), namely the New Zealand
Adolescent FFQ (NZAFFQ).
The NZAFFQ was produced by combining and modi-
fying the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children
(HBSC) FFQ [24] and the Children's Dietary Question-
naire (CDQ) [26]. These FFQs were developed to de-
scribe food patterns, but not nutrient intakes, of
children and adolescents (4 to 16 years), and therefore
contain only a limited list of food items. In particular,
the HBSC FFQ included 15 items covering the most
commonly consumed foods known to be important
sources of fibre and calcium among European youth.
The CDQ included 28 items described as `encouraged
foods' (fruits, vegetables, water, reduced fat products)
and `discouraged foods' (high fat or sugar foods, swee-
tened beverages and full fat dairy products) for adoles-
cents in Australia. These two validated questionnaires
formed the basic construct of the NZAFFQ as they cov-
ered different important aspects (i.e. variety and intake
frequency) of an adolescent's diet and have been used to
derive index-based dietary patterns [26,31,32].
Section 2 of the food questionnaire assessed `usual con-
sumption' of 32 food items, covering 15 items from the
HBSC FFQ [24] and included extra questions on food
groups relevant to the New Zealand adolescent popula-
tion. Changes to the original HBSC FFQ included the
addition of questions on consumption of meats and differ-
ent types of soft drinks. As in the original HBSC FFQ, fre-
quency of intake was estimated by asking "On average,
how many times a week do you usually eat or drink. . .. . ."

and participants could select one of the following re-
sponse categories: `none', `less than once a week', `once
per week', `2 to 4 days a week', `5 to 6 days a week', `once a
day', and `more than once a day'. Although a specific
time frame for `usual' was not defined, we believed that
this was likely to cover the period of the previous four
weeks, based on results of our pretesting group inter-
views. For the last section of the NZAFFQ (Section 3),
we assessed intakes of 13 fruits, 22 vegetables and 7
miscellaneous foods consumed in the past seven days,
as in the original CDQ [26]. Modifications to the ori-
ginal format included renaming and regrouping of con-
ceptually similar food items to ensure the suitability of
the food items to New Zealand. For example, `sweet po-
tato' was renamed as the locally known Mori name `ku-
mara' while `orange' and `mandarin' were grouped together
as one item. Section 3 assessed `most current intake'
(in the past week) to reduce the difficulty of recall and
accommodate seasonality and availability of foods [33].
Further revisions were also made to ensure that the
food lists in sections 2 and 3 covered the foods fre-
quently consumed in New Zealand including those indi-
cated in the 2002 National Children's Nutrition Survey
[9]. To improve face validity of the NZAFFQ, two regis-
tered dietitians and a nutritionist were consulted to re-
view this FFQ before formal pretesting.
Pretesting of the NZAFFQ in group interviews
The NZAFFQ was pre-tested in a sample of 29 adoles-
cents (13 males, 16 females) aged 14 to 15 years
recruited from one secondary school in Dunedin, Otago.
The day before the pretesting, participants were asked to
complete the FFQs and answer feedback questionnaires
about their comprehension of the NZAFFQ questions.
Two group interviews (one for males, one for females)
were conducted, each moderated by a trained research
assistant, with additional observers present to identify
further discussion questions based on feedback from the
group. The main focus of the group interview was to ob-
tain details on the participants' understanding of the
questions, the food items listed and examples. The
group discussions were audio recorded and transcribed
so that the feedback could be used to further refine the
FFQ. The final NZAFFQ included 74 food items as ei-
ther (i) single foods (e.g. yoghurt), or (ii) lists of similar
foods (e.g. chicken, turkey or duck). For analysis, these
foods were subsequently aggregated into 34 food groups
of interest by grouping similar items as had been done
in other studies [34,35] (Table 1).
Validation of the NZAFFQ
A convenience sample of adolescents aged 14 to 18 years
was recruited to participate in the validation study via
schools, sports clubs and youth groups in Dunedin based
on the following inclusion criteria: aged between 14 and
18 years, absence of any disease that may influence nu-
tritional status, ability to keep a food record, and those
whose parents did not complete an opt-out consent
form. All participants also provided written informed
consent before participating in the study. Data collection
was conducted in two periods from November to early
December 2010 and March to May 2011.
NZAFFQ and estimated food record
Each participant was asked to keep a four-day estimated
food record (4DFR) and complete the NZAFFQ twice
within a fortnight. On the first visit day, each participant
was asked to self-complete an FFQ in the presence of a
research assistant. After the FFQs were checked for
completeness and missing answers were obtained, parti-
cipants were given verbal and written instructions on
how to complete a structured Food and Drink diary for
three weekdays and one weekend day. To facilitate ac-
curate recording, the instructions incorporated standar-
dized examples on the methods of recording and the
food record was structured into six daily eating occa-
sions. On each page, spaces were provided for recording
of meal times, venue, whom the participants ate with,
details of foods consumed including type, brand and
amount of foods or beverages consumed. In addition,
each participant was taught to use the portion aid kit
provided for recording food quantities. The portion aid
kit included a metric measuring cup, ruler, diameter cir-
cle and a coloured food photo booklet, which contained
photographs of commonly consumed foods in different
portion sizes [36]. At the end of the four-day record,
participants answered supplementary questions on the
type of sweetened drink, milk, bread and fat spread that
they usually consumed. This qualitative information was
collected to assist with coding of the food records. All
food records received were checked for completeness.
Participants were asked to clarify missing and unclear
entries whenever possible. Within two weeks after the
first completion of the NZAFFQ, all participants were
asked to repeat the NZAFFQ for a second time to assess
test-retest reliability. Based on results of previous re-
search of FFQ repeatability conducted in New Zealand
children [37], this two-week interval was chosen in order
to minimize the variation in food intake responses due
to true changes over time.
Data and statistical analysis
All data were entered into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet
and checked by a trained nutritionist. Recorded food
items in the 4DFR were matched to the items as defined
by the NZAFFQ. An example of this was `hash browns'
from the 4DFR assigned to `fried potatoes' in the
NZAFFQ. Food items within a composite meal were

each allocated a proportion of the meal then assigned to
their relevant food or food groups. For instance, a
chicken burger was recorded to the three corresponding
foods in the NZAFFQ: white bread/bun, poultry and let-
tuce/salad greens. All frequencies obtained from the
4DFR were adjusted to provide average weekly intakes.
Food intakes were described as frequencies of intake
(days per week) and used as the unit of comparison be-
tween the NZAFFQ and the 4DFR.
Spearman's rank correlations were performed to evalu-
ate the validity of the first FFQ administration
(FFQtime1) relative to the 4DFR for ranking participants
by frequency of consumption of the 34 food groups. Fol-
lowing grouping of participants into thirds, cross-
classification analyses were undertaken to examine the
proportion of participants correctly classified into the
same thirds or grossly misclassified into extreme thirds
of intake. For reliability (FFQtime1 vs. FFQtime2), intra-
class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated in
addition to Spearman's correlation analyses. Because
ICCs take account of within- and between-subject vari-
ability in responses, it was deemed the most appropriate
test to examine the agreement between the repeated
FFQs in ranking individuals by food group intakes. All
statistical analyses were performed using the statistical
program STATA 11.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX,
USA). Significance levels for all tests were set at p < 0.05.
Results
Sample
Of the 78 participants who volunteered to take part in
this study, 38 (49%) participants completed both the
4DFR and two replications of the NZAFFQ. Fourteen
participants (18%) completed two NZAFFQs only while
three participants (4%) completed the 4DFR and the
FFQtime1. More males than females did not complete
all parts of this study (p = 0.006) but there were no dif-
ferences in demographic or anthropometric data be-
tween those who completed all parts of the study and
those who did not (data not shown). In total, 41 partici-
pants (16 males, 25 females) were included in the valid-
ity study while 52 participants (28 males, 24 females)

were included in the reliability study. Participants were
aged 15.0 ± 0.8 years (range 14.0 to 17.9 years). The
mean time interval between test-retest administrations
of the NZAFFQ was 12 days.
Test-retest reliability (FFQtime1 vs. FFQtime2)
The median Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC) be-
tween the two administrations of the NZAFFQ was 0.71,
and SCCs ranged from 0.46 for fruit juice or cordial to
0.87 for non-standard milk (Table 2). The median ICC
was 0.69 (range 0.26-0.92) and 71% (24 of 34) of the
food groups had ICCs above 0.6. At least 46% of partici-
pants were correctly classified into the same thirds for
all food groups. No food groups had levels of gross mis-
classification above 10 percent, with the exception of
meat alternatives (17%) and rice, pasta or noodles (25%).
Relative validity (FFQtime1 vs. 4DFR)
As shown in Table 2, SCCs above 0.3 were seen for over
two-thirds (23) of the 34 food groups in the FFQ. The
median SCC was 0.40, and individual SCCs ranged from
0.04 for convenience foods to 0.70 for standard milk
(whole-fat milk). High correlations (SCC  0.50) were
observed for breakfast cereals, milk (standard and non-
standard), eggs, sweet bakery products and sweet snack
bars. Overall, the exact agreement between the methods
in ranking participants into thirds was highest for meat
alternatives (78%), but lowest for red or yellow vegetables
and potatoes (27%). The mean percent misclassified into
extreme thirds for all food groups was 12%.
Discussion
In the present study, the short-term reliability of a non-
quantitative FFQ (NZAFFQ) was established by compar-
ing two administrations of the FFQ over a two-week
period while relative validity was established against a
4DFR.
The results of this study demonstrated that the
NZAFFQ yielded good test-retest reliability. The median
ICC of 0.69 (range 0.26-0.92) compared favorably to
those reported in previous studies in adolescent popula-
tions (ICC range 0.01-0.83) [38-40]. The median SCC
was 0.71, with all food groups achieving Spearman's cor-
relations above 0.46. This reliability fell within a range
considered good for an FFQ (0.50­0.80) [27,41] and was
similar to the reliability of the CNS02 FFQ, the only pre-
vious FFQ designed for New Zealand children [37]. The
median test-retest correlation for the CNS02 FFQ for
food servings was 0.73, ranging from 0.54 for mixed meat
dishes to 0.89 for convenience meals in the 10­14 year
age group (n = 42). As indicated by the ICC, we found
that foods that were consumed regularly (e.g. milky or
chocolate drinks) were recalled with more consistency
than foods that were consumed occasionally or variably
(e.g. red meat, processed meats and poultry), as observed
in previous studies [17,42,43]. We acknowledge that the
two-week interval between the administration of the
NZAFFQs may have led to overestimation of the reliability
of this FFQ.
Some variation was seen in the levels of validity be-
tween food groups. Among 34 food groups, most food
groups (67%) yielded SCCs between 0.32 and 0.70 while
11 food groups produced correlations below 0.30. In
particular, the NZAFFQ was less accurate in estimating
the group intakes of some vegetables (cruciferous, green
leafy, red or yellow vegetables and potatoes), fruits and
red meat and processed meat. There are several possible
explanations for this observed poor validity for these
food groups.
Firstly, within-participant intakes of fruits, vegetables
and meats were shown to be highly variable [44]. It is
therefore possible that some of the food items consumed
occasionally or episodically were not being consumed
during the four-day recording period. This is a known
limitation when a reference method that covers only a
limited period of time is used to validate an FFQ [45].
Notably, 64% of vegetables, 85% of fruits and 64% of
meat groups were consumed `once a week or less' by
more than two-thirds of the participants. These foods
each had a 54% chance of not being consumed during
the recording period. Although extending the number of
recording days may potentially improve the correlations,
this would have caused reporting fatigue and reduced
the quality and completion of the food records [19].
Secondly, we noted that different recording methods
and time frame might have attenuated the correlations
between the NZAFFQ and the 4DFR. For the NZAFFQ,
a particular food eaten both alone and in mixed dishes
was recorded in a combined frequency. Conversely for
the 4DFR, mixed dishes were recorded then segregated
into their component foods and apportioned to their
matching food groups. Because of this, foods often con-
sumed as part of mixed dishes such as red or yellow
vegetables (e.g. tomatoes and capsicum), red meat and
processed meat (e.g. sausage) may either be forgotten
(thus underestimated in the NZAFFQ) or miscoded in
the food records due to insufficient information [7,46].
In addition, following recommendations by Cade and
colleagues [27], the FFQtime1 was administered before
the 4DFR to eliminate learning effects from completion
of a more onerous dietary method. As the NZAFFQ
asked about `past seven days' intakes for fruits and vege-
tables (in Section 3), it assessed diet retrospectively over
a slightly different time span from the reference method.
These issues of methodological difference between the
two dietary methods (i.e. coding decisions and reference
period) may have had a negative impact on the correla-
tions of the food group intakes. It is also important to

could potentially result in an underestimation of validity.
Comparison with other studies
Although validation studies of FFQs in adolescents have
been previously reported, most studies validated their
FFQs in terms of nutrients or absolute food intakes
[47,48]. Since this study focused on validating the actual
responses of intake frequency, precise comparisons of
this study with existing studies are not possible. One ex-
ception is a study by Vereecken and Maes [24], which
validated a 15-item HBSC FFQ against a 7-day food
diary using a similar approach to this study. These same
15 food items were included in the present NZAFFQ. A
direct comparison of the two studies revealed that the
NZAFFQ showed similar reliability (mean SCC = 0.71)
compared to the original HBSC FFQ validation study
(mean SCC = 0.67) for the 15 food items. Likewise, the
validity of most food items was comparable to those of
the original HBSC FFQ (mean SCC = 0.41), achieving an
average SCC of 0.38. Vereecken and Maes found high
correlations for milk (whole and semi-skimmed) and
brown bread (SCC = 0.51-0.65) but low correlations for
crisps, diet soft drinks, sweets and fruits (SCC = 0.10­0.34).
Similarly, our study showed that validity was good for milk
and breakfast cereals (SCC = 0.59-0.70), but less favorable
for soft drinks (regular and diet), chips, crisps and sweets
(SCC = 0.06-0.30). The most striking observation that
emerged from the data comparison was the rather low
validity for foods perceived as being `less healthy'. We
speculate that these foods may be underreported in the
NZAFFQ due to social undesirability [49]. This is evident
for regular soft drinks where 50% of participants who
reported usual consumption of `once or less per week' in
the NZAFFQ specified intake on two or more days during
their 4-day recording periods.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths and limitations. The main
limitation of this study was the small sample size (n =41),
which may have limited the observation of significant cor-
relations in food group intakes. Previous authors have sug-
gested that a sample size of at least 50 is desirable [27], and
ideally a sample of between 100 and 200 should be used,
particularly if the FFQ is designed to provide information
on nutrient intakes [41]. Although the recruitment dead-
lines were shifted several times, it was difficult to recruit
more participants. A high percent (47%) of those recruited
failed to complete the study due to the demanding task of
keeping a 4DFR, even though estimated rather than
weighed records were used. Our low compliance rate fell
within the response range of 48% to 60% typically observed
in previous validation studies of adolescents [19,50,51]. The
sample in our study may comprise participants who were
highly motivated; hence generalizability of these findings to
other adolescent populations in New Zealand may be lim-
ited. On the other hand, this reinforces the clear need to
develop a simple FFQ to accurately assess diet among ado-
lescents, including those who are unlikely to provide high
quality food records.
In the absence of an absolute gold standard for dietary
assessment, we chose an estimated food record as the
reference method. This method is advantageous in its
ability to capture all food intakes without the reliance of
memory and hence has the fewest correlated errors with
an FFQ [52]. Additional effort was taken to prepare the
Food and Drink Diary as an easy-to-carry booklet to fa-
cilitate recording `in situ'. Although participants were
instructed to conduct recording `at the time' of food and
beverage consumption, we acknowledge that this may
not be entirely possible. Food underestimation may still
occur due to forgetfulness and the limited food know-
ledge among adolescents [47,53,54]. In addition, as the
present NZAFFQ also assesses food intakes in the past,
the different time frame between the FFQs and the food
records may have had an effect on the correlations.
Nevertheless, we found similar correlations between this
study and other studies with overlapped time frame
[38,39,44].
The strength of this study lies in the design of a non-
quantitative FFQ, which is relatively short and practical
for use in time-limited surveys where detailed measures
of food intakes are not feasible. We attempted to address
the limited motivation and portion size estimation skills
among adolescents by omitting the requirement to pro-
vide food quantities in the NZAFFQ. As a result, this
FFQ was highly repeatable and could be self-completed
within 15 minutes. The median SCC of 0.40 obtained
from this study was comparable to other validation stud-
ies of quantitative FFQs in adolescent populations
[38,44,50]. Encompassing a wide range of food items
from different food groups, this FFQ may offer a viable
approach to measure diet diversity and derive dietary
patterns or diet quality indices in large studies of adoles-
cents. Whilst the intended use of the NZAFFQ is to as-
sess food group intakes of adolescents in New Zealand,
there is a potential for the frequency data to be used
alongside other more intensive dietary assessment meth-
ods such as the 24-hour diet recall to estimate usual in-
take [55]. As it was adapted from previously validated
questionnaires and pretested rigorously, we believe that
the food list sufficiently covers the common foods con-
sumed by New Zealand adolescents and is hence suitable
to assess food group intakes in this age group.
Conclusions
Despite a small sample size, the NZAFFQ exhibited
good to excellent test-retest reliability and reasonable

validity in ranking intakes for a majority of the food
groups. This positive finding raises the possibility that
the true ability of the NZAFFQ to rank food intakes in
adolescents is greater than that shown by our data.
Based on the present study, we recommend that the
NZAFFQ is appropriate for ranking participants accord-
ing to food group intake and may be applied in future
studies to assess dietary patterns of adolescents aged 14
to 18 years.
