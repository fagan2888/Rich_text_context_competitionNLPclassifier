Measures of Menopausal Status in Relation to Demographic, Reproductive,
and Behavioral Characteristics in a Population-based Study of Women Aged
35­49 Years
Glinda S. Cooper,1 Donna D. Baird,1 and F. Rebecca Darden2
The purpose of this cross-sectional analysis of women aged 35­49 years from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, conducted between 1988 and 1994, was to assess associations with menopausal
status based either on menstrual cycle patterns or on elevated (>20 IU/liter) follicle-stimulating hormone.
Menstrual cycle-based menopausal status was defined for women who had not had surgical menopause by
months since the last period (<2, 2­12, and >12 months for pre-, peri-, and postmenopause, respectively).
Logistic regression was adjusted for age, smoking, and unilateral oophorectomy. Higher body mass index (30
kg/m2 compared with < 25.0 kg/m2) was associated with a lower likelihood of elevated follicle-stimulating hormone
(odds ratio (OR) = 0.6, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4, 0.9) but this association was not seen with the
menstrual measure of menopause. Exercise (three or more times per week) was associated with a lower
likelihood of being postmenopausal on the basis of menstrual (OR = 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2, 0.7) and hormonal (OR =
0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0) measures. Alcohol use also tended to be associated with postmenopausal status by either
measure, but not significantly so. There was little evidence of associations with ethnicity, education, age at
menarche, number of livebirths, and oral contraceptive use. Menstrual-based definitions of menopause can be
misclassified for women with menstrual irregularity. This might explain why obese women were classified
menstrually as menopausal while remaining hormonally premenopausal. Am J Epidemiol 2001;153:1159­65.

Early natural menopause has been associated with an
increased risk of all-cause (1, 2) and cardiovascular (3) mor-
tality. Age at natural menopause has also been proposed as a
marker of ovarian toxicity for factors that may directly or
indirectly damage the follicular pool (4). Approximately
5­10 percent of women in the United States experience nat-
ural menopause by age 45 years, and the median age at
menopause is approximately 51 years (5). Numerous studies
(6­13), including a 1990 meta-analysis (6), reported an ear-
lier age at natural menopause among current smokers com-
pared with women who had never smoked. An early age at
menopause in women with lower levels of education has
been observed in univariate analyses in many studies, but
this association was not seen when adjustment was made for
smoking and other factors ( 8­11, 13, 14). Increasing parity
was associated with a later age at menopause in most stud-
ies that examined this factor (11, 13­17). Relatively few
studies have examined other factors (e.g., alcohol use, age at
menarche) in relation to age at natural menopause, and there
are inconsistent results among the studies that are currently
available.
Most studies that examine risk factors for menopause
have used self-reported menstrual characteristics to define
menopause. A few (18­20) have used the hormonal marker
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). FSH concentrations
may increase for up to several years before menstrual cycles
cease (21, 22).
We examined the associations between lifestyle, demo-
graphic, and reproductive factors (specifically, body mass
index, exercise, alcohol use, ethnicity, education, age at
menarche, pregnancy history, and oral contraceptive use)
and menopause in women of late reproductive age from a
representative sample of the United States population. The
use of both menstrual and hormonal measures of menopause
allows us to determine consistencies and inconsistencies
between them.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was a national, cross-sectional,
population-based study of 33,994 noninstitutionalized,
civilian persons aged 2 months to 74 years conducted
between 1988 and 1994 by the National Center for Health
Statistics. NHANES III was designed to evaluate the nutri-
1160 Cooper et al.

tional and health statuses of the United States population
and used a stratified, multistage sampling procedure to
select the study sample. Data collection included a stan-
dardized in-person interview, blood sample, physical exam-
ination, and other clinical and laboratory procedures (23).
We selected NHANES III women aged 35­49 (n 
2,205) for study. This age restriction was chosen because we
were interested in factors that affected early menopause.
The reasons for exclusion varied somewhat between the
analysis of menstrual patterns status and FSH (table 1), but
227 women were excluded from both analyses because of
specific medical indications or medication use (bilateral
oophorectomy, current oral contraceptive use, and
menopause related to chemotherapy or radiation) that pre-
cluded assessment of current menstrual periods and FSH
levels. For the analyses of menstrual patterns, 274 women
who had had surgical menopause (hysterectomy) or had an
uncertain menopausal status were excluded. For the FSH
analyses, women who had had a hysterectomy without bilat-
eral oophorectomy were included, but 184 women who were
currently pregnant or breastfeeding or who had missing hor-
mone or oophorectomy data were excluded.
At the time of the blood draw, women were asked, "About
how long ago was your last period," with response cate-
gories: having it now, less than 2, 2­3, 4­6, 7­9, and 10­12
months ago. Women who had not had a period in the previ-
ous 12 months were asked about their age at their last
period. FSH concentrations in postmenopausal women far
exceed those found at any time during the premenopausal
menstrual cycle, but perimenopausal FSH can be similar in
concentration to increases seen at time of ovulation for pre-
menopausal women. Since the blood samples were not
timed to a specific day of the cycle, some samples were
taken around the time of ovulation and could not be used to
assess menopausal status reliably. The rise in luteinizing
hormone is greater than that in FSH around the time of ovu-
lation, with luteinizing hormone-to-FSH ratios of 1.5­2.0 or
higher (24). In contrast, FSH tends to rise before luteinizing
hormone during the premenopausal years, resulting in a
luteinizing hormone-to-FSH ratio of less than 1.0 (21). On
the basis of this information, we excluded 65 women with a
ratio of luteinizing hormone to FSH higher than 2.0 to
reduce the potential influence of increases in FSH that occur
around ovulation.
Use of hormone replacement therapy may present some
difficulties in the classification of menopausal status based on
either menstrual cycles or FSH because of withdrawal bleed-
ing that can occur with progestins and because of a suppres-
sive effect of estrogen on FSH. However, excluding users of
hormone replacement therapy could introduce a selection bias
into the study, and including hormone replacement therapy
use in the logistic regression models could produce attenuated
estimates due to overadjustment of an intermediary variable.
We included 19 women who were currently using hormone
replacement therapy in the analysis of menopause based on
menstrual cycles. Twelve of the women were classified as
postmenopausal (>12 months since the last menstrual period),
and seven were classified as perimenopausal. We also exam-
ined the effect of hormone replacement therapy on FSH by
using the NHANES III data. Among 129 women aged 35­49
years with a bilateral oophorectomy, 85 percent of the women
who were currently using hormone replacement therapy pills
had an FSH that exceeded 20 IU/liter compared with 86 per-
cent of nonusers. However, the prevalence of very high (>40
IU/liter) levels was somewhat lower among hormone replace-
ment therapy users (52 percent compared with 67 percent for
nonusers; odds ratio (OR)  0.5, 95 percent confidence inter-
val (CI): 0.2, 1.3, p  0.13). A cutpoint of 20 IU/liter differ-
entiated between 50 premenopausal and 49 oophorectomized
women in a study by Nordin et al. (25). For these reasons, we
chose to define elevated FSH as above 20 IU/liter, and we
included 59 current users of hormone replacement therapy in
the FSH analysis.
After all exclusions, there were 1,555 premenopausal
women (1,520 who had had a period in the previous 2
months, 19 currently pregnant, and 16 currently breastfeed-

ing), 66 perimenopausal women (2­12 months since the last
menstrual period), and 75 postmenopausal women (>12
months since the last menstrual period), for a total of 1,696
women in the menstrual-cycle analysis. There were 1,721
women in the FSH analysis (1,481 with FSH 20 IU/liter
and 240 with FSH >20 IU/liter).
The interview data collected in NHANES III included
information on age, ethnicity, education, smoking history,
menopausal status, use of birth control pills, use of hormone
replacement therapy, number of pregnancies, and number of
livebirths. Information on alcohol use was obtained from the
food frequency questionnaire that included three questions
about usual consumption over the previous month of beer
and light beer, wine, wine coolers, sangria, champagne, and
hard liquor. An additional question asked about frequency of
binge drinking (nine or more drinks in a day) over the pre-
vious 12 months. Categorization of exercise was based on
the summation of self-reported frequency of eight specific
activities (running/jogging, bicycling, swimming, aerobics,
other dancing, calisthenics, gardening, and lifting weights)
during the previous month. Height and weight were mea-
sured as part of the physical examination and were used to
calculate body mass index (kg/m2). We divided body mass
index based on cutpoints defining obesity that were used in
a previous analysis of National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) data (26).
FSH was measured in NHANES III by using an immuno-
radiometric assay (FSH MAIAclone, Serono Diagnostics,
East Walpole, Massachusetts). The coefficient of variation
was 8.9 percent for low controls and 3.1 percent for high
controls (27).
Logistic regression, fitting generalized logits to model a
three-level, nominal (nonordered) outcome of menopausal
status based on menstrual cycles (premenopause, peri-
menopause, and postnatural menopause), was used for the
analysis. Age (as a continuous variable), current smoking
(yes/no), and unilateral oophorectomy were included in all
models because these were predictors of menopausal status
in other studies (6, 17, 20, 28). Other factors (body mass
index, exercise, alcohol use, ethnicity, education, age at
menarche, parity, and oral contraceptive use) were added to
the model one at a time. We then looked for evidence of con-
founding between these variables by examining the change
in associations when combinations of variables that could be
correlated (e.g., body mass index and exercise; education
and ethnicity; and body mass index, ethnicity, and educa-
tion) were added to the model. We stratified by smoking sta-
tus to examine the possible interaction between smoking
and body mass index. This interaction was reported in a pre-
vious study (7). Results are presented in terms of odds ratios
and 95 percent confidence intervals.
We used logistic regression to analyze the prevalence of
elevated FSH (>20 IU/liter). In addition to age, smoking,
and unilateral oophorectomy, we adjusted for hysterectomy
in this model (20). The analytic strategy was similar to the
process described for the analysis of menstrually based
menopausal status.
We examined the effect of some of our inclusion and exclu-
sion decisions by comparing results with subsets of the data.
For example, we included 35 women who were currently
pregnant or breastfeeding in the analysis of menopausal status
based on menstrual cycles and classified them as pre-
menopausal. There was little difference in the observed asso-
ciations when we excluded these women. We also repeated the
analyses, limiting both sets to the 1,487 women who had FSH
and the menstrually defined measure of menopausal status, to
determine whether any differences in the associations that we
observed could be attributed to differences in the sample. Our
results were similar when using this more limited sample. We
present the results from the larger, more representative sample.
RESULTS
FSH was strongly correlated with the menstrually defined
measure of menopause (figure 1). The proportions with FSH
of at least 20 IU/liter were 6, 50, and 85 percent for the pre-
menopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal groups,
respectively.

Higher body mass index was associated with lower FSH
levels (adjusted OR  0.6 for 30 kg/m2 compared with
<25.0 kg/m2) (table 2). However, the direction of the asso-
ciations with the measures based on menstrual cycle pat-
terns were reversed. Higher body mass was associated with
an increased risk of being peri- or postmenopausal,
although the confidence intervals around these estimates
were wide and included 1.0. Results were similar when
stratified by smoking status, so there was no evidence of
effect modification.

Exercise was associated with a lower likelihood of having
an elevated FSH level or of being postmenopausal as defined
by menstrual cycle patterns (table 2). Similar, but somewhat
weaker, associations were seen with alcohol use. Little asso-
ciation was seen with perimenopausal status with either
exposure. Binge drinking (nine or more drinks per day at
least once during the previous year) was reported by only 5
percent of the study participants. The patterns of association
with binge drinking (OR for being postmenopausal  0.4, 95
percent CI: 0.1, 1.9; OR for elevated FSH  0.8, 95 percent
CI: 0.3, 1.7) were similar to the associations with the alcohol
measure based on drinks per week, but, given the low fre-
quency of this exposure, these are imprecise estimates.
On the basis of menstrually defined menopause, African
Americans had a somewhat increased likelihood of being
postmenopausal and Hispanics were more likely to be peri-
menopausal, but there was little association with the hor-
monally defined menopause measure in either group. There
was little evidence of an association between FSH or men-
strually defined menopausal status and education level,
number of livebirths, or oral contraceptive use. Additional
adjustment for body mass index had little effect on the asso-
ciations with ethnicity or education (data not shown).
Younger age at menarche (10 years) was somewhat associ-
ated with postmenopausal status and with increased FSH
levels, but the estimates were not statistically significant. No
association was seen with later age at menarche.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to identify factors that can
influence the process of ovarian senescence, marked by
missed menses and elevations in FSH. Ovarian senescence
is caused by the final demise of the prenatally determined
pool of follicles. Follicular atresia by apoptosis occurs
throughout a woman's life, and variation in age of
menopause is thought to reflect variation in rates of atresia.
Little is known about the biologic factors controlling atresia.
The menstrual-based measures of menopause allowed us
to identify perimenopause women as a separate group.
However, it does not necessarily follow that factors that
cause early menopause would also affect perimenopause.
Perimenopause, defined by a time of irregular menstrual
cycling before final amenorrhea, may or may not occur. It is
possible for women to have regular cycles up to the time of
their last period, thus skipping a menstrually defined peri-
menopausal interval. An exposure that extended the peri-
menopausal interval but did not result in earlier entry into
menopause would be a risk factor for perimenopause but
might actually reduce the likelihood of menopause.
Therefore, we evaluated menstrually defined peri-
menopause and postmenopause separately rather than as a
single ordinal outcome.
We observed an association between higher body mass
index and reduced risk of being menopausal (OR  0.6), as
defined by a hormonal measure of elevated FSH. However,
the associations with menopausal status based on menstrual
cycle patterns were in the opposite direction (that is, odds
ratios were greater than 1.0). Similar patterns with body
mass index were seen in smokers and nonsmokers. Data
from the Nurses' Health Study suggested that heavier
women had a reduced risk of becoming menstrually post-
menopausal during 2 years of follow-up, but this association
was seen only in smokers (7).
Because obesity is associated with menstrual irregularity
(29, 30), obese premenopausal women may be misclassified
as peri- or postmenopausal. Consistent with this interpreta-
tion, only 37 percent of very obese women (body mass index
30.0 kg/m2) who were classified as perimenopausal based
on menstrual cycle patterns (2­12 months since the last men-
strual period) had an FSH of more than 20 IU/liter compared
with 63 percent of perimenopausal women with a lower body
mass index (OR  0.4, 95 percent: CI: 0.1, 1.0). Comparable
differences were seen with higher FSH values: 27 percent of
the very obese perimenopausal women had FSH values of 40
IU/liter or more compared with 53 percent of thinner peri-
menopausal women (OR  0.3, 95 percent CI: 0.1, 0.9).
Postmenopausal estrogen levels may be higher in obese com-
pared with nonobese women, but still are well below pre-
menopausal levels (31). Whether such a small change in
estrogen could account for the low FSH in obese women
who reported peri- and postmenopausal status is doubtful.
There was an association between exercise frequency and
reduced risk of both hormonal and menstrual menopause in
the NHANES data. This association has not been reported
previously. In our study, younger women (those aged 35­39
years) were somewhat more likely to exercise three or more
times per week than were those aged 40­44 or 45­49 years,
so we repeated the exercise analyses, excluding women
aged 35­39. This exclusion did not appreciably change the
associations we had observed, so we do not think our results
are due to residual confounding by age. Because exercise is
a modifiable behavior, it is important to examine the relation
between it and menopause in additional studies, including
prospective designs that would specifically address exercise
habits antecedent to menopause.
Our analysis suggested an association between alcohol
use and reduced risk of hormonally or menstrually defined
menopause, but the relations were not statistically signifi-
cant. Torgerson et al. (16) reported a reduced risk (OR 
0.5) of menopause with higher alcohol consumption in a
population-based study of 2,073 women aged 45­49 years.
A mechanism for an alcohol effect has not been proposed.
NHANES included a large proportion of African
Americans and Hispanics. Although there was some evi-
dence of increased risk of being postmenopausal based on
menstrual-cycle patterns in African Americans compared
with Whites, this association was not statistically signifi-
cant, and there were no clear associations in Hispanics.
Some other studies have reported an earlier age at
menopause in African Americans (11, 14, 28), but this dif-
ference was statistically significant in only one of the stud-
ies (11). There was no association between education level
and either measure of menopausal status in our analysis.
This finding is similar to those of other studies that adjusted
for smoking ( 8­11, 13, 14).
There was some evidence of an association between
early menarche (age <11 years) and earlier menopause in
1164 Cooper et al.

our study. Data from other studies on this question have
been inconsistent (13­15, 17). We did not observe any pat-
tern with respect to menopausal risk and number of live-
births. Several studies have reported an association
between higher parity and later age at menopause (13­17)
or perimenopause (32), but no association was seen in the
prospective study by Brambilla et al. (9). None of these
studies included analyses that adjusted for body mass
index. Analyses of menopause in relation to oral contra-
ceptive use (11, 14, 17), like those in our analysis, do not
provide evidence for an association.
There are limitations to our study. In analyzing FSH, we
could not control for day of cycle, since information about
the exact date of the last menstrual period was not col-
lected. However, our exclusion of participants with a ratio
of luteinizing hormone to FSH higher than 2.0 should
reduce the likelihood of misinterpreting an ovulation-
related increase in FSH. There is an arbitrary element to
any categorization of a continuous variable, such as we
used with the dichotomous outcome of FSH greater than
20 IU/liter. Cutpoints of 20, 25, 40, and 70 IU/liter have
been used in clinical and epidemiologic studies of ovarian
function and menopause (18, 33­36). We chose 20 IU/liter
because this cutpoint differentiated between 50 pre-
menopausal and 49 oophorectomized women in a study by
Nordin et al. (25) and best allows for inclusion of women
using hormone replacement therapy. These are cross-
sectional data, so some associations could be due to
behavioral changes that might occur with menopause. For
example, if women stopped exercising at menopause, that
could explain data showing that exercise is protective of
menopause.
A strength of our study is that it is a population-based,
relatively large sample of the United States population,
with a substantial number of African Americans and
Hispanics included in the sample. A standardized protocol
was used for the interview. Collection of menstrual cycle
and FSH data allows for analysis of both measures. These
parallel analyses can be very informative, even (or espe-
cially) when results are "discrepant," such as are seen with
the analyses of body mass index. Our analysis highlights
potential problems with the classification of menopausal
status based on menstrual cycle patterns in obese women
or those with other characteristics or exposures that affect
menstrual regularity.
Understanding of the extent to which ovarian senes-
cence is influenced by weight, exercise, alcohol, and other
behavioral or environmental factors can stimulate research
into the mechanisms involved in follicular atresia as
well as identify modifiable exposures that influence
menopause.
