Importance: This study assessed whether stronger school
meal nutrition standards may improve student weight sta-
tus. Results have immediate implications because of the
ongoing implementation of new nutrition standards for
the National School Lunch Program.
Objective: To determine if state laws with stricter school
meal nutrition standards are inversely associated with ado-
lescent weight status, while controlling for unmeasured
state-level confounders.
Design: Quasi-experiment.
Setting: Public schools.
Participants: Four thousand eight hundred seventy
eighth-grade students in 40 states. Students were cat-
egorized by type of school lunch they usually obtained
(free/reduced price, regular price, or none).
Interventions: State laws governing school meal nu-
trition standards. States with standards that exceeded US
Department of Agriculture (USDA) school meal stan-
dards were compared with states that did not exceed USDA
standards. The parameter of interest was the interaction
between state laws and student lunch participant status,
ie, whether disparities in weight status between school
lunch participants and nonparticipants were smaller in
states with stricter standards.
Main Outcome Measures: Body mass index percen-
tile and obesity status.
Results: In states that exceeded USDA standards, the
difference in obesity prevalence between students who
obtained free/reduced-price lunches and students who
did not obtain school lunches was 12.3 percentage
points smaller (95% CI, 21.5 to 3.0) compared with
states that did not exceed USDA standards. Likewise,
differences in mean body mass index percentile between
those student populations were 11 units smaller in states
that exceeded USDA standards (95% CI, 17.7 to
4.3). There was little evidence that students compen-
sated for school meal laws by purchasing more sweets,
salty snacks, or sugar-sweetened beverages from other
school venues (eg, vending machines) or other sources
(eg, fast food).
Conclusions and Relevance: Stringent school meal
standards that reflect the latest nutrition science may
improve weight status among school lunch participants,
particularly those eligible for free/reduced-price
lunches.

THE NATIONAL SCHOOL
LunchProgram(NSLP)was
established in 1946 to im-
prove students' nutritional
intake by providing school
meals in accordance with standards set by
theUSDepartmentofAgriculture(USDA).
Since then, the NSLP has grown to be an
integral component of the diet of school-
agedchildrenthroughouttheUnitedStates.
Onanaveragedayinthe2010-2011school
year, nearly 32 million children in the
United States received NSLP lunches,1 and
the program provides free and reduced-
pricelunchestostudentswhoqualifybased
on their household income.
The program has faced criticism, how-
ever, after several independent studies re-
ported that NSLP lunches did not meet the
USDA nutrient-based standards.2-6 Some
studies also suggested that students' par-
ticipation in the NSLP was positively as-
sociated with weight gain or risk of obe-
sity.7-10 The association between NSLP
participation and obesity is likely due to
selection bias11-13 because the NSLP is in-
herently designed to benefit low-income

children, who are at a higher risk of becoming obese.14
Nonetheless, the NSLP may be a missed opportunity to
improve participants' weight status and reduce the health
consequences of obesity.15
The USDA recently updated school meal nutrition stan-
dards, based on the most recent Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, in accordance with the Child Nutrition and
WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004.16 New standards were
released in January 2012 and include increases in the num-
ber and variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains;
reductions in trans fat content; and limits on calories per
meal.17 Prior to these updates, some states had codified
laws that exceeded previous USDA standards and in-
cluded provisions similar to 2012 standards. Variation
in state laws presents an opportunity to assess whether
updated federal school meal standards have the poten-
tial to reduce childhood obesity or, conversely, if there
are unintended consequences of which schools must be
cognizant.
Estimating the causal effect of state laws is method-
ologically challenging because laws are not randomly as-
signed. As Harper et al18 illustrated in a recent study on
state medical marijuana laws, states with varying laws dif-
fer with respect to unmeasured characteristics that may
bias results if they are associated with the outcome of in-
terest. An example would be states enacting school meal
laws because they have higher obesity prevalence. Clini-
cal epidemiology studies face a similar challenge when
patients are prescribed a treatment because they are sicker,
making it appear as though treatment is associated with
poor health.19 It can create the appearance that interven-
tions have a negative impact unless investigators design
a study to control for such characteristics.
This observational study sought to assess whether state
school meal laws that contained provisions similar to 2012
USDA standards were inversely associated with student
weightstatus.Weusedaquasi-experimentaldesigntocon-
trol for state characteristics that would bias a conven-
tional cross-sectional analysis. We also explored whether
school meal laws were associated with increased consump-
tion of foods and beverages in other venues (eg, school
vending machines), as an unintended consequence. Such
"competitive foods" are not currently subject to NSLP
guidelines, tend to be unhealthy, and have been widely
available in schools.5,6,20 Competitive foods are not tar-
geted by school meal laws but may be indirectly affected
if students compensate for school meal nutrition stan-
dards by obtaining unhealthy foods elsewhere.21,22
METHODS
STATE LAWS
Codified state statutory and administrative (ie, regulatory) laws
governing school meals were compiled as part of the Bridging
the Gap research program.23 Laws were obtained from the West-
law and LexisNexis legal research databases using primary le-
gal research methods, including a combination of Boolean key
word searches of the full text and reviews of the tables of con-
tents and indices of statutory and administrative codes.24 Laws
were double-coded by 2 trained, master-level coders and veri-
fied against secondary-source state law data to ensure com-
plete collection and coding interpretation.25-29 For these vari-
ables, the interrater agreement was 99% accurate; the 1%
discrepancy is for a random miss by 1 reviewer.
For purposes of this study, states were classified based on
whether laws applicable at the middle-school level for the 2006-
2007 school year contained nutrition standards that exceeded
USDA standards at the time (which had not been updated since
1995.) States that exceeded USDA standards did so by encour-
aging or requiring a specific number of fruits/vegetables; that
at least half of all grains sold/served were whole grains; reduc-
tions in products that contain trans fats; and/or restrictions on
milk to 1% or skim milk. These provisions were among the
school meal provisions that the USDA announced in January
2012.17 Examples of laws are provided in the eAppendix (http:
//www.jamapeds.com).
STUDENT SAMPLE
Student data were obtained from the Early Childhood Longi-
tudinal Study, Kindergarten Class (ECLS-K).30 The ECLS-K is
a cohort study that began collecting data from a nationally rep-
resentative sample of kindergarten students in fall 1998 and
studied them through 7 rounds of data collection. The law data
were merged to individual-level ECLS-K data based on state-
level geocode identifiers obtained under special agreement. States
cannot be listed because of data license restrictions. Analyses
in this study used only student data collected in spring 2007,
when most students were in eighth grade, because the law data
represented the 2006-2007 school year. This study was ap-
proved by the institutional review board of the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
Among the 7050 public school students who participated
in ECLS-K in 2007, 2180 were excluded from this study be-
cause their principal reported that no students participated in
lunch programs (n=40), they resided in a state with fewer than
5 observations (n=10), or they were missing data on school
lunch programs (n=150), height or weight (n=440), lunch par-
ticipation (n=770), or covariates (n=770). The study sample
included 4870 students in 40 states. Missing data were equally
common in states with different school meal laws but more com-
mon among boys, racial/ethnic minorities, and students who
resided in urban areas, were of low socioeconomic status (SES),
or were obese (P.05).
The primary outcomes of interest were body mass index
(BMI) percentile and obesity status. Body mass index percen-
tile measures each student's BMI relative to a reference popu-
lation composed of children of the same age and sex in the United
States to account for developmental differences between boys
and girls of different ages.31 Body mass index was calculated
from height and weight data obtained by ECLS-K staff using a
Shorr board and digital scale, respectively (BMI was calcu-
lated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared).
Students were categorized as obese if their BMI was greater than
or equal to the age- and sex-specific 95th percentile of the 2000
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts.31
SURVEY DATA
Other ECLS-K data used in this study were obtained through
interviews with parents/guardians and questionnaires com-
pleted by students in class. Parents reported whether their child
obtained lunch at school and, if so, whether they were eligible
for a free/reduced-price lunch. Parents also reported their edu-
cation, occupation, and household income and their child's race/
ethnicity. Students reported several diet behaviors including
in-school purchasing of sweets, salty snacks, and sugar-
sweetened beverages (SSBs); fast food consumption; and over-

all SSB consumption. Each dietary variable was measured by
asking students to report how many times they purchased/
consumed each food/beverage group in the past week. Several
examples of sweets, salty snacks, and SSBs were provided in
the questionnaire. Students also reported several measures of
physical activity including hours of television watched per day
and days of physical activity in the past week.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
All analyses used generalized estimating equations with an ex-
changeable correlation matrix and identity link to control for
state-level clustering. Analyses were conducted using Stata ver-
sion 11 (StataCorp).
Generalized estimating equation models were designed to
estimate the association between laws and differences in the
outcomes of interest (eg, probability of obesity) between stu-
dents who obtain lunch at school and those who do not, ie, the
parameter of interest was the interaction between state law and
student lunch participant status. We focused on this interac-
tion, not the main effect of state law, for 2 reasons: (1) to as-
sess whether stronger laws are associated with smaller dispari-
ties in weight status between school lunch participants and
nonparticipants and (2) the interaction provides a less biased
estimate of the effect of state laws. As discussed earlier, com-
paring states with laws to states without laws does not provide
a valid estimate of the causal effect due to unmeasured differ-
ences between comparison groups. The interaction between laws
and student lunch participant status, conversely, is less likely
to be confounded by state characteristics such as obesity preva-
lence or competitive food laws that are common to all stu-
dents. Students who do not obtain lunch at school essentially
serve as a secondary control group, or a proxy of what stu-
dents who are exposed to strong laws would have experienced
had they not been exposed, because these 2 groups are other-
wise exposed to many of the same state characteristics.32
Hours of television watched per day and days of physical
activity were included as covariates to control for the possibil-
ity of selection bias, which could occur if healthier school meal
standards attract students who generally engage in healthy
weight-related behaviors. Models also controlled for race/
ethnicity, sex, school locale (suburban vs nonsuburban), and
an SES index that included data on parental education, paren-
tal occupation, and household income.30
As described earlier, a secondary objective was to assess
whether students compensated for stringent school meal stan-
dards by purchasing more foods and beverages from other ven-
ues. All models were reestimated using fast food consump-
tion, SSB consumption, and in-school purchasing of sweets, salty
snacks, and SSBs as outcomes.
RESULTS
Students who received free/reduced-price lunches tended
to be of lower SES, were less likely to be non-Hispanic
white, and were less likely to live in suburban areas than
students who purchased full-price lunches at school or
those who did not obtain lunch at school (Table 1). The
differences between the latter 2 groups were smaller, but
the distribution of SES was slightly higher for students
who did not obtain lunch at school (eg, 37.8% were in
the upper SES quintile, compared with 24.9% of stu-
dents who purchased lunch at school). Students in states
that exceeded USDA standards were more likely to be His-

panic, of a lower SES, and located in suburban areas than
students in states without such laws. States that ex-
ceeded USDA standards had slightly higher mean obe-
sity prevalence (age 10-17 years) and poverty rate but
also had higher median income and higher percentage
of adults with a bachelor degree. The exact number of
states in each category cannot be reported because of data
license restrictions.
Table 2 illustrates the differences between students
of different lunch participant status in dietary behav-
iors, obesity prevalence, and mean BMI percentile. The
unadjusted prevalence of obesity was 11 percentage points
higher among students who obtained free/reduced-
price lunches at school compared with students who did
not obtain lunch at school. The prevalence remained 3.7
percentage points higher (95% CI, 0.0 to 7.5) after con-
trolling for state fixed effects, race/ethnicity, sex, locale,
and SES index. For each in-school purchasing behavior,
the adjusted mean was highest among students who pur-
chased full-price lunches at school, whereas adjusted
means for overall consumption of fast food and SSBs were
highest among students who obtained free/reduced-
price lunches.
The magnitude of differences in weight status be-
tween students of different lunch participant status var-
ied considerably between states with different school meal
laws (Figure). In states that did not exceed USDA stan-
dards, students who obtained free/reduced-price lunches
were almost twice as likely to be obese than students who
did not obtain school lunches (26.0% and 13.9%, respec-
tively), whereas the disparity between groups was mark-
edly reduced in states that exceeded USDA standards
(21.1% and 17.4%, respectively). Negative coefficients
in Table 3 likewise indicate that adjusted differences
in weight status between school lunch participants and
nonparticipants were smaller in states that exceeded USDA
standards. For example, the adjusted difference in obe-
sity prevalence between students who obtained free/
reduced-price lunches and students who did not obtain
lunch at school was 12.3 percentage points lower in states
that exceeded USDA standards (95% CI, 21.5 to 3.0).
Differences in adjusted mean BMI percentile between stu-
dents who obtained free/reduced-price lunches and stu-
dents who did not obtain school lunches were also lower
in states that exceeded USDA standards ( = 11.0; 95%
CI, 17.7 to 4.3). Results were similar when analyz-
ing students who obtained regular-price lunches, but the
interaction was not as large.

gest that differences in purchasing/consumption be-
tween school lunch participants and nonparticipants were
greater in states that exceeded USDA standards. Over-
all, there was little evidence that students in states that
exceeded USDA standards purchased more foods or bev-
erages from other school or nonschool venues. Esti-
mates differed slightly between students who obtained
free/reduced-price lunches vs those who obtained regular-
price lunches, because their respective parameter esti-
mates were in opposite directions from the null for both
sweets and salty snacks. Estimates were relatively small
and imprecise, however, and there was not enough evi-
dence to attribute any differences in either category
to school meal laws.
COMMENT
Several experts have pointed out the poor nutrition qual-
ity of NSLP meals2,3,5,6,33 and questioned if the program
has contributed to the increase in childhood obe-
sity.7-10,34 Critics have generally not considered how state
policymakers can enhance the positive effect of federal
school meal programs by implementing their own laws
governing school meal nutrition content. The results of
this study suggest that in states with laws that encour-
aged or required a specific number of fruits/vegetables,
reductions in trans fats, 1% or skim milk, and/or a mini-
mum proportion of whole grains, students who ob-
tained school lunches had a more favorable weight sta-
tus, particularly among participants eligible for a free/
reduced-price lunch. This quasi-experimental study
cannot prove causality, but it was designed to control for
unmeasured differences between states that are com-
mon to all students.

These results have direct implications for implemen-
tation of school meal standards that were recently re-
leased by the USDA.17 This study was modeled to com-
pare students in states that adhered to previous USDA
standards with students in states that exceeded previous
federalrequirementsbyincorporatingprovisionsthatwere
similar to 2012 USDA standards. None of the state laws
used in this study were identical to 2012 USDA stan-
dards,buteachincludedprovisionsthatarecurrentlybeing
implemented in schools nationwide. The evidence in this
study suggests that ongoing changes to school meal stan-
dards have the potential to reduce obesity, particularly
among students who are eligible for free/reduced-price
lunches,thoughadditionallongitudinalresearchisneeded
to confirm this. Longitudinal studies could also exam-
ine whether any effects of school meal reforms change
over time as new standards are integrated.
This study also examined the possibility that students
compensated for school meal laws by purchasing or con-
sumingmorefoodsandbeveragesfromothervenues.Policy
resistanceisacommonphenomenonthatoccurswhenpoli-
cies trigger behavioral or environmental changes that ne-
gate the policy.35 Overall, there was little evidence of com-
pensation, but even modest positive associations between
laws and in-school purchasing among students who pur-
chased a full-price lunch may explain why the associa-
tion between state laws and weight status was weaker in
this population. Such feedback mechanisms would be con-
sistent with previous school nutrition policy evaluation
studies.36 Purchasing and consumption are also vulner-
able to measurement error,37 and questions did not in-
clude information on volume that was purchased. Future
studies could use more precise instruments (eg, 24-hour
recall) to assess whether stringent school meal standards
are associated with increases in intake from other sources
or lower participation in school lunch programs. Early me-
dia reports suggested that some students protested new
USDA standards,38 but to our knowledge, this topic has
not been studied rigorously.
Identifying compensatory mechanisms is particu-
larly important because of the widespread availability of
competitive foods in schools.5,6,20 Unless school meal
laws are accompanied by nutrition education and initia-
tives to limit energy-dense competitive foods and bev-
erages, then even the most stringent school meal stan-
dards may be undermined by competitive foods.
Studying the comprehensive effect of school meal and
competitive food laws is an important topic for future
research. This study was unable to analyze school meal
and competitive food laws in conjunction because of
the small number of states that exceeded USDA stan-
dards, but there will be future opportunities to do so as
policymakers continue to target both domains. States
and districts have strengthened competitive food and
school meal policies since 2006-200739 and the Healthy,
Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 requires the develop-
ment and implementation of nationwide nutrition stan-
dards for competitive foods in schools that participate
in federal meal programs.40 Studying the comprehen-
sive effect of policies across domains will require exam-
ining how different intervention targets interact with
each other and with the broader environment.41
Results of this study should be interpreted cautiously
because of several limitations. Foremost, the cross-
sectional design makes it impossible to conclude whether
differences in weight status were caused by school meal
laws. The study design cannot account for state-level vari-
ables that affect students who obtain free/reduced-price
lunches differently than students who do not obtain school
lunches (eg, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram42). The small number of states in the intervention
group further increases the risk of state-level confound-
ing. The quantity of missing data may have biased re-
sults, as missing data were associated with several demo-
graphic characteristics and weight status. The lack of data
on school meal content makes it further difficult to ascer-
tain whether any differences in weight status were attrib-
utable to state laws, and implementation of state laws may
have varied within the state because of district policies or
varying degrees of adherence. Timing of implementation
may have varied, too, as we do not have comparable data
on laws prior to 2006-2007. Finally, laws that exceeded
USDA standards included some, but not all, of the 2012
updates to USDA standards, and specific standards, eg, re-
duced trans fats or 1% or skim milk, varied from state to
state, making it impossible to analyze whether one stan-
dard had more of an impact than another.
The evidence supporting stringent school meal stan-
dards is far from conclusive, but this study provides
promising signs of the potential for the USDA updated
standards to improve student weight status. Previous
standards had not been updated since 1995 and did not
include specific provisions that were consistent with
the latest nutrition science. State laws that require
schools to provide meals that are consistent with the
Dietary Guidelines for Americans would complement
the updated USDA school meal standards and enhance
the potential of federal and state initiatives to reduce
obesity.
