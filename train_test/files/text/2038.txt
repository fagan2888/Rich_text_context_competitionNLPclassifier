Methodological problem with comparing
increases in different measures of body weight
Helen L Walls*, Anna Peeters, Haider Mannan and Christopher Stevenson
Abstract
Background: A number of studies have compared proportional increases over time in waist circumference (WC)
and body mass index (BMI). However this method is flawed. Here, we explain why comparisons of WC and BMI
must take into account the relationship between them. We used data from two cross-sectional US surveys
(NHANES 1988-94 and 2005-06), and calculated the percentage change in the average BMI and the average WC
between the two surveys, comparing the results with a regression analysis of changes in WC relative to BMI.
Findings: The crude percentage change in BMI (5.8%) was marginally greater than for WC (5.1%). But these
percentages cannot be directly compared, as the relationship between the measures is described by a regression
equation with an intercept term that does not equal zero. The coefficient of time from the regression equation will
determine whether or not WC is on average larger for a given BMI at the second compared with the first time
point.
Conclusion: Differences in the percentage change in WC and the percentage change in BMI cannot be usefully
directly compared. Comparisons of increases in the two measures must account for the relationship between them
as described by the regression equation.
Introduction
A number of studies have compared changes over time
in waist circumference (WC), a measure of abdominal
obesity, with body mass index (BMI) and suggested that
the nature of excess body weight may be changing to
one of greater abdominal obesity [1-8]. Abdominal obe-
sity appears to be more strongly correlated with meta-
bolic and cardiovascular risk than BMI [9,10], and thus
whether the nature of the obesity epidemic is changing
to one of greater abdominal obesity may have important
implications for the burden of obesity-related disease.
However some studies exploring this question have
based their conclusions on different proportional
increases in the two measures of excess body weight
[3-5,7,8]. This method is flawed, due to the nature of
the relationship between WC and BMI.
Methods
We analysed data from two nationally representative
cross-sectional surveys of the US population, the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Studies
(NHANES), conducted by the US National Center for
Health and Statistics. The surveys were conducted dur-
ing the time periods 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III), and
2005 to 2006. In each survey participants were selected
using a multistage, stratified cluster sampling design to
be representative of the civilian, non-institutionalised US
population.
We analysed in two ways the change in WC and BMI
between these two periods. First, we calculated the per-
centage change in the average BMI and the average WC
between the two time points. Second, we fitted a regres-
sion equation with WC as the dependent (outcome)
variable and BMI and time as predictor variables­along
with a number of potential confounder variables [2].
Results
In our analysis there was a marginally greater crude per-
centage change in BMI (5.8%) than WC (5.1%), but
using regression analysis we demonstrated that increases
in WC were in fact greater than expected based on
increases in BMI [2]. Differences in the percentage
change in BMI and WC do not indicate that one

indicator has moved independently further than the
other, due to the nature of the relationship between
BMI and WC.
One way to understand this is to consider changes in
temperature as measured in degrees Fahrenheit (°F)
and degrees Celsius (°C). There is a well-defined struc-
tural relationship between Fahrenheit (°F) and degrees
Celsius (°C), whereas the example we are exploring of
body weight is a data-driven regression relationship.
However, the example of the two temperature scales
provides a clear and simple example of the underlying
issue.
The relationship between these measures of tempera-
ture is described by:
F = C  9/5 + 32
An increase in temperature from 25°C to 30°C corre-
sponds to an increase from 77°F to 86°F, and the actual
increase in temperature is of course identical, just mea-
sured on two different scales. But if the proportional
increases in these measures are calculated without con-
sideration of the relationship between them, there
appears to be a much greater proportional increase in
temperature when measured in degrees Celsius (20.0%)
than in degrees Fahrenheit (11.7%). The size of the
model intercept term relating the measures (in this case,
32) drives the misconception.
To explore this in a more theoretical manner using
the relationship between WC and BMI, let's assume the
relationship between WC and BMI does not change
over time (and is not affected by confounders - assumed
throughout these examples for ease of explanation).
Such a relationship is based on this regression equation:
WC =  +   BMI (1)
In this equation,  is the model intercept term and a
is the coefficient of BMI. Thus, rearranging (1) to calcu-
late the percentage change in WC gives us:
(WC2
- WC1
)
WC1
=
  (BMI2
- BMI1
)
 +   BMI1
(2)
In this equation, WCi
, BMIi
and ti
are the values of
WC, BMI and time at time i. If the model intercept
term () is zero, the BMI coefficients (a) cancel out and
the percentage change in WC is equal to the percentage
change in BMI. There is a theoretical common zero for
BMI and WC­a person with zero BMI would have zero
WC­but in reality this zero is never reached. Over the
range of observable values BMI and WC generally have
a relationship where the model intercept term () is not
zero. Thus, whether WC increases more or less than
BMI is dependent on the value of .
Let's explore a real-life scenario using estimates from
our data [2]. The estimated mean values for BMI and
WC were:
BMI1
= 27.1 kg/m2
BMI2
= 28.7 kg/m2
WC1
= 93.3 cm
WC2
= 98.1 cm
The BMI increase from 27.1 kg/m2 to 28.7 kg/m2 cor-
responds to a 5.8% increase and the WC increase from
93.3 cm to 98.1 cm corresponds to an increase of 5.1%.
However we cannot directly compare these percentage
increases and conclude that the change in BMI is
greater than the increase in WC due to the fact that the
relationship between the two measures is described by a
regression equation with a model intercept term that
does not equal zero. In fact, if we fit the regression
model specified in equation (1), then we get the follow-
ing estimates:
 = 37.2
a = 2.2
If this were a structural relationship like the tempera-
ture example described above, we could subtract 37.2
from WC. Our adjusted WC would then have a zero
coinciding with that of BMI so that the  term in equa-
tions (1) and (2) would be zero. Hence we could directly
calculate a percent increase in WC­in this case 8.5%­
to compare with the 5.8% increase in BMI. There are
two problems with this. Firstly, this is a data-driven rela-
tionship not a structural relationship so that the value of
the  term will depend on the specific data set we are
examining and on any co-variates included in the
model. Secondly, if our aim is to compare the increase
in WC with that in BMI, then we should have a way of
testing whether any observed difference between
increases in BMI and WC could have arisen by chance.
A better way to explore whether BMI or WC has
moved to a greater extent relative to the other is to con-
sider regression equation (1) with the addition of a time
variable:
WC =  +   BMI +   t (3)
Equation (3) implies that the coefficient of time (g)
will determine whether or not WC is on average larger
for a given BMI at the second time point compared
with the first time point.
The parameter estimates from our data were:
 = 21.8
a = 2.2
g = 0.85
Note the very different estimate of ­21.8 compared
to our earlier estimate of 37.2. Equation (3) implies that
for a given BMI, the WC at the second time point will
be on average 0.85 cm higher than the WC at the first

time point. This clearly shows that for a given increase
in BMI, the increase in WC is higher than expected, not
lower, as predicted by the comparisons of proportional
increases in BMI and WC. Further, we can formally test
whether the g term is statistically significantly different
to zero­that is whether the higher increase in WC is
due to chance. In our case the p value associated with g
is p < 0.0001, so the relationship is unlikely to have
arisen by chance.
This model is theoretical; the real-life application of
this model will require adjustments needed for interac-
tions between variables such as BMI and time, and con-
sideration given to non-linear temporal effects.
However, it does illustrate the problems arising in a
direct comparison of percentage changes in BMI and
WC. Further, while our model is data-driven, this issue
is not unique to our analysis. For example, Elobeid et al.
[1] found a non-zero intercept when relating BMI to
WC using a different modelling analysis.
The relationship could equally be described with BMI
as the dependent variable and WC as the independent
variable. In this case equation (3) would be reformulated
as:
BMI =  +   WC +   t (4)
Note that one feature of regression analysis is that this
will generally not be the same equation as equation (3).
The parameter estimates from our data were in this
case:
 = -3.66
a = 0.37
g = -0.02
Equation (4) implies that for a given WC, the BMI at
the second time point will be on average 0.02 kg/m2
smaller than the BMI at the first time point.
Conclusion
The relationship between the percentage change in WC
and the percentage change in BMI is not simple and dif-
ferences in their percentage increases cannot be directly
compared. Comparisons of increases in the two mea-
sures must account for the relationship between them
as described by the regression equation.
