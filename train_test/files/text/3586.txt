Introduction
Predicting elections is hard enough. Elections may be the
easy case. They come around fairly regularly and generally
have set rules for their resolution that are observable.
However, leaders of countries often change for irregular
reasons. In late February 2014, pro-Russian President
Viktor Yanukovych of Ukraine fled the capital after mass
protests erupted into violence, and parliament appointed an
interim President to rule until the May elections. A month
earlier, in the Central African Republic, Muslim President
Michel Djotodia was forced out of office in the face of
escalating violence between the Muslim Séléka regime and
the largely Christian anti-balaka coalition. In July 2013, the
military in Egypt staged a coup and removed democrati-
cally elected Mohammed Morsi from the Presidency, fol-
lowing waves of protest against Muslim Brotherhood rule.
Each of these three events ­ a successful mass protest
campaign, a successful rebellion, and a coup d'état ­ all
share the same outcome: the sudden removal of a sitting
leader by means outside the "normal" range of political
competition. We call this outcome irregular leadership
change (ILC): the unexpected removal of the principal
political leader through means that contravene a state's
conventions and laws. Instead of addressing specific mech-
anisms that drive different types of ILCs, such as narrow
conspiracies, mass protests, or armed insurrections, we
instead focus on what leads to the common outcome of
ILC. Viewed this way, there have been about four dozen
ILCs around the world between 2001 and February 2014,
beginning with Mullar Omar's seizure of power in
Afghanistan in 2001 and ending with Yanukovych's depar-
ture from Ukraine in February of 2014. Only about 40% of
these are coups d'état.
What causes irregular leadership
change?
Early interest in coups began in political science during the
1960s (Huntington, 1968; Jackman, 1978; Johnson et al.,
1984). Inspired by a wide range of coups that took place in
Africa, early work focused on the structural determinants
of coups. Goemans and Marinov (2011) note three distinct
classes of arguments for why coups occur: political insta-
bility resulting from rapid economic modernization
(Deutsch, 1961); political illegitimacy following lacklus-
ter economic performance and development (McGowan,
Ensemble forecasting of irregular
leadership change

Abstract
Using updated Archigos Data, as well as structural and event data, we construct a split-population duration model
of irregular leadership changes. These are leadership changes that occur outside of the normal, legal framework for
leadership transitions. Our model was estimated in March 2014 and produced probability estimates of leadership
changes in many countries in the world. We used a wisdom-of-the-crowds approach to combining estimates from
various different models. Ukraine and Thailand are among those in which we had the highest predictions for irregular
change of leaders.

2003); and conditions that increase the likelihood of mili-
tary intervention in politics (Jenkins and Kposowa, 1990;
Johnson et al., 1984). These arguments are not disjoint:
while one set informs us about the conditions under which
a coup might occur, for example as a result of certain struc-
tural conditions like the political system, factionalism, or a
politicized military, the other provides traction on when a
coup may occur if the structural conditions are ripe.
The wave of revolutions that brought down communism
in Eastern Europe in the early 1990s and the wave of revo-
lutions during the Arab Spring in 2011 have each led schol-
ars to attempt to explain how these revolutions could have
so unexpectedly affected monumental change in once "sta-
ble" regimes (e.g. Kuran, 1995). Explanations for the sud-
denness and apparent unpredictability of such revolutions
have focused on tipping points that lead to cascades of pro-
test (Kuran, 1991).
Coups are very different from revolutions affected by
mass protests, but they have common explanations: conflict
between the government and dissidents, bad civil­military
relations, and a distinction between general risk and imme-
diate triggers. Empirical work has focused on general risk
using static or slow-moving variables such as regime types,
economic performance, or military budgets. These might
tell us whether there is widespread dissatisfaction with a
political system, or troubled civil­military relations and a
politicized military, but do not tell us much about the spe-
cific timing of events. Triggering events have received less
attention, but plausible candidates include indicators sensi-
tive to escalating confrontations between the military or
protesters and the reigning government.
ILCs, like coups, revolutions, and rebellions, are appar-
ently heterogeneous processes. The selectorate theory of
political survival (Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2005) hints at
the possibility of a general framework. It approaches transi-
tions from the leader's decision-making perspective in
which coalition partners must be placated in order to stay in
power. Whether it is just a few groups, or a large slice of the
population, if those who keep the status quo leaders in
power are unhappy, then there is likely to be a turnover.
However, even this theory does not draw the distinction
between regular and irregular changes.
In short, no one has a unified theoretical explanation of
why ILCs occurs.
Immunity and risk
In modeling ILCs, we address the split between structural
risk and immediate triggers. Many approaches to modeling
conflicts and abrupt transitions look at all possible cases,
and identify variables that can help explain the underlying
data. One should not just analyze the cases where there is
an ILC (known as selecting on the dependent variable). Yet,
we need to gain leverage on the timing of events in those
countries that are unstable. We use split-population models
to help with these two issues in studying the irregular and
abrupt nature of leadership changes.
Split-population duration models posit that not all cases
are at risk of failure. For all practical purposes, countries
like Canada are unlikely to experience ILC within our time
period of interest, whereas many countries in Africa and the
Middle East have experienced ILCs over the past decades.
The important point from a modeling perspective is to con-
ceptually separate at-risk countries from those that are
practically immune. Once separated, the hazard of an ILC
can be better evaluated for all countries.1
One advantage of this modeling approach is that it
allows covariates to have both a long-term and short-term
impact, depending on where they enter the model. Variables
that enter the immunity equation have a very long-term
impact because they change the probability of being at risk
at all. Variables in the duration equation have a short-term
impact that modifies the expected duration until the next
failure. We use this approach to estimate the duration of
regimes over the period from 1955 to the present.
A strategy for prediction
Rather than engage in testing hypotheses or conducting a
horserace of statistical significance (Ward et al., 2010), we
instead develop a suite of different models, each capturing
different insights. We then see how well these perform on
data that we have held back and develop a set of weights
that tell us how well each model performs in these calibra-
tion data. Then, we use the calibration weights to help con-
struct a probability density that combines all the individual
models in the suite into one single estimate, which is then
examined with an additional set of data that we have held
back for this specific purpose. This general approach has
proven useful in a number of areas. It is called Ensemble
Bayesian Model Averaging (EBMA; Montgomery et al.,
2012; Raftery et al., 2005). Among the more famous dem-
onstrations of this kind of ensemble wisdom was a compe-
tition to guess the weight of an ox at the West of England
Fat Stock and Poultry Exhibition. Galton (1907) famously
demonstrated that, while individual entrants were often
wildly inaccurate, aggregating these into an average
resulted in a remarkably accurate estimate.
We measure ILCs using the Archigos data on political
leaders, which includes the duration of leadership and
whether it starts or stops in an irregular fashion. We have
updated these data to the present and they provide the dura-
tion data we model. These data are combined with our
covariates at the monthly level, focusing on the period
between 2001 and the present. Our covariates fall into three
broad categories. The first are structural variables such as
GDP per capita, the Amnesty Political Terror Scale, or
regime types. These variables tend to be measured at the
country­year level, and mostly vary between countries, but
vary less within any particular country. Thus they are more
Beger et al. 3
useful for distinguishing risk sets than predicting the timing
of particular events.
The structural variables include several economic and
financial indicators such as GDP, population, mortality,
military expenditures, broadband subscribers, cell service
subscribers, foreign direct investment and consumer price
index (CPI) from the World Development Indicators (World
Bank Group, 2013), the Polity regime variables (Marshall
and Jaggers, 2002), indicators for the number and power
relationships of ethnic groups from the Ethnic Power
Relations data (Cederman et al., 2009), and the Political
Terror Scale (Wood and Gibney, 2010), as well as second-
ary measures constructed from the Archigos data, such as
indicators for leaders who entered irregularly or through
foreign imposition (Goemans et al., 2009).
The behavioral variables are constructed from the
Integrated Crisis Early Warning System (ICEWS) event
data, and record the number of certain types of events in a
country over the course of a month, for example protests
directed at the government. The ICEWS event data are
based on (machine) coded media reports that are parsed for
actors, locations, and actions to create event records, using
the conflict and mediation event observations (CAMEO)
ontology. We include aggregations of events, particularly
so-called quad variables that capture verbal and material
conflict and cooperation within government and between
government and dissidents. For example, verbal coopera-
tion includes making positive public statements, appeals, or
consultations, while verbal conflict captures reports of
investigations, public demands, or threats. These variables
change over time within countries, making them useful for
timing the onset of events.
The third set of variables includes spatial lags of the
behavioral, event-based variables. A spatial lag captures
neighborhood effects, for example the average level of pro-
tests in Egypt's neighbors at the time of the uprisings (Ward
and Gleditsch, 2008). There are different ways to define
what constitutes a country's neighborhood, and we include
weights constructed on the basis of the four nearest neigh-
boring countries, the distance between country centroids,
and Gower distances (Gower, 1971) of country's similarity
on either political, economic, or event measures.
From these variables we construct seven models, each
concentrating on substantive themes we believe relevant in
understanding political survival.
Leader characteristics
Drawing on the literature on leadership tenure (Acemoglu
and Robinson, 2006; Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2005,
Svolik, 2012), we build a model that captures the leaders'
individual characteristics, as well as internal regime coop-
eration. The literature on leadership survival focuses not
only on a leader's ability to consolidate power over time,
but also considers that as a leader consolidates power, they
are more likely to create discontent among those who are
not politically represented by the regime. The risk equation
thus includes a count of the months a leader has been in
power. To capture the legitimacy of a leader and by associa-
tion his or her government, we include two further varia-
bles in the risk equation that indicate whether the current
leader of a state entered power through irregular means or
by foreign imposition. Leaders who entered through ille-
gitimate, irregular means might themselves be more likely
to suffer the same fate. The duration equation uses the
material behavior of dissidents, whether cooperative or
conflictual, to capture the timing. We use material rather
than verbal actions to model the timing of an ILC against
illegitimate leaders.
Public discontent
The public discontent model focuses on verbal interactions
as well as protests to provide an early warning indicator of
ILCs. We also examine verbal cooperation within govern-
ment, primarily but not exclusively as an indicator of the
health of civil­military relations. Since the level of public,
verbal interactions in a society is related to access to media
and the ability to voice demands, for the model in the risk
equation we include per capita measures of Internet users
and cell subscribers. Many authoritarian governments
implement censorship to control the information available
to citizens. We also include the fraction of excluded popula-
tion in a country as a control, since minority governments
facing a large opposition have strong incentives to display
unity.
Global instability
Our third model is loosely based on the main components
of the Goldstone et al. (2010) model. Using these findings
on what factors drive global instability, we have created a
model loosely based on theirs, but necessarily different
given our different modeling strategy and data resolution.
In our version, the partial democracy with factionalism
indicator did not perform as well as simply including the
Polity participation of competitiveness variable, which cap-
tures whether "alternative preferences for policy and lead-
ership can be pursued in the political arena." Echoing the
Goldstone approach, we include GDP and the percentage of
the population excluded from the political process into the
risk equation. Then, to predict the timing of ILC, we include
participation competitiveness, a measure of conflict within
the four nearest neighbors, as well an indicator of female
life expectancy at birth.
Anti-regime protests
This thematic model is entirely focused on protest. Civil
resistance campaigns are an effective means for achieving
4 Research and Politics 
leadership change. The literature on both coup-proofing
(Pilster and Böhmelt, 2011; Quinlivan, 1999) and civil
resistance campaigns (Chenoweth and Stephan, 2011)
describe a key force behind protest movements: their abil-
ity to influence the military. A pivotal movement in many
civil resistance campaigns is the moment when state forces
stop obeying orders from the head of state, and refuse to
openly repress protestors. This model captures the basic
intuition of this argument by including slower moving
structural variables, such as low levels of domestic crises
and military expenditure, into the risk equation. This model
is structured by the argument that the least satisfied militar-
ies will be most likely to resist commands to repress. In the
duration equation we account for protest and conflict in dif-
ferent forms: ethnic-religious violence, rebellion, protest
events, and nearby rebellion events in other countries.
Contagion
This model captures the concept of conflict contagion. To
model the risk for successful contagion of mass protests or
other conflict that may lead to an ILC, we include the coun-
try's Amnesty International Political Terror Scale value,
which captures overall repressiveness, as well as opposi-
tion resistance, which counts the number of events con-
ducted by groups associated with armed anti-government
groups. The latter largely varies between rather than within
countries, and we thus include it as a static variable. These
two variables capture the overall security climate in a coun-
try. To further refine the general risk posed in a repressive
society with ongoing terror or political violence, we include
an indicator of temporally proximate elections. This varia-
ble identifies whether an election will occur in the near
future or has occurred in the near past. Finally, we include
the country's population size as an indicator of society's
inertia and resistance to outside influences.
Having specified risk, we use two spatial weights of
opposition resistance and state repression in neighboring
countries to model the timing until contagion, and hence
increased chance of ILC, occurs.
Internal conflict
The internal conflict model uses GDP per capita, the prox-
imity of the next national election, and the level of
Autocracy in the country as general indicators of risk,
while focusing on intra-governmental conflict and the
widespread use of cell technology as duration triggers.
Intra-governmental tensions, protests to the government,
and the number of cell phones are taken to interact to influ-
ence the duration of leadership tenure and the likelihood of
an irregular transfer. First-order components of this inter-
action also are included in the duration equation, but the
second-order interactions (e.g. the two-way interactions)
are excluded as they cause instabilities in the likelihood.
Financial risks
This model assumes that financial instability may unseat
leaders who are already in a precarious situation. The base-
line risk is determined by GDP per capita, as a measure of
general prosperity and the looming presence of the next
election, as well as the size of the country as measured by
population. In addition, it includes the Amnesty assessment
of terrorism (stability) and the degree of anti-government.
If a country is in the high risk set, it is the degree of infla-
tion, as measured by consumer prices, and the health of the
country's international financial reserves (taken from the
International Monetary Fund's (IMF's) International
Financial Statistics (IFS)) that affect most directly the dura-
tion of leadership.
Summary of modeling strategy
Prior to statistical estimation, we divide our data into sepa-
rate partitions. A fourth partition is the data yet to be
observed: that is, the future. We use this tripartite division
to guard against overfitting (see Figure 1).
Each theme is estimated separately in the training data
using a split-population estimator that we have created. The
seven streams of predictions from these models for the

calibration period are examined with the EBMA approach
to calibrate a set of performance weights. These weights
and the underlying theme prediction combine to form the
ensemble. Finally, we examine the performance of each
theme as well as the ensemble in a final partition of the
data, the test partition. In this short presentation, we spare
the reader all of these details, and turn to the actual fore-
casts made by this approach.2
At the request of several readers of this work and in
honor of Christopher Achen (2005), we ran a "garbage can"
logit regression with the 39 covariates from our theme
models. The findings are not surprising. Such models typi-
cally have the characteristic of over-fitting the in-sample
data. Much social science seems to stop there and declare
victory. However, such garbage can models almost always
are terrible at out-of-sample predictions. That is exactly
what we found: our theme models (as well as the ensemble
composite) are about one-third better in terms of recall and
precision. We could not estimate a similar all-in split-
duration model due to convergence issues, but a version
that includes the 13 covariates from the two models that
receive the largest weights in the ensemble, contagion and
internal conflict, also performs worse out of sample. Table
1 illustrates this fit of the two baseline models versus our
ensemble model.
Examining predicted change
Using the ensemble model and data from March 2014 we
create forecasts for the probability of ILC over the period
from April to September 2014. We aggregate the monthly
forecasts produced by this model to an overall probability
of ILC anytime during this time period, and Table 2 shows
the 10 highest forecasts that result.3
These predictions were made in March 2014.
Probabilities are not certainties. For every 20 estimates that
there is a 0.05 chance of rain; for a properly calibrated
model, one should expect it to rain at least once. ILCs are
very rare events. Our top five predictions include Ukraine,
Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yemen, Egypt, and Thailand.
Ukraine lost the Crimea to Russia this spring, but the pro-
tests in the winter of 2013 continued into the new year and
violent protests occurred in the middle of February 2014
that were in part a response to the so-called Anti-Protest
laws enacted in the previous month. By the end of February,
Parliament essentially ousted the President and scheduled a
May 25 election. This created a succession crisis in which
the deposed president, Yanukovich, and his supporters in
Russia began to create a larger conflict in Ukraine. Russian
involvement spawned further local conflict within Ukraine.
Continuing conflict within the government and separatist
activities in the east, in combination with a new govern-
ment, place Ukraine at the top of our model predictions.
Poroshenko won the May 2014 elections, but several thou-
sand have been killed and many more have fled the violence
in Eastern and Southern Ukraine.
Bosnia and Herzegovina has been the site of substantial
and widespread anti-government protests in early 2014, the
so-called Bosnian Spring. These were organized in large
part because of the frailty of the economy, the high level of
unemployment, and the non-payment of pensions. Prime
Minister Vjekoslav Bevanda has minimized the protests.
However, as the leader of an increasingly weak central gov-
ernment, the greatest instability may reside in the locally
governed regions.
Yemen is the site of protests accompanied by the pres-
ence of a very powerful Al-Qaeda army. That, alongside a
set of rulers widely reported to be corrupt, creates an unsta-
ble situation. Yemen is in the throes of (another) reorgani-
zation in which central authority seems likely to devolve to
regional ruling coalitions.
Egypt sees an outbreak of protests and violence every
year in February to celebrate the resignation of Mubarak
and the start of the so-called revolution in the early spring
of 2011. In mid-2013 these protests spread and sparked a
coup d'état that displaced Morsi. In mid-2013 Mansour
was appointed as acting president. In early 2014 a new con-
stitution was overwhelmingly ratified by Egyptian voters,
even though roughly two-thirds of the potential voters
avoided participating. In May 2014, a presidential election
was won by Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian commander-
in-chief. Tension remains high and the legitimacy and pop-
ularity of the current regime is tenuous, at best.

Thailand has been a puzzling cauldron of political con-
flict for over a decade. Thaksin Shinawatra was overthrown
by a coup d'état in the fall of 2006, and the resulting junta
instituted martial law and forbade many political activities
until mid-2007. Things continued to be contentious and
violent, but by mid-2011 things had calmed down and
Yingluck Shinawatra handily won the election. Toward the
end of 2013, protests heated up quite a bit as did demands
for the resignation of Yingluck. Scheduled elections were
not held in 2014, as the listing of candidates outraged anti-
government forces. As this was written, on May 7, the
(Supreme) Constitutional court ruled that Yingluck had
abused power and was to be removed from the Prime
Ministership. It is unclear how this will turn out, except to
note that this will constitute another ILC in mid-2014.
Model fit statistics
Any probabilistic model for ILCs will have a tradeoff
between false positives and false negatives. In a random
guess this tradeoff is even, leading to the receiver operat-
ing characteristic (ROC) curve shown in red in Figure 2.
Any useful model should exceed it. The ROC curves for
the ensemble ­ in-sample (dashed) and out-of-sample
(solid) ­ show good fit with areas under the curve (AUCs)
above 0.84 for our monthly data and above 0.91 when we
annualize our predictions for comparison with work at the
country­year.
With infrequent events such as ILCs it also makes sense
to evaluate recall and precision. Recall is the fraction of
events accurately predicted by a model, and precision is
how many positive predictions turn out to be actual events,
or how believable the predictions are. As before, there is a
tradeoff between the two depending on the cutoff one
chooses for separating probabilistic predictions to 0/1 val-
ues. The ensemble obtains a recall of 0.5 with a precision of
0.016 or 1 in 60 in the monthly data, and around 1 in 5 in
annualized data. With data as sparse as ours, a model needs
to perform extremely well by conventional standards in
order to make predictions we can take at face value.
Conclusion
We used new, temporally disaggregated data that included
behavioral variables derived from event data. We also
employed split-population duration and ensemble mode-
ling approaches to examine ILCs over the period from 1955
to the present. Each of these aspects is novel in the study of
leadership change. In so doing we also developed a suite of
new empirical models that were measured monthly. In
addition, we then combined the forecasts of each of these
empirical models using EBMA to produce a single proba-
bility estimate that benefits from the so-called "wisdom of
the crowds." Along the way, we updated the dependent
variable over the past two and a half years.
The suite of models we developed is examined in his-
torical training data and was evaluated in test data that were
not used in the initial data construction. In both contexts,
the models are accurate and well calibrated. Finally, we use
a weighted ensemble combination of these models to pro-
duce six-month forecasts of the conditional hazard over the
period from April 2014 until September 2014. These pre-
dictions are discussed above, but in summary seem plausi-
ble. Indeed, two of the top 10 forecasts are Ukraine and
Thailand, both currently in the throes of transition crises.
In our attempt to forecast ILCs, we have created a com-
plex framework that breaks with many conventions in pre-
vious scholarship. This opens us to many criticisms, such as
questions about the rigor of the thematic models in our
suite, or the utility of the ILC concept. We tried to root the
models in themes notable in the literature on regime change.
However, our approach is inherently modular and open to
the inclusion of other models with the ensemble as arbiter
of their usefulness in prediction. This study may serve as a
foundation for future inquiry and to encourage scholars to
conduct similar investigations at the country­month level.
Many months pass in each country without an ILC. They
are rare. Our modeling approach has the goal to accurately
forecast ILCs, and the rarity of these events has led to the
novel aspects we have presented here. Still, we are looking
for needles in a haystack. Even our 10 highest predictions
have low probabilities of ILC. However, someone once
said, "reality is a low probability event."
