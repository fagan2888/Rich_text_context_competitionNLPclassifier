In the last decade, there has been an increase in interest in the burden of chronic and disabling health
conditions that are not necessarily fatal, such as the mental disorders. This review systematically summarizes
data on the burden associated with 11 major mental disorders of adults. The measures of burden include
estimates of prevalence, mortality associated with the disorders, disabilities and impairments related to the
disorders, and costs. This review expands the range of mental disorders considered in a report on the global
burden of disease, updates the literature, presents information on the range and depth of sources of information
on burden, and adds estimates of costs. The purpose is to provide an accessible guide to the burden of mental
disorders, especially for researchers and policy makers who may not be familiar with this subfield of epidemiology.

INTRODUCTION
One of the first challenges in building epidemiologic
knowledge about a given health condition is to establish
the burden associated with it. The field of psychiatric epi-
demiology has been slow in meeting this challenge, in part
because of disagreements about thresholds regarding the
presence of disorder (1) and in part because of the connected
failure to establish reliability of measurement (2, 3). Ex-
plicit diagnostic criteria provided in the American Psychi-
atric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, Third Edition (4) helped address these
problems and provided the foundation for population mea-
surement in the so-called third generation of psychiatric
epidemiology (5), which began with the National Institute
of Mental Health Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program
(6­8) and continues to the present.
A stimulus to efforts in descriptive epidemiology has
been the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study (9). It is
easier to describe the population aspects of diseases closely
associated with mortality than it is to do so for nonfatal
conditions, such as the psychiatric disorders. Incorporation
of nonfatal disability resulting from health conditions into
an overall measure of disease burden demonstrated to many
people, for the first time, the importance of the neuropsy-
chiatric conditions. In 2001, neuropsychiatric conditions as
a broad category were responsible for 21 percent of the total
disease burden in the world: only infectious and parasitic
diseases (41 percent) and cardiovascular diseases (26 per-
cent) were more important. Unipolar depressive disorder
was the leading source of burden among the psychiatric
conditions (6 percent); among the specific disease catego-
ries, only lower respiratory infections were more important
(11 percent) (Lopez et al., table 3C.9 (10)).
This review concisely and systematically summarizes
data on the burden associated with 11 major mental disor-
ders in adults. We decided that the corpus of literature would
not sustain a formal meta-analysis (11) and instead present
summary measures here. The measures of burden include
estimates of prevalence, mortality associated with the dis-
orders, disabilities and impairments related to the disorders,
and costs. To the extent possible, we build upon existing
reviews that are often focused on a single disorder.

Our review of prevalence and associated mortality
presents the essential summary data, including the number
of studies conducted, the median prevalence or relative risk,
and the interquartile range. It expands the range of mental
disorders considered in the GBD report, updates the litera-
ture, provides information on the range and depth of sources
of information on burden, and adds estimates of costs. The
purpose of the review is to provide an accessible guide to the
burden of mental disorders, especially for researchers and
policy makers who may not be familiar with this subfield of
epidemiology.
METHODS
The most common form of prevalence reported across the
11 disorders was the 1-year prevalence. The 1-year preva-
lence is a hybrid type of prevalence between lifetime prev-
alence and point prevalence, recording the history of the
disorder within a year prior to assessment (12). It differs
from lifetime prevalence in focusing on only 1 year. It dif-
fers from period prevalence in that data for individuals in the
designated population who entered during the year of study
but died before the assessment are not included in the nu-
merator of the rate. Since there is not a strong relation be-
tween the occurrence of mental disorders and death within
1 year, the 1-year prevalence is close to the 1-year period
prevalence. For those disorders that typically endure for a
year or more, the 1-year prevalence is not too different from
the point prevalence. Limitation of this review to the 1-year
prevalence has the advantage of reducing variation due to
differences in reporting period; it has the disadvantage that
many studies were not included in the results presented here
because they reported either a lifetime prevalence rate or
a point prevalence rate.
For the review of prevalence, only studies of the general
population were included, since a large proportion of indi-
viduals with mental disorders never end up in a treatment
setting. Studies of samples drawn from clinics, or from the
records of health maintenance organizations, were excluded
(except where noted for schizophrenia). We required that the
sample size be larger than 500 to enhance statistical stability
of the findings. To minimize effects of response bias, we
excluded studies in which the response rate was less than 60
percent. Only studies of adults, including a range of at least
20 years beyond age 15 years, were included. Studies that
focused on specific demographic groups of populations, for
example, defined by narrow age ranges, one gender, migrant
status, or socioeconomic status, were excluded. Studies of
special health populations, such as individuals with a par-
ticular health condition or disease, were also excluded.
Population-based studies of one ethnic group, or one na-
tional group, were included (i.e., fitting within the definition
of ``general population''). Where possible, in studies report-
ing data from more than one ethnic group and data from all
groups combined, the rate for the combined group was re-
ported, if available, or was computed, if possible; otherwise,
rates for specific ethnic groups were reported as if they were
separate studies. Where data for both genders were reported
separately and the sample numbers for each gender were
also reported, the rate for both sexes combined was esti-
mated and reported.
This review focuses on mental disorders with specific
diagnostic criteria, and it was a requirement that the assess-
ment procedure be in person or by telephone and that there
be some degree of structure to the assessment. Thus, studies
were included only if they used structured or semistructured
diagnostically oriented interviews conducted in person or by
telephone. The measurement characteristics of these meth-
ods have been reviewed elsewhere (13). Many studies were
eliminated because of this constraint. The diagnoses re-
ported in the studies had to match exactly the named di-
agnoses, so that, in the case of major depressive disorder,
for example, studies reporting groups of disorders such as
``depressive disorders'' or ``mood disorders'' were not in-
cluded. Two-stage studies were included as long as the sec-
ond stage yielded a specific diagnosis. In studies reporting
a diagnosis based on both the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders and the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, the prevalence of diagnosis based on the
former source was used.
For the reviews of mortality, there were similar restric-
tions. Again, taking depressive disorders as the example,
assessment of depression had to be similarly oriented toward
diagnosis, but the type of occurrence could be lifetime, pe-
riod, or at only one point in time. Studies based on samples
drawn from psychiatric clinics or psychiatric treatment-
based registers, or samples chosen because of other ill-
nesses, were excluded. A difference between the studies
selected for prevalence and for mortality is that samples with
restricted age ranges (usually the elderly) were included. In
addition, regarding the study of mortality, several studies
selected cases and noncases from population-based cohorts,
and these studies were included since estimation of the odds
ratio or relative risk does not require complete enumeration
of the cohort. Excluded were studies that reported mortality
due to a specific condition (e.g., cancer) but did not present
mortality due to all causes. As a result of these restrictions,
many high-quality studies were excluded.
Measures of disability are taken from the estimates of the
GBD Study (9), as well as estimates available from the
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES,
described below (14)) and the Canadian Community Health
Survey (15). Measures of per capita cost are taken from
a more limited range of studies. Some of these studies are
focused on the United States, and the costs given are in-
cluded here. When studies were not available on costs for
the United States, studies from other countries were located,
the costs were converted to 2005 US dollars, and then they
were applied to the median estimates of prevalence and the
US population to generate total costs.
The GBD disability weights were developed from ratings
of symptomatic and behavioral vignettes by expert raters in
a consensus process. Raters were asked to make choices
regarding prevention programs comparing extension of life
for a healthy person (e.g., a program that would extend
life for a healthy person by 1 year) with extension of life
(e.g., for 2 years) for a person disabled by a health condition.
A rating of 0.0 indicates no disability at all during a given
year of life, whereas a rating of 1.0 is equal to death. Higher
2 Eaton et al.
Epidemiol Rev 2008;30:1­14
values indicate more disability and lower quality of life.
A value of 0.5 indicates that the individual would have the
same quality of life for 2 years as a completely healthy
individual with a value of 0.0 would experience in 1 year.
These ratings have the advantage that population aspects of
burden of fatal and nonfatal conditions can be compared. As
an example, the severity rating for quadriplegia is 0.90, for
blindness is 0.62, for multiple sclerosis is 0.41, for deafness
is 0.33, for rheumatoid arthritis is 0.21, and for watery di-
arrhea is 0.07 (9). (Ratings for psychiatric conditions are
reported below.)
The CPES (14) is a combination of three surveys in the
United States with representative samples of the entire adult
population of the United States (National Comorbidity Sur-
vey Replication (16)), the African-American population of
the United States (National Survey of American Life (17)),
and the Latin-American and Asian population of the United
States (National Latino and Asian American Survey (18)).
The combined sample size for the CPES is 20,130, and all
three surveys met our eligibility criteria. The surveys in the
CPES used the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) to assess
impairment due to many of the disorders addressed in this
review (19). The SDS is a brief self-report measure that
assesses functional impairments on a 10-point, discretized,
analog scale (0 5 no disability, 1­3 5 mild, 4­6 5 moder-
ate, 7­9 5 marked, 10 5 extreme). It was designed for
clinical trials and has been used in hundreds of research
studies and translated into 48 languages (20). In the CPES,
the SDS was used in the separate sections corresponding to
each disorder, with separate questions relating to the extent
to which each of four areas of functioning in work, house-
hold, relationship, and social roles was impaired in the worst
month of the past year for the problems associated with the
given disorder (21). In the current analysis, a threshold of
disability was based on a rating of marked-to-extreme im-
pairment (i.e., scale value of 7). In this review, we report
the percentage of the individuals meeting criteria for a given
disorder who have marked-to-extreme impairment on one or
more of the four SDS role domains.
The CPES did not include SDS data for alcohol and drug
disorders, but these impairment measures were available
for alcohol and drug dependence disorders from the 2002
Canadian Community Health Survey cycle 1.2, a probability
sample of 36,984 community-dwelling respondents repre-
senting the population of Canada older than 15 years of age,
which had a special focus on mental health and well-being
(15). The diagnoses in this survey were limited to alcohol or
drug dependence (i.e., not including alcohol and drug abuse
without dependence).
We conducted a targeted literature review by concentrat-
ing on US-based studies in the past 15 years to obtain data
on total cost estimates for the disease or cost per case per
year. Credible estimates for the United States were located
for major depressive disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence,
drug abuse or dependence, schizophrenia, and bipolar dis-
order. When data were unavailable, total costs from studies
conducted outside the United States were used to estimate
per capita costs for the population of adults. For these dis-
orders, the number of adults in the United States in 2005
(222 million) was multiplied by the median prevalences
given in table 1, and that product was multiplied by per
capita costs to generate total costs in the United States. Cost
estimates were adjusted to 2005 US constant dollars by using
inflation factor and/or purchasing power parity indices.
Prior systematic reviews were sought and were reported
to the degree possible for tables 1 and 2. The searches for

relevant studies were conducted by using the PubMed bib-
liographic retrieval system (National Library of Medicine,
Bethesda, Maryland). For example, our review of depressive
disorder began with the article by Waraich et al. (22), which
reported population-based studies of 1-year prevalence with
standardized, diagnostically oriented assessments with pub-
lication dates of 1980­2000. The search terms were ``pop-
ulation'' and ``depressive disorder'' and ``prevalence'' and
were ``depressive disorder'' and ``mortality'' for the reviews
of prevalence and mortality, respectively. The yield in ar-
ticles for these broad terms is included in tables 1 and 2. In
searching for the widest net possible, the search terms for
each of the disorders were varied but always included these
broad terms. Complete citations for all studies used--that is,
including those in the prior reviews--are listed in this paper
for the convenience of the reader who may want to investi-
gate individual articles more thoroughly.
For each disorder, separate Microsoft Excel spreadsheets
(Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, Washington) were pre-
pared for the prevalence and mortality studies, including
characteristics of the studies such as their location, target
population, sample size, response rate, diagnostic standard,
and assessment procedure. These spreadsheets, and the
relevant lists of citations, are available on the World
Wide Web at http://www.jhsph.edu/dept/mh/_includes/epi_
mental_disorders.html. Readers wanting to present future
studies for inclusion in the spreadsheets, criticize the choice
of studies, or alert us to studies we have omitted are invited
to do so via an e-mail contact address listed on that website.
The authors do not promise to respond to these suggestions
and critiques but only to read them and possibly adapt the
spreadsheets and lists of citations.
PREVALENCE
Median prevalence estimates ranged from 0.5 percent
for schizophrenia to 9.1 percent for personality disorders
(table 1). There were only five studies of the prevalence of
personality disorder, the smallest number for any disorder,
and the largest number was 42--for the studies of the prev-
alence of major depressive disorder.
The reviews of panic disorder, social phobia, and simple/
specific phobia built upon the review of Somers et al. (23),
who searched for studies from 1980 to 2004 and identified
15 that met their inclusion criteria. For panic disorder, 18
additional nonduplicated studies from our search were eli-
gible for data abstraction. The studies of these anxiety dis-
orders represent more than 200,000 sampled and assessed
persons. The estimates of 1-year prevalence for panic disor-
der ranged from 0.1 percent in rural villages in Taiwan to 3.2
percent in Florence, Italy, with a median of 0.9 and an inter-
quartile range of 0.6­1.9. For all six East Asian studies, prev-
alence estimates were in the lower quartile. The 1-year
prevalence estimates for social phobia ranged from 0.2 per-
cent in Korea and in Nigeria to 44.2 percent in Udmurtia,
a Russian republic, with a median of 2.8 and an interquartile
range of 1.1­5.8. All three of the East Asian studies had
prevalence rates of social phobia in the lower quartile. The
estimates of 1-year simple/specific phobia prevalence rates
ranged from 0.2 percent in Derry, Northern Ireland, to 11.1
percent in Oslo, Norway, with a median of 4.8 and an inter-
quartile range of 3.5­7.3 percent.
The findings for major depressive disorder built upon
the review of Waraich et al. (22), who searched for studies
from 1980 through 2000, finding 13 that met their criteria.

PubMed was searched by entering ``population prevalence''
and ``depressive disorder,'' yielding 3,935 titles (table 1), of
which 2,477 were published after 2000. Fifty-nine of these
studies appeared relevant, but only 29 nonduplicated studies
meeting the above criteria were eventually added to the
studies included in the Waraich et al. review. The 42 studies
represent a total sample of 290,471 persons. The 1-year
prevalence rates ranged from 0.64 percent in Taipei to
15.4 percent in Udmurtia, with a median of 5.3 and an
interquartile range of 3.6­6.5. Six of the nine studies in
the low quartile were in East Asia, but otherwise there were
no obvious conclusions to be reached about the place of the
study, the study method, or the time that it was conducted.
There were 19 studies of the prevalence of obsessive-
compulsive disorder. The search for relevant titles was aided
by a relatively comprehensive, but nonsystematic review by
Fontenelle et al. (24). The median 1-year prevalence of
obsessive-compulsive disorder was 1.0 percent, with an in-
terquartile range of 0.6­2.0 percent.
For the review of alcohol use disorder, 14 studies met the
inclusion criteria. The range was from a low of 4.1 percent
in Germany to a high of 10.6 percent in Norway; median
1-year prevalencewas 5.9 percent, and the interquartile range
was 5.2­8.1 percent. Most of these studies were conducted
in the United States. There were no obvious associations
with variables such as place of the study, the study method,
or the time that it was conducted.
The search for studies of drug use disorder yielded 1,417
titles, of which 467 were examined closely but only 11 met
the above criteria. The 1-year prevalences ranged from 0.4
percent in Mexico to 3.6 percent in the United States, and
the median prevalence was 1.8 percent. About 50 percent of
the studies were conducted in the United States. All studies
in the low quartile were conducted outside the United States
(i.e., Mexico, Germany, and Norway). The prevalence in the
single Australian study was in the high quartile.
The review of personality disorders identified 629 studies,
of which 168 were examined closely. Many of these focused
on a single personality disorder and were excluded. More
than 20 studies reported prevalence of all personality disor-
ders together, but they included clinical samples, restricted
age ranges, or assessments not meeting our criteria. Only
five studies met our inclusion criteria, the lowest number in
table 1, so we investigated the effect of relaxation of one or
another of the criteria. We found that the prevalence rate was
not much affected by these differences. Table 1 shows only
the five studies meeting our inclusion criteria. The median
prevalence based on these studies was 9.1 percent, with an
interquartile range of 9.0­14.4 percent.
The review of schizophrenia was taken from the work of
McGrath et al. (25) and was not updated. Of all the disorders
presented, schizophrenia is the one for which prevalence is
least likely to be underestimated because of reliance on data
from medical records, and also the one for which the di-
agnosis by an interviewer without medical training is most
suspect (26). Therefore, data from population-based medi-
cal reporting systems (registers) were included here. Since
the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia require a degree of
chronicity (6 months), these studies include point preva-
lence as well as 1-year prevalence. There were 23 relevant
studies, and the median prevalence was 0.5 percent. The
interquartile range for schizophrenia prevalences was the
smallest in table 1: 0.3­0.6 percent.
The review of bipolar disorder built upon the review of
Waraich et al. (22), who searched for studies from 1980
through 2000, finding 12 that met their criteria. We located
five studies published later than 2004 that are included in
this review. Studies that included bipolar II diagnoses, that
is, not presenting data specifically for bipolar I disorder,
were excluded. As with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder is
difficult to diagnose without a medically trained examiner,
but there were so few reports based on register systems that
we decided to include population-based survey studies as
long as they used a standardized structured interview. The
median prevalence was 0.6 percent, with a relatively small
interquartile range of 0.3­1.1 percent.
The review of the prevalence of dementia built upon
earlier work by Ferri et al. (27), with supplementary data
available on the World Wide Web (http://www.alz.co.uk/
research/consensus.html). Only those studies that made di-
agnoses based on an international and documented opera-
tional system (i.e., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders or the International Classification of Dis-
eases) were included. We required that studies of dementia
be focused on the elderly, defined here as older than 60
years of age (six studies focused on persons aged >60 years,
with the remainder focusing on persons aged >65 years)
and that the study report an overall prevalence rate for both
sexes and all ages combined. The studies varied as to the
number of stages required to reach a diagnosis (from one to
three). For this disorder only, the definition of ``general
population'' was expanded to include institutional popula-
tions, since, in Japan, Europe, and the United States, many
of the elderly live in institutional communities. The review
by Ferri et al. included reports from two systematic reviews
of 12 (28) and 11 (29) studies in Europe. The studies in-
cluded in these reviews could not be identified separately,
and thus the results shown in table 1 potentially under-
estimate European studies and the variation in studies
generally. The median prevalence was 5.4 percent of the
population over the age of 60 years, with an interquartile
range of 3.2­7.1 percent.
MORTALITY
We found many fewer studies of the risk of mortality
associated with a history of a mental disorder (table 2), even
though it has been a long-standing interest in psychiatry
(30­33). We were unable to find any credible estimates for
the association of mortality with social phobia or simple
phobia. Three of the four studies of panic disorder and mor-
tality, and both studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder
and mortality, were from different sites and time periods
of the Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program. These mea-
ger results for anxiety disorders may reflect a raised risk for
some individuals and a lower risk for others, depending, for
example, on age (34). The three studies that met our criteria
for drug abuse or dependence and mortality (drawn from the
Epidemiologic Catchment Area Program, as above) suggest
The Burden of Mental Disorders 5
Epidemiol Rev 2008;30:1­14
a doubling of risk, and three independent studies of person-
ality disorder suggest a quadrupling of risk of mortality.
For the study of major depressive disorder, the reviews of
Saz and Dewey (35) and of Wulsin et al. (36) were used. The
search terms ``mortality'' and ``depressive disorder'' and
``population'' were entered into PubMed, yielding 282
articles. Many articles were eliminated because they focused
on a specific cause of death, many others were excluded
because they used screening scales or symptom counts with-
out referring to a diagnosis, and a third large group was
eliminated because they included only those persons under
treatment for major depressive disorder. Five articles in the
review of Saz and Dewey met our criteria, and nine were
added from the results of the literature search. Our review
indicated that depressive disorder raises the risk of all-cause
mortality by about 70 percent, with an interquartile range of
relative risks of 1.3­2.2.
For alcohol use disorder, 913 titles were generated by the
search terms, and 148 were examined closely. Many studies
were eliminated because they included only those persons
under treatment for alcohol abuse/dependence. Only seven
of these studies met the above criteria. Mortality relative
risk rates ranged from 1.4 in the United States to 3.3 in
Norway. Two of the seven studies were conducted outside
the United States (i.e., in France and Norway), and both
were in the high quartile.
Population-based studies focusing on mortality among
individuals with drug use disorders are almost nonexistent.
For drug use disorder, the search yielded 610 titles, but most
were eliminated because they included only those persons
under treatment for drug abuse/dependence. Two studies
met our criteria, and both were from the United States (mor-
tality relative risks of 1.6 and 2.3).
For the study of schizophrenia, the review of McGrath
et al. was used (25). The median relative risk in 38 studies
was 2.6.
For bipolar disorder, we found no population-based sur-
vey studies of mortality, so we included three studies from
population-based registers. The median relative risk for the
three was 2.6.
For the study of mortality related to dementia, 15 studies
were selected from the review of Dewey and Saz (37), and
four later studies (one with two sites) were added. Many
studies were eliminated because they did not report the rel-
ative odds or standardized mortality ratio for the total sample
over 65 years of age. Others were excluded because they did
not diagnose according to operational criteria. The median
relative risk for mortality associated with dementia was 2.7.
DISABILITY AND COSTS
Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have the highest dis-
ability ratings according to the methodology of the GBD
Study (0.53 and 0.40, respectively), and bipolar disorder
also includes 83 percent with severe disability on one or
more of the four areas in the SDS. It is difficult to imagine
what the results would be if the SDS methodology had been
applied to persons meeting criteria for schizophrenia, since
they may lack insight into their condition. Major depressive
disorder is next in both the GBD (rating of 0.35 for the
``moderate'' form) and SDS (58 percent reporting severe
disability) method. Thus, major depressive disorder com-
pares roughly with multiple sclerosis (0.41) or deafness
(0.33) in the GBD rating. Major depressive disorder in the
so-called severe form has a rating of 0.62, identical to that
for blindness. Panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive dis-
order reveal moderately high disability according to the
SDS methods but not according to the GBD method (0.17
for panic disorder, 0.13 for obsessive-compulsive disorder
compared with a rating of 0.21 for rheumatoid arthritis). The
SDS measures contrast with the disability weights used in
the GBD studies presumably because the GBD disability
weights are ratings by others, whereas the SDS ratings
are from the individual. For example, panic disorder may
be quite impairing from the point of view of the individual
(47 percent with severe impairment on the SDS) but not
be disabling and socially disruptive in the way that bipolar
disorder (GBD rating of 0.40) or schizophrenia (0.53) is.
Other measures of burden, such as self-assessed distress,
might yield different ranks. For example, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, with a relatively low GBD rating but
a high SDS percentage, might be highly distressing to the
individual but less impairing and socially disruptive com-
pared with these other measures, and this difference would
have been revealed if we had been able to find and include
a parallel set of measures for this aspect of burden.
The cost estimates in our review are based on single
studies, in many cases the only study of costs available for
that disorder. The estimates reveal considerable variation
across disorders, from $11 billion per year for simple phobia
to more than $200 billion per year for alcohol use disorders
or drug use disorders. These estimates are composed of di-
rect and indirect costs. The direct costs are mostly treatment
costs, and only a minority of individuals with the disorders
reviewed received treatment (with the possible exception of
severe disorders such as schizophrenia). The only study of
personality disorders (38) estimated costs for personality
disorders in treatment, but, since we had no estimate of
the percentage with this diagnosis who need treatment or
could benefit from it, we did not include the results in table 3
(which would be $446 billion per year in the United States if
every person with the disorder were to receive treatment).
The indirect costs reflect all persons with the disorders,
whether or not in treatment, and it is not clear whether
treatment would be effective if applied to all cases of a dis-
order. The upshot of these considerations is that the cost
estimates in table 3 may underestimate the direct costs that
would occur if all persons with the disorder were to receive
treatment but possibly overestimate the indirect costs that
would be saved if all persons were treated. The cost
estimates are from diverse sources, with a wide range of
methodologies, involving numerous assumptions; and the
number of estimates is limited. Therefore, they should be
considered provisional.
The estimates for costs are complex functions of the prev-
alence and disability associated with the disorder, the costs
of treatment, and the indirect costs. The lowest annual cost
estimate in table 3 is for obsessive-compulsive disorder
($10.6 billion per year), which is associated with lower
6 Eaton et al.
Epidemiol Rev 2008;30:1­14
disability than other disorders and is also uncommon. The
phobias have low associated disability but are slightly more
common, yielding somewhat higher cost estimates ($15.7
billion for social phobia and $11.0 billion for simple pho-
bia). Panic disorder is rare but has higher associated SDS
severity, also with higher costs ($30.4 billion). For rare dis-
orders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the costs
for a single year in the United States are $70 billion or more,
presumably because of the high associated disability. Major
depressive disorder has high costs that result from its rela-
tively high prevalence and the moderate-to-severe level of
disability associated with it. The surprising numbers in table
3 are the costs associated with alcohol and drug disorders,
both taken from a single study funded by the US govern-
ment (39). The three externalizing disorders (drug and al-
cohol disorders (table 3) and personality disorders
(discussed above but not shown in table 3) involve costs
to others and to society that are smaller or do not exist for
the other conditions.
DISCUSSION
As a group, mental disorders have a high prevalence, in
general, compared with many other health conditions. Even
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with the lowest preva-
lences among the disorders considered here (i.e., <1 per-
cent), have a higher prevalence than many other diseases
and health conditions. These relatively less common disor-
ders have high associated impairment. These two disorders
might be termed the ``less common and severe mental dis-
orders.'' Three other disorders--panic disorder, obsessive-
compulsive disorder, and drug abuse or dependence--also
have a median prevalence of less than 2 percent and might
thus be considered ``less common.'' Of these three, drug
abuse and/or dependence has nontrivial consequences, in-
cluding a GBD disability weight of 0.25, a median relative
risk of mortality of 2.0, and an estimated annual cost of over
$200 billion. Major depressive disorder, the phobias, and
alcohol abuse or dependence have median prevalence rates
of more than 5 percent and are the ``common'' mental dis-
orders. Major depressive disorder stands apart from these
because of its high associated impairment, either by the
GBD rating or the percentage with extreme disability on
the SDS scale, which explains its place in the GBD Study
as the mental disorder claiming the highest percentage of
disability-adjusted life years. A surprise in these compara-
tive results is the high median prevalence of personality
disorder, at more than 9 percent, as well as the high associ-
ated mortality risk, with a median relative odds of 4.0.

The Burden of Mental Disorders 7
Epidemiol Rev 2008;30:1­14
The comparative data reveal stark gaps in the research
literature, in that there are almost no data at all concern-
ing mortality risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder or
for simple or social phobia and only two known studies
on mortality associated with panic disorder, drug abuse or
dependence, or personality disorder. The relatively high
prevalence of personality disorder contrasts with the scar-
city of data on its prevalence, associated mortality, and
cost.
Almost all of the studies included in tables 1 and 2 were
conducted during the so-called third generation of psychi-
atric epidemiologic research, which was inaugurated with
the National Institute of Mental Health Epidemiologic
Catchment Area Program (6, 7) and includes a number of
studies using similar methodologies around the world (e.g.,
Bland et al. (40)), including an entire separate body of work
following the National Comorbidity Survey (41), with ad-
ditional recent results of many national surveys from the
World Mental Health 2000 Study (42, 43) included in table 1.
This feature of the review results from the requirement for
structured diagnostic interviews such as the Diagnostic In-
terview Schedule (44) and its descendants, including the
Composite International Diagnostic Interview Schedule
(45). These and other similar instruments are reliable but
connect only moderately well to the results of a psychiatric
interview (13, 46). However, they are the only alternatives
for population-based studies in the field of psychiatric epi-
demiology in which such a large percentage of cases do not
seek or obtain treatment.
In 1996 it was reported, with respect to the GBD Study,
that ``our understanding of the descriptive epidemiology of
many, if not most, conditions is not advanced'' (9, p. 42).
Have we remedied that situation, at least with respect to the
psychiatric conditions? Can we possibly conclude that the
third generation of research is complete, since there now is
such a strong body of global research on the prevalence of
mental disorders? While the prevalence of mental disor-
ders has been well studied, this review shows that data on
the simplest aspect of disability--death--is limited or
nonexistent for many disorders. Even keeping within the
confines of purely descriptive epidemiology, there are
meager results from population-based research concerning
the natural history of disorders, such as incidence and
symptomatic course, not considered in this review, even
though these indicators of the population dynamics of
mental disorders are vital to understanding the burden of
disease and the implications of various types of preven-
tion strategies. The papers in this issue of Epidemiologic
Reviews display a range of research with considerable
breadth and depth in analytic and experimental epidemi-
ology, moving considerably beyond counting cases. The
existence of this issue of Epidemiologic Reviews--the
second devoted to psychiatric disorders (47)--is evidence
of maturity in the field of psychiatric epidemiology.
Perhaps the era of ``generations'' is complete, in that the
field of psychiatry has successfully been integrated into the
field of epidemiology--something that had not happened
as of 1981 when the Epidemiologic Catchment Area was
started. Even with these signs of progress, however, much
remains to be done.
