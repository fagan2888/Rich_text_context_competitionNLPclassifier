The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP) is based on the premise that health is produced
in an intimate dyad embedded in a larger social network
of kin and close associates within a cultural context. The
study was designed to test the overarching hypothesis
that individuals with strong, functioning sexual and inti-
mate relationships will have better trajectories of health
and well-being than those whose relationships function
less well or who lack such relationships. Wave I of
NSHAP provides the baseline from which we measure
sexuality, health, and functioning. Thus, measurement of
sexuality and intimacy was central to the study.
This paper outlines the variety of measures of sexuality
and intimacy available in NSHAP, including sexual activi-
ties, sexual problems, attitudes toward sex and sexuality,
satisfaction with sex, characteristics of the sexual partners
and the quality of the partnership, and nonsexual intimacy.
We develop a series of measures of each of these dimen-
sions, provide descriptive statistics on each measure, eval-
uatetheirstrengthandweaknesses,anddescribedifferences
by age and gender.
For each of these measures, we describe the questions
asked of NSHAP respondents to elicit pertinent informa-
tion, present tabulations of the measure by age and gender,
and describe results of tests of the linearity and nonlinearity
of the relationship between the measure and age, separately
for men and women.
Sexual Partnerships
We broadly define sexuality as the dynamic outcome
of physical capacity, motivation, attitudes, opportunity for
partnership, and sexual conduct (Bullivant et al., 2004; Lindau,
Laumann, Levinson, & Waite, 2003; Spencer, Feldman,
Clark, & Weisstein, 2004). As such, it represents an essen-
tial nexus for the interaction among social life; culturally
determined beliefs and practices; psychological processes;
and the biological mechanisms of aging, health, and dis-
ease. Sexual activity and functioning are determined by the
interaction of each partner's sexual capacity, motivation,
conduct, and attitudes and are further shaped by the quality
and condition of the dyadic relationship itself.
For older adults in the generations represented in NSHAP,
marriage provides the social and emotional context for the
vast majority of all sexual activity. Marriage also provides op-
portunity for intimacy and affects physical and emotional sat-
isfaction with sex (Waite & Joyner, 2001). At younger ages,
virtually all married men and women are sexually active, and
married people show substantially higher rates of sexual
activity than the unmarried (Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, &
Michaels, 1994). Marriage is an important predictor of physi-
cal and mental health for both men and women and also seems
to affect financial well-being (Bennett, 2005; Ellis, 2008;
Horwitz & White, 1991; Horwitz, White, & Howell-White,
1996; Hu & Goldman, 1990; Ross, 1995; Ross, Mirowsky, &
Goldsteen, 1990; Waite, 1995; Waite & Gallagher, 2000).
Sexuality: Measures of Partnerships, Practices, Attitudes,
and Problems in the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Study

Objectives. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) was designed to examine the relationship
between sexual behavior, sexual problems, and health among older women and men. We describe measures of sexual part-
nerships, sexual practices, sexual problems, attitudes toward sex, and nonsexual intimacy in the first wave of NSHAP.
Methods. We compare measures of sexuality for those 57­85 years old, by age, separately for men and women. We
construct scales of sexual mores, sexual interest, and relationship satisfaction and discuss properties of each scale.
Results. Sexuality among older adults tends to vary with age and gender. At all ages in this study, men are more likely
than women to have a partner, more likely to be sexually active with that partner, and tend to have more positive and
permissive attitudes toward sex. The proportions in a sexual partnership, behavior, problems, and attitudes all differ sub-
stantially by age. And these age patterns often differ for men and women.
Discussion. Data obtained in the NSHAP can be used to construct key measures of sexuality among older adults; to
examine sexuality itself; and to explore the link between sexuality, health, well-being, and other dimensions of the lives
of older adults.
Key Words: Sexual function--Sexual practices--Sexuality.
SEXUALITY IN NSHAP i57
Other Partnerships
To allow for the possibility that some older adults may be
involved in a romantic relationship that does not involve
sex, respondents were initially asked about their current
marital status; those who answered something other than
"married" or "living with a partner" were then asked, "Do
you currently have a romantic, intimate, or sexual partner?"
The spouse, cohabiting partner, or other (noncohabiting) ro-
mantic/intimate partner identified in this way was desig-
nated as the current partner, and many of the subsequent
questions focused explicitly on this relationship.
A complete marital history was obtained from all respon-
dents in the same manner used by the 1992 Health and Re-
tirement Survey; this included the start and end dates (month
and year) of every marriage and the way in which each pre-
vious marriage ended (i.e., divorce, widowhood, or separa-
tion). A complete cohabiting history was also obtained
using questions designed specifically for NSHAP. For each
marriage, respondents were asked whether they had lived
with their spouse prior to getting married and, if so, the
month and year in which they started living together. For
marriages that ended in divorce or separation, respondents
were also asked for the month and year in which they
stopped living together. In addition, respondents were also
asked to enumerate all previous nonmarital, cohabiting rela-
tionships and, for each, to indicate the month and year in
which they started and stopped living together.
Although some surveys have obtained a complete sexual
partner history (e.g., National Health and Social Life Sur-
vey [NHSLS; Laumann et al., 1994], Chicago Health and
Social Life Survey [CHSLS; Laumann, Ellingson, Mahay,
& Paik, 2004]), there was not sufficient time during the
NSHAP interview to do this. Instead, NSHAP adapted the
approach used in the NHSLS and the CHSLS to focus on
respondents' sexual relationships during the past 5 years.
This included the current spouse, cohabiting partner, or ro-
mantic/intimate partner and either one or two of the next
most recent spouses or cohabiting partners within the past
5 years for a maximum of two partners overall. In addition,
up to three additional next most recent sexual partners
within the past 5 years were also included. Thus, the desig-
nated current partner, the most recent spouse or cohabiting
partner (if one exists within the past 5 years), and the three
most recent sexual partners within the past 5 years were
always included. For each partnership, respondents were
asked the month and year of both first (except for marriages
and cohabiting partnerships that began more than 5 years
ago) and most recent sex, the gender and age (relative to
the respondent) of the partner, and whether the respondent
expects to have sex with the partner again.
Because NSHAP limited the number of sexual partners
for which information on the timing of sex was collected,
the data set is not well suited for computing the total number
of sexual partners within a fixed period of time (it should be
noted, however, that given the relatively low rate of partner
acquisition among older adults, the limited 5 year history is
effectively complete for the large majority of respondents).
However, it is possible to calculate the total number of sex-
ual partners in the past 5 years for all respondents (subject
only to missing data), and a self-administered questionnaire
given to all respondents asked separately for the lifetime
number of male and female sexual partners.
Table 1 illustrates how the NSHAP data set may be used
to estimate the prevalence of various types of partnerships
over different periods of time. The likelihood of having a
current partner decreases with age, due primarily to a drop
in the percentage married (Lindau et al., 2007). In addition,
in each age group, men are more likely to have a current
partner than are women, with the largest difference in the
oldest age group. This difference reflects the higher mortal-
ity rate among men and the age differential between spouses.
The rate of acquisition of new partners is relatively low,
with roughly 3% of men and less than 1% of women report-
ing multiple partners during the previous year. For both
men and women, the percentage reporting more than two
lifetime heterosexual partnerships decreases with age; the
low rate of new partner acquisition suggests that this is at
least in part a cohort effect (Laumann et al., 1994). By con-
trast, the percentages reporting at least one same-sex part-
nership over the lifetime--4% of men and 5% of women
overall--are similar across the age groups. Finally, the per-
centage of both men and women who ever cohabited
steadily increases in each younger age group, reflecting a
well-documented increase in the likelihood of cohabitation
over time (Raley, 2000).
Sexual Activity and Sexual Behaviors
Respondents who reported that they had engaged in
partnered sex in the past 12 months were asked a series of
questions about the frequency of sex with their husband or
wife, cohabiting partner, or other partner; how often sex
included vaginal intercourse; how often during vaginal in-
tercourse they used a condom; how often they participated
in oral sex; and how often sex included hugging, kissing, or
other ways of sexual touching. These questions were taken
directly from the National Health and Social Life Study
(Laumann et al., 1994)
Table 2 shows the prevalence of sexual activity and sexual
behaviors, by age, for men and women. At ages 57­64 years,
the youngest ages in our sample, 84% of men and 62% of
women report having had sex with a partner in the past year.
By the oldest ages in our sample, 75­85 years, a minority--
38% of men and 17% of women--are sexually active by this
definition. We also examined the linear--and, in separate
analysis not shown, nonlinear--relationship of sexual activ-
ity with age for men and women.The results suggest a smooth
decline in likelihood of partnered sex with age for women
and men, both those with and those without partners, with
only a negative linear age effect significant (at p < .001).

Although fewer adults are sexually active at older than at
younger ages, those who remain sexually active report hav-
ing partnered sex fairly often and these rates remain remark-
ably constant through ages 65­75 years and fall only
modestly at the oldest ages, when about a quarter of the
sexually active men and women said that they have sex once
or twice a week or more. Also, although the trend tests for
this variable in Table 2 demonstrate a highly significant lin-
ear decline among men and a moderately significant decline
among women, at least among the latter, our supplemental
analysis suggests a nonlinear decline--with a positive
quadratic age effect (p < .10) suggesting a plateauing of
frequent sex with age.
A very high proportion of NSHAP respondents, like
younger respondents in the 1992 National Health and So-
cial Life Study (Laumann et al., 1994), report that they usu-
ally or always have vaginal intercourse when they have sex.
Among the youngest respondents in our sample, 87% of
women and 91% of men say that vaginal sex is usually or
always part of sexual activity. For the oldest respondents,
vaginal intercourse seems to be included in their activities
somewhat less often, with 75% of women, aged 75­85
years, and 84% of men this age saying that they usually or
always have vaginal intercourse during sex. Our trend tests
suggest that a woman's age is not significantly associated
with her likelihood of vaginal sex. Among men, in contrast,
supplemental analysis indicates that the effect may be cur-
vilinear, with a positive quadratic effect (p < .05) suggesting
that men's likelihood of vaginal intercourse during sex does
not fall below a "baseline," even among the oldest old. By
contrast, the frequency with which men and women engage
in hugging, kissing, or other sexual touching, which we la-
bel "foreplay," is virtually identical at all ages. Specifically,
likelihood of foreplay is not correlated with a woman's age
in any specification, whereas for men, we find only a weakly
significant (p < .10) linear decline. In fact, foreplay and
vaginal intercourse seem to constitute the two activities
necessary for respondents to label what they did as "sex."
And vaginal intercourse seems to become more optional
with age.
Table 2 shows the frequency with which men and women
report that they ever participated in oral sex--whether giv-
ing or receiving--in the preceding year. Oral sex is a less
common activity during partnered sex than either foreplay
or vaginal intercourse, with 62% of men and 53% of women
aged 57­64 years reporting that they had any oral sex, com-
pared with 28% of men and 36% of women aged 75­85
years. These frequencies are consistent with those from the
NHSLS for men and women in their 50s (Laumann et al.,
1994, Table 3.6). One could speculate that perhaps older
adults substitute oral sex for vaginal intercourse at older
ages, as a result of changes in functionality or poor health,
but Table 2 shows that this is not the case because of the
proportion of both men and women reporting that oral sex is

SEXUALITY IN NSHAP i59
lower at older than at younger ages. Additionally, our trend
tests also support a smooth linear decline in likelihood of
oral sex among both women (p < .05) and men (p < .001). It
appears that at the oldest ages sexual activity consists en-
tirely of kissing, hugging, and sexual touching more often
than it does at younger ages.
These differences by age in inclusion of oral sex in sex-
ual activities could result from cohort differences in pat-
terns of sexual behavior established at younger ages and
carried over into old age. The youngest NSHAP respon-
dents are part of the Baby Boom and experienced the sexual
revolution. The oldest respondents were teenagers during
the 1940s, a period of more conservative sexual mores
(Joyner & Laumann, 2001). The age differences we observe
could also result from changes in sexual repertories that oc-
cur with age, perhaps as a result of changes in health and
functioning.
We can think of frequency of masturbation as indexing
a person's underlying level of sexual interest. Table 2
shows differences between age groups in the prevalence
of masturbation that track differences between these same
groups in the prevalence of oral sex, especially for men.
These differences are consistent with previous studies
on younger age groups in both the United States (Das,
2007) and other countries (Das; Dekker & Schmidt, 2002;
Kontula & Haavio-Mannila, 1995), which suggest that
masturbation among the elderly participant does not com-
pensate for a lack of "real" sex, with 63% of men aged
57­64 years (those with the most partnered sex) reporting
any masturbation in the preceding year, compared with
28% of men aged 75­85 years (those with the least sex).
For women, the comparable figures are 32% and 16%.
In addition, especially among women, the sharp break
in masturbation prevalence between those who were aged
57­64 years in 2005 (and thus came of age during or after
the sexual revolution of the 1960s) and older groups
seems indicative more of a cohort than age effect, consis-
tent with previous studies on both the United States (Das,
2007; Laumann et al., 1994; Laumann & Youm, 2001)
and Europe (Kontula & Haavio-Mannila, 2002), which
have also noted this break for the same cohort at younger
ages. This conclusion is also supported by our supple-
mental analysis, which finds a weak but positive quadratic
effect for women and a weak negative quadratic effect
among men (both significant at p < .10), suggesting a
smooth decline following an initial "hump" around age
60. Additionally, the NSHAP prevalence for this young-
est group is markedly higher than among women in a
similar age range in the 1992 NHSLS (Laumann et al.),
who came of age well before the sexual revolution, also
suggesting that cohort rather than biological age is the
underlying factor. It is possible, however, that this last
discrepancy is due to a period effect (Hobcraft, Menken,
& Preston, 1982) such that women's masturbation likeli-
hood was lower in 1992 than in 2005, at least among the
elderly women.

Sexual Attitudes
Attitudes toward sex are both a product and a cause of social
and sexual experiences, choices, and behaviors. These atti-
tudes also depend on demographic characteristics such as race/
ethnicity, education, and gender (Laumann et al., 1994, 2004).
NSHAP respondents were asked about their attitudes toward
sex and sexuality in general and their attitudes about sex in
their current or most recent partnership.They were asked about
the importance of sex in their own lives and for maintaining a
relationship. Both the questions on attitudes toward extramari-
tal sex and those on values and beliefs were included in a
leave-behind self-administered instrument only. The items on
importance of sex were modularized and included in the leave-
behind questionnaire only for respondents not on paths in
which these items were asked during the interview.
Attitudes toward sex outside marriage.--Respondents
were asked, "Below is a list of statements. For each one,
please choose if you think this is always wrong, almost al-
ways wrong, wrong only sometimes, or not wrong at all. All
of these statements refer to adults. A married person having
sexual relations with someone other than their marriage
partner? What if the spouse is in advanced stages of demen-
tia such as Alzheimer's or other mental disease? What about
if the spouse has a serious, long-term physical illness and
cannot have sex?"
Values and beliefs.--Next, respondents were told, "For
the next set of statements, choose whether you strongly
agree, agree, disagree or strongly disagree. These are just
general statements; they are not about your specific rela-
tionship. I would not have sex with someone unless I was in
love with them. My religious beliefs have shaped and guid-
ed my sexual behavior. Satisfactory sexual relations are es-
sential to the maintenance of a relationship. The ability to
have sex decreases as a person grows older."
Importance of sex.--Respondents were asked, "For some
people sex is a very important part of their lives and for oth-
ers it is not very important at all. How important a part of
your life would you say sex is? Extremely important, very
important, moderately important, somewhat important, not
at all important. How often do you think about sex? Less
than once a month, one to a few times a month, one to a few
times a week, every day, or several times a day?" We in-
clude in this category the question on beliefs about the im-
portance of satisfactory sexual relations for the maintenance
of a relationship. Respondents were also asked, "In the past
12 months, how often did you have sex because you felt
obligated or it was your duty?" with response categories
from always to never.
Table 3 shows the attitudes toward sex by age and gen-
der, which show two general patterns, with some excep-
tions. First, men are typically more positive about sex and
sexual expression than women regardless of the circum-
stances. And, second, attitudes tend to be more conserva-
tive among older than among younger people. The
likelihood that both women and--to a lesser extent--men

consider extramarital sex "always wrong" tends to in-
crease with age, whereas the likelihood that women agree
or strongly agree that they would not have sex unless they
were in love is similar at all ages but increases with age
for men. Women's likelihood of agreeing that their reli-
gious beliefs guide their sexual behavior also increases
smoothly with age--in contrast to their belief in the ne-
cessity of sex for relationship maintenance, which de-
clines and then plateaus, as suggested by a positive
quadratic age effect (p < .05) in our supplemental analy-
sis. Among men, we only find a possible curvilinear pat-
tern (p < .10) for religious beliefs guiding sex, with
likelihood of endorsing this item rising but then leveling
off with age. Additionally, for both genders (p < .001), we
find that agreement with the statement that ability to have
sex decreases as a person grows older increases smoothly
with age.
Finally, both women and men become increasingly likely
with age to agree that sex is "not at all important," a pattern
we also see for infrequent sex thoughts for women. For
men, however, our supplemental analysis indicates that the
frequency with which they report thinking about sex falls
and then plateaus--or in other words--that there is a "base-
line" for men's sexual interest, even among the oldest old.
Among men and women, both those with partners and those
with no partner, reports of any obligatory sex decline linearly
with age.
Sexual Attitude Scales
Exploratory factor analysis of these sexual attitudes items
suggested two distinct, theoretically plausible underlying
constructs. We used simple summary indexes, consisting
only of standardized versions of items loading highly on
each factor, to capture these constructs.
Sexual Mores Scale.--The first scale, which we term
Sexual Mores, combined the three "sex outside marriage"
indicators (with these three items reverse-coded, to be sub-
stantively consistent with the construct), not having sex un-
less in love, and religious beliefs guiding sexual behavior.
This index had a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .76, with
item-rest correlations also high (.41­.65), suggesting good
internal consistency (Cronbach, 1951). Scale reliability was
similarly high when the index was operationalized sepa-
rately for women (a = .73) and men (a = .76), suggesting
stability in this attitudinal trait across genders. With a
weighted mean of 0.01, the scale for the full sample ran
from -3.39 to 1.01, with high values indicating more con-
servative views. Based on a matrix of pairwise polychoric
correlations, we also created factor scores (also running
from more liberal to less liberal) for this construct through
the regression method, for a single factor with high loadings
(between .53 and .91) for all five items. With a weighted
mean of 0.02, the scores ran from -2.95 to 0.73.
Sexual Interest Scale.--The second summary index,
which we term Sexual Interest, comprised importance of
sex and frequency of sex thoughts, with an a of .76 for the
full sample, .75 for women, and .69 for men, again suggest-
ing high scale reliability and stability across genders. For
the full sample, this scale ran from -1.53 to 2.16 (with high
values denoting more sexual interest) and had a weighted
mean of 0.05. Both the Sexual Mores Scale and the Sexual
Interest Scale are available in the publicly available NSHAP
data set.
Sexual Problems
NSHAP asked in some detail about sexual problems the
respondent had experienced for several months or more
over the past year and about the problems experienced by
the spouse or other sexual partner (Laumann, Das, & Waite,
in press). Respondents were also asked whether they avoided
sex because of these problems. These questions were taken
directly from the NHSLS (Laumann et al., 1994) with slight
modifications. If the respondent reported a problem, we
asked the extent to which he or she was bothered by this,
following a suggestion in Basson and coworkers (2000).
These questions were asked only of respondents who re-
ported having had some partnered sex in the past year. Those
who reported no sexual activity over this period were asked
the reasons that they did not. These questions came from the
CHSLS (Laumann et al., 2004). Items on reasons for not
having had sex were modularized, with respondents as-
signed to paths in which these questions were not asked in
the interview receiving a self-administered leave-behind
questionnaire including these items. Table 4 shows preva-
lence of sexual problems by gender and age. Table 5 pres-
ents primary reasons for not having sex by gender and age,
separately for those with partners (top panel) and those
without partners (bottom panel).
Consistent with previous community studies on el-
derly individuals (Blanker et al., 2001; Feldman, Goldstein,
Hatzichristou, Crane, & McKinlay, 1994), the most com-
mon sexual problem among men is erectile difficulty, re-
ported by 31% of those aged 57­65 years and by about 44%
of older men. As per our supplemental analysis, likelihood
of experiencing erectile problems appears to level off with
age--as evidenced by a significant (p < .05) and negative
quadratic effect. The next most common sexual problems,
premature climax and lack of interest in sex, are reported by
just under 30% of the youngest men. Premature climax is
less common among the oldest men, but lack of interest in
sex is equally prevalent among men of all ages. (For these
last two problems, age is not a significant correlate.) For
women, the most common sexual problem is lack of interest
in sex, which is not significantly correlated with age and is
reported by 38%­49% of women. Both failure to lubricate
and inability to climax are also common, with 33%­44% of
women reporting either of these problems. As with men's
WAITE ET AL.
i62
erectile problems, women's difficulties with lubrication ap-
pear to level off with age, as suggested by a weakly signifi-
cant (p < .10) and negative quadratic effect, indicating
perhaps a "ceiling"--whether biological or sociological--
in each case. In contrast, inorgasmia seems to increase
steeply only among the oldest women, with a positive qua-
dratic age effect significant (at p < .10). About a quarter of
sexually active women report a lack of pleasure in sex, with
this problem uncorrelated with age.
Those who reported at least one sexual problem were
asked if they ever avoided sex because of the problem.
Between 23% and 34% of sexually active women say
that they had avoided sex; comparable figures for men
are 22%­30%, with age not a significant correlate in ei-
ther case.
One of the most noteworthy features of reports of sexual
problems is their relative similarity across age groups. For
women, we see few differences between age groups in the
prevalence of any of the sexual problems we asked about
or in the proportion who avoided sex because of the prob-
lems. Women may cease sexual activity because of health
or other problems as they age, but if they continue to be
sexually active they appear not to be much more likely to
have problems with sexual function at older than at
younger ages. We see a somewhat more mixed picture for
men; both erectile problems and inability to climax are
more common at older than at younger ages, but prema-
ture climax is less common among the oldest men than
among those who are younger. And men aged 65­74 years
are more likely than younger men to lack pleasure in sex
and to have avoided sex because of problems, but the old-
est men are not. All other sexual problems are about as
prevalent among sexually active men of all ages. Thus,
sexually active older men seem to function at much the
same level as sexually active younger men, with a few
exceptions, not all of which favor younger men.

SEXUALITY IN NSHAP i63
Reasons for Not Having Sex
As noted previously, respondents who reported no sexual
activity over the preceding 3 months were asked the rea-
sons. At least among those with a partner, reasons for sexual
inactivity seem largely uncorrelated with age--although in
our supplemental analysis, we notice positive quadratic ef-
fects (i.e., a plateau after an initial decline) for women's
lack of sexual interest and, complementarily, men's reports
of their partners' lack of interest, and the inverse age pattern
(a rise followed by a leveling off) for men's reports of their
partners' poor physical health (p < .10 in each case). Addi-
tionally, men's reports of their own poor physical health lead-
ing to sexual inactivity increase linearly with age (p < .05). In
other words, for partnered women and men, when age does
influence sexual inactivity at all, it is through declining phys-
ical vitality--whether one's own or a partner's--rather than
declining interest.
In contrast, among women lacking a partner, we find a
linear rise in lack of interest (p < .01), coupled with linear
declines in lack of opportunity and not having met the right
person (p < .05 for both), given as reasons for sexual inac-
tivity. Among unpartnered men, in contrast, there is only a
negative quadratic age effect (p < .01) for not having met
the right person. In other words, a woman's lack of a partner
seems to influence a lowering of her sexual interest itself,
consistent with speculations about a greater "plasticity" of
women's erotic drive (Baumeister, 2004, 2000), whereas a
man's similar lack of an intimate partner does not lower his
interest in finding one.
Nonsexual Intimacy
Many older adults lack a partner with whom to have sex.
This is especially the case for older women. Nonsexual in-
teractions with others, however, have a demonstrable effect
on elderly individuals' mortality and morbidity (Rasulo,
Christensen, & Tomassini, 2005). We discuss measures
of nonsexual intimate contact developed specifically for
NSHAP. Respondents were asked, "In the last 12 months,
how often have you engaged in the following activities?:
Petting or touching a dog, cat or other pet? Greeting some-
one with an embrace, kiss or pat on the back? Playing or
cuddling with a grandchild or other child? Hugging, kiss-
ing, caressing or other close physical contact with partner
(skipped if no partner)? Hugging, kissing, caressing or other
close physical contact with another adult?" Close physical
contact with others, then, is used as an indicator of nonsex-
ual intimacy. These questions were modularized and in-
cluded either in the self-administered leave-behind
questionnaire or during the interview, depending on the path
to which the respondent was assigned.
Table 6 shows the prevalence of nonsexual intimacy by
age and gender for each of these measures. The most com-
mon type of close physical contact for both men and women
is greeting someone with a hug or kiss; a very sizeable ma-
jority report this activity once a month or more, although
fewer of the oldest women report this type of intimacy than
younger women. Specifically, our trend tests suggest that
this activity becomes linearly less likely as women grow
older (p = .001) but has no age pattern among men. Touch-
ing a pet and playing or cuddling with a grandchild or an-
other child are also both quite common, especially among
younger respondents, and less so among the oldest respon-
dents--with women's and men's reports of touching pets
and women's cuddling of children all declining smoothly
with age (p < .001 in each case). Fewer adults have pets at
older ages, apparently, and the grandchildren of respondents
in their 70s and 80s are probably more often teenagers or
older and therefore may be less inclined to be cuddled.
Close physical contact with another adult not a partner
declines linearly with age for women (p < .01), but not for
men, perhaps because fewer men report this activity at any
age. We see a pattern of differentials in nonsexual intimacy
that mirrors differentials in sexual activity; 90% or more of
women and men with a partner hug or hold that partner
fairly often, with this likelihood declining only mildly with
age (p < .05). But the proportion of all men and women who

hug or hold a partner falls substantially with age for men
and dramatically with age among women (p < .001 for both)
as a result of the decline in the share of those with partners,
especially for women. It is worrisome that at the same ages
during which older adults, especially women, have reduced
access to spouses or other partners they also seem to have
reduced access to these forms of nonsexual intimacy. The
age differences among women are especially pronounced.
These patterns may reflect differences across cohorts in the
types of intimacy with which people feel comfortable; they
may also reflect changes in expressions of intimacy over the
life course.
It would be convenient both analytically and conceptu-
ally to create a single measure of nonsexual intimacy. How-
ever, the items in Table 6 do not form a single scale, and we
were unsuccessful in attempts to create subscales.
Relationship Quality
Sexual expression is both a component and a consequence
of the satisfaction that the partners feel with the relation-
ship. Respondents were asked the extent to which they like
to spend time with their partner. They were also asked how
often: they can open up to him or her about worries, they
can rely on the partner, the partner makes too many de-
mands, or the partner criticizes. Respondents were also
asked to rate the quality of their relationships and how emo-
tionally and physically satisfying they find their relation-
ship with their partner to be. Respondents were also asked
about satisfaction with the frequency of sex with the part-
ner. We develop and evaluate measures of relationship qual-
ity in NSHAP, shown in Table 7.
Most women and men say that they can often open up to
their partner about worries and can rely on the partner. No
more than about 1 in 10 thinks the partner often makes too
many demands or often criticizes. Few people evaluate their
most recent relationship as unhappy, not emotionally satis-
fying, not physically satisfying, or involving more sex than
the person would like. With the exception of being able to
open up to the partner among men (p < .05) and reliance
upon the partner among women (p < .10), both of which
decline smoothly as a person gets older, none of these indi-
cators seem to be patterned by age.
Relationship Satisfaction Scale.--As with sexual atti-
tudes, we investigated the scaling potential of these items,
with exploratory factor analysis suggesting a theoretically
plausible latent construct comprising happiness in the re-
lationship as well as emotional and physical satisfaction in the
relationship. We created a summary index for standardized
values of these three items, which we term Relationship
Satisfaction. Cronbach's alpha for this scale was .80 (.82 for
women and .74 for men), suggesting high scale reliability.
With a weighted mean of 0.03, this scale ran from -3.18
to 0.98, with high values indicating more satisfaction. The
Relationship Satisfaction Scale is included in the publicly
available data set.
Discussion
Partnered sex requires two people who are willing and
able to participate. As men and women age, their spouses or
other partners tend to age too, altering the dyad within which
sexuality is expressed. The NSHAP can be used to construct
key measures of sexuality among older adults. In addition,
NSHAP data contain detailed measures of the relationship
context in which this behavior may occur. The data contain
a good deal of information about current marital, cohabiting
and romantic relationships, and link sexual behavior to
a specific relationship. NSHAP contains information on

sexual problems experienced by the respondents. Although
we do not report these data here, respondents were asked the
same questions about sexual problems that their spouse or
partner was experiencing as about their own. Respondents
also rated their own physical and emotional health and that
of their spouse or partner. And they provided ratings of their
relationship across a range of dimensions. The rich and de-
tailed information on both partners allows researchers to
contextualize sexuality at older ages within relationships, as
do respondents' evaluations of the relationship itself.
Dimensions of sexuality lie at the heart of the NSHAP
data. But the data also contain detailed, innovative, and rich
measures of physical health, physiological functioning,
emotional well-being, social networks, illness, and disease.
These measures are discussed in detail elsewhere in this
volume. Together, data on sexuality and on many factors
linked to sexual behavior, sexual partnerships, sexual atti-
tudes, and sexual problems allow researchers to examine
sexuality itself and to explore the link between sexuality,
health, well-being, and other dimensions of the lives of
older adults.
