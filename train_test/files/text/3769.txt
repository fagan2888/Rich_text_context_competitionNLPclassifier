Abstract
The aim of this research was to analyze the inconsistency in responses to survey questions within the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) regarding insurance coverage of dental services. Self-reports of dental coverage in the dental services section
were compared with those in the insurance section of the 2002 HRS to identify inconsistent responses. Logistic regression
identified characteristics of persons reporting discrepancies and assessed the effect of measurement error on dental coverage
coefficient estimates in dental utilization models. In 18% of cases, data reported in the insurance section contradicted data
reported in the dental use section of the HRS by those who said insurance at least partially covered (or would have covered)
their (hypothetical) dental use. Additional findings included distinct characteristics of persons with potential reporting errors
and a downward bias to the regression coefficient for coverage in a dental use model without controls for inconsistent self-
reports of coverage. This study offers evidence for the need to validate self-reports of dental insurance coverage among a
survey population of older Americans to obtain more accurate estimates of coverage and its impact on dental utilization.

Introduction
Response variance or unreliability is introduced in surveys
when sampled individuals provide different answers to the
same question asked more than once in the survey. Response
variance is only one example of measurement errors in sur-
veys.1 The presence of measurement error from inconsistent
or unreliable reporting of the explanatory variables in a
regression model poses estimation problems that may cause
potentially downward biased, inconsistent estimates of the
regression coefficients.2,3
Previous studies have addressed disagreements between
survey measurements of public and private health insurance
coverage from alternate sources for nonelderly populations.
Black et al estimated a 34% downward bias in a wage growth
model for the health insurance coefficient from using
employee reports of group health insurance coverage instead
of the 79% of employee responses that agreed with the
employer verification of coverage status.4 Hill used up to
four sources of data including insurance cards, policy book-
lets, medical providers, and employers and insurance compa-
nies, to verify self-reports of health insurance coverage status
for 97% of household members in the 1996 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).5 Call et al estimated
from the 2004 Medicaid Undercounts Experiments (MUE)
data that between 13% and 20% of surveyed known Medicaid
beneficiaries across three states reported no Medicaid cover-
age at all while 3% to 13% of them in these states reported no
coverage from any source.6
Cafferata verified 70.9% of self-reports of dental service
coverage by elderly household members 65 and older
against policy documentation collected from employers
and insurance providers in the 1977 National Medical Care
Expenditure Survey (NMCES). Of the 8.8% self-reporting
dental coverage in the household survey, 40% lacked vali-
dated coverage. Correct household survey responses were
(1) correlated positively with household income and nega-
tively with a person's age, and (2) were more prevalent
among whites than non-whites and among those with
Medicare and private insurance than other medical insurance
coverage.7

2 INQUIRY
A longitudinal survey of older Americans over 50 years of
age was used in our study to identify response inconsistency
to survey questions regarding insurance coverage of dental
services. In each of four recent waves of the survey adminis-
tered at 2-year intervals between 2002 and 2008, individuals
were asked about dental coverage associated with their use
of dental services. Those who did not use dental services
were queried as to whether services would have been cov-
ered by insurance. In Wave 6 covering the survey period
2000 to 2002, respondents were also asked in a separate sec-
tion of the survey if they had any dental insurance. Recent
studies of dental use and coverage using these data relied
solely on questions regarding dental coverage available only
in the dental use section of the survey.8-14 Our preliminary
estimates showed disproportionately higher rates of cover-
age than expected among certain population subgroups of
non-users of dental services in the data used for these studies.
This suggested that certain groups of older Americans might
mistakenly believe that Medicare covered dental services.
However, Medicare does not routinely cover dental care with
the exception of a small but growing percentage of beneficia-
ries in Medicare Advantage programs who may or may not
receive this coverage.15-18
In our study, persons with response inconsistencies and
their personal characteristics are identified, and the impact of
estimates of dental coverage on the likelihood of dental use
with and without controls for potential errors in measuring
dental coverage is analyzed. Response errors in reporting
dental coverage are hypothesized as follows: (1) to not be
equally distributed across population groups, (2) to be higher
among non-users of dental services, and (3) to deflate esti-
mates of dental coverage in dental use regression models.
Methods
The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a nationally rep-
resentative longitudinal household survey in the United
States that collects self-reported data from interviews with
individuals over age 50 and their spouses every 2 years. We
use the 2002 (Wave 6) installment of the HRS for our study
containing 18 469 sampled individuals. Administered by the
Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University of
Michigan and sponsored by the National Institute on Aging,
the HRS is useful for the study of aging, retirement, and
health among older populations in the United States.19,20
Each respondent is asked a large battery of questions includ-
ing information about demographics; income and assets;
physical and mental health; cognition, family structure, and
social supports; health care utilization and costs; health
insurance coverage; labor force status and job history; and
retirement planning and expectations. Because of the breadth
of data available across health and labor force measures and
the large sample of older Americans, the HRS is an excellent
data source for assessing the association between dental cov-
erage, use, and retirement among an older population.
This analysis focuses on the consistency of self-reported
dental insurance coverage in the HRS. In 2002, dental cover-
age was determined in the survey three possible ways: (1)
Persons who visited the dentist for dental care at least once
during the 2-year period prior to the survey were classified as
covered if they reported that their expenses were covered
completely, mostly, or partially by insurance; (2) persons not
visiting the dentist were considered to have dental coverage
if they reported that insurance would have covered any of
their expenses had they visited the dentist; and (3) finally, in
the insurance section of the questionnaire, all persons were
asked directly whether they had any insurance covering den-
tal bills. Those answering yes were asked if they had cover-
age from one of the plans previously described or a different
plan. If using a previous plan, they were asked to identify
which plan.
We identify persons with inconsistent reports of dental
coverage in Wave 6 as those who reported having coverage
in (1) or (2) above but not having coverage in (3) above.
Persons reporting coverage in (1) or (2) but reporting dental
coverage from Medicare in (3) are also classified as inconsis-
tent cases, although any persons in Medicare Advantage
plans offering dental coverage could potentially be misclas-
sified as inconsistent cases. Persons reporting coverage in (2)
but who were unable to answer the direct insurance question
in (3) or questions regarding the plan or type of plan offering
them coverage are also classified as inconsistent cases.
Persons reporting no dental coverage by either (1) or (2) who
reported dental coverage in (3) from a private plan, Medicaid,
Champus, a previous plan not on the list, or a different plan
not previously mentioned are also classified as inconsistent
cases.
Survey respondents are designated as fully retired if at the
time of the survey interview they were not working for pay
or self-employed and either (1) said that they were com-
pletely retired or (2) reported their sole employment status as
retired. Individuals are classified as partially retired if they
were not fully retired but report retirement and either work-
ing or looking for work. Individuals not classified as fully or
partly retired are designated as in the labor force if they
report working for pay or report their labor force status as
working full-time, part-time, or unemployed. Persons are
classified as not retired and out of the labor force if they
report being disabled, not in the labor force or never in the
labor force.
The wealth measure we use is the total net value of wealth
including the net value of any secondary residence owned by
the household. The HRS collects data on separate compo-
nents of wealth and debt and then sums them to produce a
total net value of wealth. Responses are bracketed for cases
in which respondents cannot provide exact data to improve
the accuracy of imputed values.20-22
We calculate Z tests for the differences between mean per-
centages reporting consistent and inconsistent dental cover-
age for specific population subgroups defined by selected
Moeller et al 3
individual and household characteristics. We also estimate a
logistic regression model of the likelihood of inconsistently
reporting dental coverage as a function of these same person-
level and household characteristics. Finally, we estimate
separate logistic models of dental service use with and with-
out controls for inconsistent reporting of dental coverage and
with controls for other potentially confounding variables
including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status,
household size, health status, body mass index, household
income, household wealth, Census region, and retirement/
labor force status.
The HRS core sample design is a multistage area proba-
bility sample of households, so all estimates and statistics
reported were computed taking into account this design with
the use of the software packages SUDAAN and STATA.23,24
Unless otherwise stated, all reported results are significant at
the .05 level.
Results
Inconsistent Cases
In Table 1, we show for Wave 6 how we classified persons
reporting their dental coverage status in the dental use sec-
tion of the survey as consistent or inconsistent reporting
based on their responses in the insurance section of the
survey.
Notably in Table 1, 1111 or 18.1% of the 6144 persons
reporting coverage in the dental use section were classified
as inconsistent cases. The inconsistent rates for those report-
ing coverage were higher for those non-users answering
positively to the hypothetical coverage question (30%) com-
pared with users saying that dental insurance at least partially
covered their dental services (14%). One-fifth of all incon-
sistently reported dental coverage cases reported Medicare
as their coverage source with a slightly higher rate reported
among non-users (23%) than users (17%) of dental services.
Of the 10 013 reporting no dental coverage in the dental use
section of the survey, only 241 or 2.4% reported contradic-
tory responses in the insurance section.
Personal Characteristics
Tables 2 and 3 highlight the personal and household attri-
butes distinguishing persons reporting dental coverage con-
sistently in each section of the survey from those who report
contradictory information in the two sections of the survey.
In Table 2, comparisons are made between consistent and
inconsistent reporters of dental coverage across covariates,
whereas in Table 3, logistic regression estimates of charac-
teristics of inconsistent reporters are provided that were
adjusted by controls for other covariates.
Unadjusted results. In Table 2, persons reporting dental cover-
age inconsistently can be generally characterized as aged 65
to 69; Hispanic or black, non-Hispanic; not a high school
graduate; not married; in fair or poor health; living in poor,
low income, lowest wealth households not of size 2; and fully
retired with a relatively high number of chronic conditions.
They are also characterized as persons with a relatively high
number of difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs).
Adjusted results.The logistic regression results in Table 3
confirm that persons reporting dental coverage inconsis-
tently are more likely to be black, non-Hispanic than white,
non-Hispanic; fully retired, partly retired, or not retired and
not in the labor force than not retired and in the labor force;
living in households not in the highest wealth decile; and
having more rather than fewer difficulties with ADLs. We
also found them more likely to be aged 65 to 69 than under
age 65; other, non-Hispanic than white, non-Hispanic;
divorced, separated, or never married than married; and liv-
ing in the northeast Census region rather than in the southern
region. Influences of education, household size and income,
and health status and number of chronic conditions from the
unadjusted results were not found after controls were intro-
duced in the logistic regressions.
Dental Use
In Table 4, we show the influence of controlling for inconsis-
tent reporting of dental coverage on coefficient estimates of
dental coverage in logistic regressions of the likelihood of
dental use.
Baseline estimates without controls.We first ran the model
with no controls for quality of reporting coverage. Coverage
is based on responses to the dental use questions in the sur-
vey as defined in (1) and (2) in the Methods section. Next we
ran the same model only dropping the 1352 persons we clas-
sified as having potential measurement error in reporting
coverage. Not unexpectedly, the logistic coefficient and the
point estimate of the adjusted odds ratio for dental coverage
both increased after dropping sample observations with
potential measurement error.
With controls for quality of reporting.We next estimated the
dental use model with the full sample and including controls
for the potential measurement error in reporting coverage or
no coverage in the dental use section of the survey. We ran
the model twice. In the first case, the reference group con-
tained persons reporting coverage in the dental use section
contradicted by their responses in the insurance section. In
this model, those reporting dental coverage without error are
more likely to use dental care than those reporting coverage
with error. Those reporting no coverage without error are less
likely to use dental care than those reporting coverage with
error. Those persons reporting no dental coverage in the den-
tal use section and conflicting data in the insurance section
are no more likely to use dental care than the reference group.
4 INQUIRY
In the second case, we ran the same model and we speci-
fied only persons reporting lack of dental coverage without
evidence of measurement error as the reference group.
Notably in this model, the estimated impact of dental cover-
age on the likelihood of dental use for those reporting with-
out potential measurement error is similar in magnitude to
that of the baseline case with potential measurement error
cases removed from the regression. Both cases show over a
10% downward bias from response error (ie, a coefficient of
.83 in the error-prone models as compared with .95 or .93 in
the models that control for inconsistent responses). We also
find that persons reporting dental coverage in one section of
the survey but not the other are also more likely to use dental
care than those reporting lack of dental coverage in both
sections. This positive effect of "half-reported" dental cov-
erage on dental use from above is less than the impact of

error-less reported coverage in one case, but is statistically
equivalent for persons reporting no dental coverage in the
use section of the survey and coverage in the insurance sec-
tion. The latter result was confirmed in a separate regression
not shown in Table 4 with persons reporting no coverage in
the use section and coverage in the insurance section as the
reference group.
Discussion
In summary, our study estimated an 18% rate of inconsistent
reporting by persons reporting dental coverage in the dental
use section of the Wave 6 2002 HRS. The rate was consider-
ably higher among non-users of dental services (30%) in
response to a hypothetical question regarding coverage if
services had been used compared with users of dental ser-
vices who said that dental insurance had at least partially
covered their dental care (14%). We also found distinct char-
acteristics of persons more likely to provide potentially erro-
neous coverage status based on their retirement, wealth,
health, and marital status as well as their race/ethnicity.
These individuals are characterized as black or other non-
Hispanics; not in the labor force; aged 65 to 69; never mar-
ried, divorced, or separated; with higher numbers of
difficulties with ADLs, living in households in the Northeast
Moeller et al 9
Census region, and with relatively low levels of household
wealth. Finally, estimates of the effect of dental coverage on
the likelihood of dental use were deflated by as much as 13%
without controlling for potential response errors.
Although not reported in our study, we also analyzed
inconsistent reporting of dental coverage in Wave 10 of the
HRS covering the survey period 2008 to 2010 because dental
insurance data were collected in the insurance section the
same as was done in Wave 6.25,26 However, the hypothetical
question regarding coverage for non-users was no longer
asked in the dental use section of Wave 10. Therefore, we
were unable to estimate dental use models as in Table 4
because we only had inconsistent reports by dental users. We
did find that the inconsistent reporting rate for dental users
from Wave 10 (16%) was comparable with our finding from
Wave 6 (14%).
Our study is limited because we did not have a validation
measure of dental coverage. Instead we relied solely on self-
reports to measure response errors (ie, reliability) rather than
verified proof from policy booklets or follow-back surveys
of insurance providers (ie, the validity of the responses). As
such, our 14% to 16% inconsistent rate for self-reports of
dental coverage by 2002 HRS dental users is not strictly
comparable with the 40% invalidation rate from the afore-
mentioned 1977 NMCES study and could be even higher
with similar validation.7 Apart from the considerably lower
rate of self-reported dental coverage by the elderly in the
NMCES sample (8.8%) compared with our HRS sample
(38%), our studies also differed by the inclusion of near-
elderly persons aged 55 to 64 in our study.
We note that our measure of inconsistent reporting is not
without error. We may have misclassified cases in which a
person may have coverage for a subset of procedures but not
for the dental services provided during the survey period (ie,
reported no coverage associated with use but dental coverage
in the insurance section of the survey and therefore was iden-
tified as a false "no coverage"). We assumed that those
reporting Medicare as their dental coverage source did not
realize that their coverage does not include dental benefits,
yet some of them may in fact have been in a Medicare
Advantage plan that does cover dental services (resulting in
falsely labeling some portion of the 20% of individuals
reporting Medicare as their dental insurance source as incon-
sistent "covered" respondents). In 2002, however, only 14%
of Medicare beneficiaries were in these plans.15
The findings suggest that, as in the previous literature,2
the presence of measurement error among right-hand side
variables results in the attenuation of coefficients in regres-
sion models. While we can only speculate on which responses
are correct among those who are inconsistent, we suspect
that the question wording related to coverage associated with
dental use may inflate the assertion of coverage. The ques-
tion wording asks, "Were your dental expenses completely
covered by health insurance, mostly covered, only partially
covered, or not covered at all by insurance?" Although the
wording includes "not covered at all" as a response choice,

the presupposition in the wording may suggest to the respon-
dent an expectation of insurance coverage. It would be inter-
esting to see if wording that asks respondents simply who
covered the costs would decrease the inconsistency in the
reports of coverage.
