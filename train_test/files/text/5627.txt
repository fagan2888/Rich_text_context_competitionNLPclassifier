Introduction
Globalization has necessitated the need for sustainable com-
petitive advantage (Sadia, 2011), which requires frequent
innovations in product and system management. Human
resources are the valuable assets (Pareek & Rao, 2007),
which are inimitable and can generate sustainable competi-
tive advantage through innovative ideas (Barney, 1991;
Lippman & Rumelt, 1982; Polyani, 1962; Teece, 1982;
Ward, Grudnoff, Brooker, & Simpson, 2013; Wernerfelt,
1984). To keep them motivated for new innovations, one
requires people, who can manage/lead these human resources
efficiently (Certo & Certo, 2006; Liaw, Chi, & Chuang,
2010; Shanker, 2012). Leaders play a great role in this con-
text (Chou, Lin, Chang, & Chuang, 2013). Their leadership
ability helps in attaining and retaining the quality workforce
(Kwan, 2009; Sharma & Jyoti, 2006). Although literature
reveals several styles of leadership, transformational leader-
ship (TL) is one of the most used styles in organizations to
manage the change (Kejriwal & Krishnan, 2004; Sarros &
Santora, 2001). It helps to bring valuable and positive
changes among the followers by exhibiting the role model
characteristics, providing intellectual motivation, and show-
ing individual concern for the followers (Shibru & Darshan,
2011; Stewart, 2006). In this style, the leader uses less
authority and acts as a guide, mentor, and coach to enhance
the vision of the followers. It establishes quality relation-
ships between the two on the lines of social exchange theory
(Carter, Jones-Farmer, Armenakis, Field, & Svyantek, 2009;
Liden & Maslyn, 1998). As per exchange theory, when a per-
son provides something of value to another person, it
becomes obligatory for the recipient to reciprocate (Blau,
1964), which yields beneficial consequences for the follow-
ers such as trust (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Moorman, & Fetter,
1990), career advancement (Dubinsky, Yammarino, &
Jolson, 1995), self efficacy (Walumbwa & Hartnell, 2011),
identification (Humphrey, 2012; Juan, Malero, Topa, &
Nangin, 2011), job satisfaction (Mohammad, Zeaud, &
Batayneh, 2011), and job performance (JP) (Geyer & Steyrer,
1998; Koh, Steers, & Terborg, 1995).At organizational level,
it results in organizational commitment (Avolio, Zhu, Koh,
& Bhatia, 2004; Ramachandran & Krishnan, 2009), organi-
zational citizenship behavior (Humphrey, 2012; Lian & Tui,

Impact of Transformational
Leadership on Job Performance:
Mediating Role of Leader­Member
Exchange and Relational Identification
Jeevan Jyoti1 and Sonia Bhau1
Abstract
The present study focuses on the role of leader­member exchange and relational identification (RI) between transformational
leadership and job performance relationship. The model has been tested in higher education sector. All the permanent
teachers working in higher education sector were contacted. The data have been duly validated with the help of confirmatory
factor analysis (CFA). Reliability has been assessed through Cronbach's alpha and composite reliability. Structural equation
modeling (SEM) has been used for hypotheses testing, and hierarchical regression has been used to test the moderating effect
of RI. The results indicated that leader­member exchange acts as a mediator and RI acts as a moderator instead of mediator.
The managerial implications and future scope have been discussed.

2012), and identification (Cavazotte, 2013; Humphrey, 2012;
Walumbwa & Hartnell, 2011). Many researchers like Bushra,
Usman, and Naveed (2011), Dvir, Eden, Avolio, and Shamir
(2002); Geyer and Steyrer (1998); Grant (2012); Wang, Law,
Hackett, Wang, and Chen (2005); and Yang, Melien, Chieh,
and Yushin (2011) have identified direct impact of TL on JP.
But there are other researchers, who viewed that TL affects
JP through other variables like trust (Gillespie & Mann,
2000), self efficacy (Cavazotte, 2013; Walumbwa & Hartnell,
2011), collective efficacy (Walumbwa, Wang, Lawler, & Shi,
2004), organizational citizenship behavior (Boerner,
Eisenbeiss, & Griesser, 2007), leader­member exchange
(LMX; Carter et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005), and identifica-
tion (Cavazotte, 2013; Walumbwa & Hartnell, 2011). The
second notion is better as leaders create trust and confidence
among the followers, which makes them perform better. The
present research also focuses on establishing indirect effect
of TL on JP of employees through LMX and RI. The present
study, therefore, proposes a research framework with the aim
at investigating the mediating role of LMX and RI between
TL and JP.
Conceptual Framework and
Hypotheses Development
The theoretical framework (Figure 1) has been developed on
the basis related review of literature. Burns (1978) conceptual-
ized TL, which was further extended by Bass (1985), and Bass
and Avolio (1994). They proposed full-range theory of leader-
ship, which consists of transformational, transactional, and
laissez-faire. Transformational leaders encourage followers to
exert and explore existing as well as new horizons. They are
proactive and help followers to attain unexpected goals
(Antonakis, Avolio, & Sivasubramaniam, 2003). They move
followers beyond immediate self-interest (Bass, 1999). This
type of leadership is an important antecedent to construct the
collective confidence or strength required by groups to be suc-
cessful when facing with difficult challenges (Bass & Avolio,
2003). TL can create significant organizational change and act
as change agents, foster higher level of intrinsic motivation
and loyalty among followers, and introduce a new image or
view of the future and create a commitment to this image
among followers (Kinicki & Kreitner, 2008).
The LMX theory focuses on the relationship or interac-
tion between both leaders and followers. "The interaction/
exchanges, both in content and process are defined as the
individual dyadic linkage" (Jensen, Olberding, & Rodgers,
1997, p. 321). Each relationship formed has its own unique
characteristics. Leaders not only have individual relation-
ships with each of their followers, but the relationship is
unique and viewed as a series of vertical dyads (Stringer,
2006). Furthermore, "the heart of each dyadic relationship is
the concept of a role-making process, or role negotiation pro-
cess" (Carter et al., 2009, p. 2). The role expectations of a
leader and the extent to which the subordinates meet those
expectations make up the relational context of the exchange
process (Dienesch & Liden, 1986; Jackson & Johnson, 2012;
Tse & Lam, 2008). LMX depends upon the level of trust,
interaction, support, and rewards, which determines the qual-
ity of the relationship.
Relational identification is one of three components of
the identification theory (self identity, collective identity,
and relational identity). "It is the degree to which one
includes the role relationship in one's self-concept" (Aron &
Aron, 2000, p. 110). "It refers to a partial definition of one-
self in terms of a given role relationship and offers a new
way to understand the unique supervisor-subordinate rela-
tionship" (Sluss & Ashforth, 2007, p. 11). Furthermore, it is
generally argued to be a psychological healthy relational
state, fostering empathy, liking, cooperation, and in-role and
extra-role performance. However, extreme RI can foster
negative outcomes such as co-dependency and collusion in
co-operative behavior.
Performance is the function of knowledge, skills, abilities,
and motivation directed at role-prescribed behavior, such as a
formal job responsibilities. Job performance reflects the com-
pletionoftherole/taskallocatedtoaparticularperson/employee.
Research has indicated that JP is a multi-dimensional construct
consisting of task and contextual performance (Motowidlo &
Van Scotter, 1994).
TL, LMX, and Job Performance
Transformational leaders' behavior is linked to a variety of
affective, cognitive, and behavioral outcomes. They help their
followers to become future leaders by acting as change agents
(Burns, 1978). Wang et al. (2005) reviewed several studies on
LMX and found that those studies have focused on social
exchange quality in dyad. This phenomenon helps to estab-
lish qualitative leader­follower relationship known as LMX
(Gerstner & Day, 1997). Furthermore, LMX is interpersonal

exchange of relationships between the leader and each fol-
lower. According to LMX theory, leader­follower relation-
ship may be of a high or low quality (Graen & Uhl-Bien,
1995). In high-quality LMX, the leader and member will
exchange mutual trust, support, loyalty professional respect,
work contribution, and understanding. Therefore, followers
gain numerous benefits, including effective communication,
access to the leader support, trust, approval, consideration,
autonomy, and favorable job assignments (Graen & Uhl-
Bien, 1995). According to social exchange theory, followers
are more likely to exchange these benefits with their leaders
and organizations (Liden, Sparrowe, & Wayne, 1997) in the
form of efficient JP. Empirical studies have revealed that high
quality of LMX enhances organizational commitment
(Ansari, Lee, & Aafaqi, 2007), job satisfaction (Fisk &
Friesen, 2012), organizational citizenship behavior (Asgari,
Silong, Ahmad, & Abu-Sama, 2008), creative behavior (Basu
& Green, 1997), and employee performance (Erdogan &
Enders, 2007). Furthermore, TL is a process whereby ordi-
nary people can bring forth the best in themselves and others
too. Transformational leader is able to motivate and satisfy
their followers (Givens, 2008) with their helpful, friendly
nature. They act as change agents by using friendly approach
frequently (Krishnan, 2004). Transformational leaders estab-
lish high-quality relationship with their followers by citing
appropriate examples and giving individualized attention,
which encourages followers to work in better way to achieve
organizational goals (Graen, 1976). Effective leaders express
their transformational behaviors within a personal dynamic
relational exchange context. Transformational leaders, who
are insensitive to the importance of follower's reciprocity
expectations and the relational requirements of a high-quality
relationship (e.g., reciprocity, personal development, and
social bonding), are likely to be less effective. It is through
development of stronger dyadic social bonds (Wang, Law, &
Chen, 2008) that transformational leaders make the followers
to perform better (Wang et al., 2005). Based on the arguments
and evidences above, this study, therefore, proposes that
LMX mediates the TL­JP relationship.
Hypothesis 1a: TL leads to positive LMX.
Hypothesis 1b: LMX positively affects JP.
Hypothesis 1c: LMX mediates the relationship between
TL and JP.
TL, Relational Identification With
Leader, and Job Performance
TL is a process whereby ordinary people can bring forth the
best in themselves and others too. TL exhibits four types of
behaviors, that is, behavioral charisma, inspirational motiva-
tion, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consider-
ation. Charisma arouses strong follower emotions and leader
identification by the follower (Dvir et al., 2002). It has been
found that the TL enhances followers' development.
Relational identification occurs when people adopt attitudes
and behaviors to be associated with a satisfying, self-defining
relationship with another person or group. Transformational
leaders develop RI with their followers through their behav-
ioral and idealized charisma, which makes followers to iden-
tify with their leader. The personalized relationship between
transformational leader and followers' create an environment
in which the followers' feel happy to work with their leader.
The transformational leaders act as an ideal or role model for
the follower with whom the follower likes to be identified
(Dasborough & Ashkanasy, 2002). The characteristics of
transformational leaders make them adorable and their fol-
lowers like to be identified with them. According to Sluss and
Ashforth (2007),
Relational identification is a result of interpersonal affairs,
which focuses on one's role relatedness, whereby a follower
defines him or herself in terms of a given role relationship.
Relational identification (RI) expands the follower's sense about
himself/herself; provide psychological and relational benefits.
(p. 12)
People with strong relational identities are motivated to fulfill
their partner's/leader's role expectations (Broderick, 2006),
which enhances their JP. Furthermore, those followers' who
have better understanding of their role relationships will give
high-level performance. Hence, better the role relationships
better will be the JP (Wang et al., 2008). TL will help subor-
dinate to develop RI with supervisor/leader, because such
leaders serve as exemplary role models, articulate a compel-
ling vision and communicate high-performance expectations
(Charisma), and provide emotional appeal, meaning, and
challenge to their followers (inspirational motivation). They
pay specialized attention to their followers' needs expecta-
tions and development (individualized consideration) and
guide them to look at issues from different perspectives (intel-
lectual stimulation) too. Moreover, theory and research also
suggest that transformational leaders motivate followers to
identify with the importance of their work and stress the
importance and values associated with desired outcomes in
ways that are more easily understood by the followers, while
simultaneously setting high-performance standards (Bass,
1985). Hence, identification resulting from associating with
such leaders is likely to have a positive effect on follower's
performance (Dumdum, Lowe, & Avolio, 2002; Lowe &
Sivasubramaniam, 1996). Thus, it is believed that a transfor-
mational leader may play an important role in enhancing fol-
lowers RI with the leader because the influence of such
leaders are based on their success in connecting their follow-
er's level of self-concept or identity with role relationship
(Kark & Shamir, 2002). Further effective leaders express
their transformational behaviors within a personal dynamic
relational exchange context. By developing stronger social
bonds, transformational leaders affect followers'performance
4 SAGE Open
(Wang et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2005). TL increases the emo-
tional connection or identification between the supervisor and
the follower in such a way that follower feels more confident
to perform beyond expectations. Thus, RI resulting from
associating with such leaders is likely to have a positive effect
on follower's performance.
Hypothesis 2a: TL is a significant predictor of RI.
Hypothesis 2b: Higher the RI better is the JP.
Hypothesis 2c: Relational identification mediates the
relationship between TL and JP.
Data Collection
The population comprised the teachers working in Higher
education sector (Government Degree Colleges) in Jammu
district (J&K, India). Contractual teachers were not con-
tacted because their tenure is not enough to generate associa-
tion with leader. So, permanent teachers with work experience
of more than 1 year were contacted for data generation as
Rhodes, Spencer, Keller, Liang, and Noan (2006) viewed
that work experience/longevity of relationship helps the fol-
lowers to better understand their leader and establish mutual
relationships. Furthermore, only those departments in the
colleges were contacted/covered, which consisted of at least
two teachers (one head of department [HOD] and one fellow
teacher). Ten degree colleges were contacted, which were
found relevant for the study. Eleventh college was excluded
as there were no permanent teachers. All the identified teach-
ers (392, that is, 60 HODs and 332 teachers) were contacted.
The teachers, who did not respond in the first attempt, were
consecutively contacted for second and third time too.
Finally out of 392 teachers, 266 (60 HODs and 206 teachers)
responded back, yielding a response rate of 67.85%.
Questionnaire technique was used for data collection. Two
sets of questionnaires were used to collect the data. The
information regarding TL, LMX, and RI was procured from
the teachers, and HODs provided information regarding the
JP of the teachers as well as LMX. The difference in percep-
tion regarding LMX of the HODs and teachers was checked
with the help of independent t test, and the results revealed
insignificant difference (t = 1.40, p > .05).
Performance of more than one teacher was procured from
HOD, which can cause the problem of dependence of data
(Hofmann, 1997). So to check whether the JP rating by the
HODs is independent or not, ANOVA has been applied and
results revealed insignificant difference (F = 2.26, p > .05). It
reveals that the data do not have dependence problem.
Measures
A 7-point Likert-type scale has been used for the sake of
uniformity in measuring the variables. The scales ranged
from very strongly disagree (1) to very strongly agree (7).
The items were also improvised as per requirement of the
sector. The instruments used to measure research vari-
ables are described below.
TL
Twenty-five-item scale adapted from Bass and Avolio
(1989), cited in Hartog, Muijen, and Koopman (1997), has
been used to measure the four aspects of TL, that is, ideal-
ized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimu-
lation, and individualized consideration. The idealized
influence was measured through 11 items, inspirational
motivation and intellectual stimulation through 5 items
each, and individualized consideration through 4 items. The
sample item from idealized influence was "I feel proud to be
associated with my HOD." A sample item from inspirational
motivation was "She or he is a symbol of success and
accomplishment." A sample item from intellectual stimula-
tion was "Suggests new ways of looking at how to complete
tasks assigned." A sample item from individualized consid-
eration was "Appreciates for good job." Cronbach's alpha
coefficient was .90, which exceeds the recommended level
of .70 (Nunnally, 1972).
LMX
It has been measured through 16 items and adapted from
Liden and Maslyn (1998). The four dimensions of LMX,
namely, affect, loyalty, contribution, and professional
respect, have 4 items each. A sample item from affect was "It
is fun to work with my HOD." A sample item for loyalty was
"Come to my defense if I were attacked by others." A sample
item from contribution was "I do not mind working my hard-
est for my HOD." A sample item from professional respect
was "I admire his or her professional skills." Cronbach's
alpha coefficient was .85.
Relational Identification
Ten-items scale by Walumbwa and Hartnell (2011) has been
used to measure RI. A sample item from RI was "When
someone criticizes my HOD, it feels like an insult to me."
The value of Cronbach's alpha was .80.
Job Performance
It has been measured through task and contextual perfor-
mance. Fourteen items for task performance have been gen-
erated from Goodman and Svyantek (1999) and Farh and
Cheng (1997). A sample item from task performance was
"She or he concentrates and tries her or his best on every
assignment." Motowidlo and Van Scotter's (1994) 5-items
scale was used to measure contextual performance. A sample
item from contextual performance was "She or he volunteers
to carry out tasks/activities that are not formally part of the
job." Cronbach's alpha coefficient was .89.

Results
Demographic Profile
The descriptive statistics indicated that out of 206, about
63% are females. Majority of respondents (51%) are in the
age group of 41 to 50 years. Most of teachers (29.50%) have
experience of 11 to 15 years. About 48% teachers are doctor-
ate of philosophy, 50% are assistant professors followed by
associate professors (27%), senior lecturers (16.80%), and
lecturers (5.90%). In total, 148 (80%) teachers have an asso-
ciation with HOD as colleague for a period up to 5 years.
Whereas, majority of the teachers (63.24%) are associated
with HOD as subordinate for a period up to 4 years and 68
(36.75%) had a period of association for more than 3 years
(Table 1).
Reliability and Validity Analysis
Measurement models have been designed to access the con-
vergent validity. Second order factor models were prepared
for multi-dimensional constructs (TL, LMX, and JP), and
first order factor model has been designed for RI construct
(Table 2). Items with loading less than 0.50 have been deleted
(Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2009). Convergent validity
has been established through standardized estimates (stan-
dard regression weight [SRW] > 0.5) and average variance
extracted (AVE > 0.05; Table 4). To check discriminant
validity, four-factor and one-factor models have been
designed, and the results revealed that the goodness of fit of
four-factor model (2/df = 2.37, root mean square residual
[RMR] = 0.04, goodness-of-fit index [GFI] = 0.91, adjusted
goodness-of-fit index [AGFI] = 0.90, confirmatory fit index
[CFI] = 0.93, root mean square error of approximation
[RMSEA] = 0.08) is better than one-factor model (2/df =
3.18, RMR = 0.58, GFI = 0.85, AGFI = 0.84, CFI = 0.88,
RMSEA= 0.10; Hinkin, 1995) thereby establishing discrimi-
nant validity. Further discriminant validity has also been
established by comparing AVE with squared correlation. The
AVE for all constructs is greater than squared correlation
thereby establishing discriminant validity (Fornell & Larcker,
1981; Table 3).
To check the internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha has
been used as it is the indicator of the reliability of the con-
struct (Cronbach, 1951). In the present study, alpha values

Impact of TL on Job Performance: Mediating Role
of LMX
Structural equation modeling (SEM) has been used to check
various relations proposed, it is a multivariate technique that
seeks to explain the relationship among multiple variables
(Kaplan, 2000). In the present study, the relationship between
TL, LMX, and JP have been assessed. To test the mediating
effect, all the conditions described by Baron and Kenny
(1986) were first satisfied. These are as follows: (a) the rela-
tionship between independent variable (TL) and dependent
variable (JP) should be significant (SRW = 0.40; Figure 2),
(b) the relationship between independent (TL) and mediator
(LMX) should be significant (SRW = 0.94; Figure 3), (c) the
relationship between the mediator (LMX) and outcome (JP)
should also be significant (SRW = 0.35; Figure 4), and (d)
when the mediator (LMX) is entered into the equation, that
is, relationship between independent (TL) and dependent
variable (JP) becomes insignificant (SRW = 0.03). All the
conditions of mediation as stated were fulfilled. This indi-
cates that LMX act as a mediator between TL and JP.
Furthermore, to check the significance of indirect effect,
Sobel (1982) test was applied through Sobel software. The
value of Sobel statistic was significant (Sobel statistics =
4.03, p < .001), thus providing support that LMX mediates
the relationship between TL and JP (Figure 5). Furthermore,
control variables were also included in the model, which
yielded no change in the previous relationships, so they were
not shown in the diagram. The model fitness of full media-
tion model is better as compared with no mediation and par-
tial mediation model (Table 5). Further application of
chi-square delta test revealed significant difference between
partial and full mediation model (2 = 8.15, p < .01).
Impact of TL and Job Performance: Mediating
Role of Relational Identification
To test the mediating effect, all the conditions described by
Baron and Kenny (1986) were first satisfied. We used four-step
procedure through SEM in which we first assessed the impact of
predictor, that is, TL on dependent variable, that is, JP, which is
significant (SRW = 0.40, p < .001). Hence, first condition of
mediation is accepted as TLis positively affecting JP(Figure 2).
In the second step, we studied the impact of TL on RI
which is also significant (SRW = 0.71, p < .001; Figure 6).
Next, the impact of mediator (RI) on dependent variable
(JP) has been assessed, which is significant (SRW = 0.30,
p < .001; Figure 7).
To test the mediating effect, in the last step, we added the
mediating variable, that is, RI between TL and JP. It was
found that with the introduction of RI as mediator in TL­JP
equation, the relationship between TL and JP significantly
increased (SRW = 0.45, p < .001)) instead of becoming insig-
nificant, thereby yielding no support for mediation (Figure 8).
Furthermore, the Sobel Test also revealed insignificant indi-
rect effect (Sobel Statistics 1.02, p > .05), so the ultimate con-
dition for mediation is not fulfilled. Hence, the RI does not
mediate the TL and JP relationship.
An increase in the direct relation between TL and JP, after
the introduction of RI, gave the clue relating to moderating
role of RI. So, the moderation effect has been checked

through hierarchical regression. It is a technique which is
used to understand a relationship between an outcome vari-
able (also called dependent variable) and the predictor vari-
able (also called independent variable; Uekawa, 2010). To
check moderation, hierarchical regression analysis has been
used to explore the relationship between the variables. In the
first model, two control variables, namely, association with
HOD and association with HOD as a colleague, were entered
in the regression analysis, which revealed insignificant
impact of both the variables (Table 6). In the second model,
TL was added as independent variable, which gave signifi-
cant result. The R2 and f change-statistics were better than the
first model. In the third model, along with TL and control
variable, RI was also added as independent variable; the
result revealed insignificant impact of RI on JP ( = .06,
p > .05) fulfilling another condition of moderation. Finally in
the last model, the interaction effect of TL and RI was added,
which yielded significant result ( = .30, p < .001). This sat-
isfied the last conditions of moderation. Furthermore, the
value of R2 increased from .08 to .25. The results derived
from final step provided full support for the moderation
(Table 6).
Furthermore, the effect size of the interaction has also
been calculated by using the formula given by Chin,

The R2 of the interaction model is .25 and R2 of the main
effect is .09. Thus, the interaction effect size is .10. This
effect, as per Chin et al. (1996), is considered to be between
small to medium effect size.
Furthermore, the inspection of simple slope revealed that
high-RI strengthens the relationship and vice versa (Figure 9).
Hence, all the hypotheses proposed in study are accepted,
except one, that is, Hypothesis 2c (Table 7).
Discussion
The focus of the study is to identify the role of LMX and RI
between TL and JP equation. Furthermore, direct relation-
ships between TL, LMX, RI, and JP were also assessed
which were found significant. First, the results of the study
indicated that TL significantly affects LMX, which is consis-
tent with the previous studies (Dvir et al., 2002; Givens,
2008). Transformational leaders establish high-quality rela-
tionships with their followers by providing them friendly and
fair treatment. LMX affects the JP of subordinates (Jensen
et al., 1997). Because of qualitative exchange of relation-
ships (LMX), the JP of followers is enhanced. It is found that
those teachers, who are loyal and ethical (part of LMX) in
nature, perform better. They contribute more in terms of
achieving the goals of the department and the organization.
Furthermore, LMX mediates the TL and JP relationship.
Various characteristics of transformational leaders, namely,
idealized influence, intellectual stimulation, inspirational
motivation, and individualized consideration, help in creat-
ing better relationships with the followers, which motivate
the employees for better performance (Dubinsky et al.,
1995). The idealized influence increases the professional
respect for the leader. The followers accept them as their role
models and achieve higher goals by exhibiting superior per-
formance. The motivational behavior of leaders also inspires
the followers to achieve the organizational goals (Stewart,
2006). Moreover, transformational leaders show individual
concern for each of their followers to solve their work- and
life-related problems, which helps in developing positive
relations, and the followers readily do the work as desired by
leader (Bodla & Nawaz, 2010). Under the supervision of
such leaders, the subordinates feel happy and are motivated
to work hard. The results of mediation are in line with previ-
ous researches (Carter et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005). It is
also found that TL is a significant predictor of RI. The results
are consistent with previous studies (Dasborough &
Ashkanasy, 2002). The working style of transformational
leaders (mentoring, guiding, coaching, emotional support,
and developing followers to be future leaders) creates a con-
genial work environment for the followers, and they like to
be identified with such leaders. The leader becomes role
model for the follower, who is likely to be influenced more
by such leader (Sluss & Ashforth, 2007). The leaders, who
follow the rules and regulations of the organization, become
respectable in eyes of subordinates, and hence, subordinates

feel proud in being associated with such kind of leader.
Furthermore, while checking mediation model of RI, the
relationship between RI and JP became insignificant, which
was prior significant when relationships were checked indi-
vidually proving that RI does not mediate the TL and JP rela-
tionship. Instead of mediator, RI act as a moderator (Table 6).
It is inferred that in the presence of TL, RI does not influence
JP directly, but its interaction with TL significantly affects JP.
The RI strengthens the relationship of TL and JP. It helps
leaders to establish role clarity and empathy (part of RI)
among the followers, which instill confidence and trust in
them and they work whole heartedly to meet leaders'
expectations.
Conclusion
This study is an insight into getting a more appropriate model
relating to TL in the higher education sector. The role of
LMX and RI in between TL and JP has been determined. It
has been found that LMX acts as a mediator. It makes the
subordinates work more efficiently as it creates better under-
standing among the followers and the leaders. Furthermore,
it leads to clear role relationships between the leader and fol-
lowers, which ultimately helps both to have a good working
relationship. In presence of LMX, leaders would be able to
influence the ability of the follower to work efficiently for
organization, which ultimately enhances his or her JP.
Furthermore, the RI does not act as a mediator between the
TL and JP relationship, but it act as a moderator and
strengthen the relationship between TL and JP. So the lead-
ers/managers should give due consideration to develop posi-
tive LMX with their subordinates and act as role model to
develop role identification to make them better performer.
General Implications
Managers need to pay close attention to the opinions and
moods engendered within their relationships with subordi-
nates. Managers should focus on creating an environment in
which personal work goals of the subordinates are linked
with organizational goals with the help of role-person inte-
gration. Managers should make their decisions more trans-
parent by exhibiting consistency in their logic and reasoning.
Remaining impartial in decision making will help managers
to instill trust and respect in the minds of subordinates.
Managers should create more enthusiasm and optimism
among the employees. The belief in employees that "they
can do it" helps them realize their potential with more confi-
dence and inspires them to try harder. Besides maintaining
good relationships with subordinates, managers should rec-
ognize their contributions either through verbal or written
mode, for example, recognition by top management should
be given to efficient employees by giving them awards and
certificates. Managers should make employees to think out
of box to generate new ideas for enhancing JP.
Practical Implications
To make working of teachers effective, the HODs can use
following implications. HOD should provide coaching and

mentoring to move them on the ladder of development,
which will show an increased level of commitment, motiva-
tion, satisfaction, and performance among them such as he or
she should follow the timetable framed, remain punctual,
complete his or her own tasks in time, and take his or her
own lecture in time. The HOD must agree with the opinion
of the subordinates when they come with sound logic and
reasoning, so they can feel confident and transform into
future leaders. Participative decision making should be
encouraged and the leader should create open atmosphere in
the staffroom and meetings so that everybody gets involved
in discussions, and a healthy atmosphere leads to increased
morale of fellow teachers to work hard for attaining the
department goals. HOD should work toward creating good-
quality relationships with fellow teachers, which will make
them feel better, accomplish more, and help their organiza-
tion to prosper. Both the HOD and the fellow teachers are
required to work in cooperation, which can be possible when
both have clarity regarding their roles. Clarity of role rela-
tionships will reduce conflicts. The HOD should make
proper proposals for the arrangement of workshops for the
enhancement of skills, seminars, where subordinates can
learn about their career-related growth and development per-
spectives. The leader should assess about the performance
and attitude of followers by having continuous interactions
with them after completion of tasks assigned. Through this
he would be able to get an idea about the behavior and work-
ing ability of the subordinate.
Limitation and Future Research
This study represents a cross sectional investigation as
responses were gathered from respondents at a particular
point of time. Moreover, the study is confined to government
degree colleges operating in Jammu district only. Due to pri-
vacy involved, respondents might have been reluctant to
share correct information due to their defensive attitude. The
element of subjectivity might have not been checked com-
pletely as teachers have responded on the basis of their own
experience and perceptions regarding the statements in the
questionnaire. In future, longitudinal study can be conducted.
Comparative study between private and public colleges can
be undertaken in future. Furthermore, leadership effective-
ness with non-teaching staff can also be measured. More out-
comes can be taken into account, for example, cultural
differences, other leadership styles, and so on for better
understanding of the concept.
