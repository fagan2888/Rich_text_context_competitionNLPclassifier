Abstract Adolescence is a time during which positive
adults outside the familial context may be most influential
to development. A growing body of research on naturally
occurring mentors has found favorable outcomes for
youth who have these types of positive adult figures in
their lives. Less is known, however, about how these
naturally occurring mentors influence youths'
development in the long-term. This study examines the
long-term outcomes related to having a naturally
occurring community mentor in adolescence. Results from
longitudinal analyses of a nationally representative sample
of adolescents revealed that having a mentor in
adolescence was related to higher educational attainment,
lower criminal activity, higher psychological well-being
(i.e., optimism, self-efficacy, and lack of depressive
symptoms), and greater romantic relationship satisfaction
in adulthood. Additionally, a taxonomy of mentoring
functions was created from qualitative responses and
drawing upon the youth, work, and academic mentoring
literature. This taxonomy aims to serve as a framework
for understanding the functions of youth mentors to
provide a foundation for future research. Implications of
findings and future directions are considered.

Introduction
Mentors play a valuable role in the lives of adolescents.
Children and adolescents with supportive and caring non-
parental adults in their lives have been shown to be more
successful in a variety of ways (DuBois, Holloway,
Valentine & Cooper, 2002). Young people with mentors
do better in school (Rhodes, Grossman & Resch, 2000),
are more socially successful (Langhout, Rhodes &
Osborne, 2004), and engage in less problem behaviors
(Chang, Greenberger, Chen, Heckhausen & Farruggia,
2010; DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005b) than unmentored
adolescents. These findings cross cultural, gender, and
socioeconomic lines (e.g., Erickson, McDonald & Elder,
2009; Haddad, Chen & Greenberger, 2011), and a large
body of research finds similar results among college
students (Nora & Crisp, 2007) and adults (Kram, 1985;
Ramaswami, Dreher, Bretz & Wiethoff, 2010).
While the majority of research on adolescent and youth
mentoring has focused on formal mentoring relationships
or mentoring programs (e.g., DuBois et al., 2002; Rhodes
et al., 2000), in the past decade there has been an emer-
gence of literature highlighting the value of naturally
occurring mentorships for young people (DuBois & Sil-
verthorn, 2005b; Sterrett, Jones, McKee & Kincaid,
2011). Naturally occurring mentors, or people who "step
outside of their normal social roles" to help and support
youth (Erickson et al., 2009, p. 344), are reported by 80%
of youth, making them more common than formal men-
tors during adolescence (McLearn, Colasanto & Schoen,
1998). Moreover, naturally occurring mentors provide the
same (DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005b) or even greater
benefits than formal mentors (Ragins & Cotton, 1999).
However, the unstructured and sometimes ambiguous
nature of naturally occurring mentor relationships makes

them more difficult to study and their impact more diffi-
cult to quantify. For instance, studies often include peers,
relatives, or parents in analyses of adolescents' naturally
occurring mentoring relationships. Thus, definitions can
vary widely and sometimes conflate mentoring with famil-
ial or peer support. Furthermore, the lack of a fully devel-
oped theoretical model of youth mentoring functions adds
to the challenge of precisely capturing the quality or goals
of a naturally occurring mentor relationship.
In this article, we define a naturally occurring mentor as
an unrelated (nonfamily member) adult who has an ongo-
ing and positive impact on the life of a prot
eg
e. We aim to
understand the long-term correlates of these relationships
using a large nationally representative U.S. sample and
linking mentoring in adolescence to functioning in multi-
ple domains during young adulthood (25­35 year olds).
While some outcomes have been assessed thoroughly and
tracked well into young adulthood (e.g., psychological
well-being), others have been scarcely investigated (e.g.,
romantic relationship satisfaction), or only assessed into
emerging adulthood (e.g., substance use has been studied
in 18- to 25-year-old participants). Our second aim is to
describe the mentoring functions provided by naturally
occurring mentors to advance theory and research on these
relationships. In the review that follows, we address the
existing empirical literature regarding these outcomes in
adolescence (12­18 years), emerging adulthood (18­
25 years), and young adulthood (25­35 years).
Benefits of Mentors: What Outcomes Does
Mentoring Predict?
Given that adolescence is a time of dramatic changes in
cognitive, social, and identity domains (cf. Choudhury,
Charman & Blakemore, 2008; Erikson, 1980), experiences
during these years can set the stage for positive adjust-
ment in adulthood (Hoyt, Chase-Lansdale, McDade &
Adam, 2012; Sampson & Laub, 2005). Indeed, the youth
mentoring literature in recent decades has begun to
embrace a positive youth development (PYD) perspective
and increasingly emphasize the role of mentoring in
enhancing thriving. The PYD perspective argues that
research should investigate strategies to promote youth
well-being in addition to reducing problem behaviors
(Lerner, Dowling & Anderson, 2003). Several studies
extend the products of developmental relationships beyond
school retention and substance use to look at psychologi-
cal well-being as well as positive contributions to society
(Whitney, Hendricker & Offutt, 2011; Zeldin, Christens &
Powers, 2013; Zeldin, Krauss, Collura, Lucchesi & Sulai-
man, 2014). A strong test of the long-term correlates of
naturally occurring mentors in adolescence would entail
linking mentoring to competencies in young adulthood.
We selected five categories of outcomes that span multiple
domains of functioning to provide a holistic picture of the
long-term role of naturally occurring mentoring relation-
ships during adolescence, examining psychological well-
being, romantic relationships, educational attainment,
career success, and criminal activity in young adulthood.
Psychological Well-being
Recent studies of mentoring have demonstrated the role of
mentoring in promoting the psychological well-being of
adolescent prot
eg
es (Chen, Greenberger, Farruggia, Bush
& Dong, 2003; DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a). Similarly,
longitudinal research has shown the benefit of having a
natural mentor in adolescence for predicting optimism in
later adolescence (Kogan, Brody & Chen, 2011) as well
as life satisfaction and psychological well-being in young
adulthood (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014). Mentors offer
support and care, which can help adolescents develop a
more positive self-concept and in turn lead to better psy-
chological functioning (Rhodes, Spencer, Keller, Liang &
Noam, 2006). Mentors can also model emotion regulation
and provide opportunities to develop these skills. Other
mentoring functions that may promote psychological well-
being include acting as a friend or parent, providing emo-
tional support, counseling, and showing positive regard
for the adolescent (Chen et al., 2003; Greeson, Usher &
Grinstein-Weiss, 2010; Kram, 1985; Spencer, 2010).
These formative experiences around positive self-concept
may have lasting implications for adolescents' psychologi-
cal well-being that persist into adulthood (Hoyt et al.,
2012; Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014). This study replicates
this finding in a nationally representative sample.
Romantic Relationship Satisfaction
Relationship satisfaction in adulthood has been linked to a
number of developmental experiences and skills that
might be influenced by a mentor in adolescence. Mentors
provide adolescents with opportunities to learn new strate-
gies such as positive ways of responding and behaving in
social situations and emotion regulation skills (Rhodes
et al., 2006). These skills are predictive of relationship
satisfaction in adulthood (Bradbury & Scaffer, 2012; Mal-
ouff, Schutte & Thorsteinsson, 2014). Among adolescents,
mentoring has been shown to relate to greater trust in
adults (DuBois et al., 2002; Rhodes et al., 2006), as well
as improved social functioning (Langhout et al., 2004).
Further, having a mentor in adolescence is predictive of
better social functioning in young adulthood (Hurd &
Zimmerman, 2014). However, no published studies have
considered the role of mentors in relation to adolescents'
48 Am J Community Psychol (2016) 57:47­59
functioning in romantic relationships, nor have they
specifically investigated mentoring relationships as foun-
dational for developing healthy and satisfying adult
romantic relationships. Thus, this study addresses this gap
by linking mentoring to relationship satisfaction in young
adulthood.
Educational Attainment
Numerous studies demonstrate a relationship between
naturally occurring mentoring relationships in adoles-
cence and educational attainment (DuBois & Silver-
thorn, 2005a,b; Erickson et al., 2009; Tolan, Henry,
Schoeny, Lovegrove & Nichols, 2014). Having a tea-
cher or other educator as a mentor was particularly ben-
eficial for supporting educational success during these
years (Fruiht & Wray-Lake, 2013). This link is perhaps
the most commonly demonstrated benefit of adolescent
mentoring, and the impact of mentoring on educational
attainment has been demonstrated to reach beyond ado-
lescence into emerging adulthood (DuBois & Silver-
thorn, 2005a; Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht & Wray-
Lake, 2013). By exposing adolescents to new learning
experiences, explicitly encouraging academic success
(Tolan et al., 2014), fostering a positive academic iden-
tity (Erickson et al., 2009), providing the social capital
(Chang et al., 2010), and motivating goal attainment
(Spencer, 2010), mentors can promote educational suc-
cess in their prot
eg
es. This study replicates past findings
in a sample young adults, by which age most have
likely completed their education.
Career Success
Educational attainment and success in school can, in turn,
open doors to more career options. Many of the same cogni-
tive and motivational skills related to goal setting may
translate to career building skills that benefit adolescents as
they move into the workforce. Not surprisingly, mentoring
in adolescence has been shown to increase the likelihood of
being employed in emerging adulthood (DuBois & Silver-
thorn, 2005b; McDonald, Erickson, Johnson & Elder,
2007). It does not, however, seem to predict job stability or
extrinsic job rewards (such as pay and benefits) as prot
eg
es
reach their 20s and 30s (McDonald & Lambert, 2014)
except for individuals without a father figure who had a
male mentor (Timpe & Lunkenheimer, 2015). Yet, men-
tored adolescents have jobs with more autonomy and
authority in these early career years (McDonald & Lambert,
2014). Among adults in the workforce, mentoring improves
job and career satisfaction (Allen, Eby, Poteet, Lentz &
Lima, 2004)--however, no studies have considered the
relationship between mentoring in adolescence and job sat-
isfaction in adulthood. Thus, this study will address this gap
by investigating this relationship.
Criminal Activity
Formal and informal mentoring relationships have been
shown to protect against criminality (DuBois & Silver-
thorn, 2005a), aggression (Kogan et al., 2011; Tolan
et al., 2014), and substance use (Rhodes, Reddy & Gross-
man, 2005; Schwartz, Chan, Rhodes & Scales, 2013a;
Tolan et al., 2014; Whitney et al., 2011) in adolescence
and emerging adulthood. Tolan et al. (2014) suggest that
mentors protect against delinquency by role modeling
appropriate behaviors, advocating for the prot
eg
e, provid-
ing emotional support, and being a resource for practical
information. Alternatively, Kogan et al. (2011) demon-
strated that the effect of mentoring on problem behaviors
is mediated by mentees' self-regulatory skills and opti-
mism. Given the role of early substance use and criminal
activity in predicting adult problem behavior (Sampson &
Laub, 2005), and the recent study of developmental cas-
cades in understanding the role of early adolescent experi-
ences as precursors to later experiences and behaviors
(Masten & Cicchetti, 2010), it stands to reason that men-
tors who support and protect their adolescent prot
eg
es
from problem behaviors may have a downstream impact
on criminal activity in adulthood. Our study will consider
this relationship between mentoring in adolescence and
criminal activity into young adulthood.
Mentoring Functions: How Do Mentors Help
Adolescents?
Researchers who investigate natural mentoring relation-
ships increasingly underscore the importance of looking
not just at the presence of a mentor, but at the quality
and characteristics of the relationship (e.g., Hurd & Zim-
merman, 2014; Kogan et al., 2011). Indeed, relatively
little is known about how mentoring happens in informal
contexts (cf. Spencer, 2010; Sterrett et al., 2011).
Despite the growing body of research about the value of
a mentor, types of mentors (Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht
& Wray-Lake, 2013), and even relationship quality
(Beam, Chen & Greenberger, 2002), little to no empiri-
cal data examine the functions of youth mentors to ask
what they do to impact the lives of their young prot
eg
es.
To comprehensively understand the role of naturally
occurring mentors, we analyzed and categorized adoles-
cents' qualitative responses about how mentors helped
them.
Rhodes et al. (2006) provide a theoretical model of the
three key ways that youth mentors support socioemotional,
Am J Community Psychol (2016) 57:47­59 49
cognitive, and identity development of children and adoles-
cents. While this model offers a useful starting point for
understanding some of the key functions of youth mentors,
the model has rarely if ever been tested and thus lacks empiri-
cal support. Further, it does not provide much detail about
what mentoring looks like, how adolescents perceive the sup-
port they receive, or the mechanisms through which mentors
provide support for these three broad domains of develop-
ment. Building from this work and the works of others (e.g.,
DuBois, Portillo, Rhodes, Silverthorn, & Valentine, 2011),
Tolan et al. (2014) parsed the functions of youth mentors into
four categories: (a) role modeling, (b) teaching, (c) advocacy,
and (d) emotional support. While this model provides some-
what more concrete categories of support, it is again based on
theoretical estimations of the functions of youth mentors. In
their meta-analytic review of formal mentoring programs,
these four components were coded as present/nonpresent in
various programs, but no useful taxonomy for understanding
what comprises each function was provided.
Conversely, in the career mentoring literature, Kram
(1985) delineated the two key mentoring functions of a
workplace mentor (i.e., career and psychosocial) and then
provided more fine grain detail about the mechanisms of
support under each umbrella. For example, career mentor-
ing includes various functions, such as coaching, sponsor-
ing, challenging, and promoting visibility (Kram, 1985).
This more explicit model better explains the nature of
mentoring relationships and the ways that mentors promote
positive outcomes for their prot
eg
es. It allows researchers
to look at the specific types of support that benefit specific
types of prot
eg
e development and to provide a common
language for discussing mentoring functions and the out-
comes associated with them. Kram's model has stimulated
a substantial body of research on career mentoring that
investigates the outcomes associated with varied mentoring
functions (Allen et al., 2004). Such a taxonomy does not
yet exist in the youth mentoring literature, but is a critical
next step toward understanding youth mentoring relation-
ships in a more complex way. Using qualitative responses
from a national U.S. sample of youth who report naturally
occurring mentors, this study aims to advance theory and
research on youth mentoring by describing youth reported
functions of mentors and categorizing them into a taxon-
omy. This work can also advance the practice of youth
mentoring by highlighting youth's views of various types
of help they receive from mentors.
Hypotheses
In summary, this study aims to answer two key research
questions about youth mentoring: (a) What benefits of
having a mentor in adolescence stretch into young adult-
hood? (b) How do adolescents' mentors provide support
for socioemotional, cognitive, and identity development?
Building upon the well-documented benefits of mentors in
adolescence, this study tests five hypotheses about the
young adult competencies associated with having a natu-
rally occurring mentor in adolescence. To replicate past
findings (e.g., Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014; Kogan et al.,
2011), we predicted that people who reported having a
mentor during adolescence would have greater psycholog-
ical well-being in adulthood than unmentored participants.
Specifically, we hypothesized that mentored adolescents
would report greater levels of optimism (Hypothesis 1a),
greater levels of self-efficacy (Hypothesis 1b), and less
depressive symptoms (Hypothesis 1c) than people who
report having no mentor. Furthermore, we tested the the-
ory-driven hypothesis that individuals who report having
a mentor during adolescence would report greater relation-
ship satisfaction with their romantic partner in adulthood
than those who reported having no mentor (Hypothesis 2).
In line with past findings about the role of mentoring
in predicting academic success in emerging adulthood
(e.g., DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a), we hypothesized that
individuals who reported having a mentor during adoles-
cence would report greater educational attainment in
adulthood than those who reported having no mentor
(Hypothesis 3). To complement findings of McDonald
and Lambert (2014) regarding career outcomes associated
with mentoring, we hypothesized people who report hav-
ing a mentor during adolescence would report greater job
satisfaction in adulthood than those who reported having
no mentor (Hypothesis 4). Finally, given findings regard-
ing the protective role of mentors in reducing problem
behaviors in adolescence and emerging adulthood (e.g.,
DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a; Kogan et al., 2011; Tolan
et al., 2014), we hypothesized that having a mentor in
adolescence would predict less criminal behavior in young
adulthood (Hypothesis 5).
To address our second research question and encourage
the solidification of a taxonomy of youth mentoring func-
tions, we systematically analyzed qualitative responses
about the functions of adolescents' naturally occurring
mentors and aimed to categorize ways that mentors support
their adolescent prot
eg
es. We expected that youth reports
of how mentors helped them would include descriptions of
mentoring functions similar to those outlined by Kram
(1985), Chen et al. (2003), Greeson et al. (2010), Nora
and Crisp (2007), Schwartz, Rhodes, Spencer and Gross-
man (2013b), Spencer (2010), and Tolan et al. (2014).
These frameworks cross boundaries of prot
eg
e age, rela-
tionship type, and relationship goals capturing the array of
mentoring functions described in the current literature.
However, none of these frameworks provide a complete
and cohesive set of functions applied broadly to youth
50 Am J Community Psychol (2016) 57:47­59
mentoring relationships. Utilizing a national sample of
youth enhances the comprehensive and generalizable
nature of our taxonomy of youth mentoring functions.
Method
Participants
This study utilized data from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (ADD Health)--a
nationally representative study that began in 1994 with
7th­12th graders to examine the causes of health-related
behaviors of adolescence into adulthood. Data were
obtained through in-home interviews with students and
their parents, along with computer-assisted personal
interviews. This study used data that spanned approxi-
mately a 15-year period: Waves I (1994­1995), III
(2001­2002), and IV (2007­2009). Publically available
data were retrieved through The Institute for Social,
Cultural, and Policy Research (ISCPR; Harris & Udry,
1994-2008).
All mentoring variables were extracted from the publi-
cally available Wave III data consisting of 4882 partici-
pants with an age range of 18­28 years. Wave IV
(n = 5114) was used to identify measures of competencies
in young adulthood (25­35 years of age). Wave I
(n = 6504) was used to determine basic demographic
information such as age, biological sex, and ethnicity, as
well as potential personal and environmental risk factors
such as parent receiving public assistance, and feelings of
safety in the neighborhood (Table 1). These variables
were used as covariates for all analyses and were selected
based on relevant natural mentoring literature (DuBois &
Silverthorn, 2005a,b; Greeson et al., 2010).
Participants with mentors were identified by answering
the following question in the Wave III home interview,
"Other than your parents or step-parents, has an adult
made an important positive difference in your life at any
time since you were 14 years old?" Participants were
excluded if (a) they did not identify mentors (i.e., others,
refused, don't know options), (b) related family members
(i.e., brother, sister, grandparents, stepparents, aunt,
uncle), peers, spouses, or partners were reported as men-
tors, (c) there was not enough written response to be
coded for mentors' functioning question, "How did {he/
she} help you?" (i.e., blank response, incomplete/incoher-
ent response, and responses that did not provide enough
detail to be coded; n = 58), or (d) they reported that their
mentor became important outside of the adolescent years
(12­22 years of age). This age range was chosen because
it encompasses adolescence and the transition into
adulthood.
The sample consisted of 1350 (54.1%) participants
who reported having a naturally occurring mentor meeting
our criteria and 1145 participants who reported not having
a mentor (45.9%). Participants with missing data on
covariates, mentoring, or adult competency measures were
excluded from the analyses. Responses from the 1350 par-
ticipants that were identified as having a nonfamilial and
nonpeer mentor were analyzed for the taxonomy of
mentoring functions.
Chi-square analyses examined whether reporting a
mentor varied as a function of sex, ethnicity, public assis-
tance, and neighborhood safety. Youth who reported hav-
ing a mentor during adolescence were more likely to be
White, report that their parents did not receive public
assistance, and report feeling safe in their neighborhood at
Wave I. A t-test examining differences in age between
mentored and unmentored participants was significant,
suggesting that mentored individuals were somewhat
younger than unmentored individuals (Table 1).
Measures
Psychological Well-being
This study assessed three components of psychological
well-being: optimism, self-efficacy, and depression as
measured in the Wave IV interview.
Optimism. Participants' optimism was assessed by
taking the mean of their responses to three items
(a = .617): "I am always optimistic about my future,"
"Overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than
bad," and the reverse coded item "I rarely count on good

things happening to me." Responses were coded on a
five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree).
Self-efficacy. Participants' level of self-efficacy was
assessed by taking the mean of their responses to three
items (a = .756): "There is little I can do to change the
important things in my life," "I have little control over
things that happen to me," and "There is really no way I
can solve the problems I have." Responses were coded on
a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree)
to 5 (strongly agree). The composite score of the three
items was reversed to provide greater interpretability
(higher scores signified greater self-efficacy).
Depressive Symptoms. Prevalence of depressive
symptoms was assessed by taking the mean of their
responses to three items about feelings in the past 7 days
(a = .814): "You could not shake off the blues, even with
help from your family and friends," "You felt depressed,"
and "You felt sad." The responses were coded as:
0 = never or rarely, 1 = sometimes, 2 = a lot of the time,
and 3 = most of the time or all of the time.
Relationship Satisfaction
Participants' relationship satisfaction with their current (or
most recent) romantic partner was assessed by taking the
mean of the response values to seven items measuring sat-
isfaction, enjoyment, trust, and intimacy in a romantic
relationship (a = .884). Responses ranged from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).
Educational Attainment
Educational attainment was assessed continuously using
the following question on Wave IV, "What is the highest
level of education that you have achieved to date?"
Response categories ranged from 1 (did not finish high
school) to 10 (doctoral or professional degree).
Job Satisfaction
Job satisfaction was determined based on responses to a
single question that asked, "How satisfied (are/were) you
with (your current or most recent) job, as a whole?"
Responses were coded on a five-point Likert scale of "sat-
isfaction" ranging from 1 (extremely satisfied) to 5 (ex-
tremely dissatisfied). Scores were reversed so that higher
scores reflected greater satisfaction.
Criminal Activity
Participants' involvement with the law was assessed using
their responses to four questions regarding being arrested,
convicted, on probation, or serving a jail or prison
sentence for a crime. Responses were coded as 0 if they
answered "no" to all of the questions and 1 if they
answered "yes" to any of the questions. Responses were
dichotomized because of the low prevalence of criminal
activity among youth in this sample.
Covariates
Covariates used in this study were gender (0 = male,
1 = female), age (in years), ethnicity (dummy coded with
White as the reference group), parent receives public assis-
tance (0 = no, 1 = yes), and participants feeling safe in
their neighborhoods (0 = no, 1 = yes).
Mentoring Functions
Participants' responses to an open-ended mentoring func-
tion question that asked "How did {he/she} help you?"
were coded by two researchers using existing frameworks
(Chen et al., 2003; Greeson et al., 2010; Kram, 1985;
Nora & Crisp, 2007; Spencer, 2010; Tolan et al., 2014),
while remaining open to the emergence of themes not rep-
resented in existing frameworks--a procedure similar to
that used in the examination of adolescents' reports of
family values (Wray-Lake, Flanagan, Benavides & Shu-
bert, 2014). Coders examined responses three times. The
first time coders familiarized themselves with the data and
discussed descriptions of mentor functions as defined in
the literature. The second time the coders assigned codes
to responses using mentor functions outlined by the exist-
ing frameworks. Lastly, the coders considered responses
that could not be coded with existing frameworks to look
for the emergence of new themes not captured by existing
models. Each response was given a maximum of three
codes. To assess inter-rater reliability, the coders coded
12.5% (n = 169) of the responses individually and com-
pared codes. A kappa of .808 was obtained between
coders, and differences in coding were reconciled through
discussion.
Results
To answer the dual research questions about (a) the long-
term correlates of mentoring and (b) how mentors help
adolescents, analyses were conducted in two parts. First,
quantitative analyses investigated the adult competencies
associated with having a naturally occurring nonfamilial,
nonpeer mentor in adolescence. Second, to categorize
mentoring functions, researchers coded responses from an
open-ended question about the supports that mentors
provided.

Quantitative Analyses of Competencies in Young
Adulthood
Initial descriptive statistics revealed some of the young
adult measures were not normally distributed; thus, log
transformations were performed on measures of depressive
symptoms, relationship satisfaction, and self-efficacy to
meet statistical assumptions of parametric analyses. Hier-
archical linear regression was used for all analyses except
for criminal activities, for which binary logistic regression
was used. Covariates were entered in the first step for all
analyses; having a mentor was entered in the second step.
Beta weights reported throughout represent standardized
regression coefficients within each model.
Psychological Well-being
After accounting for age, ethnicity, gender, parents use of
public assistance, and feeling safe in one's neighborhood,
having a mentor during adolescence was positively related
to self-efficacy (b = .112, p < .001; R2 = .014,
p < .001) and optimism (b = .101, p < .001; R2 = .010,
p < .001) in adulthood and negatively related to depres-
sive symptoms in adulthood (b = À.068, p < .01;
R2 = .004, p = .002; Table 2).
Relationship Satisfaction
Additionally, having a mentor during adolescence was
related to greater romantic relationship satisfaction in

Educational Attainment
Having a mentor during adolescence was related to higher
educational attainment in adulthood (b = .267, p < .001,
R2 = .069, p < .001) after accounting for controls.
Job Satisfaction
Having a mentor during adolescence was not significantly
related to job satisfaction in adulthood (b = .016, p > .05)

Criminal Activity
Binary logistic regression results revealed that individuals
who reported having a mentor during adolescence were
less likely to have been involved in criminal activity
(OR = 0.81 [95% CI = 0.65­1.00], p < .05) after control-
ling for age, ethnicity, gender, parents use of public
assistance, and feeling safe in one's neighborhood.
Qualitative Analysis of Mentoring Functions
Two researchers coded 1350 open-ended responses about
how mentors helped their adolescent prot
eg
es. The coding
scheme developed generated 19 distinct mentoring func-
tions (Table 3). From these, 14 reflected mentoring func-
tions that have been described in the literature, capturing
77.06% of responses, and five emerged from analysis of
responses that could not be coded using existing func-
tions. Each response could be given up to three codes:
870 (64.44%) of the responses were given one code, 383
(28.44%) of the responses received two codes, and 97
(7.19%) of the responses received three codes. Socioemo-
tional support, a function included in every preexisting
framework of mentoring, was the largest category, making
up 19.31% of codes. Other major categories included pro-
viding professional/academic guidance (12.93%), provid-
ing life advice/personal guidance (11.58%), instilling
positive personal attributes (10.12%), and promoting moti-
vation for goals (9.82%).
Codes were then organized into three meta-functions
--socioemotional development, cognitive development,
and identity development--that map on to Rhodes

et al.'s (2006) framework. Socioemotional development
comprises functions like providing emotional support or
being a friend. Cognitive development includes interac-
tions such as teaching practical skills and providing
educational and professional guidance and sponsorship.
Finally, identity development is made up of functions
that would help the adolescent develop a sense of self
such as instilling positive personal attributes, being a
role model, and supporting goal striving. A summary of
meta-functions is provided in Table 4. Meta-functions
did not capture "general/underspecified" category nor
"tangible support." Tangible supports such as financial
support and providing childcare or resources did not fit
well into any of Rhodes et al.'s (2006) functions, but
should be noted as functions of youth's natural
mentors.
Discussion
The two primary goals of this study were to understand
the longitudinal correlates of naturally occurring mentor-
ing relationships in adolescence and to identify and clas-
sify the mentoring functions provided by these mentors.
Having a naturally occurring mentor in adolescence was
associated with better psychological well-being, greater
overall satisfaction with a romantic partner, greater educa-
tion attainment, and less criminal activity in young adult-
hood. Extending findings into young adulthood is
important because it is a time when individuals enter into
more stable and mature relationships and careers. Further,
by coding the mentoring functions reported by a nation-
ally representative sample of adolescents, we were able to
expand Rhodes et al. (2006) model of youth mentoring
functions to identify specific types of strategies mentors
use to supporting socioemotional, cognitive, and identity
development. The quantitative and qualitative findings
together tell a story about the long-term role of mentoring
relationships for young adults' competencies and about
how mentoring might work to enhance positive outcomes.
Although merging the quantitative and qualitative findings
empirically were beyond the scope of this article, we syn-
thesize these findings in our discussion of the value of
our work for theory and practice.
Longitudinal results demonstrate the long-term influ-
ence of mentoring relationships in adolescence on
young adulthood regarding academic, social, and emo-
tional competencies. The findings build upon past
research that demonstrate the correlations between ado-
lescent mentoring and thriving in emerging and young
adulthood and expand the competencies associated with
mentoring beyond the traditional focus on academics
and problem behaviors to see the association between
mentoring and positive adult relationships. A key contri-
bution of this study is investigating a comprehensive set
of outcomes associated with adolescent mentoring in
young adulthood. While past research has shown many
correlates of adolescent mentoring relationships with
emerging adult outcomes, this study demonstrates that
these benefits of mentoring persist into young adulthood
as individuals enter into more stable careers and
relationships.

Socioemotional Development
Youth with natural mentors in adolescence reported
greater optimism and self-efficacy and fewer depressive
symptoms in young adulthood. These results are congru-
ent with previous studies suggesting that mentoring is
beneficial for well-being in adolescence and young adult-
hood (DuBois & Silverthorn, 2005a; Hurd & Zimmerman,
2014; Khan, 2012; Kogan et al., 2011). Extending past
studies of the social benefits of mentoring in young adult-
hood (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014), results demonstrated
that mentored adolescents were more satisfied in their
romantic relationships in their 20s and 30s compared with
unmentored adolescents. Despite the small effect size, this
novel finding suggests a potentially long-lasting and far-
reaching effect of naturally occurring mentoring relation-
ships, as no past studies have considered romantic rela-
tionship satisfaction as related to youth mentoring. Given
role of mentoring relationships in developing social skills,
emotional regulation, and the ability to build other posi-
tive relationships (Hurd & Zimmerman, 2014; Langhout
et al., 2004), this finding expands our overall understand-
ing of the broad-reaching effects of naturally occurring
relationships on psychosocial competencies.
Qualitative findings suggest that mentors provide a
variety of socioemotional mentoring functions to their
prot
eg
es that may develop a foundation for well-being
and positive relationships in adulthood. Rhodes et al.
(2006) posited that mentors help with adolescents' self-
worth because adolescents internalize the perceptions of
acceptance, support, and regard projected by their men-
tors. Likewise, adolescents in this study described their
mentors as being there for them, supporting them through
challenges, inspiring them to do better, and holding them
in high regard. Mentors likely also engage in positive
social interactions with adolescents where they develop
social and communications skills and learn to better
understand, express, and regulate their emotions and
behaviors (Rhodes et al., 2006). Aligned with this idea,
adolescents in our sample reported that their mentors set
examples and provided instruction for how to behave
socially, regulate emotions, and handle stressful situations.
Thus, our qualitative analyses offer validity and context to
our quantitative findings showing long-term associations
between mentoring and socioemotional competencies,
although we could not empirically demonstrate a connec-
tion between mentoring functions and prot
eg
e outcomes.
Cognitive Development
Participants who had mentors during adolescence, on
average, had greater education attainment than those who
did not, resembling previous findings linking natural
mentorships to greater educational achievement or attain-
ment (Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht & Wray-Lake, 2013).
This relationship showed the largest effect size of any out-
come we considered, highlighting the centrality of the
impact of mentoring on education. Further, these quantita-
tive findings were paralleled by our qualitative analysis of
mentoring functions associated with cognitive develop-
ment. In line with theory and past research, mentors aided
in cognitive development and supported academic success
by providing academic and professional guidance and
teaching prot
eg
es practical academic skills (Rhodes et al.,
2006; Tolan et al., 2014). Participants mentioned that
their mentors helped them with college applications and
schoolwork and taught them to navigate academia. Simi-
larly, mentors provided the social capital for academic
success (Chang et al., 2010) by serving as professional or
academic sponsors. For example, mentors wrote letters of
recommendation and helped their prot
eg
es access new
opportunities. These findings are in line with a large body
of literature focused on the academic benefits of youth
mentoring and, in particular, the role of mentors who are
educators with the academic expertise and skills to guide
students (Erickson et al., 2009; Fruiht & Wray-Lake,
2013).
Identity Development
The third mentoring function identified by Rhodes et al.
(2006) and supported by our qualitative analyses was iden-
tity development. Our quantitative analyses demonstrated
that having a naturally occurring mentor in adolescence
was not related to job satisfaction in adulthood. The major-
ity of participants, however, reported being satisfied or
extremely satisfied with their current job. It is possible that
there was not enough variation in responses to detect a
meaningful effect. Furthermore, it is possible that young
adults have not yet reached their career aspirations, and
the influence of mentoring in adolescence on job satisfac-
tion will manifest in later career stages. Given the often
demonstrated relationship between mentoring and aca-
demic success, as well as McDonald and Lambert's (2014)
findings about the relationship between mentoring and
intrinsically rewarding work in young adulthood, future
research should continue to explore the potential correlates
between youth mentoring and later work success.
A strong and positive sense of self may also contribute
to the impact of mentoring of reduced criminal behavior
as demonstrated by past studies (DuBois & Silverthorn,
2005a; Whitney et al., 2011). Expanding on past findings
by looking at young adult rather than emerging adult
behaviors, our results demonstrated that participants with
mentors in adolescence reported less criminal involvement
than those without mentors. This difference may result
56 Am J Community Psychol (2016) 57:47­59
from mentors supporting good decision making and pro-
viding adolescents with guidance and advice about how to
look at the long-term consequences of their choices. Fur-
thermore, mentors served as positive role models, encour-
aged ethical development, and protected their prot
eg
es
from harm--potentially helping adolescents to develop a
sense of identity that does not incorporate deviant roles--
as was suggested by past research (Rhodes et al., 2006;
Tolan et al., 2014).
Although most participants did not explicitly report an
impact on their sense of self or identity--many reported
mentoring functions provided by their mentors to support
the development of a positive identity. Mentors, for
instance, inspired their prot
eg
es to try new things, to
believe in themselves, and to make morally sound judg-
ments. Many participants also mentioned that their men-
tors served as role models or exemplars for the type of
people they wanted to be.
This support for identity overlaps in many ways with
supports for cognitive and socioemotional development, as
a positive sense of self or a strong identity as successful stu-
dent or citizen may benefit an individual socially, emotion-
ally, and academically. For instance, participants' mentors
actively supported them in staying motivated toward their
goals. Because goal setting and commitment have been con-
sistently shown to predict school retention (Covington,
2000), this may be another mechanism through which men-
tors promote academic success. Similarly, individuals with
high self-efficacy and sense of well-being perform better in
school (Gilman & Huebner, 2006) suggesting socioemo-
tional support may foster academic success as well.
A substantial strength of our taxonomy of mentoring
functions was that it drew from existing theories of youth,
adolescent, college, and career mentoring literatures to
develop a comprehensive catalog of functions provided by
mentors. Such a taxonomy provides a foundation for
future study of naturally occurring mentoring relationships
by making explicit the things that mentors do to support
positive development of their young prot
eg
es. Past con-
ceptualizations of youth mentoring functions have been
theoretical, whereas this taxonomy provides a more tangi-
ble framework on which to build future research. By
approaching data with these frameworks and allowing pre-
viously unidentified functions to emerge from the data,
for instance we were able to make note of cognitive men-
toring functions such as facilitating perspective taking and
teaching practical life and academic skills. Similarly, we
discovered that participants reported mentors promoting
their spiritual or religious development, and a mentoring
function has not been considered by past studies but is in
line with other qualitative findings that youth consider
spiritual support one function of a mentor (Fruiht, 2015).
These previously unrecognized functions likely aided ado-
lescents in perspective taking, metacognition, and the
skills necessary for academic success. One set of func-
tions that is represented in the data--but is not included
in the framework developed from Rhodes et al. (2006)
theory--is tangible support, such as financial support or
childcare. These practical means of support have been
identified by few past models of adolescent mentoring (cf.
Chen et al., 2003; Greeson et al., 2010; Schwartz et al.,
2013b) and made up a very small portion of overall
responses. However, their value should be considered by
future research. This nontraditional approach to qualitative
analysis provided a unique perspective on the data and
situated findings in existing theory, unlike purely data-
driven approaches used in past studies.
Limitations and Conclusions
These findings not only build upon and expand past
research about the long-term benefits of naturally occur-
ring mentoring relationships during adolescence but also
set the stage for future research to more thoroughly under-
stand the functions of natural mentors. By utilizing sec-
ondary data, we were able to use a large, nationally
representative sample of adolescents; however, as always
with secondary analyses, the study was constrained by the
items in the database. For instance, participants were only
able to nominate one mentor, rather than provide informa-
tion about the networks from which they might receive
support (Higgins & Kram, 2001). Moreover, this study
did not control for duration, closeness, or frequency of
contact with mentors, which previous studies have sug-
gested as potential moderators of the impact of mentoring
relationships. Additionally, asking youth to retrospectively
report about their mentors and functions of their mentors
may have led to biased reporting, and in particular,
attributing their own positive successes to the relationship
with the mentors. Instead, if youth were asked about their
mentors at each wave, we could have gained a much
clearer and precise understanding of age-related variations
or developmental patterns in types of mentoring functions.
For example, it is possible that mentors focus on career-
relevant themes with later adolescents and social skill
building in earlier adolescence. Youth reporting retrospec-
tively may have tended to over-report more recent func-
tions of their mentors, and so the taxonomy may
underrepresent the functions of mentors in early adoles-
cence. Similarly, participants provided just one example
of the primary form of support received from their
mentors. While this was useful in creating a taxonomy of
support, it did not allow us to look at the impact of
specific mentoring functions on later outcomes to link
the qualitative and quantitative analyses. Despite these
Am J Community Psychol (2016) 57:47­59 57
limitations, this study improves our understanding the
ways that natural mentoring relationships are meaningful
in the development of adolescents and young adults.
Better understanding the mentoring functions provided
by mentors is a critical step in strengthening the body of
research surrounding youth and adolescent mentoring.
Without a clear taxonomy of the functions of mentors,
researchers have no clear parameters for studying the differ-
ent types of support that mentors provide and develop new,
unstandardized, procedures for operationalizing youth men-
toring goals for each new project (e.g., Chen et al., 2003;
Greeson et al., 2010). Thus, this taxonomy will provide a
foundation from which to work as future studies investigate
the mechanisms through which mentoring happens. Simi-
larly, future research could assess the connection between
the mentoring functions we summarized here and compe-
tencies in adolescence and adulthood. While we could not
address this connection given the single item measuring the
primary function of the mentoring relationship, in-depth
interviews on the topic of mentoring or a self-report inven-
tory of received mentoring functions could be used to assess
what types of supports a mentor provided. This could then
be connected, using a longitudinal data collection, to com-
petencies in later life to see the connection between specific
youth mentoring functions and thriving in adulthood. In
addition to its benefit to the research community, the taxon-
omy of youth mentoring functions may be used to improve
the effectiveness of formal mentoring programs as well as
to provide suggestions for best practices to naturally occur-
ring mentors in the community.
Taken together, this study's longitudinal results and
taxonomy of mentoring functions provides a platform for
researchers, mentoring programs, and mentors to under-
stand the developmental implications and processes by
which mentoring can make a lasting difference in the lives
of adolescents.
