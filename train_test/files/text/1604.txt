Abstract
Background: Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003­2004 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey
(NHANES) study cycle for objective assessment of physical activity. This is the first time that objective physical activity data are
available on a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The use of accelerometers allows researchers to measure total
physical activity, including light intensity and unstructured activities, which may be a better predictor of health outcomes than
structured activity alone. The aim of this study was to examine objectively determined physical activity levels by sex, age and
racial/ethnic groups in a national sample of U.S. adults.
Methods: Data were obtained from the 2003­2004 NHANES, a cross-sectional study of a complex, multistage probability
sample of the U.S. population. Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164 accelerometer for seven days following
an examination. 2,688 U.S. adults with valid accelerometer data (i.e. at least four days with at least 10 hours of wear-time) were
included in the analysis. Mean daily total physical activity counts, as well as counts accumulated in minutes of light, and moderate-
vigorous intensity physical activity are presented by sex across age and racial/ethnic groups. Generalized linear modeling using
the log link function was performed to compare physical activity in sex and racial/ethnic groups adjusting for age.
Results: Physical activity decreases with age for both men and women across all racial/ethnic groups with men being more active
than women, with the exception of Hispanic women. Hispanic women are more active at middle age (40­59 years) compared
to younger or older age and not significantly less active than men in middle or older age groups (i.e. age 40­59 or age 60 and
older). Hispanic men accumulate more total and light intensity physical activity counts than their white and black counterparts
for all age groups.
Conclusion: Physical activity levels measured objectively by accelerometer demonstrated that Hispanic men are, in general,
more active than their white and black counterparts. This appears to be in contrast to self-reported physical activity previously
reported in the literature and identifies the need to use objective measures in situations where the contribution of light intensity
and/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed homogenous across the populations of interest.

Background
Physical activity can prevent and delay the onset of
chronic diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease [1,2].
Despite this, inactivity is common in the United States.
National surveillance systems have included measures of
physical activity allowing researchers to measure trends in
physical activity as well as identify groups that are physi-
cally inactive. Historically, national reports, such as the
Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), have incorporated subjective measures (e.g.
questionnaires) because of their low cost and ease of use,
which makes them ideal for large population studies.
However, objective measures, such as pedometers, which
count steps, and accelerometers, which measure move-
ment intensity, are starting to be utilized to assess physical
activity levels in population studies [3-6].
Both subjective and objective assessment tools have
advantages and disadvantages depending on the popula-
tion being studied and the research question being inves-
tigated [7]. Subjective measures often provide detailed
information regarding type of activity. However, because
they rely on self-report of activity they are subject to
response bias and recall bias. In particular, they have lim-
ited accuracy at capturing activities that are unstructured,
and of light intensity [8], both of which tend to be per-
formed in greater frequency in women and in older pop-
ulations [9-11]. Thus, using a subjective measure of
physical activity may not provide an accurate description
of activity in these groups. It is important to measure total
physical activity (which includes light intensity and
unstructured activities) because it may have a greater
impact on several health outcomes, such as diabetes, com-
pared to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity alone [12-
14]. Objective measures, such as accelerometers, do not
provide detailed information on the type of activities
being performed. However, they do record physical activ-
ity across all intensities and are not subject to the biases of
self-report. In addition, accelerometers can be used to esti-
mate the time spent in light, moderate, and high intensity
physical activity and the contribution of each to total
physical activity [15].
Accelerometers were incorporated in the 2003­2004
NHANES study cycle for objective assessment of physical
activity. This is the first time that objective physical activ-
ity data are available on a nationally representative sam-
ple of U.S. residents. A previous effort by Troiano et al
focuses on physical activity at moderate-to-vigorous levels
of intensity describing, on a population level, who's meet-
ing the Surgeon General's recommendations of physical
activity using this accelerometry data from NHANES [6].
In contrast, given the potential importance of total physi-
cal activity, the current effort includes assessments of light
intensity activity and moderate-vigorous intensity activity
to examine differences in physical activity by sex, age and
racial/ethnic groups in a national sample of adults.
Methods
Study Population and Procedures
NHANES is a cross-sectional observational study con-
ducted by the National Center for Health Statistics of the
Centers for Disease Control that uses a stratified, multi-
stage probability design to obtain a nationally representa-
tive sample of the U.S. household population [16]. The
survey population includes randomly selected neighbor-
hoods in the United States. From these neighborhoods,
random households are selected to incorporate individu-
als in this study. During the 2003­2004 NHANES study
cycle, 12,761 individuals were selected for recruitment. Of
those selected, 10,122 individuals (79%) agreed to partic-
ipate in the study.
NHANES 2003­2004 consisted of an interview, physical
examination, and laboratory tests conducted in mobile
examination centers (MEC) by trained staff. Physical
activity assessment was restricted to NHANES participants
who were not prevented by impairments from walking or
wearing an accelerometer. Our analysis was further
restricted to individuals who were at least 18 years of age,
not pregnant, and never reported having had a stroke,
congestive heart failure, angina, emphysema, chronic
bronchitis, or renal dialysis to exclude individuals whose
physical activity was limited because of illness or health
status (N = 3840). Fewer than 5% of the remaining partic-
ipants reported a race other than non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black or Hispanic so they were subse-
quently excluded from this analysis due to insufficient
sample size (N = 149). Participants who had at least four
days of valid accelerometer data with relevant covariates
were used in the analysis (N = 2688) (Figure 1).
Measures
Physical Activity
Physical activity was assessed with the Actigraph AM-7164
accelerometer (formerly the CSA/MTI AM-7164, manu-
factured by ActiGraph of Ft. Walton Beach, Florida, USA),
which is a pager size device powered by a small lithium
battery. The accelerometers were attached to an elasticized
belt and worn on the right hip. The accelerometer meas-
ures the duration and intensity of physical activity by cap-
turing the magnitude of acceleration (intensity) and
summing up the magnitudes (intensity counts) within a
specified time interval (epoch). A one-minute epoch was
used by NHANES.
Participants were asked to wear the device for seven days
while they were awake, and to take it off for swimming or
bathing. Monitors were returned by express mail to

NHANES, where data were downloaded from the device,
and the device was checked to determine whether it was
still within the manufacturer's calibration specifications
using an Actigraph calibrator.
NHANES used standardized data quality procedures to
assess the validity and reliability of the accelerometry
data, which are described in more detail elsewhere [17]. In
brief, participants with at least four days in which the
accelerometer was worn for at least 600 minutes are
included in analysis. Any block of time greater than or
equal to 60 minutes where the activity count was equal to
zero was considered time when the monitor was not
worn. Based on a previous calibration study by Freedson
and colleagues, a minute of accelerometer data was coded
as sedentary if it contained less than 260 activity counts. A
minute was coded as light physical activity if it recorded
an accelerometer count between 260­1951. A minute was
coded as moderate-vigorous intensity if activity counts
were greater than or equal to 1952 [18]. Counts derived
during minutes of light and moderate-vigorous activity
respectively, were individually summed and divided by
the number of days worn to calculate daily averages for
those specific intensities. Total physical activity was the
sum of the counts derived during minutes of light and
moderate-vigorous activity.
Demographics and Anthropometrics
Participants were categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Hispanic (including Mexican Ameri-
can and other Hispanic) based on self-report. Age in years
was calculated from self-report. Participants over the age
of 85 were assigned the age of 85 to protect confidential-
ity. For descriptive purposes, activity was tabulated by age
groups: 18­39, 40­59 and 60 or more years. Body Mass
Index (BMI) was calculated (BMI) (kg/m2) from height
and weight, which were measured at MEC using standard-
ized protocol and equipment. General health status was
self-reported as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.
Data Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using STATA 10.0
(StataCorp Stata Statistical Software: Release 10.1. Stata-
Corp LP: College Station, TX, 2007). For all analyses, sig-
nificance was set at an alpha level of <0.05. Unadjusted
values were calculated stratified by sex, race/ethnicity and
age groups. Generalized linear modeling using the log
link function was performed to compare total, light, and
moderate-vigorous activity counts by sex and race/ethnic
groups adjusting for age and age-squared because it's non-
linear relationship with physical activity. To determine
whether there were interactions between age and race in
either males or females interaction terms were added to
the models. All analysis took into account the complex
survey design of NHANES, which includes weighting,
stratification and clustering.
Results
Demographic characteristics of the 2,688 participants are
presented in Table 1. Participants were stratified by sex
and race/ethnicity to form six groups that consisted of
white men, black men, Hispanic men and white women,
black women and Hispanic women. As a group, Hispanic
men and women on average appeared to be younger than
their white and black counterparts. The majority of the
participants in the study were in good or very good health
which is reflective of inclusion criteria because we whose
physical activity may possibly be limited by underlying
conditions.
Age-adjusted physical activity counts by race/ethnicity
and gender are presented in Table 2. Hispanic men
appeared to have both higher age-adjusted total and light
activity counts compared to white and black men (p <
0.01). Moderate-vigorous physical activity followed a sim-
ilar pattern of higher counts in Hispanic men but the dif-

ference was not statistically significant (p = 0.13).
Likewise, Hispanic women appeared to have significantly
higher counts of light intensity physical activity compared
to their white and black counterparts (p = 0.02). Total
activity followed a similar pattern of higher counts in His-
panic women but the difference did not reach statistical
significance (p = 0.14). Moderate -vigorous physical activ-
ity counts appeared to be similar in women (p = 0.50).
There was a statistically significant interaction with regard
to age for Hispanic men, which suggests that Hispanic
men experience a faster decline in moderate-vigorous
physical activity with increasing age (p = 0.03). No other
significant interactions were noted (data not shown).
Physical activity counts per day for total, light, and mod-
erate-to-vigorous intensity stratified by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity are presented in Table 3. When stratifying by age
group, the pattern of higher activity counts in Hispanic
men remained, however, significance was only reached in
total and light activity in the youngest age groups (p =
0.001 and p = 0.002 respectively). There was also a pattern
for higher activity counts in Hispanic women in the mid-
dle age groups, reaching significance for total and light
activity (p = 0.006 and p = 0.003 respectively). Women
appeared to have similar activity counts across race/eth-
nicity groups in the younger and older age groups.
Discussion
The current study examined objectively measured physi-
cal activity data collected on a nationally representative
sample of U.S. adults and thus provided a unique oppor-
tunity to investigate total physical activity and various lev-
els of physical activity intensity across racial/ethnic and
sex groups. The most striking findings were the relatively

higher amounts of physical activity among Hispanic men
and women compared to their male and female counter-
parts.
This current effort indentified a pattern of higher physical
activity levels in Hispanic men compared to white and
black men. The results also indicate that Hispanic women
engage in more light physical activity compared to their
white and black counterparts. This is in contrast to previ-
ous results from national surveys, which have indicated
that Hispanic men and women are less active compared to
their white and black counterparts. Results from the
1994­2004 BRFSS showed that Hispanic men and
women reported greater amounts of inactivity than white
men and women [19]. However, the pattern of higher
objectively measured physical activity in Hispanic men
was also shown in a study by Bennett et al which showed
higher pedometer step counts for Hispanic men com-
pared to their white and black counterparts, though not
reaching significance [20]. A previous paper by Troiano et
al using NHANES accelerometry data also showed that
Hispanic men and women were more active than white
and black men and women at moderate-to-vigorous levels
of intensity [6]. This effort expands on the work by Troi-
ano by including total activity encompassing all levels of
intensity and comes to the same conclusion. Another
effort using the NHANES population was conducted by
Matthews et al which looked at time spent in sedentary
activity using the accelerometer [21]. The results of the
study indicated that Hispanic men and women spent less
time in sedentary activity than their white and black coun-
terparts.
Additionally, physical activity was found to be inversely
associated with age at all levels of intensity in all racial/
ethnic groups with the exception of Hispanic women. This
finding is consistent with results of previous studies using
subjective data [22,23] suggesting a general pattern of
decreasing physical activity levels with increasing age. This
finding is also in line with the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS) which showed that adults in the 65+ years
age group were about five times more likely than adults in
the 18­24 years age group to report never being physical
active [24]. Likewise, results from the Behavioral Risk Fac-
tor Surveillance System (BRFSS) indicated that 35% of
men and 54% of women aged 75+ years reported engag-
ing in no physical activity compared to 15% of men and
20% women aged 18­29 years who reported engaging in
no physical activity [19]. A national representative study
of Swedish adults by Hagstromer et al, using accelerome-
tery, also noted that physical activity levels decreased with
age [4].
The 2003­2004 NHANES accelerometer effort found men
to be more physically active than women across all age
groups with the exception of Hispanic women in the mid-
dle age group. There were no significant differences in
total, light, or moderate-vigorous activity when compar-
ing men to Hispanic women (p = 0.36, p = 0.34, and p =
0.61 respectively) in the middle age group. These findings

need further investigation into what factors cause higher
levels of activity in Hispanic women in the middle age
group.
There are important limitations worth noting when inter-
preting accelerometry data. Accelerometers do not pro-
vide qualitative information on what types of physical
activities are being performed (household, transportation,
leisure, etc.). Future studies will be needed to identify the
specific areas in which Hispanic male and females accu-
mulate more activity than their white and black counter-
parts. Accelerometers are also unable to capture upper
arm movement. Thus, a portion of activity can be missed
(e.g. weight lifting). Walking gait must also be taken into
consideration because it can affect the validity of acceler-
ometer counts, especially in older adults. For example,
some accelerometers are more likely to undercount activ-
ity in adults with a non-standard gait [25]. This bias
should be minimal because we excluded individuals
whose physical activity would likely be affected by illness
or health status.
Conclusion
The current study is one of only a few studies utilizing an
objective assessment of physical activity in a large repre-
sentative sample of U.S. adults. Findings from this study
will serve as a basis for comparison of objectively meas-
ured physical activity across sex and racial/ethnic groups
in future efforts. It is important to be able to identify pock-
ets of the population that are currently inactive to be able
to focus future intervention efforts. The reasons that cer-
tain groups may be inactive may be are likely multi-facto-
rial and may be related to many factors including socio-
economic factors and the built environment which are
not identified in this study. Furthermore, this study iden-
tifies the need to use objective measures of physical activ-
ity in situations where the contribution of light intensity
and/or unstructured physical activity cannot be assumed
homogenous within the population of interest.
