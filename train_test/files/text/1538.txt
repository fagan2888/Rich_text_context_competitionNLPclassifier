Short paper
The "fit but fat" concept revisited:
population-based estimates using NHANES
Glen E Duncan
Abstract
Low cardiovascular fitness is an independent risk factor for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adults. The "fit
but fat" concept suggests that cardiovascular fitness attenuates risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease
independent of body mass index (BMI), even among the obese. However, the proportion of U.S. adults considered both
fit and obese is unknown. Thus, the purposes of this short paper were to estimate the proportion of U.S. adults who are
obese yet have a high cardiovascular fitness level (fit but fat), and determine the independent effect of obesity on
cardiovascular fitness. The study was a secondary data analysis of 4,675 adults (20-49 years) who completed a
submaximal exercise test, from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2002). Cardiovascular
fitness and body weight were expressed as continuous (estimated VO2max
[ml.kg-1.min-1] and BMI [kg/m2]) and
categorical variables (low, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness level; normal weight, overweight, and obese), the
later using sex and age-specific criteria from the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study and standard BMI cut-points,
respectively. Using these methods, the prevalence of meeting the fit but fat definition among U.S. adults was 8.9%
(95% C.I. = 6.9 - 10.9%), whereas 17.4% were overweight and high fit, and 30% were normal weight and high fit.
Importantly, the proportion of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular fitness differed significantly (p < 0.05) by BMI
level. Using multiple regression, being obese was associated with a 9.2% lower estimated VO2max
compared to being
normal weight, even after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income. These results suggest that a small
percentage of U.S. adults can be considered fit but fat, and that obesity is independently associated with reduced
cardiovascular fitness. The likely explanation for the low proportion of U.S. adults who can be considered fit but fat is a
low level of physical activity, which constributes to both a positive energy balance and low fitness. Thus, engaging
obese adults in physical activity that is sufficient to improve cardiovascular fitness may help to reduce not only body
weight, but the excess health burden in this population.
Background
High levels of physical activity and/or cardiovascular fit-
ness attenuate health risks associated with overweight
and obesity [1-11], although it is unclear whether activity
or fitness can eliminate the risks [12,13]. A common rec-
ommendation to improve both cardiovascular fitness and
promote weight loss in the overweight and obese is to
increase physical activity [14]. However, physical activity
levels in the population are well below those recom-
mended for health benefits [15], and rates of physician
counseling about healthful lifestyles in overweight and
obese patients is also typically low [16].
Given the high rates of obesity and low rates of physical
activity in the population, it is unclear how many U.S.
adults might be considered both fit and obese ("fit but
fat"). The purpose of this short paper was to estimate the
proportion of U.S. adults who are clinically obese by body
mass index standards (BMI), yet have a high cardiovascu-
lar fitness level as estimated from exercise testing in a
population-based study. The author hypothesized that
cardiovascular fitness levels differ significantly by BMI
levels, and that obesity is independently associated with
reduced cardiovascular fitness.

test, from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002. The NHANES proto-
col was reviewed and approved by the National Center
for Health Statistic's Institutional Review Board. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants
prior to testing.
Testing
Detailed procedures for the cardiovascular fitness com-
ponent of NHANES are available elsewhere [17]. Briefly,
participants were screened using questionnaires and
physical examination. Individuals were excluded from
testing based on certain medical conditions, medication
usage, and physical limitations that would interfere with
cardiovascular responses to exercise. The fitness exam
was performed by health technicians trained using a
common protocol. The goal of each test was to elicit a
heart rate that was approximately 75% of the age-pre-
dicted maximum (220-age). The test included a 2-minute
warm-up, two 3-minute exercise stages, and a 2-minute
cool down period. Heart rate was monitored continu-
ously, and blood pressure was measured at the end of
each stage, using an automated electronic monitor. Test-
ing was terminated in persons who exhibited abnormal
signs or symptoms (e.g., pain or pressure in the chest), or
heart rate or blood pressure responses (e.g., heart rate >
85% of predicted maximal heart rate, blood pressure >
260 or 115 mmHg) during the warm-up or at the end of a
stage.
Measures
The primary outcome was estimated VO2max
(ml.kg-
1.min-1), calculated from the heart rate response to known
levels of submaximal work. Using sex and age-specific
criteria for adults 20-49 yr. from the Aerobics Center
Longitudinal Study (ACLS), the estimated VO2max
was
also categorized as a low, moderate, or high level of car-
diovascular fitness. Specifically, low cardiovascular fit-
ness was an estimated VO2max
below the 20th percentile of
the ACLS data of the same sex and age group, moderate
fitness was between the 20th and 59th percentiles, and
high fitness at or above the 60th percentile.
Height was measured with a stadiometer, and weight
on a self-zeroing scale with no shoes and wearing light
clothing. BMI was calculated as kg/m2 (continuous vari-
able), and also expressed as a categorical variable using
standard cut-points, where normal weight was BMI < 25,
overweight BMI > 25 <30, and obese BMI > 30. Demo-
graphic variables were obtained by self-report.
Analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS version 9.2 with survey
software. All analyses used the four-year full sample
weights (wtmec4yr) to estimate means and 95% confi-
dence intervals (CI), and the corresponding masked vari-
ance units (pseudo-primary sampling units [SDMVPSU]
and pseudo-stratum variables [SDMVSTRA]) to estimate
standard errors of those means. Differences among con-
tinuous outcomes by BMI level were tested using linear
regression. Prevalence and differences for cardiovascular
fitness level by BMI level were compared using the Wald
2 test of association. The procedure provides design-
adjusted tests of independence (no association) between
row (fitness level) and column (BMI level) variables. Mul-
tiple linear regression was used to examine associations
between cardiovascular fitness and BMI. Statistical sig-
nificance was established at  = 0.05 a priori, and multi-
ple comparisons were adjusted using the Bonferroni
method. Six participants who had extreme estimated
VO2max
values ( 87.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, which were above the
99th percentile of the sample distribution), and all partici-
pants with missing or negative sampling weights (n =
230), were excluded from analysis.

56.3 ± 2.1% high fitness. With respect to BMI level, over-
all 44.9 ± 2.0% subjects were normal weight, 34.7 ± 1.8%
overweight, and 20.4 ± 1.1% obese.
Differences in major outcomes by BMI level are pro-
vided in Table 2. There was no difference (p > 0.05)
among groups for age. However, estimated VO2max
(ml.kg-1.min-1) was significantly higher in both normal
weight and overweight groups, compared to the obese (p
< 0.05). The distribution of cardiovascular fitness level
differed significantly (p < 0.05) by BMI status. Overall,
8.9% of subjects were obese and had a high cardiovascular
fitness level, 17.4% were overweight and high fit, and 30%
were normal weight and high fit.
The distribution of cardiovascular fitness levels within
each BMI level is provided in Figure 1. The proportion of
subjects with a high cardiovascular fitness level was over
20 percentage points lower in obese compared to normal
weight adults, whereas the percentage of low cardiovas-
cular fitness was roughly 15 percentage points higher in
the obese compared to normal weight.
Regression models were constructed to examine associ-
ations between estimated VO2max
(ml.kg-1.min-1) and
BMI, which was entered both as a continuous and cate-
gorical variable. In the best fitting model (r2 = 0.263),
using categorical BMI, being obese was associated with a
9.2% and overweight a 6.1% lower estimated VO2max
,
compared to being normal weight, controlling for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, and income (both p < 0.05).
Discussion
The fit but fat concept suggests that high levels of cardio-
vascular fitness attenuate or potentially eliminate risks
associated with several metabolic and cardiovascular dis-
ease outcomes independent of BMI, even among individ-
uals who are obese. This study demonstrates that a
relatively small percentage of U.S. adults, about 9%, can
be considered fit but fat. Furthermore, obesity is indepen-
dently associated with reduced cardiovascular fitness at
the population level. In contrast, about 17% of U.S. adults
completing the fitness-testing component of NHANES

were overweight and had a high cardiovascular fitness
level, while 30% were normal weight and high fit.
The distribution of cardiovascular fitness levels among
U.S. adults differed significantly by BMI level. Both sex
and race/ethnicity also differed significantly by BMI level
(data not shown). Of note, there was a higher relative pro-
portion of Non-Hispanic Black and lower proportion of
Non-Hispanic White adults in the obese group. This dif-
ference may have contributed to the difference found in
the distribution of high cardiovascular fitness levels
across BMI levels. This is based on reports that Non-His-
panic Black adults, particularly women, have lower car-
diovascular fitness levels than do other major race/
ethnicity groups tested in the NHANES sample [18,19].
Although the percentage of adults who were fit but fat
as defined in this study was relatively small across BMI
levels in the population (Table 2), a different picture
emerges when examining cardiovascular fitness levels
within each BMI level. Among obese adults, about 20%
had a low cardiovascular fitness level whereas 80%
achieved a medium or high level (Figure 1). Among the
overweight, 12.5% had low cardiovascular fitness and
87.5% had medium or high fitness. These findings are
somewhat encouraging because they demonstrate that
overweight and obese individuals can achieve a medium
to high cardiovascular fitness level, which could poten-
tially mitigate some of the deleterious effects of excess
body weight on health.
Of course, not all studies demonstrate that high levels
of cardiovascular fitness attenuate health risks indepen-
dently of excess body weight, perhaps refuting the fit but
fat concept. For example, Stevens and colleagues [9] con-
cluded that although both fitness and fatness were risk
factors for mortality, being fit did not completely reverse
the increased risk associated with excess adiposity. Chris-
tou et al. [20] found that body fatness was a better predic-
tor of cardiovascular disease risk profile than aerobic
fitness in healthy men. Finally, in the Quebec Family
Study [21], the effects of physical fitness on individual
components of the metabolic syndrome were attenuated
after considering total and abdominal adiposity.
Similarly, several studies have demonstrated that BMI
may be more important than is physical activity in pre-
dicting development of adverse health outcomes [22-24].
However, it is difficult to compare "head to head" results
of various studies examining the relationships among
physical activity and/or physical fitness and BMI and/or
adiposity with health because these measures describe
different concepts and are therefore not interchangeable.
Indeed, as Blair and colleagues suggest in a comprehen-
sive review [25], it is not possible at this time to conclude
whether activity or fitness is more important for health.
Several limitations are noteworthy. First, NHANES is a
cross-sectional survey, which negates drawing causal
inferences as to the underlying relationship between car-
diovascular fitness and obesity. Related, BMI is an imper-
fect surrogate measure of adiposity and the potential for
misclassification has been documented [26,27]. There is
also potential for misclassification of fitness level using an
estimate of cardiovascular fitness from a submaximal
instead of a maximal, graded exercise test. Differences in
the proportions of low, moderate, and high cardiovascu-
lar fitness among BMI levels may have been caused by a
potential for bias or misclassification because the cut-
points used to define these levels were derived from the
ACLS, which is a mostly well-educated, white sample.
Finally, the distribution of cardiovascular fitness levels by
BMI levels among U.S. adults provided in this report may
not reflect the actual distribution in the population
because of the select age and physical status of the sample
completing exercise testing in NHANES.
Despite the limitations noted, this study demonstrates
that few U.S. adults are both highly fit and obese across
the population. However, the data also demonstrate that
obese and overweight adults can achieve a moderate to
high level of cardiovascular fitness. The 20% or so most
unfit overweight and obese adults are therefore optimal
targets for intervention. Because the common recom-
mendation to improve both cardiovascular fitness and
promote weight loss in the overweight and obese is to
increase physical activity [14], the findings from this
report might better serve to suggest that obese and over-
weight individuals not only move around more (i.e.,
increase habitual physical activity), but that they move
around more at a level that is sufficient to improve car-
diovascular fitness (i.e., activity of a sufficient dose).
Although changes in cardiovascular fitness in response to
training are variable and determined in part by genetic
and common environmental factors [28-30], even small
increases in activity and/or fitness may provide health
benefits.
