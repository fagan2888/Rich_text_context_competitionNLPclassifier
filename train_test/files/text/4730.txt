Abstract
Objectives: Ephrin type B receptor 4 (EphB4, Eph receptor) selectively binds ephrin B2 (Eph
ligand). EphB4/ephrin B2 is involved in embryonic vessel development, vascular remodelling and
pathological vessel formation in adults (including tumour angiogenesis). Binding of vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A to the endothelial-specific receptor VEGF receptor-2 is the
main extracellular signal triggering angiogenic response. Little is known about the role of EphB4/
ephrin B2 during angiogenesis and arteriovenous plasticity in cerebral arteriovenous malformation
(cAVM). This study investigated EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression in cAVM.
Methods: Haemorrhagic (H-AVM) and nonhaemorrhagic (NH-AVM) specimens of AVM nidus,
obtained after microsurgical cAVM resection, and normal superficial temporal artery (STA)
specimens, were analysed retrospectively. VEGF-A, EphB4 and ephrin B2 expression were studied
by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting.
Results: In cAVM (10 H-AVM; 10 NH-AVM), VEGF-A was immunocytochemically localized to
endothelial cells; strong endothelial cell staining was found for EphB4 in veins and ephrin B2 in
arteries. Normal STA (n ¼ 10) did not express EphB4 or ephrin B2. EphB4 and ephrin B2
expression was greater in H-AVM than in NH-AVM.
Conclusions: Endothelial cells are more active in H-AVM than NH-AVM. EphB4 and ephrin B2
play important roles in neovascularization and arteriovenous differentiation/plasticity. These data
provide new insights into the aetiology of cAVM and lay a foundation for further study. The notch
pathway induced by VEGF-A may be a key signalling pathway in this process.

Introduction
Ephrin type B receptor 4 (EphB4) belongs to
the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family.
RTKs are a diverse group of transmembrane
proteins that, on receiving an external stimu-
lus, respond by transmitting a signal to the
inside of the cell and thus control the cell's
shape, proliferation, differentiation and
migration.1,2 RTKs have key roles in
normal physiology and in oncogenesis.3
EphB4 selectively binds ephrin B2 and no
other ephrin B ligands.4 Unlike other
families of RTKs, which bind soluble lig-
ands, Eph receptors interact with ephrin
ligands bound to the cell surface; these
ligands can transmit signals on receptor
engagement in a phenomenon known as
bidirectional signalling. Ephrin B ligands,
which possess a transmembrane and a cyto-
plasmic domain, are tyrosine phosphory-
lated on receptor binding, which induces
ephrin reverse signalling in addition to
receptor forward signalling.5 This type of
signalling establishes the mechanistic basis
of junction formation between arterial and
venous endothelial cells through the restric-
tion of cellular intermingling.6,7 EphB4 and
its cognate ligand ephrin B2 play important
roles in embryonic vessel development and
vascular remodelling.8
Cerebral arteriovenous malformations
(cAVMs) comprise tangles of abnormally
formed blood vessels, and are an important
cause of intracranial haemorrhage and
seizure in young adults.9 They are histo-
pathologically characterized by the pres-
ence of a nidus, consisting of a
conglomerate of tortuous vessels lacking
capillaries, an arterial feeder and a drain-
ing vein.10 cAVMs have long been thought
to arise from developmental derangements
(at the embryonic, fetal or early postnatal
stage of vessel formation), whereby abnor-
mal vascular formation results in contin-
ued vascular remodelling due to a chronic
increase in blood flow during postnatal
growth.11­13 Their course cannot easily be
predicted; they may remain static, grow or
even regress. Angiogenesis and arterioven-
ous plasticity therefore play important
roles in the formation and development
of cAVMs. Several reports suggest that
EphB4/ephrin B2 is also involved in patho-
logical vessel formation in adults, including
tumour angiogenesis,14­16 but little is
known about its role during angiogenesis
or in arteriovenous plasticity in cAVM.
The purpose of this retrospective study was
to explore the expression of EphB4 and
ephrin B2 in cAVM.
Patients and methods
This study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of Beijing Tiantan Hospital,
Capital Medical University, Beijing. All
individuals providing data for use in this
study were registered as inpatients of
Beijing Tiantan Hospital. Written consent
to obtain clinical specimens and to publish
data obtained in the study was obtained
from the participants, or from the guard-
ians of participants who were <18 years
of age.
Patients
The study retrospectively included samples
from patients with cAVM, with or without
haemorrhage, admitted to the Department
of Neurosurgery at Beijing Tiantan Hospital
between January 2011 and July 2011; the
patients included both emergency admis-
sions and routine admissions. The samples
and data included in this study were ran-
domly selected for inclusion using a com-
puter program. Digital subtraction
angiography, computed tomography and
magnetic resonance imaging were used for
evaluation before and after surgery, using
standard techniques. The Spetzler­Martin
grading system (www.neurosurgic.com) for
arteriovenous malformations was used
to confirm that the surgical risk for
406 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
participating patients with cAVM was
acceptable. All patients underwent surgical
cAVM resection, which was a routine aspect
of their care and was undertaken using
standard techniques. After surgery, the diag-
nosis of cAVM was confirmed pathologic-
ally. Also included in the study were head
trauma patients with structurally normal
superficial temporal arteries (STAs), who
served as controls; the controls were not
matched to the treatment group. Head
trauma patients with cerebrovascular dis-
eases, tumours or other systemic diseases
were excluded.
Tissue specimens
Tissue specimens were obtained from each
patient after microsurgical cAVM resection.
The cAVM nidus was dissected away from
adjacent brain tissue in the operating room,
and a representative portion of malformed
AVM nidal tissue was immediately placed in
an aluminium container and submerged in
liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues were stored
at À80C until analysis, which was under-
taken $2 months after excision. Specimens
of structurally normal STA tissue were
obtained from the control patients and
were collected, frozen and stored in the
same manner as the cAVM specimens.
Immunohistochemistry
The frozen tissue samples were cut into
5­6 mm-thick sections for haematoxylin
and eosin staining, and for immunohisto-
chemical staining for EphB4, ephrin B2 and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
After holding for 20 min at room tempera-
ture, frozen sections were fixed in standard
acetone for 10 min. Procedures for immu-
nohistochemistry were as described else-
where.17,18 Briefly, anti-EphB4 antibody
(rabbit monoclonal, dilution 1:150; Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), anti-ephrin
B2 antibody (mouse polyclonal, dilution
1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-
VEGF-A antibody (mouse polyclonal, dilu-
tion 1:500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were
used for immunohistochemical staining;
antirabbit and antimouse secondary antibo-
dies were used to detect these antibodies.
Tissue sections were counterstained with
nuclear fast blue. Microscopy examinations
were undertaken with a DMI4000 micro-
scope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany); magnifi-
cations ranged between Â50 and Â200,
and 10 scopes were visualized in every
tissue section; the average (mean Æ SD) was
then calculated for each sample.
Immunohistochemistry results were rec-
orded as scores for the percentage of cells
staining positively, and scores for staining
intensity. The percentage of cells staining
positively was scored 0 ( 10% positive
cells), 1 (11­25%), 2 (26­50%), 3 (51­75%)
or 4 (>75%). Staining intensity was scored 0
(negative), 1 (weak), 2 (medium) or 3
(strong). The product of the two scores was
regarded as the total score for protein
expression; total scores were categorized as
À (score 0), þ (<6), or þþ (!6).
Immunoblotting assays
Equal amounts (10 mg) of protein from
tissue lysates were separated by sodium
dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes and probed with primary and
secondary antibodies. Additional antibodies
used were anti-EphB4 antibody (rabbit
monoclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology;
dilution 1:500) and anti-ephrin B2 anti-
body (mouse polyclonal; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; 1:500). Band intensity was
analysed using a KodakÕ Gel Logic imaging
system (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems,
Rochester, NY, USA) and Quantity OneÕ
(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) software.
b-Actin (dilution 1:1500; Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) was used
as a control.

Statistical analyses
All results were expressed as mean Æ SD.
SPSSÕ statistical software, version 13.0
(SPSS Inc. Chicago. IL., USA) was used
for analyses. The Kolmogorov­Smirnov test
was used to test for normal distribution of
all quantitative data; 2-test was used for
comparisons between two sets of data.
Single-factor analysis of variance and the
Kruskal­Wallis test were used for compari-
sons among three sets of data. P < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
This study included data from 20 patients
(15 male and five female) with cAVM; their
mean age was 28.3 years (range, 8­59 years).
The first presentation was with haemorrhage
in 10 patients and without haemorrhage in
the remaining 10 patients; two patients
haemorrhaged twice and three patients
underwent radiosurgery before cAVM
resection (Table 1). Also included in the
study were control data from 20 patients
(17 male and three female; mean age, 32.5
years [range, 12­56 years]), each of
whom had head trauma with a structurally
normal STA.
Haematoxylin and eosin staining of a
frozen cAVM section showed partial frag-
mentation of the endothelial layer, vascu-
lar stenosis and deformation and
endothelial cell hypertrophy (Figure 1A).
Immunocytochemical analysis of VEGF-A
in cAVM confirmed the localization of

All cAVM specimens revealed strong stain-
ing for EphB4 and ephrin B2 in vascular
endothelial cells; EphB4 was located in
the venous endothelium (Figure 1C, D),
whereas ephrin B2 was located in the
arterial endothelium (Figure 1E, F).
Immunocytochemical analysis of EphB4 in
frozen cAVM sections confirmed that
EphB4 was expressed in mature and imma-
ture vessels (Figure 1D). Neither EphB4 nor
ephrin B2 was expressed in normal STA
(Figure 1G, H); the brown staining in
figure 1G is not true staining in the vascular
endothelial cell.
In immunoblotting assays (Figure 2, a­c),
expression of EphB4 was greater in both
haemorrhagic cAVM (H-AVM) and non-
haemorrhagic cAVM (NH-AVM) than in
normal STA. EphB4 expression was greater
in H-AVM than in NH-AVM; band inten-
sity percentages with respect to the control
(b-actin) differed significantly among
groups (STA, 15.51 Æ 2.11%; NH-AVM,
48.75 Æ 7.16%; H-AVM, 59.04 Æ 9.74%,

ephrin B2 was greater in both H-AVM and
NH-AVM than in normal STA, and was
greater in H-AVM than in NH-AVM; band
intensity percentages differed significantly

Discussion
Angiogenesis involves a process in which
trophoblastic blood vessels send out capil-
lary sprouts to form new tube-like struc-
tures.9 This complex, multistep process
begins with an increase in local or systemic
angiogenic factors and is followed by break-
down of endothelial basement membrane, to
facilitate endothelial cell migration and pro-
liferation.9 Binding of VEGF-A to the
endothelial-specific VEGF receptor-2

appears to be the main extracellular signal
triggering the angiogenic response.9
Research characterizing cerebrovascular
lesions has demonstrated increased expres-
sion of angiogenic factors, such as VEGF-A,
at the protein and mRNA levels.19,20 In such
lesions, normal adult cerebral vascular
growth is stopped, endothelial cell prolifer-
ation and angiogenesis are in a relatively
inhibited state and VEGF-A expression is
low.21 Such findings may indicate that in
cAVM angiogenesis is in an active state,
especially in H-AVM, and that endothelial
cell proliferation and angiogenesis are more
active, which may also explain the causes of
haemorrhage. A cAVM is a complex tangle
of abnormal arteries and veins linked by one
or more fistulae: cAVMs lack a capillary bed
and the small arteries have a deficient
muscularis layer. Such characteristics indi-
cate that abnormal arteriovenous plasticity
may be the main reason for the formation of
cAVMs.
Ephrin B2 and EphB4 have been
regarded as the primary marker molecules
for arteriovenous differentiation, with
ephrin B2 expressed exclusively by arterial
endothelial cells and EphB4 by venous
endothelial cells.8,22,23 This interpretation is
reinforced by growing but not yet conclusive
evidence that vessel marker proteins have
roles other than establishing vessel identity
in vessel sprouting (during vessel remodel-
ling and angiogenesis), such as the modula-
tion of cell signalling and the direction of
cell-tip filopodial extension.24­26 Indeed,
ephrin B2 can act as a proangiogenic
factor in postnatal neovascularization,
since it is capable of inducing neovascular-
ization when delivered in a corneal micro-
pocket assay.27
The present findings suggest extensive
and ongoing roles for EphB4 and ephrin
B2 in cAVM. We found that high ephrin B2
expression continued to mark arteries select-
ively in cAVM, but that there was no
expression in normal STA; in line with
other research discussed above,21 we postu-
late that EphB2 did not stain in STA
because these were mature, normal vessels,
whereas in cAVM EphB2 staining was
observed because the vessels were mal-
formed and/or immature. Furthermore, we
found ephrin B2 expression only in the
arterial endothelium, not in the surrounding
arterial smooth muscle cells and pericytes.
This conflicts with a report that ephrin B2
remained highly expressed in the endothe-
lium and smooth muscle of adult arterial
vessels.28 We also found that high EphB4
expression continued to mark venous

endothelium selectively in cAVM, but was
not expressed in normal STA. Together,
these findings suggest that EphB4 and
ephrin B2 might be involved, in an ongoing
fashion, in regulating vascular endothelial
formation, and arteriovenous differentiation
and plasticity. Furthermore, in our view,
selective expression of EphB4 and ephrin B2
in veins and arteries suggests that ligand­
receptor pairs can act together, leading to
abnormal angiogenesis in cAVM in the
embryo and adult.
Molecules with expression restricted to
either arterial or venous endothelial cells are
referred to as arteriovenous markers, and
play critical roles in determining the corres-
ponding endothelial cell lineages during
embryonic development.29 The expression
level of the arterial endothelial cell marker
ephrin B2 seems to be dependent on extra-
cellular determinants, as it is up-regulated
by VEGF-A and exposure to hypoxia.30,31
We speculate that hypoxia of the cerebral
regional area due to artery­vein fistulae in
cAVM stimulates VEGF-A production,
which upregulates expression of ephrin B2.
In the embryo, induction of arteriovenous-
specific marker expression occurs when
VEGF-A signals via the VEGF receptor-2/
neuropilin-1 complex in arterial-fated angio-
blasts, leading to the downstream activation
of notch and ERK signalling pathways, and
the subsequent expression of the arterial
marker ephrin B2. There is some evidence
that transcription factors can inhibit the
notch signalling pathway in veins, inducing
the expression of the venous marker
EphB4.32­36 The appropriate expression of
EphB4 and ephrin B2 has been determined
by Delta-like ligand (DLL)-1, a notch ligand
and an upstream factor regulating embry-
onic artery differentiation and postnatal
angiogenesis.37 Hainaud et al.38 found that
upregulation of notch ligand DLL4 by
VEGF-A could increase the activity of
notch 4, leading to upregulation of ephrin
B2 and downregulation of EphB4.37,38
The activation of notch 4 is necessary for
the upregulation of ephrin B2 by VEGF-A
and vascular endothelial cell differentiation.
The other notable finding of the present
study was that expression of VEGF-A,
EphB4 and ephrin B2 was higher in
H-AVM than in NH-AVM, which suggests
that endothelial cells are more active in
H-AVM than in NH-AVM.
Vascular endothelial growth factor-
induced cell signalling has been implicated
in arteriovenous specification during embry-
onic development,39 suggesting that VEGF-
A plays a role in arteriovenous specification
in adult neovascularization. However, other
studies showed that VEGF-A is not respon-
sible for angiogenic sprouting,40,41 suggest-
ing a different mechanism for the regulation
of ephrin B2 and EphB4 expression, and
arteriovenous identity specification.
Arteriovenous specification in adult neovas-
cularization may be driven by haemo-
dynamic forces and perivascular cell
activity that is associated with specific
needs of the tissue, rather than by predeter-
mined programming. To our knowledge,
haemodynamic forces are the main reasons
for haemorrhage in cerebral AVM, which
could explain the higher expression of
VEGF-A, EphB4 and ephrin B2 in H-
AVM. Hypoxia due to regional haemor-
rhage also stimulates VEGF-A production
and promotes neovascularization.42,43
In conclusion, cAVMs have long been
thought to arise from abnormal vascular
formation during embryonic development.
The course of cAVMs cannot easily be
predicted; they may remain static, grow or
regress. Neovascularization and arterioven-
ous specification are the most important
molecular events in cAVM. High expression
of EphB4 and ephrin B2 continues to mark
arteries and veins selectively in cAVM, and
plays an important role in neovasculariza-
tion and arteriovenous specification. The
notch pathway induced by VEGF-A may be
a key signalling pathway. Understanding the
412 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
molecular mechanism underlying neovascu-
larization, differentiation and arteriovenous
specification is important for the develop-
ment of future therapeutic approaches and
for the prediction of bleeding in cAVM.
Expression of VEGF-A in cAVM was the
first step that we studied. We now plan to
conduct studies with proliferation markers,
notch pathway markers and with primary
cultures defined from human specimens, to
elucidate more about this key area of clinical
research.
