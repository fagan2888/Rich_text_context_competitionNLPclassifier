Introduction
Against the backdrop of global socio-economic, political,
and environmental challenges, public sector leaders need to
prepare their organizations for positive ethical reasoning
and moral transformations geared toward check-mating
ethical dilemma and lapses. The public sector, especially
civil service as a concept connotes a permanent body of
officials responsible for the execution of programs and pol-
icies of government. There are staffs of various parastatals,
ministries, or departments under the executive arm of gov-
ernment. The concept ethics means standards of what are
right or wrong behaviors, motives and, its consequences; it
is equally a set of acceptable values and norms that relates
to human conduct regarded as appropriate or inappropriate
(Sorkaa, 2003). In the public service, achieving a private
gain to the detriment of the citizenry is a good example of
unethical conduct. Ethical reasoning is a matter of value
judgment on professional and occupational beliefs and
morality; they are the normative values underpinning the
public sector administration. Thus, these are an ethical
value that upholds the fabric of efficiency and service
delivery within the sector. Basically, effective and efficient
management of resources and accountability is a global
phenomenon, especially in a developing economy like
Nigeria, which is bedeviled by ethical decline and leader-
ship lapses.
Furthermore, the public sector administration in Nigeria
is abysmal, and engulfed in leadership crisis and moral ethi-
cal decline. These are attributed to unethical moral reasoning
and behavior of the public officials. More often than not,
some ethical lapses are the outcome of poor moral judgment,
blatant disregard for code of ethics and law, outright corrup-
tion, favoritisms, and other evil intentions of public leaders
(Kellerman, 2004), and reasons for leader's failures are as
many as the ethical lapses. Thus, unethical conduct, actions,
and porous judgment have created and nourished a leader-
ship crisis that has adversely affected the quality of gover-
nance in all spheres and levels of the public service.Anotable
Nigerian writer and a social critic (Achebe, 1983) posited
that one major problem of Nigeria is leadership failure and
its attendant consequences.
Moreover, absence of good leadership and governance
has been identified as the major setback in socio-economic
and political development efforts in the Third World coun-
tries (Kurtz & Schrank, 2007). Similarly, the inability of

Examining Ethical Reasoning and
Transformational Leadership Style in
Nigeria Public Sector
Chikelu Okey Felix1, Abd Halim B. Ahmad1, and Rosita Bint Arshad1
Abstract
A significant number of studies reported linkages between ethical moral reasoning and transformational leadership (TFL) style,
but questioned its moral foundation based on shared values and ethics. Thus, the issue of public leaders' and subordinates'
degree of moral judgment and TFL behavior as perceived by followers is explored. The Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) and
the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ X5) were completed by leaders and subordinates severely (Avolio & Bass,
2004; Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau, & Thoma, 1999). Path analysis of the structural model indicates positive significant statistical
relationship between cognitive moral development (CMD) and TFL style ( = 0.120, t = 1.286, p < .10). Nevertheless, we
indicate that the capacity to experience, discover, and anticipate ethical threats encourages the use of post-conventional stage
in decision making, and this result adds to our understanding of the relationship between ethical reasoning and leadership
style.

public sector leadership in Nigeria to live up to expectations
has resulted in the erosion of trust and confidence by the citi-
zenry. A better mechanism for restoring trust and confidence
of the populace is through ethical reasoning and moral
behavior on the part of the leadership which will enhance the
ethicality of subordinates in the work situation. Ethical issues
and lapses remain one of the most pronounced gray areas of
concern among organizational theorists and leadership schol-
ars. Leadership style and its impact on followers have been
central to our everyday life from ages.
However, leaders' "and subordinates'" degree of moral
development has attracted the attention of scholars and prac-
titioners for decades. Nowadays, credible organizations
encourage post-conventional ethical reasoning and behavior
for efficiency and effectiveness. Similarly, the increasing
nature and momentum of ethical decline and leadership fail-
ures elicits academic curiosity. Transformational leadership
(TFL) style and transactional leadership style focus on
employee relationship with leaders, which constitutes com-
plex methodological and theoretical challenges to scholars.
Moreover, the impact of individual value orientation remains
under explored, while leadership plays crucial role toward
blending man and materials for effective organizational
outcome.
In the contemporary world of today, most especially the
Nigerian public sector, leadership failure and crisis are usu-
ally attributed to lack of ethical practices and behavior among
the leaders. Equally significant is that most of the values usu-
ally linked to ethics in the public sector are always examined
independently of the broader issue of leadership (Seifert &
Yukl, 2010); in line with this, it is believed that ethic and
leadership will be an illusion, if both concepts are not
blended. Despite the important role both play in organiza-
tions, only few researches have been documented in the
Nigerian context at this time, and in particular no study
examined the influence of personal, individual value orienta-
tion on cognitive moral development (CMD) of leaders and
followers (Achebe, 1983). However, researchers on ethics
point out that individuals frequently rationalize or disagree
over the most moral action to an ethical dilemma, as an
action is morally right or wrong depends on the norms of the
society.
TFL
Literature evidenced that high ethical standards are the hall-
marks of TFL (Bass, 1998; Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999). TFL
vision and values are based on shared ideology. The impact
of transformational leadership in the public sector is being
contested as scholars maintain that the organizational struc-
ture and size of the public sector inhibits or even out rightly
makes transformational leadership unethical venture (Seifert
& Yukl, 2010), hence the rational for a moderating factor
sometimes to cushion negative impediments.Although atten-
tion has been focused on TFL due largely to its positive
effects, very little has been done to establish its processes.
Scholars have therefore made calls for more study to exam-
ine the mechanism of TFL style (Judge & Piccolo, 2006).
Previous studies supports that the features of the leader, the
followers, and situations enhances the chances for a leader to
be transformational and to exhibit such behavior (Avolio,
Reichard, Hannah, Walumbwa, & Chan, 2009; Yukl &
Mahsud, 2010). Therefore, this study seeks to investigate the
influence of CMD on TFL style and subordinates' ethicality
in the Nigerian public sector.
CMD and TFL Style
The TFL style sometimes referred to as charismatic or vision-
ary leadership exhibits higher level of moral maturity
(Conger & Kanungo, 1998; Shamir, House, & Arthur, 1993),
and it uplifts the moral behavioral standards of followers
(Burns, 1978). True transformational leaders are known to be
optimistic, committed, risk takers, strong willed in character,
and possess a great inner sense of direction and judgment
(House & Aditya, 1997; Shamir, Zakay, Breinin, & Popper,
1998), equally, empirical research related TFL to the higher
moral development (Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999; Kuhnert &
Lewis, 1987). Transformational leaders are visionaries who
empower, develop, support, create innovations, are charis-
matic, and lead by example; it has demonstrated a positive
relationship on subordinates' attitudes and organizational
outcome and impacts positively on subordinates' general
ethicality.
Post-conventional moral judgment is based on sound rea-
soning. It is an acceptable solution to an ethical dilemma or
between conflicting systems, values, beliefs which require
that a leader must make a decision to follow in achieving a
set objective. It is important to note that each decision made
by a leader is usually based on one criterion or the other;
therefore, ethical reasoning and ethical decisions sometimes
are based on more than one ethical theory or ethical princi-
ple. For example, scholars are of the view that different ethi-
cal contents will naturally invoke a different ethical reasoning
approach as in cases of coercion and control; this normally
will invoke the act utilitarianism ethical reasoning (Fritzsche
& Becker, 1984). Ethics could be regarded as a road map
which points out the difference between the right and wrong
behavior and this equally acts as a standard against which the
behavior and actions of the public officials and political
office holders can be measured. The complexities and dyna-
mism of human decisions often demand more than one the-
ory to meet the exigencies of an ethical dilemma (Felix,
Ahmad, & Arshad, 2015).
Lawrence Kohlberg (1969) remains a reference point
whenever moral judgment level is being considered, and his
theory of CMD highlights the processes of moral judgment.
Individuals move from the stages to the highest which is the
post-conventional stage; therefore, principled reasoning or
ethical reasoning is based on individual capacity to develop
Felix et al. 3
to the highest level. Individuals at the early stage occupy
themselves with what is right due largely to fear of punish-
ment (Stage 1), or exchange in relationship a sort of give and
take (Stage 2), while those on conventional level do what is
right based on expectation of others (Stage 3). By Stage 4,
individuals are principle minded and decide what is right due
to their cherished values and standards irrespective of diver-
gent views, and at Stage 5, individuals are concerned with
justice, rights, and fair play, while Stage 6 is more of a theory
than practicable as at now.
Kohlberg's theory has been simplified into a manageable
form (Rest, Narvaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 1999) while retain-
ing the core elements of the old theory. Those individuals
with a higher level of moral reasoning are admired by subor-
dinates as transformational leaders (Turner, Barling,
Epitropaki, Butcher, & Milner, 2002). From an individual
values perspective, power and achievement will attract an
observer's attention and will likely enhance the observer's
desire to emulate the modeled individual behavior. Empirical
studies that examined cognitive moral reasoning and TFL are
rare. Equally, managers with high level of ethical reasoning
were perceived as transformational leaders (Turner et
al.,
2002), leadership motivated by ethics and shared values, a
social learning process (Brown & Treviño, 2006). Therefore,
from empirical results and related theories, it is posited that
cognitive moral reasoning will positively enhance TFL
behavior to impact significantly on followers' general moral
behavior and level reasoning.
Leadership connotes exchange, expectation, and reciproc-
ity which are the hallmarks of subordinates­leadership rela-
tionship. Thus, we argue that compromising high ethical
behavior in TFL will engender such relationships, as leaders
with low or high level CMD will exhibit commensurate or
discriminating behavioral pattern. Bass (1985) empirically
analyzed TFL and developed four items of measure as pro-
pelling follower's perception of values and mission and
vision, make followers abandon personal interest for organi-
zational needs
Method
This study is a quantitative research conducted in a cross-
sectional design to examine the effect of cognitive moral
reasoning on TFL style in the Nigerian public sector. The
target populations of this study are the employees of the
Kebbi State public service, and the population frame was
obtained from the State's Civil Service Commission (2013)
Kebbi that controls the various ministries in the state. Kebbi
State is in the Northwestern part of Nigeria and it was pri-
marily selected for this study because it is one of the largest
and most populated geopolitical zones in the country with
an estimated population of about 10 million out of the total
estimated Nigerian population of 140 million; therefore,
Kebbi State represents a viable zone in Nigeria's public sec-
tor organization.
Sample and Sampling Technique
A stratified sampling method was adopted due to the diver-
sity of ministries mandate and the likely diversity equally in
style of leadership and individual belief system. The essence
is to gain more insight into the perception of employees on
leadership styles (Sekaran, 2009). Four ministries were ran-
domly selected from the 10 ministries that were not affected
by the recent mergers and equally are the core ministries with
the largest population based on statistical report (The Civil
Service Commission, 2013). The total of employees of the
four ministries is 14,337. Using the simplified sampling
table by Krejcie and Morgan (1970), a total sample size of
375 is deemed adequate for the study. However, the researcher
decided to even it up to 400, the reason is to enhance a large
response rate as Nigeria is characterized by a poor response
to survey research.
Instrumentation
A survey questionnaire was used to collect data from respon-
dents to achieve the desired objectives. This is in respect to
the nature of the formulated hypotheses in this study. For
cognitive, moral development (CMD; Rest, Narvaez, Bebeau
etal., 1999) v the DIT-2 questionnaire, which is in two parts
containing the instructions and stories of ethical, social prob-
lems, as well as questions on ethical issues raised was used,
respondents were to rate and rank most important arguments
that influenced their decisions (p score). The dimensions of
TFL style were measured using the Multifactor Leadership
Questionnaire (MLQ X5; Avolio & Bass, 2004). The instru-
ment was divided into three sections, namely, demographic
factors, ethical reasoning, and the transformational leader-
ship style. Respondents were required to answer questions
on ethical reasoning/value orientation (CMD) using a 5-point
Likert-type scale adopted from a series of ethical dilemmas/
value estimates and scenarios developed by eminent scholars
(Triandis & Gelfand, 1998).
Data Analysis
Partial Least Square­Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-
SEM) software (Ringle, Wende, & Will, 2005) was used for
the analysis of the collected data in this study. In addition,
Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used for
the descriptive analyses of the respondents. To measure the
significance of linear bivariate, between the cognitive,
moral development (CMD), and transformational leader-
ship. A regression analysis was used to meet the objective
of the research. The choice of PLS-SEM in this study is
based on the fact that PLS suits complexities of models due
largely to its flexibility in development and validation of
models. Therefore, SmartPLS 2.0 (M3) was chosen to
establish, construct, measurement and structural models in
this study.
4 SAGE Open
Measurement Model
The measurement model was evaluated by assessing the con-
vergent validity, which is measured by loading, the average
variance extracted (AVE), and the composite reliability (CR)
result. The result revealed good items loading above the rec-
ommended threshold (0.5) by Hair, Black, Babin, Anderson,
and Tatham (2014). Also, the result of the AVE indicates a
value of 0.580 for TFL style, but no value for CMD because
it was measured by a single item. Concerning the CR result
which measures the internal consistency of the measurement
instrument, the analysis found a value of 0.846 for TFL style.
The values of the CR are greater than the threshold value of
0.7 recommended by Hair etal. (2014), which indicate a
good reliable measure of the measurement instrument. In
addition, the finding revealed an R2 value of .142, indicating
that 14.2% variance in TFL style was explained by the cogni-
tive moral reasoning (CMD). The summary of the measure-
ment model in this study is presented in Table 1.
In this study, SmartPLS 2.0 software from Ringle et
al.
(2005) was used for the model parameter estimation to enhance
the maximization of the variance in TFL explained by CMD.
Hence, the study used a non-parametric method with 2,000
bootstrappedsamplestoestimatethestandarderrors(Tenenhaus,
Vinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro, 2005). The next section presents the
assessment of the measurement model of the study.
Discriminant Validity
The discriminant validity indicates whether the concept
under investigation in a study is unique in a model (Hair,
Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2013). Applying the Fornel and Lackers
criterion, achieved by comparing the square root of the aver-
age variance extracted values with the correlation values of
each latent variable in the model (Fornell & Larcker, 1981),
the result shows that the AVE value of each construct is
greater than its highest correlation with any other constructs
in the model, which thereby indicates the achievement of
discriminant validity (Hair etal., 2014). Table 2 presents the
result of the discriminant validity.
Structural Model
Structural model captures the linear regression effects endog-
enous constructs on each other and the structural model gives
an insight into the relationships of the constructs. An innova-
tive and evolving model in its ability to test directly theories
of interest (Li & Wong, 2001) and its validation was done
through the application of the SmartPLS 2.0.M3.
Findings
Empirical results of previous studies are inconsistent largely
due to factor optimal structure which requires further confir-
matory analysis. The analysis of the demographic profile of
the respondents revealed that the largest proportion represent-
ing 79% of the respondents are from the ministry of education.
The major percentage, 27.7% have between 6 and 10 years
working experience, 22.5% have between 1 and 5 years work-
ing experience, 26.3% have between 11 and 15 years of work-
ing experience, and only 23.5% of the respondents have more
than 16 years of working experience. In addition, 56.5% of the
respondents are male, while 43.5% are female. Moreover, the
majority of the respondents are Muslims, 47.4%; 39.6% are
Christians; and 13.0% are in the group of other religions.
Concerning the age of the respondents, 26.3% are between 30
and 39 years, 27.0% are between 20 and 29 years of age, 26.7%
are between 40 and 49 years of age, while 20.0% are more than
50 years of age. Furthermore, 22.5% of the respondents are
senior executive officers of their respective organizations,
17.9% are chief executive officers, and 26.3% are supervisors,
while the remaining 33.3% are at a non-supervisory grade posi-
tion. In the aspect of the respondents'educational qualification,
15.4% of the respondents have master's degree, 25.6% have a
bachelor's degree, and 12.3% are doctoral degree holders,
while the remaining 22.8 have diploma and 23.9% have a
higher school qualifications. The results of the demographic
analysis are presented in Table 3.

This study used Defining Issues Test (DIT-2) by Rest,
Narvaez, Bebeau etal., (1999), which focuses the schema
used by individuals in solving ethical issues and which deter-
mines the respondent's stage of moral reasoning. The result
shows that the major proportion, 65.61%, of the respondents
are at the preconvention stage of moral reasoning and 20%
are at the conventional stage, while 14.39% are at the post-
conventional stage of moral reasoning. Table 4 presents the
summary of the moral reasoning level of the respondents.
Research Question 2: To what extent does CMD relate to
TFL style in the Nigerian public sector?
In testing the stated research questions of this study, the
structural model was assessed through the PLS path analysis.
Table 5 shows the result of the standard path coefficients (),
standard error, t value, and the decision taken on the hypoth-
eses. The result found a statistical significant relationship
between CMD and TFL style ( = 0.239, t = 4.072, p < .014).
Research Question 3: What is the level of CMD and TFL
in the various ministries?
Table 6 depicts the mean value and the standard devia-
tion of TFL style in the various ministries understudy in
respect to post-conventional reasoning application to
solve ethical dilemmas in the workplace. As observed,
the ministry of finance with 3.26 mean value, has an
edge, followed by the ministry of health 3.24 mean value,
then the ministry of works and housing 3.20 and the least
is the ministry of education 3.12 mean value in that order.
The reason could be attributed to the fact that the ministry
of works and housing seems to be business orientated as
contingent reward manifests in the day-to-day allocations
of duties and responsibilities, while the ministry of edu-
cation relies more on prescribed rules and curriculum,
unlike the ministries of health and finance where their
ethical code of conduct is more pronounced and ser-
vice oriented.
Discussion
The motive behind this study was to examine the degree of
public sector officials' CMD and its relationship with TFL
behavior as perceived by the subordinates. We proposed that
CMD is related to TFL style as perceived by the subordinates
and it was significantly supported as leaders operating at a

higher stage of moral reasoning will exhibit more TFL
behavior. Idealized influence attracts respect and admiration
of subordinates, demonstrate the features of a moral individ-
ual and moral leadership (Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999). It
instills respect and trust on followers. Inspirational motiva-
tion compels transformational leaders reflect on moral caring
attitude and sincere interest in the development of their fol-
lowers as they lead by example, acceptable to the subordi-
nates who equally emulate them. While through intellectual
stimulation and individualized consideration, transforma-
tional leaders appreciate the subordinates'personal attributes
and potentials with regard to their individual requirements
and aspirations.
These findings seem predictive, as transformational
leaders motivate and mentor their subordinates for self and
organizational benefits, and this is direct opposite of trans-
actional leadership which is more assertive and perfor-
mance oriented. Leaders with low level moral reasoning
stage exhibit less transformational leadership qualities,
while those in the middle (Conventional Stage) apply either
pre-conventional or post-conventional reasoning, and this
supports earlier theorists (e.g., Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999;
Kimberling, 2008; Kuhnert & Lewis, 1987; Turner etal.,
2002). Therefore, our argument is that public leaders with
higher CMD exhibit more TFL behaviors, and impact more
positively on subordinates' general ethical make-up and
moral behavior. Transactional leadership behavior is more
in use between subordinate-leaders relations in the Nigeria
public sector.
Conclusion
We gave an insight to further buttress current knowledge
about CMD and TFL behavior and advocated an agenda for
further studies. Leaders exhibiting post-conventional moral
reasoning are inclined to use TFL behavior and are perceived
as such by the subordinates (Trevino, 1986; Turner etal.,
2002). Ethical reasoning is not the only barometer to mea-
sure moral development as they are varieties of models
(Chen McCain, Tsai, & Bellino, 2010). This adds value and
increased our understanding of both concepts as it will guide
leadership training tailor measured to suit the realities on the
ground. Therefore, further studies are advocated to investi-
gate other intervening elements as other individual moral
motivational values and TFL behavior. Similarly, an insight
into other mechanisms will spur future studies. The research
reveals that ethical reasoning correlates to TFL style, which
enhances ethicality of followers and the organization. Thus,
this research work maintains and concludes that the findings
have been able to address the research questions and the
study's objectives.
