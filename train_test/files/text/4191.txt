and gingivitis within the
dental arches

Abstract
Objective: The natural accumulation of supragingival plaque on surfaces of human teeth is
associated with gingival inflammation and the initiation of common oral diseases. This study
evaluated the distribution of dental plaque and gingivitis scores within the dental arches after
prophylaxis.
Methods: Adult subjects from the Dharwad, India area representing the general population who
provided written informed consent were scheduled for screening. Healthy subjects over the age of
18 years, not currently requiring any medical or dental care, and presenting with a complement of
at least 20 natural teeth were recruited for this parallel design study. Enrolled subjects (n ¼ 41)
underwent oral examinations for dental plaque (PI) and gingivitis (GI) using the Turesky
modification of the Quigley-Hein and the Lo
¨e-Silness Index, respectively, at the baseline visit,
followed by a whole mouth dental prophylaxis. Subjects were given fluoride toothpaste for twice
daily oral hygiene for the next 30 days. Subjects were recalled on days 15 and 30 for PI and GI
examinations identical to baseline.
Results: Analyses indicated that mean scores for PI and GI on either arch and the whole mouth
were higher than 2 and 1, respectively, during all examinations. Anterior surfaces consistently
exhibited lower PI scores than posterior regions of either arch, or the entire dentition. Regional GI
differences within the dentition were similar to PI scores, with lower scores on anterior than
posterior teeth. Prophylaxis reduced both the frequency and mean scores of both PI and GI,
irrespective of arch, with lower scores observed on anterior than posterior regions during all
recall visits. Molar and lingual regions consistently exhibited higher PI and GI scores compared with
anterior surfaces. At all examinations, mean scores for both plaque and gingivitis were higher on
approximal vestibular than mid-vestibular surfaces.
Conclusions: Differences observed in PI and GI within the dentition have several practical
implications: (a) there are advantages of whole mouth assessments for oral health (b) a need for
oral hygiene formulations to reduce the larger deposits of dental plaque in the posterior region and
resultant gingival inflammation, and (c) a requirement for ongoing oral hygiene education.

Background
Endogenous organisms of the human mouth
readily colonize exposed surfaces of the den-
tition to form dental plaque, a natural
microbial biofilm.1­3 Clinical studies in con-
junction with microbiological analyses
have evaluated the role of dental plaque
in the initiation and progression of gingival
inflammation and other oral diseases.2 These
assessments have been instrumental in iden-
tifying the organisms associated with caries,
gingivitis and periodontal disease.3,4 Based
on the available evidence, current practices
typically emphasize optimal plaque control
for maintaining oral health.1,4 Home-use
plaque control measures comprise the most
common means for routine plaque control.
Benefits of plaque control include an oppor-
tunity to maintain a functional dentition and
prevent the onset and progression of dental
diseases. In addition, plaque control has
several aesthetic benefits, including dental
appearance and fresh breath.1
Recognition of the integral role of den-
tal plaque in the progression of oral
diseases has led to evaluations of dental
plaque accumulations within the dentition.1­5
A number of studies have examined
plaque accumulation within the dentition.
Taken together, these reports indicate that
most individuals have a repeatable pattern
of plaque accumulation within the denti-
tion5 with some areas tending to harbor
low or high amounts of plaque. Additional
research has elaborated on the influences
of other factors, including diet,6 local
oxygen tension,7 salivary factors8 and
tooth position,9 all of which influence
dental plaque accumulation. Other
variables influencing plaque accumulation
include habits and oral hygiene practices.10
Although previous studies have examined
the prevalence of plaque on the dentition, to
our knowledge there have been no investiga-
tions of the distribution of dental plaque and
gingivitis within the dental arches. The cur-
rent study focused on evaluation of individual
plaque scores and gingivitis frequencies
within each arch, as well as providing discus-
sion of previously published results.11
Determinations of plaque and gingival
scores in these distinct regions may have
practical implications for the field, such as
oral health examination practices or in clinical
evaluations of specific treatments.12
Materials and methods
Subjects
This single site clinical study was con-
ducted after the clinical protocol and
informed consent forms were reviewed
and approved by the institutional ethical
review board at SDM College of Dental
Sciences and Hospital, Dharwad, India.
Adult subjects (18­70 years of age) from
the local area who called the dental clinic
in response to word-of-mouth and adver-
tisement campaigns were scheduled for a
pre-screening visit. During the pre-screen-
ing visit, study details were explained to
prospective subjects. Subjects who pro-
vided voluntary written informed consent,
indicated availability during the study dur-
ation and were able to comply with study
procedures were scheduled for a screening
visit that included an oral examination by
a dentist. Enrolment criteria included avail-
ability for the entire duration of the study,
1586 Journal of International Medical Research 45(5)
good oral and systemic health with no
signs of neglect. Exclusion criteria included
cognitive disorders or chronic medical
conditions, systemic conditions of the
heart, kidneys, liver, or infectious diseases,
including AIDS. Other exclusion criteria
included self-reported pregnancy or lacta-
tion, drug or alcohol addition, and subjects
with crowns, veneers, dentures or other
chronic conditions including caries, peri-
odontal disease or on prescription
medications.
Study procedures
Enrolled subjects were scheduled for a
baseline visit that included a whole
mouth examination for dental plaque and
gingivitis that excluded the third molars (as
described in section below). A dentist
provided each subject with a whole
mouth prophylaxis followed by a disclos-
ing episode to ensure removal of all dental
plaque. Subjects were provided with a
commercially available fluoride toothpaste
(Colgate Dental Cream, Great Regular
Flavor, New York, NY) and a soft-bristled
toothbrush and instructed to brush twice
daily. Following enrolment, subjects were
instructed not to alter their daily diet or
other habits, but were instructed to dis-
continue the use of all other dentifrices,
mouthwashes, chewing gum and other oral
hygiene formulations for the study dur-
ation. Subjects were recalled after 15 and
30 days of dentifrice use for clinical assess-
ments that were identical to those during
the baseline visit. Study personnel con-
ducted follow-up telephone calls for sub-
jects approximately every 10 days over the
study duration. Follow-up over study dur-
ation was designed to address study-related
questions and reinforce the subjects' adher-
ence to study procedures and schedules.
All subjects completed the study without
adverse events.
Clinical scoring procedures
Clinical examinations for dental plaque and
gingivitis were conducted under constant
lighting conditions and included assessments
for dental plaque and gingivitis using the
Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein
(TMQH)13 and the Lo
¨ e-Silness [LS]14 indi-
ces, respectively. Sites examined for dental
plaque (PI) were also examined for gingivitis
(GI) with gingivitis assessments preceding the
dental plaque examination. One clinical
examiner conducted all examinations for
this study. PI and GI scores from each
tooth were recorded in appropriate forms
and subsequently compiled in Microsoft
Excel for statistical analysis.
Statistical methods
Sample size determinations were based on an
standard deviation (SD) for the response
measure with a significance level of a ¼ 0.05
at an 80% level of power. Sample size
calculations utilized historical data from
previous studies to detect differences in
clinical scores of 0.5 or less. Clinical scores
for dental plaque and gingivitis from the
entire mouth were compiled and analysed
separately. Initial analyses included descrip-
tive statistics for whole mouth scores from
each plaque and gingivitis examination
along with frequency distributions for each
score. Additionally, plaque and gingival
scores from the facial surfaces of the anterior
teeth (6­11 and 22­27) and surfaces of
posterior teeth (2­5, 12­15, 18­21, and 28­
31) at each assessment were compiled for
frequency distributions. Clinical scores were
averaged by subjects in a two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) including subjects and
time (baseline, day 15 and day 30) as main
effects. Statistically significant effects
(p < 0.05) were further analysed using post-
hoc Tukey's multiple comparison tests for
pairwise differences among time points.

Paired t-tests compared results between dif-
ferent regions of the dentition at each assess-
ment. Analyses were conducted using Minitab
(Minitab Inc., State College PA), and statis-
tical significance was determined with a 95%
confidence interval and p-value less than 0.05.
Results
Frequency distribution of PI scores
on the upper and lower arches
Results from 41 adults (23 males and 18
females; age range 19­44 years) representing
6,756 surfaces examined at each clinical
examination and their corresponding
arches subsequently during the day 15 and
30 assessments are shown in Graph 1. On a
percentage basis, surfaces with plaque scores
of 2 and 3 were the most frequent, while
those with scores of 0 and 5 were the least
frequent. At each evaluation, less than 13%
of the sites reported a plaque score of 4. A
score of 5 was observed in approximately
4% of the surfaces at baseline, while less
than 2% of the surfaces exhibited a score of
5 in evaluations following prophylaxis.
Comparison of mean PI scores on
anterior and posterior surfaces
from either arch
Table 1 shows the least squares mean scores
for plaque on the anterior and posterior
surfaces from each arch. Plaque scores
were 2 or more at each evaluation, irrespect-
ive of arch. ANOVA revealed significant
reductions from baseline to day 15 eva-
luations for the lower anterior and upper
posterior surfaces of both arches (p < 0.05),
reflecting the effects of prophylaxis.
Irrespective of location, day 30 plaque
scores corresponded with baseline scores.
Statistical comparisons of mean differ-
ences in plaque between the anterior and
posterior regions of each arch over the study
period are shown in Table 2. Regardless of
arch, significantly higher mean PI scores
were observed among posterior surfaces
compared with anterior regions (p < 0.003).
Prophylaxis reduced plaque scores from
baseline to the first recall visit but demon-
strated consistent increases from the first to
the second recall visit. Mean scores from the
second recall visit were similar to those
observed at baseline.
Plaque scores within each region
of the dentition
Mean plaque scores within each region of
the dentition are shown in Table 3. At each
evaluation, mean plaque scores for each
region were greater than 2. All surfaces
demonstrated reductions from baseline to
the day 15 evaluation. These effects were
statistically significant (p < 0.05) with the
exception of the mid-vestibular surfaces

(p > 0.05). An increase in plaque scores was
observed for all surfaces from the day 15 to
the day 30 evaluation (p < 0.05). With the
exception of molar surfaces, there were no
significant differences in plaque scores for
any surface between baseline and the day 30
evaluations (p < 0.05). Mid-vestibular and
molar regions consistently reported the
lowest and highest scores at each evaluation,
respectively (p < 0.0000). Additional ana-
lyses indicated significantly lower mean

with approximal surfaces at each evaluation
(p 0.0001).

Frequency distribution of GI scores
on the upper and lower arches
Graph 2 shows the frequency of each GI score
on the upper and lower arches in relation to
the entire dentition. Gingival scores of 1 and 2
were most common at the baseline evalu-
ation. On a percentage basis, a gingival score
of 2 was more frequent on the posterior
surfaces of the lower arch than on the upper
arch at baseline. A gingival score of 3 was
found on 8.4­10.19% of the surfaces, and
fewer than 1.5% of the surfaces were devoid
of gingivitis. Prophylaxis reduced the number
of surfaces reporting gingival scores of 2 and 3
with a concomitant increase in the number of
sites reporting scores of 0 and 1. We observed
reductions in gingival scores of surfaces in the
two recall visits, with a score of 1 found at
more than 69% of the sites, constituting the
most frequent observation. At the first recall
visit, 6.6­8.6% of the sites exhibited a score of
0, and less than 1% of surfaces reported a
score of 3 with comparable observations
during the final recall examination.
Irrespective of arch, sites with a score of 3
were observed at less than 1% of all sites in
both recall visits.
Comparisons of mean GI scores on
anterior and posterior surfaces
from either arch
Table 4 shows the least squares mean GI
scores on the anterior and posterior surfaces
from each arch. Mean scores irrespective of
arch were 1 or more at each evaluation. by
ANOVA revealed significant reductions
from baseline to the day 15 evaluations for
all evaluated arches and surfaces (p < 0.05).
Irrespective of location, day 30 GI scores
indicated additional reductions from the day
15 scores.
Table 5 shows the mean GI scores on
anterior and posterior surfaces from either
arch. On the upper arch, anterior surfaces
demonstrated significantly lower mean GI
scores than the corresponding posterior
surfaces (p < 0.05). Although there were
significant differences between the anterior
and posterior regions of the lower arch at
the two recall visits (p < 0.001), no differ-
ences were observed between these surfaces
at baseline (p ¼ 0.7641).
Mean gingival scores within each region
of the dentition
Table 6 shows the mean gingival scores
within each region of the dentition over the
study period. At each evaluation, mean
scores from each region were higher
than 1, with the exception of mid-vestibular
and mid-lingual regions during the recall
visits. Surfaces demonstrated significant
reductions in gingival scores from base-
line to both recall visits (p < 0.05).
Mid-vestibular and mid-lingual regions
constituted the regions with the lowest
scores compared with molar regions that

tended to exhibit higher scores compared
with other teeth. The statistical analyses

tracing these practices to antiquity. Whereas
natural methods of oral hygiene continue to
be utilized in different regions of the world,
the use of a toothbrush and toothpaste
represents a common approach.12 While all
Americans claim to own a toothbrush, and
brush their teeth routinely, it is clear that
most individuals fail to perform adequate
oral hygiene on a routine basis. Studies
indicate that &40­50% of plaque remains
after a brushing episode, and the effects of
plaque are represented in the widespread
prevalence of common oral diseases, includ-
ing caries, gingivitis and periodontal
disease.1,5
The current study focused on a compari-
son of dental plaque and gingivitis within
the dental arches. We evaluated subjects
using two widely utilized clinical indices for
dental plaque and gingivitis. These indices
represent the ``gold-standard'' evaluation
methods, and are commonly utilized to
assess oral health and the effects of oral
hygiene formulations.13­20 Several advan-
tages of these methods include their relative
ease, history of use, and the large number of
clinical investigators possessing practical
experience with these methods.
Several steps were included in the study
design to maintain generalizability of the
current results. Clinical procedures and
assessments were standardized for this
investigation, and a calibrated clinical exam-
iner with greater than 90% reliability for
each clinical index conducted all examin-
ations under constant lighting conditions.
The clinical indices were used to examine six
surfaces of all teeth, providing a compre-
hensive assessment of dental plaque and
gingivitis in all examinations. Prospective
subjects were screened for general health
parameters and oral health. Adults from the
general population in good health, with at
least 20 natural teeth and no crowns or
dentures, and currently not undergoing
medical or dental treatments were enrolled.
These design features were included to
reduce physiological factors that influence
the oral parameters, including dental plaque
and gingivitis, that were the primary focus
of this investigation. Several additional fea-
tures were included in the study design to
maintain the overall generalizability of the
study. Subjects were not instructed to alter
their diet or habits, to reduce the influence of
these variables on the parameters we eval-
uated.21 A new toothbrush and a commer-
cially available fluoride toothpaste were
issued to all subjects for standardized oral
hygiene during the study. Subjects were

instructed to brush their teeth as per their
usual techniques. Evaluation of 41 subjects
resulted in the evaluation of 6,756 sites for
dental plaque and gingivitis at each exam-
ination. Results from 20,268 data points
for each clinical index were compiled, com-
prising a substantial data set for statistical
analysis.
The most frequent plaque and gingival
scores on either arch were 2, 3 and 1, 2
respectively. All remaining scores were
observed on a smaller number of surfaces.
Irrespective of arch, anterior surfaces
demonstrated lower frequencies than pos-
terior regions in all evaluations. Analyses of
mean scores for both plaque and gingivitis
on the anterior and posterior surfaces of
either arch correspond to their respective
frequency distributions, with significantly
lower scores on anterior surfaces than pos-
terior regions. For both clinical parameters,
lower scores were consistently observed on
anterior regions compared with the corres-
ponding posterior sites. These results are
in accord with previous studies examining
the efficacy of oral hygiene, demonstrating
that many more anterior surfaces were
free of plaque than posterior regions.10,22
Correspondingly, results from epidemio-
logical studies indicate that posterior sites
are prone to gingival inflammation and
periodontal disease.10 While the current
results are in congruence with previous
reports in the literature, they are in contrast
with assessments of oral health provided by
analyses of selected regions, such as the
anterior teeth.23 Thus, analyses of anterior
surfaces appear to provide partial assess-
ments of oral hygiene based on the consist-
ently higher accumulations of dental plaque
and resultant gingival inflammation in the
posterior regions, irrespective of arch.
Anatomical and physiological features
are likely contribute to the consistent abun-
dance of dental plaque and corresponding
gingival scores in molar and lingual regions.
These surfaces are reported to consistently
exhibit the largest amounts of plaque, and
correspond to lower plaque removal from
these regions10,22 and higher susceptibility to
gingivitis10 in adults. Similar observations
have been reported among teenagers24 and
after professional tooth cleaning.19 These
clinical observations have been substantiated
by recent microbiological investigations
reporting greater amounts of microbial
DNA on posterior teeth.9
Mid-vestibular regions consistently
exhibited significantly lower scores than
approximal vestibular surfaces. These obser-
vations are relevant for oral health examin-
ations in several ways. For example, while

common indices remain the most wide-
spread means of assessing oral health,
some reports have highlighted specific defi-
ciencies in these methods.25 Approaches that
attempt to improve on these methods
include planimetric methods26 and other
techniques for examining dental plaque
on anterior teeth using digital plaque ima-
ging.23 The current results demonstrate
specific differences between and within
the dentition for dental plaque and gin-
givitis. Additionally, the current results
revealed that plaque levels on the facial
surfaces of anterior teeth did not match the
levels in approximal vestibular regions.
Taken together, these findings suggest that
anterior teeth are an insufficient substitute
for accurately evaluating whole mouth
plaque and gingivitis status.
The effect of prophylaxis was evident on
all surfaces showing reductions in plaque
and gingival scores from the baseline to the
first recall visit. All surfaces exhibited
increases in plaque scores from the first
to the second recall visit, with no signifi-
cant differences observed between the base-
line and the second recall visit. In contrast,
gingival scores maintained their broad
reductions from the first to the second
recall visit at the conclusion of the study.
These results are in accord with those of a
previous investigation examining the effects
of prophylaxis on dental plaque and bleed-
ing on probing (BOP) amongst a sample of
15 14­19-year-old male subjects.27 In that
study, significantly lower plaque levels were
observed 15 days after prophylaxis along
with reductions in BOP, however, both
plaque and BOP levels demonstrated
increases from day 15 to day 30. Subjects
enrolled in this investigation were older than
18 years, and of mixed gender. Plaque scores
on day 30 returned to baseline levels.
However, gingival scores maintained broad
reductions, revealing a divergence between
these parameters. Taken together, these
observations corroborate previous studies
and expand on the available literature,
demonstrating consistently lower PI and
GI scores on anterior surfaces compared
with posterior regions.
Conclusions
We found that PI and GI scores were lower
on anterior teeth compared with posterior
regions, irrespective of arch, in all evalu-
ations over the study period. While dental
prophylaxis reduced dental plaque and gin-
givitis scores at the day 15 and day 30
evaluations, posterior surfaces consistently
registered higher scores than anterior
regions. In addition to providing a reference
point for the distribution of plaque and
gingival inflammation on the dental arches,
the current findings have practical relevance
for oral hygiene, including the development
of preventative programs that seek to reduce
the incidence of common oral diseases.
Correspondingly, an accurate assessment
of oral health requires the incorporation of
these regional differences in whole mouth
examinations.
