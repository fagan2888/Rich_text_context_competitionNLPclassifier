Abstract: Evolutionary psychology has provoked controversy, especially when applied to
human sex differences. We hypothesize that this is partly due to misunderstandings of
evolutionary psychology that are perpetuated by undergraduate sex and gender textbooks.
As an initial test of this hypothesis, we develop a catalog of eight types of errors and
document their occurrence in 15 widely used sex and gender textbooks. Consistent with our
hypothesis, of the 12 textbooks that discussed evolutionary psychology, all contained at
least one error, and the median number of errors was five. The most common types of
errors were Straw Man, Biological Determinism, and Species Selection. We
conclude by suggesting improvements to undergraduate sex and gender textbooks.

Introduction
Evolutionary psychology (EP) is a theoretical perspective that applies evolutionary
principles to the study of human behavior. Although EP has yielded many theoretical
advances and empirical discoveries, it has provoked resistance from some scholars in the
social sciences (Confer et al., 2010; Laland and Brown, 2011). This resistance is especially
evident when EP is applied to sex and gender differences, but this application is an
inevitable extension of powerful theories that were developed by evolutionary biologists
(Vandermassen, 2005). Darwin (1871), for example, initially proposed the theory of sexual
selection to explain a persistent pattern of sex differences that he and others observed
across the animal kingdom. Sexual selection has since been elaborated and shown to be
vital for understanding sex differences in many species, including humans (Andersson,
1994; Geary, 2010).

Despite success in explaining cognitive, behavioral, and morphological sex
differences in many species, evolutionary theory remains controversial when applied to
humans and continues to provoke hostility (Geher and Gambacorta, 2010; Segreståle, 2000;
Vandermassen, 2005). Because this controversy has been broadcast to the public in often
sensationalist accounts, it might appear more vitriolic than it really is (Kurzban, 2010). The
preponderance of complaints and attacks on EP come from scholars outside of the field and
are frequently based on misunderstandings of evolution itself or how it is applied to
humans (Vandermassen, 2005). Concerned scholars have attempted to correct these
misunderstandings and simplistic media portrayals and to build bridges with scholars from
other disciplines (e.g., Buss and Schmitt, 2011; Confer et al., 2010). However, many of
these corrections and clarifications are published in academic journals that are read by few
undergraduates. By contrast, textbooks are a crucial component of an undergraduate`s
education and are an important conduit of the ideas and data that comprise a paradigm of
research (Griggs, Jackson, Christopher, and Marek, 1999). Previous research indicates that
textbook accounts of EP are frequently inaccurate (see Previous Textbook Studies section
for references), and there apparently has been little effort devoted to improving textbook
accuracy.
In this article, we assess the presentation of EP in 15 textbooks on sex and gender.
We focus on sex and gender textbooks for three reasons. First, as explained above,
evolutionary theory is well suited to contribute to the understanding of sex differences and
similarities (Geary, 2010). Second, many sex and gender studies scholars appear skeptical
about the merits of EP (Buss and Schmitt, 2011; Vandermassen, 2005). Third, to our
knowledge, researchers have not examined the accuracy of sex and gender textbook
presentations of EP. Before presenting our coding methodology and results, we briefly
investigate potential reasons for mistrust and hostility toward EP among sex and gender
studies scholars and review previous presentations of evolutionary psychology in
textbooks.
Reasons for Mistrust and Lack of Acceptance
The idea that human nature--including differences between the sexes--is
biologically influenced was once relatively standard, indeed, taken for granted by most
social scientists (Degler, 1991). In the early 1900`s, however, a number of scholars,
influenced by the incipient disciplines of cultural anthropology and behaviorism, began to
question this assumption. The gradual revelation of the crimes committed by the Nazis
alarmed the public and academics alike and further promoted concerns about the social and
political implications of biological approaches to human nature (Laland and Brown, 2011).
These concerns and skepticism have persisted, to some degree, as protection against what
some scholars view as an attempt to justify inequitable social policies and institutions
(Lopreato and Crippen, 1999; Lord and Sanderson, 1999). That is, biologically based views
of human nature are, within certain academic communities, seen as a form of apologetics
for an unjust social system and for myriad other social evils (e.g., sexism, racism,
classism). This seems especially true for broadly liberal disciplines that aspire actively to
ameliorate social suffering (Geher and Gambacorta, 2010).
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -476-
However, recent research has shown that, despite popular assumptions, liberalism
does not predict a rejection of applying evolutionary theory to humans (Perry and Mace,
2010). Furthermore, from the imperfect data we possess, EPs appear no more likely to
adhere to conservative political beliefs than other social scientists (Tybur, Miller, and
Gangestad, 2007). Therefore, political ideology, although a probable source of some
hostility toward EP, is not a powerful predictor of a scholar`s willingness to apply EP to
human behavior.
Evidence indicates that, in fact, a misunderstanding of the basic principles of EP is a
more powerful predictor of hostility toward it than is political ideology (Perry and Mace,
2010). A student, for example, who is taught that EP ignores the importance of culture
might understandably develop a skeptical, perhaps even hostile, attitude toward EP. A
similar problem led to hostility toward behaviorism, especially as propounded by B.F.
Skinner. Students were taught that Skinner eschewed instincts altogether and that he
completely ignored internal processes (Jensen and Burgess, 1997). Instincts and internal
processes quite clearly exist, so this led to dismissals of Skinner and accusations that his
framework was entirely wrong (in fact, embarrassingly so). These errors were included in
textbooks and propagated to the next generation of students, who continued to reject
Skinnerism (DeBell and Harless, 1992). We suggest that a similar process involving sex
and gender textbooks may explain some of the hostility toward EP. Thus, a combination of
liberal ideology and broad misunderstanding of the content of EP may combine to lead sex
and gender scholars to view EP as a conservative and wrongheaded approach to explaining
human sex differences.
As a first step in testing our hypothesis that a cycle of ignorance contributes to the
hostility directed toward EP, we coded its presentation in sex and gender textbooks. We
predict that presentations of EP will be frequently inaccurate.
It is important to note that sex and gender scholars and sociologists probably hold a
more negative view of EP and have more misconceptions than scholars in many areas of
psychology (e.g., cognitive scientists, developmentalists, neuroscientists, linguists, etc.)
(Geher and Gambacorta, 2010; Lopreato and Crippen, 1999; Perry and Mace, 2010). Many
psychologists who do not identify as EPs have fully integrated the Darwinian revolution
into their research and possess an acute knowledge of evolution and natural and sexual
selection.
Previous Textbook Studies
To our knowledge, five previous studies have examined presentations of EP in
undergraduate textbooks. All found that EP presentations were flawed, inaccurate, or, more
rarely, hostile. Cornwell, Palmer, Guinther, and Davis (2005) reported that almost 80% of
39 introductory psychology textbooks (years 2000-2004) presented EP inaccurately, and
roughly 30% were negative toward EP. Martin and Machaleck (2006) found that 69% of
introductory sociology textbooks covered EP in any way, and the ones that did frequently
contained errors. Some of the most common errors were claims that EPs adhere to genetic
determinism or biological reductionism. Park (2007) studied 10 social psychology
textbooks and found that all contained at least one mistaken representation of kin selection,
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -477-
a foundational theory for evolutionary approaches to cooperation. Chrisler and Erchull
(2011) examined 16 social psychology textbooks and found that none presented EP
uncritically, concluding that, The most common critique of evolutionary theory seems to
be to tell students that cognition and culture can override biological tendencies or that
culture restrains or limits biological tendencies (p. 756). Last, Leahy (2012) found that
sociology textbooks tend to reject explicit theories of human nature, including EP, as
biological and therefore incompatible with the plasticity of human behavior.
Our study extends these previous ones in several ways. First, our study focuses
exclusively on sex and gender textbooks. Second, we present a well-defined and explicit
catalog of errors pertaining to the presentation of evolutionary theory; previous studies
generally did not define the errors they were coding (but see Park, 2007). Third, we provide
full documentation for every error we coded so that our procedure and claims are fully
transparent.
Materials and Methods
Selecting textbooks
We began identifying social science textbooks that focus on sex and/or gender by
contacting Monument Information Resource (MIR), a company that compiles information
on undergraduate textbook usage in the United States. MIR provided us with separate
databases for a sample of psychology (n = 1,200) and sociology (n = 1,484) courses taught
in the U.S. during 2007 with titles similar to Sex and Gender, Women`s Studies, and
Human Sexuality.1 For each course, information was provided on the institution where
the course was taught, the course title, the instructor, the expected enrollment, and any
required or recommended books. For both psychology and sociology databases, we sorted
the books by title and used online resources, such as reviews and publisher`s descriptions,
to initially identify introductory textbooks to sex and gender that were broad in scope,
including discussions of both social and biological factors that influence gender-
differentiated behavior. We excluded textbooks published prior to 2005, edited volumes,
encyclopedias, readers or article compilations, specialized academic books (e.g., on sexual
violence, human sexuality, gender and aging, gender and religiosity, gender and math,
gender and labor markets, gender and group processes), and non-academic books (e.g.,
those marketed toward parents or lay audiences). These categories of books were excluded
to 1) keep our sample manageable and 2) because undergraduate textbooks form the core of
most undergraduate classes (Griggs et al., 1999) and, therefore, are most informative in
gauging the mainstream view of the discipline. In cases where it was unclear if a book was
appropriate, we obtained it and collectively made a judgment.
1
MIR used Human Sexuality as a key research term when providing data about classes on sex and gender
and textbook usage. However, we were interested in introductory textbooks on sex and gender and thus
excluded specialized textbooks on human sexuality. Some courses with course titles similar to Human
Sexuality served as introductory courses to sex and gender in general whereas others were more specialized.
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -478-
We obtained the 15 textbooks (six sociology; nine psychology) that were used in
more than one course in the MIR database and met our criteria for inclusion. At least one of
these six sociology textbooks was used in 712 of 1,484 sociology courses (48%); the most
widely used book was used in 326 courses (22%), and the least widely was used in 15
courses (1%). At least one of these nine psychology textbooks was used in 552 of 1,200
psychology courses (46%); the most widely used book was used in 124 courses (10%), and
the least widely was used in 21 courses (2%). See references for the number of courses that
used each textbook.
Identifying relevant pages
To find the pages in the textbooks that covered EP, we searched the index for three
key phrases (evolutionary theory, evolutionary psychology, and sociobiology). We summed
the pages and checked each page thoroughly for the errors listed in our catalog.
Developing the error catalog
We identified types of errors by reading previous textbook analyses, evolutionary
psychology textbooks, and introductory sex and gender textbooks. We identified eight
major types of errors, each of which is discussed in the catalog below. We note our error
catalog, like any other, is somewhat arbitrary. However, the errors listed in our catalog
were selected because EPs themselves have addressed them, sometimes repeatedly. We
also note that the Straw Man category is something of a catch all category which includes
Biological Determinism, Naturalistic Fallacy, Political Agenda, and the Intentionalistic
Fallacy. That said, there were several egregious misrepresentations that simply did not fit in
these categories and we felt these deserved to be made explicit and rebutted. Therefore, our
Straw Man (not otherwise specified) category includes straw man arguments that are not
captured by the other error types. The Appendix also corrects a few errors that were not
formally coded for analysis. We encourage other scholars to code textbooks using different
or expanded error catalogs.
Identifying errors
The first author initially coded errors by occurrence and type. He then directed the
second author to each passage containing an apparent error, and the second author
independently classified it according to error type. They agreed in 87% of cases (Cohen`s 
= .85), and disagreements were resolved by discussion.
The error catalog
Below is a list of the eight types of errors we coded with an explanation, rebuttal,
and textbook example of each. E#) denotes the type of error and R#) provides a rebuttal of
the error. Note that four of these errors--Biological Determinism, Naturalistic Fallacy,
Political Agenda, and Intentionalistic Fallacy--are ones that EPs are accused of making,
whereas the others are made in the explication of evolutionary theory and its application to
humans.
E1) Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability. The assertion that many or all claims by EPs
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -479-
(1) lack substantive confirmatory evidence and/or (2) are unfalsifiable.
R1) (1) Evidence supports many claims made by EPs. Buss, Haselton, Shackelford, Bleske,
and Wakefield (1998, Table 1) summarized 30 empirical discoveries about human nature
generated by explicit evolutionary theorizing, including mother-fetus conflict and
landscape preference. More recently, Buss and Schmitt (2011, Table 1) summarized 17
robust empirical findings regarding sex differences in desire for sexual variety. Many more
empirical findings are reviewed in introductory evolutionary psychology textbooks (e.g.,
Badcock, 2000; Barrett, Dunbar, and Lycett, 2002; Buss, 2008; Cartwrigtht, 2000; Gaulin
and McBurney, 2004; Workman and Reader, 2004). (2) Most hypotheses proposed by EPs
are falsifiable. Buss`s introductory textbook (1999) presented 11 methods and data sources
for testing evolutionary hypotheses (p. 54) and concluded that at least two of the methods
must support a hypothesis for it to have a firm empirical foundation (p. 65). Ketelaar and
Ellis (2000) devoted a full article to falsifiability and demonstrated that the charge that EP
claims are generally unfalsifiable is unwarranted. Last, Schmitt and Pilcher (2004) laid out
a rigorous program for testing evolutionary based hypotheses, and this emphasized the
importance of generating and testing empirical predictions.
Textbook Example: Sociobiology has some success in applying evolutionary theory to
animal behavior, but because it is virtually impossible to test the natural selection principles
on which it is based, empirical support for evolutionary links to human behavior is weak.
(Lindsey, 2011, p. 25).
E2) Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture. (1) The assertion
that EPs contend that biology determines or can explain all human behavior. (2) The
assertion that some phenomena are entirely cultural whereas others are entirely biological.
R2) (1) EPs do not contend that human nature is hardwired by genes or determined
exclusively by biology. In fact, introductory evolutionary psychology textbooks warn
about deterministic views of human nature (e.g., Buss, 2008; Gaulin and McBurney, 2004).
For example, Rossano (2003) states, Evolutionary psychologists firmly reject both genetic
determinism and environmental determinism and, instead, contend that both genes and
environment must be considered in understanding the human mind (p. 28). (2) EPs believe
that understanding human nature requires an interactionist framework; i.e., incorporating
both biology and culture. As Tooby and Cosmides (1992) point out:
Evolution shapes the relationship between the genes and the environment such that
they both participate in a coordinated way in the construction and calibration of
adaptations. Thus, evolutionarily patterned structure is coming in from the
environment, just as much as it is coming out from the genes. (p. 86)
In short, nature and nurture are inseparable in the EP account.
Textbook Example: What`s more, if these [biological] explanations are true, no amount
of political initiative, no amount of social spending, no great policy upheavals will change
the relationships between women and men (Kimmel, 2013, p. 22).
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology

E3) Naturalistic Fallacy. The assertion that EPs contend that what exists is either ipso
facto good or morally desirable simply because it exists.
R3) The accusation that EPs are guilty of the naturalistic fallacy is belied by numerous
writings from early sociobiologists (e.g., Alexander, 1979; Symons, 1979) and more
recently from evolutionary psychologists. In The Selfish Gene, Richard Dawkins (1976)
writes, I am not advocating a morality based on evolution. I am saying how things have
evolved. I am not saying how we humans morally ought to behave (pp. 2-3). Many
introductory textbooks on evolutionary psychology contain explicit warnings about
committing the naturalistic fallacy (e.g., Bridgeman, 2003; Buss, 1999; Cartwright, 2000;
Palmer and Palmer, 2002; Rossano, 2003).
Textbook Example: Biological arguments reassure us that what is is what should be, that
the social is natural. Finally, such reassurances tell us that these existing inequalities are not
our fault, that no one is to blame, really (Kimmel, 2013, p. 22).
E4) Political/Ideological Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy. (1) The assertion that EPs
have a conservative, rightwing political agenda and that this agenda significantly influences
their research. (2) The assertion that evolutionary accounts are morally dubious and
possibly dangerous if widely disseminated.
R4) (1) To the extent that we have empirical data on the political views of EPs, this
assertion appears to be false. Most of the early sociobiologists were liberals or social
democrats (including E.O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins), while Robert Trivers, who
developed the theory of parental investment, was a political radical who coauthored a paper
with Huey Newton (Segreståle, 2000; Trivers, 2002). A recent study of EPs found that their
political views match those of social scientists in general--0 of 31 EPs identified with the
Republican Party (Tybur et al., 2007). Even if it were true that EPs have more conservative
views than other social scientists, it would not automatically follow that they are more
likely than others to use their scholarship to advance a conservative agenda. We know of no
data addressing this possibility, and the textbooks making this assertion do not provide any
evidence for it. (2) Unfortunately, almost any view of human nature can be used to justify
self-serving behavior that harms other people, ranging from the extremes of Nazism on the
right to communism on the left (Pinker, 2002). The communists, for example, perpetrated
numerous ghastly crimes, which were justified by a singular commitment to human
flexibility, environmental determinism, and equality (Pipes, 2001). However, the factual
content of a theory or proposition is not determined by the perceived good or ill it may do
to society.
Textbook Example: Another concern is the claim that gender differences have evolved
over time, which implies that gender differences are inevitable and unchangeable. Biology
then becomes an excuse for accepting differences and not advocating for social change
(Rider, 2005, p. 117).
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -481-
E5) Species Selection. The assertion that evolution via natural and sexual selection
operates to ensure species survival or that the survival of the species is the goal of
evolution.
R5) Charles Darwin (1859/1958; 1871) argued that natural and sexual selection targeted
the individual, not the species. In the 1960s, evolutionary biologists revolutionized the field
by formalizing the insight that it was not the individual but the gene that was the
fundamental unit of selection (Dawkins, 1976; Hamilton, 1964a,b). Although there is
debate about the importance of differing units or levels of selection (e.g., group, individual,
gene; Wilson and Wilson, 2007), biologists are nearly unanimous that species level
selection does not occur:
In the early post-Darwinian period when thinking about selection was rather
confused, it was often said that such and such a character had evolved because it
was good for the species. This is quite misleading. The selected character had
originated because it benefited certain individuals of a species and had gradually
spread to all others. The species as an entity does not answer to selection. (Mayr,
1997, p. 2092)
Textbook Example: Evolutionary theory argues that in any species, including humans,
certain characteristics persist across generations--passed along genetically--because they
help the species survive (Lips, 2006, p. 132).
E6) Straw Man Argument (Not Otherwise Specified). A misrepresentation of the
opponent`s position which creates the illusion that the argument in question has been
refuted when, in fact, the actual position of the opponent has not been addressed.
R6) Straw Man arguments must be examined case by case but often involve
oversimplifying the arguments of EPs to make them appear careless or reductionist. For
example, many critics of EP assert that the theory posits that all men are promiscuous
when, to our knowledge, this is not a serious position of EPs.
Textbook Example: Because each Straw Man argument is somewhat unique, aside from
those that fall into specified errors we have already cataloged, each requires its own
explanation (see Appendix for detailed comments on each coded Straw Man error).
E7) Intentionalistic Fallacy. The assertion that EPs contend that humans intentionally
attempt to enhance their inclusive fitness and are explicitly aware of such intentions. For
example, the claim that using contraception and engaging in sex for the sake of pleasure
rather than reproduction refutes evolutionary arguments regarding natural and sexual
selection.
R7) EPs do not believe that humans are consciously aware of the evolutionary logic of
their behavior. E.O. Wilson, the founder of sociobiology, made the point that the brain has
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -482-
been programmed to perform as if it knows [emphasis added] the underlying evolutionary
logic of its affective biases (Wilson, 1975, p. 4). Similarly, John Tooby and Leda Cosmides
(1992), two of the founders of evolutionary psychology, state ...the biological concept of
functionality differs from the folk notion of functionality as goal-seeking behavior.
Although some of our evolved psychological mechanisms probably operate through goal-
seeking, surely none of them has fitness maximization as a mentally represented goal (p.
54). Even in cases where humans explicitly represent goals (e.g., I need to protect my child;
I would like to have sex), EPs do not posit that they are aware of the evolutionary logic
guiding the specific goal in question (see for example, Buss, 1999; Geary, 2005).
Textbook Example: The sociobiological view of sex differences assumes that sexual
intercourse will lead ­ or is intended to lead ­ to reproduction. Today, I doubt that the
majority of men are thinking about establishing paternity and the majority of women are
thinking about their partners` ability to support a child when deciding whether or not to
engage in sex. (Helgeson, 2012, p. 114)
E8) Mechanical Demonstration. The assertion that if a scholar lacks knowledge of the
specific proximate mechanism(s) contributing to a behavior, then that scholar is unable to
legitimately make any claims about the evolutionary function of the behavior. For example,
the claim that sex differences in cognition cannot have an evolutionary basis because the
precise genes, neurotransmitters, and evolutionary pressures giving rise to them are not
perfectly understood.
R8) It is, of course, desirable to have perfect knowledge of all of the physiological, genetic,
and historical components of a hypothesized adaptation, but this is not necessary to make
informed hypotheses about human adaptations. George Williams (1966) developed
rigorous criteria for evaluating adaptations (reliability, efficiency, and economy) and these
criteria can be used for evaluating evident design features of humans (e.g., the eye,
opposable thumbs, fever) without knowing the precise physiological basis of the adaptation
in question (see also Buss, 1999; Tooby and Cosmides, 1992). We also note that scholars
using non-evolutionary perspectives routinely and fruitfully advance hypotheses about the
causes of behavior without providing a comprehensive account of all mechanisms involved
in the causal pathway.
Textbook Example: Evolutionary psychologists fail to specify the biological mechanisms
from evolution to behavior. Their basic arguments are that evolution occurred over millions
of years and, voila, we have a certain pattern of gender differences in the 21st century. But
evolution can act only through genes, and genes influence behavior because they direct the
synthesis of certain proteins and not others, leading to differing levels of biochemicals
such as neurotransmitters or hormones. This is the era of the Human Genome Project, in
which specific genes that create specific medical conditions and behaviors are being
identified. Evolutionary psychology has failed to incorporate this work, and fails to specify
which genes and biochemicals are responsible for the patterns of gender differences that
they claim have evolved. (Hyde and Else-Quest, 2013, p. 35)

Results
Three textbooks (Anderson, 2011; Crawford, 2012; Renzetti, Curran, and Maier,
2012) were not coded because they did not discuss the theoretical framework of EP. Of the
12 remaining textbooks, all contained at least one error (see Table 1 and Fig. 1; see
Appendix for complete documentation of every coded error). The mean number of errors
per book was 5.75 (SD = 3.81) and the median was 5; this statistic allows that a book may
commit an error type more than once. Across books, the mean number of error types was
3.75 (SD = 1.86) and the median was 3.5. Not surprisingly, there was a strong correlation
between the number of pages devoted to discussing EP and total errors, r = .73.
The Straw Man error was the most frequent, occurring 17 times in nine textbooks.
Because this category of error is the most open-ended, the result is not surprising. The
Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature and Nurture error was the second most
frequent (14 times in nine textbooks). The Naturalistic Fallacy and Intentionalistic Fallacy
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -485-
errors were the least frequent, occurring four times in three textbooks and four times in four
textbooks, respectively. Psychology undergraduate textbooks devoted more pages to EP (M
= 5.67, SD = 3) than did sociology textbooks (M = 3.67, SD = 4.59); Sociology textbooks
contained more types and more overall errors than did psychology textbooks (see Table 2).
We note that the sample size was extremely small so these results should be treated with
due caution.
Discussion
Our study improves upon previous studies by furnishing a well-defined catalog of
errors in the presentation of EP and demonstrating that these errors occur frequently in
undergraduate sex and gender textbooks. EPs have frequently addressed these errors (Buss,
1999; Confer et al., 2011; Pinker, 2002), but our results demonstrate that, despite these
efforts, errors persist.
Although these results are discouraging, they are also encouraging because the
factual errors can be corrected and future textbook writers, equipped with a more accurate
understanding of evolutionary theory, can produce balanced (but critical) textbooks. EP
should be exposed to rigorous criticism and debate; however, that cannot happen if
researchers are not well-informed. There are well-informed criticisms of EP`s analysis of
sex differences, and these can lead to a more comprehensive and flexible theory. For
example, Wood and Eagly (2012) have published widely cited criticisms of a biologically-
based analysis of the origins of human sex differences. Scholars debate their conclusions,
but they can serve as catalysts for future research and clarification of hypotheses (see also
Eagly and Wood, 1999; Wood and Eagly, 2002).
A possible concern with the current study is the accuracy of our error catalog.
Perhaps, for example, EPs do espouse a form of biological determinism (E2), a common
attribution of the textbooks (see Results), despite explicitly arguing that evolutionary theory
does not entail such determinism. To some degree, this will depend upon perspective. A
researcher who believes that biology plays no role in causing sex and gender differences
will view any suggestion otherwise as redolent of biological determinism. What is
important, however, are not the specifics of this debate, but rather whether EP is accurately
represented in textbooks. The passages in sex and gender textbooks that we coded as errors
are contradicted by quotes from EP textbooks, which consistently urge researchers to avoid
making the four fallacies attributed to evolutionary psychologists (see EP textbooks in
references). Furthermore, these passages are contradicted by numerous peer-reviewed
articles (see EP textbooks for references).
The evidence for all errors is provided in the Appendix, and researchers can
evaluate these themselves. Some might argue that specific EPs do make the errors imputed
to them by the textbooks we coded. However, our contention is that mainstream EP as a
field does not commit these errors and should not be judged nor characterized by the
writings or assertions of one or two unorthodox scholars. Moreover, in making these claims
(EPs generally espouse Biological Determinism), the textbooks invariably failed to
provide a single case of an EP making the error.
We anticipate a few more concerns, some of which represent limitations of the
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology

present research and some of which underscore the need for further research. First, we did
not apply our catalog of errors to textbooks that were not focused on sex and gender. This
should be done because general introductory textbooks reach a wider audience than sex and
gender textbooks.
Second, sex and gender researchers from a more social constructionist perspective
may argue that EP textbooks and articles similarly mischaracterize their theories and
arguments. If true, we welcome careful documentation of this problem, because this can
lead to increased understanding. Nevertheless, this does not mitigate or excuse the shoddy
treatment of EP documented here.
Last, we simply demonstrated that textbooks frequently make errors; we did not
establish that such errors are perpetuated or have an impact on students. It is, however,
reasonable to posit that students are exposed to these errors (from reading textbooks,
listening to lectures, or both) and that such exposure influences student attitudes about EP,
as we hypothesized. More research is necessary to demonstrate causal links between
textbook errors and student knowledge and attitudes. A clear prediction from the current
research is that students will be more hostile toward EP after taking sex and gender classes
and that the hostility of the used textbook will moderate this effect.
On a practical level, we suggest several recommendations to improve the quality of
textbooks. First, sex and gender textbook writers could communicate with EPs and send
them preliminary versions of their chapters. Second, EPs could write their own textbooks.
This would certainly increase the accuracy of the presentation of EP. However, it may
create its own problems and may provoke suspicion in an unsympathetic audience. Perhaps
the best solution would be to encourage more collaboration between EPs and researchers
who operate from different theoretical perspectives. This would allow both perspectives
full and honest expression and would allay the concerns of skeptical researchers who might
anticipate ideological distortions from authors who belonged to one theoretical camp or
another.

Appendix: Documentation of all Coded Errors
Note: E# = Error number from coding rubric; R# = See coding rubric rebuttal for
explanation of error.
Lips, H. M. (2006). A new psychology of women: Gender, culture, and ethnicity (3rd ed.).
Quotation: Evolutionary theory argues that in any species, including humans, certain
characteristics persist across generations--passed along genetically--because they help the
species survive. (p. 132) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Researchers studying humans find that the patterns expected by evolutionary
theory--a male tendency to want more sexual partners and to prefer women who are young
and attractive (presumably signs of fertility) and female tendencies to be more selective and
choose mates with plenty of resources--are not universal. (p. 134) (Other Errors)
Comment: Although there is substantial within sex and cross-cultural variation, these
general patterns are found universally or nearly so (Betzig, 1986; Buss, 1989; Kenrick and
Keefe, 1992; Schmitt, 2005).
Quotation: For example, it is simply not universally true that women tend to carefully
choose one man and then try to hold onto him, whereas men tend to try to have sex with as
many women as possible. (p. 135) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: EPs do not hold this view. EPs posit that there are myriad reasons that women
engage in casual sex (Chisholm, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Greiling and Buss,
2000). EPs also recognize that men may be choosey and have posited several reasons for
such choosiness, with paternal investment of particular importance (Geary, 2000; Marlowe,
2000).
Quotation: These theories suggest ways in which behavior is grounded in biology, but
other theories illustrate how we transcend our biology and respond to a multitude of social
forces. (p. 135) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture, E2)
(R2)
Caplan, P. J., & Caplan, J. B. (2009). Thinking critically about research on sex and
gender (2nd ed.).
Quotation: Some early and some contemporary heirs of Darwin are similar to Social
Darwinists in important ways: They have often based their theories on the assumption that
existing human behavior patterns are good things because they are the patterns that
survived as humans have evolved, and therefore must help to ensure the survival of the
human species. (p. 20) (Naturalistic Fallacy, E3; Species Selection, E5) (R3 & R5)
Quotation: Although Buss occasionally says that he is not justifying those kinds of
behavior and acknowledges some within-sex variability, his focus is on arguing that these
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -492-
patterns are necessary to preserve the human species. (p. 20) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: This illustrates a fundamental problem for many EP [evolutionary
psychological] theorists, which is that they assume all sex related behavior to be
universal... (p. 20) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: EPs do not assume all sex related behavior is universal. EPs have posited many
factors to explain within sex and cultural variation in sex related behavior including
pathogen prevalence, life history factors, and socialization (Gangestad and Simpson, 2000;
Gangestad, Haselton, and Buss, 2006; Heine and Norenzayan, 2006).
Quotation: An additional problem is that, because EP is based on notions about what had
survival value millions of years before, many of its theories are no more provable than, for
instance, Freud`s claim that all girls have penis envy and that those girls who deny it are
simply deceiving themselves. (p. 21) (Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability, E1) (R1)
Quotation: Some of EP is like Buss`s work not only in being based on unquestioned
assumptions about what is right and good... (p. 21) (Naturalistic Fallacy, E3) (R3)
Quotation: Another example is Buss`s presentation as evidence of women`s greediness
for wealthy husbands the fact that his colleague reported overhearing a conversation among
four women in a restaurant, in which the women complained that there were no eligible
men around, even though, Buss says, they were surrounded by male waiters, none of
whom was wearing a wedding ring.` (p. 21) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: Buss (2003) does not make use of loaded phrases such as greediness for
wealthy husbands. The paragraph to which Caplan and Caplan refer follows two
paragraphs that detail a study about what men and women value in potential spouses (Buss,
2003, p. 26). This study included several hundred individuals and found that Women
judge the likelihood of success in a profession and the possession of a promising career to
be highly desirable in a spouse (p. 26). The study also found that women rate the lack of
education as highly undesirable in a potential husband (ibid). The first sentence of the
offending paragraph reads, Women`s desire for status shows up in everyday occurrences
(ibid). Buss then describes the conversation, which is intended as an anecdote to
supplement the previously described study. Note that The Evolution of Desire is a book
intended to popularize Buss` peer-reviewed research.
Quotation: Evolutionary biologists and psychologists theorize that current humans`
sexual behavior is that which for millennia has promoted the survival of the species. (p.
79) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: The most common evolutionary story is focused on heterosexuals (making it
heteronormative) and based on the assumption that men try to increase the frequency of
their genes in the population by impregnating as many women as possible, whereas women
are more selective and choose men who will be good providers to their offspring (Buss,
2000). That theory is problematic partly because of the failure to take homosexuals into
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology

account. (p. 79) (Straw man, E6) (R6)
Comment: There are many papers by EPs addressing homosexuality (e.g., Bobrow and
Bailey, 2001; Camperio-Ciani, Corna, and Capiluppi, 2004; Iemmola and Ciani, 2009;
Rahman and Hull, 2005; Rahman and Wilson, 2003).
Helgeson, V. S. (2012). The psychology of gender (4th ed.).
Quotation: Sociobiology examines the biological origins of social behavior--in other
words, how social behavior evolved over time to perpetuate the species. (p. 143) (Species
Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Cultural factors may have overridden the influence of evolutionary theory on
sexual behavior (p. 144) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature &
Nurture, E2) (R2)
Quotation: The sociobiological view of sex differences assumes that sexual intercourse
will lead ­ or is intended to lead ­ to reproduction. Today, I doubt that the majority of men
are thinking about establishing paternity and the majority of women are thinking about
their partners` ability to support a child when deciding whether or not to engage in sex. (p.
144) (Intentionalistic Fallacy, E7) (R7)
Lindsey, L. (2011). Gender roles: A sociological perspective (5th ed.).
Quotation: This Darwinian view suggests simply that sex differences (such as sexuality,
cognitive ability, and parenting) and gender differences (such as toy preferences, college
major, and career choice) have adaptive advantages for species survival. (p. 24) (Species
Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Sociobiologists believe that principles of evolution pointing to species
survival provide the best understanding of how gendered social behaviors developed. (p.
24) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Sociobiology has some success in applying evolutionary theory to animal
behavior, but because it is virtually impossible to test the natural selection principles on
which it is based, empirical support for evolutionary links to human behavior is weak. (p.
25) (Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability, E1) (R1)
Quotation: Such approaches present data with overtones that may serve political agendas.
Stereotypes about male dominance in all species and untested, untestable assumptions
about the evolution of sex differences distort an otherwise valid approach to understanding
evolution. (p. 25) (Lack of Evidence/ Lack of Falsifiability, E1; Political/Ideological
Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy E5) (R1 & R5)
Quotation: For humans, new research suggests that the view that humans have sex only
to reproduce rather than for sexual stimulation or to experience pleasure disregards an
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -494-
entire range of emotions, personality traits, and sexual strategies that cannot be traced to
animals. (p. 25) (Intentionalistic Fallacy, E7) (R7)
Quotation: Feminist scientific critiques center on the fact that sociobiology and similar
evolutionary approaches are androcentric perspectives, are often presented in deterministic
ways, and make faulty assumptions about human behavior and disregard well-documented
research about animals. (p. 25) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature &
Nurture, E2) (R2)
Comment: It is not clear what is meant by androcentric but many of the leading EPs are,
in fact, women (e.g., Leda Cosmides, Martie Haselton, Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Anne
Campbell, Joyce Benenson, Bobbi Low, Laura Betzig, Sarah Hill, etc.). It is also not clear
which animal studies are disregarded.
Quotation: Conventional Darwinian wisdom about competition and the desire to pass on
selfish genes does not conform to newer models suggesting that humans are naturally
predisposed to altruism and cooperation. Attempts by humans to dominate other humans
through violence, distrust, and cruelty were uncommon in early humans because they were
maladaptive. (p. 25) (Straw man, E6) (R6)
Comment: EPs were among the first to explicate the logic of cooperation in animals and
humans (Axelrod and Hamilton, 1981; Hamilton, 1964a; Hamilton, 1964b; Trivers, 1971)
and they continue to be interested in human prosociality (Fehr and Fischbacher, 2003;
Fischbacher and Gachter, 2002; Gintis, 2000). The assertion that attempts by humans to
dominate others through violence were rare in early human history is factually incorrect.
Numerous scholarly works demonstrate that early humans were violent by today`s
standards (Bowles, 2006; Gat, 2006; Ghilgieri, 1999; Keegan, 1994; Keeley, 1996;
LeBlanc and Register, 2003; Otterbein, 2004).
Quotation: Nonetheless, a great deal of rapidly emerging data in many disciplines
suggests that the nature versus nurture view must be replaced by the more empirically
sound and productive nature and nurture view. (p. 52) (Biological
Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture, E2) (R2)
Comment: The author is accusing EP of being a nature view.
Johnson, A. G. (2005). Gender knot: Unraveling our patriarchical legacy (2nd ed.).
Quotation: And if we believe in evolution, essentialism backs us into the corner of
arguing that privilege and oppression are actually a positive adaptation, that societies
organized in this way will thrive more than those that aren`t p. 52. (Naturalistic Fallacy,
E3) (R3)
Brannon, L. (2011) Gender: Psychological perspectives (6th ed.).
Quotation: Evolutionary psychology contends that women`s and men`s brains have
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -495-
evolved in different ways that furnish modern humans with hard-wired gender
differences... (p. 1) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture,
E2) (R2)
Quotation: Evolutionary psychology also predicts that attractiveness should be more
important in heterosexual attraction than for gay or lesbian couples. (p. 215) (Other
Errors)
Comment: EP does not make this prediction. It predicts that physical attractiveness should
be relatively more important to men than women on average (Buss, 1999). There is
research that supports the hypothesis that gay men are more concerned with physical
attractiveness in romantic partners than are lesbian women (Bartholome, Tewksbury, and
Bruzzone, 2000; Hata and Prehodka, 1996; Smith and Stillman, 2002). This is entirely
consistent with EP.
Quotation: A more reliable [than youth and attractiveness] sign of reproductive capability
is having borne children; however, the evolutionary psychologists do not hypothesize that
women with young children are the most attractive potential mates, despite their
demonstrated reproductive success. (p. 215) (Other Errors)
Comment: There are many reasons that EPs do not hypothesize this: 1) The significant
level of paternal investment in many societies (Geary, 2000: Marlow, 2000) means that
men who preferred women with children would potentially invest resources in non-genetic
children. 2) Bearing children may deplete women of essential fatty acids that impact infant
brain development (Lassek and Gaulin, 2006; Lassek and Gaulin, 2008). 3) Youth is
probably the most important indicator of fertility; concluding that a 40 year old woman is
fertile simply because she has a child is erroneous (Schwartz and Mayaux, 1982). 4) Men
who are seeking long-term partners must take into account not just current fertility but also
residual reproductive value (the expected future contribution of the women to the gene
pool) (Buss, 2003; Confer, Perilloux, and Buss, 2010; Symons, 1979). For these reasons
and more, it is extremely implausible that men would evolve adaptive mechanisms for
finding woman with children desirable solely because they had children.
Quotation: Evolutionary psychology is a maximalist theory that proposes that human
evolutionary history has equipped people with preprogrammed patterns of behavior that
differ a great deal between women and men. These theorists tend to rationalize the
disadvantaged social position of women by citing biological programming as the source of
differences. Naomi Weisstein (1982, p. 41) summarized this position by saying, Men are
biologically suited to their life of power, pleasure, and privilege, and women must accept
subordination, sacrifice, and submission. It`s in the genes. Go fight city hall.` (p. 433)

pursue a long-term mating strategy. Thus, men try to inseminate as many women as
possible and minimize their commitment and investment in any single woman. (p. 113)
(Straw man, E6) (R6)
Comment: Buss and Schmitt (1993) argue that both men and women adopt short-term and
long-term mating strategies.
Quotation: Another concern is the claim that gender differences have evolved over time,
which implies that gender differences are inevitable and unchangeable. Biology then
becomes an excuse for accepting differences and not advocating for social change. (p.

Quotation: Sociobiological explanations for human kinship, for instance, foundered when
the predictions of genetics failed to match the realities of kinship systems actually
documented by anthropologists (Sahlins 1977). It seems that social logic works
independently of genetic logic. (p. 54) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy between
Nature & Nurture, E2) (R2)
Quotation: The evolutionary psychology` arguments are based on an unrealistic
individualism, which takes no account of institutionalized gender arrangements. For
instance, in discussing the higher levels of violence among men than among women, all
that Geary (1998) can see is male vs male competition for reproductive resources. He
cannot see military institutions, insurgencies, mafias, or cultural definitions of manhood ­
let alone football. P. 54 (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: This is not an accurate portrayal of Geary`s (1998) position. Geary uses the
theory of sexual selection to explain evolved differences between men and women. Thus,
his focus is not on institutional arrangements. However, he does document that male-on-
male physical violence fluctuates depending on the cultural milieu (see pp. 139-144). For
example, Geary states, ...men in industrial societies compete in terms of the indicators of
success in these cultures--primarily in terms of educational and occupational status... (p.
144). Geary concludes his book by noting:
Just as research in the biological and medical sciences has reduced the pain and
suffering that were an integral part of our evolutionary past (e.g., infectious
diseases), biologically informed psychological research on social, emotional,
behavioral, and cognitive processes that have been shaped by evolutionary selection
can result in strategies for changing the ways in which these evolved biases are

expressed in modern society. (p. 331)
Quotation: But the most striking problem about sociobiology and evolutionary
psychology, given the constant appeals to science`, to evolution and to Darwin, is that the
entire argument is based on speculation. Not one sex difference in psychological
characteristics has actually been shown to result from evolutionary mechanisms. (p. 54)

Quotation: In sociobiology...and popular ideologies of natural difference, bodily
difference is understood to be a conservative force. It holds back historical change, limits
what social action can accomplish. But we can now see that bodies as agents in social
practice are involved in the very construction of the social world, the bringing-into-being of
social reality. (p. 71) (Political/Ideological Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy, E5) (R5)
Comment: This paragraph is somewhat difficult to parse. It seems as though the author is
stating that believing in bodily difference leads to a conservative view of the world and that
this has negative ramifications.
Smith, B. (2007). The psychology of sex and gender.
Quotation: The theory of evolution proposed by Wilson has been interpreted as genetic
determinism when applied to explanations for human behavior. Wilson`s argument is that
human behavior is controlled by genes, rather than by the environment, or by the
interaction of biology and the environment. (p. 133) (Straw man, E6) (R6)
Comment: E.O. Wilson (1975) makes explicit his view that humans are extremely flexible
and that the environment is of overriding importance. As Wilson put it, Although the
genes have given away most of their sovereignty, they maintain a certain amount of
influence in at least the behavioral qualities that underlie variations between cultures (p.
550). He makes a more elaborate interactionist argument in his 1978 book, On Human
Nature.
Lips, H. M. (2008). Sex & gender: An introduction (6th ed.).
Quotation: The claims of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology are couched in the
language of Darwin`s (1871/1967) theory of evolution--a theory developed to explain the
way the physical characteristics of animals change over successive generations to favor
those that were most conducive to species survival. (p. 79) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: This theory postulates that a physical characteristic is adaptive if it contributes
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -498-
to the maximum fitness of the species, where maximum fitness means being able to reach
sexual maturity and leave healthy descendants. (p. 79) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Yet evolutionary approaches to social behavior claim that underneath our
cultural trappings lie genetically based human universals: sexual aggressivity among men, a
sexual division of labor that assigns child care to women, and an innate desire for sexual
variety among men but not women. Moreover, the proponents of this approach argue that
the genetic basis of these social patterns makes them more or less inescapable, not for
individuals but for humans as a species. (p. 80) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy
between Nature & Nurture, E2) (R2)
Quotation: Animal data do not always support the thesis that males are programmed
for promiscuity and females are instinctively more selective. (p. 81) (Straw man, E6)
(R6)
Comment: This represents a fundamental misunderstanding of Trivers` (1972) important
paper on parental investment and sexual selection. According to parental investment
theory, it is not sex per se that determines choosiness; it is the relative investment of
parents in their offspring. Parental investment theory, in fact, predicts sex-role reversed
species:
Where male parental investment strongly exceeds that of the female (regardless of
which sex invests more in the sex cells) one would expect females to compete
among themselves for males and for males to be selective about whom they accept
as a mate. (Trivers, 1972, p. 141)
Consistent with parental investment theory, biologists have found that in species where
males invest more in their offspring than females (e.g., Jacanas, Pipefish, Phalaropes, etc.),
they tend to be choosier (Delehanty, Fleisher, Colwell, and Oring, 1998; Eens and Pinxten,
2000; Emlen and Wrege, 2004). Scholars have critiqued Trivers` formulation and offered
subtler accounts (e.g., Queller, 1997; Wade and Shuster, 2002). However, these accounts
still predict sex-role reversal in a variety of circumstances.
Quotation: So, the notion that gender differences in behavior stem from different
genetically based strategies evolved by females and males to maximize their reproductive
fitness, while intriguing, has not been proven. If a genetic basis should be established for
some of the behaviors in question, to date scientists have no way of knowing whether their
persistence is the result of random genetic events or (as sociobiologists argue) of
adaptations for fitness maximization (Fausto-Sterling, 1992). (p. 83) (Lack of Evidence/
Lack of Falsifiability, E1; Mechanical Demonstration, E8) (R1 & R8)
Quotation: ...if humans have evolved behavioral tendencies to maximize reproductive
success, these tendencies probably cannot be summed up in such simple terms as men
compete and women choose` or men are promiscuous and women are selective.` (p. 83)
(Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: EPs do not hold this view. EPs posit that there are many reasons that women
engage in casual sex (Chisholm, 1993; Gangestad and Simpson, 2000; Greiling and Buss,
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -499-
2000). EPs also recognize that men may be choosey and have posited several reasons for
such choosiness (Geary, 2000; Marlowe, 2000).
Quotation: ...many species provide exceptions to the idea that males always compete for
mates and females always choose on the basis of best genes. Also, there are numerous
examples (among nonhuman primates as well as humans) in which sexual behavior is
clearly linked more to pleasure and to cementing relationships than to procreation--and
much more mating takes place than is necessary simply to ensure procreation. (p. 292)
(Straw Man, E6; Intentionalistic Fallacy, E7) (R6 & R7)
Quotation: Convincing evidence for an evolutionary explanation of this difference [in
promiscuity] would involve demonstrating both that the behavior in question has a genetic
basis and that it is adaptive for reproductive success. (p. 292) (Mechanical
Demonstration, E8) (R8)
Kimmel, M. S. (2013). The gendered society (5th ed.).
Quotation: Biological arguments reassure us that what is is what should be, that the social
is natural. Finally, such reassurances tell us that these existing inequalities are not our fault,
that no one is to blame, really. (p. 22) (Naturalistic Fallacy, E3) (R3)
Quotation: What`s more, if these [biological] explanations are true, no amount of
political initiative, no amount of social spending, no great policy upheavals will change the
relationships between women and men. (p. 22) (Biological Determinism/Dichotomy
between Nature & Nurture, E2) (R2)
Quotation: Take, for example, the size and the number of the reproductive cells
themselves. Add to that the relative cost to male and female in producing a healthy
offspring, and--presto!--you have the differences between male and female sexual
behavior at a typical college mixer this weekend. (p. 26) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: Although this comment is obviously intended to be facetious, EPs would not
completely disagree. For example, men, on average, do desire more sexual variety than
women and are less reticent about engaging in casual sex (Buss and Schmitt, 2011; Clark
and Hatfield, 1989). Men, on average, also experience less sexual regret than women
(Campbell, 2008; Eshbaugh and Gute, 2008; Townsend and Wasserman, 2011). However,
EPs also acknowledge the importance of individual and contextual factors in sexual
behavior (Buss, 1999; Simpson and Gangestad, 2000). Further, most EPs would not
attempt a facile explanation of a college mixer based solely on parental investment theory.
Quotation: Thus males are hardwired genetically to be promiscuous sexual predators,
ever on the prowl for new potential sexual conquests, whereas females have a built-in
biological tendency toward monogamy, fantasies of romantic love and commitment
coupled with sexual behavior, and a certain sexual reticence that can be overcome only by
chivalric male promises of fealty and fidelity. (p. 27) (Biological

Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture, E2; Straw Man, E6) (R2 & R6)
Comment: EPs do not believe that women have a built in biological tendency toward
monogamy (Barash and Lipton, 2002; Draper and Harpending, 1982; Gangestad,
Thornhill, and Garver-Apgar, 2005). As previously documented, EPs do not believe that
men are genetically prone to be promiscuous sexual predators.
Quotation: Women, then, are biologically programmed to hold out ­but they better not
do it too long. If women were only a little bit more compliant, men wouldn`t be forced to
resort to rape as a reproductive tactic. (p. 28) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: As noted, not all women engage in exclusive long-term mating strategies (Buss
and Schmitt, 1993). The comment about rape is flippant and misconstrues EP`s views (e.g.,
Ellis, 1991; McKibbin, Shackelford, Goetz, and Starratt, 2008; Thornhill and Palmer,
2000).
Quotation: Can we explain each single sexual encounter by such grand evolutionary
designs? I would bet that most of our conscious strategies at college mixers have more
immediate goals than to ensure our reproductive success. (p. 28) (Intentionalistic
Fallacy, E7) (R7)
Quotation: Some arguments go far beyond what the data might explain and into areas that
are empirically untestable. Biologist Richard Lewontin, a passionate critic of sociobiology,
argues that no evidence at all is presented for the genetic basis of these characteristics
[religion, warfare, cooperation] and the arguments for their establishment by natural
selection cannot be tested, since such arguments postulate hypothetical situations in human
prehistory that are uncheckable. And fellow evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould
denies that there is any direct evidence for genetic control of specific human social
behavior. (p. 28-29) (Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability, E1; Mechanical
Demonstration, E8) (R1 & R8)
Quotation: Sociobiologists tend to favor male-dominant species to demonstrate the
ubiquity of male dominance. (p. 29) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: There is no evidence that EPs favor male-dominated species for the purpose of
demonstrating the ubiquity of male dominance. In his discussion of ring-tailed lemurs, E.O.
Wilson (1975) notes, Adult females are dominant over adult males, a reversal of an
otherwise nearly universal primate pattern (p. 531). Although this pattern is still generally
held to be true, one of our closest relatives, the bonobo, does not exhibit a pattern of male
dominance. EPs have utilized the bonobo to better understand human evolution (De Waal,
1995; McHenry and Corruccin, 1981; Parish, 1994; Parish, De Waal, and Haig, 2000;
Wrangham, 1993). EPs emphasize whatever species can shed light on human behavior.
Quotation: The preposterous idea that rape is an evolutionary mating strategy for losers
in the sexual marketplace is belied by the most common form of rape in the United States.
Did you know that the majority of rapes in America have nothing whatever to do with
Misrepresentations of evolutionary psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(3). 2014. -501-
reproduction? You know why? The victims are male. In January 2012, the U.S. department
of Justice released an estimate of the prevalence of sexual abuse in penitentiaries:
216,000...These victims are often assaulted multiple times over the course of a year,
meaning the number of actual rapes is significantly higher. Such rates make the United
States the first country in the history of the world to count more men as rape victims than
women. And Thornhill and Palmer`s facile evolutionism is exposed as mere ideology. (p.
31) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: This simplifies the account given by Thornhill and Palmer (2000). Thornhill
and Palmer explicitly state that the question of whether rape is an adaption or a by-product
cannot be definitively answered... (p. 84). Further, Thornhill and Palmer never make the
argument that rapists are consciously thinking about reproduction. They take pains to
explain that humans are not aware of the evolutionary logic of many, if not most, of their
behaviors. Whatever one thinks of the Thornhill and Palmer book, the data that is cited
does not address their actual position because the U.S. has a unisex prison system.
Quotation: Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology provide us with what Rudyard
Kipling called a just-so story ­an account that uses some evidence to tell us how, for
example, an elephant got its trunk, or a tiger its stripes. Just-so stories are children`s fables,
understood by the reader to be fictions, but convenient, pleasant, and, ultimately, useful
fictions. (pp. 31-32) (Lack of Evidence/Lack of Falsifiability, E1) (R1)
Quotation: Another biological fact about women might make life even more confusing
for males seeking to determine paternity. Martha McClintock`s research about women`s
menstrual cycles indicated that in close quarters, women`s cycles tend to become
increasingly synchronous; that is over time, women`s cycles will tend to converge with
those of their neighbors and friends...What`s more, in cultures where artificial light is not
used, all the women will tend to ovulate at the full moon and menstruate at the new moon.
(p. 33) (Other Errors)
Comment: McClintock`s research has been criticized on methodological grounds and there
is now a near consensus that women`s cycles do not synchronize (Schank, 2000;
Strassman, 1997, 1999; Wilson, 1992; Yank and Schank, 2006; Ziomkiewicz, 2006). The
assertion that women tend to ovulate at the full moon is not supported by peer-reviewed
literature. Strassman (1997) tested the lunar hypothesis among the Dogon, a natural fertility
population lacking artificial lighting. Her data did not support the hypothesis.

Quotation: For example, the sociobiologist`s belief is that the greater aggression and
dominance of males are a result of sexual selection and are controlled by genes. Therefore,
men are genetically dominant, and women are genetically subordinate, and the subordinate
status of women will have to continue because it is genetic. (p. 33) (Biological
Determinism/Dichotomy between Nature & Nurture, E2; Political/Ideological
Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy, E5) (R2 & R5)
Quotation: Sociobiologists tend to view data from an androcentric (male-centered)
perspective and to talk selectively about those studies that confirm their androcentric
theory, ignoring those studies that contradict it. For example, the female chimpanzee...is
notoriously promiscuous (Janson-Smith, 1980). When she is in estrus (heat), she mates
indiscriminately with many males. That does not fit into sociobiology, which says that she
should be choosey about the male with whom she mates and that the most aggressive,
dominant male should be the only one to have the privilege of inseminating her. The
sociobiologists tend to ignore chimpanzees. (p. 33) (Political/Ideological
Agenda/Consequentialist Fallacy, E5; Straw man, E6) (R6)
Comment: EPs do not ignore the chimpanzee. E.O. Wilson (1975) mentions chimpanzees
on at least 20 pages of his foundational text, Sociobiology: The new synthesis. Introductory
EP textbooks also frequently discuss chimpanzees (e.g., Badcock, 2000, 5 pages; Barrett,
Dunbar, and Lycett, 2002, 7 pages; Bridgeman, 2003, 13 pages; Buss, 2008, 11 pages;
Cartwright, 2000, 7 pages). EPs have also made wide use of the chimpanzee when
developing models of human evolution (Chapais, 2009; Geary, 2010; Tomasello and
Hermann, 2010; Wrangham and Wilson, 2004; Wrangham, Wilson, and Muller, 2006).
Quotation: In discussing this [man the hunter], Wilson (1978, p. 127) makes much of
how natural selection for these traits is reflected in men`s current superiority in Olympic
track events. Later on the same page, he mentions that women are superior in precision
archery and small-bore rifle shooting in the Olympics, but does not see to see this as
inconsistent with the evolution of only man as the hunter. Woman the gatherer is ignored,
although she may have formed the foundation for early human social organization... (p.
34) (Straw Man, E6) (R6)
Comment: Wilson does discuss women`s role as gatherers (pp. 83-86). Here is the actual
passage dealing with Olympic events:
It is of equal importance that women match or surpass men in a few other sports,
and these are among the ones furthest removed from the primitive techniques of
hunting and aggression: long distance swimming, the more acrobatic events of
gymnastics, precision (but not distance) archery, and small-bore rifle shooting. As
sport-like activities evolve into more sophisticated channels dependent on skill and
agility, the overall achievements of men and women can be expected to converge
more closely. [emphasis added] (pp. 127-128)
There is no inconsistency.

Quotation: ...modern biologists focus on more complex issues such as the survival of the
group and the species, and the evolution of a successful adaptation between the species and
its environment. (p. 34) (Species Selection, E5) (R5)
Quotation: Evolutionary psychologists fail to specify the biological mechanisms from
evolution to behavior. Their basic arguments are that evolution occurred over millions of
years and, voila, we have a certain pattern of gender differences in the 21st century. But
evolution can act only through genes, and genes influence behavior because they direct the
synthesis of certain proteins and not others, leading to differing levels of biochemicals such
as neurotransmitters or hormones. This is the era of the Human Genome Project, in which
specific genes that create specific medical conditions and behaviors are being identified.
Evolutionary psychology has failed to incorporate this work, and fails to specify which
genes and biochemicals are responsible for the patterns of gender differences that they
claim have evolved. (p. 35) (Straw Man, E6; Mechanical Demonstration, E8) (R6 &
R8)
Comment: EPs do not make Lamarckian arguments about sex differences. EPs recognize
that evolution acts through the differential replication of genes and that genes influence
behavior through protein synthesis and differential production of hormones,
neurotransmitters, amino acids, etc. Men and women differ genetically because men have a
Y chromosome whereas women have two X chromosomes. EP has, in fact, incorporated
the work of endocrinologists, behavioral geneticists, molecular biologists, and
neuroscientists. Many EPs have studied the relation between hormones and sex differences
(Collaer and Hines, 1995; Puts, McDaniel, Jordan, and Breedlove, 2008; Van Anders and
Hampson, 2005) and many more have written about the topic (for a review, see Geary,
2010). Specifying the precise genes and biochemicals responsible for sex differences is
an arduous task but scientists are slowly making progress (Hines, 2011; Jazin and Cahill,
2010; McCarthy and Arnold, 2011; McCarthy, Arnold, Ball, Blaustein, and De Vries,
2012). EPs can only report the current state of knowledge on sex differences, genes,
hormones, and neurotransmitters.
