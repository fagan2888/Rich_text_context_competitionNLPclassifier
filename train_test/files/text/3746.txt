Abstract: Evolutionary ecological theory predicts that sleep-wake state tradeoffs may be
related to local environmental conditions and should therefore correlate to alterations in
behavioral life history strategies. It was predicted that firefighters who slept more and
reported better quality sleep on average would exhibit lower impulsivity inclinations
related to slower life history trajectories. UPPS impulsivity scores and self-reported sleep
averages were analyzed and indicated a negative association between sleep variables and
urgency and a positive association with premeditation. Perseverance, and in some cases
premeditation, however, disclosed an unpredicted marginally significant positive
association between increased and emergency nighttime waking-related sleep deprivation.
Sensation seeking was not associated with sleep variables, but was strongly associated with
number of biological children. This research contributes to understanding the implications
of human sleep across ecological and behavioral contexts and implies further research is
necessary for constructing evolutionarily oriented measures of impulsivity inclination and
its meaning in the context of life history strategies.

Introduction
Humans, like other animals, spend a great deal of their daily energy and time budget
sleeping. Sleep provides necessary maintenance and repair as a counter to waking activities
of reproduction and production (Siegal, 2005). Therefore, a fundamental tradeoff exists
between the asleep and awake states, and certain risky or resource poor environments may
result in shifts directing time away from sleep toward waking activities (Worthman, 2008;
Worthman and Melby, 2002). Impulsivity, a measure of future discounting and risk
inclination, is associated with fast life history strategies (Figueredo et al., 2006). This
research proposes that sleep quantity and quality, as altered by ecological conditions of
Sleep, impulsivity, and life history

resource or mating stresses, may queue alterations in future discounting as measured by
impulsivity inclinations.
Sleep
Anthropological insight into human sleep has been primarily restricted to cross-
cultural work on typical sleep environments and childcare practices (Worthman and Melby,
2002). Aside from a few notable exceptions, relatively little work has been done by
evolutionists on sleep ecology and associated behavioral and psychological outcomes
(Ferreira de Souza Aguiar, Periera da Silva, and Marks, 1991; J. McKenna, 1986; J.
McKenna and McDade, 2005; Worthman, 2008; Worthman and Brown, 2007; Worthman
and Melby, 2002). Anderson (1998) explains that this bias, at least among primatologists, is
presumably due to persistent research interests in daytime behavioral profiles. As such, a
large gap exists in our understanding of sleep and associated behavioral and psychological
outcomes among humans and other primates.
Sleep is commonly viewed as a daily anabolic state of repair and maintenance. The
circadian sleep rhythm, linked to the biological twenty-four hour clock in humans,
regulates our sleep-wake states partially through melatonin and partially through a
homeostatic drive. The rhythm plays roles in regulating bodily processes and functions
including body temperature, hormone secretion, urine production, blood pressure, and the
sleep-wake cycle (Arendt, 2006). There are two independent pathways whereby adequate
species-specific sleep improves physiological functions: sleep quality and sleep quantity.
An overarching biological perspective details the role of sleep in homeostatic drive, which
ultimately optimizes all biological and neurological functions and systems (Benington,
2000). Conversely, inadequate sleep quantity and quality exhibits significant behavioral
and physiological consequences (see Banks and Dinges, 2007, for review), including
decreased cognitive state regulation (Saper, Cano, and Scammell, 2005), diminished
immunological functioning (Opp, 2009) and impaired executive functioning (Nilsson et al.,
2005). Awake time, by comparison, seems essentially designed to achieve the major
evolutionary goals of production and reproduction and therefore a trade-off between sleep
and waking exists.
Indeed, the two states of human existence, awake and asleep, can be thought of as
competing systems in which the organism is either breaking down molecules for energy
(catabolic and awake) or constructing molecules, organs, and tissues from smaller units
(anabolic and asleep) (Rodéhn, 1999; Shneerson, 2005). The daily phases can be described
in the following ways: The sleeping state exists to rebuild and rejuvenate systems that are
catabolized, damaged, or require growth due to wakefulness activities of production and
reproduction. Because these phases achieve different tasks, and because they are mutually
exclusive, it can be observed that due to the principle of time allocation, time used for one
state cannot then be used for the other. Thus, if an organism spends more time sleeping it
will have less time for production and reproduction. However, because sleep builds, grows
and repairs the body, lack of sleep results in negative physiological, and perhaps risky,
behavioral consequences.

Impulsivity and Life History Theory
Impulsive behaviors include lack of premeditation before action, inability to
complete tasks, urgent decision-making and discounting of costs associated with risky
choices (Figueredo et al., 2006). Impulsivity has been correlated to future discounting
(Ostaszewski, 1997) and many other life history variables such as age at first sex, age at
first birth (Miller, Flory, Lynam, and Leukefeld, 2003), number of sexual partners (McCoul
and Haslam, 2001) and a vast array of risky sexual behaviors (Donohew et al., 2000;
Robbins and Bryan, 2004). Risky impulsivity, which measures risk taking without
premeditation, is a common cause of same-sex aggression and greater sociosexuality
(Cross, 2010), important components of a fast life history strategy. Additionally, consistent
with evolutionary theory, impulsivity decreases with age (Eysenck, Pearson, Easting, and
Allsopp, 1985) and higher impulsive tendencies are found in men than women (Waldeck
and Miller, 1997).
Personality psychologists have offered a framework, and some research supports,
that personality consistency may exist in combination with contextual, state-dependent
variations (Howard and Mason, 1994; Mischel, Mendoza-Denton, and Shoda, 2002;
Nederkoorn, Guerrieri, Havermans, Roefs, and Jansen, 2009; Wingrove and Bond, 1997).
Further, it has been posited that personality variation may be interpreted using a life history
framework and that personality phenotypes may mediate risks of ecological uncertainty in
securing reproductive opportunities (Quinlan, 2010). And indeed, Figueredo et al. (2006)
found that a purified measure (a scale which is drawn from several existing measures to
create a scale of both impulse behaviors and impulse control) of impulse control had a high,
positive correlation with a slow life history, as measured by the K-factor battery questions.
Figueredo's work also links a deviance factor, of which impulsivity is an important
component, to reduced executive functioning, a measure of the ability to set goals, plan,
sequence, prioritize, and inhibit pace, etc., which are ultimately linked to low K-factor
(Figueredo et al., 2006). Figueredo emphasizes that optimization of executive functioning
requires impulsivity inhibition. And, as demonstrated above, sleep quantity and quality
lessens executive functioning, which has a strong relationship with impulsivity (Bernier,
Carlson, Bordeleau, and Carrier, 2010; Harrison and Horne, 1999, 2000; Stenuit and
Kerhofs, 2008). Several studies also indicate a relationship between sleep deprivation and
related impulsivity concepts such as risk taking and delay discounting (Acheson, Richards,
and de Wit, 2007; Chaumet et al., 2009; B. McKenna, Dickinson, Orff, and Drummond,
2007; Reynolds and Schiffbauer, 2004; Schmidt, Gay, Ghisletta, and Van der Linden,
2010; Schmidt, Gay, and Van der Linden, 2008; Sicard, Jouve, and Blin, 2001;
Venkatraman, Chuah, Huettel, and Chee, 2007).
Further, increased dopamine is strongly, positively correlated to impulsivity and
future discounting (Pine, Shiner, Seymour, and Dolan, 2010). Therefore, a proximate
connection exists in that higher levels of melatonin from exposure to more darkness at
night, in part due to fewer nighttime interruptions, will cause dopamine to drop, thus
inhibiting impulsive behaviors. Likewise, higher frequency of waking interruptions,
particularly with light, will inhibit melatonin, resulting in rises in dopamine and concordant
impulsive behaviors. This relationship may also support a state context-dependent attribute
of impulse and predictions that impulsivity and risk inclination may be seasonally or

geographically affected.
Firefighters are typically referred to as shift workers and by extension are exposed
to unique occupation-specific environmental risks, including large variations in sleep
quantity and quality. This research investigates the behavioral variation in impulsivity
among firefighters, as both a trait and as state-dependent upon environmental
circumstances. Life history theory supposes that increases in impulsivity and future
discounting should be expected in risky, resource poor and unpredictable environments,
ultimately resulting in a switch from a slow to fast life history strategy, which may be
partly caused by the negative melatonin-dopamine relationship that exists in the presence of
sleep loss. During hominid evolution, poor sleep was likely a reflection of more
environmental danger and unpredictability. Thus, disturbed sleep is a proxy of local danger
and uncertainty. It is therefore expected that nightly variations in sleep quantity and quality
act as cues regarding local environmental circumstances about the resource richness and
relative safety or danger of the productive and reproductive ecology. Such risky and
stressful environments indicated by poorer overall sleep should result in faster life history
strategies, as measured by variations in impulsivity inclinations by particular domains of
higher urgency and sensation seeking and lower premeditation and perseverance.
Firefighters exhibit highly variable fluctuations in sleep patterns resulting from random
waking events due to unpredictable calls that require decisions and action related to
emergencies and fire-related events. Thus, firefighters are a good study population for
sleep-related research because external measures of ecological risk, such as call volumes
and quantity and quality of sleep, vary unpredictably.
Materials and Methods
Participants and Location
Research was conducted among fire personnel at the CAL FIRE- Riverside Unit
and Riverside County Fire Department. It is located in inland Southern California and
houses over 1,600 employees, primarily represented by career emergency response fire
personnel. This Unit defends approximately 7,300 square miles of land serving over 2.1
million residents. In 2009, the Unit responded to 115,718 emergency calls, representing one
of the largest total call volumes in California. The vast expanse of Riverside County
includes mountainous, desert, rural and densely populated towns and cities.
Personnel at each of the Unit's 91 locations are trained to respond to a wide variety
of emergency situations, including: structure fires, medical aids, traffic collisions, rescues,
false alarms, and hazardous materials. In addition to local emergency call response,
personnel are responsible for responding to major wildfire incidents throughout the entire
State.
Sleep ecologies vary greatly across the Unit by individual station. This is due to
station-specific variance in the number of assigned personnel, call type frequencies and
overall call volume. Furthermore, each station has different sleeping arrangements where
rest occurs in either open-barrack, semi-private barrack, or solitary sleep rooms. Sleep
room acoustics, other distractions from room sharing, bed comfort levels, and room
temperatures also differ.

Although most firefighters in the Unit have fixed weekly shifts, some variation
exists. Typical shifts commence at 8:00 am and are 72 hours long, creating susceptibility to
variable nighttime wakeful events for several consecutive nights. It is most common that a
single crew, specializing in different call responses such as those in wildland firefighting,
structure fires, or those with a paramedic on crew for medical calls, are responsible for
responding to all calls specific to their training during both the day and night. Some
stations, however, sleep more than one crew, and since nighttime alarms and dispatch
information are heard station-wide, sleep interruptions can occur even for those who are not
called for response.
Researchers were escorted by Battalion Chiefs to fire stations over a period of five
weeks during June and July 2010 where on-shift personnel were invited to participate in a
"sleep study" as part of a larger life history project. Most frequently, three men were on-
shift per station during the time of station visits by the researchers. Because participation
was limited by firefighters on-shift during the time in which researchers were visiting
randomly selected fire stations, firefighters working longer overtime shifts may have been
more likely to be sampled. Data analysis indicates, however, that 78% of respondents were
within the normal limits of a three night working shift. Willing participants (n = 115) were
instructed to log onto an online survey and answer a series of online questionnaires,
including demographics, the Brief UPPS Impulsive Behaviors Scale (Keye, Wilhelm, and
Oberauer, 2009), and an occupationally targeted sleep survey that included questions
regarding quantity and quality of average sleep at the station. Data on call volume and call
type frequency by station were provided by the Riverside Unit Emergency Command
Center for their use as proxies for environmental stress and, by extension, environmental
quality.
Dependent Impulsivity Measure
Keye and colleagues' (2009) Brief UPPS impulsivity scale was adapted from the
larger UPPS developed by Whiteside and Lynam (2001), which is derived from the Five
Factor Model (FFM) of personality inventory (NEO-PI-R) (Costa and McCrae, 1992). The
scale includes four distinct components: urgency, perseverance (lack of), premeditation
(lack of) and sensation seeking. Urgency, the most understudied component, provides
motivation to emotionally "alleviate" negative emotions and affect regardless of long-term
consequences (Whiteside and Lynam, 2001). Lack of perseverance is defined as remaining
on task to complete a project, regardless of its mundane nature or level of difficulty. Lack
of premeditation describes a situation in which an individual acts with disregarded
forethought to the consequences of a behavior. The last dimension, sensation seeking, is a
measure of excitement and dangerous, risky activity seeking. These components suggest
that impulsivity is more complex than one singular concept, but also suggests the
possibility that traditional scientific uses of impulsivity may need to be broken down into
their components in order to better understand their individual evolutionary significance.
Independent Sleep Variables
Predictors included one sleep quantity variable: 1). Self-reported average number of
minutes slept per night; and three measures of sleep quality: 2). Psychological related
Sleep, impulsivity, and life history

insomnia; 3). Physical pain (health) related insomnia; and 4). A sleep disorder frequency
score. These were gathered via self-report, online surveys.
Two composite variables are designed to represent different aspects of sleep quality.
Psychological sleep quality is measured by questions designed to gauge firefighter's
inability to sleep due to worry, bad dreams and difficulty falling asleep. Physical sleep
quality is measured by health related reasons for insomnia, such as inability to sleep due to
being too hot, snoring, pain, difficulty breathing, and a general low overall satisfaction of
sleep. An increased score in these variables indicate higher sleep quality from less
psychological or pain related insomnia. The sleep disorder quality measure is an additive
score of the number of each participant's medically diagnosed sleep disorders.
Results
Multiple linear regression in STATA v 10 was used to test the hypotheses that sleep
quantity and quality are inversely related to impulsivity. Descriptive statistics of the sample
and dependent sleep variables can be observed in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

The Brief UPPS impulsivity instrument differentiates between four distinct
conceptual variables that were used in analysis: urgency, perseverance, premeditation and
sensation seeking. The four independent predictors of sleep quantity and quality were: 1.)
The number of minutes slept on average per night at the station, 2.) Insomnia due to
psychological worry, 3.) Insomnia due to physical pain, and 3.) The frequency of
diagnosed sleep disorders. Control variables for the full model included number of
biological children, number of years on the job, age, and the average number of station
calls per night, which approximates unpredictable events of ecological stress and risk.
Diagnostic analysis of each model indicates the models did not diverge from the
assumptions of multiple linear regression. The full regression models including all
predictors on the four measures of impulsivity can be found in Table 3. The additive
Sleep, impulsivity, and life history

composite sleep quality variable measuring psychological worry insomnia is composed of
three Likert scale questions regarding the intensity of insomnia related to worrying at night,
difficulty staying asleep and bad dreams. Of particular note, lower likert values signify
lower sleep quality whether by insomnia from psychological worry or physical pain.
Regression analysis indicates that greater psychological worry insomnia results in
higher urgency among firefighters ( = -.60, p = .001). This effect on urgency, however, is
not seen with the other measures of sleep quantity or quality when all predictors and
controls are used within the same model. However, physical pain related insomnia is
predictive of higher urgency in independent analysis without concurrent psychological
insomnia in the model ( = -.41, p = .005). Because of this result, and the fact that
psychological and pain related insomnia are highly correlated (r = .464, p = .000), a formal
detection tolerance test, otherwise known as variance inflation factor (VIF), was run to test
for multicollinearity in Table 3, model 1. The VIF (1.74) did not deviate from regression
analysis assumptions, indicating an unlikely multicollinearity issue in the model between
psychological and physical pain sleep deprivation and all other variables. As an additional
precaution test for multicollinearity, variables were mean-centered, which did not improve
or significantly change model results. Therefore, insomnia from psychological worry
accounts for more of the variance in urgency than does insomnia from physical pain.
Perseverance was not directly associated with sleep but it does have some possible
relationship with extrinsic ecological risk as measured by nightly call volume. For example,
although perseverance was not related to any measure of sleep quantity or quality in the full
model, Table 3, model 2 illustrates a marginal relationship between perseverance and
average number of nighttime emergency calls. In independent regression analysis, while
holding average number of minutes slept per night constant, the number of nighttime
waking response calls marginally increases perseverance ( = .41, p = .090), which is
opposite of predicted theory. Similarly, when running each sleep quality measure in
independent regression analysis, without other criterion variables and using the same
control variables, models indicate a positive relationship with call volume and greater sleep
quality as measured by lower psychological worry insomnia, ( = .43, p = .007); physical
pain insomnia, ( = .47, p = .052); and sleep disorder frequency, ( = .46, p = .053).
More sleep per night results in higher premeditation ( = .01, p = .015). Conversely,
those with more sleep disorders show marginally lower premeditation ( = -1.03, p = .093).
While poorer sleep quality and quantity reduce premeditation as predicted, the number of
nighttime calls, a measure of extrinsic risk, is associated with higher premeditation ( =
.51, p = .030).
Sensation seeking, the final of the four impulsivity scale variables, was not directly
related to any of the sleep variables in multiple regression analysis in the presence of the
control variable of biological children. As such, having children strongly buffers against
sensation seeking impulsive behavior. However, this finding is consistent with theory when
running separate model analyses of each criterion variable in the presence of the same
controls independent with both number of minutes slept ( = -.88, p = .024) and all three of
the quality of sleep measures (psychological worry,  = -.82, p = .041; physical pain,  = -
.86, p = .041; sleep disorders,  = -.77, p = .031).

Discussion
Sleep is an anabolic state of body maintenance and rejuvenation that is essential to
optimal functioning. Waking exists to solve the challenges of production and reproduction,
generally catabolic activities. A fundamental tradeoff therefore exists between the waking
and sleeping states. Individuals should only tradeoff sleep quantity or quality in the
presence of particular ecological constraints requiring greater investment in production and
reproduction. Such ecological circumstances may involve social stress, resource depletion
or high extrinsic risk. Life history theory consequently predicts that in the presence of lack
of sleep or low quality sleep individuals should exhibit faster life history traits. One way
this may be indicated is through impulsive behavior, related to future discounting. The
Brief UPPS survey instrument was chosen because it encompasses more than sensation
seeking in testing impulsivity, specifically adding dimensions of perseverance,
premeditation and urgency. Analysis revealed that there were several observed
relationships between sleep quantity or quality variables, including the presence of an
independent measure of extrinsic risk (call volume), and the outcome impulsivity measures.
Urgency, derived from the neuroticism trait of the FFM, has been argued as a
component of impulsivity intended to mediate negative emotions. However, while the
UPPS uses questions designed to measure urgency, premeditation, perseverance and
sensation seeking, it should be noted that other studies on impulsivity rarely directly
measure or evaluate the psychological components of urgency and perseverance. These
data support that sleep quality, as measured by insomnia resulting from psychological
worry, increases urgent tendencies. Thus, individuals having a difficult time falling asleep
or frequently waking due to excessive worrying are more likely to behave urgently. If this
is indeed a component of impulsivity, it would indicate that social and ecological stress,
translated into nighttime sleep deprivation, causes one to overestimate the time costs of
waiting before acting, and instead preferring to act more urgently, which is in line with life
history theory predictions.
Low sleep quantity and quality measures did not predict changes to perseverance in
the full model. Since it is possible that correlational effects between the sleep variables and
emergency call volume could make interpretation of independent variable effects in the
main model difficult, independent regression analysis was done on each sleep outcome
individually to better assess the possible effects of the extrinsic risk factor of call volume.
These results highlight some marginal and significant relationships between the effects of
the number of emergency calls on perseverance when combined with each sleep measure in
separate regression analyses. In all cases, perseverance was positively affected by
emergency call volume. This, of course, is opposite of predictions and is addressed further
in light of similar premeditation outcomes.
As predicted, getting more sleep is significantly associated with higher
premeditation. Evolutionary insight predicts that it is too costly to premeditate in the
presence of risky, hazardous or perilous circumstances requiring immediate action. As a
consequence, careful forethought preparations are forgone in favor of instant action to
secure immediate survival in the presence of sleep deprivation amongst firefighters.
Interestingly and also contrary to predictions, as was similarly found with perseverance,
Sleep, impulsivity, and life history
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -182-
higher emergency call volume was associated with higher premeditation scores. This
highlights a consistent finding, which is that persistent exposure to greater extrinsic risk, as
measured by call volume, results in both higher premeditation and higher perseverance.
With respect to premeditation, the results indicate that both the number of minutes slept
and call volume independently predict greater premeditation, both in the positive direction.
There may be several interpretations of the contrary results of call volume effects
on perseverance and premeditation. Firefighters may habituate to risky, dangerous
ecologies and adjust to high premeditation and perseverance in those circumstances where
doing so saves their lives. Alternatively, this result could simply be a measure of intrinsic
conscientious motivation of individuals, which may vary considerably by personality type
in the presence of extrinsic risk or lack of sleep.
Understanding the exact nature of the reason for the sleep deprivation though is
essential to predicting either a lack of perseverance or premeditation. This might imply that
perseverance and premeditation are measuring something other than, or may not be
components of, impulsivity. For example, a high perseverance score generally refers to
sticking with a task to completion. The meaning of a low score is less clear, though it may
correlate to multitasking. Evolutionary ecological theory may predict circumstances where
sleep loss due to different reasons may actually result in multi-tasking (or frequent task
switching) versus task focusing, independent of impulsivity. Indeed, the ability to ignore
extraneous circumstances in order to achieve end goals to the exclusion of tangential tasks
would be expected of most people in dangerous circumstances, and therefore perseverance
may not always have the expected inverse relationship with urgency.
Such a reexamination of this variable, given evolutionary theory, may require
reinterpretation of general hypotheses. For example, dangerous environments, requiring
one to focus on the task at hand to the exclusion of other distractions, would predict higher
perseverance scores in the presence of greater emergency call volumes, but insomnia due to
psychological worry may not necessarily be so predicted. Data analysis, however, offers no
support that the number of years on the job increases perseverance independent of all
predictor variables, but holding all control variables constant, either in ( = -.03, p = .657)
or apart from ( = -.04, p = .585) the number of nightly calls, therefore it appears that the
circumstance of why one loses sleep is a key to understanding perseverance and that
habituation might not be the answer. And although the number of years on the job may not
result in habituation, residing at a station with higher call volumes does have some effect.
For example, when the number of emergency awakening events is higher for
firefighters, premeditation increases. This supposes that premeditation becomes
increasingly important for immediate survival when repeated risk is in the environment,
queuing alternative behavioral strategies. Since sleep deprivation has been shown to
decrease executive functioning in a variety of ways across the life course, repeated
exposure to risk in the presence of compromised sleep during one nighttime sleep event
requires a strategy to mediate compensated executive function as a buffer for an
individual's safety. Response time during transportation to emergency events offers time to
invest in preparation and premeditation for forthcoming emergencies. Increased
premeditation becomes especially critical as repeated exposure to danger is experienced
during the night, or it may be that extreme levels of risk select for premeditation.
Sleep, impulsivity, and life history
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -183-
The lack of any significant relationship between sleep variables and sensation
seeking was surprising in the context of life history theory; the only important variable in
this analysis being the control variable of biological children. It could be that sleep has no
effect on one's inclination to seek out sensations, which is unlikely. One important factor is
that these data are restricted to men who tend to self-select into high risk jobs that appeal
best to individuals that are already at the high end of sensation seeking, thus making it
difficult to pick up sample variation if the sensation-seeking variable is very narrow. Or,
the answer may lie in the nature of the typical questions used to assess inclination for
sensation seeking. For instance, one firefighter commented after taking the survey, "Why
would I want to go skydiving? I risk my life every day for this job!" Clearly, however,
number of biological children is an extremely important component of impulsivity with
respect to sensation seeking, indicating that any studies attempting to look for sleep effects
on risk inclination must control for this powerfully predictive variable.
No age effects on impulsivity components were observed. This is contrary to
previous work, particularly in the area of sensation seeking. This analysis, however, is
more finely tuned to pick up evolutionary effects than some of these other studies, because
a control is used for the number of children, which is known to dampen risk inclination
because of the costs to offspring quality. Since both age and biological children are in the
model, when either is significant it is almost always biological children, because the real
theoretical reason that age is significant in previous studies is because it correlates strongly
with having biological children. Still, the number of biological children is clearly the more
important of the two variables, given theory and outcomes. Consequently, future studies
should pay greater attention to this control variable.
In conclusion, impulsivity components are variably associated with environmental
uncertainty. Nightly average sleep acquisition signals environmental certainty, and
individual firefighter behavioral strategies alter according to variations in time spent asleep
and the quality of sleep one is able to achieve. As predicted by life history theory, lack of
sleep minutes resulted in increased impulsivity, specifically in the lack of premeditation.
Reduced insomnia from psychological-related worry buffers against urgent impulse. And
fewer diagnosed sleep disorders improve premeditation. Thus, better sleep quality in these
measures suggests a decrease in impulsive strategies for on-shift firefighters. Finally, as a
corollary to this, better and more sleep aligns with a slower life history strategy.
