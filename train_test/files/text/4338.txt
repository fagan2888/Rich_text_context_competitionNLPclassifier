Abstract: Two independent samples of students were asked to allocate fictional
lotteries of varying dollar amounts to their blood relatives. In both studies, a reliable
genetic relatedness by lineage interaction emerged, such that the genetic effect was a
more positive predictor of percent of money allocated for relatives of a direct lineage
(e.g., parents, grandparents) than it was for peripheral relatives (e.g., siblings, aunts
and uncles). In a third study, this interaction was replicated in an archival analysis of
wills. The implications of accounting for differences in relatives' lineages in studies
of kin investment are discussed.

Introduction
By analyzing the inheritance patterns of 1,000 British Columbian wills,
Smith, Kish, and Crawford (1987) found that deceased benefactors allocated the
greatest percentage of their estates to their closest genetic relatives, a lesser
percentage to their relatives of lesser genetic relatedness, and gave the least to non-
kin and organizations. This pattern of resource allocation is what would be expected
given Hamilton's (1964) inclusive fitness theory. In a similar study, Judge and Hrdy
(1992) examined over 1,500 inheritances from Sacramento, California over the
course of a century (1890-1984). They found the same basic pattern predicted
Hamilton (1964) and demonstrated by Smith et al. (1987): On average, benefactors
gave a greater percentage of their estates to kin of closer genetic relatedness than
more distantly related kin and non-kin.
According to inclusive fitness theory, factors such as genetic relatedness and
differential fertility (which is related to sex and age) should explain the majority of
variation in inheritances within families (Hamilton, 1964; Judge and Hrdy, 1992;
Human Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage
Smith et al., 1987). However, genetic relatives can be further divided into two distinct
categories based on whether or not they share a direct lineage to the benefactor or
target individual. Relatives of a direct lineage are those who are direct descendents or
progenitors of the target individual (e.g., grandparents, parents, children,
grandchildren), whereas peripheral relatives refer to those who are genetically related
to the target, but are neither direct descendents nor progenitors of the target (e.g.,
siblings, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, cousins).
Although inclusive fitness theory would predict that resources would be
allocated equally among kin of the same genetic relatedness, sex, and age, previous
investigations of wills (e.g., Smith et al., 1987) suggest that the genetic relatedness
effect is stronger among relatives of direct lineage than it is for peripheral relatives
(see Figure 1). Although Smith et al. (1987) did not consider lineage differences as an
independent variable, the pattern of estate allocations observed in their archival
analysis of wills is suggestive of a substantial genetic relatedness by lineage
interaction. Why should the genetic relatedness effect be stronger for direct lineages
than it is for peripheral lineages? There are at least four possible explanations.

Human Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage
First, age differences, which were not statistically controlled in Smith et al.'s
data, could be driving the interaction, since relatives of equal genetic relatedness--
but different lineages--typically differ in age (e.g., daughters vs. sisters,
granddaughters vs. nieces). Since age is inversely related to fertility, age differences
could partially account for the pattern of means in Figure 1.
Second, there are strong cultural and historical norms that may influence
people's inheritance decisions. Although there is substantial amount of variability in
inheritances of titles and property within and between cultures over time (Cooper,
1976; Goody, 1983; Le Roy Ladurie, 1976; Radcliffe-Brown, 1950), in many modern
Western cultures, people tend to will a larger percentage of their estates to their direct
descendants than to their peripheral relatives.
Third, it is possible that favoritism toward relatives of direct lineage results
from differences in bonding and competition early in development. For example,
perhaps the parent-child and child-parent patterns of attachment are stronger than
sibling-sibling attachment patterns (Bowlby, 1969). It is also possible that parent-
offspring conflict is more subdued than sibling-sibling conflict when children
compete for limited resources (Trivers, 1974).
Fourth, the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction may be associated with
individuals' perceptions of relatedness uncertainty. For example, the certainty that a
child is one's own may be greater than the certainty that one's sibling is a full or half
sibling (particularly among females who are can be certain that their child is their
own). For instance, equating relatives on age and sex, it would be more conservative
for a woman to invest in two of her children than it would be to invest in her two
siblings, given that she cannot be entirely certain if her siblings are full or half
siblings, due to paternal uncertainty. Given this fact, over evolutionary time, a
resource sharing preference that favored relatives of direct lineage could be beneficial
in the context of an individual's inclusive fitness.
Overview of the Present Studies
The purpose of the present studies was to assess the strength of the genetic
relatedness by lineage interaction using a survey method (Study 1), to replicate this
effect in a subsequent survey study (Study 2), and to observe this effect in actual
inheritances (Study 3). In Studies 1 and 2, college students were asked to allocate
various fictional lotteries to as many genetic relatives as they wished. In Study 3, the
inheritance patterns in a sample of archived wills were analyzed, taking into account
differences in lineage between benefactors and their beneficiaries. Across all studies,
it was predicted that the effect relatives' genetic relatedness on resource allocations
would depend on relatives' lineage to the target individual, such that the genetic
relatedness effect would be more positive for relatives of direct lineage to the target
than it would be for peripheral relatives.

Study 1: Exploration
Method
Participants. Participants were 133 students (57% males) enrolled in an
introductory psychology course at a southern state university and received course
credit in return for their participation. This sample originally consisted of 147
students. The 14 excluded participants were nine who failed to list the ages of any of
their relatives, four who allocated their entire lotteries to a single relative, and one
who indicated that he or she was adopted.
Materials and Procedure. Participants were instructed to allocate a fictional
lottery prize of varying dollar amounts to their blood relatives. Each participant was
randomly assigned one of three lottery amounts to allocate: US$10,000, US$100,000,
or US$1,000,000. Participants were instructed to imagine that they had won one of
the three lottery amounts, but that only their blood relatives would be allowed to keep
the prize money. Thus, participants were asked to allocate the entire lottery to as
many (or as few) relatives as they saw fit, and were allowed to allocate any amount
they desired to each relative, so long as the entire lottery was allocated across the set
of relatives they chose to list. Participants were asked specifically to list blood
relatives (i.e., no step-parents or in-laws). The back side of the instructions served as
the response sheet, where participants were asked to list each relative's (a) specific
relation to them (e.g., "father's sister" instead of "aunt,"), (b) sex (if not obvious), (c)
age in years (or approximate age if unknown), (d) allocated lottery amount in dollars.
Following these procedures, students were debriefed on the purpose of the research
and thanked for their participation.
Data Analysis. Preliminary analyses within each of the present three studies
revealed evidence of neither a sex-of-relative difference in allocations nor a sex-of-
participant difference in any of the effects of interest (ps > .06). In other words,
participant sex moderated neither the main effects of genetic relatedness or lineage,
nor their interaction. Thus, all subsequent analyses were run collapsing across male
and female relatives and participants.
The data obtained from all three studies yielded a hierarchically nested data
structure, with relatives nested within families. Whereas previous studies have
ignored problems with statistical dependency in using relatives as the sole unit of
analysis (e.g., Smith et al., 1987), the present data were modeled using a more
appropriate mixed model in the form of a multilevel random coefficient model
(MRCM) in the context of the program Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM, Version
5; Raudenbush, Bryk, Cheong, and Congdon, 2000). This procedure involved
performing within-participant regressions and then modeling the resulting within-
participant regression coefficients as a function of between-participant variables. In
MRCM terms, this involved modeling within-participant (or within-family) variance
at Level 1 and between-participant (or between-family) variance at Level 2 (see
Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002).

Human Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage
For the present data, within-participant regression coefficients were estimated
predicting percent of money allocated from each relative's genetic relatedness,
lineage, and their interaction, controlling for relative's age. Thus, the design of the
within-person model was the regression analog of a 2 (genetic relatedness: r = .25 vs.
r = .50)  2 (lineage: direct vs. peripheral) analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with
relative's age in years (mean-deviated at the within-person level) as a covariate:
PERCENTij

+ 1j
(AGE)ij
+ 2j
(RELATEDNESS)ij
+ 3j
(LINEAGE)ij
+
4j
(RELATEDNESS x LINEAGE)ij
+ rij
.
In this model, PERCENTij
represents the percent of the lottery money allocated by
participant j to relative i and 0j
is the random coefficient representing the mean
Percent for family j across i relatives for which the participant listed. The coefficients
1j
through 4j
represent within-person slopes (or difference scores). The variance of
rij
is the within-person error variance.
Multilevel models allow for regression coefficients from one level of analysis
(Level 1) to be modeled at another level (Level 2). For these data, this meant that the
within-participant (or within-family) relationships were modeled as functions of
between-participant (or between-family) variables. At level 2, the resulting within-
participant regression coefficients from Level 1 were modeled as s function of
between-participant differences in lottery amount (or estate amounts in Study 3).
Thus, for Study 1, the Level-2 design for the between-participant model was the
regression analog of a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), which compared the
two polynomial effects codes for the three lottery amounts:

In the between-family model, 0j
and 1j
through 4j
represent the within-person
intercepts and slopes, respectively. The .0
s represent the means of their respective
within-person regression coefficients, controlling for the aforementioned between-
person effects. These are the effects that are of particular interest in the present
research. For example, the strength of the 40
coefficient addresses the central
question, "Does the effect of genetic relatedness on lottery allocations depend on
differences in relatives' lineage on average across families, controlling for age
differences between relatives and controlling differences in lottery amount between
participants?" Lastly, the u.j
s represent the errors of their respective .j
s, and their
variances are the family-level error variances.

Results and Discussion
The effect of genetic relatedness was a strong and reliable predictor of percent
of money allocated, with first-order relatives receiving substantially more of the
lottery than second-order relatives (see Table 1, left columns, for regression
statistics). Lineage was also a strong predictor, with direct lineage relatives receiving
a greater share of the lottery than peripheral relatives. However, these main effects
were qualified by a reliable relatedness by lineage interaction, such that the genetic
relatedness effect on percent of money allocated was stronger and more positive
among relatives of direct lineage than it was among peripheral relatives (see Figure
2). Note that the predicted mean percentages of resources allocated in the figures do
not sum to 100%. This is because (a) allocations made to distal relatives (e.g., r =
.125) were excluded from analyses because there was no linage variation (i.e., none
were of direct lineage) and (b) the mean percentages represent within-family means
that were subsequently averaged across families. Simple effects within the context of
this interaction revealed that the genetic relatedness slopes within relatives of direct
lineage and within peripheral relatives were each significantly greater than zero (ps <
.01). Lastly, none of the within-participant slopes were moderated by the between-
participant lottery differences (ps > .10).

These results supported the main hypotheses: The relatedness effect was
stronger for relatives of direct lineage than it was for peripheral relatives, even when
age of relative (which is related to reproductive potential) was statistically held
constant. The pattern of means observed in the present study was similar to the
pattern reported in previous archival analyses of inheritances (e.g., Smith et al.,
1987). This result suggested that the resource sharing patterns reported by younger
students were similar to the inheritances specified by older adults in their wills.

Study 2: Replication
Although the results of Study 1 clearly supported the hypothesis, the findings
were unique in that the effect of lineage and its interaction with genetic relatedness
had heretofore never been assessed in an empirical study of within-family resource
allocation. To see if these effects were replicable, a second study was conducted
using an independent sample of students at a different university. Furthermore, if
theses effects were as robust as Study 1 had suggested, they should be replicable in a
small sample.

Method
Participants. Participants were 28 students (39% males) enrolled in an upper-
level psychology course at a western state university and received no compensation
for their participation. This sample originally consisted of 35 students. The three
excluded participants were two who indicated that they were adopted and one whose
regression residual constituted a statistical outlier relative to the rest of the sample.
Materials and Procedure. The procedure and materials used in Study 2 were
identical to those used in Study 1, but with one exception: Only two fictional lottery
amounts were randomly assigned to participants: US$10,000 and US$100,000.
Data Analysis. The model employed in Study 2 was identical to that
employed in Study 1, but with one exception: Only a single contrast-coded variable
was necessary to model differences in lottery amounts, as this variable had only two
levels in Study 2, whereas this variable had an additional level in Study 1 (i.e.,
US$1,000,000).
Results and Discussion
The results of Study 2 replicated those of Study 1 (see Table 1, middle
columns). Once again, first-order relatives received a greater share of the lottery than
second-order relatives. Replicating the lineage effect, relatives of direct lineage to the
target were allotted greater amounts of money than peripheral relatives. Moreover,
the relatedness by lineage interaction was replicated in the same direction as Study 1,
with the genetic relatedness effect being a stronger and more positive predictor
among relatives of direct lineage than it was among peripheral relatives (see Figure
3). Simple effects in the context of this interaction revealed that the genetic
relatedness slope was significantly different from zero for direct lineage relatives (p <
.01), but not for peripheral relatives (p > .50). None of the within-participant effects
were reliably moderated by between-participant differences in lottery amounts (ps >
.05).
Study 3: Application
Although Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the moderating effect of lineage
differences on the relationship between genetic relatedness and lottery allocation
within families, they lacked ecological validity. Specifically, it was not clear whether
younger students allocating fictional prize money accurately reflected how older
people might actually distribute their estates in wills. To this end, an archival analysis
of probated wills was undertaken to support the findings of Studies 1 and 2, and to
replicate the patterns of means found in previous archival research (e.g., Smith et al.
1987).

Method
Sample and Procedure. The analyzed sample consisted of the wills of 74
people (62% males) probated in British Columbia in 1954. This sample originally
consisted of 191 records. The 117 excluded cases were 67 persons who died intestate,
39 who listed no blood relatives, six whose estates amounted to less than Can$1, four
whose estates were not quantifiable into dollar amounts, and one whose estate
exceeded Can$200,000 (a positive outlier in this sample). The year 1954 was chosen
by randomly selecting two adjacent microfilm rolls from a randomly selected file
cabinet. Wills were obtained from the British Columbia Archives in Victoria and
selected by the order in which they were probated on two microfilm rolls. This
population and sampling method were similar to those used by Smith et al. (1987).
The median estate was valued at Can$7,321 (the range was 497 to 89,773). Due to the
extreme positive skew of the distribution of estate amounts, and to make these
amounts comparable to those of Studies 1 and 2, a log10
transformation was
performed. The mean log-transformed estate value was 3.92 (SD = 0.53).
Data Analysis. A MRCM was employed, with related beneficiaries nested
within families (or target individuals). The Level-1 model was identical to those

presented in Studies 1 and 2, with one exception: Because the actual ages of relatives
were not available, ages were estimated by determining what generation the relatives
were relative to the target. For example, a mother, sister, daughter, and granddaughter
were considered first, second, third, and fourth generation, respectively. These
generational distinctions were given a linear coding to reflect categorical age
differences (i.e., 3, 1, ­1, and ­3, respectively). At level 2, log estate amounts were
entered as a predictor of the resulting within-family (Level 1) regression coefficients.
Results and Discussion
Neither a reliable genetic relatedness difference nor a lineage difference was
detected in these data (see Table 1, right columns). However, a reliable genetic
relatedness by lineage interaction did emerge (see Figure 4).

This interaction was in the same direction as Studies 1 and 2 and in the
direction suggested--but not tested--by previous researchers (e.g., Smith et al.
1987). Tests of simple effects in the context of this interaction indicated that neither
the positive genetic relatedness slope within relatives of direct lineage (p = .15) nor

Human Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage
the negative genetic relatedness slope within peripheral relatives (p = .29) differed
significantly from zero. None of the within-family effects were moderated by
between-person differences in the log estate amounts (ps > .50).
These results from the archived wills suggested that the genetic relatedness by
lineage interaction was as reliable in real inheritances as it was across two survey
studies using college students. Once again, the effect of genetic relatedness on
resource allocations was dependent on the lineage of the relative in question.
Specifically, the simple relationship between genetic relatedness and allocations of
estate amounts was significantly more positive among relatives of a direct lineage
than it was among peripheral relatives.
General Discussion
Across two surveys and an archival analysis, the predicted pattern was
supported: the extent to which people allocated their resources to kin as a function of
their common genes was more positive for relatives of a direct lineage than for other
relatives. Across the three studies presented here, this interaction was robust--even
when statistically controlling for differences in relatives' ages and differences in
amounts of resources to be allocated. This interaction suggests that accounting for
differences in relatives' lineages is important to understanding resources sharing
within families.
Although these studies were the first to statistically demonstrate the genetic
relatedness by lineage interaction in inheritances, they do not explain the mechanism
behind this interaction. In the introduction, four possible explanations were given: (a)
age-of-relative differences, (b) cultural norms, (c) sibling-sibling competition is
stronger than parent-child competition, and (d) relatedness uncertainty. The only
explanation that the present research rules out is that of relatives' age differences,
which were controlled in all analyses. As for cultural norms, the present research is
only generalizable to upper-middle class North Americans, typically of European
descent. To evaluate the roll culture plays in the strength of the genetic relatedness by
lineage interaction, other cultures--particularly non-Western ones--will need to be
investigated.
To assess the possibility that differences in within-family competition for
resources could be driving the observed interaction, future research could measure
variables relating to sibling-sibling closeness, amount of overlap in years of
cohabitation, and socio-economic status of the family. If differences in within-family
competition are indeed driving the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction, one
would expect the interaction to be stronger as measures of sibling-sibling competition
for resources increase.
It is also possible that the genetic relatedness by lineage interaction is related
to differences in genetic relatedness stemming from paternal uncertainty within
families. Women (but not necessarily men) can be certain that their offspring is
indeed their own. Because of paternal uncertainty, however, neither men nor women

Human Kin Investment as a Function of Genetic Relatedness and Lineage
can be certain that their brothers and sisters are full or half siblings. Thus, over
evolutionary time, individuals who invested more resources in relatives of greater
certainty (i.e., direct lineages) than relatives of lesser certainty (i.e., peripheral
lineages), were more likely to pass on more of their common genes to future
generations, thus perpetuating favoritism towards direct descendants.
Limitations and Implications
One possible limitation of these studies is the ecological validity of having
college students allocate fictional lotteries to their relatives in Studies 1 and 2.
Specifically, it was not clear if using a survey method with younger participants
would accurately reflect the allocation patterns employed by older people when
writing their wills. However, the results of an archival analysis of actual inheritance
patterns in Study 3 replicated the pattern of findings present in the first two studies. In
addition, the three studies presented here reflect the results of previous archival
research on large samples of wills (Judge and Hrdy, 1992; Smith et al., 1987).
Moreover, this survey method has been used successfully to investigate other kin
investment issues in a related study (cf. Webster, 2003). Thus, it appears that younger
people faced with a resource allocation task allocate resources to their kin in much
the same way that older people do when they create wills. Although survey methods
are no substitute archival analyses of inheritances, the similarity of the results across
the three studies presented here show convergent validity between the survey and
archival methods. Thus, the use multiple methods to assess patterns of kin investment
should be encouraged in future investigations.
A second possible limitation of the present research is the lack of replication
of the genetic relatedness and lineage main effects in Study 3. There are at least two
factors contributing to these null effects. First, the sample size in Study 3 (N = 74)
was small in comparison to previous analyses of archived wills (Ns > 1,000), which
resulted in relatively low statistical power to detect effects. Second, real-world data
(e.g., archival and field data) are notoriously noisier (i.e., containing more sources of
error variance) than data collected in controlled environments (e.g., in classrooms and
laboratories; McClelland and Judd, 1993). Thus, it is not unusual for archival studies
to show weaker effects than survey studies.
The results of these studies indicate that differences in relative's lineages to a
given target should be accounted for in studies of human kin investment or altruism.
Not only were relatives of a direct lineage favored over other relatives in the two
survey studies, but also this effect determined the extent to which genetic relatedness
was associated with resource allocation in an analysis of archived wills. Because the
simple relationship between genetic relatedness and resource allocation depends on
the lineage of the relative in question, future research should make distinctions
between relatives of direct and peripheral lineages.
