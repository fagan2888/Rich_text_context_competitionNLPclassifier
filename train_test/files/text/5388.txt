Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) continues to be a significant
public health problem in the world, manifested by high lev-
els of mortality and disability, and exerting undue financial
burden on governments and individuals in terms of treatment
costs and lost manpower. This burden is felt most acutely by
developing countries, which in addition to having the least
resources have a disproportionately high prevalence of TBIs
primarily due to the substantially higher incidence of road
traffic accidents in those countries. As one of the rapidly
developing nations in Africa, Kenya has a significantly high
rate of traffic-related deaths and disabilities most of which
result from brain injuries. Although there are no accurate
numbers available on the prevalence of TBIs in Kenya, the
high frequency of motor vehicle­related injuries and fatali-
ties, and the numbers mentioned in the articles reviewed for
this article, point to a high occurrence of brain injuries in the
country.
Broadly defined, TBI is an insult to the brain caused by an
external physical force or penetration of the skull by a for-
eign object. ATBI is not congenital or degenerative in nature
and is not the result of a disease (Falvo, 2009) or acute ill-
ness. TBI is typically classified as mild, moderate, or severe.
Between 10% and 30% of TBIs are considered moderate and
between 5% and 25% are in the severe category. Severity of
injury is generally determined by Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) ratings immediately following the injury, usually
upon arrival at a treatment facility.
The World Health Organization (WHO; 2011) estimates
that each year more than 10 million people in the world sus-
tain TBIs resulting in death or extensive hospitalization
(Hyder,Wunderlich,Puvanachandra,Gururaj,&Kobusingye,
2007; WHO, 2011) with the survivors often acquiring a per-
manent disability (Roozenbeek, Maas, & Menon, 2013).
Most recent data indicate that TBI is responsible for more
than 4.5 million deaths a year which translates to approxi-
mately one in every 10 deaths in the world. This number is
expected to increase, especially due to the rapidly increasing
rates of TBI in developing countries. The WHO predicts that
by the year 2020, TBI will be the leading cause of mortality
and disability in the world, surpassing chronic diseases and
other current leading causes of death (WHO, 2002). That
increase is expected to be even more pronounced in develop-
ing countries where that trend is already evident. Between
1970 and 2000, the number of road traffic accident deaths in
Africa increased by 35% (El-Gindi, Mahdy, & Abdel Azeem,
2001).
It is for this reason that TBI has often been referred to as
"the silent epidemic" (Langlois, Rutland-Brown, & Ward,

Traumatic Brain Injury in Kenya: A
Preliminary Review of the Literature
Benson Kinyanjui1
Abstract
Kenya has a disproportionately high rate of road traffic accidents each year, many of them resulting in traumatic brain injuries
(TBIs). A review of articles written on issues pertaining to the medical treatment of people with TBI in the past 15 years in
Kenya indicates a significantly high incidence of TBIs and a high mortality rate. This article reviews the available literature
as a first step in exploring the status of rehabilitation of Kenyans with cognitive impairments and other disabilities resulting
from TBIs. From this preliminary review, it is apparent that despite TBI being a pervasive public health problem in Kenya, it
has not received due attention in the public and private sectors as evidenced by a serious lack of post-acute rehabilitation
services for people with TBIs. Implications for this lack of services are discussed and recommendations are made for potential
approaches to this problem.

2006) especially due to the fact that most of its consequences,
especially cognitive impairments, are not obvious. Unlike
physical or sensory disabilities, many people with TBI do not
appear to have a disability. Visible or not, TBI continues to
be a significant public health problem accounting for billions
of dollars in medical expenses and lost manpower every
year. That financial and human capital burden is felt by all
countries, but most profoundly by developing and underde-
veloped countries that have disproportionately higher preva-
lence of TBI.
While there are many causes of TBI, road traffic accidents
are responsible for about 60% of brain injuries in the world
(Hyder et
al., 2007). Globally, road traffic accidents are
responsible for more than 50 million injuries every year, with
about 1.2 million ending in death (Jacobs & Aeron-Thomas,
2012; WHO, 2011). Other causes are falls, which account for
about 25%, and other non-motor-vehicle-related accidents
and acts of violence which collectively account for about
15% of TBIs (Hyder etal., 2007).
Although developing countries have the lowest number of
motor vehicles, they have the highest road traffic accident
mortality rates (Saidi, Mutiso, & Ogengo, 2014). As a conti-
nent, Africa has about 4% of the world's motor vehicles.
However, the number of road traffic accident fatalities on the
continent account for 11% of all motor vehicle related deaths
in the world (Jacobs & Aeron-Thomas, 2012). In contrast,
developed countries, who own 60% of the world's motor
vehicles, account for only 14% of global road traffic accident
fatalities (Saidi etal., 2014).
Over the past 40 years, there has been a significant
decrease in road traffic accident deaths in developed coun-
tries, while in developing countries like Kenya, the opposite
has been true as road traffic accident mortality rates have
increased exponentially (Mwang'ombe & Shitsama, 2013;
Pratte, 1998). Factors attributable to the decline in road traf-
fic accident fatalities in industrialized countries include
implementation of preventive measures (Jennett, 1996),
including mandatory helmet and seat belt laws, rigorous
enforcement of alcohol limits, and enforcement of speed lim-
its by traffic police. In developing countries, the rapid
increase in road traffic accidents and associated deaths is pri-
marily due to driving in excess of the speed limit (Bachani
etal., 2012); lack of, or inadequate enforcement, of traffic
laws (El-Gindi etal., 2001; Pukose, 2007); lack of helmet
laws or of enforcement thereof; driving while intoxicated
(Hassan, Macharia, & Atinga, 2005; Odero, Garner, & Zwi,
1997); operation of unroadworthy vehicles (El-Gindi etal.,
2001); and poor road conditions.
TBI in Kenya
In Kenya, the mortality rate from road traffic accidents has
been increasing every year since independence in 1963
(Bachani etal., 2012). Currently, it is estimated that 3,000
Kenyans die as a result of road traffic accidents every year,
and thousands more are incapacitated, causing huge financial
burdens on their families and on the public health system
(Odero, Khayesi, & Heda, 2003; Saidi etal., 2014). In their
2003 study of road traffic injuries, Odero and his colleagues
found that the mortality rate in Kenya was 68 for every
10,000 registered motor vehicles (Odero etal., 2003), a rate
that is about 40 times greater than in developed countries.
According to a study by Bachani and others in 2012, road
traffic accident­related fatalities in Kenya increased at a rate
of 7% between 2004 and 2009. During that period, the num-
ber of motorcycle-related injuries increased by 29%. Like
others before it, this study revealed that speeding, failure to
use seat belts, and failure to wear helmets and/or reflective
clothing were among the primary contributors to the high
mortality.
As with most developing countries, determining the prev-
alence of TBI in Kenya is, to an extent, a matter of estimation
due to the large number of factors and variables involved
(Hyder etal., 2007). First, there is the epidemiological issue
of the universal tendency to confuse TBI and head injury.
Head injury typically refers to any visible lacerations, abra-
sions, or contusions to the face or skull (Bruns & Hauser,
2003) which may not necessarily result in an injury to the
brain. On the contrary, some brain injuries such as concus-
sions can occur without any visible external injuries. It is
perceivable that many cases of TBI go unreported because
they are recorded as head injury. It also is perceivable that
many cases of mild brain injury, which constitute the major-
ity of TBIs, go unreported (Hyder etal., 2007) and that some
head injuries are reported as TBIs. In the case of Kenya, lan-
guage could be an additional factor as those who transport
accident victims to the hospital may not be fluent in English
and may report the circumstances of the accident in Kiswahili
or any of the other 41 languages, potentially confusing the
words for "brain" and "head" in reference to the victim's
injuries.
In serious accidents in which the victims sustain many
injuries, triage and emergency room treatment typically
focuses on the visible injuries such as fractures or open
wounds; and brain injuries may not be detected until many
days or weeks later. In that case, those TBIs may never make
it into the TBI statistics as they were not reported as a direct
result of the accident. Furthermore, in cases in which the
individual dies at the accident scene, in transit to the hospital,
or upon admission, the death may be attributed to other inju-
ries. Compounding the problem in developing countries such
as Kenya is the lack of evaluative skills among lower level
medical staff, the lack of knowledge regarding assessment
tools such as GCS and Injury Severity Score (ISS), and the
lack of an adequate data documentation and recording sys-
tem (Saidi etal., 2014) especially in rural areas. Therefore,
although some records exist on the prevalence of TBI in
Kenya in particular, and the developing world in general,
they are in most likelihood a gross underestimation of the
true numbers of TBIs that actually occur there.
Kinyanjui 3
In Kenya, the above factors in combination with the sharp
increase in the number of motor vehicles, and in particular
motor cycles (Khanbhai & Lutomia, 2012; Saidi & Mutisto,
2013), have resulted in a significant rise in the number of
road traffic accidents (Osoro, Nganga, Oundo, Omolo, &
Luman, 2011) and consequently in the number of people
who sustain TBI as a result. As stated before, accurate num-
bers on the incidence of TBI are difficult to determine due to
a lack of a centralized national reporting and record keeping
system.
The most recent reliable study on road traffic injuries
rates in Kenya (Bachani etal., 2012) puts the rate at about 60
per 100,000 population. Based on the fact that TBIs are the
single most common consequence of road traffic accidents,
and that TBI accounts for about 50% of all road traffic acci-
dent deaths (Saidi, Macharia, & Atinga, 2005), it is easy to
see, even without exact numbers, that Kenya has a high inci-
dence of TBI. The global prevalence of TBI is estimated at
200 per 100,000 population. However, the rates vary between
countries and regions, ranging from 67 in some developed
countries to 317 in some developing countries. The preva-
lence rate in Kenya remains unknown. However, based on
global rates, prevalence in comparable countries in Africa,
and on the high incidence of road traffic injuries and its high
correlation with TBI, the prevalence is likely to be on the
higher end of the global TBI prevalence.
Literature Review
A review of literature on this participant resulted in very
few articles written on TBI in Kenya. To be precise, only
four articles were published in peer reviewed journals
between 2001 and 2013. The literature search also identi-
fied six articles in the form of unpublished dissertations and
manuscripts almost exclusively written by students and fac-
ulty of the University of Nairobi in the same period.
Although none of the 10 articles include TBI incidence or
prevalence rates, they all allude to a high incidence of TBI
in Kenya. Incidentally, all of the articles are based on stud-
ies or research carried out at Kenyatta National Hospital
(KNH), the teaching hospital for the University of Nairobi,
which is also the largest referral hospital in Kenya. A search
of articles on TBI based on treatment at other medical facil-
ities in Kenya yielded no results.
The most recent is a 2013 article by Wekesa, Ogengo,
Siongei, Elbusaidy, and Iwaret published in the East and
Central African Journal of Surgery, in which the authors dis-
cuss the demographics of participants with traumatic head
injuries at KNH. Wekesa etal. (2013) reiterated the chal-
lenges of determining the epidemiology of TBI in develop-
ing countries such as Kenya due to the scarcity of CT scans,
the main diagnostic tool for TBI, and the issue of polytrauma
injuries and fatalities in which brain injury is often not fac-
tored. They proceeded to present findings of the cross-
sectional study whose specific focus was on patients with
intracranial bleeding resulting from brain trauma. The study
included 51 patients between 4 and 81 years of age, the
majority of whom were male (96%). Other relevant demo-
graphics included that 55% of the participants were married,
57% had elementary (primary) education, 47% were
employed, 35% were alcohol consumers, and 21% were cig-
arette smokers. These demographics are typical of a cross
section of Kenyans and are comparable with the patient
demographics in all other studies reviewed.
Citing other studies, including one done in the United
States in 1994, the authors pointed out the association
between TBI and low social economic status in Kenya. In
addition, they inferred that the level of education is nega-
tively correlated to TBI incidence in that less than 4% of the
TBI patients in their study had tertiary education, as opposed
to 68% who had little or no education. They added that
although 47% of the participants reported being employed,
they were engaged in low paying jobs consistent with their
low academic level (Wekesa etal., 2013). The authors con-
cluded their article by calling for more population-based
studies on TBI to present a clearer picture of the incidence
and impact of TBI in Kenya.
In 2011, Kiboi, Kitunguu,Angwenyi, Mbuthia, and Sagina
conducted a study on the predictors of functional recovery
following TBI involving intracranial hematomas. In their
study, which was published in World Neurosurgery, the
authors started by highlighting the significance of intracranial
hematomas which they describe as the most common clinical
problem encountered by neurosurgeons, and which is associ-
ated with high mortality rates and very poor prognosis among
TBI patients (Kiboi, Kitunguu, Angwenyi, Mbuthia, &
Sagina, 2011). For their study, which was the first to address
that particular medical participant among Kenyan patients,
the authors reviewed records of 608 patients diagnosed with
TBI and admitted at KNH neurosurgical unit between January
and December, 2009. Their review specifically looked for
treatment variables predictive of favorable functional out-
comes. As expected, the majority of the patients were male
(89%), with about 50% of the patients between the ages of 26
and 45. Surprisingly, 48% of the patients had sustained TBI as
a result of assault, with road traffic accident and falls contrib-
uting to the other 51% of the patients.
According to their findings, 46% of the patients achieved
"good functional recovery" (Kiboi etal., 2011) whereas 34%
ended up with moderate or severe disability, which translates
to approximately 231 people. The report did not account for
the remaining 20% of the patients, but based on other stud-
ies, that could be the number that died during treatment. A
significant finding from that study was that patients who sus-
tained TBI from motor vehicle accidents were less likely to
achieve functional recovery than those whose TBI resulted
from falling. From the data, the authors concluded that long
periods between injury and treatment, poor GCS scores,
pupillary abnormalities, and being older than 61 years were
predictive of poor functional recovery.
4 SAGE Open
In an article published in the Annals of African Surgery,
Opondo and Mwangombe (2007) reported that their research
was conducted on 87 patients with TBI admitted at KNH
Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between April and September,
2005. Fifty-eight percent of the patients were involved in
road traffic accidents. The purpose of the research was "to
determine the outcome of severe traumatic brain injury and
to document the factors influencing mortality" (Opondo &
Mwangombe, 2007, p. 1). Precisely, they wanted to look at
the differences in treatment between TBI patients who had
survived and those who had died, to determine what could be
done differently to increase the survival rate. Mortality
among the 87 patients admitted during that 6-month period
was 54%. Among those who survived, 29% were severely
disabled or remained in a persistent vegetative state. From
the study, the authors determined that GCS score of less than
5, diffuse axonal injury, intracerebral lesions, and high blood
sugar were the primary factors influencing poor outcomes.
The oldest journal article identified on this participant
was one written by Mwang'ombe and Kiboi (2001) and pub-
lished in the East African Medical Journal in 2001. This
article describes a study which, like the one by Wekesa and
his colleagues, focused on identifying factors that influence
the outcome of severe TBI at KNH. This was a retrospective
study on the 677 patients who were treated for severe head
injury at KNH between January 1992 and December 1996.
The demographics of the patients in this study were compa-
rable with those in the other two studies, that is, males out-
numbered females, with the majority of the patients being
between 26 and 45 years of age. The study indicated that
56% of the patients died while undergoing treatment. About
38% had moderate to good recovery which in this context
was defined as "resumption of normal life with moderate or
minor neurological or psychological deficits" (Mwang'ombe
& Kiboi, 2001, p. 238). From this study, the authors con-
cluded that age, GCS score, systolic blood pressure, and
pupillary reaction to light were the leading predictors of out-
comes following TBI.
Two of the dissertations found on the participant of TBI in
Kenya focused on institutional structure and practitioner
skills and performance, and how they affect the outcomes of
TBI patients at KNH. The first one, written by Bhoyyo
(2010), was based on a study of the management of patients
with severe TBI at KNH, in particular, the practices of anes-
thesia and neurology practitioners and their adherence to
guidelines established by the Brain Trauma Foundation
(BTF). The study was carried out via a self-administered
questionnaire given to 53 practitioners who worked directly
with head injured patients. According to Bhoyyo, the study
revealed that many of the practitioners did not follow the
protocol of care on a regular basis. For example, only 20% of
the practitioners managed hypotension in TBI patients as
required by BTF. Among the reasons given for failure to
meet the set guidelines were limited staff and resources,
including hospital beds.
The other dissertation, authored by L. W. Macharia
(2013), aimed to "determine the structure and processes that
support quality nursing care for TBI patients" (L. W.
Macharia, 2013). For the study, the author recruited 133 par-
ticipants working in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) and
Accident Emergency (AE) departments at KNH, the major-
ity of whom had at least 5 years experience. From the study,
Macharia found that there was a significant correlation
between nurses' knowledge (skills) and the quality of their
management of TBI patients, especially the prevention of
secondary TBI in the two departments.As in Bhoyyo's study,
the challenges reported by the participants included inade-
quate staff, lack of or shortage of equipment, and lack of
guidelines.
A comprehensive study on cognitive dysfunction among
TBI patients at KNH was conducted by Gachanja (2013) and
reported in an unpublished manuscript. The goal of the study
was to determine the prevalence and extent of cognitive dys-
function using some standard assessment tools including the
Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), the Trails Making Test
(TMT), and the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) Part A and B. partici-
pants in the study were 74 (58 male and 16 female) brain
injured patients with a mean age of 34 years. All participants
were patients in the surgical clinic, neurology department,
and treatment wards at KNH. According to the author's
report, 24 patients (32%) indicated moderate to severe cogni-
tive impairment according to their MMSE results. Part A of
the TMT revealed moderate or severe cognitive impairment
in 27 (36%) of the patients, while Part B indicated moderate
or severe cognitive impairment in 37 of the patients (50%).
Fifty-eight percent of the patients were ranked as moderately
or severely cognitively impaired by the RBANS. That study
reported significant association between cognitive impair-
ment and age, education level, and socioeconomic status. In
her conclusion, based on the study, the author recommended
clinical screening and cognitive rehabilitation of TBI patients
to improve their quality of life.
An unpublished manuscript by Wafula (2010) addressed
the age factor in the early outcomes of TBI. Based on a study
on 67 patients (67% adults and 33% children) with severe
head injury at KNH, the study found that children ages 3 to 5
were the majority in the pediatric group. Poor outcomes
(mortality) were associated with patients at the extremes of
the age spectrum, that is, the youngest and the oldest. One of
the important findings in Wafula's study was that children
had significantly fewer poor outcomes than adults with simi-
lar GCS scores, suggesting a higher rate of survival among
severely head injured children than adults. However, in an
overall, study-wide comparison between outcomes of chil-
dren and those of adults, no statistically significant differ-
ence was noted.
Aretrospective study byAmukoa (2007) used 132 patients
with severe head injury admitted to the ICU at KNH between
January and April, 2007. Similar to other studies discussed
Kinyanjui 5
earlier in this review, there was a significant male preponder-
ance (88%) among the participants. Road traffic accidents as
a primary mechanism of injury accounted for 82% of the par-
ticipants. This study reported that "only 25% of the patients
had surgery while the rest had conservative management"
(Amukoa, 2007). According to the study, 91% of the 132
patients died while in the ICU and only 9% were discharged.
Significantly, this study brings to view the picture of an over-
whelmed emergency and intensive care system in Kenya
where mortality is unnecessarily high due to a shortage of
medical personnel and resources.
The last of the unpublished manuscripts reviewed on this
participant was one by Mwang'ombe and Shitsama (2013).
This article, which the authors presented at an international
scientific conference, summarizes several studies conducted
by the lead author between 1979 and 2009, separating the
findings of the studies conducted before CT scan came into
operation at KNH (1979-1985) from those conducted in the
CT scan era (1999-2009). The most significant facts that
came out of this article are that although the male to female
ratio among the participants (7:1 and 8:1) and other demo-
graphics were comparable in the two periods, the mortality
during the pre-CT period was 16%, a sharp contrast with the
overall mortality rate of 57% during the CT period, with 60%
of the patients dying within 48 hours of admission
(Mwang'ombe & Shitsama, 2013). By itself, this article
presents an empirical picture of the tremendous increase in
TBI deaths in Kenya over the past 30 years (W. M. Macharia,
Njeru, Muli-Musiime, & Nantulya, 2009).
Discussion and Recommendations
Overall, this literature review paints a grim picture of TBI in
Kenya, in terms of epidemiology and the quality of services
available for people with TBIs. At the very least, the review
confirms a high and continually increasing prevalence of
TBI in Kenya, based on the numbers mentioned in all the
studies reviewed. More importantly, the literature points to a
significantly high mortality rate among TBI patients who
make it to the hospital; validates the notion that in Kenya,
road traffic accidents are a primary cause for TBIs in particu-
lar, and mortality in general; and raises significant concern
that little is being done to curb this epidemic, or to improve
the treatment of its victims to increase the survival rates.
What is glaringly absent from all the articles written on
TBI in Kenya, with the possible exception of the study by
Gachanja, is what happens to those TBI patients who survive
and are discharged from hospital. In other words, all schol-
arly literature available on TBI in Kenya pertains to the (hos-
pital) treatment of people with brain injuries with no mention
of any post-hospital rehabilitation services for TBI survivors,
most of whom have moderate to severe limitations (Gachanja,
2013; Kiboi etal., 2011; Opondo & Mwangombe, 2007). As
there are no outpatient brain rehabilitation programs affili-
ated with the hospitals such as KNH, and none in the private
sector, TBI survivors in Kenya currently have nowhere to go
for brain injury rehabilitation services such as cognitive
rehabilitation that can enable them to gain an amount of
independence and improve their quality of life, including
obtaining employment when possible. These patients are
typically discharged to their families where they continue to
present as a financial burden directly to those families and
indirectly to society (Saidi etal., 2014). Alternatively, they
are left to fend for themselves, consequently, increasing their
chances of sustaining additional brain injuries. This contrasts
sharply with the attention given to other types of disabling
conditions in Kenya such as visual impairment, deafness,
and developmental disabilities for which there exists reha-
bilitation services including vocational training programs.
TBI is a worldwide problem exerting tremendous eco-
nomic burden on public and private health systems in the
affected countries. Although actual figures are currently
unknown (Humphreys, Wood, Phillips, & Macey, 2013), it is
clearly in the billions of dollars lost each year in terms of
treatment costs and lost productivity. Nowhere is that impact
felt more than in the developing countries such as Kenya
where there is not enough money (Bryan-Hancock &
Harrison, 2010) to cover more critical health care needs. As
studies have shown, the majority of TBI victims are people
between the ages of 20 and 50 (Bruns & Hauser, 2003;
Humphreys etal., 2013; Mwang'ombe & Kiboi, 2001; Saidi
etal., 2014), which represents a period in life when they are
at the peak of their productive potential (W. M. Macharia
etal., 2009). In addition, the majority of TBI victims are
males, who in most cases are the primary or sole breadwin-
ners in their families. Death or disability among this popula-
tion represents an irreparable and permanent loss of income
and livelihood to dependents, resulting in a cycle of poverty
(Eide & Ingstad, 2013) and dependence on society. Moreover,
in countries such as Kenya where there is no social welfare
system, the repercussions are far reaching as dependents of
TBI victims may discontinue their education prematurely
due to lack of financial support, often resorting to underage
employment or engaging in criminal behavior.
It is therefore of crucial importance that steps be taken not
only toward the prevention of TBI related deaths in Kenya
but also in the rehabilitation of those who acquire cognitive
impairments as a result of TBI, to help them return to inde-
pendent and productive lifestyles. To accomplish that, there
is a need for a comprehensive cross-sectional study of
Kenyans with TBI who have been discharged from KNH and
other hospitals in the country to determine their status in
terms of health and functioning, access to resources includ-
ing health services, and their needs and aspirations. Such a
study could be used to help inform policy on addressing the
rehabilitation needs of people with TBI in Kenya.
There is also an urgent need for the establishment of a
clinical screening process to identify specific cognitive limi-
tations as soon as possible following brain for the victims to
receive appropriate rehabilitation services as inpatients and
6 SAGE Open
upon discharge. Most importantly, urgent consideration
needs to be given for the establishment of a rehabilitation
facility for people with TBI in Kenya so that they too can
have the opportunity to return to independent lifestyles and
to participate in life activities like their counterparts.
