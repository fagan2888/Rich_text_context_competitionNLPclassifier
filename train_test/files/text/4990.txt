Abstract
In this article we examine whether the proposal to criminalize illegal stay in the Netherlands was
preceded by increased negative media attention for unauthorized immigrants. Using a corpus
linguistics approach, we carried out a quantitative discourse analysis of all newspaper articles on
unauthorized migrants over a period of 15 years. Our results show that the amount of media
coverage actually strongly decreased in the years before the proposal, and this coverage was
moreover increasingly less negative. This study thus nuances the somewhat popular belief that
unauthorized migrants are increasingly portrayed in negative ways and shows that the framing
of migrants as criminals is a more diffuse process in which the media seem to follow rather than
fuel politics and policy.

Throughout Europe, scholars have found that migration policies are subject to a crimi-
nalization trend. As negative sentiments towards immigrants have come to dominate the
political and public discourses, increasingly stricter and more repressive responses to ­
mostly unauthorized ­ migratory acts have been adopted, including the resort to criminal
law (Berezin, 2009; Bosworth and Guild, 2008; Palidda, 2009; Parkin, 2013). Such
developments fit into the broader trend of crimmigration, a term that was first introduced
by Juliet Stumpf (2006) to refer to the convergence of criminal law and immigration law
and has attracted considerable interest from primarily Anglo-Saxon legal scholars
(Chacon, 2009; Hartry, 2012; Legomsky, 2007; Sklansky, 2012; Welch, 2012). European
scholars have only more recently started to adopt the crimmigration terminology, thereby
identifying the need for a broader definition that encompasses crime control and migra-
tion control, in this way allowing for the inclusion of social practices, discourses, percep-
tions and framing in research (Aas, 2011; Van der Leun and Van der Woude 2012; Van
der Woude, et al., 2014). This would also enable more empirical research and make
comparative studies possible ­ something lacking in the primarily legal-oriented scholar-
ship in this field so far.
Within the European context, the Netherlands has been identified as a particularly
interesting country in which to study the crimmigration process because of its pioneering
role in the adoption of restrictive migrant policies and the strong anti-migration dis-
course surrounding these policies (Aarts and Semetko, 2003; Lesisnka, 2014; Mutsaers,
2014; Vliegenthart and Boomgaarden, 2007). Over the past two decades a large number
of policy measures have been implemented to deter, exclude and remove unauthorized
migrants in particular, policies that increasingly focus on detection, detention and depor-
tation (Van der Leun, 2006, 2010; Van der Leun and Ilies, 2010; Van der Leun and Van
der Woude, 2012; Van Liempt, 2007). Whereas immigration and integration issues did
not receive widespread attention from the Dutch media and public in the 1990s, a stark
increasehasbeennoticedsinceespecially2001(Pakes,2006;SnidermanandHagendoorn,
2007). De jure criminalization has stepped up since 2000, with a strong increase in the
number of undesirable migrant resolutions per year and a lower threshold for being crim-
inally liable with the national implementation of the EU returns directive (Leerkes and
Broeders, 2010; Van der Woude et al., 2014).
These developments recently came to a symbolic conclusion when the government
introduced a bill that would lead to the formal criminalization of illegal stay, the quintes-
sential step in the crimmigration process and `the provisional culmination of twenty
years of stepping up against illegal residence with criminal legislation' (Van der Woude
et al., 2014: 569). Following serious debates, the bill was eventually withdrawn in the
spring of 2014. The Liberal Party, the main sponsor of the bill, agreed to this withdrawal
in return for a set of tax reforms. Although previous governments also discussed formal
criminalization, it was never so seriously considered, thus raising the question of why
this government deemed it necessary and achievable.
Various authors have stated that the media play a central role in the construction of
migrants as deviant and criminal, shaping public views and thereby justifying the appli-
cation of criminal justice responses to unauthorized migration (Gerard and Pickering,
2013; Kim et al., 2011; Mountz, 2010; Spena, 2014). Within the crimmigration literature
it has been argued that discursively constructing certain immigrant groups as criminal in
102 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
the media serves to legitimize the development of crimmigration legislation (Kinney,
2015; Van Berlo, 2015; Van der Woude et al., 2014). Empirical evidence to support this
claim is largely lacking though, making the Dutch bill that criminalized illegal stay a
valuable case study. In this article we therefore examine whether media representations
of unauthorized migrants have been a driving factor behind the proposed criminalization
of illegal stay in the Netherlands. Drawing on theories of agenda-setting, framing and
moral panics, we hypothesize that the increasingly repressive policies towards unauthor-
ized migrants in the Netherlands should be preceded by growing attention for this group
in the Dutch media, including increasingly negative representations. In particular, we
expect newspapers to systematically and increasingly link unauthorized migrants to
issues of crime. Because this hypothesis is hard to test through the often used qualitative
approaches towards discourse analyses, we have carried out an innovative computer-
aided quantitative discourse analysis of all articles on unauthorized migrants that
appeared in Dutch national newspapers between 1999 and 2013, which does allow for an
empirical test of this crucial hypothesis.
Agenda-setting, framing and moral panics: Why media
representations matter
Crimmigration legislation does not arise in a vacuum, but is the result of inter-relational
discursive processes in which migrants are constructed as social threats. The social
construction of the migratory threat essentially rests on reinforcing interactions between
political, public and media discourses, with direct causal relationships within this trian-
gle being generally quite difficult to establish (Duffy and Frere-Smith, 2014). The mass
media are assigned a central position in these processes, through the selection of topics
and issues and through processes of labelling and attributing qualities to groups and
individuals, and inferring causes and meaning (Helbling, 2013; Maneri and ter Wal,
2005). The organization and selection of topics relates to the agenda-setting theory,
which suggests that, by paying considerable attention to certain issues, the media have
the ability to influence what people think about and as such can set the public's agenda
(Dunaway et al., 2010; McCombs and Shaw, 1972). Expanding on this notion, and
related to processes of labelling and attribution, is the concept of framing (Goffman,
1974): it is not only relevant what issues the media write about, it is equally important
how they write about these topics (Boomgaarden and Vliegenthart, 2009). According to
Entman (1993: 52), this means to `select some aspects of a perceived reality and make
them more salient in a communicating context', which can be identified through `the
presence or absence of certain keywords, stock phrases, stereotyped images, sources of
information and sentences that provide thematically reinforcing clusters of facts or
judgments'.
Caviedes (2015: 900) has argued that `the more often the press mentions a particular
issue and links it to a social ill, the more likely that issue is to be considered a "crisis"
meriting political action and resolution'. This resonates closely with Cohen's (1972: 9)
concept of moral panics, which entails that a `condition, episode, person or group of
persons emerges to become defined as a threat to societal values and interests'. A defin-
ing characteristic of moral panics is that the concern itself and the actions taken are
Brouwer et al. 103
highly disproportionate; they exaggerate concerns when the actual threat itself does not
justify criminalization or the curtailing of rights (Goode and Ben-Yehuda, 2009; Hall
et al., 1978). The concept has previously been used to explain the criminalization of
illegal stay in Italy (Maneri, 2011), the criminalization of immigration in post-9/11
United States (Hauptman, 2013), the criminalization of asylum seekers in the United
Kingdom and the United States (Welch and Schuster, 2005; Welch, 2004) and crimmi-
gration processes in Australia (Welch, 2012).
Terminology
Describing unauthorized immigrants as criminals can happen in direct ways, but more
subtle forms are apparent too. In this regard, considerable attention has been drawn to the
use of the term `illegal', which is criticized not only because it `stresses criminality' and
`defines immigrants as criminals' (Lakoff and Ferguson, 2006: 1), but also for being
inaccurate: although a migratory act might be illegal, people themselves cannot be ille-
gal. Moreover, it does not do justice to the complex question of legal and illegal stay,
which includes numerous `in-between' situations described as `semi-compliance'
(Anderson, 2013; Düvell, 2011; Guild, 2004) and the dynamic nature of the phenomenon
(Van Meeteren, 2010). As such, it is what Maneri (2011: 80) defines as `"collective cat-
egories" that lack any descriptive coherence or precision, but are nevertheless replete
with connotations and implicit associations'. Many academics, human rights organiza-
tions and EU institutions, but also various international news associations,1 therefore use
terms that are perceived to be more neutral, most notably `irregular'and `undocumented',
although some academics also explicitly use the term `illegal migrant'in order to empha-
size the role of the state in creating processes that render individuals illegal (Schuster,
2011; Van Eijl, 2008). For the same reason, Bauder (2014) recently argued in favour of
the term `illegalized'. Others also defend use of the term `illegal' for being clear and
accurate, arguing that the alternatives are merely politically correct euphemisms.2 The
debate surrounding terminology has taken on a distinct political character, perhaps most
notably in the United States, where liberal and conservative advocates have both sought
to get their terminological frames to dominate in the media (Merolla et al., 2013). The
preferred word choice then roughly reflects whether someone is in favour of a more
restrictive approach or a more rights-based approach. For example, Anderson and Ruhs
(2010: 175) argue that `"illegality" is also the term that is often used by those elements
of the mass media that promote and reinforce negative public attitudes to immigration,
and illegal immigration in particular'.3
Methodology
In general there is no lack of scholarly attention for the representations of migrants and
other minorities in Western media, although Thorbjornsrud (2015) notes that the num-
ber of studies that focus specifically on unauthorized immigrants is relatively small.
Most of this research has been more or less a critique of the media, focusing on negative
depictions of immigrants and minorities that demonstrate an underlying structural bias
in the media ­ or even society at large (Bleich et al., 2015a). Many of these studies have
104 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
adopted a qualitative approach and often focused on a relatively short time period or a
single event, analysing only a small number of texts (Sciortino and Colombo, 2004).
Because a large number of these researchers also take an explicit stand, such studies
have sometimes been criticized for lacking representativeness and being subject to
`cherry-picking', where researchers select only those articles that confirm their existing
beliefs and initial hypotheses (Hier, 2009; Koller and Mautner, 2004; Orpin, 2005;
Stubbs, 1994). Several more recent studies have therefore employed more systematic
and comparative methods, resulting in various articles demonstrating the complexity of
immigration coverage and challenging the idea that the media are intrinsically biased
and consistently engage in negative framing of immigrants and minorities (Bleich et al.,
2015b; Caviedes, 2015; Hallin, 2015; Lawlor, 2015; Thorbjornsrud, 2015; Tolley,
2015). Yet, despite these important methodological advances, none of these studies
employs what we believe to be one of the most promising approaches towards media
analyses: a corpus linguistics approach.
Corpus linguistics (CL) refers to the study of (often very large bodies of) real-life
textual data (the corpus) with the aid of computer software (Baker, 2006; Mautner, 2009;
McEnery and Wilson, 1996). Corpora are large, representative (or even comprehensive)
bodies of naturally occurring language, and, because they are stored electronically, it
becomes possible to carry out statistical analyses that can reveal ­ possibly counter-
intuitive ­ linguistic patterns and frequency information (Baker, 2006). Until now, cor-
pus techniques have only rarely been used for discourse analyses, although the advantages
of using CL in media studies have repeatedly been demonstrated (Allen and Blinder,
2013; Baker, 2012; Baker et al., 2008; Gabrielatos and Baker, 2008; Koller and Mautner,
2004; Mautner, 2009). One of these advantages is the fact that a researcher can work with
very large amounts of data, which is particularly interesting when studying media con-
tent: as Fairclough (1989: 54) has rightly argued, `a single text on its own is quite insig-
nificant: the effects of media power are cumulative, working through the repetition of
particular ways of handling causality and agency'. Computer-assisted analyses of big
data sets also greatly reduce a researcher's bias and increase the internal validity of a
study, by employing a comprehensive rather than a selective approach (Baker, 2006;
Mautner, 2009). Of course, as Tolley (2015: 968) also acknowledges, the distinction
between manual and automated analyses is far from clear-cut, with computers amplify-
ing rather than replacing human work (see also Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). But,
although much still depends on the individual researcher's choices and his/her interpreta-
tion of the findings, `it becomes less easy to be selective about a single newspaper article
when we are looking at hundreds of articles' (Baker, 2006: 12).
For the current study we used the software program `Wordsmith Tools'to carry out four
types of analysis. First, frequency lists are one of the most basic applications but a good
starting point for the analysis of a corpus (Baker, 2006). They reveal the most frequently
occurring words in a corpus, or show how often specific words appear. Through the analy-
sis of collocates a more discursive analysis of the way immigrants are described becomes
possible on a quantitative level. Collocates are words that appear near another word more
often than could be expected by chance only (Blinder and Allen, 2015), and thus they pro-
vide `a way of understanding meanings and associations between words which are other-
wise difficult to ascertain from a small-scale analysis of a single text' (Baker, 2006: 96).
Brouwer et al. 105
Wordsmith Tools can identify statistically significant collocates, based on their co-occur-
rence, the relative frequency of both words in the corpus and the full size of the corpus.
Following previous studies, we used a window of 10 words for our analysis, 5 to the left
and 5 to the right, using both log likelihood (LL, required minimum score of 6.63) and
mutual information (MI, required minimum score of 5.0) to test for statistical significance
and strength of the relationship between two words (Allen and Blinder, 2013; Baker et al.,
2013; Blinder and Allen, 2015). We focused specifically on the L1 collocate, meaning the
word that appears directly before the keyword, because this will often be an adjective
directly describing the word of interest (Blinder and Allen, 2015). Following Gabrielatos
and Baker (2008), we also use the notion of consistent collocates (c-collocates) for words
that are collocates in at least two-thirds of the annual sub-corpora. The results of a colloca-
tion analysis go further than a mere content analysis, providing `the most salient and obvi-
ous lexical patterns surrounding a subject, from which a number of discourses can be
obtained' (Baker, 2006: 114). Keyness allows the researcher to compare two data sets and
see which words occur significantly more often in one of them, making it a particularly
valuable tool for comparisons. Finally, Concordances combine quantitative and qualitative
methods of content analysis. Baker (2006: 71) describes concordances as `simply a list of
all of the occurrences of a particular search term in a corpus, presented within the context
that they occur in'. This context usually means a number of words, to be decided by the
researcher, to the left and the right of a search term ­ for example, `illegal migrants'.
Concordance analyses thus allow for a closer and more in-depth examination and manual
reading of a selection of relevant articles, and can act as a bridge towards an informed criti-
cal discourse analysis of a smaller number of relevant articles. Here we used it mainly to
provide a `vital validity check' of our quantitative results (Blinder and Allen, 2015: 12).
The corpus
For this study we have created our own specialized corpus, consisting of all newspaper
items on unauthorized migrants that appeared in Dutch national newspapers between 1
January 1999 and 31 December 2013.4 This period was chosen because it also covers a
period from before the watershed events at the beginning of the century that have been
identified as causing a negative change in Dutch public discourse on immigration (Pakes,
2006); the years 1999­2000 can be used as a period where we would expect more `neu-
tral' media content.5 We chose newspapers because their archives are readily available
online and, although numbers have been declining, newspaper readership is still rela-
tively high in the Netherlands, with dailies reaching about 70 percent of the population.
Of the five main newspapers, De Volkskrant, Trouw and NRC Handelsblad are consid-
ered as broadsheets, or `quality newspapers', with the first two being more left-wing and
NRC Handelsblad liberal-conservative. De Telegraaf has the highest circulation in the
Netherlands and, together with Algemeen Dagblad, is considered to be a right-wing,
`popular' newspaper. However, unlike in for example the United Kingdom, the distinc-
tionbetweentabloidandbroadsheetnewspapersholdsminorrelevanceintheNetherlands:
the `popular' newspapers are generally far less populist and sensationalist than, for
example, the Sun or the Daily Express (Bakker and Vasterman, 2007; Broersma and
Graham, 2013). The Dutch media landscape further consists of various free dailies
106 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
mainly distributed on public transport (Metro, Spits, De Pers and Dag, with the latter two
existing only briefly) and two conservative Christian newspapers (Nederlands Dagblad
and Reformatorisch Dagblad). To avoid too much repetition we excluded regional news-
papers, which, following a number of mergers, often have the same sections on national
and foreign news as national newspapers.
Before starting our analyses we manually read a small random sample of newspaper
articles. Besides further familiarizing a researcher with its corpus by already pointing
towards interesting language patterns that require attention further in the analysis, this
procedure can also help either to find specific terms or synonyms that have been missed
in the original search string or to reveal that a high number of irrelevant articles is found
with the search string. The final search string we used was the result of various of these
trial and error steps and, although one can never be entirely sure to have captured all
relevant articles, we believe that in this way we have created a comprehensive `unauthor-
ized migrants' corpus without a high number of irrelevant articles. Our final corpus con-
tains 28,274 articles from 12 national newspapers and consists of just over 10 million
words.6 All these articles were sorted by publication month and newspaper, allowing us
to carry out comparisons between newspapers and over time and identify trends.
Results
Figure 1 shows the number of articles on unauthorized migrants per annum. Because not
all newspapers appeared throughout the complete research period ­ some went out of
business, and others started ­ and results would therefore be skewed towards years with
Figure 1. Number of articles on unauthorized migrants per year, 1999­2013.
Brouwer et al. 107
more newspapers, this figure is based on the five main newspapers only,7 with additional
checks confirming that other newspapers showed similar trend lines. Whereas newspa-
per attention for unauthorized migrants was quite stable until 2006 ­ fluctuating only
slightly each year ­ there was a sharp decrease in the number of articles per year during
the period 2006­9, after which attention steadily increased again. However, the annual
number of newspaper articles did not ever reach the same numbers as in the 1999­2006
period. If we look at the distribution of newspaper articles per month in 2010, November
and December have by far the most articles. The proposal to criminalize unauthorized
stay was introduced in October 2010, practically the lowest point of media attention.
Frequency lists and concordance analyses confirmed that the rise in attention for unau-
thorized migrants during the last three years of our study is primarily due to the political
and public controversy over the proposal.
One possible reason for the decline in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants is
the enlargement of the European Union with 10 (mainly East European) countries in
2004, and Bulgaria and Romania in 2007. Overnight this legalized unauthorized immi-
grants from those countries and it is one of the most important explanations for the
decreasing number of estimated unauthorized migrants in the Netherlands (Van der
Heijden et al., 2011). At the same time there appears to have been a shift in the public
debate, where populist resistance against Islam and immigration has been replaced, or at
least supplemented, by a fierce resistance against European integration (Wansink, 2007).
It therefore seemed plausible that part of the media attention for unauthorized migrants
has shifted to migrants from East European countries ­ and that they are no longer referred
to as unauthorized migrants. But, whereas a LexisNexis analysis indeed showed a much
higher number of annual articles about East European migrants since 2004, a content

108 European Journal of Criminology 14(1)
analysis of various nationalities and terms such as `East European' did not show a declin-
ing trend in our corpus ­ either absolute or relative. This means that, although there has
been a general increase in newspaper attention on East European migrants, this cannot
explain the decrease in articles on unauthorized migrants. Instead, there does not seem to
be one, clear explanation for the decline in newspaper attention for unauthorized migrants.
Looking at the distribution of newspaper articles per month, it becomes immediately
clear that there are a few spikes in newspaper attention for unauthorized migrants. Closer
examination of these months reveals that these can be explained by specific events that
attracted strong media attention for a brief period of time. In June 2000, most articles are
about 58 Chinese migrants who died of suffocation in the back of a truck while on their
way to the United Kingdom. The high points in February 2004 and September and
December 2006 are primarily due to political controversies surrounding the former
Dutch Minister for Aliens Affairs and Integration Rita Verdonk, who was known for her
tough stance towards unauthorized migrants. The most recent peak in May 2013 is due
to serious debates within the governing Labour Party about the proposed criminalization
of illegal stay. It therefore seems that political debates and developments are the main
cause of intense media attention on unauthorized migrants. Gabrielatos and Baker (2008:
18) noted a similar effect in the United Kingdom, where immigrants `were thus function-
alised as part of a struggle for political hegemony, being discursively constructed as a
people who merely constitute the topic of political debate, somewhat dehumanised as an
"issue"'. It is also noteworthy that other high-profile events that involve or could poten-
tially be linked to unauthorized migrants ­ a fire at the airport immigrant detention centre
that killed 11 unauthorized migrants, various (international) terrorist attacks ­ have not
caused the same increase in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants.
Discourse: Terminology
In Dutch newspapers, `illegal' is by far the most often used term to refer to unauthorized
migrants ­ over 95 percent of instances. `Irregular' and `undocumented' are very rarely
used, and sometimes even in different contexts, such as `irregular rebel groups'.
Moreover, this finding applies, without exception, to newspapers across the political
spectrum. Similar figures were recently found in the United States, where. in over 95
percent of cases newspapers used the term `illegal' (Merolla et al., 2013). If we look at
the distribution of cases where the term `illegal' is used, it becomes evident that it is
much more often used as a noun (`illegals') than as an adjective (`illegal migrant' or
`illegal immigrant'). When `illegal' is used as an adjective, the most common noun is
`immigrant', followed by `migrant' and `alien'. Instances of `illegal asylum seeker' and
`illegal refugee' ­ legally speaking impossible constructions ­ also appear several dozen
times per year. The term `rejected asylum seekers' (`uitgeprocedeerde asielzoekers'),
which does not convey the exact same meaning, is the second most often used term, but
the saliency of this term varies widely between years. Use of `illegal' as a noun does
show a steady decline throughout the period, both absolutely and relatively, but this can-
not be explained by a replacing term. Rather, it seems to be the result of an increasing
focus on the condition of `illegality' in later years, as a place in which people can `disap-
pear' or `end up in'.
Brouwer et al. 109
A criminal discourse?
Considering the fact that `illegals' was the most common way to describe unauthorized
migrants, and we were interested in how unauthorized migrants as a group were
described, we carried out a collocation analysis for this term. Table 1 shows an overview
of the statistically significant collocates of `illegals', sorted on the L1 position (the posi-
tion immediately before `illegals') for the period 1999­2013, without words such as
`the', `or', `and'.
The most important L1 collocate for `illegals' is `white', referring to a group of unau-
thorized migrants who had long resided in the Netherlands but, owing to the enactment of
the 1998 LinkingAct, suddenly lost most of their rights. The word `white'is used here with
the connotation of a semi-documented position in society and does not refer to physical
appearance. The focus on this group is entirely clustered in the initial years, particularly in
Table 1. Collocates of `illegals', 1999­2013.

1999. Our results also show that numerical terms are often used to describe `illegals', indi-
cating that an important characteristic is how many there are. Except for absolute numbers
(`000', `million', etc.), these include more vague numerical descriptions (`thousands', `tens
of thousands', even `millions') and group descriptors (`a lot', `groups of'). Vollmer (2011:
330) noted that `number games' play a crucial role in policy discourses on unauthorized
migration throughout the EU, where `higher numbers justify control and enforcement poli-
cies, whereas lower numbers ease the political landscape'. `Stream' is also a strong L1
collocate, which confirms earlier findings that aquatic terms are frequently used in con-
junction with migratory movements. Tsoukala (2005) argues that these terms have quickly
become standardized in discourses on immigration and create a notion of uncontrollability
and threat. What is, however, particularly notable for our main hypothesis is that `criminal'
is one of the most important adjectives used with the term `illegals', showing that one of
the most common ways to describe `illegals' is as criminals.
Trends and developments
Although `criminal' was one of the most important L1 collocates for `illegals', we were
also interested in identifying patterns over time. Therefore we tested whether it was a c-col-
locate by carrying out collocation analyses for the word `illegals' in each separate year.
This showed that `criminal' as an adjective8 scored significant LL scores in all 15 years of
our corpus and significant MI scores in 13 years (in 2000 and 2012 the scores fell just short
of the 5.0 requirement). Turning it around, the term `criminals' is a significant c-collocate
of the adjective `illegal', falling short of the required statistical scores only in 2006 and
2011. The term `criminals' was also a significant collocate of `illegals' in all years after
2002, except for 2004 and 2009, thus being a c-collocate for the period 2002­13. This
shows that `illegals' often appear in the same sentence as `criminal' and `criminals'.
Both `criminal illegals' and `illegal criminals' are thus constructions that can be regu-
larly found, demonstrating that in newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants crime is
one of the main topics discussed, and this has been the case throughout the 15 years of
our corpus. Similar analyses with the terms `asylum seekers', `refugees', `migrants' and
`immigrants' showed fewer or no references to crime. Although our corpus is not a rep-
resentative reflection of all newspaper content on these groups ­ it contains only news-
paper articles that also mention unauthorized migrants ­ this suggests that, in Dutch
newspapers, unauthorized migrants in particular are strongly associated with crime.
Yet, although the adjective `criminal' is a c-collocate of `illegals', a content analysis
of the phrase `criminal illegals' showed a steady decrease in use of the term between
1999 and 2013.
Figure 3 shows that, over time, not only did usage of the word `illegal' show a steady
decrease, but Dutch newspapers also described unauthorized migrants less often as crim-
inals. In the last two years of the period studied, only four instances of `criminal illegals'
per year occurred, of which two did not even refer to the Netherlands. Although some
other variations appear in the corpus ­ especially `criminal aliens', albeit still only one-
third of the times `criminal illegals'­ there is no contrary trend visible in the use of these
terms. Although crime remains an important topic in newspaper articles throughout our
corpus, it is far less of an issue in the period around the proposed criminalization of
Brouwer et al. 111
illegal stay than it was around 2000, and unauthorized migrants are gradually less often
directly described as criminal.
Differences between newspapers
Whereas there are thus indications of a criminalizing discourse in Dutch newspapers
regarding unauthorized migrants, we found considerable differences between newspa-
pers, as illustrated by a keyness comparison between the left-wing `quality' newspaper
De Volkskrant and the right-wing `popular' De Telegraaf.
Figure 4 shows how often various crime-related terms appeared per 10,000 words in both
newspapers. The words `criminal'and `criminals'appeared three to four times more often in
De Telegraaf than in De Volkskrant. Related terms ­ `police' and `arrested' ­ were also

found significantly more often in De Telegraaf, thus lending empirical support to the asser-
tion that right-wing newspapers more often link unauthorized migrants to issues of crime.
Conclusion and discussion
In this study we have analysed 15 years of Dutch newspaper content on unauthorized
migrants. Employing a corpus linguistics methodology, we have been able to identify
various patterns in both the frequency of newspaper articles and the discursive ele-
ments of how unauthorized migrants are described, thus testing the hypothesis that
media content fuels the crimmigration process. Our analysis revealed some familiar
ways in which unauthorized migrants are consistently depicted by all Dutch newspa-
pers. The first and foremost is the constant way in which these newspapers refer to
unauthorized migrants: `illegals', or at best `illegal (im)migrants'. The term `illegal'
is also consistently used in the Dutch political discourse, and it seems to have rele-
vance for arguments regarding actual legislation: in the debate about the formal crimi-
nalization of unauthorized stay at least one politician publicly argued that `it is of
course very strange that something is illegal, but has no punishment to it'.9 At the EU
level there have been attempts to stop use of the term `illegal' and instead employ the
words `irregular' and `undocumented'.10 The Platform for International Cooperation
on Undocumented Migrants (PICUM) recently launched a campaign to ban use of the
term `illegal migrant', including a leaflet with preferable equivalents in all major
European languages. For the Dutch language the NGO suggests the terms `mensen
zonder papieren' and `mensen zonder wettig verblijf' (literally: `people without
papers' and `people without lawful stay'). These descriptions seem rather long for
everyday usage and therefore unlikely to become part of popular discourse; although
the second option is to some extent an accepted term in Flanders,11 it does not appear
a single time in 15 years of Dutch newspaper articles. Whereas in the United States
recent changes in the stylebooks of major media outlets suggest a greater prevalence
of alternative terms in the near future (Merolla et al., 2013), in the Netherlands there
does not appear to be any meaningful discussion going on about terminology. At the
same time, one can wonder if a terminology replacement might not merely lead to
what has been dubbed `the euphemism treadmill' (Pinker, 2007), whereby the replace-
ment terms themselves become offensive over time. Moreover, two recent studies in
the United States showed that terminology frames ­ `illegal' versus `unauthorized'/
`irregular'/`undocumented' ­ did not influence public opinion regarding the provision
of certain rights for unauthorized migrants, leading the authors to suggest that it might
be more useful for migrant rights activists to focus on actual policies and how they are
framed, rather than on terminology frames (Knoll et al., 2012; Merolla et al., 2013).
In this regard it is interesting to note that the rise in newspaper articles about unau-
thorized migrants in the last years of our corpus can be solely attributed to the politi-
cal and public discussion this bill triggered, but newspaper content during this time
was not necessarily characterized by the framing of unauthorized migrants as crimi-
nal. Some concordance analyses even indicate that various newspapers offered a plat-
form for substantial critique of the proposal, in this way possibly even playing a role
in its eventual withdrawal in 2014.
Brouwer et al. 113
One of the findings that stood out in our analysis was that `criminal' was one of the
most important collocates of `illegals', providing evidence for a criminal discourse and
a merger of references to migration and crime. Dutch newspaper articles about unauthor-
ized migrants deal significantly often with issues of crime; indeed, it is one of the most
salient themes. Needless to say, this is the quintessential discourse on which the crimi-
nalization of unauthorized migrants rests. Framing unauthorized migrants as criminals,
in combination with a strong focus on numbers, serves as a powerful catalyst for what
Vollmer (2011: 331) calls `the demonstration of efficient governance', resulting in
repressive and punitive policies with an intense focus on control.
Although these findings are a reason for concern, our main hypothesis proved incor-
rect: media attention for unauthorized migrants strongly decreased after 2006 and news-
paper articles about crime among unauthorized migrants featured mainly in the first
years of our corpus. The proposal to criminalize illegal stay came at practically the low-
est point of media attention for unauthorized migrants, and seems to have been the result
of a change in government rather than of active agenda-setting by the media or another
actor. This provides some modest support for Threadgold's (2009: 1) statement that there
is `a small but growing body of evidence that political and policy discourse concerning
immigration actually fuel the media discourse, which in turn drives policy'. The present
study has clearly demonstrated that the bill to criminalize illegal stay in the Netherlands
was not preceded by strong and increasing media attention for criminal illegal migrants.
Rather, the framing of migrants as criminals is a more diffuse process in which the media
seem to follow rather than fuel politics and policy.
Whereas the initial years of our corpus support the idea of a moral panic episode
about `criminal illegals', this is not something we see in later years. However, we also
see that the problem of the `criminal illegal'keeps lingering on and surfacing every now
and then. In this regard it is interesting to see that Cohen (2002) more recently noted
that reactions to asylum seekers do not follow the ordinary temporary moral panic
model, but are subject to continuous negative, excluding and hostile messages. In their
study on UK media reporting around Bulgarian and Romanian EU accession, Mawby
and Gisby (2009: 48) argue that this model is `now a more accurate way to model a
cluster of issues, such as immigration in general' and they note that `this open-ended
form of moral panic has seemingly "stepping stoned" its way from asylum seekers to
immigrants, to EU enlargement, to general anxieties about crime'. This is relevant,
because although our corpus showed that newspaper articles about unauthorized
migrants decreased, articles about migrants from new EU countries actually increased,
and it is questionable whether the general public is always aware of such distinctions
within the broad category of `foreigners'. If negative attention for unauthorized migrants
has merely been replaced by negative attention for foreign EU citizens and other ethnic
and racial minority groups, and in the public perception these various categories are
assembled into one homogeneous problematic group of outsiders, the decrease in news-
paper articles on (criminal) unauthorized migrants will have had hardly any effect on
public opinion about this specific group. In light of increasing European integration and
the negative backlash this seems to cause in primarily West European countries, it
would be worthwhile to examine media content on new European citizens and what this
means for the future of the European project.

While this study provided valuable insights into newspaper reporting on unauthorized
migrants in the Netherlands, it simultaneously raised various questions that point to
interesting areas for future research. Here we have focused only on print media, but
analyses of web-based content could be equally interesting. Furthermore, linking the
analysis of media content to a more systematic analysis of the political discourse could
increase our understanding of who influences whom. Finally, and most importantly,
although here we have focused on the Netherlands only, we believe the approach we
have introduced is particularly suitable for large-scale comparisons and hope to have laid
the foundation for future comparative work between various European countries. This
could focus on unauthorized migrants, but it would also be particularly worthwhile to
examine how newspapers in different European countries have reported on the recent
refugee crisis. The corpus linguistics approach allows for quick replications of analyses
with large sets of longitudinal data. Because the statistical tests offer easy to compare
outcomes, it is eminently appropriate for a systematic comparison of discourses in vari-
ous countries.

3. We use the term `unauthorized migrant' because it is most inclusive of the population we
refer to here, and other terms either are too limited in scope (for example, not all unauthorized
migrants are undocumented) or seem to reflect a particular political stand or viewpoint. See
Passel et al. (2004) for some additional discussion.

the selection of the right query terms, see Gabrielatos (2007). We included the term `rejected asy-
lum seeker'because it is often used interchangeably with unauthorized migrant, at times it simply
overlaps and in order to see if there were different discourses around different terms.

politician Pim Fortuyn in 2002 by a political environmental activist in 2002, and the murder
of film maker and outspoken Islam-critic Theo van Gogh by a radicalized Dutch-Moroccan
