Introduction
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional
bowel disorder characterized by recurrent symp-
toms of abdominal pain related to defecation
along with altered bowel function (i.e. changes in
the form or frequency of stool1) and effects on
health-related quality of life (QOL).2,3 IBS can
further be subdivided by stool consistency,
namely, constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C),
diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), or a

Abstract
Background: Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) impairs patient quality
of life (QOL). Rifaximin is an oral, nonsystemic antibiotic indicated for IBS-D. The objective of
this secondary analysis was to evaluate rifaximin retreatment on IBS-related QOL in patients
with IBS-D.
Methods: Patients received open-label rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks. Clinical
responders [simultaneously meeting weekly response criteria for abdominal pain (30%
improvement from baseline in mean weekly pain score) and stool consistency (50% decrease
from baseline in number of days/week with Bristol Stool Scale (BSS) type 6 or 7 stools) during
2 of first 4 weeks posttreatment] who relapsed during an up to 18-week treatment-free
observation phase were randomly assigned to receive two 2-week courses of double-blind
rifaximin or placebo, separated by 10 weeks. A validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire
examined patient responses in 8 domains.
Results: The 2579 patients receiving open-label rifaximin experienced a mean improvement
from baseline in IBS-QOL overall score of 54.9%. Responders to open-label rifaximin (n =
1074 of 2438 evaluable; 44.1%) had significantly greater improvement from baseline in IBS-
QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores, including dysphoria, food avoidance, interference
with activity, body image, and sexual function versus nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment
(n = 1364; p < 0.001 for all comparisons). A significantly greater percentage of responders to
open-label rifaximin achieved the minimally clinically important difference (MCID; 14-point
improvement from baseline) in the overall IBS-QOL score versus nonresponders [n = 561
(52.2%) versus n = 287 (21.0%); p < 0.0001]. Among 636 patients with IBS-D relapse, the MCID
in the overall IBS-QOL score was achieved by a significantly greater percentage of patients
receiving double-blind rifaximin versus placebo (38.6% versus 29.6%, respectively; p = 0.009).
Conclusions: Open-label and blinded retreatment with a short course (2 weeks) of rifaximin
improved IBS-QOL in patients with IBS-D [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01543178].

combination of both (IBS-M).4 Patients with IBS
with moderate-to-severe symptoms often require
more intensive management with prescription
therapies.5 IBS negatively impacts aspects of
patients' daily activity and social wellbeing, includ-
ing work productivity, social activities, and travel.6
Patients with IBS participating in a web-based
survey indicated a restriction of daily activities on
approximately 73 days/year (20% annually); 13%
of respondents reported not working because of
health-related reasons.7 Patients with IBS cited a
number of factors they believed to be associated
with severity of IBS symptoms [e.g. pain (80%),
bowel difficulties (74%), bloating (69%), dietary
limitations (69%)], with the number of factors
cited directly correlating with an increase in IBS
symptom severity.
Health-related QOL was shown to be impaired in
patients with IBS, as demonstrated by a pooled
analysis of 14 studies in which scores for all
domains of the health-related QOL instrument
(i.e. social function, physical role, emotional role,
bodily pain, mental health, vitality, general health,
and physical function) were decreased (i.e. indi-
cating poorer QOL) in patients with IBS com-
pared with individuals without IBS.2 Thus, it is
apparent that QOL is substantially impacted in
patients with IBS, but whether treatment of IBS
improves QOL is not fully understood.
The gut microbiota may be altered in IBS,
although variations are possibly species- and
patient-specific, and additional research is needed
to firmly establish a causative effect.8­12
Nonetheless, treatments aimed at modulating the
gut microbiota have been shown to improve symp-
toms in patients with IBS.13,14 Rifaximin, an oral,
nonsystemic, minimally absorbed antibiotic, sig-
nificantly improved global and individual IBS-D
symptoms in two randomized, placebo-controlled,
phase III studies of single, short-course (2-week)
therapy.15 A third phase III study [Trial 3
(TARGET 3)] examined the efficacy of rifaximin
repeat treatment in patients with IBS-D.16 A sig-
nificantly greater percentage of patients receiving
rifaximin compared with placebo achieved the pri-
mary efficacy endpoint of response to repeat treat-
ment with rifaximin compared with placebo
(38.1% versus 31.5%, respectively; p = 0.03).
Based on these data, rifaximin is an effective
option for the treatment of IBS-D,15,16 with a
number needed to treat of 10.6,17 a number
needed to harm of 846,17 and a low risk of bacte-
rial antibiotic resistance.18,19 However, the impact
of repeat treatment with rifaximin on patient
QOL has not been previously reported. Many
believe that QOL should be a major component
of clinical studies and treatment trials in func-
tional gastrointestinal disorders.3,20,21 The aim of
this study was to evaluate the effect of repeat
treatment with rifaximin on IBS-related QOL in
patients with IBS-D.
Methods
Study design and patient population
This was a secondary analysis of a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter,
phase III trial [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:
NCT01543178] and the patient population and
study design have been previously described.16
Briefly, individuals 18 years of age with a
diagnosis of IBS (based on Rome III criteria)
with average symptom severity scores of 3 for
IBS-related abdominal pain (range, 0 = no pain
to 10 = worst possible pain you can imagine)
and bloating (range, 0 = not at all to 6 = a very
great deal) during the screening phase, and with
stools for 2 days per week meeting Bristol
Stool Scale (BSS) criteria for type 6 or type 7
consistency, were eligible for inclusion in the
study.
During the screening phase (10 ± 3 days), all
patients received single-blind placebo three
times a day and reported daily IBS-related
symptoms (Figure 1). In the open-label treat-
ment phase, patients received rifaximin 550 mg
three times a day for 2 weeks, followed by a
4-week treatment-free follow-up period during
which response [defined as meeting weekly
response criteria for both abdominal pain
(30% improvement from baseline in mean
weekly pain score) and stool consistency (50%
decrease from baseline in number of days/week
with BSS type 6 or 7 stools) during 2 of the 4
weeks] was evaluated. Nonresponders to open-
label rifaximin were withdrawn from the study.
Responders were subsequently followed, treat-
ment-free, for up to 18 additional weeks (obser-
vation phase), or until relapse. Relapse after
response to open-label rifaximin was defined as
<30% improvement from baseline in mean
weekly abdominal pain score or <50% reduc-
tion from baseline in number of days/week with
BD Cash, M Pimentel et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 691
BSS type 6 or 7 stools for 3 weeks of a con-
secutive, rolling 4-week period during the treat-
ment-free observation phase. Patients who
relapsed were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive
two 2-week repeat courses of rifaximin 550 mg
three times a day or placebo, with repeat courses
separated by 10 weeks (double-blind treatment
phases). All patients provided written informed
consent and the protocol was approved by all
institutional review boards and ethics commit-
tees at all centers. All authors had full access to
study data and reviewed and approved the final
manuscript.
Quality-of-life assessments
Baseline data for the open-label and double-
blind phases of the study were based on 7 days of
patient diary data collected immediately preced-
ing open-label and double-blind rifaximin repeat
treatment, respectively. QOL was assessed using
a validated 34-item IBS-QOL questionnaire,22
with each item scored on a 5-point Likert
response scale (1 = `not at all,' 2 = `slightly,' 3 =
`moderately,' 4 = `quite a bit,' or 5 = `extremely'
or `a great deal'). Data were converted to a
summed score (range, 0­100) using the follow-
ing formula: score = 100 × [(number of items ×
5 - sum of all the items) / (5 × number of items
- number of items)]. A higher score on the 0­100
scale indicated better QOL. IBS-QOL overall
and eight subdomain scores (i.e. dysphoria,
interference with activity, body image, health
worry, food avoidance, social reaction, sexual
function, and social relationships) were calcu-
lated. During the open-label treatment phase,
the IBS-QOL questionnaire was administered in
the clinic at open-label rifaximin baseline, by
phone at end of the 4-week follow-up, and then
by phone every 4 weeks for patients who contin-
ued to respond during the 18-week observation
phase. During the double-blind treatment
phases, the IBS-QOL questionnaire was admin-
istered in the clinic at double-blind baseline (ran-
domization), by phone at the end of the 4-week
follow-up (primary evaluation period), by phone
at 4-week intervals of the repeat treatment obser-
vation phase, and in the clinic at the start of sec-
ond repeat treatment and the end of the study.
Scores were not calculated for patients with miss-
ing data for any item at a given assessment. An
improvement in IBS-QOL overall score of 14
points from baseline to a time point of interest
was considered the minimally clinically impor-
tant difference (MCID; i.e. the smallest differ-
ence perceived by patients to be beneficial).21

Statistical analyses
The change from open-label baseline in the IBS-
QOL overall and subdomain scores to 4 weeks
posttreatment was analyzed using descriptive
statistics. Comparisons of IBS-QOL scores
between groups (i.e. open-label responders ver-
sus nonresponders, open-label responders with
and without relapse, rifaximin versus placebo)
were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). A two-way ANOVA was used to
compare IBS-QOL scores in patients receiving
one or two repeat treatments in the double-blind
phase. An unstratified Cochran­Mantel­
Haenszel general association test for categorical
data was used to compare IBS-QOL scores in
patients receiving open-label treatment who
achieved improvement from baseline 14
points. A Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel test strati-
fied by analysis center, time to recurrence, and
recurrence type was used to compare IBS-QOL
scores in patients receiving double-blind treat-
ment who achieved improvement from baseline
14 points.
Results
Demographic and baseline disease
characteristics
The mean baseline IBS-QOL overall score in
the 2579 patients who were treated with open-
label rifaximin was 48.3. A total of 1074 (44.1%)
of the 2438 patients who received open-label
rifaximin and completed the 4-week follow-up
phase were responders (i.e. improvement in
both abdominal pain and stool consistency for
2 of 4 weeks following rifaximin treatment).16
A total of 1257 patients were nonresponders
and were withdrawn from the study as prespeci-
fied in the protocol. During the observation
phase, 692 patients experienced symptom
relapse, and 636 of these patients were ran-
domly assigned to receive repeat treatment with
either rifaximin (n = 328) or placebo (n = 308).
Demographic and baseline disease characteris-
tics were generally comparable between both
the open-label and double-blind populations
and within the double-blind population (Table
1),16 with the exception that patients entering
the double-blind phase had higher (i.e.
improved) overall baseline IBS-QOL and sub-
domain scores compared with baseline scores of
patients entering the open-label phase (i.e. prior
to open-label rifaximin; Table 1).
Open-label phase
Patients receiving open-label rifaximin treat-
ment reported improvements from baseline in
IBS-QOL overall and eight subdomain scores
(see Figure S1, published online) at 4 weeks
posttreatment, with a mean improvement from
baseline of 54.9% in the IBS-QOL overall
score [95% confidence interval, 48.4­61.4%].
Responders to open-label treatment with rifaxi-
min (n = 1074) had statistically significantly
greater improvement from baseline in IBS-QOL
overall and subdomain scores compared with
nonresponders at 4 weeks posttreatment (n =
1364; Figure 2). The MCID in the IBS-QOL
overall score from open-label baseline to 4 weeks
posttreatment was achieved by 52.2% (n = 561)
and 21.0% (n = 287) of responders and nonre-
sponders, respectively (p < 0.0001). The mean
change from baseline in overall IBS-QOL score
and IBS-QOL subdomain scores for interference
with activity, body image, and food avoidance at
the 4-week posttreatment follow-up was statisti-
cally significantly greater in open-label respond-
ers to rifaximin remaining relapse-free during
the open-label observation phase (n = 370),
compared with responders who relapsed during
the maintenance phase (n = 636; Figure 3).
Open-label responders to rifaximin remaining
relapse-free had numerically greater mean
changes from baseline in IBS-QOL subdomain
scores for dysphoria, health worry, social reac-
tion, sexual function, and social relationships
domain scores at the 4-week posttreatment

follow-up compared with responders who
relapsed during the maintenance phase, although
between-group differences did not achieve sta-
tistical significance.
Double-blind phase
The mean change from open-label baseline to
end of study (i.e. after double-blind rifaximin
retreatment) in IBS-QOL overall and subdomain
scores for dysphoria, interference with activity,
health worry, and sexual function domains were
significantly greater for patients receiving repeat
treatment with rifaximin versus placebo in the
double-blind phase (p  0.05; Figure 4). Patients
receiving double-blind rifaximin had greater
mean improvement from open-label baseline to
end of study (i.e. after double-blind rifaximin
retreatment) in IBS-QOL subdomain scores for
body image, food avoidance, social reaction, and
social relationships domains compared with

(rifaximin, 89.9%; placebo, 91.9%). The MCID
in the IBS-QOL overall score from double-blind
baseline to the end of first retreatment 4-week
follow-up was achieved by a significantly greater
percentage of patients receiving rifaximin com-
pared with placebo (38.6% versus 29.6%, respec-
tively; p = 0.009). For patients who received
open-label rifaximin and both double-blind treat-
ment courses, the improvement from double-
blind baseline to the end of first double-blind
treatment follow-up in IBS-QOL overall and
most subdomain scores (excepting IBS-QOL
health worry and sexual function subdomain
scores) was greater compared with patients who
received open-label rifaximin and two courses of
placebo treatment (Figure 5). However, in
patients who received two repeat treatments, dif-
ferences between treatment groups (i.e. rifaximin
versus placebo) were not statistically significant
when comparing mean improvement in IBS-
QOL overall score from open-label baseline with
the 4-week follow-up after open-label rifaximin
(i.e. treatment #1) or the first double-blind treat-
ment (i.e. treatment #2) (see Figure S2, pub-
lished online). A statistical analysis could not be
conducted because there was an insufficient
number of patients receiving both double-blind
treatments who had IBS-QOL data at the end of
study; consequently, no comparison of change in
overall score from open-label baseline to end of
study was conducted. Mean improvement values
for IBS-QOL overall score from open-label base-
line to 4 weeks after the first double-blind retreat-
ment with rifaximin or placebo were comparable
with those of the improvement from open-label
baseline to the second double-blind retreatment
baseline (see Figure S2, published online).
Patients who completed the study had improve-
ment from open-label baseline in IBS-QOL over-
all scores for the duration of the study (i.e. all
assessments) with both rifaximin and placebo
(see Figure S3, published online).
Discussion
The findings of this study indicate that repeat
treatment with rifaximin favorably impacts IBS-
QOL overall and all eight subdomain scores in
patients with IBS-D. Moreover, IBS-QOL overall
and all subdomain scores were improved from
baseline for up to 4 weeks posttreatment in
patients receiving 2-week open-label rifaximin

treatment, with the greatest improvements from
baseline observed for the IBS-QOL subdomains
of dysphoria and interference with activity.
Interestingly, IBS-QOL subdomain scores for
food avoidance, interference with activity, and
dysphoria have been shown to be low (i.e. poorer
QOL) in patients with IBS-D,23,24 and the major-
ity of patients with IBS have self-reported intoler-
ances to a number of foods, which aberrantly
affects QOL.25 Indeed, in the open-label popula-
tion, baseline IBS-QOL subdomain scores for
food avoidance, interference with activity, and
dysphoria were among the lowest, compared with
other IBS-QOL subdomain scores. All of these
subdomain scores significantly improved in
responders treated with rifaximin compared with
nonresponders. It is valuable to note that the IBS-
QOL is a derivative measure that reflects the per-
ceptions of patients with IBS, including the
amount of control they have over their symptoms,
if they can socialize, and their sexual relation-
ships, which can have lasting effects even if there
is some degree of symptom change. It was not
designed as a surrogate measure of symptoms or
function.
Improvements from open-label baseline in IBS-
QOL overall and subdomain scores for food
avoidance, interference with activity, and body
image were significantly greater in patients who
responded to open-label rifaximin who did not
relapse during the treatment-free observation
phase, as compared with those who responded
and subsequently relapsed during the observation
phase. This finding suggests that greater improve-
ment in QOL following treatment with rifaximin
is associated with a lower chance of subsequent
symptom relapse. Indeed, responders to open-
label treatment with rifaximin had significantly
greater improvement from baseline in the IBS-
QOL overall score based on an MCID 14 points
compared with nonresponders at 4 weeks post-
treatment. The subgroup of nonresponders who
achieved the MCID in IBS-QOL may not have
met the formal prespecified criteria for response,
but it is possible that they may have experienced
enough improvement in their clinical symptoms
with rifaximin treatment that they deemed their
QOL improved. While a direct association
between MCID and the symptomatic response to
rifaximin is not entirely expected, clinically mean-
ingful improvement in IBS-QOL appears to be
consistent with improvements in abdominal pain
and stool consistency previously reported for
these patients.16 These data demonstrate that a

rifaximin is associated with clinically meaningful
improvement in QOL in patients with IBS-D.
For patients with open-label response to rifaximin
who relapsed during the observation phase and
were randomly assigned to double-blind rifaximin
or placebo, a statistically significantly greater per-
centage of patients receiving rifaximin achieved an
MCID in IBS-QOL overall score from double-
blind baseline to end of first retreatment 4-week
follow-up compared with placebo, providing fur-
ther evidence of the sustained beneficial and clini-
cally meaningful impact of rifaximin on QOL in
patients with IBS-D. These favorable findings
regarding QOL appear to align with the significant
improvement in efficacy outcomes observed with
rifaximin compared with placebo during the first
double-blind retreatment phase of the study, sug-
gesting that improvement in IBS-QOL may, in
part, be driven by relief of IBS symptoms follow-
ing repeat treatment with rifaximin versus pla-
cebo.16 Interestingly, when patients had recurrent
IBS symptoms after responding to open-label
rifaximin, the baseline QOL immediately preced-
ing double-blind, repeat treatment was improved
compared with that reported at open-label base-
line. This is consistent with data previously
reported for this trial for IBS symptom scores (e.g.
20% improvement in abdominal pain at double-
blind baseline relative to symptom severity prior
to open-label rifaximin), which were also lower
(improved) compared with open-label baseline
data.16 The improvement in QOL at baseline of
the double-blind, repeat treatment phase reduces
the statistical power to detect measurable improve-
ment related to a potential carryover effect.26
The improvement from both open-label and dou-
ble-blind baseline to the end of study observed in
IBS-QOL overall scores between rifaximin and
placebo with short-term exposure (i.e. 2 weeks)
was comparable with data reported for patients
with IBS-D receiving the mixed µ-opioid receptor
agonist/-opioid receptor antagonist eluxadoline
100 mg and 75 mg after 12 weeks of twice-daily
therapy.27 However, it is unclear whether
improvements in IBS-QOL overall scores are
durable for eluxadoline following treatment dis-
continuation. The selective type 3 serotonin
receptor antagonist alosetron 1 mg administered
twice daily improved IBS-specific QOL subdo-
main scores for emotional, mental health, sleep,
energy, food/diet, social function, and physical
role from baseline after 12 weeks in women with
severe IBS-D.28 Alosetron 1 mg twice daily also
improved IBS-specific QOL subscale scores for
physical role, food/diet, and social function and
met or exceeded the MCID in two randomized,
placebo-controlled studies of women with IBS-D
or IBS-M after 12 weeks of therapy.29 Similar to
eluxadoline, alosetron must be administered
daily, long-term, so durability of QOL improve-
ment following treatment discontinuation is
unclear. In addition, direct comparisons of alose-
tron with rifaximin are limited because of a differ-
ent disease-specific QOL instrument used in
alosetron trials.28,29
A limitation of the current study is that patients
who responded to open-label rifaximin, but who
did not relapse during the 18-week, treatment-
free observation phase, discontinued from the
study per protocol. Therefore, further assessment
of this nonrelapsing patient population was not
conducted to evaluate the duration of improve-
ment in IBS-QOL scores beyond a total of 18
weeks after response was assessed. Another limi-
tation of the current study is that when data were
missing for an item within the subdomains of the
IBS-QOL instrument, scores were not calculated
at a given time point, limiting the data available
for some assessments during the study. Data from
some assessments included a small number of
patients (e.g. patients who only received one
repeat treatment course). In addition, some com-
ponents of the IBS-QOL instrument, although a
valid instrument for IBS-D, have been reported
not to be optimal for patients with IBS-D,30 and
thus using this instrument may not have fully
assessed the condition of IBS-D and potential
impact of treatments. This study was not suffi-
ciently powered to examine specific demographic
and baseline disease characteristics previously
shown to be associated with QOL in patients with
IBS-D (e.g. sex), and these analyses were not
conducted.24 Finally, this study did not compare
improvement in QOL with patient daily activities,
which are often impaired by IBS.6
In conclusion, patients with IBS-D receiving
short-term (2-week) repeat treatment with rifaxi-
min experienced clinically meaningful improve-
ments in QOL. Furthermore, repeat treatment
with rifaximin provided incremental overall and
subdomain QOL improvement in addition to the
enduring improvement observed following initial

treatment with open-label rifaximin. The
improvements in QOL reported in the current
study further support the clinical usefulness of a
14-day course of rifaximin 550 mg three times a
day as treatment and repeat treatment for the
management of IBS-D.
