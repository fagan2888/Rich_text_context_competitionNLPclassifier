ABSTRACT
Background: Various definitions, criteria, tests, and cutoffs have
been used to define vitamin B-12 status; however, a need exists for
the systematic study of vitamin B-12 status in the United States
because of concerns about high folic acid intakes and the potential
for associated adverse effects.
Objective: The objective was to determine the effect of different
cutoff choices on outcomes and of the different degrees of serum
vitamin B-12 status, definable by the concurrent use of a functional
and circulating marker as the first steps to developing a data-based
consensus on the biochemical diagnosis of vitamin B-12 deficiency.
Design: Data from NHANES, a nationally representative cross-
sectional survey, were examined for adults aged .19 y (mean 6
SD age: 45 6 1 y) from 1999 to 2004 (n = 12,612).
Results: Commonly used cutoffs had a greater effect on prevalence
estimates of low vitamin B-12 status with the use of vitamin B-12
than with the use of methylmalonic acid (MMA; 3­26% and 2­6%,
respectively). A cutoff of .148 pmol/L for vitamin B-12 and of
210 nmol/L for MMA resulted in significant misclassifications.
Approximately 1% of adults had a clear vitamin B-12 deficiency
(low vitamin B-12 and elevated MMA); 92% of adults had adequate
vitamin B-12 status. A high percentage of younger women charac-
terized the group with low vitamin B-12 and normal MMA (2% of
adults) and may have falsely reflected low vitamin B-12. Adults
with elevated MMA (5%) only were demographically similar (ie,
by age and race) to the deficient group and may have included some
individuals with early vitamin B-12 deficiency.
Conclusions: These analyses indicate the challenges of assessing
vitamin B-12 status when uncertainties exist about the appropriate
cutoffs. Future studies should determine definable endpoints to
achieve this goal. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94:552­61.
INTRODUCTION
Vitamin B-12 is essential for DNA synthesis to maintain normal
hematologic and neurologic functions. A marked interest in
monitoring the vitamin B-12 status of the US population was
triggered by the 1996 implementation of the national folic acid
fortification of cereal grains because of concerns that an improved
folate status could adversely affect persons at risk of vitamin B-12
insufficiency, particularly the elderly, for whom a relatively high
prevalence has been reported (1, 2). NHANES has measured 3
biomarkers of vitamin B-12 status over the past 3 decades: serum
vitamin B-12, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and total homo-
cysteine (tHcy) (3). Serum vitamin B-12 directly reflects the range
of circulating vitamin B-12 concentrations in individuals, although
not necessarily tissue concentrations. MMA accumulates in the
absence of adequate vitamin B-12 and is therefore a functional
indicator of vitamin B-12 status (2, 4). Like MMA, tHcy accu-
mulates in the absence of vitamin B-12. However, tHcy is less
specific for vitamin B-12 deficiency than is MMA because it also
accumulates in the absence of other nutrients, such as folate.
The primary challenge with using all biomarkers of vitamin
B-12 status is the lack of scientific consensus regarding cutoffs to
determine low status. This limitation is particularly critical for
identifying individuals with subclinical vitamin B-12 deficiency
who lack clinically relevant endpoints and often depend on other
biomarkers for comparison and validation (3, 5). For serum vi-
tamin B-12 and MMA, commonly used cutoffs often come from
statistical distributions of different populations. Thus, the reference
intervals may be both population and method dependent, and
researchers have published many different cutoffs in the literature.
Another complication is that each biomarker is subject to
sensitivity and specificity limitations. These limitations are par-
ticularly challenging for accurately identifying subclinical vitamin
B-12 deficiency, which is more common than the more severe
clinical deficiency (6). To minimize the effect of these vitamin
B-12 biomarker limitations, experts recommend concurrently
examining a functional biomarker and a biomarker that directly
measures blood vitamin content when assessing vitamin B-12
status (7). However, to our knowledge, NHANES data have not

vitamin B-12 and MMA for assessing vitamin B-12 status in the
US population. We examined NHANES 1999­2004 data on the
combined application of several commonly used cutoffs for serum
vitamin B-12 and MMA to create metabolic profiles to assess the
prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status in the US population.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
NHANES is a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of
the noninstitutionalized US population. The survey uses a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster sampling design. The Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention administers NHANES. NHANES personnel first
interview survey participants in their homes. During this household
interview, interviewers collect information on demographic char-
acteristics, dietary supplement use, and some health-related issues.
Participants undergo a physical examination and blood collection in
a mobile examination center '1­2 wk after the household interview.
They also complete a 24-h dietary recall. Survey personnel obtain
written informed consent from all participants or proxies, and the
Research Ethics Review Board of the National Center for Health
Statistics approved the survey protocol. Interview and examination
response rates for each survey year are publically available (8).
For this study, we combined data from NHANES 1999­2000,
2001­2002, and 2003­2004 (n = 31,126). We excluded data on
anyoneyoungerthan19y(n=14,942),thosewithinterviewdataonly
(ie, lacking mobile examination center data, n = 1160), lactating (n =
145) and pregnant (n = 801) women, and those with missing MMA
data (n = 918). We also excluded data for individuals with high
creatinine concentrations (.120 lmol/L for men, .110 lmol/L for
women; n = 548) because impaired kidney function increases MMA
and tHcy independent of vitamin B-12 status (9). Thus, the final
analytic sample consisted of 12,612 adult participants.
Vitamin B-12 exposure
Dietary supplement information was collected via the
NHANES Dietary Supplement Questionnaire to determine a sam-
ple person's use of vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary
supplements over the past 30 d. Detailed information about name
and type, consumption frequency, duration of use, and amount
taken was collected for each reported dietary supplement. We
calculated the average daily intake of vitamin B-12 from all dietary
supplements using the number of days of reported consumption of
the supplement, the reported amount that respondents took per day,
and the serving size unit from the product label, as we described
previously (10).
Data on one 24-h dietary recall are available for each par-
ticipant for 1999­2002 and for two 24-h dietary recalls for 2003­
2004. We used the average vitamin B-12 intakes from the two
24-h dietary recalls in 2003­2004 instead of trying to adjust the
data for within-person variability to use these data in conjunction
with the 1999­2002 data. Because of limitations in the food-
composition databases, estimates of vitamin B-12 intake in 1999­
2004 do not account for bioavailability differences between
naturally occurring and added vitamin B-12 sources. Added
vitamin B-12 is more bioavailable and is present in fortified foods
and dietary supplements (11). We combined data on the average
daily intake of vitamin B-12 from supplemental sources with the
daily estimates of vitamin B-12 intake from foods to reflect total
vitamin B-12 exposure.
Cognitive test scores
We used a single measure of cognitive function, the Digit
Symbol-Coding (DSC) subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale III (The Psychological Corporation) (12); this instrument,
whereas sensitive, is not comprehensive or indicative of all
domains of cognitive function. The DSC score is the total number
of symbols that participants draw correctly in 120 s. To obtain
a high score on the test, participants must have an adequate speed
of response, attention, and memory (13). We used , 20th per-
centile (scores , 34 on the DSC) to indicate cognitive impair-
ment as previously used by Morris et al (14) in NHANES. DSC
scores were only available for those aged 60 y in NHANES
1999­2002 (n = 2393).
Medications
We used data from the NHANES prescription drug ques-
tionnaire to evaluate the use of prescription medications that may
adversely affect vitamin B-12 status. Within users of NHANES
Class 87 drugs, we identified participants who reported the use of
proton-pump inhibitors and H2
-receptor antagonists (15). No
data were collected on the length of time that participants took
these medications.
Biochemical methods
NHANES 1999­2004 measured serum folate, red blood cell
(RBC) folate, and serum vitamin B-12 using the Quantaphase II
radioassay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). NHANES measured plasma
tHcy using a fluorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit
(Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) (16). NHANES assayed
plasma MMA by gas chromatography­mass spectrometry after
cyclohexanol derivation of the extracted MMA. NHANES 1999­
2000 measured serum creatinine by the Jaffe method using the
Hitachi 917 multichannel analyzer, and NHANES 2001­2004
used the Jaffe rate method (kinetic alkaline picrate) with the
Beckman Synchron LX20 modular chemistry analyzer. We ad-
justed serum creatinine data for NHANES 1999­2000 using the
following equation: 0.147 + 1.013 · uncorrected serum creati-
nine (mg/dL) as the analytic note recommends (17). Complete
details and documentation for each of these methods are pub-
lically available on the NHANES website (18­20).
We applied several cutoff values to the biomarker data to
determine sufficiency and illustrate changes in status (ie, categories
across status). We reviewed serum vitamin B-12 concentrations to
determine the sufficiency using cutoff values of ,148 pmol/L (21­
24), 200 pmol/L (25­27), and 258 pmol/L (7, 28, 29). We also
used vitamin B-12 status based on the cutoffs that Stabler et al
(30) originally proposed and that we modified for this analysis.
The original criteria had 3 concentrations of vitamin B-12 status:
,148 pmol/L (,200 pg/mL), 148­222 pmol/L (200­300
pg/mL), and .223 pmol/L (.300 pg/mL). For this analysis, we
added an additional cutoff of .296 pmol/L (.400 pg/mL) to the
original Stabler et al criteria (30). We classified elevated MMA
using 2 concentrations: .376 nmol/L (31­35) and .271 nmol/L

(24, 28, 32, 36­39). We also examined 4 categories of MMA
based on the above cutoffs (.376 and .271 nmol/L) and .210
nmol/L (14, 23, 40, 41). We defined elevated tHcy as a con-
centration .13 lmol/L (4, 16). High serum folate was defined as
a concentration .59 nmol/L.
Metabolic profiles
We defined 4 metabolic profiles based on combinations of
"normal" and "abnormal" vitamin B-12 and MMA concen-
trations, applying the most frequently used cutoffs for vitamin
B-12 (,148 pmol/L) and MMA (.271 nmol/L). The use of
MMA . 210 nmol/L may falsely elevate prevalence estimates
for deficiency in the elderly because the cutoff was developed
in a younger reference population, whereas the use of .376
nmol/L may underestimate prevalence because it was based
on 3 SD limits and/or patient samples with known low vitamin
B-12 concentrations (1). Profile 1 consisted of a low serum vi-
tamin B-12 concentration together with an elevated MMA
concentration, profile 2 consisted of a low serum vitamin B-12
concentration without an elevated MMA concentration, profile 3
consisted of an elevated MMA concentration without a low vi-
tamin B-12 concentration, and profile 4 consisted of normal
vitamin B-12 and MMA concentrations.
Statistical analysis
We performed all statistical analyses using SAS (version 9;
SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SAS-callable SUDAAN
(version 9; Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
NC) software. We used sample weights with SUDAAN to rep-
resent the US population, account for differential nonresponse
and noncoverage, and adjust for the planned oversampling of
some groups. We estimated SEs for all statistics of interest by
Taylor series linearization.
We estimated descriptive statistics (means, medians, and
percentages/prevalences) for all variables using proc crosstab,
proc descript, and/or proc regress in SAS-callable SUDAAN. We
adjusted for the covariates of sex, age, and race-ethnicity. We also
controlled all group comparisons of biochemical measures for
length of food fasting before blood collection, session of sample
collection, and serum creatinine concentration.

RESULTS
Most individuals in our sample were non-Hispanic white
(72%), and about one-half (51%) were women. The mean age
of the sample was 45 6 1 y, and '10% of the participants were
aged .60 y (data not shown). About 25% of the sample reported
the use of a dietary supplement containing vitamin B-12.
The prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status ranged from 3% to
26%, depending on the serum vitamin B-12 cutoff (Table 1).
When we used ,148 pmol/L as the cutoff, the prevalence of low
vitamin B-12 status was 2.9% and increased significantly with
age, was higher in women than in men, and did not differ by race-
ethnicity. When we used ,200 pmol/L as the cutoff, the preva-
lence of low vitamin B-12 concentrations was '10.6% and
remained higher in those aged 60 y than in those aged 19­39 y
but did not differ from the prevalence in those aged 40­59 y. Non-
Hispanic whites had a higher prevalence than did non-Hispanic

with interview data only (ie, no mobile examination center data, RIDSTATR = 1; n = 1160), high creatinine concentrations (.120 lmol/L for men, .110

plasma MMA by using gas chromatography­mass spectrometry, and plasma homocysteine with a fluorescence polarization immunoassay reagent kit from
Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). The analysis was controlled for age, sex, race-ethnicity, serum creatinine, session of blood collection, and hours of
fasting before blood collection. Values within age, race-ethnicity, and sex groups for a given status category with different superscript letters are significantly
different, P  0.05. Nonnormal variables were log transformed before statistical analysis.

blacks or Mexican Americans, and women were more likely to
have a low vitamin B-12 status than were men. When ,258
pmol/L was used as the cutoff, 25.7% were classified as having
low vitamin B-12 status; however, the prevalence differed sig-
nificantly between all 3 racial-ethnic groups and no longer dif-
fered by age. The higher prevalence of low vitamin B-12 in
women remained constant across all the vitamin B-12 cutoffs.
The prevalence of elevated MMA was 2.3% at a cutoff of 376
nmol/L and 5.8% at a cutoff of 271 nmol/L (Table 1). Regardless of
the cutoff we used, the prevalence of elevated MMA significantly
increased with age, was lower in non-Hispanic blacks than in the
other 2 race-ethnicity groups, and did not differ by sex. About 6%
of the US adult population had elevated tHcy concentrations. The
prevalence of high tHcy concentrations increased with age, was
lower in Mexican Americans than in the other 2 race-ethnicity
groups, and was lower in women than in men.
Vitamin B-12 status groups (modified Stabler approach)
Among the ,3% of the US adult population with vitamin
B-12 concentrations ,148 pmol/L, only 22­44% had elevated
MMA concentrations (depending on the cutoff), and only 32%
had elevated tHcy concentrations (Table 2). Another 13% of US
adults had serum vitamin B-12 concentrations of 148 to 222
pmol/L, and an additional 22% had vitamin B-12 concentrations
of 223 to 296 pmol/L. Most US adults (62%) had serum vitamin
B-12 concentrations .296 pmol/L. Of this group, only a small
percentage (,10%) had elevated MMA or tHcy concentrations.
Each successive cutoff rise showed a significant inverse linear
trend across the vitamin B-12 groups with regard to MMA and
tHcy; the prevalence of elevated MMA (regardless of the cutoff
used) and tHcy decreased with increasing vitamin B-12 cutoff.
RBC and serum folate concentrations increased with increasing
vitamin B-12 status. We observed a trend toward increasing
prevalence of high serum folate concentrations with increasing
vitamin B-12 concentrations.
The use of vitamin B-12­containing dietary supplements and the
amount of vitamin B-12 that users consumed was highest in
respondents with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations .296 pmol/L.
Vitamin B-12 intake from the diet and total vitamin B-12 intake
(from diet + supplements in users and nonusers combined) in-
creased with serum vitamin B-12 status. The use of proton pump
inhibitors and H2
-receptor antagonists had no relation with vitamin
B-12 status. Cognitive function scores increased, and the preva-
lence of impairment decreased across increasing serum vitamin
B-12 concentrations for adults aged 60 y. We found no sig-
nificant differences in mean corpuscular volume (MCV) or in the
prevalence of macrocytosis across vitamin B-12 groupings (data
not shown).
MMA status groups
We examined the data for 4 groups defined by their MMA
concentrations (Table 3). Very few people had MMA concen-
trations .376 nmol/L (2.3%), but 27­66% of this group had
a low serum vitamin B-12 concentration (depending on the vi-
tamin B-12 cutoff); another 3% had MMA concentrations of 272
to 376 nmol/L, and yet another 8% had concentrations of 210 to
271 nmol/L. Most ('86%) had MMA concentrations ,210
nmol/L; of this group, '2% had low vitamin B-12 concen-
trations (,148 pmol/L).
As MMA increased, so did the mean age of the groups and the
prevalence of those aged .60 y. The percentage of the group that
was of non-Hispanic black ethnicity decreased as MMA con-
centrations increased. The prevalence of low vitamin B-12 status
increased across increasing MMA concentration categories with
all cutoffs. Similarly, tHcy and the percentage of US adults with
elevated tHcy concentrations increased with increasing MMA
concentration categories. We found no differences in MCV con-
centrations or in the prevalence of macrocytosis (data not shown).
Both serum and RBC folate concentrations decreased across in-
creasing MMA categories. We observed a trend toward increasing
prevalence in those with high serum folate with decreasing MMA
concentrations.
Use of dietary supplements containing vitamin B-12 and vi-
tamin B-12 intake from supplements increased with decreasing
MMA concentration categories. Dietary vitamin B-12 intakes
had no relation with MMA concentrations, but total vitamin B-12
dietary exposure had a significant inverse relation with MMA
concentrations. The use of proton pump inhibitor or H2
-receptor
antagonist medications had no relation with MMA concentration
categories. Cognitive function scores decreased and the preva-
lence of impairment increased with increasing MMA categories.
About 40% of those with the highest MMA concentrations (.376
nmol/L) had cognitive impairment.
Metabolic profiles based on MMA and vitamin B-12
biomarkers together
About 1% of the adult US adult population had low serum
vitamin B-12 and elevated MMA concentrations (profile 1; Table
4); in addition to the very high MMA concentration (mean 6
SE: 813 6 93 nmol/L), tHcy was also quite elevated (mean: 18
lmol/L); 65% had concentrations .13 lmol. This profile thus
reflected vitamin B-12 deficiency, often of more than a mild
degree. Profile 2 (low vitamin B-12 with normal MMA con-
centrations, 2%) and profile 3 (normal vitamin B-12 with ele-
vated MMA concentrations, 5%) were slightly more common.
Profile 4, making up 92% of the study population, had both
normal vitamin B-12 and MMA, which suggests that this profile
reflected normal vitamin B-12 status.
Falling between the 2 poles, profile 2 (low vitamin B-12 with
normal MMA) and profile 3 (normal vitamin B-12 with elevated
MMA) accounted for 2% and 5% of the population, respectively.
Demographically, profile 3 resembled the vitamin B-12­deficient
profile1inmeanage,proportion.60yofage,sexdistribution,and
ethnic distribution, including a low proportion of non-Hispanic
blacks. Profile 2, on the other hand, resembled the vitamin B-12­
sufficient profile 4 in having the fewest subjects .60 y of age and in
ethnic distribution; profile 2 also had the lowest proportion of men in
the study.
Serum vitamin B-12 and MMA differed significantly, in part, as
expected from selection, but also unexpectedly because even the
"normal" values inprofiles 2 and 3 differed from the normal valuesin
profile 4 and the "abnormal" values differed from profile 1 (Table 4).
Profiles2and3hadsimilarconcentrationsoftHcy,withameanwithin
the reference interval, but differed significantly from both profiles 1
and 4. The same pattern was evident for RBC folate concentrations.

DISCUSSION
The nationally representative data in this article confirm most
of the broader, previously reported demographic findings relevant
to vitamin B-12 status (ie, relations with age, race, and sex). We
extend that existing information by exploring in greater depth the
influence of cutoffs on population outcomes and characteristics
and by analyzing the interactions between concurrent vitamin
B-12 and MMA changes more closely because of the diagnostic
limitations of every biomarker when it stands alone.
Four metabolic profiles have emerged from an examination
of the concurrent use of serum vitamin B-12 and MMA con-
centrations to assess vitamin B-12 status in NHANES (Table 4,
Figure 1). Profile 1 had a high likelihood of vitamin B-12

deficiency; although the prevalence was low (1%, one-half of
whom were .60 y of age), it represented a large absolute
number of Americans (n = 1,694,748). Moreover, the high mean
MMA (813 nmol/L) and tHcy (18 lmol/L) concentrations
suggest that many of the subjects had more advanced vitamin
B-12 deficiency and were at a considerable health risk if un-
diagnosed and untreated. Indeed, the prevalence resembled that
of pernicious anemia in the elderly (42). Profiles 2 and 3, each
with one normal and one abnormal biomarker, were more prob-
lematic but also presented a more important challenge to resolve
because their respective 2% and 5% prevalences far exceeded the
1% prevalence of profile 1. Profile 4 included 92% of the pop-
ulation and probably represented vitamin B-12 adequacy because
vitamin B-12 and MMA (and tHcy) are all within usual reference
ranges. Profiles 2 and 3 were similar in their intermediacy between
the healthy profile 4 and the deficient profile 1, but they may re-
flect different underlying metabolic processes and types of affected
persons. Profile 2, with isolated vitamin B-12 abnormality, may
have mainly represented falsely low vitamin B-12 concentrations;
the mean MMA (and tHcy) concentrations were slightly higher
than those in the presumably nondeficient profile 4, but they were
nevertheless far below the most liberal cutoff for abnormality.
Profile 2 also resembled the "normal" profile 4, demographically,
much more closely than it resembled profile 1, for which the age

was higher and the frequency of non-Hispanic blacks was lower.
As summarized elsewhere, 22% of individuals with vitamin
B-12 concentrations ,148 pmol/L in surveys had no deficiency, as
measured by other metabolic tests, and thus were likely to have
low vitamin B-12 concentrations secondary to another cause (5, 7).
Profile 2 may include individuals with an often genetic TC I de-
ficiency, the frequency of which may be higher than that of per-
nicious anemia, and in whom serum vitamin B-12 is low but
MMA and tHcy are not abnormal (39) or individuals who lack the
common fucosyltransferase polymorphism associated with higher
vitamin B-12 concentrations (43). Given the high proportion of
younger women in profile 2, many of the low vitamin B-12 con-
centrations may have been affected by hormonal factors unrelated
to functional vitamin B-12 status. For example, in women aged
19­39 y, oral contraceptive users had significantly lower mean
serum vitamin B-12 concentrations than did nonusers (290 com-
pared with 412 pmol/L; P , 0.001; data not shown). Additional
heterogeneity must also be considered; 17% of profile 2 subjects
had elevated tHcy, and some may have had mild vitamin B-12
deficiency, despite having normal MMA concentrations.
Profile 3 was characterized by a high MMA concentration
alone; serum vitamin B-12 concentrations were within the de-
fined normal range. This group may have reflected the superior
sensitivity of MMA to vitamin B-12 in mild, purely biochemical
vitamin B-12 deficiency (44), which may predominate in profile
3, as also suggested by the demographic similarities of profile 3 to
profile 1; the significantly lower MMA elevation than in profile 1
suggests that the vitamin B-12 deficiency, if present, was milder.
However, others in profile 3 may also have represented falsely
elevated MMA concentrations for reasons not related to vitamin
B-12 status (5). Our results indicate that only 22% of profile 3 had
an elevated tHcy concentration. It is also notable that, within
profile 3, those with elevated tHcy were older (63 compared with
50 y), were more likely to be male (57% compared with 47%),
were more likely to be non-Hispanic black (6% compared with
3%), and had a lower mean vitamin B-12 concentration (249
compared with 309 pmol/L) compared with those without ele-
vated tHcy (differences were statistically significant, data not
shown). Taken together, these findings suggest that individuals
with vitamin B-12 insufficiency may represent only a minor
fraction of those with metabolic profile 3. Vogiatzoglou et al (9)
found that identified determinants (age, creatinine, and serum
vitamin B-12) accounted for ,17% of the variation in plasma
MMA.
MMA concentrations are highly dependent on kidney function
and serum creatinine (9), even within the normal range (45). We
excluded those with high serum creatinine concentrations, which
are indicative of serious renal impairment, but also recognized
that some residual effect on MMA concentrations might occur in
persons with milder renal impairment. For this reason, we also
statistically controlled every analysis for serum creatinine
concentrations.
Misclassification of vitamin B-12 status
The consequences of extending the cutoff for serum vitamin
B-12 beyond 148 pmol/L are clearly shown in Table 2. Only
6­26% (depending on demographic subset) of the added cohort
with serum vitamin B-12 concentrations of 148 to 222 pmol/L
had abnormal MMA concentrations and only 14% had elevated
tHcy concentrations, and the loss of diagnostic specificity was
even greater for the added cohort with vitamin B-12 concentrations
of 223 to 296 pmol/L (2­14% abnormal MMA and 7% abnormal
tHcy). Approximately 80% of the subjects in the 2 extended vi-
tamin B-12 interval categories did not have an elevated MMA
concentration (based on .271 nmol), and 79% did not have an
elevated tHcy concentration. The findings suggest an unacceptable
degree of false-positive misclassification of vitamin B-12 in-
sufficiency when a vitamin B-12 cutoff . 148 pmol/L is used.
Cutoff challenges
The use of biomarker cutoffs of vitamin B-12 to estimate the
prevalence of inadequate nutrient status is challenging. As our
data show (Table 1), different cutoffs result in very different
prevalence estimates (3­26% for low serum vitamin B-12 and
2.3­5.8% for elevated MMA); the prevalence estimates change to
a greater degree for serum vitamin B-12 than for plasma MMA.
Moving the vitamin B-12 cutoff up in 25­30% increments from
148 to 200 and then to 258 pmol/L increases the rates of subjects
identified as low vitamin B-12 from 2.9% to 10.6% and then to
25.7%, respectively (Table 1). Moving MMA cutoffs down by
a similar percentage from 376 to 271 nmol/L had smaller effect
on rates of subjects identified as "high MMA" (from 2.3% to
5.8%; Table 1). Only when the MMA cutoff was set at 210
nmol/L did the rate of abnormality reach 13.8% (Table 3). The

2002, and 2003­2004. We excluded data from respondents with interview

MMA cutoff shift also did not shift the demographic distribution
as much as did changes in vitamin B-12 cutoff.
Cognitive function
In older adults, the prevalence of cognitive impairment was
higher with lower vitamin B-12 status and elevated MMA
concentrations. We saw a significant linear trend with both raw
scores on cognitive function and the prevalence of cognitive
impairment across vitamin B-12 and MMA status (Tables 2 and
3). About 40% of the highest MMA group (.376 nmol/L) had
cognitive impairment (Table 3). The 2 metabolic profiles with
elevated MMA concentrations had lower cognitive scores and
a higher prevalence of impairment than did the profiles without
elevated MMA concentrations (Table 4). On this basis, it is
tempting to conclude that MMA may be a better biomarker for
cognitive function than serum vitamin B-12 in older adults.
However, these data must be interpreted with caution. First,
NHANES data are cross-sectional in nature, so we cannot infer
a cause-and-effect relation between MMA concentrations and
cognitive function. Second, important confounders may be at-
tributed to the relations; individuals in the profiles with poorer
cognitive function were also older. Third, cognitive status is
complex and difficult to measure; it is related to educational and
socioeconomic status--neither of which were examined here.
Thus, more data are needed before we can accurately interpret
the relation between MMA and cognitive function in older
adults. In NHANES 2013­2014, a more complete battery of
cognitive function tests will be available.
Study limitations
The ideal approach for defining appropriate cutoffs for
NHANES and other applications would be to conduct clinical
trials in which a quantitative relation between biomarker con-
centrations and the appearance of clinical outcomes of presumed
vitamin B-12 inadequacy is established and in which the mea-
surement of the biomarkers is traceable to a higher order reference
method (46). Unfortunately, this type of information cannot be
obtained from a cross-sectional study such as NHANES, which
cannot establish causality between biomarker concentrations
and outcomes. However, our findings may prove useful for
informing the design of interventional population-based trials
designed to assess the effects of vitamin B-12 repletion through
supplementation.
Currently, no consensus exists on the appropriate cutoffs for
assessing serum vitamin B-12 and MMA status, particularly for
population-based monitoring purposes. The approach and criteria
used, the study population, and the measurement procedure can
all affect the relevance of published cutoffs. The most appropriate
cutoffs for assessing vitamin B-12 status when using NHANES
data remain elusive, which has resulted in considerable un-
certainty about the vitamin B-12 status of the US population.
Future studies should seek to determine a definable clinical
endpoint to achieve this goal. Until this is established, we cannot
accurately estimate the public health burden of vitamin B-12
deficiency in the United States.
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--All authors contributed to
the concept development and manuscript preparation and read and approved
the final version of this manuscript. RC has submitted a patent application for
work related to transcobalamin I deficiency and its genetic aspects. RG is
a consultant for Emisphere and served on the scientific advisory board of
