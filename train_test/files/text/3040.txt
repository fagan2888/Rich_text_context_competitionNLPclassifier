Gravidity, Blood Pressure, and Hypertension among White Women in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Roberta B. Ness,1 Rachel A. Kramer,2 and Katherine M. Flegal2




Gravidity and parity have been hypothesized as possible protective factors for hypertension in women , but results of previous studies have been conflicting; none of three U.S. studies has clearly demonstrated this relation. We studied
            e association of nuriiliei-ofpregnanc1es to blood pieSSUre and hypertension in a cross-sectional study of 4,626 white women, ages 20- 74 years, examined in the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In univariate analyses, neither mean systolic blood pressure, mean diastolic blood pressure, nor prevalence of hypertension varied sys­ tematically with the number of pregnancies. In multivariate analyses that included age, body size, smoking, oral contra-

ceptive use, education, poverty status, and alcohol use, sys­ tolic blood pressure declined modestly with greater gravidity. The association of gravidity with systolic blood pressure was stronger for younger premenopausal women. The odds of hn,ertension also declined  with  each  additional ancy as compared with no pregnancies: there was an odds ratio of
0.90 (95 % confidence interval= 0.81-0.99) for  premenopau- sal women and an odds ratio of0.95 (95 % confidence interval
= 0.92-0 .98) for postmenopausal women . These findings indicate a slight negative relation of number of pregnancies to both blood pressure and hypertension . (Epidemiology 1993;4:303-309)

The current study further examines the relations among gravidity, blood pressure, and hypertension for white women, using data from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II). These data allow the association between gravidity and blood pressure to be examined with control for several potentially confounding factors and in the con­ text of the most recently completed comprehensive national health examination survey in the United States.

Methods
The NHANES II survey, conducted from 1976 to 1980 by the National Center for Health Statistics, was de­ signed to estimate the  health and nutritional status of a probability sample of noninstitutionalized U.S. civil­ ians age 6 months to 74 years. The design and opera­ tion of the survey are described in detail elsewhere. 16 This analysis uses data from white women between


303




the ages of 20 and 74 years who were examined in the survey. Women whose race was observed by the inter­ viewer to be "black" or "other" were not included because of inadequate sample size. Also excluded were women who were currently breastfeeding, who had had a pregnancy ending within the past 12 months, or who reported never having had a menstrual period. After these exclusions, the sample contained 2,097 premenopausal women and 2,999 postmenopausal women.
  Potential sources of nonresponse in the  NHANES II have been discussed by other authors 17 and include nonresponse during the interview or the examination. Approximately 89% of white women responded to the request for interview, and 75.8% of those interviewed were examined. A previous analysis of selected health variables of persons examined vs those who were in­ terviewed but not examined indicated no substantial bias due to nonresponse.18

BLOOD PREssURE/HYPERTENSION
Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphyg­ momanometer according to a standardized study pro­ tocol.16 Two seated blood pressure measurements were averaged to obtain mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures. Hypertension was defined according to the recommendations of the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure 19 as any of the following: taking medication for hypertension, having a mean systolic blood pres­ sure 140 mmHg, or having a mean diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg.

REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY
Women were asked how many pregnancies and how many livebirths they had had. Gravidity was defined as the total number of recalled pregnancies, and parity was defined as the total number of recalled livebirths. Parity and gravidity are highly correlated. Both vari­
ables behaved similarly as predictors of blood pressure in this study and in other studies12.15; only the results for gravidity (number of pregnancies) are  presented here.

COVARIATES
Menopause
Women who answered "yes" to the question, "Have your periods stopped entirely-not counting preg­ nancy" were considered to be postmenopausal. Women were divided into two groups: premenopausal women younger than age 45 years (88% of premeno­ pausal women); and postmenopausal women age 45 or


older (93% of postmenopausal women). This stratifi­ cation allowed control for menopausal status and elim­ ination of extreme and unusual combinations of age and menopause . The final sample included 1,841 pre­ menopausal women and 2,785 postmenopausal women .
Age
Women were divided into six age groups (20-24, 25- 34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74) in univariate analyses, based on age at the time of the household interview.
Oral Contraceptive Use
Women age 20-44 years were defined as oral contra­ ceptive users if they reported current use of "birth control pills," and as non-users otherwise.
Anthropometric Measurements
Body weight and height were measured according to standardized study protocols; subjects wore light cloth­ ing and no shoes. Measurements of triceps and subsca­ pular skinfold thicknesses were determined using calipers that were periodically recalibrated and stand­ ardized. Multiple readings were taken on the right side of the body until two readings agreed to within 1 mm.20 Two continuous indices of overall adiposity were used: body mass index, defined as (weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)\ and the sum of triceps plus subscapular skinfold measurements, log trans­ formed to reduce skewness. The log-transformed ratio of triceps/subscapular skinfolds was used as a measure of body fat distribution.
Education
The educational level was the highest grade reported, divided into categories of elementary, some  high school, high school graduate, and some college.  In some analyses, educational level was collapsed to form two categories: high school graduate (high school grad­ uate or some college); or not high school graduate (elementary or some high school).
Poverty Index Ratio
The combined family income was standardized by dividing by a poverty threshold that was adjusted for number of family members, family composition, age and sex of the household head, place of residence, and yearly inflation on a national basis.16 Ratios of <1 are below the poverty level, and ratios of 1 are at  or above the poverty level.
Alcohol Consumption
Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire in which consumption of alcoholic beverages during the 3 months preceding the interview was categorized




as none (never), less than once per week (seldom),  one to six times per week (weekly), or one or more times  per day (daily). The greatest frequency of reported alcohol consumption for any class (beer , wine, or liquor) was chosen as an indicator of habitual use.17
Current Smoking
Women who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime and who reported cur­ rently smoking were contrasted to all others .

DAT A ANALYSIS
Age-specific means and frequencies were calculated by level of gravidity and hypertensive status. These uni-
   iate estimates incorporated weights and  the c omplex


vidity for premenopausal women (Table 1). Premeno­ pausal women with greater numbers of pregnancies were on average older and of larger body size and were less likely to have a high school education, to drink alcohol weekly or daily, and to use oral contraceptives. For postmenopausal women, education and alcohol use followed the same pattern, but mean age was slightly lower with increased numbers of pregnancies. Women with hypertension differed from normoten­ sive women on a variety of characteristics (Table 2).

Contraceptives



Hypertensive women were generally older and oflarger body size. The mean weighted body mass index of hypertensive women exceeded that of normotensive women by 3.0-5.8 kg per m2 Compared with normo­ tensive women, women with hypertension were less likely to be smokers, to drink weekly or daily, to have a high school education, and (for premenopausal women) to be oral contraceptive users.
  One might expect greater mean systolic blood pres­ sures and a higher prevalence of hypertension, partic­ ularly among premenopausal multigravid women, who tended to be older, larger, less well educated, less likely to drink alcohol daily or weekly, and less likely to currently use oral contraceptives. A history of a greater number of pregnancies, however, did not convey a higher mean systolic blood pressure (Table 3), a higher mean diastolic blood pressure (data not shown), or a higher risk of hypertension (Table 4) within any 10- year age group.
  In multiple linear regression models that included other potential risk factors for elevations in blood pressure, systolic blood pressure declined modestly with greater gravidity (Table 5). For premenopausal women, the change in systolic blood pressure with each additional pregnancy was -0.5 mmHg (standard error 0.21 mmHg). An interaction between age and

gravidity suggested that the observed association was greater for younger premenopausal women (linear regression coefficient for gravidity -4.21, standard er­ ror 0.87; coefficient for age-gravidity interaction 0.11, standard error 0.03). For example, with each additional pregnancy, the estimated change in systolic blood pres­ sure for 25-year-old premenopausal women, taking into account the interaction term between age and gravidity, was - 1.5 mmHg. For postmenopausal women, the estimated change in systolic blood pressure with each additional pregnancy was -0.4 mmHg (standard error 0.17 mmH g).
  Multiple linear regression models, including poten­ tial risk factors, were also analyzed for diastolic blood pressure. The regression coefficient of gravidity was small and negative for both pre- and postmenopausal women . As with systolic blood pressure, the effect was greater in younger women, so that among 25-year-old premenopausal women, the estimated change in dia­ stolic blood pressure, taking into account the interac­ tion between age and gravidity, was -0.7 mmHg for each additional pregnancy. For postmenopausal women, the estimated change was -0.2 mmHg (stand­ ard error 0.11) for each additional pregnancy.

postmenopausal women were age and body size. Oral contraceptive use (among premenopausal women) and not currently smoking were less strongly related to systolic blood pressure. Lack of educational attainment and central body fat distribution clearly related to greater systolic blood pressure only in postmenopausal

ity is negatively associated both with hypertension and
with systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Our obser­ vations that multigravid women were older, more often overweight, and less well educated than less gravid women are consistent with other reports.24 25 Also consistent with the results of previous studies was our finding that hypertension was associated with age, body mass index, body fat distribution, and (in older women) lower educational attainment.26 28
  A number of previous studies have examined the relation between reproductive history and blood pres­ sure or hypertension , including three  studies  carried out in the United States.12 13 15 Baird and Quinlivan,12 using data from the National Health Examination Sur­ vey (a smaller forerunner to the NHANES surveys conducted from 1960 to 1962), found no relation between gravidity and systolic or diastolic blood pres­ sure after controlling for age and body weight. More recently, Kritz-Silverstein et al15 also found no associ­ ation between parity or gravidity and hypertension or blood pressure after controlling for a variety of co­ variates such as age, obesity, alcohol intake, cigarette smoking, exercise, and estrogen use. That study, how­ ever, examined a cross-sectional cohort of older white women (age 50 or more) who were of relatively high socioeconomic status and generally low gravidity. Fi­ nally, Lee-Feldstein et al13 analyzed blood pressures of 755 Detroit, MI, area women of high and low "stress"




groups (defined in terms of socioeconomic status) and concluded that there was no association between white women's reported numbers of livebirths and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Their data are remarkable for a negative trend between parity and systolic blood pressure for white high-stress females after adjusting for age, percentage overweight, race, and stress effect s. Other work has supported a negative association between reproductive history and blood pressure-3 8 among populations of women from other countries who tended to be younger, have lower blood pressure, higher levels of gravidity, and lower living standards than U.S. women. For our sample, there was a stronger association between reproductive factors and hyper­
tension or systolic blood pressure for younger premen­ opausal women than for postmenopausal women . Fea­ tures of our data that may account for its being the first study of U.S. white women to show clear negative associations among gravidity, hypertension, an d .sys­ tolic blood pressure include the following: a large study size resulting in an adequate number of both premen­ opausal and postmenopausal multigravid women to provide stable estimates, and control for several con­ founding factors, including educational level and body fat distribution, that have generally not been controlled for in past studies.
  Weaknesses of our data include its generalizability to white women only and the cross-sectional nature of the data. The survey included a retrospective history of pregnancy, yet measurement of blood pressure at the time of examination reflects only current status. In these data, we cannot be certain whether increased gravidity led to lower blood pressure, or whether initially lower blood pressure was related to a greater tendency to subsequently have more pregnancies.
  The negative relation of current smoking to blood pressure and hypertension found here might be partly due to physicians recommending smoking cessation to patients with higher blood pressures. These respond­ ents could then be less likely to be smokers. Could such a medical attention bias also account for the negative association between gravidity and blood pres­ sure? Such a hypothesis is plausible because, particu­ larly for younger women, medical attention may be sought only in the context of pregnancy.  We found  no evidence for this, however. Increased gravidity was not associated with higher use of antihypertensive medications. Also, excluding women on antihyperten­ sive medications had no impact on the association between gravidity and systolic blood pressure.
  Possible physiologic mechanisms for the negative association between number of pregnancies and blood


pressure are unknown, although a speculative possi­ bility is that it may be related to the repeated adaptation of the vascular system to the increase in plasma volume that occurs during pregnancy.29 We conclude that, for this national sample of white women, there is a small negative association of number of pregnancies both with blood pressure and with hypertension in the context of potential confounding risk factors . The physiologic mechanisms responsible for this negative association are still unclear but present an area for further research. A better understanding of this rela­ tion might help to elucidate both the mechanisms of blood pressure control and the long-term effects of repeated pregnancies on women's health.
