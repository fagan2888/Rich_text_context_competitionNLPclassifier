in Chinese children. Obes Res. 2003;11:957­961.
Objective: To examine patterns of inactivity and snacking
and their relationship with overweight status in Chinese
children.
Research Methods and Procedures: The study population
was drawn from the 1997 China Health National Survey
(1385 children, ages 6 to 11 years), conducted with a
representative sample from nine provinces. The 2000 Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention BMI charts were
used to calculate "at risk of overweight" as those above the
85th percentile. Three days of 24-hour recall dietary data
and detailed questions on physical activity and inactivity for
the previous 7 days were used.
Results: 9.4% of the children were classified as overweight.
Weekly mean and range of hours spent watching television/
videos, playing video games, studying, and in inactive
transport were 5.1 (0 to 35), 0.3 (0 to 10), 4.7 (0 to 60), and
0.14 (0 to 4.2), respectively. Television/video viewing and
studying did not differ in any meaningful manner between
overweight and normal weight children. Snacking is incon-
sequential in China, comprising only 0.9% of energy intake.
Discussion: Chinese children are less overweight, less in-
active, and less likely to ingest calories as snacks than
children in the U.S. The absence of impact of these mea-
sures of inactivity, which are below an hour per day for the
average Chinese child, indicate the possible value of limit-
ing television viewing and other types of inactivity in other
countries. Modern Western-style television programming
and advertising started to come to China after 1997; there-
fore, extensive changes in television viewing patterns are
expected to emerge.
Key words: BMI, television, video games, studying, in-
active transport
Introduction
Extensive research in the United States and a few other
countries has documented the effect of high levels of inac-
tivity and television viewing on childhood obesity, but little
research has been undertaken in countries where the expo-
sure to television has not been long term and where levels of
television viewing have not been at very high levels except
among selected children. China, where pediatric obesity is
less prevalent but growing rapidly, is a most useful case
(1,2). Obesity, in both children and adults, is associated with
significant morbidity and mortality from chronic conditions
(3). Perhaps surprisingly, increased physical inactivity, es-
pecially television viewing, has been found to be more
closely associated with obesity than increases in recall mea-
sures of physical activity (4). In fact, only previous obesity
is more closely associated with current obesity than is
television viewing in some studies (5). Theories to explain
this association stem from the decreased physical activity,
increased snacking and consumption of high-fat, high-sugar
foods, and decreased resting metabolic rate associated with
television viewing (6,7). Not only can television viewing
replace time spent in physically active pursuits, but it may
also condition the child who is not hungry to snack when-
ever he or she is watching television (8).
Most studies use children who watch 2 hours or less of
television per day as the reference group, but this is usually
a unique sample. Some investigators have found a variation
in the risk of overweight at levels of inactivity less than 2
hours per day. For example, Anderson et al. found that
children ages 8 to 16 years who watched 1 hour or less of
television per day had statistically significantly lower BMIs
than children who watched 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 4 or more
hours of television per day. (Boys and girls ages 8 to 10
years had the highest prevalence of television viewing in the

1 or less hour per day category compared with children ages
11 to 13 and 14 to 16 years) (9). Thus, although the
American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that parents
limit their children's viewing of television to 2 hours or less
per day (10), it may be that limiting television viewing to 1
hour or less per day would promote the healthiest BMI in
children. Longitudinal and other research is needed to ex-
plore such issues and to determine whether such a cause-
and-effect relationship exists that warrants changing the
American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines and other sim-
ilar recommendations.
The most consistent research on this issue comes from the
United States, supplemented by studies from Mexico City,
both of which have very high levels of television viewing
and childhood obesity (5,11). In the United States and
Mexico City, children watch 23 and 17 hours of television
per week, respectively; this is more time than they spend in
any other activity except sleeping (5,11,12). Not only is
television viewing felt to affect obesity through the reduc-
tion of energy expenditure, but several investigators note
that children snack widely during their viewing of television
(6,7). Snacking among U.S. children is an important source
of energy (13).
Television is in an earlier stage of incorporation into the
culture in China than in the United States and Mexico.
Television ownership and channel availability vary widely
by geographic location in China. Except for the modern
Hong Kong Star network that provides TV programming
equivalent to that found in the United States, other program-
ming is less focused on the modern shows and advertise-
ments that might encourage child viewing. (At the time of
this survey, only a very small proportion of Chinese house-
holds in this sample had Hong Kong Star.) The purpose of
this study is to examine the prevalence of overweight and
patterns of inactivity and snacking behavior, major contrib-
utors to pediatric overweight in the United States and other
countries, in a population of children that has not yet as-
similated television into its culture as profoundly as has the
United States. Specific questions to be explored include the
following. "What is the prevalence of overweight in Chi-
nese children?" "How much time are Chinese children
inactive?" "Do the inactivity patterns in Chinese children
differ by overweight status?" "To what extent does snacking
play a role in the diet of Chinese children?"
Research Methods and Procedures
The study population consisted of 1385 Chinese children
6 to 11 years of age living in nine geographically diverse
provinces of China in 1997. All data were collected for the
China Health National Survey, an ongoing, longitudinal
survey. The purpose of this survey was to assess the effect
of socioeconomic change on health-related behaviors and
health outcomes, including physical activity (and inactivity)
and child overweight. Details on the survey design and data
for the children are found elsewhere (14,15). Dietary data
were based on 3 days of a combination of weighing house-
hold food intake and three consecutive 24-hour recalls (15).
Physicians obtained the anthropometry in a clinical setting,
and the remaining data were obtained from in-home inter-
views. BMI was calculated as weight divided by height
squared and compared with the 2000 National Center for
Health Statistics Growth Charts, the most recent U.S. ref-
erence, which is recommended by the World Health Orga-
nization for international comparisons (16). "At risk of
overweight" and "overweight" were defined as greater than
the 85th or 95th percentile of BMI, respectively. Because of
the small percentage of the study population in the "over-
weight" category, these categories were combined and are
heretofore referred to jointly as "overweight." Height,
weight, and inactivity data were available for 880 of the
1358 children 6 to 11 years of age.
An eating occasion was defined as a "snack" if it oc-
curred outside of usual mealtimes. Inactivity was con-
structed by summing the total minutes per week spent
viewing television, playing video tapes or games, studying,
or in inactive transport such as car, bus, subway, or riding
on a bike pedaled by an adult. Activities at school were
classified as "active" or "inactive" time. For example, read-
ing was categorized as inactive time, but gymnastics was
categorized as active time. All data on physical inactivity
was collected by self-report from both the parent and the
child.
Participant characteristics, inactive time, and snacking
behaviors in the overweight and nonoverweight groups
were compared using Student's t tests. Children with miss-
ing dietary and physical activity data, representing 3% of
the sample, were excluded from analysis, and no systematic
sample selectivity bias was found.
Results
Characteristics of the overweight and nonoverweight
samples are presented in Table 1. Compared with children
living in rural areas, a higher percentage of urban children
were overweight (df  1, 2  5.76, p  0.02). The income
of the households of the overweight children was signifi-
cantly lower than that of the households of the nonover-
weight children (df  160, t  2.28, p  t  0.02). The
BMI z score of the overweight children was significantly
higher than that of the nonoverweight children (df  228,
t  37.58, p  t   0.0001).
The mean times spent in the various components of
inactivity were similar for children ages 6 to 8 and 9 to 11,
so these data are combined in Tables 2 and 3. As shown in
Table 2, a significant proportion of the children never watch
television, and this proportion was considerably higher
among the overweight group (78% vs. 59%), although this
was not statistically significant. The only statistically sig-
nificant difference was the additional 1.8 hours per week or

15 minutes per day of television viewing among the
nonoverweight group--a difference that is not behaviorally
very different. Of note, our data show that in 1997, almost
none of the households had access to modern television
(e.g., Hong Kong Star programming that includes content
from the West and the Chinese equivalent). Furthermore, a
large proportion of the children did not engage in inactive
transportation when they traveled to school, so the mean
amount of inactive travel time was minuscule. Chinese
children spent almost as much time studying (4.8 h/wk) as
they did watching television (5.3 h/wk), emphasizing the
importance of studying as a component of children's inac-
tivity in China. Video tapes and games and inactive trans-
port (such as car, train, bus, or riding on a bike pedaled by
an adult) contributed to a small percentage of inactive time
in this population (0.3 and 0.14 h/wk, respectively).
Analyses of snacking behavior found that 11.0% of the
Chinese participants reported consuming calories as snacks.
The mean percent of total energy from snacks for all chil-
dren in the sample was 0.9% and that in snackers was 7.8%.
Mean percent of total energy from snacks among all chil-
dren in the sample and among only those who snacked did
not differ significantly by overweight status or by urban vs.
rural residence.
Discussion
One reason that it is important to study the relationship of
inactivity to childhood obesity in various populations is

because diet and activity patterns vary widely in different
cultures. This study has demonstrated that a country with
very low levels of television viewership and little snacking
does not demonstrate the same levels of overweight nor the
same relationships with inactivity measures that are found
in the United States. Inactive time and snacking behavior in
these countries are strikingly different. Whereas Chinese
children spend a median of 5.1 h/wk watching television
and a median of 0.3 h/wk playing video games, U.S. chil-
dren watch a median of 23 h/wk of television and spend a
median of 7.3 h/wk playing video games. Only 11% of
Chinese children snack, and both snackers and nonsnackers
obtain a very small proportion of their total calories from
snacks (7.8% and 0.9%, respectively). However, Jahns et al.
(13) found that 91% of U.S. children of the same age range
snack, and both snackers and nonsnackers obtain a large
proportion of their daily calories from snacks (24% and
18.9%, respectively). Also, 69.0% of the children in this
study population walked to school, which is likely a greater
percentage than in the United States, where many children
are transported to school in a school bus or car. Elsewhere,
we have shown how important transportation is for child
activity patterns and for obesity among adults (17,18).
Whatever the reason for these differences, they point to
potential causes for inactivity and its negative effects in the
United States.
Aside from the limited number of intervention studies, it
is hard to unravel cause and effect in studying the role of
television viewing in the United States and other high
television-viewing societies. Whereas the choice to view
television is often linked causally with overweight status
and overall activity level, even longitudinal observational
studies have difficulty in ascertaining causality. Moreover,
television viewing is an integral part of U.S. culture, and
there is a relatively high level of viewing among even the
most active children. Interventional studies that have dem-
onstrated that decreasing inactivity is an effective means to
combat obesity in children assist us in interpretation, but
even these studies might be limited by selectivity and im-
plementation biases (5). Thus, decreasing inactive time is a
promising target for intervention, and, therefore, the asso-
ciation between inactivity and overweight needs to be stud-
ied in depth.
The comparison of these Chinese results with studies
from the United States suggests that there may be a thresh-
old of hours of television viewing above which television is
associated with obesity and below which it is not. Andersen
et al. found that boys and girls ages 8 to 16 years who
watched 2 to 3 hours of television per day were at risk to
have a statistically significantly higher BMI than children in
this age range who watch 2 hours or less of television per
day (9). Furthermore, girls who watched 4 or more hours of
television per day were found to be at risk to have a
statistically significantly higher BMI than children of this
age range who watched 2 to 3 hours of television per day.
Our results, that the children in our study watched a mean of
1 hour or less of television per day, agree with the existing
literature, in which no studies to date have found a relation-
ship between television viewing and overweight in children
who watch 2 hours or less of television per day. In addition,
the total combined inactivity of the children in this study,
including both television viewing and time spent in other
inactive pursuits, was 2 hours per day. Thus, although the
time that the children in this study spent being inactive was
distributed differently among the possible means of inactiv-
ity than among children in the United States, obesity does
not seem to be associated with 2 hours or less per day of
inactivity in any of the countries that have been studied so
far (5,11).
In-depth studies of the relationship between television
viewing and overweight in children have been conducted
in the United States and Mexico (5,11). Studies that
include television viewing in the analysis of childhood
obesity have also been conducted in Canada and France
(19,20). By studying other countries with different levels
of television viewing and programming availability, we
hope to learn more about the potential role of television
viewing in childhood obesity. Thus, the greatest strength
of this study may lie in the choice of population, because
no other country studied has levels of television viewing
and inactivity as low as China. Additional strengths in-
clude the high quality of the diet data, the availability of
a full set of physical inactivity data, and the large study
population.
Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional
nature of the study, the lack of availability of information
on the content of the television watched, and the fact that
the inactivity data were collected by self-report. The
cross-sectional nature of the study is a major limitation
because it is not possible to demonstrate a cause-and-
effect relationship, as cross-sectional studies have been
less likely to find an association between television view-
ing and obesity than longitudinal studies (21). We have
no validation study for these inactivity measures for
children, but similar measures on adults have produced
important and statistically significant effects on adult
obesity incidence (17,22). Finally, the calorie excess/
deficit needed to gain/lose weight can be very small.
Self-reported physical activity and, thus, inactivity, mea-
sures may not be sensitive to this amount of variation
(20).
The importance of this study lies in its demonstration of
a lack of association between very low levels of inactivity
and obesity. The results of this study provide grounds for
future studies to identify the threshold of inactivity associ-
ated with an increased risk of obesity. Hopefully, the iden-
tification of this threshold can be used to decrease the threat
of obesity in the world's children.
