Introduction
It has been established that there is a circadian rhythm in
the rate of urinary potassium excretion (UK
V).1­4 Recently,
we have reported that the circadian rhythm of UK
V is asso-
ciated with the urinary sodium excretion rate (UNa
V) in
patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), who are not
treated with antihypertensive agents.5 Meanwhile, we have
postulated that the diminished renal sodium excretion capa-
bility caused sodium retention during the day, and facili-
tated the nocturnal pressure-natriuresis (i.e. non-dipper
circadian blood pressure (BP) rhythm).6­8 In fact, treatment
with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) increased the
UNa
V during the daytime, lowered the sodium balance
compared to the baseline and shifted the circadian BP
rhythm from a non-dipper to a dipper pattern, similarly to
the action of diuretics.9,10 In the present study we evaluated
the change in the circadian rhythm of UK
V during treatment
with anARB in patients with CKD, and determined whether
the circadian rhythm of the UK
V changes in association
with the UNa
V during ARB treatment.

Abstract
Introduction: We have reported that the circadian rhythm of urinary potassium excretion (UK
V) is determined by the
rhythm of urinary sodium excretion (UNa
V) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We also reported that treat-
ment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) increased the UNa
V during the daytime, and restored the non-dipper
blood pressure (BP) rhythm into a dipper pattern. However, the circadian rhythm of UK
V during ARB treatment has not
been reported.
Materials and methods: Circadian rhythms of UNa
V and UK
V were examined in 44 patients with CKD undergoing treat-
ment with ARB.
Results: Whole-day UNa
V was not altered by ARB whereas whole-day UK
V decreased. Even during the ARB treatment,
the significant relationship persisted between the night/day ratios of UNa
V and UK
V (r=0.56, p<0.0001). Whole-day UK
V/
UNa
V ratio (p=0.0007) and trans-tubular potassium concentration gradient (p=0.002) were attenuated but their night/
day ratios remained unchanged. The change in the night/day UK
V ratio correlated directly with the change in night/day
UNa
V ratio (F=20.4) rather than with the changes in aldosterone, BP or creatinine clearance.
Conclusions: The circadian rhythm of UK
V was determined by the rhythm of UNa
V even during ARB treatment. Changes
in the circadian UK
V rhythm were not determined by aldosterone but by UNa
V.

criteria,11 a pre-treatment office BP >130/80 mmHg (or
125/75 mmHg if proteinuria was greater than 1 g/day),
which was the goal of the antihypertensive therapy for
CKD patients recommended by the current guidelines,12­14
and no contra-indications for treatment with ARB.
Exclusion criteria were: (a) diabetic nephropathy, (b)
nephrotic syndrome, (c) receiving antihypertensive agents
or diuretics and (d) change in the dose of glucocorticoids or
immunosuppressive agents within two months because
these could influence the circadian BP rhythm or renal
function. The study was approved by the ethics review
committee of Nagoya City University Graduate School of
Medical Sciences, and was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki, as with our previous report.6­10
Overall, 44 patients with CKD (29 men and 15 women;
aged 17­75 years with a mean age of 43±17 years; body
mass index: 23.1±3.1 kg/m2; body weight: 62.6±11.0 kg)
were enrolled consecutively after providing informed
consent.
Study protocol
The subjects received nutritional instructions to eat a regu-
lar sodium diet containing <8 g/day of salt for at least four
weeks before enrollment. Twenty-four hour ambulatory
BP monitoring (ABPM) and urinary sampling were per-
formed on the last day of a seven-day hospitalization
period, during which subject diets included 7.0 and 1.3­
2.0 g/day of sodium chloride and potassium, respectively.
The diet provided 30­50 g protein per day. The subjects
were asked to get up at 6:00 and to start bed-rest at 21:00.
Throughout the study period, no additional medications or
changes in the dosages of concomitant drugs were allowed.
After the baseline examinations, the participants received
single daily doses of an ARB, olmesartan, in the morning.
The dose of olmesartan medoxomil was increased to the
highest possible dose (2.5­40 mg/day) in order to attain
the daytime BP goal <130/80 mmHg or 125/75 mmHg if
proteinuria was greater than 1 g/day.12,13
BP was monitored noninvasively every 30 min using a
validated automatic device (model ES-H531, Terumo,
Tokyo, Japan) with a standard BP cuff (240 mm long and
130 mm wide; Japanese Industrial Standards) on the last
day of a seven-day hospitalization period at the baseline
and eight weeks after treatment with olmesartan. The BP
values were not considered valid for analysis, if data
were missing continuously for 2 h, or if the patients
awoke during the night and had difficulty falling asleep
again. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) was calculated as
diastolic BP plus one-third of the pulse BP. Daytime BP
was calculated as the average of the 30 readings between
6:00­21:00, and the night-time BP was the average of the
remaining 18 readings. The night/day MAP ratio was
obtained as the ratio of the above averages as an indicator
of the circadian BP rhythm. Nocturnal hypertension was
defined as a night-time BP of >120/70 mmHg and the
non-dipper BP rhythm defined as a night/day MAP of
>0.9. Urinary samples were collected for both daytime
(6:00­21:00) and night-time (21:00­6:00) to estimate the
circadian rhythm of urinary excretion rates of sodium
(UNa
V, mmol/hr) and potassium (UK
V, mmol/hr). In par-
ticular, an increase in UK
V/UNa
V ratio is known to reflect
the effect of aldosterone on renal tubular reabsorption of
Na and secretion of K at the primary sites of potassium
secretion.15 The trans-tubular potassium concentration
gradient (TTKG) was calculated as follows:16
TTKG = (UK
/PK
)/(Uosm
/Posm
)
Where, UK
, PK
, Uosm
and Posm
were the urine and serum
potassium concentration, and urine and serum osmolality,
respectively. The collected urine samples were combined
to calculate the 24 h creatinine clearance (CCr
, ml/min),
which was used as a measure of glomerular filtration rate.
The adequacy of 24 h urine collection was judged by the
amount of urinary creatinine excretion: for men aged <50
years, 18.5­25.0; for women aged <50 years, 16.5­22.4;
for men aged 50 years, 15.7­20.2; and for women aged
50 years, 11.8­16.1 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively.
Incomplete or excessive urine collection in either the day-
time or night-time samples were judged on the basis of the
night/day ratio of the urinary creatinine excretion rate <0.5
or >2.0. Blood samples were collected only once at 6:00,
which was the marginal point between the daytime and
night-time. To evaluate plasma renin activity (PRA), and
plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), blood samples
were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C, and were
frozen immediately and stored at ­35°C until assay. PRA
and PAC were then determined using radioimmunoassay at
an external analysis center (SRL, Inc., Hachioji, Japan).
Statistical analysis
The results are expressed as the mean±standard deviation
(SD). Data distribution was tested using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test, and variables that were not normally dis-
tributed were analyzed after log-transformation. The
differences in parameters between baseline and ARB
treatment were examined using the Student's t-test for
paired samples. Correlations among variables were
evaluated by the least-squares method. Relationships
between the changes in the variables were analyzed by
linear regression through the origin. Stepwise forward
multiple regression analysis was also applied to identify
the factors that contributed independently to the decreases
in night/day UK
V ratio by ARB. p-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

stages 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, according to the Kidney Disease
Outcomes Quality Initiative criteria, were 24, 7, 6, 5, and 2,
respectively. Whole-day UNa
V and UK
V were 108±46 and
32±12 mmol/day, respectively. Night/day ratios of UNa
V
and UK
V were 1.05±0.62 and 0.85±0.38, respectively.
Interestingly, 23 out of 44 patients (48%) had night/day
UNa
V ratios >1.0, whereas 12 patients (27%) had night/day
UK
V ratio of >1.0. Consistent with our previous report,5 the
night/day UK
V ratio exhibited an inverse relationship with
CCr
(r=-0.33, p=0.03), and correlated directly with night/
day UNa
V ratio (r=0.58, p<0.0001, Figure 1). Whole day
UK
V/UNa
V correlated directly with whole day TTKG
(r=0.73, p<0.0001).
Effects of ARB
As shown in Table 1, the ARB decreased the night/day
ratios of SBP, DBP, MAP, UNa
V and UK
V. During the treat-
ment with ARB, 20 subjects (45%) exhibited the non-dip-
per BP rhythm. Specifically, among 32 patients whose
circadian BP rhythm was non-dipper at baseline, the BP
rhythm restored into dipper pattern in 14 patients but
remained non-dipper in 18 patients. On the other hand,
among 12 patients whose circadian BP rhythm was dipper
at baseline, 10 patients remained dippers and two patients
turned into non-dippers. Whole-day UNa
V was not altered
by ARB, reflecting the constant amount of sodium
intake. On the other hand, whole-day values of UK
V were
decreased. ARB significantly decreased both daytime and
night-time UK
V and increased daytime UNa
V but night-time
UNa
V was unchanged. Consequently, ARB decreased the
night/day ratios of UNa
V (1.05±0.62 to 0.80±0.42, p=0.002)
and UK
V (0.85±0.38 to 0.69±0.26, p=0.0002). Whole day,
daytime and night-time values of urine volume (V, ml/h)
were not altered by ARB (p=0.3, 0.8 and 0.1, respectively).
The night/day ratio of urine volume was also significantly
reduced (p=0.05): the ratio correlated directly with that of
UK
V at baseline (r=0.44, p=0.003), but it did not correlate
with night/day UK
V ratio during theARB treatment (r=0.29,
p=0.05). Whole day, and daytime values of urinary osmolar
excretion rate (Uosm
V, mOsm/h) were not altered by ARB
(p=0.3, and 0.5, respectively), whereas night-time Uosm
V
significantly decreased (p=0.002). Even during the ARB
treatment, the significant relationship persisted between the
night/day ratios of UNa
V and UK
V (r=0.56, p<0.0001,
Figure 1). Whole-day, daytime and night-time values of
both UK
V/UNa
V and TTKG were all attenuated by ARB
treatment. Even during the ARB treatment, whole day
UK
V/UNa
V correlated directly with whole day TTKG
(r=0.79, p<0.0001). Night/day ratios of both UK
V/UNa
V
and TTKG were unchanged. Multiple regression analysis
(R2=0.35, p<0.0001) identified that the change in the night/
day ratio of UK
V was determined by the change in night/
day UNa
V ratio (F=21.3), rather than the changes in
aldosterone (F=0.5), CCr
(F=0.9), TTKG (F=1.2), UK
V/
UNa
V ratio (F=0.4), or the night/day MAP ratio (F=1.3).
Discussion
The present study demonstrated that the circadian rhythm
of UK
V was associated with the rhythm of UNa
V before and
during the treatment with ARB. ARB decreased the UK
V/
UNa
V and TTKG, indicating that the ARB could diminish
the effect of aldosterone on renal tubular reabsorption of
Na+ and secretion of K+ at the primary sites of potassium
secretion. However, the change in the night/day ratio of
UK
V was determined by the change in night/day UNa
V
ratio, rather than the changes in aldosterone, CCr
, TTKG,
UK
V/UNa
V ratio, or the night/day MAP ratio.
Potassium is excreted into urine primarily through
secretion from tubular cells rather than filtration across the
glomerular capillary wall because almost all of the filtered
potassium is reabsorbed passively by the proximal tubule
and loop of Henle: and potassium is secreted into urine
from the principal cells of the cortical collecting tubules
and from the cells in the adjacent connecting segment or
outer medullary collecting tubules.17 Under physiologic
conditions, tubular potassium secretion is mediated by
aldosterone, the plasma potassium concentration, the distal
flow rate and the transepithelial potential difference: in the
presence of aldosterone, tubular potassium secretion is
enhanced as the delivery of sodium to the distal nephrons
is augmented.18­22 On the basis of these findings, we

examined the UK
V/UNa
V ratio. The ratio cannot strictly
represent the relationship between distal flow and potassium
secretion but an increase can roughly indicate the effect of
aldosterone on renal tubular potassium secretion. The pre-
sent study demonstrated that 24 h values of the UK
V/UNa
V
ratio and TTKG were attenuated, indicating that the ARB
also reduced the sodium reabsorption via epithelial sodium
channels (ENaCs). In fact, ARBs are known to diminish
the secretion of adrenal aldosterone, and to decrease the
number23 and activity24 of ENaCs, independent of circulat-
ing aldosterone. Interestingly, during the ARB treatment,
the night/day ratio of TTKG and UK
V/UNa
V were both
unchanged and the change in the circadian UK
V rhythm
was not attributed to the change in UK
V/UNa
V ratio or
TTKG, but was determined by the change in the circadian
UNa
V rhythm.
The present study has some limitations. It was reported
that aldosterone can contribute to UK
V only under the con-
dition of supraphysiologic levels due to hyperkalemia.25 In
addition, recently, it was reported that dietary potassium
intake was sensed in the gut, and an unidentified gut factor
is activated to stimulate renal potassium.26 Dietary potas-
sium was constant and relatively low in this study proto-
col. Potassium can also be secreted into feces (5­10 mmol/
day) and sweat (0­10 mmol/day). As renal function dete-
riorates, aldosterone secretion is stimulated independent of
angiotensin,27 resulting in enhanced potassium excretion
into feces.28 Therefore, we could not confirm the amount
of potassium intake or total body potassium balance, based
solely on the 24 h UK
V. During the data collection period,
the amount of dietary sodium, potassium and protein were
constant for individual subject. However, because we
measured data only at the single point, potential day-to-
day variability of BP or urinary electrolytes excretion
could not be considered.
In conclusion, the present study is the first to report that
in patients with CKD, changes in the circadian rhythm of
UK
V during ARB treatment were based on the change in
circadian UNa
V rhythm, rather than the changes in aldoster-
one, CCr
, TTKG, UK
V/UNa
V ratio or circadian BP rhythm.
