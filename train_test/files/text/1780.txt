ABSTRACT
MARK, A. E., and I. JANSSEN. Dose­Response Relation between Physical Activity and Blood Pressure in Youth. Med. Sci. Sports
Exerc., Vol. 40, No. 6, pp. 1007­1012, 2008. The dose­response relationship between physical activity (PA) and cardiovascular health
in children and adolescents is unclear. Blood pressure (BP) is a practical and useful measure of cardiovascular health in youth. Purpose:
This study aims to examine the dose­response relationship between objectively measured PA and BP in children and adolescents.
Methods: The sample included 1170 youth aged 8­17 yr from the 2003/04 U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PA was measured using Actigraph accelerometers (Ft. Walton Beach, FL, USA) over 7 d. Thresholds of 2000 and 3000 counts per
minute were used to denote those minutes where the participants were engaged in total PA and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA,
respectively. BP was measured using standard procedures. Systolic and diastolic BP values were adjusted for age, height, and sex.
Participants with adjusted BP values Q90th percentile were considered to have hypertension. Thirty-six fractional polynomial regression
models were used to obtain the dose­response curve that best fit the relation between PA with systolic BP, diastolic BP, and
hypertension. Results: Inverse dose­response relations were observed between total and moderate-to-vigorous PA with systolic and
diastolic BP. The slopes of the curves were modest indicating a minimal influence of PA on mean BP values. The likelihood of having
hypertension decreased in a curvilinear manner with increasing minutes of PA. At 30 and 60 minIdj1 of moderate-to-vigorous PA, the
odd ratios (95% confidence intervals) for hypertension were 0.50 (0.28­0.64) and 0.38 (0.17­0.52), respectively, in comparison to no
PA. Conclusions: A modest dose­response relation was observed between PA and mean systolic and diastolic BP values. PA did,
however, have a strong gradient effect on BP when predicting hypertensive values. These results support the public health
recommendation that children and youth accumulate at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA daily. Key Words:

Cardiovascular disease is a progressive disease that
starts in childhood (28­31). Elevated blood pressure
(BP) during childhood and adolescence increases
the risk of hypertension in adulthood (3,25), when more
severe forms of cardiovascular disease also occur quite
frequently. It is therefore important to prevent the develop-
ment of hypertension at young ages.
Physical activity (PA) is key component of the therapeu-
tic lifestyle changes recommended for preventing and
treating prehypertension and hypertension in children and
youth (21,33). The American Heart Association recom-
mends that children and youth participate in at least 60 min
of moderate-to-vigorous PA daily for cardiovascular health
promotion (16). The review of PA interventions completed
during the development of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention­sponsored 2005 evidence-based PA guide-
lines for children and youth suggests that at least 30 min of
PA at a frequency of 3 times per week and intensity of 80%
of maximal heart rate is required to lower BP (24).
Although it is recognized that PA has important effects on
BP, the specific PA guidelines and recommendations
mentioned above were developed based on the best
available evidence, which in the case for BP and most
other health outcomes in children and youth, is not the ideal
type and amount of evidence (14).
Dose­response studies are particularly useful for deter-
mining the minimal and optimal amount of PA required for
good health. To our knowledge, only two studies (11,23)
have examined the dose­response relation between PA and
BP in children and adolescent with only one study finding a
relation (11). This study found that for every 100 METIh
increase in PA, systolic BP decreased in a linear manner by
1.15 mm Hg (11). Although a dose­response relation was
seen, the PA measurement unit (MET) does not provide
information that can be transformed into an understand-
able public health message (e.g., minutes of PA per day).
The self-reported PA questionnaire used in that study was
also subject to recall bias (12), and likely resulted in an
overestimation of actual PA levels. Objective measures of

PA, such as those obtained by accelerometers, offer the
advantage of being able to measure the frequency, intensity,
and duration of activity.
Although PA may play an important role in the
prevention of hypertension, the dose­response relation
between PA and BP in the pediatric age group is unclear.
Therefore, the purpose of the study was to examine the
dose­response relation between objectively measured PA,
BP, and hypertension in children and youth.
METHODS
The study sample consisted of participants from the
2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES). NHANES is a representative cross-
sectional survey of the U.S. population (7). The secondary
analysis presented here was approved by the Queen`s
University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board.
NHANES participants were identified using a complex,
stratified, multistage, probability sampling design (7). The
present study was limited to those aged 8 to 17 yr who
completed both the home and mobile exam center (MEC)
components of the survey required for the analysis.
Informed consent was obtained from all the parents and
participants, and the protocol was approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics.
Physical activity. PA was measured using Actigraph
7124 activity monitors (Actigraph, Ft. Walton Beach, FL,
USA). Activity monitors can be used to objectively measure
the duration and intensity of PA under free-living
conditions (27,32). Monitors were provided to subjects
during the MEC exam, were programmed to start recording
at midnight of the day following the exam, and recorded
activity for the following 7 d. Participants were instructed to
wear the monitor during waking hours except when it
would get wet. Monitors were attached to elasticized fabric
belts and worn on the right hip.
The Actigraph is a uniaxial monitor that measures the
intensity of movement averaged over 1-min sampling
epochs. Data from each monitor were downloaded by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and checked for
spurious data (e.g., biologically implausible values), which
were subsequently removed. We did not remove additional
spurious data; however, further data reduction was com-
pleted by the authors before analyses were performed.
Specifically, the current study only included subjects with
at least 4 d of complete monitoring, including at least one
weekend day. Four days of monitoring has a test­retest
reliability of 0.7 (27). A day was considered complete if it
included at least 10 h of wear time (27). Wear time was
determined by filtering activity monitor data and deleting
sections of more than 20 min of zero counts indicating
nonwear time (20).
For each complete day of monitoring, thresholds of 2000
(equivalent to walking ~4.0 kmIhj1) and 3000 (equivalent
to walking ~5.6 kmIhj1) counts per minute were used to
denote those minutes where the participants were engaged
in PA of at least a low intensity (total PA) and moderate-to-
vigorous intensity PA, respectively (26). The measurement
unit of counts per minute is generated based on the
magnitude and frequency of movement. The minutes of
total and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA were averaged
across all complete days of monitoring to create the final
PA variables used for analysis.
There is considerable discrepancy in the literature
concerning the accelerometry threshold that should be used
to classify PA intensity, and the proposed thresholds often
vary by age and gender (13). The 2000 and 3000 counts per
minute thresholds used in this study were selected based on
available evidence and best judgement of the authors.
Although the thresholds used here were developed from a
study conducted entirely in adolescent females, similar
thresholds have been used for males and females (1,22) and
in youth ranging in age from 6 to 16 yr (22). Thresholds
were based on METs achieved during regular child/youth
activities (e.g., threshold for moderate-to-vigorous PA
based on counts per minute for activity of 3 METs).
Blood pressure. Measurements were completed at the
MEC. Subjects were seated and rested quietly for 5 min
before 3 BP measures were obtained on the right arm using
a mercury sphygmomanometer. Systolic BP was recorded at
the first Korotkoff sound, and diastolic BP was the point of
the last audible Korotkoff sound. Mean BP values were
used for all analyses. BP z-scores were calculated based on
reference values for age, height, and sex (21). Hypertension
was defined as having systolic or diastolic levels above the
90th percentile for age, sex, and height (considered
prehypertensive or hypertensive) (21).
Body mass index. Height and weight were measured
during the MEC to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 kg,
respectively, and used to calculate the body mass index
(kgImj2). Subjects were classified as ``at-risk of overweight''
and ``overweight'' according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention age- and gender-specific cut-points
for children and youth of 85th­94th percentiles and Q95th
percentile, respectively (19).
Statistical analysis. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA)
and took into account the sample weights of the NHANES
survey. Linear regression was used to examine the
relationship between total PA and moderate-to-vigorous
PA with systolic BP and diastolic BP. Logistic regression
was used to examine the relationship between total PA and
moderate-to-vigorous PA with hypertension. In all
statistical models, PA was included as a continuous
measure in minutes per day. Fractional polynomial models
for PA were run to obtain the models that best fit the dose­
response relation between PA, BP, and hypertension. The
36 fractional polynomial regression models recommended
by Bagnardi et al. (2) for examining dose­response
relations were used for the current analysis. This form of
analysis is concerned with finding the dose­response curve

with the best model fit rather than determining the
significance of the linear relation between the exposure
(PA) and outcome (mean BP value or hypertension). For
the linear regression analyses, the model with the highest R2
and smallest error was considered to provide the best fit.
For the logistic regression analyses, the model with the
lowest Akaike information criterion was considered to
provide the best fit. Sex, age, and race-ethnicity (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other)
were included as covariates in all statistical models.
Bootstrapping was used to estimate the 95% confidence
intervals (CI) for the regression analyses.
RESULTS
There were 2413 participants aged 8 to 17 yr in the 2003/
2004 NHANES. Acceptable PA measurements were not
available for 1197 participants, and acceptable BP measure-
ments were not available for 166 participants. The current
analyses included the 1170 participants (607 males and 563
females) with complete PA and BP measurements. There
were no statistical differences in the body mass index or
gender distribution in the participants who were included or
excluded from the analyses. However, the participants
included in the analyses were younger and contained a
higher proportion of Hispanics.
Basic demographic characteristics of the subjects
included in the analyses are presented in Table 1.
Approximately one quarter of the study participants were
non-Hispanic white, and 38.4% were classified as either at-
risk of overweight or overweight. Subjects participated in
53.0 T 32.1 minIdj1 (mean T SD) and 25.8 T 20.6 minIdj1
of total PA and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA, respec-
tively. Mean systolic and diastolic BP values in males were
108.5 T 10.4 and 57.0 T 11.3 mm Hg, respectively. The
corresponding values in females were 104.1 T 8.9 and 58.5
T 10.6 mm Hg. Approximately 14% of the participants were
hypertensive (18.1% in males, 9.4% in females). As shown
in Table 2, a higher proportion of females participated in
less than 30 minIdj1 of total PA compared to males (36.9%
vs 14.8%). Most males (88.3%) and females (98.6%)
participated in less than 60 minIdj1 of moderate-to-
vigorous intensity PA.
Relations between PA and BP were modeled for PA
values ranging from 0 minIdj1 to 2 standard deviations
above the population mean. An inverse dose­response
relationship was observed between total (Fig. 1A) and
moderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 1B) with systolic BP. Total
PA had no effect on systolic BP until approximately 40
minIdj1, after which systolic BP decreased as total PA
increased, with no plateau in the effect. Although an inverse
relation was observed between total PA, moderate-to-
vigorous PA, and systolic BP, the slope of the curve was
modest, indicating a minimal influence of PA on systolic
BP measures. For example, the systolic BP z-score
decreased by 0.09 units between 60 and 90 minIdj1 of
total PA, which is equivalent to 0.93 mm Hg. A similar
modest dose­response relation was seen between total PA
(Fig. 1C) and moderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 1D) with
diastolic BP. A plateau in the effect of PA on diastolic BP
was seen at approximately 75 and 40 minIdj1 for total and
moderate-to-vigorous PA, respectively.
The likelihood of hypertension decreased in a curvilinear
manner with increasing minutes of total PA (Fig. 2A) and
moderate-to-vigorous PA (Fig. 2B). At 30 minIdj1 of
moderate-to-vigorous PA, the odd ratio (95% CI) for
hypertension was 0.50 (0.28­0.64) in comparison to no
PA. At 60 minIdj1 of moderate-to-vigorous PA, the odds
ratio (95% CI) for hypertension was 0.38 (0.17­0.52). At
30, 60, 90, and 120 minIdj1 of total PA, the odds ratios
(95% CI) for hypertension relative to no activity were 0.80
(0.36­0.97), 0.64 (0.32­0.69), 0.51 (0.22­0.58), and 0.40
(0.14­0.55), respectively.
DISCUSSION
This study focused on developing dose­response curves
that best represent the relation between PA, BP, and
hypertension in children and youth. A modest dose­
response relation was observed between total and moderate-
to-vigorous PA with mean systolic and diastolic BP values.
PA did, however, have a strong effect on BP when predicting
high-risk values in the hypertensive range. At 60 minIdj1
of moderate-to-vigorous PA, the PA volume corresponding
to the public health recommendation in many countries
(4,9,24), the likelihood of hypertension was approximately
one third of that observed for no moderate-to-vigorous PA.
The modest nature of the dose­response relation between
PA and BP was not unexpected considering the discrepancy

in the literature surrounding the effects of PA on BP in
children and youth. In a previous study of adolescents with
dyslipidemia, a linear dose­response relation was found
between self-report PA and systolic BP; PA was not related
to diastolic BP (11). That study did not consider whether
the relation between PA and BP was nonlinear in nature. Of
the two studies in children and youth that examined the
relation between PA and BP using an objective measure of
PA (e.g., accelerometers) (1,5), only one (1) reported a
significant correlation. Neither of these studies used an
analysis strategy that adequately explored the dose­
response relation between PA and BP (1,5).
A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials
reported a similar inconsistency in the effects of PA
interventions on lowering BP in children and adolescents
(18). The authors suggested that the null effect of PA on BP
may have been in part related to the inclusion of
normotensive subjects in the intervention trials (18). Of
the 16 groups included in the meta-analysis, only two were
limited to hypertensive subjects (18). A similar observation
was made by the authors of an adult based meta-analysis on
PA and BP. The adult meta-analysis found PA to have a
threefold greater effect on lowering BP in hypertensive
compared to normotensive individuals (10). The findings
from these meta-analyses suggest that PA has a greater
effect on high-risk BP values. Our results support this
contention. The slopes of the dose­response curves between
PA and mean BP values were modest, whereas the slope
of the dose­response curves between PA and hypertension
were quite steep. That PA has a greater effect on high-risk
BP values is consistent with the effects of PA on other
cardiovascular risk factors including blood lipids/lipoproteins
(17) and insulin resistance (15). Perhaps it is only intuitive
that PA does not positively impact cardiovascular risk factor
values that already fall within the normal healthy range.
In studies of adults, it has been reported that the
intensity of PA does not significantly contribute to
whether or not a PA intervention is able to successfully
reduce BP levels (10). Conversely, the 2005 evidence-
based PA guidelines for children and youth suggest that an
intensity corresponding to 80% of the maximum heart rate
is required in a PA intervention to reduce BP levels in
hypertensive children and adolescents (24). In the current
study, the nature of the dose­response curve between PA
and hypertension was similar for both total and moderate-
to-vigorous intensity PA. However, considerably fewer
minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA were required
to lower hypertension risk. For instance, the likelihood of
hypertension was reduced by approximately 50% at 30
minIdj1 of moderate-to-vigorous PA versus 90 minIdj1 of
total PA. Thus, in the development of strategies aimed at
preventing and treating hypertension in children and youth,
both time and intensity of PA are important factors to
consider.

Our results provide support for the 2005 evidence-based
PA guidelines (24), which recommend that school-aged
children and youth accumulate at least 60 min of moderate-
to-vigorous intensity PA daily. Specifically, we observed a
plateau in the relationship between moderate-to-vigorous
PA and hypertension risk at approximately 60 minIdj1. The
absence of a plateau in the relationship between total PA
and hypertension risk also corroborates the Canadian PA
guidelines for children and youth, which recommends that
all children and youth, regardless of their current PA level,
increase overall PA by 90 minIdj1 (http://www.phac-aspc.
gc.ca/pau-uap/fitness/downloads.html). Given the volume
of PA recommended in the evidence-based PA guidelines,
and the dose­response relation between PA and hyper-
tension observed here, it is very concerning that only
11.7% of the male and 1.4% of the female participants in
this study were moderately or vigorously active for at least
60 minIdj1 on average. These findings emphasize the need
for the implementation of public health interventions and
policies that will substantially improve the PA levels of
most children and adolescents. In the development of
strategies to increase PA participation, it is important to
consider the roles of the family, school, and community
environments have on PA participation in children and
youth (6,8).
The strengths of this study include the use of a large and
representative study sample, the use of an objective PA
measure, and the statistical modeling approach that allowed
us to accurately characterize the dose­response relation
between PA, BP, and hypertension. The primary study
limitation was the cross-sectional and observational nature,
which prevents us from making causal inferences about the
relation between PA and BP. Although objective in nature,
PA accelerometers are not perfect measures of PA, and their
main limitation is the inability to capture certain types of
PA such as swimming and bicycling (12). Another issue
with accelerometers is the discrepancy in thresholds used by
different investigators to denote those minutes where the
participants were physically active, as discussed in more
detail in the Methods. Had different threshold been employed
in the present study, the slopes of the dose­response curves
may have changed. In addition, we considered all minutes of
PA, not just those minutes that occurred within bouts of at
least a few minutes in length. Had we limited the physically
active minutes to those that occurred in bouts, the total
minutes of PA in the study participants would have been
reduced substantially, and the reduction in BP values or
hypertension risk for a given increase in PA would have
been larger. Finally, the slight differences in characteristics
between the participants used in our analyses and the overall
NHANES sample limit the generalizability of the results.
In summary, PA is a better predictor of hypertension than
mean BP levels. Meeting the guidelines of 60 minIdj1 of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA greatly reduces the like-
lihood of hypertension in the pediatric population. Unfortu-
nately, few children and youth achieve this PA level.
