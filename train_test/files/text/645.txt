Using the 1992 and 1994 Waves of the Health and Retirement Survey, we compare individuals
who first take Social Security benefits at age 62 with those who don't and find that the income
and net assets of these two groups are similar in the years just prior to eligibility. However,
there is great diversity within the groups, so that poor health appears to be more closely
related to lower economic well-being than is early Social Security acceptance status. Our
results suggest that raising the Social Security retirement age is not likely to dramatically lower
the economic well-being of the typical person aged 62 since only 3% of men aged 62 are
receiving Social Security retirement benefits, are in poor health, and have Social Security
retirement benefits as their only source of pension income.

Who Takes Early Social Security Benefits?
The Economic and Health Characteristics
of Early Beneficiaries1

While current Social Security taxes exceed pro-
gram expenditures, the retirement of the baby boom
generation in the next century is projected to reverse
this by the year 2013 and to completely exhaust the
Social Security trust funds by 2030 (see Appendix,
Note 1). This looming fiscal crisis has already resulted
in calls for major revisions in Social Security tax and
benefit rules.
Proposals to bring the Social Security system into
long-term balance require either raising revenues --
increases in the Social Security tax rate or in the
maximum taxable Social Security covered earnings
amount -- or reducing expenditures -- reductions in
yearly Social Security benefits or increases in the
Social Security retirement age (see Appendix, Note
2). The last crisis with respect to the solvency of the
Social Security trust fund led in 1983 to a series of
Social Security reforms. These reforms raised Social
Security taxes and put in place a slow increase in the
normal retirement age for standard Social Security
benefits from age 65 to age 67 that will begin in 2003
and be fully phased in by 2026. However, no in-

creases in the earliest age for Social Security retire-
ment benefits were made at that time. Unlike the last
round of changes, during which raising the early
retirement age was never seriously considered, pro-
posals to raise the early retirement age from age 62 to
age 65 are now being evaluated as one component
within alternative packages designed to put the So-
cial Security System into long-term balance (see, for
example, Mitchell & Quinn, 1995).
There are strong arguments for raising the age of
earliest eligibility for Social Security retirement bene-
fits. The life expectancy of the average American has
improved substantially since the inception of Social
Security, as has health at any given age (see Appen-
dix, Note 3). Hence, it is argued that Americans could
work longer to pay for their longer and healthier
retirement years. Prior to 1961 (the year men first
became eligible to receive Social Security benefits at
age 62), the labor force participation rates of men
around age 62 were similar. As can be seen in Table 1,
the labor force participation rate of men age 61 was
79.4% in 1960. For men age 63 it was 75.7% in 1960. By
1986, these rates were 66.2% and 44.3%, respectively,
with the greatest drop for men age 63 coming in the
1970s. Since about the mid-1980s, the labor force
participation rates of men these ages have been
approximately constant. While many factors besides
changes in the Social Security retirement age are
responsible for the dramatic drop in the labor force
participation rate of men aged 62 to 70 over the past
three decades, these major decreases are more con-
sistent with economic factors such as increased
wealth, richer employers, and Social Security pen-
sion plans than with worsening health. (See Quinn,

ture on the influence of health and economic varia-
bles on retirement.)
Based on these premises, it is argued that raising
the earliest age of eligibility for Social Security retire-
ment benefits might be the least burdensome way of
closing the projected Social Security deficit. But it is
always good advice to "beware of the mean" in
evaluating the economic well-being of older Ameri-
cans (see Appendix, Note 4). Hence, it could be
argued that while average health, economic wealth,
and employer pension eligibility are rising, a signifi-
cant number of people who first take Social Security
benefits while they are age 62 are in poor health,
have little economic wealth, no employer pension,
and have not recently worked. Furthermore, it could
be argued that it is this vulnerable group of older
persons who would be most adversely affected by
increasing the earliest age of eligibility for Social
Security benefits.
This article uses Wave 1 and the early release
version of Wave 2 of the Health and Retirement
Survey (HRS) to focus on men and women aged 62 in
1993 and 1994. We take advantage of the longitudinal
nature of the income and net asset data to measure
the economic well-being of individuals in the years
just before and just after they are first able to take
early Social Security benefits. We compare those
who take Social Security retirement or spousal bene-
fits while they are age 62 with those who do not and
find that the economic well-being of these two
groups in the years just before they reach early retire-
ment eligibility age is much closer than is implied by
simply looking at their income after they become
eligible at age 62. But we also find that there is great
diversity within the two populations. When we look
across health, employer pension status, and Social
Security acceptance status, we find health is a better
gauge of economic well-being than is taking early
Social Security benefits. Furthermore, we find that
the great majority of men who take Social Security
retirement benefits while they are age 62 enjoy good
health. In addition, 2 of every 3 men who take early
benefits live in households which already are receiv-
ing employer pension benefits. Less than 10% of the
men who take Social Security benefits while they are
age 62 are both in poor health and dependent on
Social Security as their only source of pension in-
come. Our results are similar for female early Social
Security recipients.
Multi-Period Characteristics of Early Social Security
Takers and Postponers
The Health and Retirement Survey began in 1992
with a random sample of respondents aged 51 to 61
and their families. A reinterview of these respon-
dents was fielded in 1994, and a new wave of inter-
views will occur every two years for the next decade.
While there were 11,539 respondents and spouses in
the first wave, we will only be able to make use of a
portion of the sample, since we want to capture
transitions onto the Social Security retirement rolls
while a person is age 62. This requires us to focus
solely on individuals ages 60 and 61 in 1992, the time
of the first wave of interviews, since they constitute
the population of people who gained eligibility by
the time the second wave of the HRS was collected in
1994 (see Appendix, Note 5). Over time, as more
respondents reach age 62, the number of individuals
in the HRS who face the decision of whether or not to
take Social Security benefits while they are age 62 will
grow. We are currently able to capture 1,235 men and
women who reached age 62 in 1993 or 1994 (see
Appendix, Note 6). A brief description of our sample
and how each variable was constructed can be found
in Table 2. We exclude from our sample anyone who
received Social Security benefits prior to age 62 (see
Appendix, Note 7).
In Table 3 we look at the employment, health, and
economic well-being of this population of men and
women in two years: in 1992, when they were on the
verge of age eligibility for early Social Security bene-
fits and again in 1994, after they had reached age 62.
Column 1 of Table 3 shows that in 1992 when our 580
age-eligible men were ages 60 and 61, 72% were
employed. This approximates the male labor force
participation rate of 60- and 61-year-old men shown
in Table 1 for the year 1992 (see Appendix, Note 8). In
1994, when they were ages 62 and 63, their labor
force participation was only 53%. Much like the 1992
figures, the 1994 labor force participation statistics
are similar to those responses in Table 1 for the year
1994. Not surprisingly, as columns 2 and 3 also show,
by 1994 those men who first took Social Security
benefits at age 62 are also much less likely to be
employed than those who postponed Social Security
acceptance past age 62. Only 22% of early Social
Security takers were employed in 1994, while 66% of
postponers were employed in 1994.

In order to assign taker/postponer status, we construct two variables that identify the year of
Social Security benefit receipt (if any) and the respondent's age in 1993 and 1994. If the
respondent is 62 in 1993 (1994) and reports accepting early Social Security benefits in 1993
(1994), the respondent's status is set to "taker." Respondents who accept benefits in a year
prior to the year they are 62 are dropped from our sample. Respondents are otherwise
classified as "postponers."
Surprisingly, the differences in employment be-
tween male Social Security takers and postponers in
1994 does not appear to be driven by differences in
the prevalence of health limitations in the two popu-
lations. Using our measure of poor health -- whether
a person has a limit on the type or amount of work
performed -- we show that the men in our sample
who took Social Security retirement benefits at age
62 report work limitations in 1992 when they are
either age 60 or 61 at the same rate --16% -- as men
who postponed Social Security benefits past age 62
(see Appendix, Note 9). When their health was again
measured in 1994, although the prevalence of health
limitations increased during the period for both
groups of men, these proportions remain roughly
equivalent between the two groups (20% vs 21%).
While this should not be taken as evidence that
health is unimportant in the decision to take early
Social Security benefits, it does call into question
popular conceptions of early Social Security benefi-
ciaries as having a markedly higher prevalence of
health problems relative to those who delay accept-
ance past age 62.
Although, on average, men who take Social Secu-
rity benefits when they are age 62 are similar to men
who do not, they differ in some important dimen-
sions. For example, the median early Social Security
taker had a somewhat lower household income in
1991, when he was age 59 or 60, than the median
Social Security postponer. By the second wave of the
HRS, this difference in median household income is
much greater -- $4,890 in 1991 versus $13,832 in 1993
(the difference between columns 2 and 3 in Table 3).
However, median income is not the best measure
of economic well-being at ages near retirement. This
is because those who could have worked but chose
to retire are willing to trade labor income for more
leisure time. Hence, simple comparisons of income
at or around age 62 are likely to overstate the gap in
economic well-being between those who take early
Social Security benefits and those who do not. A
better measure is net assets. When we use this mea-
sure, early Social Security takers actually have
slightly greater median net assets than postponers in
1992 (see Appendix, Note 10). In 1994, the median net
assets of takers remains greater than that of post-
poners, although the median increase in net assets
for takers ($1,500) is smaller than for postponers
($5,400). This is not surprising given the greater labor
force participation of postponers in 1994.

One source of wealth not included in our net
assets measure is the asset value of an employer
pension. In 1992, 65% of takers were eligible to
receive them. Among postponers, 57% were eligible
to receive an employer pension in 1992. Hence, it
appears that takers are at least as likely as postponers
to have pension wealth (see Appendix, Note 11).
Not surprisingly, most men who take early Social
Security benefits have also begun taking their em-
ployer pension benefits, if they are eligible to do so.
In 1994,64% of all takers were receiving income from
an employer pension. In contrast, many men who do
not take early Social Security benefits at age 62 also
did not take their employer pension even though
they were eligible to do so -- only 25% of postponers
reported pension income in 1994 (see Appendix,
note 12).
While the median early Social Security taker may
be approximately as well off as the median post-
poner, greater poverty rates for early takers are still
possible. We find that while the poverty rates of
takers and postponers are approximately the same in
1991, poverty rates of both groups increase by 1993,
and the poverty rate of takers is higher --12% vs 9%
-- than postponers.
In the years prior to acceptance, men who take
early Social Security retirement benefits are very simi-
lar to men who do not in terms of health, income, and
net assets, even though they are more likely to be
receiving an employer pension (35% vs 16%) and to
792 The Gerontologist
be out of work (44% vs 22%). This preliminary evi-
dence suggests that on average the pull of benefits
may be at least as important for men as the push of
poor health in their decision to take Social Security
retirement benefits while they are age 62.
In the last three columns of Table 3 we look at the
experience of women in the sample. We disaggregate
the sample by gender because men and women in
this age cohort are likely to have very different earn-
ing histories. The great majority of these men and
women are married, and men of this generation are
much more likely to have been the primary market
earner in a married household. Hence, the transition
of men onto the Social Security retirement rolls is
likely to have a greater impact on household eco-
nomic well-being than the transition of women onto
the rolls. As can be seen in columns 5 and 6, this is the
case. On average, female early Social Security takers
are less likely to be employed than postponers in
either 1992 or 1994. Like men, the median household
income of female early Social Security takers is less
than the median household income of female post-
poners, especially in 1993. But unlike men, the net
assets of the median female taker are substantially
greater than the median household net assets of the
median female postponer both in 1992 and 1994.
Conversely, female takers are slightly less likely to be
eligible to receive employer pension income. In addi-
tion, female takers are less likely to be in poverty in
1993 than female postponers. While female early So-
cial Security takers and postponers are far less likely
to be receiving their own employer pension than
men, over one half of the households of females who
take early Social Security benefits received employer
pension income in 1994, while only about 4 in 10
female postponers received such household pension
income (see Appendix, Note 13). These stylized facts
suggest that if there is a difference in economic well-
being between female takers and postponers, female
takers on average have greater economic well-being
than female postponers.
Because the labor market experiences of men and
women in the age cohort we are examining are very
different, we will continue to disaggregate by gen-
der. But we will also subdivide our sample by two
other important variables -- health and employer
pension benefit status. Some of our subpopulations
have rather small sample sizes, and the results
should be considered with caution.
The first group we define as healthy dual pension-
ers -- those who take Social Security retirement or
spouse benefits while they are age 62 and who also
receive employment pension income in 1994, and
who in Wave 2 of the HRS do not report a health
problem that limits the type or amount of work they
can perform in 1994 (see Appendix, Note 14). The
second and much smaller group is non-healthy dual
pensioners. The third group is healthy single pension-
ers-- those 62-year-old healthy Social Security recipi-
ents who do not receive employer pension income in
1994. The fourth group is non-healthy single pension-
ers. The fifth and sixth groups are drawn from those
who, while age-eligible, did not take Social Security
retirement or spousal benefits while they were age 62
-- we refer to these individuals as postponers.
Healthy postponers are those who do not report a
health limit in 1994. Non-healthy postponers are
those who do report a health limit in 1994.
Table 4, which looks at the men in our sample,
shows that the lowest rates of employment in 1992
appear more related to health status than to taker or
postponer status. While 88% of healthy postponers
were employed, only 42% of nonhealthy postponers
were employed. Healthy single pensioners have em-
ployment rates much closer to healthy postponers
than to nonhealthy postponers -- 71%. Dual pen-
sioners were about equally likely to work regardless
of health status.
Poor health also appears to be more closely associ-
ated with lower median household income in 1991,
when these men were not yet age-eligible for Social
Security benefits, than is subsequent taker or post-
poner status. There is a much greater difference in
median household income between healthy and
nonhealthy groups, regardless of whether or not
they took Social Security benefits while they were
age 62, than there is between takers and postponers
who are healthy or who are in poor health. Health
differences also appear to be more closely associated
with poverty differences than differences in taker-
postponer status.
Net assets are the only exception to the general
pattern of the dominance of health status as a corre-
late of poor economic well-being. While the median
healthy taker (single or dual pensioner) and the me-
dian healthy postponer had more net assets than the
median nonhealthy postponer in 1992, the median
nonhealthy dual pensioner had median net assets
second only to healthy single pensioners in 1992.
However, between 1992 and 1994, the median loss in
net assets of nonhealthy dual postponers was $25,050
and hence, by 1994, the median net assets of non-
healthy dual pensioners was below all three healthy
groups in 1994 (see Appendix, Note 15).
By 1994, when they were aged 62 or 63, employ-
ment dropped for all groups, particularly the un-
healthy, but their relative group income positions
remained virtually the same as in 1992. The very small
sample sizes of the nonhealthy groups make any of
the values reported in Table 4 preliminary, but the
general trends are consistent. The economic dispari-
ties between the healthy and nonhealthy are not
related solely to the receipt or nonreceipt of Social
Security while age 62. Much of the observed differ-
ence existed in 1992 before they were old enough to
receive Social Security retirement benefits.
In Table 5 we repeat the analysis for women. The
findings are very similar with respect to the impor-
tance of health. Even though a woman in this age
cohort is not likely to be the dominant earner in a
married couple, her health in 1994 is more closely
associated with the household's income, net assets,
and poverty status both before and after her initial
eligibility than is the fact that she takes or postpones
Social Security benefits while she is age 62.
In Table 6 we once again compare early Social

Security takers and postponers across the six sub-
groups that make up these two populations for men
and women. We show the relative size of each group
in the population, the share of overall income they
command, and their share of overall poverty. We
then use the ratio of the group's share of these
measures of economic well-being to their share of
the total population as a measure of their relative
share of total resources. In the first five columns of
Table 6, we consider the well-being of men. The first
column shows the percentage of our sample that falls
into the six groups we have been considering.
Among men aged 62 in 1993,34.6% took Social Secu-
rity benefits while they were age 62. Among these
early beneficiaries, dual pensioners are more com-
mon than single pensioners, comprising 21.7% of all
men relative to 14% who are single pensioners. But
among the relatively small population who are de-
pendent solely on Social Security benefits, only a
small minority reported being unable to work be-
cause of a health limitation. Hence, only 2.7% of the
male population aged 62 in 1993 took early Social
Security benefits, had no employer pension, and had
a health condition that limited work.
The majority of men in our sample, 65.4%, did not
take early Social Security benefits in 1993 when they
were age 62. Of these postponers the great majority
were healthy in 1994 and comprise 52.1% of all men
in our sample. While nonhealthy postponers are a
relatively small part of the postponer population,
they are nevertheless a surprisingly large part of the
total population of men. Nonhealthy postponers

make up 13.3% of the population of men. A larger
share of nonhealthy men postponed early Social
Security benefits than took them, and they outnum-
ber nonhealthy single pensioners by almost 5 to 1.
Columns two through five in Table 6 show the
share of income and poverty associated with each of
the six groups. In 1993, those taking early Social
Security benefits received 24.3% of all income in our
sample. Relative to their 34.6% share of the popula-
tion, their share of income is disproportionately
small. Their proportional share of income is .70 (24.3
divided by 34.6). They also experienced a higher
than proportional share of group poverty in 1993.
Those who postponed acceptance of Social Secu-
rity, on the other hand, received a larger than pro-
portional share of income and experienced propor-
tionately less poverty.
But as discussed previously, comparisons of eco-
nomic well-being between men who have left the
labor force and begun taking Social Security benefits
and those who postpone benefits exclude the value
of added leisure time. Hence, the economic well-
being of takers relative to those who postpone early
Social Security benefits is likely to be understated. As
can be seen in column 3 of Table 6, the relative
income commanded by takers in 1991, while still
smaller than proportional, is larger than in 1993 (81%
vs 70%) and their share of poverty is also smaller
(1.16% vs 1.22%).

taker status, appears more closely related to the
share of income these groups control. In 1991
healthy postponers controlled the greatest share of
income relative to their size but they were closely
followed by healthy single and dual pensioners and
only distantly by nonhealthy postponers and takers.
In the second half of Table 6 we repeat this exer-
cise for women aged 62 in 1993. The patterns are
similar. The income controlled by early Social Secu-
rity takers and postponers is closer to proportional in
1991 than in 1993, and the importance of health is
once again seen. Healthy dual pension takers and
healthy postponers have almost identically dispro-
portionate shares in 1991, followed by healthy single
pensioners. Nonhealthy postponers and nonhealthy
takers follow the healthy single pensioners. Preva-
lence of poverty shows a similar pattern with respect
to health but is actually greater in 1991 for takers than
in 1993.
But as we have previously discussed, using income
to measure economic well-being even for years just
prior to age 62 is likely to exaggerate the differences
in economic well-being between takers and post-
poners. As was seen in Table 3, a large minority of
men have already left employment and started to
take employer pensions prior to age 62 and such men
are disproportionately early Social Security takers.
Hence, gains in added leisure time for these men will
be disproportionately missed by income measures of
economic well-being.
Table 7 is superior to Table 6 in two important
ways. First, it uses net assets rather than income as its
measure of economic well-being and second, it al-
lows us to substantially increase our sample size.
Because wealth is measured contemporaneously in
the HRS, we are able to include men and women who
were age 62 in 1994 to our sample of men and women
who were age 62 in 1993 from Table 6. The increased
sample size slightly increases the share of the post-
poner population but does not substantially change
the relative shares of those with and without health
conditions and dual pension status across the
groups. Nonhealthy postponers continue to greatly
outnumber nonhealthy takers and especially non-
healthy single pensioners. And dual pensioners con-
tinue to outnumber single pensioners among takers.
As expected, net assets in 1994 are much more
equally distributed than income in 1993 between
takers and postponers. While postponers control a
greater share of net assets than takers, it is only 104%
for men and 101% for women in 1994 compared to
131% and 128% of income in 1993.
Conclusion
The labor force participation rate of men aged 62
through 64 declined dramatically following the intro-
duction of early Social Security benefits for men in
1961, although since the mid-1980s labor force partic-
ipation rates have leveled off. Nonetheless, the great
majority of men take Social Security benefits before
age 65, and around one third take these benefits
while they are age 62. We have used preliminary data
from the Health and Retirement Survey to look at
men and women who reach age 62 in 1993 and 1994 to

see if there are differences in income, health, and net
assets between those who take Social Security bene-
fits while they are age 62 and those who postpone
benefit acceptance past this age.
Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that the
overwhelming majority of male Social Security takers
are in good health, and more than 6 in 10 are already
receiving an employer pension in addition to their
Social Security benefits. Less than 10% of male early
Social Security takers are both in poor health and
have Social Security as their only source of pension
income, and this group makes up less than 3% of the
population of 62-year-old men. Only about two fe-
male early Social Security takers in 10 are both in
poor health and have Social Security as their only
personal source of pension income. The majority of
women who take early Social Security benefits while
they are age 62 are both healthy and live in a house-
hold with employer pension income.
The economic well-being of early Social Security
takers, both men and women, when measured by
household income, is on average lower than the
economic well-being of postponers, but because
takers work less than postponers and the value of
leisure is ignored in such an income measure, this
difference is exaggerated by simple comparisons of
income around age 62. In fact, the median earlier
Social Security taker is found to have more net assets
than the median postponer. When we use net assets
as a measure of economic well-being, the differ-
ences between the two groups are much smaller.
What we show, however, is that relatively small
differences between the median early Social Security
taker and postponer mask large differences within
the groups with respect to economic well-being.
Both early Social Security takers and postponers who
are healthy live in households whose income and net
assets are greater than those of nonhealthy takers
and postponers. Also, both takers and postponers
who are healthy are less likely to live in poverty than
are nonhealthy takers or postponers. Hence, while
nonhealthy men (less than one in five) and women
(about one in four) are a minority of the retirement
age population, they are at far greater risk of lower
economic well-being and poverty than are the
healthy majority, regardless of whether or not they
take early Social Security benefits.
Our results suggest that raising the early Social
Security retirement age is not likely to dramatically
lower the economic well-being of the typical person
aged 62, since the majority of men and women aged
62 in 1993 or 1994 did not take benefits at age 62. But
more importantly, the majority of those who do take
Social Security benefits while they are age 62 are
neither in poor health nor dependent on Social Secu-
rity benefits alone for their pension income. None-
theless, a small minority of men and women aged 62
are in poor health and, on average, they live in
households with substantially less income and net
assets than the healthy majority. When raising the
early retirement age, other policies should be put in
place that provide some alternative source of income
for this relatively small minority of vulnerable older
persons.

Notes
1. These estimates are based on the intermediate as-
sumption in the Social Security Trustees Annual Re-
port (Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust
Funds, 1995).
2. For a detailed discussion of the various alternatives for
bringing the Social Security system into long-term bal-
ance, see Mitchell and Quinn (1995).
3. The evidence of increased life expectancy in the
United States is universally accepted. See, for in-
stance, Department of Health and Human Services
(1991) for a summary of this evidence and projections
of future changes in life expectancy. The evidence with
respect to whether longer life is increasingly associ-
ated with better rather than worse health is less power-
ful but tends to support the view that health has also
improved. See, for instance, Crimmins, Saito, and
Ingegneri (1989); Manton, Corder, and Stallard (1993);
and most recently Manton, Stallard, and Corder (1995).
4. Quinn (1987) first observed that while the average
economic well-being of older people has dramatically
increased since the 1960s, pockets of poverty persist.
See Holtz-Eakin and Smeeding (1994) for a recent anal-
ysis of the economic well-being of older persons.
5. As is true of most economic datasets -- Current Popula-
tion Survey (CPS), Panel Study of Income Dynamics,
etc. -- while most information is based on conditions at
the time of the survey, information on income is based
on the previous year. Hence, in the HRS, Wave 1 con-
tains employment, health, and net asset characteristics
for 1992 but income information for 1991, and Wave 2
contains employment, health, and net asset character-
istics for 1994 but income information for 1993.
6. It is important to note that for this article eligibility is
gauged solely by age. As will be seen, some people with
health limitations are observed to not take Social Secu-
rity benefits while they are age 62. One reason may be
that they are in fact ineligible. For this reason and
others mentioned elsewhere in the article, all of the
conclusions presented here should be seen as prelimi-
nary in nature. When matched data from Social Security
records become available, it will be possible to further
refine our sample to exclude those who are not in the
population of potential recipients while age 62.
7. While Social Security retirement or spouse benefits
cannot be received prior to age 62, it is possible to
receive Social Security disability benefits or widow
benefits at younger ages. Since those receiving such
benefits will not be directly affected by an increase in
the early retirement age for Social Security, we exclude
those persons receiving such benefits from our analy-
sis. If an individual age 62 receives a joint benefit with
their spouse who is also age 62, each of them is
counted as a beneficiary, and each is considered inde-
pendently in the data. A data appendix that provides a
more complete discussion of the sample will be pro-
vided by the authors upon request.
8. One reason why our percentage employed is greater
than the CPS labor force participation rate is that we
exclude from the sample all men who receive Social
Security disability benefits prior to age 62. Presumably
none of these men would be employed.
9. This is only one of the available health measures in the
HRS. We replicated the tables in this study using self-
reported health (good, bad, etc.) and found similar
results. As our analysis focuses on the nexus between
early Social Security benefit receipt, health, and em-
ployment, our work impairment measure seems best
suited to the topic.
10. Net assets in this article is defined as the sum of the net
value of real estate, transportation, businesses,
checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit,
IRA and Keogh accounts, stocks and mutual funds,
bonds, and a miscellaneous category for assets and
debts not covered in the previous groups. The asset
values of pensions (employer and Social Security) are
not included in this measure of net assets. For a more
complete discussion of our calculation of net assets,
see Table 2.
11. Eventually the wealth value of private pensions will be
included with the HRS data. It was not available at the
time we were writing this paper.
12. The preliminary version of Wave 2 HRS data we are
using did not have a reliable measure of pension eligi-
bility at the time of this writing. But pension eligibility,
unlike acceptance, is unlikely to change over the two-
year period. Hence, it appears the vast majority of
those eligible to receive a private pension who take
early Social Security benefits also take their private
pension by 1994.
13. One reason for the difference in household pension
income is that only 58% of female postponers were
married in 1994 compared to 72% of takers.
14. We subdivide early Social Security takers by health and
pension status to identify those likely to be most vul-
nerable to drops in economic well-being if Social Secu-
rity benefits were available at age 62 -- those in poor
health and without other sources of pension income.
We had the choice of using a variable identifying those
receiving pension income or a variable identifying
798 The Gerontologist
eligibility for pension income as our measure of pen-
sion status. We chose pension income even though
pension eligibility is likely to be a better gauge of
pension wealth because the pension eligibility variable
in the preliminary Wave 2 release of data is relatively
unclean with several missing values. However, when
we used this eligibility measure, only eight men and
women moved from the healthy single pension group
to the healthy dual pension group. Since the results of
our analysis do not significantly change as a result of
using either definition of employer pension status, we
utilize the "cleaner" pension receipt variable to create
our subgroups.
15. This sizeable reduction in median net assets is based
on a small sample (19 individuals). Nonetheless, this
loss does not appear to be associated with any sizeable
loss of household income over the period. This
suggests that changes in health status from good to
bad (notice that 53% of this population reports good
health two years earlier) may have a greater impact on
net assets than on income. Presumably, this is because
of the availability of dual pension income when a
health condition begins to affect one's ability to work.
While we observe this classic protective attribute of
our dual pension system among this group, it is
important to note that deteriorating health is not the
typical experience of dual pensioners, most of whom
are healthy in both periods.
