Background: Depression remains a major public health problem that is most often evaluated and
treated in primary care settings. The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence, treatment,
and control of depressive symptoms in a national data sample using a common primary care screening
tool for depression.
Methods: We analyzed a sample of adults (n  4836) from 2005 to 2008 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey data. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Question-
naire (PHQ-9) to determine the overall prevalence, rates of treatment, and antidepressant control of
mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depressive symptoms.
Results: Of the sample, 20.1% reported significant depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, >5),
the majority of whom had mild depressive symptoms (PHQ-9) score, 5­9). Even among individuals
with severe depressive symptoms, a large percentage (36.9%) received no treatment from a mental
health professional or with antidepressant medication. Of those taking antidepressants, 26.4% re-
ported mild depressive symptoms and 18.8% had moderate, moderately severe, or severe depres-
sive symptoms.
Conclusions: Despite greater awareness and treatment of depression in primary care settings,
the prevalence of depressive symptoms remains high, treatment levels remain low, and control of
depressive symptoms are suboptimal. Primary care providers need to continue to focus their ef-
forts on diagnosing and effectively treating this important disease. (J Am Board Fam Med 2011;24:

Depression continues to be major cause of illness and
disability throughout the world.1­5 The World
Health Organization identified depression as the
fourth leading cause of total disease burden and the
leading cause of disability worldwide.6 In the United
States, recent samples estimate a lifetime depres-
sion prevalence of 16.2% and a 12-month prev-
alence of 6.6%.7
In the past, depression was often underdiag-
nosed and untreated by physicians in primary care
settings.8 Studies of elderly patients in primary care
settings suggest that complex patients with multiple
comorbidities have a higher risk of depression,
which is more closely associated with their overall
burden of illness than with any one specific dis-
ease.9 Although rates of treatment are increasing,
many people still do not have adequate control of
depressive symptoms.7 A recent study of a large
national sample found that few Americans diag-
nosed with depression receive guideline-concor-

dant treatment, with racial/ethnic minority popula-
tions receiving even less treatment than non-Hispanic
whites.10 However, management and treatment of
depression in primary care settings is an important
issue; previous research has shown that individuals are
more likely to seek mental health treatment in pri-
mary care settings rather than in specialty mental
health clinics. This is particularly true of racial and
ethnic minority populations.11
The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) has been used to assess
nationwide levels of treatment and control of other
chronic diseases12 but not depression. According to
Cutler et al,13 NHANES has become "the principal
means to track progress in preventing, treating, and
controlling hypertension," guiding national initia-
tives such as the National High Blood Pressure
Education program. In recent versions of the
NHANES, use of the Patient Health Question-
naire (PHQ)-9 has allowed for greater accuracy in
the diagnoses of mild, moderate, moderately se-
vere, and severe depressive symptoms.14 Gonzales
et al10 assessed treatment and control rates in a
mutliethnic national sample using Collaborative
Psychiatric Epidemiology Survey data, but the di-
agnostic instrument used, the 16-item Quick In-
ventory of Depressive Symptomology--Self Re-
port is not as commonly used in primary care
settings as the PHQ-9. To date, there has been no
published study assessing prevalence, treatment,
and control using the nationally recognized
NHANES dataset and the PHQ-9 instrument,
which is widely used to screen for depression and to
guide ongoing treatment decisions in primary care
and psychiatric settings. Therefore, we examined
prevalence of depressive symptoms, rates of treat-
ment, and overall levels of treatment response us-
ing the PHQ-9 data in 2005 to 2008 NHANES
data.
Methods
Design
The NHANES is designed to assess the health and
nutritional status of Americans by combining inter-
views and physical examinations.15 The surveys
have been conducted annually by the National
Center for Health Statistics since 1999, using a
complex multistage sampling design to obtain a
representative sample of the civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population of the United States. The
NHANES oversamples minorities and allows for
population estimates using population totals from
the Current Population Surveys. To obtain an ad-
equate sample size for the analyses we combined
the data from the 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2008
NHANES, for a potential total sample size of
11,791 adults aged 18 and older.
Measures
Depressive symptoms were assessed using the
PHQ-9, a 9-item screening tool that asks partici-
pants to choose 1 of 4 responses about the fre-
quency of depressive symptoms during the previous
2 weeks.14 Those scoring 10 were characterized
as having moderate, moderately severe, or severe
depressive symptoms.
Antidepressant use was defined as taking at least
one prescribed antidepressant medication in the
past 30 days, as characterized by the Multum Lex-
icon Drug Database.16 During the household in-
terview, survey participants were asked if they had
taken a medication in the past month for which
they needed a prescription. Those who answered
"yes" were asked to show the interviewer the med-
ication containers of all the medications used.
Although the NHANES does not provide de-
tails on psychological counseling, we defined coun-
seling and various types of therapy as treatment
with a mental health professional, which was mea-
sured by the survey question, "During the past 12
months, have you seen or talked to a mental health
professional such as a psychologist, psychiatrist,
psychiatric nurse, or clinical social worker about
your health?"
Because evidenced-based treatment recommen-
dations for prescribing antidepressant medication
and/or administering psychotherapy exist for indi-
viduals with PHQ-9 scores 15, we specifically
examined all forms of treatment among respon-
dents that scored 15 on the PHQ-9. Evidence-
based treatment recommendations for individuals
with a PHQ-9 score 10 involve a strategy of
watchful waiting and reassessment for antidepres-
sant treatment or psychotherapy after 2 months.17
Statistical Analysis
Frequencies, population estimates, standard errors,
and 95% CIs taking into account the complex sam-
pling design and population weights were gener-
ated by Proc Crosstabs in SAS-callable SUDAAN
version 9 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
34 JABFM January­February 2011 Vol. 24 No. 1 http://www.jabfm.org
Triangle Park, NC). First, overall prevalence of
depressive symptoms and prevalence of the differ-
ent depressive symptom severity categories were
assessed for the entire adult population. Treatment
(mental health professional and/or antidepressant)
use by depressive symptom severity was then as-
sessed. Prevalence of depressive symptoms, depres-
sive symptom severity, and treatment among dif-
ferent age-sex groups was also examined.
Results
Among the total sample, 10,283 adults completed
the PHQ-9. Based on their scores, 2,399 had de-
pressive symptoms, representing 42,116,283 US
adults (21.6%; 95% CI, 20.1­23.3), with 14.8%
endorsing mild depressive symptoms, 4.52% en-
dorsing moderate depressive symptoms, 1.8% en-
dorsing moderately severe depressive symptoms,
and 0.6% endorsing severe depressive symptoms.
Table 1 shows the percentage of the population
with depressive symptoms, categorized by age and
sex.
Among individuals with moderately severe and
severe depressive symptoms (for which guidelines
recommend treatment with an antidepressant),
17.0% (95% CI, 12.7­22.6) received treatment
with an antidepressant only; 17.6% (95% CI, 12.0­
25.1) had seen a mental health professional only;
and 14.8% (95% CI, 10.8­19.9) received ideal
treatment of antidepressant and treatment by a
mental health professional. Even among adults
with the most severe depressive symptoms (PHQ-9
score 20), only 24.8% (95% CI, 12.1­44.0) had
combined treatment with an antidepressant and a
mental health professional, whereas a large per-
centage (36.9%; 95% CI, 24.8­51.0) received no
form of treatment either from a mental health pro-
fessional or with antidepressant medication (see
Table 2).
Of the 10.4% of the US population currently
taking antidepressant medications, 54.9% (95% CI,
51.2­58.5) were not currently experiencing depres-
sive symptoms. Ongoing mild depressive symptoms
continued to be reported by 26.4% (95% CI, 23.6­
29.4); 11.9% (95% CI, 9.5­14.7) endorsed moder-
ate depressive symptoms; 4.9% (95% CI, 3.8­6.3)
endorsed moderately severe depressive symptoms;
and 2.0% (95% CI, 1.2­3.3) endorsed severe de-
pressive symptoms.
Discussion
This study demonstrates the significant gap be-
tween optimal depression care and population-
based, real-world measures of care. Given that such
a large segment of the US population (roughly 1 in
5 adults, or 42.1 million Americans) screened pos-
itive for at least mild depressive symptoms, it may
be seen as a major challenge to our nation's health
if such a burdensome disease is so frequently undi-
agnosed, untreated, or undertreated. In many ways
it is analogous to the gap between prevalence of
elevated blood pressure in the population and levels

of detection, treatment, and "treat-to-target" con-
trol of hypertension. Although impressive gains
have been made (for example, the proportion of
hypertensive patients with at least partially con-
trolled blood pressure, defined by blood pressure
160/95, rose from 16% in 1972 to 67% in
1991);18 still, only 34% of patients with hyperten-
sion have blood pressure completely under control,
25% are partially treated but uncontrolled, 11%
are taking no medication, and 30% are unaware
that they even have high blood pressure. Eisenberg
and Power19 used the phrase "voltage drop" to
describe the gap between potentially achievable
outcomes and those outcomes actually achieved in
real-world practice settings, and ultimately in com-
munity-based populations.
Primary care clinicians approach patients not as
single disease or risk factors, but as whole persons,
understanding that depression confers a direct bur-
den of suffering but also complicates the manage-
ment of various other chronic diseases or risk fac-
tors. For example, the epidemiologic evidence for
an association between depression and cardiovas-
cular risk is quite strong.20,21 Depression preva-
lence is also higher among individuals with diabe-
tes,22 and depression is correlated with poor
glycemic control. Depression and metabolic syn-
drome are correlated as well, and each is an inde-
pendent predictor of adverse cardiac outcomes.23
Beyond considering depression as a risk factor,
however, depression is also a disabling disease unto
itself, accounting for disability, reduced quality of
life, loss of work days, damage to relationships, and
even suicide.24,25 Although recognition of depres-
sion has improved, our data show that more than
half of US adults with depressive symptoms are
untreated, and 3 of 4 people with severe depressive
symptoms are not taking antidepressant medica-
tions. Treatment to remission significantly reduces
relapse rates in depression; however, almost half of
people taking antidepressants have not achieved
remission of depressive symptoms.26
Formal screening protocols in primary care
practices identify many more patients with depres-
sive symptoms than are diagnosed in usual care
models. There is an emerging body of evidence to
suggest that although screening protocols do detect
more cases of depression, they do not by them-
selves reduce the burden of disease or even improve
outcomes.27 The US Preventive Services Task
Force only recommends screening adults for de-
pression in clinical practices that have systems to
ensure accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and
follow-up. However, when coupled with struc-
tured approaches to depression care management
such as the 3-component model, which integrates
nurse care managers and mental health profes-
sionals into the primary care practice team,
improved outcomes can be achieved. The (Pre-
vention of Suicide in Primary Care Elderly: Col-
laborative Trial) study showed that medical com-
plexities and comorbid chronic disease common
to general internal medicine practices affect
treatment outcomes for depression in usual-care
settings, but that the impact of comorbidities on
depression outcomes can be eliminated with a
more intensive approach to depression care.28
There are limitations to our study. The use of a
national survey provides generalizable data we can
apply to the entire noninstitutionalized US popu-
lation, but it does lack the clinical specificity that
might be obtained from direct review of clinical

records. The PHQ-9 is a self-administered instru-
ment validated for screening, diagnosis, and assess-
ment of the severity of depressive symptoms, with a
sensitivity and specificity of 88% each for major
depression.14 It is more easily adapted to high-
volume primary care settings than instruments such
as the Zung or Hamilton Depression Rating Scales.
Using a PHQ-9 score 5 to indicate mild, mod-
erate, moderately severe, or severe depressive
symptoms, NHANES provides a higher prevalence
estimate (21.6%, or more than 40 million Ameri-
cans) than other recent surveys. However, combin-
ing only moderate, moderately severe, and severe
depressive symptoms gives a point prevalence of
6.8%, which is more consistent with other national
estimates of a prevalence over a 12-month period of
6.6%.7 This may indicate that other instruments
are not detecting mild depressive symptoms, or that
the PHQ-9 threshold of 5 may be overly sensitive
but not specific.
It is possible that individuals who screened pos-
itive on the NHANES PHQ-9 underreported
treatment, either because of recall errors or addi-
tional factors (eg, stigma associated with mental
illness and its treatment). In addition, individuals
who report taking an antidepressant drug may be
taking it for conditions other than depressive symp-
toms and therefore have low PHQ-9 scores. This
would lead to an overestimate of the proportion of
the population treated to remission, which is al-
ready low. We also have no repeated measures or
longitudinal tracking to assess the impact of treat-
ment on recently diagnosed individuals, or to esti-
mate the rate of partial response to treatment
(50% reduction in PHQ-9 score).
Furthermore, individuals with bipolar depres-
sion may have elevated PHQ-9 scores, but may be
prescribed mood stabilizers rather than antidepres-
sants for treatment of depressive symptoms. Al-
though this represents an extremely small number
of individuals, it could lead to a slight underesti-
mate of antidepressant treatment rates for individ-
uals with moderately severe or severe depressive
symptoms.
Conclusion
Despite these limitations, these nationally repre-
sentative data provide a cross-sectional US popula-
tion estimate of the prevalence of mild, moderate,
moderately severe, and severe depressive symp-
toms. They also demonstrate that a substantial pro-
portion of persons with symptoms of depression in
the United States remain untreated or under-
treated. The burden of illness represented by de-
pression care, as well as new evidence suggesting
that care and outcomes systematically can be im-
proved, suggest important opportunities for opti-
mizing the treatment of depression in primary care
and community health settings as a means of im-
proving overall population health.
