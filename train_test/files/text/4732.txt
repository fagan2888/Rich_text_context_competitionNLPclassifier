Abstract
Objective: To compare the aortic diameter after isolated aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients
with a bicuspid (BAV) or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) and an initially normal ascending aorta.
Methods: Patients with an ascending aortic diameter of < 45mm who had undergone isolated AVR
were studied. Ultrasonic cardiographic measurements of the ascending aortic diameter made pre-
and postoperatively and follow-up data concerning adverse aortic events and death were analyzed.
Results: A total of 613 patients were included in this retrospective study; of these, 211 had a BAV
and 402 had a TAV. In both groups, the ascending aorta significantly expanded but was non-
aneurysmal during follow-up; however, the difference between the two groups was not significant.
Cox regression analysis showed no significant effect associated with the presence of a BAV on
adverse aortic events or death.
Conclusion: Dilatation of the ascending aorta was observed after AVR in both groups, but was
not more pronounced in patients with a BAV. Long-term follow-up for ascending aortic aneurysm
is necessary after AVR in both patients with a BAV and those with a TAV.

Introduction
A bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most
common congenital cardiac anomaly and
has a prevalence of 1­2% in the general
population.1 The clinical presentation of
BAV disease is heterogeneous but it pre-
dominantly manifests as aortic stenosis,
aortic insufficiency or mixed lesions of
valvular dysfunction, and approximately
50% of patients with a BAV require aortic
valve replacement (AVR).2
In addition to valvular dysfunction, BAV
is associated with a variety of vascular
abnormalities, such as aortic dilatation,
coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic
arch, anomalous coronary ostium and patent
ductus arteriosus, with enlargement of the
ascending aorta being the most common
anomaly.3­5 The aortic root diameter is sig-
nificantly greater in children and adults with
a functionally normal BAV compared with
those with a tricuspid aortic valve (TAV),
independent of the effect of haemodynamic
disturbances caused by aortic stenosis or
aortic regurgitation,6 and progressive
enlargement or dilatation of the aorta has
been documented, even after AVR.7,8
However, it is not clear whether dilatation
of the remaining aorta after AVR is related to
the presence of a BAV, as several institutions
have reported analogous dimensions in the
remaining aorta of patients with a BAV
compared with patients with a TAV.9­11
It is therefore important to compare dila-
tation of the ascending aorta after AVR in
patients with a BAV and those with a TAV.
In the present retrospective study, the diam-
eter of the ascending aorta and adverse aortic
events were studied in patients with either a
BAV or a TAV who had undergone AVR
without aortic intervention.
Patients and methods
Patients
The records of consecutive patients ! 18years
old with an initially normal diameter aorta
(< 45 mm) who had undergone isolated AVR
in Fu Wai Hospital, Peking Union Medical
College and Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences, Beijing, China, between January
2002 and December 2008 were studied.
Patients with Marfan's syndrome or other
known connective tissue diseases, those with a
TAV functioning as a BAV or a valve with
four or more cuspids, patients with acute
or chronic dissection, those undergoing a
repeat procedure and patients requiring
replacement of the arch and descending
thoracic aorta were excluded from the study.
The study protocol was approved by the
institutional review board at Fu Wai Hospital
and Cardiovascular Institute, Peking Union
Medical College and Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences, Beijing, China. The
requirement for patient consent was waived
due to the retrospective nature of the study.
Surgical procedure and
perioperative assessment
All patients underwent preoperative exam-
ination of the entire heart and ascending
aorta using ultrasonic cardiography (UCG).
The AVR was performed according to the
standard surgical procedure used in our
institution. The involved valve was replaced
with either a mechanical or biological valve
prosthesis under the support of full cardio-
pulmonary bypass, leaving the non-dilated
ascending aorta untreated. The indication
for AVR was based on the current surgical
guidelines but was ultimately at the sur-
geon's discretion.
The valve phenotype (BAV or TAV) was
determined intraoperatively and confirmed
by UCG and pathological examination. The
pattern of the valve and the ascending aorta
were assessed using UCG during the oper-
ation. The diameter of the proximal ascend-
ing aorta was obtained from the parasternal
long-axis view using two-dimensional mode,
as this depicts the maximum aortic diameter
perpendicular to the long axis of the aorta.
Zhang et al. 1223
All aortic diameters were measured at end-
diastole using the leading edge-to-leading
edge convention. When the AVR has been
completed, transoesophageal echocardiog-
raphy was used to evaluate the function
of the valve prosthesis and the ascending
aorta. UCG was performed by two cardiac
surgeons and two cardiologists specializing
in echocardiography. Postoperative compli-
cations were documented.
Follow up
Follow-up information was obtained from
annual outpatient reviews or telephone
follow up (which was offered to those
unable to attend an outpatient review). All
postoperative imaging data and echocardi-
ography reports obtained from our institu-
tion or from hospitals with comparable
techniques and standards were analyzed.
Adverse aortic events, defined as an enlarged
ascending aorta requiring medical treat-
ment, aortic dissection or aneurysm, and
all causes of death were recorded. For all
out-of-hospital deaths, sudden cardiac death
was confirmed or excluded. Aortic aneurysm
was defined as dilatation of the aorta to
greater than 1.5 times the normal size.
Statistical analyses
Categorical variables were expressed as
percentages, and continuous variables
were expressed as the mean Æ SD (range).
Analysis of freedom from events was
performed according to the methods of
Kaplan­Meier, and significant differences
were analyzed using the log-rank test.
A multivariable analysis (Cox regression)
of the risk factors for total aortic events and
death was performed. A number of variables
(presence of BAV, baseline characteristics,
ascending aorta data, valve dysfunction,
intraoperative variables, in-hospital out-
comes and the need for coronary artery
intervention) were initially screened using a
univariate model and were considered for
clinical relevance before being included in
the multivariate model. A P-value < 0.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS software version 18.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
A total of 613 patients were included in the
study. Of these, 211 had a BAV and 402 had
a TAV.
Baseline characteristics
Baseline patient characteristics are summar-
ized in Table 1. There were no significant
differences between the TAV and BAV
groups in terms of age, gender, body surface
area, compromised heart function (grade III/
IV based on the New York Heart Association
functional classification12 or the presence of
peripheral arterial disease. The proportion
with arterial hypertension (systemic blood
pressure> 140/90mmHg recorded at mul-
tiple measurements) was significantly differ-
ent in the two groups (P ¼ 0.033).
The diameter of the ascending aorta
before AVR was not significantly different
between the two groups (Table 1). However,
when divided according to the diameter of
the ascending aorta into a normal subgroup
(<40 mm) and a relatively normal subgroup
(! 40 mm but < 45 mm), the BAV group had
a significantly larger proportion of patients
in the relatively normal subgroup compared
with the TAV group (P ¼ 0.04).
Most patients had a dysfunctional aortic
valve, which manifested as aortic valve sten-
osis (n¼ 115), aortic valve regurgitation
(n ¼ 138) or combined dysfunction (n¼ 355);
four patients with infective endocarditis
with vegetation had normal valve function
(Table 1). Patients with stenosis were divided
into mild (>1.5 cm2), moderate (1.0­1.5 cm2)
or severe (< 1.0cm2) subgroups based on the

preoperative stenotic area on UCG. In both
the BAV and the TAV group, severe stenosis
of the aortic valve accounted for a higher
proportion of those with stenosis compared
with the other subgroups. A combination of
stenosis and regurgitation was seen in more
than half of the patients in both groups
(Table 1).
Perioperative data
Procedural, intraoperative and in-hospital
outcome data are presented in Table 2.
There were no significant differences in
cardiopulmonary bypass time or operation
time between the two groups. Mechanical
prostheses were used as replacement valves
in the majority of patients.
There were no in-hospital deaths in either
group. The major complication was post-
operative bleeding requiring surgical inter-
vention, which occurred in three patients in
the BAV group and 14 patients in the TAV
group; however, this difference was not
statistically significant. Most of the patients
had a smooth, quick recovery, with a short
and similar length of stay in the intensive
care unit. However, some patients (n < 10)
remained in hospital for > 1 month due to
infection or delayed healing.
Follow-up data
Follow-up data were obtained in all
613 patients. The distribution of the max-
imum follow-up times is given in Figure 1.
The mean follow-up time was comparable
in the two groups (5.6 Æ 2.2 years in the
BAV group versus 5.3 Æ 2.2 years in TAV
group). The overall mean follow-up time was
5.4 Æ2.2 years.
Significant dilatation of the ascending
aorta was observed during follow-up in
both groups, with pre- and postoperative
diameters of 34.4 Æ 5.2 mm and 37.1Æ 6.4 m,
respectively (P < 0.001) in the BAV group
and 33.3Æ 4.9 mm and 35.4Æ 5.9 mm,
respectively (P < 0.001) in the TAV group.
The individual diameters of the ascending
aorta in all patients are shown in Figure 2;
there was no significant difference in the
level of increase in ascending aortic diameter
between the two groups. Additionally, a
significant reduction in left ventricular
volume and improved heart ejection fraction
were observed postoperatively in both groups

valve who had undergone aortic valve replacement.

(Figure 3); again, there were no significant
differences between the two groups.
Follow-up data concerning aortic dilata-
tion and cardiac function are given in
Table 3. Adverse aortic events and deaths
were mostly related to the cardiovascular
system in both the BAV and the TAV group,
with the proportion of cardiac and non-
cardiac causes being similar in both groups.
One patient in the BAV group underwent
replacement of the ascending aorta because
of progression of aortic dissection, while two
patients in the TAV group suffered an aortic
dissection and underwent further surgery.
One patient in the BAV group experienced
sudden death during UCG evaluation due to
rupture of an aortic dissection.
Data concerning freedom from aortic
events and death are given in Figure 4.
There were no significant differences
between the endpoint values for the BAV
group (64.0%) and the TAV group (45.7%).
All variables were screened using uni-
variate analysis. Cox regression analysis was
performed on four of these variables to
identify independent risk factors for aortic
events and death. Of these, preoperative
mixed dysfunction of the valve and pre-
operative diameter of the ascending aorta
were shown to be significant predictors of
adverse aortic events and death (Table 4).
Discussion
In the present study of 613 patients who had
undergone isolated AVR surgery, post-
operative dilatation of the ascending aorta
was compared in those with a BAV and
those with a TAV after a mean follow-up
time of 5.4 Æ 2.2 years.
Since a link between BAVs and ascending
aortic aneurysms was first suggested by
Abbott in 1928,13 the optimal management
of patients with BAV disease, especially
when combined with ascending aortic
aneurysm, has been the focus of numerous
studies. An AVR is often considered to be a
necessary intervention, and an aortoplasty
or aortic root replacement is often also
performed when the BAV is associated

with dilatation of the ascending aorta.
Updated practice guidelines and several
studies14­17 support the generally accepted
practice that an aorta dilated to a diameter
! 45 mm should be considered for concomi-
tant replacement. However, it is controver-
sial whether normal or mildly dilated
ascending aortas should be treated at the
initial time of AVR.
Several studies have demonstrated pro-
gressive enlargement of the aorta after AVR
in patients with a BAV. Yasuda et al.8
reported progressive dilatation of the aorta
in BAV patients both with and without
AVR; the results of this small study sug-
gested that AVR could not prevent progres-
sive aortic dilatation in BAV. Russo et al.18
reported on 100 patients with a BAV
or a TAV followed up after AVR for
234 Æ47 months; patients with hypertension
or Marfan's syndrome were excluded. At
the final time point, the mean diameter of
the ascending aorta in the BAV group
(48.4 mm) was significantly larger than in
the TAV group (36.8 mm). They therefore
recommended prophylactic replacement of
even a seemingly normal or mildly enlarged
ascending aorta during AVR in patients

with a BAV; they also recommended con-
sidering a similar approach for any other
cardiac surgical procedures in patients with
a BAV.18
In the study of Borger et al.,17 patients
with a BAV who had undergone AVR
without aortic replacement were divided
into three groups based on the size of the
ascending aorta at the initial operation. The
15-year freedom from ascending aorta-
related complications was 86% and 81% in
patients with an aortic diameter of < 40 mm
and 40­44 mm, respectively, which was sig-
nificantly higher than in those with an aortic
diameter of 45­49 mm (43%). However,
these authors did not further analyze

the differences between the < 40 mm and
40­44 mm groups.
Abdulkareem et al.9 also reported that
only BAV patients with an aortic diameter
of ! 45 mm required aortic replacement
surgery. Patients with mild aortic dilatation
(40­45 mm) had good outcomes that were
comparable to those with non-dilated aortas
(< 40 mm); therefore, these authors did not
see the need for aortic replacement for
smaller diameters.9
In the present study, adult patients with
a BAV or a TAV with an ascending aorta
with a normal or relatively normal diameter
showed a significant increase in aortic diam-
eter after AVR; however, no significant
difference was found between the two
groups. This suggests that a BAV may not
be a risk factor for dilatation of the ascend-
ing aorta post-AVR. Additionally, despite
the presence of dilatation, the diameter of
the ascending aorta did not increase to the
point of aneurysm and did not require
further surgical intervention. Improved ven-
tricular function and ejection fraction were
seen in both groups after surgery.
That a BAV is not a risk factor for
dilatation of the ascending aorta post-AVR
was supported by multivariable Cox regres-
sion analysis of the risk factors for total
aortic events and death in the present study.
In most published articles, the presence or
severity of aortic valve dysfunction has been
considered to be a risk factor for aortic
dilatation or even dissection.19­21 In the
present study, the presence of a mixed
aortic valve lesion was a risk factor for
dilatation of the remaining ascending aorta
(P ¼ 0.045). However, the presence of a BAV
alone did not have a significant influence.
This finding may be explained by the distri-
bution of the UCG results, which differs a
little from the results of other researchers
who reported valve stenosis in the majority of
patients due to valve morphology.22,23 The
other risk factor identified in the present
study was the preoperative diameter of the
ascending aorta (P < 0.001). This result is in
accordance with Laplace's Law, which states
that for a given pressure the wall tension in a
vessel is proportional to the radius, and is
supported by other studies.9,24
Although a significantly faster aortic
dilatation rate has been reported in patients
with a BAV compared with patients with a
TAV,25 in the present study there was no
significant difference in aortic dilatation
between the BAV and TAV groups during
the follow-up period. In addition, the pre-
sence of a BAV was not a significant
predictor of later aortic events or death.
This observation is consistent with the
results of a study in which cross-sectional
analysis of echocardiographic data was per-
formed in 595 patients undergoing isolated
AVR.26 In a further longitudinal follow-up

study aimed at evaluating aortic expansion
rates, no difference between the BAV and
TAV groups was reported.27
In the present study, coronary artery
intervention did not significantly increase
the risk of total aortic events or death. This
finding is in agreement with the results of
Girdauskas et al.,28 who studied a total of
325 consecutive patients with aortic valve
stenosis and concomitant ascending aortic
dilatation (diameter of 40­50 mm) who
underwent isolated AVR; they found that
mildly to moderately dilated ascending
aortas in patients with BAV or TAV stenosis
behaved similarly during 15 years of follow-
up. As surgical techniques develop and
improve, the incidence of such adverse
aortic events should decrease.
The present study was a retrospective
analysis, with all the known limitations of
this type of study design. In addition, a
limitation of the present study was that BAV
subtypes were not identified, as information
concerning subtypes or the echocardio-
graphic parameters necessary for identifica-
tion were not consistently available.
A further limitation was that the size of
the ascending aorta during the initial aortic
valve operation was only assessed by UCG,
which is not as precise as computed tomog-
raphy, magnetic resonance imaging or other
imaging modalities; it has been reported that
the diameter of the ascending aorta is
underestimated by UCG.29,30 UCG is still
a well-proven modality for accurately mea-
suring the size of the ascending aorta during
routine outpatient examinations without the
accompanying radiation hazards of other
methods, and it is also acceptable in assess-
ment of the ascending aorta during follow-
up.31 However, we believe a more accurate
method of measurement should be used in
further studies.
In conclusion, the present study demon-
strated that in adult patients with a BAV or
a TAV with an initially non-dilated ascend-
ing aorta (< 45 mm), the remaining aorta
expanded after AVR but did not require
additional intervention. The presence of a
BAV did not significantly contribute to
the extent of dilatation of the ascending
aorta postoperatively. However, the pre-
operative diameter of the ascending aorta
was a significant predictor of adverse aortic
events and death.
