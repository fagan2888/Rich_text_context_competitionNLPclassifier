Social Marginalization of Overweight Children
Richard S. Strauss, MD; Harold A. Pollack, PhD
Background: Overweight is the most common health
problem that faces children and adolescents. Although
the correlation among overweight, low self-esteem, and
depression is well known, social isolation among over-
weight children and adolescents has not been studied.
Objective: To investigate social networks of over-
weight and normal-weight adolescents in a large, nation-
ally representative sample.
Design: Cross-sectional, nationally representative co-
hort study.
Population: A total of 90118 adolescents aged 13 to 18
years who were enrolled in the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, of which a 1:5 subsample
was selected for detailed in-home assessment, including
height and weight measurements (n=17557). Over-
weight was defined according to body mass index (95th
percentile for age and sex).
Main Outcome Measures: This analysis focuses on
the number of friendship nominations each adolescent
received from other adolescents. The number of friend-
ship nominations and other social network measures were
calculated using statistical software.
Results: Overweight adolescents were more likely to be
socially isolated and to be peripheral to social networks
than were normal-weight adolescents. Although over-
weight adolescents listed similar numbers of friends as
normal-weight adolescents, overweight adolescents re-
ceived significantly fewer friendship nominations from
others than were received by normal-weight adoles-
cents (mean [SE] number of friendship nominations, 3.39
[0.08] vs 4.79 [0.04]; P.001). Overweight adolescents
were also more likely to receive no friendship nomina-
tions than were normal-weight adolescents (odds ratio,
1.71; 95% confidence interval, 1.39-2.20). Decreased tele-
vision viewing (P.001), increased levels of sports par-
ticipation (P.001), and increased participation in school
clubs (P.001) were associated with significantly more
friendship nominations and higher network centrality
scores among both overweight and normal-weight ado-
lescents.
Conclusions: Many overweight adolescents are so-
cially marginalized. Such isolation may aggravate the so-
cial and emotional consequences of overweight in this
age group.

There is no doubt that obesity is an undesirable
state of existence for a child. It is even more
undesirable for an adolescent, for whom even
mild degrees of overweight may act as a
damaging barrier in a society obsessed with
slimness.
Hilde Bruche, 19751
The professional community is concerned with
the medical concomitants of obesity, but the
psychological and social perils are at least as
important to those afflicted by the problem.
The reason is clear; society does not tolerate
excess weight. The effects of this overt and
covert pressure to be thin can be powerful and
permanent.
Brownell and Wadden, 19842
CHILDHOOD OVERWEIGHT is
rapidly increasing.3 With
important exceptions, the
most serious medical se-
quelae of overweight do
not arise until the adult years.4-6 How-
ever, the social and emotional aspects of
overweight are immediate and apparent
and influence many aspects of child and
adolescent well-being, independent of their
concrete health effects.
Few problems in childhood have as
significant an impact on emotional devel-
opment as being overweight. Monello and
Mayer7 observed that overweight girls of-
ten have expectations of rejection and pro-

gressive withdrawal. Many studies find that overweight
adolescents have higher prevalence of depressive symp-
toms8 and lower self-esteem than are found among their
normal-weight peers.9-11 However, other studies report
normal levels of self-esteem.12,13 Differences in age, race,
and income among studies may account for the discrep-
ant findings. For instance, low self-esteem is not char-
acteristic of obese, inner-city, African American chil-
dren14 or obese preschool children.15 Analysis of the data
from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth indi-
cates that early adolescence is a critical time for the de-
velopment of low self-esteem in overweight children.16
Other data indirectly reflect the strong stigma as-
sociated with overweight during childhood and adoles-
cence.17 Studies of children as young as 6 years find that
overweight individuals are likely to be described in de-
rogatory terms.18,19 The studies performed by Richard-
son et al20 in the 1960s indicated that overweight chil-
dren are ranked by other children as the least-desirable
friends. Childhood and adolescent overweight is associ-
ated with adverse social and economic status in subse-
quent adulthood, with particularly strong effects re-
ported among women. Gortmaker and colleagues21 found
that adolescent girls who were overweight in 1981 had
lower earnings, were less likely to be married, and were
more likely to be in poverty than were otherwise com-
parable nonoverweight peers.
Friendship is an essential vehicle for the social and
psychological development of adolescents.22-24 Given the
importance of peer appearance norms, body image, and
physical fitness to social and emotional development,
overweight may have lasting implications for child de-
velopment and adolescent well-being. Yet few studies pro-
vide concrete measures to scrutinize the social implica-
tions of overweight for individuals' friendship ties and
relationships with school peers.
To understand the extent that overweight adoles-
cents may be isolated or socially marginalized in rela-
tionships with school peers, we analyzed data from the
National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add
Health). We explored the social marginalization of over-
weight adolescents, as measured by the most detailed avail-
able nationally representative data set, to explore social
connections among more than 20000 high school stu-
dents for whom biometric data could be obtained.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The study population consisted of 7th to 12th grade adoles-
cents enrolled in wave 1 of Add Health. Add Health is a feder-
ally funded study designed to assess the health status of ado-
lescents and explore causes of health-related behaviors. A novel
feature of Add Health is the collection of detailed friendship
network data. These data provide direct assessment of an in-
dividual respondent's social standing with her school peers. Re-
stricted data were obtained by arrangement with Add Health
after approval from the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey Institutional Review Board.
The primary sample frame for Add Health was the Qual-
ity Education Data database, which is thought to be the most
comprehensive list of high schools available. The sample high
schools were selected systematically, with selection probabili-
ties proportional to the school's enrollment. Before sampling,
the schools were sorted by size, school type (public, paro-
chial, private), census region, level of urbanicity, and percent-
age of white students. Detailed sampling procedures are de-
scribed elsewhere.25 All students who completed an in-school
questionnaire (n=90118), plus those who did not complete the
questionnaire but were listed on the school roster, were eli-
gible for 1:5 random selection for an in-home evaluation. These
data include a broad range of information regarding family in-
come, household composition, academic achievement, and the
presence of other health-related medical conditions.
Complete demographic data were available for more than
90% of the resulting sample. Special oversamples included Af-
rican Americans and Hispanics and a subset of schools from
which all enrolled students were selected. Demographic de-
tails of the cohort are shown in Table 1. The weighted in-
school (n=90118) and in-home (n=20762) samples approxi-
mate a nationally representative, probability-based survey of
adolescents in grades 7 through 12.
OVERWEIGHT
Self-reported weight and height were obtained from the in-
home interview (n=17557: 2908 Hispanic, 3778 African Ameri-
can, 10871 non-Hispanic white). Previous research has vali-
dated self-reported weights and heights as an indicator of
overweight in adolescents.26 Within this specific study, there
was more than 95% concordance of overweight status using both
calculated and measured weights and heights.27 Overweight was
defined as a body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) greater
than the 95th percentile for age and sex (n=1852) derived from
the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics growth curves.28 This defi-
nition is in accordance with recommendations of the expert panel
on childhood obesity.29
SOCIAL NETWORKS
A unique aspect of Add Health is the mapping of social net-
works using data from all (responding) students who at-
tended participating schools (n=90118). Each participating stu-
dent designated his or her 5 best male friends and 5 best female
friends. This study design allows investigators to explore the
interplay between individual characteristics and the social struc-
ture of the school within which the student is enrolled. Add
Health data include the identification number of students iden-

tified or "nominated" by the respondent as friends (out-
degree measure). Using matrix programs (PAJEK, available on
the Internet at http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/pajek; and
SAS IML, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) the connections and re-
lationships between each student were determined (Figure 1).
Social network data were available for more than three quar-
ters (77%) of adolescents with weight and height data. Figure
1 demonstrates a social network of one of the schools with com-
plete friendship data in the Add Health study.
For each adolescent, the number of friendship nomina-
tions from other students was identified (in-degree measure), as
was the total number of friends and friends of friends (extended
network). The group of adolescents who received the most nomi-
nations for friend and best friend were considered the most popu-
lar. Reciprocity represented the likelihood that an individual who
was nominated as best friend also returned the nomination.
We also explore the centrality of Add Health respondents
in their social networks, as captured by the Bonacich mea-
sure.30,31 In brief, these centrality measures compare an indi-
vidual's popularity to that of individuals with whom he or she
is connected. Individuals who have fewer friends than do oth-
ers in their friendship networks would have low centrality scores.
We use centrality measure based on the in-degree social
network. In-degree measures rely on friendship ties reported
by others rather than those identified by self-report. Previous
research identifies in-degree centrality as superior to out-
degree measures in obtaining accurate descriptions of friend-
ship and advice networks.32 In-degree measures are also de-
signed to capture observed differences in social ties and
reciprocity among unpopular, average, and popular adoles-
cents that do not arise in self-reported out-degree measures
among the same respondents.33
SAMPLE BIAS
The completeness of friendship nomination data and BMI data
differed across race/ethnic groups. However, these differences
were small and not likely to influence outcome. Overall, friend-
ship nomination data were available for 77% of adolescents with
calculated BMI z scores (Hispanic, 74.6%; African American,
80.2%; white, 76.3%). Similarly, although there were signifi-
cant sex differences in those with (male, 48%) and without (male,
51%) friendship data, these differences were also relatively small.
There were no significant differences in BMI z scores or obe-
sity prevalence in those with and without friendship nomina-
tion data (mean [SE] BMI z score, 0.34 [0.02] vs 0.29 [0.03];
P=.83; obesity prevalence, 10.6% vs 9.6%; P=.23).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Friendship networks were generated using PAJEK and SAS IML
statistical software.34 Because the survey oversampled African
Americans and Hispanics, we used Add Health sample weights
to provide prevalence estimates corresponding to a national rep-
resentative sample as recommended.34 SEs were adjusted to ac-
count for school-wide clustering using Stata statistical soft-
ware version 7.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, Tex). Differences
in proportions were compared by the 2 test. Multivariate analy-
sis, accounting for the weighted and stratified nature of Add
Health, was used for continuous variables.

Overweight adolescents were less popular than their
normal-weight peers when evaluated by other measures
of social ties. Overweight adolescents were significantly

were normal-weight adolescents and were significantly less
likely to receive 2 or more best friend nominations (Tables
2 and 3). Overweight adolescents were significantly more
likely than normal-weight peers to receive no friendship
nominations (12% vs 7%; odds ratio, 1.71; 95% confi-
denceinterval,1.39-2.20).Adolescentsnominatedbyover-
weight respondents as best friends were less likely to re-
ciprocate the nomination than identified best friends of
normal-weight adolescents (Tables 2 and 3).
We found similar patterns using more global net-
work measures. Bonacich centrality scores, which mea-
sure an adolescent's connection to highly nominated peers,
were significantly lower for overweight adolescents than
for normal-weight adolescents (Tables 2 and 3). The Free-
man betweenness measure of the extent to which social
ties pass through an individual also indicates that over-
weight respondents are significantly less likely to play
an "intermediary" role between well-connected adoles-
centscomparedwithnormal-weightadolescents(P=.004).
Self-reported out-degree network measures ap-
peared to overstate the social connectedness of over-
weight adolescents, as reported by peers. Normal-
weight respondents reported the same mean number of
friendship ties about others (4.58) as others reported about
them (4.79). Overweight respondents provided signifi-
cantly more nominations of others (4.29) than they re-
ceived (3.39). Controlling for ethnicity, sex, parental edu-
cation, family income, school size, and mean school
network density, overweight adolescents received fewer
friendship nominations than did otherwise comparable
normal-weight peers who reported the same number of
out-degree friendship ties (P.001).
We also examined race/ethnic variation in our main
results, with group-specific results provided for the 3 larg-

Hispanic), African American, and Hispanic/Latino ado-
lescents (Table 4). Within our stratified multivariate
analysis, overweight respondents received significantly
fewer friendship nominations in 4 of the 6 examined sub-
groups, with the strongest results found among non-
Hispanic whites of both sexes and among young His-
panic men. Point estimates were notably smaller among
African Americans than among non-Hispanic whites even
after controlling for confounding factors.
Aside from overweight, several covariates were sig-
nificantly associated with friendship nominations
(Figure 3). Decreased hours of television viewing
(P.001),increasedlevelsofsportsparticipation(P.001),
and increased participation in school clubs (P.001) were
associated with significantly more friendship nomina-
tions among both overweight and normal-weight adoles-
cents.Althoughtheeffectsofsportsparticipationwerestron-

ship nominations as a normal-weight adolescent who did
not participate in such activities.
Multivariate analysis also confirmed the relation-
ship between overweight and decreased friendship nomi-
nations (Table 5). We found a robust association be-
tween overweight and in-degree social ties. Our point
estimates were significant and stable across a range of
specifications. In model 1, we examine unadjusted dif-
ferences, finding a mean social penalty of 1.17 nomina-
tions among boys and 1.61 among girls. In model 2, we
control for standard sociodemographic factors and find
virtually identical point estimates among boys and de-
creased point estimates among girls.
Because overweight might reflect sedentary life-
style factors associated with social marginalization, we
control in model 3 for television watching, club partici-
pation, and sports. (Note that if overweight contributes
to increased sedentary activity, model 3 would, in prin-
ciple, understate the impact of overweight on social ties.)

As shown, inclusion of lifestyle factors had little impact
on our results.
Schools may systematically differ in social network
characteristics based on school size (which alters possi-
bilities for social connections), region, economic, or cul-
tural factors. If such variation is correlated with over-
weight prevalence, these patterns could produce a
spurious correlation between overweight and social ties.
To examine this possibility, we included school size and
school-specific network density as covariates in the same
regressions. Inclusion of these effects had a negligible im-
pact on our results for boys and led to slightly stronger
estimated overweight effects among girls.
Finally, the relationship between overweight and de-
creased friendship nominations was seen across almost
all schools studied; overweight adolescents had fewer
friendship nominations than did normal-weight adoles-
cents in 108 (88.7%) of the 123 schools with available
friendship network data. In addition, other chronic child-
hood health conditions (eg, asthma, migraine head-
aches, and chronic abdominal pain), in contrast to over-
weight status, were not associated with decreased
friendship nominations or with decreased network cen-

Manyoverweightadolescentboysandgirlsaresociallymar-
ginalized among their peers. Controlling for other fac-
tors, overweight respondents received fewer friendship
nominations than their normal-weight peers. Over-
weight respondents were less central to their social net-
worksandhadfewerfriendshiptiesthanotherswithwhom
they were connected. Overweight respondents were more
likely to receive no friendship nominations than were their
normal-weight peers. The contrasts in friendship ties be-
tween overweight and normal-weight adolescents match
overall patterns identified by others to distinguish popu-
lar and unpopular children in social network data.23
Overall, the relationship between overweight and so-
cial isolation was moderate in strength; most over-
weight respondents had at least one friendship nomina-
tion, and more than one-quarter had 5 or more friendship
nominations. Although the quality of friendships could
not be assessed, lower rates of reciprocity of best friend
nominations among overweight respondents provide one
suggestive indication that friendship ties involving over-
weight children may also be weaker.
In addition to our main results, we found notewor-
thy differences across the 6 race/ethnic and sex categories
explored.Socialmarginalizationofoverweightchildrenap-
pears most pronounced among non-Hispanic whites, with
thelargestpointestimatesamongyoungwomen.Wefound
smaller effects among both African Americans and His-
panics, a result consistent with other research that sug-
gests racial/ethnic differences in the emotional and social
consequences of overweight and obesity.12,35,36
Although overweight adolescents appear more so-
cially marginalized than other respondents, our multi-
variate analysis suggests that increased participation in
collective activities is associated with improved social ties.
In every subgroup examined, overweight young men and
women who participated in sports and club activities and
who spent fewer hours watching television displayed
greater friendship attachments than their otherwise com-
parable overweight peers.
We hypothesize that social marginalization of over-
weight individuals contributes to reduced self-esteem and
increased depressive symptoms among overweight ado-
lescents. Previous studies have documented that adoles-
cent intimacy and friendships are important determi-
nants of anxiety, depression, self-esteem, and overall
mental health.19 Such patterns may also be especially im-
portant when viewed in light of widespread interest in
"social capital" and the growing literature highlighting
the role of informal ties and "contact networks" in shap-
ing economic status,27 educational attainment,28 job seek-
ing,39 mental health,40 and general well-being.41 The di-
minished social capital available to overweight children
and adolescents, captured by social network measures,
may therefore contribute to the reduced social status and
economic well-being of overweight adults.
From a methodologic perspective, the unique de-
sign of Add Health allows scrutiny of social patterns that
would otherwise go undetected in analyses based solely
on self-report. Self-reported friendship ties by over-
weight adolescents significantly exceed the number of
friendship ties to the same adolescents, as reported by oth-
ers. The desire to provide socially desired responses pro-
vides one possible explanation for these discordant pat-
terns. The Add Health survey design may encourage
respondents to list 5 friends, even if the actual number of
friends is greater or smaller than this number. Respon-
dents may also misperceive others' views of friendship ties.
Cross-sectional studies such as this one also cannot
unpack the causal direction of the linkage between over-
weight and social ties. Both overweight and social margin-
alization may be correlated with other, unmeasured vari-
ables that play a strong causal role. Instrumental variable
methods may help to clarify these relationships.27 From a
clinical perspective, our results underscore that over-

In addition to efforts to improve fitness and nutri-
tion, our results suggest that overweight adolescents may
benefit from increased social activities with their school
peers. Overweight adolescents who participate in sports
and clubs and overweight adolescents who reduce their
television viewing have stronger social ties than other over-
weight respondents. Given the importance of friendship
networks and close friendships in many aspects of ado-
lescent development,18,19 the social disadvantages encoun-
tered by overweight young men and women provide press-
ing reasons for clinical and public health concern.

What This Study Adds
It is generally recognized that obesity and overweight have
a negative impact on self-image and self-esteem in chil-
dren and adolescents. Indirect evidence from past stud-
ies also suggests that overweight children are stigma-
tized. This study provides an assessment of the impact
of being overweight in childhood on friendship net-
works. As a group, overweight children had both fewer
and less reciprocal friendships. However, increased sports
participation, school club participation, and less televi-
sion viewing may mitigate the social isolation of over-
weight adolescents.
