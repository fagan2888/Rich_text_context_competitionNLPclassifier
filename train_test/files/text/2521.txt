Abstract: The purpose of this study is to investigate healthcare access disparity that will
cause delayed and unmet healthcare needs for the elderly, and to examine health inequality
and healthcare cost burden for the elderly. To produce clear policy applications, this study
adapts a modified PRECEDE-PROCEED model for framing theoretical and experimental
approaches. Data were collected from a large collection of the Community Tracking Study
Household Survey 2003足2004 of the USA. Reliability and construct validity are examined
for internal consistency and estimation of disparity and inequality are analyzed by using
probit/ols regressions. The results show that predisposing factors (e.g., attitude, beliefs,
and perception by socio-demographic differences) are negatively associated with delayed
healthcare. A 10% increase in enabling factors (e.g., availability of health insurance
coverage, and usual sources of healthcare providers) are significantly associated with a 1%
increase in healthcare financing factors. In addition, information through a socio-economic
network and support system has a 5% impact on an access disparity. Income, health status,
and health inequality are exogenously determined. Designing and implementing easy
healthcare accessibility (healthcare system) and healthcare financing methods, and
developing a socio-economic support network (including public health information) are
essential in reducing delayed healthcare and health inequality.
Keywords: unmet healthcare needs; delayed healthcare; access and health disparity
1. Introduction
The number of uninsured population in the United States with access to healthcare services at
reasonable costs has been a social and economic problem for their access to healthcare services with
reasonable cost. Insufficient insurance coverage, rising healthcare cost and widening disparity in access
to healthcare services have adversely affected the elderly population [1足4]. Today, healthcare costs are
generating major problems for welfare states in the short-term and long-term. A major concern is the
affordability of healthcare services. A growing number of Americans are delaying or forgoing care due
to the financial burden associated with healthcare costs. This concern is compounded by rising healthcare
costs, which have led to an increase in medical bill payments from about 15% in 2003 to 19.4%
in 2007 [2,5]. Increasing healthcare costs, for which payments include a significant share of
out-of-pocket expenses, tend to result in people deferring needed healthcare treatment. The average
annual healthcare cost has only been rising: 14.1% in 1999, 15.2% in 2001, to 20% in 2007. In recent
years, the average annual rate has slowed relative to the late 1990s and 2000s, but is still expected to
grow faster than national income. It is projected healthcare costs will continue to rise 8 percent to
9 percent per year for the foreseeable future.
Disparity in access to healthcare services, under the mixed private and public US healthcare programs,
elevates inequality of health and health status among Americans [1,6]. Healthcare disparity is a concern
for everyone since it involves a large spread of demographics and a large share in the GDP of the US [7].
Important questions to consider are why have delayed healthcare and unmet healthcare needs been rising;
and if financing healthcare is a major issue, what are the factors that can mitigate the burden. A key
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1747
concern is how healthcare financial burden will be distributed among the different socio-economic status.
Finally, this study will explore how healthcare access disparity and health inequality are generated.
Various research literature supports that access disparities lead to unmet healthcare needs [8足11].
The healthcare disparity gap is a problem that the population will have to disentangle over the next
decade. Even though there has been an increase in the managed care system, which has significantly
reduced the rate of increased healthcare costs; and there has been an improvement in patient-provider
relations, which is related to unmet needs; there is still concern about the disparity in access to healthcare
services [10,12足14]. There is an appealing and distinctive focus on unmet needs [9,10]. Mollborn et al. [9]
examined individuals' trust issues towards physicians. These individuals were ages eighteen years and
older, and who had regularly available healthcare providers. Cunningham and Hadley [10] differentiated
"delayed care" and "unmet needs" and found individuals' trust was associated with improved probability
of receiving met need care from healthcare providers. Both studies showed uninsured individuals
compared to privately insured individuals are more likely to have unmet medical needs. Neither study
showed a clear-cut difference regarding healthcare service accessibility, health disparity, and financial
burden of healthcare among population.
A focus of healthcare financing characteristics with the sample age groups reveals differences in
Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and those uninsured. As healthcare costs rises, more of the
increasing costs are transferred to certain disadvantaged populations, and patients would have to spend
a considerable share of their healthcare costs out-of-pocket. Access disparity for unmet needs and
delayed care is relatively complex health policy measures. Studies may convincingly engage with
defined measures using concepts from a behavioral model. A study would require a comprehensive
analysis of the interfaces and interactions in the nexus of financial characteristics, cognitive aspects,
disparity, and inequality.
In order to fill the gap of precise health financial characteristics with individual behaviors, this study
employs three dimensions of behavioral measures in addition to socio-demographic factors with
different cognitive influences. The three behavioral measures are enabling, predisposing, and reinforcing
factors, which are used to determine the influence of health insurance and different cognitive
characteristics on unmet needs and delayed healthcare for individuals sixty-five years or older with
Medicare. There are three main objectives for this study. First is to shed light on the effects of behavioral
characteristics on accessibility of healthcare services, i.e., unmet needs and delayed healthcare services after
retirement. Delay in healthcare services is related to compliance with illness treatment, and unique
preventive healthcare needs to avoid further health complications. A major goal of the behavioral model is
to understand the characteristics of an individual's access to healthcare. Second, research conducted in this
study will offer insight into different health insurance coverage regarding financing aspects: income, out-
of-pocket medical costs, Medicare and Medicaid. Furthermore, health insurance includes managed care
(HMO) and supplementary Medicare insurance. The public and private health insurance implications are
essential to improve the health of the population. Third, this study underscores an improvement in patient
trust, patient satisfaction, and effective communication with healthcare providers. In addition, it will lead
to a healthier population and decrease unmet needs and delayed care. This will improve the efficiency
of delivering healthcare. Clearly this notion is what underlies the broad public uneasiness concerning
the health of the population, such as the quality of life as indicated by the absence of access disparity, and
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1748
also restrain in the rise of medical expenditures under the current complex healthcare system in
the United States.
2. Brief Background
2.1. Medicare Benefits
Medicare benefits consist of two parts: hospital insurance plan, Part A and physician insurance plan,
Part B. A person with hospital insurance protection (Part A) may have benefits paid on his/her behalf or,
in certain cases, paid to him/her for covered healthcare services. Part B adds additional protection by
providing a basic hospital insurance plan and covering a substantial part of physician services in both
hospital and nonhospital settings that include an emergency room or outpatient clinic, including
same-day surgery, ambulance services, and clinical laboratory. Parts A and B are provided automatically
to a person aged 65 or over who is entitled to Social Security Retirement Benefits. The Medicare Part A
is financed primarily through a mandatory payroll deduction. Part B is financed through premium
payments and contributions from the general fund of the U.S. Treasury.
Beginning in 2006, an additional plan, Part D, has provided subsidized access to prescription drugs
insurance coverage. Part D is financed primarily through premium payments and contributions from the
Treasury general fund. Part D works differently from Medicare Part A and Part B, beginning with the
fact that Part D is an optional plan. However, those eligible need to choose among plans offered by
health insurance providers or other companies approved by Medicare. Any person who enrolls in
either Medicare Part A or Medicare Part B is eligible to enroll in a Medicare Part D part. If qualified
individuals do not enroll in a plan when they first become eligible for Medicare, they might be subject
to a Medicare-imposed late enrollment penalty.
2.2. Supplemental Insurance for the Elderly
There are many types of private health insurance coverage that the elderly can purchase in order to
fill the gaps that are not covered by Medicare. These types of private health insurance/coverage include:
employee or retiree coverage from employers and Medigap insurance from private insurance companies.
The supplemental insurance pays for parts or all of healthcare costs [15]. These types of private health
insurance coverage are known as "supplemental insurance", "Medicare Supplemental" or "Medigap"
insurance is a specific type of private insurance that is subject to federal and state laws. Medicare
supplemental insurance policies are sold by private insurance companies to Medicare beneficiaries in
order to fill the "gaps" in the original Medicare coverage. There are ten standardized policies, labeled
Plan A through Plan J that work in conjunction with the original Medicare plan. Each state decides which
of the 10 policies can be sold in the state. Since Medicare does not cover all healthcare expenses,
Medicare supplemental insurance is only sold as supplemental health insurance for Medicare recipients.
Unlike Medicare, Medicare supplement insurance plan is not a federal program. However, health
insurance companies that provide Medicare supplemental insurance coverage are strictly regulated by
both the federal and state governments.

2.3. Disparity in Health and Accessibility
Improving health status is the central objective of policies designed in the United States today, as
emphasized in Healthy People 2020. One of the growing debates in health policy and strategy wages
over how to eliminate health disparities [16]. Policymakers often draw a distinction between access and
utilization of healthcare services. In particular, the use of healthcare services are discussed in terms of
the distribution of healthcare services according to needs of individuals, which brings up the issue of
horizontal and vertical equity [14,17足19].
Healthy People 2020 defines health disparity as the unequal burden in disease, morbidity and
mortality rates experienced by socioeconomic status, race, national origin, and language as compared to
the dominant group. There are many reasons for health disparities in the United States. These include
lack of access to affordable health insurance coverage, barriers to enrollment in public programs, and
patient-provider relation. In addition low health literacy, which is associated with poverty, limited
education, and lack of affordable health insurance, is another important factor.
Health disparities are affected by at least two important factors: first, the individual's ability to
produce or maintain their health [20,21] and second, the degree of accessibility of healthcare services
associated with unmet needs and delayed care. With regard to the second aspect, which is the main focus
of this study, unmet needs and delayed care depend on factors determined by an individual's choices as
well as choices that the individual cannot substantially influence [10,22]. Access to healthcare services,
such as the relationship between a patient and his or her healthcare provider, is an important factor that
affects individual health disparities [23]. Also, access costs in terms of financial and time costs are
factors that influence the amount of healthcare services used by the individual [1,24]. Like ease of access,
choosing to have private insurance cover costs of healthcare services is a controllable factor by the
individual but the choice of the public health system is not. Both types of health insurances influence the
degree of health disparity caused by unmet needs and delayed care. The accessibility of healthcare
services for an individual is defined as the availability of private and public health insurance [14,25],
ability to procure and use knowledge [26], and other socio-economic and demographic characteristics
of the individual [11,27]. The differences in these factors widen the disparity in health among children
under the current U.S. healthcare system.
The questions posed in this study are: (1) Do public health programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid,
play an effective role in reducing unmet needs and delayed care? (2) How important is the difference of
income disparity and out-of-pocket costs in determining the choices made in unmet needs and delayed
care situations? (3) What are the influences of predisposing factors such as education, patient trust,
patient satisfaction, and patient-provider communication on unmet needs and delayed care? In the
remainder of this study, we will strive to provide answers and insights to these inquiries. Section 2
presents the methodology: primary data source, and dependent variables regarding measures of unmet
needs and delayed care. The empirical framework includes theoretical based explanations for enabling,
reinforcing, and predisposing behavioral factors to evaluate unmet needs and delayed care. In Section 3,
we present the empirical results, followed by the conclusion in Section 4.

3. Method
3.1. Primary Data Source
We used data from the 2003足2004 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Household Survey. The data
collection started in February 2003 and was completed in February 2004. The Household Survey
contains information from approximately 46,587 individuals in 25,419 families. The individuals ages 16
and older, and represents the national civilian, non-institutionalized population who live in the United
States. Non-institutionalized population are individuals who are not in a institution (criminal, mental, or
other types of facilities) or an active duty military personnel. The sample is clustered in 60 CTS sites:
51 metropolitan areas and nine nonmetropolitan areas, which were randomly selected to form the core
CTS and to be representative of the nation as a whole. The survey was administered by telephone, using
computer-assisted telephone interviewing technology. Majority of respondents were selected through
list-assisted random-digit-dialing. The CTS Household Survey is the last data with a large sample
population and was replaced by the Health Tracking Household Survey (HTHS) with the sample size of
17,797 (16,671) individuals in 9407 (9165) families in 2007 (2010). Both 2007 and 2011 HTHSs focuses
on only 12 metropolitan areas unlike, the CTS Household Survey 2003足2004: 51 metropolitan areas and
9 nonmetropolitan areas. The CTS Household Survey 2006 was created before the Medicare prescription
program started in 2006. This study reveals the relationship between unmet prescription drugs, perceived
delay in healthcare, and unmet needed healthcare. In addition, it evaluates the effect of unmet
prescription drug on health before the Medicare prescription program.
The Household Survey instruments covered a large variety of topics including: health insurance, use
of health services, and satisfaction with care, health status, and certain demographic information.
A family informant provided information on insurance coverage, health resource use, usual source of
care, and the general health status of all family members. The informant also provided information on
family income, employment, earnings, employer-offered insurance plan, and race/ethnicity of all adult
family members. Each adult in the family answered questions from a self-response module that covered
the issues of unmet needs, patient trust, satisfaction with physician choice, risky behaviors such as
smoking, and the last visit to a doctor.
3.2. Dependent Variables: Measures of Delayed Healthcare and Unmet Needs
In this study, healthcare accessibility is divided into two dimensions: the general perceived delayed
healthcare and unmet healthcare needs. Capturing generally perceived delayed healthcare, the survey
included the question, "Was there any time during the past 12 months when you put off or postponed
getting medical care you though you needed?" This study then evaluated the different influences of
enabling, predisposing, and reinforcing factors on this perceived delay in care. The question about
generally perceived unmet needs was "During the past 12 months, was there any time when you didn't
receive the medical care you needed?" However, the information does not provide any information on
specific illnesses or conditions. The respondent either recognizes the existence of a health problem or
perceives needed care sometime in the near future. The same survey item is used to measure unmet
needs [10]. If the response is "yes," this implies that the person did not get the medical care that he or
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1751
she needed (see Table 1 and Figure 1). It is measured by patient perceptions of disability, symptom, and
diagnoses [28].
Table 1. Definitions and Characteristics of Delayed Healthcare, and Unmet Needed
Healthcare (aged 65 and over).

Tracking Study Household Survey, United States. The SRM for specific symptoms are 7 specific symptoms
for the serious category that are potentially life threatening if not treated, and 8 specific symptoms for the
morbid category that is not life threatening but can potentially have considerable impact on quality of life.

It is crucial to understand that unmet healthcare and delayed care needs are different concepts [9].
In our analysis, four dimensions of healthcare components were evaluated: generally perceived unmet
needs, generally perceived delayed healthcare, actual unmet needs, and evaluated delayed healthcare.
For generally perceived delayed care, the logical expectation is that self-perceived delayed care at least
once in the past twelve months is experienced by putting off the care as displayed in Table 1 and Figure 1.
For actual delayed care, a respondent did not receive care after the new occurrence of a specific
symptom. Evaluated delayed care is closely related to the kind and amount of treatment that will be
provided after a respondent has presented to a medical provider [22,28] as shown in Table 1. The
respondent has postponed receiving treatment from a specialist after obtaining a referral from a regular
doctor, put off taking a test in spite of the doctor's recommendation, or deferred having a
procedure/surgery in spite of a doctor's orders. Thus, the evaluated delayed care possibly captures some
aspect of adherence. The dimension represents the evaluated side of needs, focusing more on
professional assessment of symptoms and diagnoses [28].
3.3. Empirical Framework: PP Model
The line of research on health behavior and its policy implications originated from the
PRECEDE-PROCEED model (PP model) [29足31]. This offers some concepts and analytical tools to
help analyze access disparity and health inequality by using the U.S. Household Survey of the
Community Tracking Study. The study applies the PP model to evaluate behavioral characteristics for
delayed care, unmet needs, and health inequality between Phases 2 and 4 (Figure 2). Phases 1足5 show
the assessment of the PP model in Figure 2. The focus of this study is to assess three categories of
influential behavioral factors (enabling, predisposing, and reinforcing factors) by controlling
socio-demographic factors in Phase 4 and by evaluating their behavioral influences on delayed care and
unmet needs in Phase 3. Phase 5, the policy assessment section, represents the assessment of health
promotion, and government policy and regulation on healthcare financing and delivery.
Individual delayed healthcare and unmet needs healthcare can be attributed to the quantity and quality
of physical and environmental domains, which can affect health inequality, as well as quality of life.
Enabling factors include: access to healthcare services, availability of recourses, and referrals to
appropriate healthcare providers, for example income, healthcare financing (out-of-pocket healthcare
costs, Medicare HMO, Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance, and Medicaid), and available
methods of healthcare services [30]. Predisposing factors encourage active traits and include:
educational level, knowledge, attitude, beliefs, perception, values, culture, etc. Attributable to
knowledge by higher education, health illiteracy and skills in health information seeking, individuals
know how to evaluate quality of health and healthcare [30]. Reinforcing factors are comprised of the
different types of feedback, such as the rewards of a particular behavior change made by those in the
target population, for example family, marital status, friend, teachers, etc [30].
The PP model offers some concepts and analytical tools that help analyze policy influences on
behavioral decisions (see bottom of Figure 2) by using influential factors in Phase 4 within the
framework of the PP model. This study assumes that delayed care and unmet needs are measurable as a
flow per unit of time because delayed care and unmet needs encompass heterogeneous needs, such as
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1753
routine, preventative physician care, specialty physician services, acute care, dental care, mental care,
and health educational services.
Note: See the adaptation of a model by Green and Kreuter [30].
Figure 2. Application of PRECEDE-PROCEED Model to examine generally perceived
delay in health care and generally perceived unmet needed health care.
The study assumes that the health inequality in Phase 2 (Figure 2) is attributed to healthcare service
use behavior based on his or her delayed care (DELAY) and unmet needs (UNMET) in Phase 3. This is
influenced by socio-demographic factors, as well as predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling factors in
Phase 4. Individuals with delayed care and unmet needs are evaluated. A functional behavioral model in
Phases 3 and 4 could be expressed as follows:
= ( , , , ) + , (1)
= ( , , , ) + , (2)
Equations (1) and (2) represent the relationship between the health behavioral choice of individual
"i" and a person with delayed care and unmet needs in Phases 3 in Figure 2. Factors will influence an
individual's delayed care, and DELAY is an unobserved error, generally assumed to satisfy E(DELAY|
EN, PR, RE, SD) = 0. UNMET is an unobserved error, generally assumed to satisfy E(UNMET| EN,
PR, RE, SD) = 0.
Both delayed healthcare (DELAY) and unmet healthcare needs (UNMET) consist of enabling (EN),
predisposing (PR), reinforcing (RE), and socio-demographic factors (SD) that will influence healthcare
disparity of the elderly. The study incorporates the extended PP Model to observe health inequality and
the influential determinants.

In our estimation, enabling factors include income, health insurance related aspects, price of
healthcare expenditures (out-of-pocket expenditures), usual source of care, and time related accessibility
measures. This study analyzes a variety of health insurance aspects to fill the gap in literature. In order
to capture coverage and managed care cost saving aspects, this study includes Medicare HMO, private
health insurance with HMO, and Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance [25,32,33]. In addition to
the price of healthcare services, an individual's income level affects the living standard which contributes
to unmet needs and delayed care and, in turn, health outcome [34]. Low income, minority populations
received less healthcare than the wealthier population, who has a higher probability of obtaining
healthcare when they need it [35]. Various components, as well as the amount of time invested in health
services by using usual source of care and time input for accessibility to healthcare services, also
influences an individual's health status through enabling factors as seen in Table 1 [21].
Predisposing factors are education as a substitute for knowledge, patient trust, patient satisfaction,
patient-provider communication, and lifestyle risk. The educational level as knowledge is associated
with unmet needs and delayed care. Higher education levels affect health capital development and
increase efficiency in health status. Years of education represent health capital related to health knowledge,
allowing individuals to make better behavioral decisions, which is related to educational attainment [36].
Another barrier to obtaining needed care without delay may be lack of knowledge of the importance of
seeing a referred specialist, of getting the recommended test, or receiving proper procedure [37].
There has been a dramatic increase in the interest of measuring patients' trust in their physicians.
Trust is a defining element in any interpersonal relationship and it is particularly central to the
patient-provider relationship [38]. Any consideration of the patients' interpersonal trust in physicians
must take into account the general atmosphere in healthcare institutions. Although evidence shows that
the majority of patients continue to trust their physicians and health information, concern is growing
over the rapid and far-reaching changes in the healthcare system, which have placed great pressure on
that trust and may undermine it [39]. The new concerns about patient trust has triggered a recognition
that there needs to be a better understanding of the role of trust in a patient-physician relationship and
health information, and the relationship between trust and health outcomes.
An increasingly important role in the provision of clinical process and outcomes are related to patient
satisfaction through service improvements in nursing homes, hospitals, and clinics. The scope of patient
satisfaction includes physician's inpatient care, primary care services, patient-perceived nurse care,
waiting time for services at clinics, etc. [40]. Patient satisfaction not only depends on services from
healthcare providers but also varies by anxiety level of patient, mental status of patient, and geographic
correlation with physician [41,42].
The relationship between patients and their physicians is influenced by lack of cultural competence
of physicians to improve communication with patients, lack of knowledge about procedural issues,
inconsistencies of recommendation guidelines to patients, lack of physicians' encouragement of patients'
interest, lack of evidence for benefit from patients' health insurance coverage, and failure to call back
patients for screening. These are all barriers that stem, in part, from the communication between patients
and physicians [43,44], and inevitably hinder a patient's incentive to decrease unmet needs and delayed
care. Thus efforts to improve unmet/met needs and delayed care should focus at least in part on
improving patient-provider communication. The possible role of health communication between patients
and physicians with unmet/met needs and delayed care has recently received greater attention. Health
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1755
communication is the art and technique of informing, influencing, and motivating individual,
institutional, and public audiences about important health issues. Quality oriented communication
between patients and their physicians is related to patients' awareness of unmet needs and delayed care.
A lack of communication between a patient and a healthcare provider can lead to serious problems (e.g.,
chance of survival).
In socio-demographic factors, behavioral aspects of choosing unmet/met needs and delayed care in
relation to maintaining good health, use healthcare services which vary by the factors that include age,
gender, race/ethnicity, and poverty level. In socio-demographic factors, an individual's health status
based on subjective health is included in a base specification without making a health index because of
the lack of ADL objective measurements [45,46]. Estimation is an alternative specification without a
health status variable. An underlying factor in the discussion above implies that the estimated coefficient
on unmet needs and delayed care would be an upward biased estimate of the true impact of these
variables, assuming that individual health status variables are omitted. The results would be biased.
4. Results
4.1. Reliability of Estimation
For this empirical study, there are three issues of reliability of estimation: exogeneity/endogeneity,
multicollinearity, and heteroskedasticity in probit estimation. Health status of the elderly is included in
a base specification and educational level, i.e., health knowledge. This is seen as a factor that improves
the efficiency with which the elderly can produce better health. The income level of the elderly affects
the living standard, which contributes to the health of elderly. In addition, the correlation of educational
attainment and income is generally positive. An elderly person with a higher education level is more
likely to raise health stock because of his/her health knowledge. Both variables are theoretically
important to evaluate the elderly with delayed healthcare services and unmet healthcare needs.
Therefore, there are multiple included endogenous variables in this empirical study.
Regarding the issue of exogenity/endogeneity, the study used the Hausman Specification Test to
examine the endogeneity of this empirical model, and to examine delayed care, unmet needs, and health
variables. Under the null hypothesis, there is no simultaneity and correlation between, health variable
and DELAY
i which an error term of DELAY Equation (1), and health variable and UNMET
i which is an
error term of UNMET Equation (2) should be zero, asymptotically. The residual of health is included in
the structural form. The study used two instrument variables, body mass index (BMI) and subjective
mental health in Table 2. Two of the residuals in the structural equation were not found to be statistically

Notes: a: The symptom response module (SRM) was included in the Community Tracking Study Household
Survey: United States. The SRM for specific symptoms are 7 specific symptoms for the serious category that
are potentially life threatening if not treated, and 8 specific symptoms for the morbid category that is not life
threatening but potentially have considerable impact on quality of life. b: See Murata et al. [46].
The hypothesis that both the coefficient on the health status and the coefficient on education are zero
is an example of a joint hypothesis on the coefficients in the multiple regressions (1 and 2). The
regressors are possibly multicollinear and linear relationship among some or all-explanatory variables
of a regression model makes precise estimation difficult. The variance-inflation factor (vif) detects
multicollinearity by using condition indices. The variance-inflation factor (vif) for the general perceived
delayed healthcare range from 1.02 to 2.28 in Table 3, that of general perceived unmet needed healthcare
ranges from 1.02 to 2.28 in Table 4; evaluated subjective health for the elderly of general perceived
delayed healthcare ranges from 1.02 to 2.30 in Table 5; and evaluated subjective health for the elderly of
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1759
general perceived unmet needed healthcare ranges from 1.02 to 2.30 in Table 6. All vifs are less than 10.
As a rule of thumb, when analyzing standardized data, a VIF < 10 indicates a non-harmful collinearity
[47足49].

All of the results reported in Tables 3足6 use heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors since increasing
variances of distribution for the estimators causes bias and affects efficiency of regression estimation,
especially a cross-sectional study with the large data. Therefore, heteroskedasticity does not threaten the
internal validity of the multiple regression analysis with the definition of variables in Table 2 by using
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1760
the process of heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. Evaluated subjective health status (ill health)
will lead to an increase in healthcare service utilization that is also related to a rise in healthcare
expenditures. Consequently, this leads to higher healthcare costs, financial problems, delayed healthcare
and unmet needs. The elderly with delayed and unmet needs for healthcare may cause health status to
weaken. The study of health behavior, by applying the extended PP Model, requires
exogeneity/endogeneity tests for delayed care and unmet needs with health variables.
To determine whether the items in each factor could be used for probit regression, dimensionality and
reliability (eigenvalue greater than one rule) and consistent estimate of reliability (Cronbach ): the
interrelated issues of dimensionality and reliability of responses to a scale, were performed.
In Tables 2足6, three items for patient distrust are referral, medical needs, and influence; those of patient
dissatisfaction are healthcare, primary care doctor, and specialist; and those of patient-provider
miscommunication includes the key items of listening, explaining, and difficulty with communication
or understanding. Using the item reduction method (i.e., factor analysis), the initial eigenvalues for all
three factors were greater than 1, and the eigenvalues dropped toward later components (from 1.453 to
0.864 for patient distrust, from 1.587 to 0.795 for patient dissatisfaction, and from 1.809 to 0.945
patient-provider miscommunication). This implies that there is a uni-dimension of these three factors.
To evaluate consistent estimate of reliability of the scale, Cronbach's coefficient alpha, based on
standardized items, was examined for each factor. Cronbach's coefficient alphas are items of patient
distrust ( = 0.453 with a poor estimate), items of patient dissatisfaction ( = 0.582 with a questionable
level), and items of patient-provider miscommunication ( = 0.667 with an acceptable estimate).
4.2. Regression Results: General Perceived Delayed Healthcare and Unmet Needed Healthcare
The results of regression for this study are: general perceived delayed healthcare (Table 3); general
perceived unmet needs (Table 4); evaluated subject health of the elderly of the general perceived delayed
healthcare (Table 5); and evaluated subject health of the elderly of the unmet needed healthcare (Table 6).
The summary statistics and definitions of the variables used in this study are listed in Table 2. The results
of these estimations show that the general perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet
needed healthcare are sensitive to unmet prescription drugs in Tables 3 and 4. The general perceived
delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare are more likely increase as an
increase in unmet prescription medicines by older adults aged 65 and over. The results show that an
increase in the price of drug and out-of-pocket costs imposes a financial burden on prescription drug use
of the elderly.
For enabling factors, as stated earlier, an increase in income is statistically significant and negatively
associated general perceived delayed healthcare and general perceived unmet needed healthcare in
Tables 3 and 4, while out-of-pocket medical costs have a higher probability of raising the general
perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needs. The aforementioned results reveal
that the financial burden of receiving healthcare services for those aged 65 and over would lead to the
general perceived delayed healthcare and the unmet needed healthcare.
Comparing healthcare financing the public programs, Medicare HMO, Medicare supplementary
medical insurance, and Medicaid indicates that there is no clear cut behavioral difference in regarding
the general perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. Table 4
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1761
shows that the Medicaid program is associated with an increased probability of the general perceived
unmet needed healthcare. According to the definition and the questionnaire about a term "put off
receiving healthcare care services" in the Community Tracking Study Household Survey 2003足2004,
the items on the general perceived delayed healthcare are attributable to patient side of reasons, not the
motives from the healthcare service provider.

For predisposing factors in Tables 3 and 4, we employ four measures to evaluate behavioral choice
for those aged 65 and over. Interestingly, both the variables of the general perceived delayed healthcare
and unmet needed healthcare are positively associated with patient distrust. The coefficients of patient
distrust which consist of referral issues, medical needs, and influence of health insurance firms on
physician's decision making for services are more likely to perceive delayed healthcare and unmet
needed healthcare. The results of the distrust variables point out some interesting aspects of the
behavioral decisions made by the elderly. In predisposing factors, an increase in patient dissatisfaction
with healthcare services, which consist of healthcare in general, a choice of primary care, and choice of
specialists, tends to raise generally perceived delayed healthcare and generally perceived unmet needed
healthcare. However, the coefficients of patient-provider communication, which consists of a
physician's attitude toward listening efforts, clear explanation about illness situation and treatment, and
undivided attention to communicate to the patients, do not show statistical significance and do not
present a clear cut association with delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare.
4.3. Regression Results: Evaluated Subject Health for General Perceived Delayed Healthcare and
Unmet Needed Healthcare
The results of Tables 5 and 6 report evaluated subject health, which is a composited scales of physical
and mental health status, of the general perceived delayed healthcare or the general perceived unmet
needed healthcare age 65 and over. The coefficient of general perceived delayed healthcare with a
positive sign in Table 5 shows that elderly persons, who face general perceived delayed healthcare,
reduce their health status by 48.8% within the composited health scale between 2 and 10 as compared to
elderly persons who do not have any problems of the general perceived delayed healthcare. The similar
interpretation is applied to the coefficient of general perceived unmet needed healthcare in Table 6 and
its effect is higher among elderly persons with general perceived unmet needed healthcare by 59.6%
than elderly persons without any problems of unmet needed healthcare.
The elderly persons who are not able to afford prescription medicine are strongly associated with
evaluated health status in both delayed and unmet needed healthcare. The elderly persons who do not
get needed prescription medicines are predicted to raise the health of the general perceived delayed
healthcare by 44.2% and general perceived unmet needed healthcare by 49.2% more than the elderly
persons who do not have those prescription problems. The large impact of the results imply that
prescription drug coverage by Medicare is an important factor that influences the health of the elderly
who face the general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare.
For healthcare financing factors in Tables 5 and 6, a negative sign of income variable indicates that
an increase in income of the elderly is associated with an increase in the health status of the elderly
among the elderly who face general perceived healthcare or unmet needed healthcare (see the definition
of factors in Table 2). A positive sign of poverty coefficients shows that an increase in poverty among
the elderly of general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare is associated with
reduction of their evaluated subjected health status. A rise in out-of-pocket medical costs within the
range between 1 and 6 is also associated with the deterioration of evaluated subject health of the elderly
who face general perceived delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare by an 18.2% and an 18.4%
respectively.
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2015, 12 1763
Regarding health insurance factors, coefficients of Medicare HMO indicate that the elderly under
Medicare HMO are associated with a 12.1% reduction of bad evaluated subjective health of the general
perceived delayed healthcare within the range between 2 and 10. Similarly, the Medicare HMO influence
on the evaluated subjective health of the elderly of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare is by
13.2%. Compared to fee-for-service of the traditional health insurance, the provision of preventive
characteristics by the HMO tends to raise better subjective health status of the elderly with general
perceived delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare. Furthermore, the positive signs indicate that
the elderly with the Medicaid insurance are more likely to have weak adherence to have good evaluated
subjective health.

For the influences of predisposing factors such as education, patient distrust, patient dissatisfaction,
and patient-provider miscommunication on the subjective health of the elderly of general perceived
delayed healthcare or unmet needed healthcare, both results in Tables 5 and 6 show quantitatively
comparable effects and consistent signs. A negative sign of education indicates a strong negative
influence of a rise in educational level on an increase in better subjective health. All patient distrust,
patient dissatisfaction, and patient-provider miscommunication are positive and raise both general
perceived delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare. The delayed and unmet needed care
deteriorate health of the elderly.
4.4. Concentration Curve: Access Disparity and Health Inequality
Figures 3 and 4 show the concentration curves which emphasizes and measures health inequalities
and identifies inequalities in health by using the concentration index. The index is negative when the
curve is above the equality line and positive when the curve is under the equality curve. The
concentration index is defined with reference to the concentration curve, which graphs on the x-axis the
cumulative percentage of the population ranked by income beginning with the lowest, and on the
y-axis the cumulative percentage of "general perceived delayed healthcare," "general perceived unmet
needed healthcare," or "unmet needed prescription drug," corresponding to each cumulative percentage
of the population of the income in Figure 3. Since all concentration indices take negative values in the
table of concentration index if there is access disparity, all concentration curves lies above the line of
equality, indicating disproportionate concentration of delayed care, unmet needs, or unmet prescription
are among the poor (low income) income population [50,51]. Figure 3 presents a concentration curve
for which the curve of unmet prescription is highest among three measures, and unmet prescription is
disproportionately large in the population among the poor. The degree to which unmet prescription,
delayed care, or unmet needs is more unequally distributed to the disadvantaged of low-income
population in the elderly. Access disparity of healthcare services exists among the low-income population.
For Figure 4, the values of "general perceived unmet needed healthcare" and "unmet prescription
drug" in the table concentration index for health inequality are positive and their concentration curves
lie below the line of equality. However, "delayed care" takes a negative value of the concentration index.
The sign indicates that the general perceived delay in healthcare rises as out-of-pocket increases among
the elderly. The unmet needed prescription drug is closer to the equality line than the general perceived
unmet healthcare needs and the degree of index of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare is
smaller than that of the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. The general perceived unmet needed
healthcare is disproportionately large in the population among the high out-of-pocket costs.

This empirical study concludes unmet needs of prescription drugs for the elderly population have
positive influence on the perceived delay in healthcare and perceived unmet needed healthcare. These
factors are disproportionally large in the population among the poor (low income) elderly. These three
factors raise evaluated ill health status, ranging between 45%~60% among the elderly population. Other
interesting findings are that out-of-pocket medical costs elevate perceived unmet needed healthcare and
delayed healthcare, and the high out-of-pocket costs raise disproportionally large perceived unmet
needed healthcare for elderly population. Our findings also offer insight into the patient-physician
relation mechanism. Patient's distrust and dissatisfaction increase perceived unmet needed healthcare
and delay in healthcare. These two factors and patient-provider miscommunication together increase
subjective ill health status by about 26%. However, educational attainment of one additional year reduces
subjective ill health status by 7%.

Policy makers need to address a diverse amount of issues to make the healthcare more affordable and
accessible to reduce inequality of healthcare burden, which in turn lead to health disparity, under the
current system. This research reinforces and extends the findings of a previous study for issues
concerning health insurance, race, income and satisfaction [9]; and for health insurance and race related
aspects [10]. Unlike the results by Mollborn et al., [9] for educational variable, our study supports a
hypothesis of educational attainment with better health status for the population aged 65 and over. This
study is different since it focuses on understanding the behavioral choices and characteristics of the
elderly population aged 65 years and over. In order to underline a more specific policy implication, the
behavioral model (the PRECEDE-PROCEED model) was used to comprehend some cognitive aspects,
and provide a detailed construction of unmet needs and delayed healthcare. Most importantly, we
included a prescription variable that previous studies did not employ.
Our findings show a dimension of increase costs of prescription drug for the elderly in the general
perceived delayed healthcare and the elderly in general perceived unmet needs. The results of our study
clearly show some important aspects of referral issue and medical needs in distrust category for general

perceived delayed healthcare and the general perceived unmet needed healthcare. Our detailed patient
satisfaction variables support the result of a single trust variable [9]. In addition, we employed mode
detail dissatisfaction measures; composite points by satisfaction with healthcare services, satisfaction
with a choice of primary care, and satisfaction with choice of specialists, and underlined the significance
of behavioral aspects that the previous study by using a single satisfaction measure [9]. Our results are
congruent with the result by Hispanic and African American behavior of unmet needs and delayed
healthcare [10]. It is known that economic/financial aspects are debilitating factors for the elderly
population falling in the group of delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare as a regular source of
care. In other words it implies, income and out-of-pocket medical costs are associated with the two
characteristics. The income factor is inversely associated with access disparity and health inequality,
whereas, the out-of-pocket medical cost has a positive association, or a direct association, with the access
disparity and health inequality. Our study shows that lack of financial source of care is associated with
an increase in unequally distributed services to the disadvantaged of population of the elderly. The
variable of education does not show a clear-cut importance of healthcare knowledge, which is relevant
to Grossman's argument [21].
What is the practical implication of our findings? The government's Medicaid health insurance is
limited to consumer medical care choice that is adversely associated with health and healthcare equality
in accordance with our finding from generally perceived unmet needs. An increase in subjective health
status with a variable of Medicare HMO partially explains the preventive care aspect to receive
meaningful healthcare services in consistent with subjective health of the elderly of the general perceived
delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare from our finding. Most importantly, medicine
prescriptions are a well-known fact and the elderly take multi-prescription to prevent a decrease in health
capital from aging. The data for this study is from the Community Tracking Study Household Survey
2003足2004 that was taken before the Medicare prescription program started in 2006. Although the
current Medicare prescription program is not ideal one, we still need to do research about the influence
of the current Medicare prescription program on the elderly population. When assessing Medicare
insurance coverage disparities in access based on unmet needs and delayed healthcare, there is little
evidence the effectiveness of policy and healthcare and health disparity among disadvantaged
population.
It is not difficult to explain why two of three measures produced the same results of positive influence
of patient distrust and dissatisfaction on health of the elderly of the general perceived delayed healthcare
and unmet needed healthcare. A recent rapid increase in medical costs associated with an increase in
access disparity causes health disparity among the elderly. Further study is strongly recommended to
understand and to comprehend characteristic different behavioral choice about delayed healthcare and
unmet needed healthcare for reducing health disparity, especially unequally distributed disadvantaged
of income population in the elderly and delayed healthcare and unmet needed healthcare for decreasing
disproportionately large in the elderly among the high out-pocket costs.

1: The concentration index is computed on individual (micro) data. The concentration index is
computed as [50,51]: CI = 2cov(hi
, Ri
)/, where hi
is the individual i's indicator variable (e.g., health
status) whose inequality is measured,  is its mean, and Ri
is the ith
individual's fractional rank in the
socioeconomic distribution (e.g., the person's rank in the income distribution). "cov" is the covariance.
Standard errors of CI are obtained by a covariance/formula method:
var(CI) = (1/n)[(1/n)i = 1
ai
2 - (1 + CI)2], where a = (hi
/)(2Ri
- 1 - CI) + 2 - qi-1
