DIABETIC KIDNEY DISEASE
(DKD) is a common and
morbid complication of dia-
betes and the leading cause
of chronic kidney disease in the devel-
oped world. Approximately 40% of per-
sons with diabetes develop DKD, mani-
fested as albuminuria, impaired
glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or
both.1-4 Even mild degrees of albumin-
uria and decrease in GFR are associ-
ated with markedly increased risks of
cardiovascular disease and death and
higher health care costs.5-7 In addi-
tion, DKD accounts for nearly half of
all incident cases of end-stage renal dis-
ease (ESRD) in the United States.7 Five-
year survival for patients with ESRD is
less than 40%; Medicare spending on
the US ESRD program reached $26.8
billion in 2008.7 Therefore, preven-
tion of DKD is important to improve
health outcomes of persons with dia-
betes and to reduce the societal bur-
den of chronic kidney disease.
Two population trends could
strongly influence DKD prevalence over
time. First, the expanding size of the
diabetespopulationcouldincreaseDKD
prevalence. Second, widespread appli-
cation of diabetes therapies could re-
duce DKD prevalence. From 1988 to
2006, the prevalence of diabetes among
US adults aged 20 years or older in-
creased from 7.4% to 9.6%.8 Concur-
rently, clinical trials demonstrated that
lowering blood glucose levels reduced
the risk of developing albuminuria and
other microvascular diabetes compli-
cations9-11 and inhibitors of the renin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)

Context Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney disease in the developed world. Over
time, the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) may increase due to the ex-
panding size of the diabetes population or decrease due to the implementation of dia-
betes therapies.
Objective To define temporal changes in DKD prevalence in the United States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analyses of the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) from 1988-1994 (N=15 073),
NHANES 1999-2004 (N=13 045), and NHANES 2005-2008 (N=9588). Participants
with diabetes were defined by levels of hemoglobin A1c
of 6.5% or greater, use of
glucose-lowering medications, or both (n=1431 in NHANES III; n=1443 in NHANES
1999-2004; n=1280 in NHANES 2005-2008).
Main Outcome Measures Diabetic kidney disease was defined as diabetes with
albuminuria (ratio of urine albumin to creatinine 30 mg/g), impaired glomerular fil-
tration rate (60 mL/min/1.73 m2 estimated using the Chronic Kidney Disease Epi-
demiology Collaboration formula), or both. Prevalence of albuminuria was adjusted
to estimate persistent albuminuria.
Results The prevalence of DKD in the US population was 2.2% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.8%-2.6%) in NHANES III, 2.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-3.1%) in NHANES
1999-2004, and 3.3% (95% CI, 2.8%-3.7%) in NHANES 2005-2008 (P.001 for
trend). The prevalence of DKD increased in direct proportion to the prevalence of dia-
betes, without a change in the prevalence of DKD among those with diabetes. Among
persons with diabetes, use of glucose-lowering medications increased from 56.2% (95%
CI, 52.1%-60.4%) in NHANES III to 74.2% (95% CI, 70.4%-78.0%) in NHANES 2005-
2008 (P.001); use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors increased from
11.2% (95% CI, 9.0%-13.4%) to 40.6% (95% CI, 37.2%-43.9%), respectively
(P.001); the prevalence of impaired glomerular filtration rate increased from 14.9%
(95% CI, 12.1%-17.8%) to 17.7% (95% CI, 15.2%-20.2%), respectively (P=.03);
and the prevalence of albuminuria decreased from 27.3% (95% CI, 22.0%-32.7%)
to 23.7% (95% CI, 19.3%-28.0%), respectively, but this was not statistically signifi-
cant (P=.07).
Conclusions Prevalence of DKD in the United States increased from 1988 to
2008 in proportion to the prevalence of diabetes. Among persons with diabetes,
prevalence of DKD was stable despite increased use of glucose-lowering medica-
tions and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.

progressive decrease in GFR,12-15 lead-
ing to changes in the standards of care.1,2
In this study, we investigate trends
in the prevalence of DKD in the United
States over the past 2 decades and ex-
amine changes in disease manifesta-
tions among persons with diabetes.
METHODS
Study Population
The population-based National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) is a program of studies con-
ductedbytheNationalCenterforHealth
Statistics to evaluate the health of non-
institutionalized adults and children in
the United States.16 The Third NHANES
(NHANES III) took place from 1988-
1994. Starting in 1999, NHANES be-
came a continuous program with data
compiled in 2-year blocks.
Health examinations including
physical measurements and blood and
urine collections are conducted in a mo-
bile examination center. Each NHANES
oversamples persons of black race, His-
panic ethnicity, or both. The current
study includes participants in NHANES
III, NHANES 1999-2004, and NHANES
2005-2008 who were aged 20 years or
older, underwent a health examina-
tion in the NHANES mobile examina-
tion center, and had available data for
medication use, levels of hemoglobin
A1c
, serum creatinine concentrations,
and urine albumin and creatinine
concentrations.
All NHANES protocols were ap-
proved by the National Center for
Health Statistics Research ethics re-
view board (previously known as the
NHANES institutional review board);
all participants provided written in-
formed consent.16
Diabetes Definition
Diabetes was defined as use of glucose-
lowering medications (insulin or oral
hypoglycemic medications), level of he-
moglobin A1c
of 6.5% or greater, or
both.2,8 Level of hemoglobin A1c
of 6.5%
or greater was recently recommended
for diagnosis of diabetes by a broadly
representativeinternationalexpertcom-
mittee and by the American Diabetes
Association and is used in this study in-
stead of fasting or postchallenge glu-
cose to include NHANES participants
who were not fasting or did not re-
ceive an oral glucose tolerance test.2,17
Level of hemoglobin A1c
was mea-
sured during all of the NHANES cycles
using high-pressure liquid chromatog-
raphy (coefficients of variation
3.0%).16 Values in NHANES III and
NHANES 1999-2004 were standard-
ized to the Diabetes Control and Com-
plications Trial laboratory. To ac-
count for change in hemoglobin A1c
assay location and platform, hemoglo-
bin A1c
values from NHANES 2005-
2008 were calibrated to values from ear-
lier NHANES cycles using the equation:
Y=0.48920.9277X.8,16 We did not
use self-reported history of diabetes to
define diabetes to avoid bias by tem-
poral changes in diabetes case defini-
tion and ascertainment.
DKD Definition
Diabetic kidney disease was defined as
diabetes with the presence of albumin-
uria, impaired GFR, or both.1,2 In each
NHANES cycle, urine albumin and cre-
atinine concentrations were measured
in a random single-voided urine sample
using a solid-phase fluorescent immu-
noassay and a Jaffe rate reaction, re-
spectively. The ratio of urine albumin
to creatinine was expressed in milli-
grams per gram with albuminuria de-
fined as a level of 30 mg/g or greater.1,2
Albuminuria is well-known to have
substantial biological (intraindi-
vidual) variation, and current guide-
lines recommend that only persistent
albuminuria be considered evidence of
DKD.1,2 Therefore, we used data from
45 participants with diabetes in
NHANES III, ratio of urine albumin to
creatinine of 30 mg/g or greater at their
main examination, and a repeat urine
sample approximately 2 weeks later to
estimate the prevalence of persistent al-
buminuria from a single urine sample.16
Of these 45 participants, 35 had per-
sistent albuminuria (78%).
Serum creatinine concentrations
were measured using the kinetic Jaffe
rate method. Values from NHANES III
and NHANES 1999-2000 were cali-
brated as previously described to ac-
count for laboratory drift in serum cre-
atinine concentrations across NHANES
cycles.16,18-20 The GFR was estimated
from calibrated serum creatinine con-
centrations using the Chronic Kidney
Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
equation.21 Impaired GFR was defined
as less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2.1
Other Clinical Characteristics
Age, sex, race/ethnicity, and duration
of diabetes were assessed by question-
naire.16 Type 1 diabetes was defined for
descriptive purposes only using the fol-
lowing criteria: (1) diagnosis prior to
age 30 years; (2) first insulin use within
2 years of diabetes diagnosis (allow-
ing for reporting error); and (3) cur-
rent insulin use. Medications taken dur-
ing a 1-month period preceding the
NHANES physical examination were
assessed by in-person interview.16 Body
mass index was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Three or more consecutive
blood pressure measurements sepa-
rated by 30 seconds were made after 5
minutes of rest, with mean values used
for analysis.
Statistical Methods
All statistical analyses were per-
formed using Stata version 11.1 (Stata-
Corp, College Station, Texas) and in-
corporated recommended NHANES
weights to account for nonresponse bias
and sampling.16 For each of NHANES
III, NHANES 1999-2004, and NHANES
2005-2008, we determined the preva-
lence of DKD in the US population and
the distributions of clinical character-
istics among the diabetes subpopula-
tion using Stata's svy commands.
Diabetic kidney disease was evalu-
ated in 4 mutually exclusive catego-
ries based on the presence or absence
of albuminuria and impaired GFR. To
estimate the prevalence of persistent al-
buminuria (78% of persons with ratio
of urine albumin to creatinine 30 mg/
g), 22% of participants with albumin-
uria alone were reclassified as having

no DKD and 22% of participants with
albuminuria and impaired GFR were re-
classified as having only impaired GFR.
WealsoevaluatedimpairedGFR,per-
sistent albuminuria, and any DKD as
parallel outcomes. To estimate persis-
tent albuminuria, we multiplied the
prevalence of elevated ratio of urine al-
bumin to creatinine by the estimated
probabilityofpersistence(0.78)andcal-
culated corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) for the product.22 We es-
timated prevalence of any DKD as the
sum of (1) the prevalence of impaired
GFR and (2) the prevalence of normal
GFR and elevated ratio of urine albu-

lytical expression for the variance of any
DKD prevalence using statistical re-
sults provided by Goodman.22
Binomial regression using a log link
was used to estimate prevalence ratios
and to test trends in DKD prevalence
over time.23 NHANES III, NHANES
1999-2004, and NHANES 2005-2008
were modeled primarily as nonor-
dered independent variables. Tests for
trend were performed using a continu-
ous variable defined by the midpoint of
each study period (in years).
In models examining any DKD as an
outcome,participantswithdiabetesand
albuminuria only were considered to
have an outcome value of 0.78, which
allowed for estimation of DKD preva-
lence ratios accounting for albumin-
uria misclassification. We used a mul-
tipleimputationapproachtoobtain95%

imputation analysis, we used a differ-
ent imputed persistence estimate
obtained from a bootstrap sample to
account for additional variability asso-
ciated with estimation of persistence.
The variance of the prevalence ratios
was estimated by combining between-
and within-imputation estimates.24
Models were adjusted for age (in cat-
egories), sex, and race/ethnicity. All hy-
pothesis testing was 2-sided and P val-
ues of less than .05 were considered
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Diabetes in the US Population
Of participants meeting our eligibility
criteria from NHANES III (N=15 073),
NHANES 1999-2004 (N=13 045), and
NHANES 2005-2008 (N=9588), there
were 1431, 1443, and 1280, respec-
tively, who had diabetes (TABLE 1). The
weighted national prevalence of diabe-
tes was 6.0% (95% CI, 5.3%-6.7%) in
NHANES III, 7.8% (95% CI, 7.1%-
8.5%) in NHANES 1999-2004, and
9.4% (95% CI, 8.5%-10.4%) in
NHANES 2005-2008.
DKD in the US Population
Prevalence of DKD in the US popula-
tion was 2.2% in 1988-1994, 2.8% in
1999-2004, and 3.3% in 2005-2008
(TABLE 2; unadjusted P.001 for
trend). The demographically adjusted
increase in DKD prevalence was 18%
from 1988-1994 to 1999-2004 and 34%
from 1988-1994 to 2005-2008 (P=.003
for trend).
Increases in DKD prevalence were
largest for persons aged 65 years or
older among whom DKD was most
common. The estimated numbers of
persons with DKD in the United
States at any given point in time
increased from 3.9 million (95% CI,
3.2-4.6 million) during 1988-1994 to
5.5 million (95% CI, 4.8-6.3 million)
during 1999-2004 to 6.9 million
(95% CI, 6.0-7.9 million) during
2005-2008 (FIGURE).
DKD Among Persons With
Diabetes in the US Population
Among persons with diabetes, mean
age, sex distribution, and the propor-
tion of persons with type 1 diabetes
were stable over the periods examined
(Table 1). Larger proportions of par-
ticipants described themselves as Mexi-
can American and reported receiving a
previous diagnosis of diabetes.
The proportion of persons with dia-
betes taking glucose-lowering medica-
tions increased from 56.2% (95% CI,
52.1%-60.4%) to 74.2% (95% CI,
70.4%-78.0%); mean hemoglobin A1c
values decreased from 8.1% to 7.3%
(Table 1; P.001 for trend). Use of
RAAS inhibitors increased from 11.2%
(95% CI, 9.0%-13.4%) to 40.6% (95%
CI, 37.2%-43.9%) and mean systolic
and diastolic blood pressures de-
creased from 136/76 mm Hg to 131/69
mm Hg (P.001 for trend for each
comparison). Use of lipid-lowering
medications (primarily statins), in-
creased from 8.9% (95% CI, 6.4%-
11.4%) to 50.2% (95% CI, 46.1%-
54.4%); mean low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels decreased from 137
mg/dL to 105 mg/dL (to convert to
mmol/L, multiply by 0.0259) (P.001
for trend for each comparison).

Among persons with diabetes, preva-
lence of any DKD was 36.4% in 1988-
1994, 35.2% in 1999-2004, and 34.5%
in 2005-2008 (Table 2). After adjust-
ment for demographic factors, this rep-
resented no appreciable change over
time (Table 2).
The prevalence of albuminuria (with
or without impaired GFR) decreased
from 27.3% in 1988-1994 to 24.9% in
1999-2004 to 23.7% in 2005-2008
(TABLE 3). After adjustment for demo-
graphic factors, the differences were not
statistically significant (Table 3). In a
subgroup analysis by age, the preva-
lence of albuminuria decreased only
among persons younger than 65 years.
The overall distribution of the ratio of
urine albumin to creatinine (continu-
ous variable) did not change apprecia-
bly (TABLE 4).
The prevalence of impaired GFR

creased from 14.9% in 1988-1994 to
16.7% in 1999-2004 to 17.7% in 2005-
2008, representing demographically ad-
justed increases in prevalence of 21%
from 1999-2004 vs 1988-1994 and 29%
from 2005-2008 vs 1988-1994 (P=.03

demographic variables, the mean esti-
mated GFR decreased by 3.9 mL/min/
1.73 m2 from 1988-1994 to 1999-
2004 and from 1999-2004 to 2005-
2008 (Table 4).
After adjustment for body mass in-
dex in addition to demographic fac-

0.78-1.04) for 1999-2004, and 0.84

impaired GFR (P=.02 for trend). Preva-
lence of DKD did not change over time
within any racial or ethnic group
(eTable at http://www.jama.com).
COMMENT
We observed over the past 2 decades
using national population-based data
that the prevalence of DKD in the
United States increased in direct pro-
portion to the prevalence of diabetes
itself. Among persons with diabetes,
use of glucose-lowering medications
and RAAS inhibitors increased mark-
edly but there was no change in
the prevalence of DKD. Specific clini-
cal manifestations of DKD shifted
with an increased prevalence of
impaired GFR.
The increasing prevalence of DKD
underscores its public health impact.
Diabetes is the most common cause
of chronic kidney disease, and DKD
is the most common cause of ESRD
in the United States. Absolute DKD
prevalence estimates generated
herein are conservative because the
hemoglobin A1c
-based diabetes defi-
nition we used defines a smaller dia-
betes population than glucose-based
definitions8; we estimated the preva-
lence of persistent albuminuria (as
opposed to intermittent albumin-
uria); and we used an updated GFR
estimating equation that defines a
lower prevalence of impaired GFR
than preceding equations.21 Nonethe-
less, temporal trends reported herein
suggest that DKD will continue to
drive the prevalence of chronic kid-
ney disease and ESRD for the fore-
seeable future.
Moreover, DKD carries with it
substantial morbidity and mortality.
Persons with diabetes are already at
high risk for cardiovascular disease,
and the additional development of
DKD markedly amplifies their risk
for cardiovascular disease and
death.5,6,25 Two recent studies com-

gest that virtually all excess mortality
risk occurs in conjunction with the
development of DKD.26,27 Mean
annual per-person cost of health care
for Medicare recipients with DKD is
$21 740 to $25 352.7
Among the diabetic population, use
of glucose-lowering medications, RAAS
inhibitors, and lipid-lowering medica-
tions increased markedly over the last
20 years, and intermediate therapeu-
tic targets (hemoglobin A1c
, blood pres-
sure, and low-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol) were substantially improved
but this did not translate to a de-
creased prevalence of DKD. Trends in
medication use reflect results of high-
quality clinical trials published during
this period in addition to epidemio-
logical and health services work fo-
cused on education and implementa-
tion.
TheDiabetesControlandComplica-
tionsTrialandtheUKProspectiveDia-
betesStudydemonstratedthattightglu-
cose control prevents the development
of albuminuria in types 1 and 2 diabe-
tes,respectively.9-11 However,tightglu-
cosecontrolhasnotbeenproventopre-
ventdecreaseinGFRinrandomizedcon-
trolled trials. RAAS inhibitors reduce
albuminuria, at least in part by hemo-
dynamiceffectsreducingintraglomeru-

on GFR are more complex, with short-
termreductionsinGFRmediatedbyhe-
modynamicchangesandlong-termpre-

attributable to attenuation of progres-
sive parenchymal injury.12-15
Thus, the suggestion of a trend to-
ward declining prevalence of albumin-
uria observed in this study, at least
among younger persons with diabe-
tes, may be a direct result of improved
glycemic control and RAAS inhibi-
tion. The increased prevalence of im-
paired GFR may be due to the hemo-
dynamic effects of the RAAS inhibitors,
including control of blood pressure to
lower levels. However, RAAS inhibi-
tors reduce GFR by approximately 4
mL/min/1.73 m2 in clinical trials with
high levels of adherence29 so that a 30%
increase in the prevalent use of RAAS
inhibitors is unlikely to fully account
for the 3.9 mL/min/1.73 m2 decrease in
estimated GFR observed herein. There-
fore, it also is possible that implemen-
tation of diabetes treatments requires
more time to demonstrate benefit, or
that current diabetes therapies are fail-
ing to prevent decrease in GFR when
applied on the population level.
Notably, most therapies targeting
DKD have been developed while focus-
ing on albuminuria reduction, poten-
tially selecting for interventions that re-
duce albuminuria more than they
preserve GFR.30 Our results suggest that
additional interventions are needed to
prevent the development of diabetes
and to target GFR loss once diabetes is
diagnosed.
Characteristics of the diabetes popu-
lation also may have changed in a man-

ner that predisposes to DKD. Stable age
and sex distributions in the diabetes
population and multivariable model-
ing demonstrated that lack of decline
in DKD prevalence is not due to demo-
graphic changes. Self-reported dura-
tion of diabetes increased over time, and
longer disease duration could counter-
balance concurrent changes favoring
reduced DKD prevalence. Because dia-
betes diagnostic criteria and ascertain-
ment changed during the study pe-
riod,thispossibilitycannotbeexcluded.
The diabetic population became more
obese over the study period, and obe-
sity is known to increase the risks of de-
veloping albuminuria and impaired
GFR.31-33 However, prevalence of DKD
was stable, accounting for changes in
body mass index.
Diabetic kidney disease was ini-
tially characterized as a disease mani-
festing as albuminuria followed by de-
crease in GFR.34-36 However, a number
of studies demonstrated that impaired
GFR can occur without substantial al-
buminuria and that DKD can manifest
solely as impaired GFR.37-41 Our study
suggests that the clinical pattern of DKD
may be shifting over time, with more
impaired GFR and the possibility of de-
creased albuminuria, which could be
due to changes in diabetes treatment.
Renal pathology underlying this shift
and long-term implications of this shift
on cardiovascular complications and
ESRD remain to be determined. The in-
creasingly frequent manifestation of im-
paired GFR (at least relative to albu-
minuria) supports current guidelines
recommending screening for GFR in
addition to albuminuria.1,2
Strengths of this study include the
use of data with broad external valid-
ity, assessment of temporal trends over
20 years during which diabetes treat-
ment changed substantially, examina-
tion of complementary albuminuria and
GFR manifestations of DKD, and use
of conservative and temporally unbi-
ased definitions of diabetes and DKD.
This study also has limitations.
NHANES does not include institu-
tionalized persons, and persons who
are ill with advanced DKD may be
underrepresented. Despite careful
effects to minimize assay drift, this
may still affect the study results. Spe-
cifically, mean serum creatinine con-
centration was noted to increase over
time among young, healthy NHANES
participants (different participants at
each cycle), suggesting that a subtle
artificial decline in mean estimated
GFR may persist despite calibration;
measurement of urine albumin and
creatinine also is not standardized.20
Absolute estimates of persistent albu-
minuria prevalence were based in
part on repeat measurements in a
small group of NHANES III partici-
pants. This introduces uncertainty in
albuminuria prevalence estimates (as
reflected in the reported 95% CIs)
but probably does not bias the analy-
sis of temporal trends.
In conclusion, DKD has become
more prevalent in the US population
over the last 2 decades and will likely
contribute increasingly to health care
costs and mortality. Among persons
with diabetes, clinical manifestations
of DKD shifted to include more
impaired GFR but the prevalence of
any DKD did not change despite
increased use of diabetes-related
medications.
