Abstract
Background: Increasing evidence suggests a role for mineral metabolism in cardiovascular disease risk. 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium may be directly associated with cardiovascular risk factors or mediated
by each other.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We combined data for adult participants in three cycles of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (2001­2, 2003­4, 2005­6), a representative sample of the civilian, non-institutionalized US
population (N = 3,958). Using this data we examined joint associations of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with a range of
cardiovascular risk factors. 25(OH)D was inversely associated with fasting insulin (mean difference in insulin per 1 standard
deviation 25(OH)D: 20.053 (95%CI: 20.091, 20.015)), glucose (20.046 95%CI: 20.081, 20.012) and systolic blood pressure
(SBP) (20.032 95%CI: 20.062, 20.001), and positively associated with high density lipoprotein cholesterol HDL-c (0.088
95%CI: 0.044, 0.148), after adjustment for ethnicity, smoking, socio-economic status and waist circumference. PTH was
positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (0.110, 95%CI: 0.055, 0.164) in confounder adjusted models, but was not
associated with other cardiovascular risk factors. Albumin adjusted calcium was associated with triglycerides (0.102 95%CI:
0.063, 0.141), postload glucose (0.078, 95%CI: 0.025, 0.130), fasting insulin (0.074, 95%CI: 0.044, 0.104), HbA1c (0.070, 95%CI:
0.036, 0.105), SBP (0.064, 95%CI: 0.028, 0.100), fasting glucose (0.055, 95%CI: 0.018, 0.092) and low density lipoprotein
cholesterol (0.052, 95%CI: 0.014, 0.091). With mutual adjustment for each other, these associations remained essentially
unchanged.
Conclusions/Significance: Lower levels of 25(OH)D and higher levels of calcium and PTH appear to be associated with
different cardiovascular risk factors and may therefore affect cardiovascular disease risk through different mechanisms.

Introduction
Increasing evidence suggests a role for mineral metabolism in
cardiovascular disease risk. Lower levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
(25(OH)D,[1­3] and higher levels of parathyroid hormone
(PTH)[4] and calcium[5] have been associated with increased
risk of cardiovascular disease events in prospective cohort studies,
but the mechanisms underlying these associations are unclear.
There is evidence that lower levels of 25(OH)D and higher levels
of PTH are associated with cardiovascular risk factors, including
hyperglycaemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia
and high blood pressure,[5­12] but to our knowledge no previous
study has examined associations of all three of 25(OH)D, PTH and
calcium with cardiovascular risk factors to.
Levels of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium are interdependent.
25(OH)D is a key regulator of circulating calcium levels and of bone
absorption of calcium,[13] and via its action on circulating calcium
levels, indirectly affects PTH levels. PTH is produced by the
parathyroid gland, primarily in response to low calcium levels, and
acts via several mechanisms to increase circulating blood calcium
levels.[14] In addition, the hydroxylation of 25(OH)D in the kidneys
to 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (the active form of vitamin D) is
tightly regulated by plasma PTH and serum calcium levels.[13]
Thus, levels of 25(OH)D, PTH, and calcium may be directly
associated with cardiovascular risk factors or mediated by each other.
The objectives of the current study were (i) to examine the
association of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with a range of
cardiovascular risk factors; (ii) to examine whether associations of
25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with risk factors are independent of
each other or not.
Methods
NHANES is a complex, multistage probability sample of the
healthy, ambulatory population of the U.S. Full details on survey
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e13882
methods can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm.
Data on adults ($20 years old) from three surveys: 2001­2, 2003­
4 and 2005­6 were combined and are included here.
Ethics Statement
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the NCHS
Research Ethics Review Board (ERB) and further ethical approval
for use of NHANES data that is freely available on the web is not
required as it is anonymized. Written consent was obtained from
participants.
Information on age, ethnicity, physical activity, smoking,
alcohol intake in the past month, family income, diabetes and
CHD status (using the Rose angina questionnaire[15]) were self-
reported. A poverty-income ratio (PIR) was calculated for each
family based on self-reported family income in relation to poverty
threshold, family size and calendar year. Values below 1 are below
the official poverty threshold while PIR values of 1 or greater
indicate income above the poverty level (range 0­5). Smoking was
coded as never, ex, currently on some days and currently every
day. Detailed information on leisure time physical activities in the
past month was recorded and assigned a metabolic equivalent
(MET) score. Information on supplementation during the past 30
days was collected and participants were asked to present the
container. Vitamin D intake from supplementation was calculated
per participant according to the brand of supplementation taken.
Participants underwent a medical examination in which weight,
standing height and waist circumference were measured in a
standardized fashion. Seated resting blood pressure was measured
by a physician and calculated as the average of available
measurements (min 1 max 4), excluding the first measurement if
more than one was available.
Blood samples were immediately centrifuged, aliquoted and
frozen at 270uC. Samples were shipped on dry ice to central
laboratories and stored at 270uC. In all three cycles, 25(OH)D
was measured using a Diasorin RIA method. PTH was measured
with an automated analyzer using a sandwich principle in both
2003­2004 and 2005­2006. Calcium was measured using the
LX20 system that uses an indirect (or diluted) ISE methodology.
The method used to measure the albumin concentration on the
LX20 is a bichromatic digital endpoint method. We calculated
albumin adjusted calcium using the formula: adjusted calcium
(mmol/l) = measured total Ca (mmol/l) +0.02 (402 serum
albumin [g/l]).
High density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) was measured by
direct immunoassay. As the assay method was changed in 2003,
we used HDL-c data from the 2003­4 and 2005­6 surveys only.
Triglycerides were measured using a timed-endpoint method. Low
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) levels were derived on
examinees that were examined in the morning session only,
according to the Friedewald calculation, which uses information
on total-, HDL-c and triglycerides.
Fasting insulin, glucose and triglycerides were available for a
random subgroup of participants who attended the morning clinics.
Fasting insulin was measured in 2000­2001 using a radioimmuno-
assay, a two-site immunoenzymometric assay in 2003­2004 and
ELISA in 2005­2006. Linear regression models were used to adjust
2001­2002 and 2005­2006 values to 2003­4 values, as recom-
mended by the National Center for Health Statistics[16]. HOMA-
R was calculated as the product of fasting glucose (mmol/l) and
insulin (mU/ml) divided by the constant 22.5.[17] Plasma glucose
was measured using an enzyme hexokinase method in all included
surveys and the 2005­2006 values (Hitachi 911) were corrected
to the (Roche Cobas Mira method) 2003­2004 values. Serum
creatinine was measured with the Jaffe rate method and measures
from the 2005­2006 survey were corrected according as recom-
mended. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), a measure of kidney
filtration function was estimated with the abbreviated Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease study equation.[18] An oral glucose test
was added to the survey protocol in 2005­2006 and the fasting and
2 hour postload values from this glucose tolerance test are used in
analyses presented here.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were adjusted for sampling probability (via weights)
and cluster effects using the svy procedures in Stata version 10.
Measurements for fasting insulin, HOMA-R, triglycerides and
PTH were naturally log transformed to normalize distributions.
Fasting insulin and HOMA-R are nearly perfectly correlated
(Pearson's r = 0.97). We report result for fasting insulin, however
all results are the same if fasting insulin is replaced with HOMA-R.
Linear regression was used to describe the distribution of
participant characteristics across fifths of the 25(OH)D distribu-
tion, the adjusted calcium and the (logged) PTH distribution. In
multivariable analyses, 25(OH)D, logged PTH, calcium and risk
factors were all z-scored, so that coefficients between each are
directly comparable. In these analyses we adjusted for the
following potential confounders: age, sex, ethnicity, PIR, waist
circumference (or BMI), smoking and physical activity. In the final
model the associations of each exposure with risk factors were
mutually adjusted for the remaining two. Since 25(OHD, PTH
and calcium may act via mediating effects and/or be part of the
same causal mechanism we considered the confounder adjusted
models (before mutual adjustment for each other) to be our best
estimate of the unconfounded association of each with cardiovas-
cular risk factors.
All analyses presented here include data for a random subgroup
of participants who attended the morning clinic and provided
fasting blood samples (N = 6,695). Plasma 25(OH)D was available
for 6,616 and calcium (and albumin) for 6,614 (99%). We excluded
pregnant women (N = 402), participants with a history of diabetes
(N = 758) and angina (N = 155), leaving 5,343 eligible participants.
Of these, complete data on sex, age, ethnicity, PIR, smoking, BMI,
waist circumference, blood pressure, LDL-c, HbA1c, fasting
glucose, insulin and triglycerides was available for 3,958 participants
(74% of eligible). These participants formed our main analysis
sample for analyses with 25(OH)D. PTH was only measured in two
of the three NHANES cycles used in these analyses (2003­2004 and
in 2005­2006) and therefore the analysis sample available for PTH
is 2,554 (75% of those eligible in these two surveys). Physical activity
and alcohol data was additionally available for 66­67% of the
analysis samples for 25(OH)D and PTH. We did not limit analyses
to participants with physical activity and alcohol data, but
compared results for the subgroups with and without these data.
HDL-c was available for 2,564 participants in the 2003­4 and
2005­6 surveys only and 2-hour postload glucose was available for
1,193 participants in the 2005­6 survey only. For these risk factors
analyses are limited to these numbers. We also performed sensitivity
analyses excluding participants with osteoporosis (N = 202) and
those reporting taking vitamin D supplementation (N = 1,457),
excluding participants with fasting glucose values greater than
7 mmol/l (N = 121) and excluding participants with an estimated
GFR ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (N = 239).
Results
Amongst the 3, 958 participants who formed our main analysis
sample weighted mean 25(OH)D was 59.6 nmol/l (SE = 1.01) and
for adjusted calcium it was 2.31 mmol/l (SE = 0.002). Weighted

geometric mean PTH among the 2,554 from the two surveys
where this was assayed was 38.0 ng/l (SE logged PTH = 0.01).
25(OH)D was modestly inversely associated with log PTH
(Pearson's r = 20.28, p-value ,0.001) but was not associated
with adjusted calcium (Pearson's r = 20.01, p-value = 0.49). Log
PTH and adjusted calcium were weakly inversely associated
(Pearson's r = 20.08 p-value = 0.001).
Participant characteristics across fifths of the 25(OH)D dis-
tribution, the PTH distribution and the adjusted calcium distri-
bution are given in Table S1.
Table 1 presents the multivariable analysis of associations of
25(OH)D with cardiovascular risk factors. In age and sex adjusted
models (model 1) there was strong statistical evidence of association
of 25(OH)D with all risk factors except for diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) and LDL-c. For all associations lower 25(OH)D levels were
associated with more adverse cardiovascular risk factor levels. All
associations persisted after controlling for ethnicity, PIR and
smoking (model 2). Inverse associations with systolic blood pressure
(SBP), HbA1c, fasting glucose and fasting insulin, and the positive
association with HDL-c also remained when adding waist
circumference to the models (model 3), but inverse associations
with triglycerides and 2-h postload glucose were attenuated to the
null.
Associations of PTH with cardiovascular risk factors are
presented in Table 2. In age and sex adjusted models PTH was
positively associated with DBP and SBP, HbA1c, fasting and
postload glucose, and fasting insulin. Age and sex adjusted
associations with HbA1c and postload glucose were attenuated
to the null after adjustment for ethnicity, PIR and smoking (model
2). Further adjustment for waist circumference attenuated
associations with SBP, HDL-c and fasting glucose to the null, so
that the only association remaining was that of the positive
association of PTH with DBP (model 3).
Associations of adjusted calcium with cardiovascular risk factors
are presented in Table 3. In age and sex adjusted models calcium
was positively associated with all risk factors except with HDL-c
and DBP (model 1) and these associations remained when
controlling for other potential confounders (models 2 and 3).
Associations observed in the confounder adjusted model (model
3 in tables 1, 2 & 3) were largely unchanged by mutual adjustment
for 25(OH)D, PTH and adjusted calcium (model 4 in tables 1, 2, &
3). The only change was to the confounder adjusted association of
adjusted calcium with DBP (0.007, 95%CI: 20.029, 0.043) which
was strengthened upon adjustment for 25(OH)D and (logged)
PTH (0.062 95%CI: 0.007, 0.116). A closer examination showed
that PTH was the covariable driving this change. This is not
surprising given the lack of evidence of an association between
25(OH)D and adjusted calcium (Pearson's r = 20.01, p-val-
ue = 0.49 and Table S1) and between 25(OH)D and DBP
(Table 1). Figure S1 presents results from the mutually adjusted
models for fasting glucose, insulin and HDL-c.
Of note, results of models 1­3 in Table 1 (25(OH)D as the main
exposure) and Table 3 (adjusted calcium as the main exposure,
N = 3,958) were not different from those presented when the
sample was restricted to participants with PTH measures
(N = 2,554). When BMI was included instead of waist circumfer-
ence, there was no difference to the results presented in model 3 (in
Tables 1­3). Moreover, adding a term for physical activity and
alcohol consumption did not affect results which is expected as
neither was associated with 25(OH)D, PTH or adjusted calcium
(Table S1). Finally, excluding participants diagnosed with
osteoporosis, taking vitamin D supplementation, participants with
elevated fasting glucose or with low eGFR also did not
substantially alter results compared to those presented.
Discussion
We found that 25(OH)D is inversely associated with SBP,
fasting insulin, glucose and HbA1c, and positively associated with
HDL-c, after adjustment for multiple potential confounders in a

general population of adults. These associations were largely
unaffected by adjustment for PTH and adjusted calcium. In
comparison, there was no strong evidence of associations of PTH
with outcomes except for a positive association with DBP and
adjusted calcium was positively associated with all cardiovascular
risk factors except with DBP and HDL-c, with which no
associations were found.
A limited number of studies have previously compared
associations of two of 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium with
cardiovascular risk factors. In one study of older men (N = 410)
and women (N = 660) there was no strong evidence of an
association of 25(OH)D with the metabolic syndrome and a
positive association of PTH with the metabolic syndrome in men
only.[19] By contrast, a previous publication using data only from
the 2003­2004 NHANES survey (N = 1,654) reported an inverse
association of 25(OH)D with metabolic syndrome in both men and
women, and also a positive association of PTH with metabolic
syndrome in older men (. = 50 years) only.[20] The focus on the
metabolic syndrome as opposed to individual cardiovascular risk
factors may have resulted in some of the associations that we have
found here being missed in these two studies. Similarly to our
findings, Zhao et al. found inverse associations of 25(OH)D but
not of PTH with measures of insulin resistance in adult
participants in NHANES 2003­2006.[11] That study did examine

25(OH)D and CVD Risk Factors
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 November 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 11 | e13882
associations with blood pressure or lipids and associations of
25(OH)D were not adjusted for PTH and vice versa.
In the current analysis, associations of 25(OH)D with outcomes
persisted when controlling for PTH and adjusted calcium,
suggesting that 25(OH)D is associated with cardiovascular risk
factors via pathways that are not mediated by the latter. This is in
line with results of a prospective study demonstrating an inverse
association of 25(OH)D with future hyperglycaemia and insulin
resistance, after adjustment for PTH.[9] A recent study examined
associations of PTH and adjusted calcium with cardiovascular risk
factors in a general population of 1,016 Swedish men and women,
70 years old[5]. In that study, PTH was associated with more
cardiovascular risk factors than adjusted calcium, in contrast to
our findings. However, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled
trials of calcium supplementation found that calcium supplemen-
tation was associated with an increased risk of myocardial
infarction, stroke, or sudden death.[21]
We found strong evidence that PTH is positively associated with
DBP and weaker evidence of a positive association with SBP. One
previous cross sectional study found positive associations of PTH
with diastolic and systolic blood pressure and with hypertension,
independent of potential confounding factors and 25(OH)D.[10] In
that study 25(OH)D was not associated with blood pressure variation
or hypertension. Consistent with our findings, a prospective study
using data on sub-samples from the Health Professional's and
Nurses' Health studies found independent inverse associations of
25(OH)D with incident hypertension,[22] and positive associations
of PTH with incident hypertension (the latter using data only from
the male Health Professional study).[23]
Given that chronic kidney disease adversely affects vitamin D status
and is associated with cardiovascular risk,[24] we repeated analyses
excluding participants with moderate or severe chronic kidney disease.
Results were unchanged to those presented suggesting that observed
associations are not driven by participants with chronic kidney disease.
The main limitation of this analysis is that we cannot discern
temporality due to the cross sectional nature of the data and
therefore we cannot infer causality between levels of 25(OH)D,
PTH and adjusted calcium and cardiovascular disease risk factors,
though findings from prospective studies support a direction of effect
from 25(OH)D to hypertension and impaired glucose metabo-
lism.[8,9,22] We were unable to adjust for seasonality of blood
taking but seasonality is unlikely to confound associations, since we
would not expect it to be associated with the outcomes we examined
here, other than through its effect on circulating 25(OH)D.
However, without adjustment for seasonality the associations we
have examined may be an underestimate of the true associa-
tions.[25] Finally, drifts in the 25(OH)D assay performance over
time, likely due to reagent and calibration lot changes in the
reformulated DiaSorin assay, have been noted[26]. However, as
recommended by the National Center for Health Statistics, we
combined data from three cycles in order to obtain stable estimates.
Taken together our findings suggest that the associations of
vitamin D, calcium and PTH with incident cardiovascular
disease[1­4,27] represent different underlying associations with
cardiovascular risk factors, with vitamin D and calcium likely
acting through pathways involving glucose and lipid metabolism
and PTH having a more important effect via blood pressure. It has
been suggested that vitamin D status affects both beta cell function
and insulin release and sensitivity, both being calcium dependent
pathways, as well as inflammatory processes.[9,28] It has also been
suggested that PTH affects blood pressure through a proliferative
effect on vascular smooth muscle cells.[5,29]
To summarize, in a large general population sample of adults
without diabetes or coronary heart disease, we found lower levels
of 25(OH)D to be associated with higher levels of fasting glucose,
insulin and SBP and lower levels of HDL-c. PTH was positively
associated with DBP, but not other cardiovascular risk factors and
adjusted calcium was associated with all outcomes except DBP and
HDL-c. These findings suggest that the recently reported
prospective associations of 25(OH)D and PTH with cardiovascular
disease occur through different underlying associations, with
proximal risk factors. Additional research should examine whether
25(OH)D, calcium and PTH are independently associated with
cardiovascular disease and its risk factors in prospective studies.
Finally, genetic variants that are robustly (and independently)
associated with variation in 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium levels
could be used as instrumental variables[30] to examine their
causal effects on cardiovascular risk factors and events.
