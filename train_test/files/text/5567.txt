Special Collection - Student Diversity
This study examines how a practice-based unit informs
undergraduates' understandings of the dynamics of teaching
and learning in a multicultural society, and how these inter-
sect with equity in U.S. classrooms. Citizens'nuanced under-
standing of the processes of teaching and learning, as well as
their understanding of who schools have served, and how, is
increasingly important for their engagement with U.S.
schools, especially given transformative economic and
demographic changes in the United States.
Information about teachers and the K-12 student population
in the United States highlights a growing demographic mis-
match between U.S. students and teachers: Students of color
will soon outnumber White students (Bureau, 2004; National
Center for Education Statistics, 2015), but the demographic
distribution of both U.S. teachers and teacher candidates
remains largely unchanged, with the large majority of teachers
being White, middle-class women (Feistritzer, 2011; Juárez &
Hayes, 2015; Ludwig, Kirshstein, Sidana, Ardila-Rey, & Bae,
2010). This lack of diversity within the teaching force--where
"the future teachers are White, the teacher educators are White,
the teachers are White" (Juárez & Hayes, 2015, p. 321)--con-
trasts with the growing diversity in the population of children
enrolled in schools. This has been a central research consider-
ation as scholars have studied the "continued under-preparation
of teachers" (Juárez & Hayes, 2015, p. 318), and searched for
ways to support the learning of effective ways to teach across
difference; for example, Milner and Laughter write that "teach-
ers report their relative under-preparedness to work with chil-
dren living around and below the poverty line," and, even
more, that "these same teachers' concerns--most of whom are
White--about teaching children who live in poverty pale in
comparison to their concerns about teaching Black and Brown
students" (Milner & Laughter, 2013, p. 342).
In this study, we explore how practice-based opportuni-
ties can allow undergraduate students to "see" the complex-
ity of teaching and to challenge assumptions about teaching
and learning, which we argue are central to preparing an
informed citizenry in a multicultural society.1

"Our Greatest Songs Are Still Unsung":
Educating Citizens About Schooling in a
Multicultural Society
Simona Goldin1, Erin Elizabeth Flynn2, and Cori Mehan Egan3
Abstract
This study examines how a practice-based unit informs undergraduates' understandings of the dynamics of teaching and
learning in a multicultural society, and how these intersect with equity in U.S. classrooms. Citizens' nuanced understanding of
teaching and learning is increasingly important for their engagement with U.S. schools. Practice-based opportunities can allow
students to "see" the complexity of teaching and to challenge assumptions about teaching and learning, which are central
to preparing an informed citizenry. Findings further suggest that a single course is not sufficient to expand undergraduate
students' understanding of the role of diversity in social life. More concentrated and ongoing efforts may be needed to make
racial, ethnic, economic, and cultural differences salient to students, especially those who have attended largely homogeneous
school contexts such as the students in this study.

This type of preparation is especially needed as the educa-
tional requirements of an information-based economy grow
and the school choice movement increasingly positions par-
ents as critical consumers of educational opportunity (see,
for example, Olson- Beal & Hendry, 2012).
Countering Prevalent Assumptions
About the Simplicity of Teaching
Teaching is often considered a straightforward and easy enter-
prise requiring little special skill beyond having "a knack with
children and keep[ing] them reasonably attentive and enthusi-
astic about learning" (Stevenson & Stigler, 1992, p. 157).
Assumptions about the ease of teaching are broadly shared--
Feiman-Nemser and Remillard note the prevalence of "com-
mon sense theories" such as "`Anyone can teach,'`If you know
your subject, you can teach it,'`Teachers are born not made . . .
'" (Feiman-Nemser & Remillard, 1995, p. 1).As historian Carl
Kaestle notes, Americans from everyday citizens to congres-
sional leaders believe the notion that "Everybody's been to
fourth grade, so everybody knows what good teaching is"
(Kaestle, 1992, p. 27). Even some prospective teachers believe
teaching will be easy, only to quickly find that it is much more
difficult than originally imagined (Darling-Hammond, 2010).
Dan Lortie wrote that future teachers' and citizens'
lengthy "apprenticeship of observation" in U.S. schools con-
strains their ability to analyze, learn about, and conceptualize
teaching and learning in new ways (Lortie, 1975). Lortie
wrote, "the average student has spent 13,000 hours in direct
contact with classrooms by the time he graduates from high
school" (Lortie, 1975, p. 61). A key problem, according to
Lortie, is that students'observations of teachers and teaching
is not systematic or deliberative; instead, it "is intuitive and
imitative rather than explicit and analytical; it is based on
individual personalities rather than pedagogical principles"
(Lortie, 1975, p. 62). What students "see" or "know" about
teaching is not the complexity of pedagogical knowledge,
teachers' assessment of student learning and adaptation of
their practice, and the fluid and multiple dilemmas of teach-
ing that arise over time and across content (Lampert, 1985).
This study is in direct response to this problem, and seeks to
disrupt these normative views of teaching developed over
the lengthy apprenticeship of observation.
Lortie's argument is strongly related to what Tyack and Tobin
referred to as the enduring "grammar of schooling," which pro-
vides consistent rules and structures to schooling (Tyack &
Tobin, 1994). This grammar is conservative--it encourages stu-
dents, teachers, and citizens to expect what they have experi-
enced in schools; thus, it limits the potential for change, reform,
and learning. Teachers, policy makers, and citizens believe that
they "know" how to teach because of their experiences in
schools. But this is particularly problematic for issues of diver-
sity; students and teachers expect others to learn as they have, to
interact with content in the same way, and to understand as they
have.This familiarity with schools, then, can complicate the abil-
ity to understand and analyze the many ways in which diverse
members of our society experience schools in the United States.
Building upon these arguments about the grammar of schooling
and the apprenticeship of observation, we investigate how obser-
vation, analysis, and teaching enable undergraduate students to
examine and question assumptions about teaching and learning,
and how these prepare undergraduates to critically consider
teaching in increasingly multicultural schools.
Preparing citizens requires disrupting common conceptions
of teaching and learning as universal processes, which remain
insensitive to the way that language, culture, and social loca-
tion shape expectations, actions, and perception in the class-
room (Irvine, 1990). Researchers focused on the promise of
multicultural education advocate for the development of reflec-
tive practitioners. Preparation for multicultural schools and
communities necessitates being "watchful," experiencing the
dilemmas of teaching firsthand, and carefully examining those
experiences (Zeichner & Liston, 2013, p. xii). Reflective prac-
titioners use observational, empirical, and analytic abilities to
examine teaching and adapt to the diverse understandings that
surface in multicultural learning communities (Chisholm,
1994; Irvine, 1990; Sharma, 2011). Central to a dispositional
preparation for diverse schools is an appreciation for and
acceptance of "both individual and cultural interpretations of
reality and recognition of cultural and personal thinking and
learning preferences" (Chisholm, 1994, p. 50). Furthermore,
the complexities of diverse spaces are not just personal, but
structural, requiring recognition that schools are "socio-politi-
cal contexts that are not neutral but are based on relations of
power and privilege" (Zeichner et al., 1998, p. 166).
Understanding Teaching as Intricate
Professional Practice
Scholars of teaching have argued that though teaching
might be viewed as "natural" work that one might be "born"
to do, that it is anything but. Ball and Forzani, for example,
describe the "unnatural and intricate nature of instructional
practice." Even more, they write that "Despite the common
view of good teaching as something that is mostly learned
through experience, our argument rests on a conception of
teaching as unnatural work" (Ball & Forzani, 2009, p. 498).
Ball and Forzani--and others--have noted a number of
ways in which teaching is unnatural work. For example,
they write,
consider the role of questions . . . In everyday life, people ask
one another questions to which they do not know the answers.
Teachers, on the other hand, must ask questions all the time to
which they do know the answers: what is the number that lies
between 1.5 and 1.6? . . . (Ball & Forzani, 2009, p. 499)
It is largely from this view of competent teaching as
highly skilled, professional work that the field of teacher
education has increasingly come to consider grounding the
work of learning to teach in what has been called practice-
based teacher education. Building out of the view that
Goldin et al. 3
"making the transition to becoming a professional requires
learning to do things that are not common in daily life and
that most competent adults cannot do well" (Ball & Forzani,
2009, p. 499), scholars have encouraged the revision of
teacher preparation, so that it can be more wholly focused on
practice, where "practice makes practice" (Britzman, 2012;
McDonald et al., 2014). The value of practice derives from
thrusting the student into complex, real-time dilemmas in a
way that other forms of preparation do not.
In light of the widely held belief in the ease of teaching in
the United States and persistent inattention to the rich and
complex possibilities of diverse classrooms, we designed a
study aimed at surfacing undergraduate students' assump-
tions about teaching and learning in a multicultural democ-
racy. We reasoned that as citizens, voters, and potential
future parents, these students have a substantial stake in the
maintenance and improvement of the United States's public
education system.2 We hypothesized the following:
Hypothesis 1: Engaging in a project focused closely on
the dynamics of teaching and learning would develop
undergraduates' ability to analyze the complex and itera-
tive interactions that make up learning opportunities.
In turn, this capacity for analysis might enable insights criti-
cal for civic participation in schooling such as understanding
more deeply what goes into teaching students with diverse
strengths and experiences. Furthermore, all citizens, not just
intending teachers, need more than a surface understanding
of the dynamics of teaching and learning, given the increas-
ingly pivotal role of education as preparation for an increas-
ingly information-based economy.
We argue that citizens who are knowledgeable about,
even connoisseurs of, teaching, are a critical component
needed to improve our current system of education. If we
are to change broadly held conceptions of teaching as sim-
ple or easy work that is innate and prepare citizens to
make effective choices about education, then citizens
need to know more about the mechanisms of teaching and
learning than they might learn solely through their indi-
vidual experiences in schools. Citizens' participation has
been viewed as integral to public schooling from the
founding of the Common Schools in the early 1800s
(Mann, 1846) through contemporary discussions of edu-
cational reform (Chubb & Moe, 1990). We pick up these
long-held views, and argue that citizens' nuanced under-
standing of teaching and learning is increasingly impor-
tant for their engagement with U.S. schools. Thus, we ask:
How do observation, analysis, and teaching enable under-
graduate students to examine and question assumptions
about teaching and learning?
We conclude this article with a consideration of the fol-
lowing question: What do the findings suggest about ways to
prepare undergraduates to critically consider teaching in
increasingly multicultural schools?
Method and Design
In this study, we examine the questions and tensions that
arise when undergraduate students analyze and examine
firsthand experiences learning, observing, and teaching. We
use constant comparative analysis (CCA; Glaser & Strauss,
1967) to examine students' analysis of a three-part unit--the
Teaching and Learning: Historical Investigation (TLHI).
Positioned as learners, observers of another's learning, and
teachers of the same unit, the students drafted, rewrote, and
submitted a final paper on the nature of teaching and learn-
ing. These papers offer a window into how students grappled
with a "backstage" pass to the intellectual work of teaching
and the diverse way that students learn (Grossman, 1991).
Theoretical Framework
This study draws on the work of theorists such as Dewey
(Dewey, 1899/1980, 1902/2001, 1904/1965, 1913, 1916)
and Piaget (Piaget, 1970). In addition, we draw upon the
work of Vygotski and other social constructivist theorists,
who emphasize the students' capacity to draw on existing
knowledge and experience when encountering new informa-
tion. Furthermore, social constructivism assumes that prob-
lem solving in the context of an authentic task allows students
to engage in an ongoing process of revising understandings
and comprehending anew as students co-construct under-
standings in collaborative, social contexts (Vygotski & Cole,
1978). Thus, the design of the TLHI unit deliberately posi-
tioned students to engage in a moment of teaching practice
from three different vantage points, working collaboratively
with others throughout, while engaging in ongoing written
reflection as a way to surface and inform assumptions about
the nature of teaching and learning in contexts characterized
by diversity.
Participants
Participants in this study were enrolled in a school of educa-
tion course devoted to examining schooling in a multicul-
tural society. Sixty-one undergraduate students participated
in this study and 73 participated in the course. Eighty-five
percent of the study sample identified as White; 8% identi-
fied as African American, 5% as Asian American, and 2% as
Arab American. The sample consisted mainly of students
who attended suburban (77%) and public high schools (85%)
prior to enrolling in the university. Students in this sample
characterized their high school settings as serving a rela-
tively homogeneous population of students in terms of race,
ethnicity, or economic status. Only 21% of the sample char-
acterized the student population of their high schools as
"diverse" or "very diverse." Finally, 15% of the students
declared education as their major at the time of the study.
However, slightly more than half the students indicated they
were interested in teaching in some capacity (55%).

Course
The unit under study took place at a large public Midwestern
university in the United States in an undergraduate class that
fulfills the university's race and ethnicity requirement. In this
course, students investigated three questions:
1. What are the purposes of schooling, and for whom?
2. How do schools work, and for whom?
3. What is involved in improving schools?
Across this set of questions, instructors and students attended
to school's competing goals of assimilation and diversity,
opportunity and competition. The course was designed to
help students wrestle with the multiple aims and conceptions
of schooling in a multicultural society (i.e., schools as a
social and economic equalizer; Mann, cited in Cremin, 1957)
or schools as a place centrally concerned with the learning of
academic content (Bestor, 1953). A central and unifying
theme of the course was the evolving, complicated, and often
problematic ways that differences have been understood and
experienced in U.S. schools. As such, the course traces the
history of schooling from the anti-Catholic Bible Riots to the
ongoing saga of segregated schools to the movement for
multilingual rights. Students were supported to develop a
perspective that is at once historically rooted, based on
knowledge of teaching practice, and attentive to current edu-
cational policy.
The instructor cultivated this perspective through three
successive units in the course. The first unit traced the foun-
dations of public education in the United States with particu-
lar attention to ongoing responses to differences in the
schooling system (i.e., the advent of tracking). The second
unit focused on developing an understanding of the practices
of teaching and learning, moving from a macrolevel under-
standing of schooling to a more microlevel analysis of inter-
actions in the classroom. The third unit asked students to
apply their developing knowledge of educational history and
teaching practice to current policy debates, and to articulate
a stance on a critical issue facing today's schools.
The teaching and learning unit.In an effort to develop stu-
dents' understanding of teaching practice, students partici-
pated in a unit of study devoted to teaching and learning.
This section of the course incorporated readings, lectures,
videos of teaching, small group discussions, and the TLHI.
In total, students spent 8 weeks reading, viewing, analyzing,
and teaching during a deliberately scaffolded investigation
of the interactive dynamics of teaching and learning. The
8-week unit culminated with a final paper that asked students
to develop a set of evidence-based claims about the nature of
teaching and learning in U.S. classrooms.
TLHI.Embedded within this 8-week teaching and learning
unit, students participate in the TLHI, a three-part unit
designed by the lead author to help students critically ana-
lyze teaching and learning by holding the unit of study con-
stant.3 The unit was designed so that the students could
engage in a singular unit of learning as students, observers,
and teachers. The content of the TLHI was purposefully con-
structed so that it could be used by students and teachers
across age levels and could be solved in multiple ways. The
TLHI consisted of a study of the internment of Japanese
Americans during WWII. Twelve primary source documents
that consisted of images and quotations offered a range of
perspectives on the internment of Japanese Americans in the
United States. The document set included a copy of execu-
tive order 9066, the presidential executive order that led to
the relocation of Japanese Americans; a map of the intern-
ment camps in the United States; and photographs and quotes
drawn from newspapers, interned Japanese Americans, and
servicemen stationed at Pearl Harbor.
This piece of U.S. history was chosen purposefully
because most students have only modest knowledge about
this moment in history. Of six key U.S. history textbooks,
none covers this more than briefly (see, for example,
Appleby, Brinkley, & McPherson, 2003; Boyer, 2003;
Bragdon, McCutchen, & Ritchie, 1997; Cayton, Perry, Reed,
& Winkler, 2003; Danzer, Klor de Alva, Krieger, Wilson, &
Woloch, 2003; Nash, 2002). Furthermore, Japanese intern-
ment forefronts a key assertion of the course: Individuals of
different social positions experience and respond to events
differently. So too, students interpret and respond to the same
information differently, which is part of the dynamics of
teaching and learning that this unit aimed to highlight for
students unaccustomed to critically examining not only their
own learning, but the learning of others.
Student as learner. The TLHI began by asking students to
answer two questions: (a) What is history? (b) How do you
do history? Next, students examined an image of the USS
Arizona, one of the ships sunk during Pearl Harbor, in flames
and the video testimony of Akiko Kurose, a Japanese Ameri-
can, reflecting on her experience as a child the day after the
attack on Pearl Harbor and her parents' and teachers' fear
of reprisals and racism ("Densho Visual History Collection,"
2011). Then, the instructor introduced students to a graphic
organizer designed to elicit and to record ongoing thinking,
and explained the purpose of each section.As a final prepara-
tory measure, the instructor modeled how to use the graphic
organizer using the map of internment camps in the United
States. Next, students were asked to respond to the questions:
1. What are two likely stories--arguments or theses--
that these documents tell? Use evidence from the
documents to support your evolving historical
inquiry.
2. What are some key questions that you can compose?
Again, use evidence from the documents to support
your questions.
Goldin et al. 5
3. Now that you have begun this study, what other docu-
ments would you need to deepen and enrich your
story?
Each student chose at least three documents to analyze, and used
the graphic organizer to record their observations and developing
theories. After completing their own graphic organizer, students
compared arguments in small groups. Finally, some students
shared their theses during a whole class discussion.
Student as observer.After experiencing the TLHI as stu-
dents, the undergraduates observed the instructor teach the
TLHI to a middle school student recruited from a local public
school. The instructor used the same resources--the graphic
organizer, primary source documents, and content-based
questions, but the middle school student learned the TLHI
in a one-on-one context. When the undergraduate students
completed the TLHI, they alternately worked independently,
in small groups, and as a whole class. This teaching session
was recorded and posted on a shared site so that students
could watch and study the episode, using it as a text for the
analysis of teaching and learning.
Student as teacher. In the final stage of the teaching and
learning unit, each student selected an individual from outside
the class to experience the TLHI. These individuals ranged
from elementary school students to fellow college students
to parents and grandparents. The undergraduate students had
access to an additional 12 documents and other resources for
their own research on the internment of Japanese Americans.
A class was devoted to helping students prepare for their
teaching session. In this class, undergraduates worked with
peers and instructors to select documents for their teaching
session, generate possible questions to guide their teaching,
and complete a planning guide that asked students prepara-
tory questions. Students prepared for and taught the TLHI,
collecting artifacts from their teaching such as notes used in
preparation, their student's graphic organizer, video or audio
recording of the teaching session, and/or transcriptions of
the teaching sessions. Students used evidence collected as
a student, observer, and teacher as the foundation for their
culminating paper on teaching and learning.
Data Sources
The teaching and learning unit culminated with a final paper
that asked students to describe their experience as both a stu-
dent and a teacher of the TLHI as well as make three to five
assertions about "learning and teaching and about how these
are affected by a host of different factors" in the environment.
Analytic Approach
TLHI paper analysis. We employed CCA (Glaser & Strauss,
1967) to examine collegiate students' thinking about
teaching and learning. CCA consists of a three-stage coding
process in which researchers compare data with one another
to further refine labels and establish relationships between
data. In the open-coding stage, each member of the research
team read and reread a single student's paper. We read and
open coded a full two thirds of the data together, discussing
possible codes, relationships between codes, and resolving
overlaps between our tentative labels. Our coding process
was guided by our interest in our main research questions.
Once we developed a shared understanding of the key codes,
we divided the 61 papers among the three research analysts
on the team. We coded the papers with 17 initial codes devel-
oped through the open-coding process. Throughout the cod-
ing process, we discussed ongoing analysis, challenging and
refining each other's interpretations to increase the validity
of our findings.
In the second stage of analysis--axial coding--we used
group discussion, memos, and more intensive analysis of
individual categories to establish properties of codes and
expand or collapse codes as needed. We collapsed our ini-
tial set of labels into six codes--teacher actions (such as
planning, assessing, and adapting), differences, work of
learning, discovery, teaching and learning as related, and
teaching as complex. Next, we divided the six categories
among the data analysts and looked within each category
for common patterns and potential nuances in the data. For
example, within the category of differences, students char-
acterized learners as bringing different learning styles, dif-
ferent prior knowledge, different perspectives, and different
racial, ethnic, cultural, or economic backgrounds to the
work of the learning. Furthermore, the students suggest
these differences can serve as a challenge, a source of
strength, or simply a factor that teachers must attend to in
the classroom. This second level of analysis helped flesh
out the categories, highlighting interactions between the
concepts. For example, in the category of student discov-
ery, students claim that discovering information on their
own improves the quality of learning, but they also describe
the teacher's role in "allowing" such learning to take place
as exemplified in this quote:
It is sometimes an effective strategy to let your students figure
things out for themselves instead of just giving them the answer.
In order to help students understand why something is true
instead of just how to find the answer, it is important to let them
work through the problems themselves and with other classmates
before the teacher jumps in to give them the answer. By doing
this, the students will be able to reason through why certain
answers are right or wrong.
In this way, student discovery is not just about what students
do, but what teachers do as well. Throughout this stage of
analysis, members of the research team wrote weekly memos,
discussed ongoing analysis, and tested and corroborated
developing theories. Table A1 briefly overviews the main
categories in the data.
6 SAGE Open
Finally, in the selective coding stage, we revisited the data
looking for confirming and contradicting evidence of our
developing hypotheses. We used this process to consistently
challenge the theories developed through the coding process.
Each team member created a key linkage chart to show the
relationships between central codes in the data. We used the
charts to generate tentative assertions. All three initial asser-
tions situated teacher actions and student discovery as two
potential core categories of the data, around which the other
codes relate. After finding a high level of agreement among
the three analysts' assertions, we discussed and refined our
thinking to create a provisional assertion.
To further corroborate our coding, we presented a subset
of our data to seven colleagues with experience in qualitative
methods and research interests centered on the learning of
prospective teachers. We asked these collaborators to open
code a subset of exemplars drawn from four of the six main
categories from our data. We also solicited feedback about
any exemplars that did not seem to belong in the same cate-
gory as other data. All seven respondents largely substanti-
ated our coding scheme with the exception of minor
differences in choices of language. For example, two respon-
dents suggested the label "constructivist learning" in lieu of
"student discovery." We chose to maintain the label "discov-
ery" because it reflected the students' own language in
describing a facet of learning.
Results
The TLHI created an opportunity for students to examine
their understanding of teaching and learning. Our findings
indicate that students in this study saw teaching and learning
as highly related. They wrote that teaching is deliberate,
interactive work that not only involves a good deal of plan-
ning but also requires flexibility, in the moment decision
making, and the ability to simultaneously meet a multitude
of student needs. For these undergraduates, a fundamental
tension of teaching and learning arises from the interactive
nature of teaching. Because teaching is complex interac-
tional work, it requires knowledge about the student, plan-
ning, and adaptation--all new insights for individuals who
had experienced classrooms as students, but not as teachers.
What students bring to the work of learning--prior knowl-
edge, learning styles, perspectives, and racial, ethnic, or eco-
nomic backgrounds--is of tremendous consequence for
what teachers do, and for what students learn.
Below we consider (a) TLHI students' understanding of
teaching and learning as highly related, interactive work; (b)
the importance they placed on student differences in back-
ground and perspective; (c) their understanding of teachers'
work as planning and adapting instruction to meet student
needs; and (d) TLHI students' notion of students' learning,
which they described as a dynamic process of "discovery."
The sum of these understandings is that teaching is interac-
tional, sophisticated work. For example, one student wrote,
Teaching and learning are complex processes, which students
and teachers actively engage in every time they enter a
classroom. On the surface, the goal of teaching seems obvious--
to educate the students. However, a lot more careful planning
and intricate evaluation of situations are involved when it comes
to educating a group of students.
The TLHI students found that though teaching might appear,
on the "surface" to be straightforward, it is actually complex
work involving detailed planning and ongoing assessment of
multiple "situations" related to student learning. In this
respect, the TLHI helped students see beyond simplistic
views of teaching to the planning, assessing, decision mak-
ing, and adapting that makes classroom learning possible.
Teaching and Learning as Interactive Work
The students in this study saw the student and the teacher as
both actively contributing to learning outcomes. More than
40% of the TLHI students saw teachers and students in a
kind of partnership that operates as "a two-way street." As
one student noted,
I have found that the most effective learning is accomplished
through a process of give-and-take. The pursuit of knowledge is
not a one-sided effort, but a collective journey in which the
classroom must be seen as a forum, and teaching and learning
must be seen as two sides of the same coin.
For students in this study, teachers and students work
together closely in what another student described as a
"complicated relationship that connects them." This rela-
tionship is important because what teachers and students do
in the classroom depends on one another. In a representa-
tive comment, one TLHI student noted, "Through the
investigation of teaching and learning, I have been able to
understand the importance of the relationship between
teachers and students, and how each of their roles is directly
affected by one another."
Our students' understanding of teaching and learning
hinged on the insight that teaching and learning are highly
interactive works. For example, students saw teaching as
dependent upon students' engagement, and wrote that teach-
ers' reliance on students increases the complexity of the iter-
ative enterprise:
Teachers have a tough job--they are responsible for fostering
the learning and success of others and therefore must be able to
challenge students, be cognizant of student struggles and bias
tendencies, and be able to alter their teaching to increase student
learning.
They saw teachers as "responsible" not only for their own
work, such as planning, but also for the actions of others--
what students do with the opportunities and resources teach-
ers provide.
Goldin et al. 7
Student Differences
The majority of these students (59%) were surprised to learn
that not everyone learns like they do, in classes like they did.
For example, one student wrote, "Since every student
approaches learning with his or her own perspective and
experiences, every student comes to understand knowledge
differently." This suggests an important breakdown in
assumptions about schooling. As another student com-
mented, "I was originally under the impression that there
was always an easier way to learn something, and that that
was the best way for everyone. But after observing my peers
this was easily not the case." Instead, TLHI students realized
that students learn differently. Because students learn differ-
ently, teachers must know their students to meet their needs.
On this, one student wrote, "It is also important for teachers
to know how their students learn, or at least to acknowledge
that different students learn in different ways."
Teachers need to understand not only a student's learning
style but also what students know, and what they bring to
their work in classrooms. This point reflects a growing
understanding of the importance of knowing students to be
receptive to their learning. This view was represented in stu-
dents' writing. Students asserted that the social and motiva-
tional aspects of learning are defining aspects of successful
classrooms. Forty-five percent of the TLHI students asserted
that teachers need to know them, relate to them, and make
learning experiences meaningful and relevant to their lives.
To this end, one student wrote,
It is important to give learning a purpose and a meaning while
teaching so that your students are motivated to learn. If students
believe that they have no reason to be learning the information
that you're teaching them, then they will most likely not pay
attention or will not have any interest in the lesson at all.
For these students, learners not only interpret information
differently based on their background and experiences, but
they are motivated and engaged by teachers who know them
and connect content to their lives.
Expanding on this point, just more than a quarter of our
students (26%) acknowledged that a student's racial, ethnic,
economic, or cultural background was an important determi-
nant in student engagement and learning in the classroom. In
a representative comment, one student wrote, "When the
pedagogical content is culturally relevant to the students, they
will optimally learn." For this subset of TLHI students, what
students know and bring to their classroom work is, in part,
shaped by their social, economic, or cultural backgrounds,
particularly in terms of the extent to which instruction is rel-
evant to their everyday lives. Notably, despite the emphasis of
the course on multiculturalism and the centrality of different
social positions in shaping understanding in the TLHI unit of
history, relatively few students noticed how social, economic,
and cultural positioning might inform learning.
A subset of students (25%) found that differences in per-
spective, understanding, and background help students to
learn. As students experienced the TLHI as students, this
portion of students wrote about the benefit of differences in
classrooms. For example, one student wrote, "Some of my
classmates have commented that hearing the diverse opin-
ions of other students helps them to add new knowledge to
what they already know." Another recalled,
Very quickly my partner and I established we had very different
political viewpoints. We disagreed about a few interpretations
and our stories reflected very different concerns with the
Japanese internment. Reflecting on this, I realize the many
benefits that come with a diverse classroom--diverse in terms
of not only backgrounds, but also in cultures and in this particular
example, viewpoints.
Although student differences pose challenges for teachers'
practice, they can enrich student learning when teachers
position students to work with one another. In this way, TLHI
students saw how students could be resources for one anoth-
er's learning.
The Role of the Teacher: Planning and Adapting
Students experienced and wrote about "difference" in two
contexts: the impact difference has on students' learning and
on teacher's actions. One student wrote, "Every student
comes to class with a unique learning style and perspective,
and, it is the teacher's mission to teach the same information
to every student despite those discrepancies." For these stu-
dents, difference seemed to be a natural part of a classroom
environment, and teachers must adapt to an array of under-
standings, viewpoints, strengths, weaknesses, and needs.
Although these students acknowledged that teacher actions
in response to student difference often contributed to the dif-
ficulty and complexity of teaching, they saw how teachers
react to difference is a vital component of effective instruc-
tion. For the TLHI students, teachers respond to student dif-
ferences by preparing "for variability," "identify[ing] the
learners' strengths and weaknesses," "mak[ing] the school-
work fit each student's style of learning," and "explain[ing]
different concepts in different ways." One student wrote,
"Each student has a unique type of learning style as well as
different cultural backgrounds; therefore teachers must be
flexible to match the needs of their students." TLHI students
not only viewed difference as a challenge to teachers but also
argued that difference should inform and even determine a
teacher's pedagogical choices and behavior. Students wrote
that teachers should constantly adapt to student understand-
ings and differences.
Seeing teaching and learning as highly interactive, stu-
dents felt teachers needed to be able to "expect the unex-
pected" and engage in detailed planning as well as
in-the-moment adjustments. For instance, one student wrote,
8 SAGE Open
The teacher needs to be prepared for the unexpected, the lesson
plan may not go the way that they exactly planned, or the
students may ask questions that the teacher doesn't expect or
cover in the lesson plan. It is important for the teacher to be able
to answer these questions or change the lesson plan on the fly;
otherwise the class won't run as smoothly.
For these students, teachers need to demonstrate a kind of
nimbleness, flexibly altering plans in the moment. Although
the students recognized the value of planning, they noted,
"While a teacher can plan out a lesson, they cannot plan their
students' reactions, forcing teachers to deal with reactions as
they come." As such, students wrote that teachers must both
plan for the unexpected by preparing in an organized way
and be able to alter their lesson plan fluidly, in the moment.
Although students saw adapting to students as a challenging
but indispensable aspect of teaching, they also recognized
the benefits that stem from the interactive nature of teaching
and learning. One student wrote,
I learned to be prepared for things to possibly go in directions
you don't expect. Obviously it is still important to keep the goals
in mind, but sometimes the most profound learning can be a
complete surprise even to the teacher.
TLHI students wrote that teachers' practice should be
responsive and iterative, and that they need to adapt their
work precisely because of the interactional nature of teach-
ing and learning. They asserted that teachers adapt to the
unexpected by "over-preparing," organizing, preparing for
unexpected questions and preparing for the unforeseen. For
example, one student wrote,
Another large segment of what I learned is to prepare oneself for
the unforeseen. While this is a metaphor, the premise remains
unchanged when you apply it to the instruction of a child; they
can ask surprising questions and construct strange truths of their
own. A teacher must strive to allow his or her lesson plan to not
be diminished by an unknown question, but strengthened by the
want of students to explore a concept further.
The TLHI students wrote that the highly interactive nature of
teacher necessitates that teachers plan for the unexpected in
advance of teaching, and that they adapt their practice while
teaching to accommodate their students' needs and learning
goals.
Interestingly, the TLHI unit occasioned students' under-
standing of the differences that students bring to the class-
room and how those differences bring about diverse
responses to learning opportunities in the classroom. For the
TLHI students, diverse and unexpected understandings
require a nimble teacher, capable of adapting instruction
according to in-the-moment interactions in the classroom.
This conception of classroom learning derives, at least in
part, from the fact that the TLHI unit did not help the stu-
dents, in this study, see how individual students wrestle with
learning challenges in patterned ways, which help teachers
anticipate common problems and misconceptions during
planning and classroom instruction. Consequently, as first-
time instructors, the TLHI students could not see how some
student responses might cease to be "unexpected" after
increased teaching experience.
The Role of Student Discovery
Just above 60% of students wrote of the importance of stu-
dent discovery. Students asserted that teacher adaptation and
student discovery are highly related--that is, teachers must
adapt to "let" students discover:
For teaching, I found that in order to be able to make sure that a
student gets as much as he or she can out of a lesson a teacher
must be able to adapt to different situations, and that allowing
students to work things out on their own, with only giving
leading questions when needed, can be a great tool while
teaching them because instead of spitting back out what they
were just told, the students form their own ideas.
Because teaching and learning are carried out in interaction
with others, teachers must continuously be responsive to
what students bring to their work. One student described this
relationship by writing, "Everyone brings a different per-
spective to the classroom and it is important to cultivate that
by letting their own ideas grow."
Teachers are also, in this view, dependent upon students
as much as students are dependent upon teachers. Thus, "dis-
covery" is not only what students do to learn but also what
teachers enable. Describing how teachers enable student dis-
covery, one student wrote,
I began to think about the value of the "Ah-Ha" moment. Like
the very first video we watched in class and the debate over if six
was odd or even, the teacher took the back seat and allowed self-
discovery to occur. (Mathematics Teaching and Learning to
Teach, 2010)
A second student described teachers' work by saying,
"Teachers must help without doing." For the TLHI students,
the work of teaching involves letting students do the work--
analyzing, questioning, and discussing information. Teachers
enable student work by providing resources and adapting to
student understandings, but they cannot learn for students.
According to our students, self-discovery is important
because it makes learning more "memorable," it enables stu-
dents to "learn deeply," and it is "motivating." One student
wrote, "In learning, a student's direct discovery, or the pro-
cess of finding knowledge and information for oneself, cre-
ates a more memorable and effective experience because
these connections are being made inside the student's head."
Emphasizing the value of such learning, our students con-
trasted insights that their learners discovered on their own
with information that is "regurgitated" or "spitting back out
Goldin et al. 9
what they [learners] were just told." For the TLHI students,
student discovery created conceptual understanding, which
they recognized as more valuable than more superficial dem-
onstrations of learning such as memorization.
Students wrote that adaptive teaching and self-discovery
can lead to sophisticated learning. For example, one student
wrote, "by fostering an environment of student self-discov-
ery, teachers of students of all grade-levels are capable of
eliciting high-level, analytical theory building." But, they
ascertained that enacting adaptive teaching and engaged
"discovery" is challenging work. For example, one student
wrote,
It is extremely important but difficult for educators not to simply
tell students what they want to know. While it may seem easier,
this is a disservice to students because it inhibits them from
formulating their own, unbiased ideas. It is both a challenge for
the student to come up with conclusions on their own and a
challenge for the teacher to let students come to conclusions on
their own. But this challenge ultimately pays off.
TLHI students concluded that teaching is challenging work
that necessitates time, skill, and effective teaching practices.
They also found that negotiating these challenges "pays off"
by positioning students to come to their own conclusions.
The Complexity of Teaching and Learning
The TLHI students saw students as taking up or using the
resources and opportunities that teachers make available.
They wrote that students must engage with content and each
other if they are to learn. According a prominent role to indi-
vidual student differences, students noted that teaching is
challenging precisely because classrooms consist of a multi-
plicity of individuals. In a representative statement, one stu-
dent wrote, "trying to understand my single learner in
teaching Japanese internment and cater to her needs was dif-
ficult enough, even while it lacked the complexities of a
larger classroom that is more typical of the American educa-
tion system." Students wrote that classrooms are comprised
of individual students who understand and take up work with
their teachers and content in differential ways: "As a teacher
next year, I am likely to be charged with negotiating students
of all different backgrounds, aptitudes, abilities, and work
ethic." Because effective instruction necessitates adaptive
teaching practice, individual student differences challenge
teachers' work. One student wrote,
Having students with varied learning styles and differing
interpretations of information poses a challenge because the
teacher must find a balance between teaching styles so that all
students have a chance to learn in a way that suits them and how
they interpret the information.
Schooling in a democratic, multicultural society necessitates
this careful balancing between the individual and the group;
"finding that balance" contributes to the complexity of
teaching.
A key theme that emerged from the data has to do with the
complexity of teaching; nearly three quarters of our students
wrote about the complexity of the work of teaching. Students
wrote that the interactional nature of teaching makes it a fun-
damentally complex endeavor. One student asserted,
I used to view teaching as a simple task with few issues until I
began researching only to find how many issues and dilemmas
teachers are faced with on a daily basis--from large scale issues
such as time management within the classroom to smaller scale
issues, which need to be dealt with in the moment like not
knowing the correct answer to a question.
Students wrote that teaching is complex because teachers
need to continually weigh the efficacy of different teacher
moves, because teachers are dependent upon student work
for learning outcomes, and because student differences sig-
nificantly affect how and what students learn and understand.
Students wrote that the in-the-moment work of teaching
makes managing this work particularly complex: "when
teaching, teachers need to be alert the whole time and they
need to make decisions every minute."
A subset of students--nearly a third--wrote that prior to
their systematic study of the practices of teaching and learn-
ing, they had not seen teaching as complex:
I have come to appreciate the complexity and richness behind
both the process of teaching and of learning. Before this, I
viewed teaching as an easy task, and learning as a simple
undertaking done in one way, with nothing from the past having
an effect. However, I now realize how truly wrong I was in both
of these views.
These students reported that they revised their views of
teaching. They wrote that this unit helped them to perceive
and appreciate aspects of the work of teaching that had been
invisible when they were students themselves. As one stu-
dent noted, "I honestly went in to the experience thinking
that it would be easy because I have been attending class and
watching how professors have taught throughout my entire
life." For this subset of students, their lengthy experience in
schools as students led them to see teaching as relatively
simple work that they were prepared to do.
In this way, students challenged the previously held views
of teaching and learning. The invisible became visible, as
one student wrote,
Simply sitting back and watching Professor Author teach Sean
and even while she was teaching our own class the lesson, I was
unable to fully grasp how much preparation teaching a lesson
well, really takes, and this was until I had to begin to try to teach
the lesson myself. I think that there is a lot of outside work that
a teacher must do to make the lesson a success that the learner
often does not see or may even overlook. Most importantly,
10 SAGE Open
though, I think that it is this preparation work that really makes
a lesson a success or a failure.
Similarly, another student wrote, "after being a student for so
many years, having the opportunity to teach allowed me to
understand the difficulty that is teaching." Thus, studying
teaching in the TLHI disrupted students' views of the cogni-
tive and professional demands of teaching.
Discussion
In 1893, J. M. Rice decried the paucity of citizens' "intelli-
gent interest" in schools:
In the large majority of instances the people take absolutely no
active interest in their schools. I do not here refer to that form of
interest which manifests itself on the part of the citizens of most
localities in a certain pride in their own particular schools, which
they consider the best in the country, but which pride is founded
neither on a knowledge of what is going on in other schools, or
even in their own schools, nor upon the slightest knowledge of
the science of education; but I refer to an intelligent interest, an
interest sufficiently deep to lead one to follow closely the actions
of the board of education, the superintendent, and the teachers,
and to seek some knowledge of the scientific development of
children. If but one parent in a hundred would be interested to
this extent, I believe that most of our flagrant educational evils
would disappear. (Rice, 1893, p. 10)
To Rice, citizens' knowledge about teaching and learning
would be so powerful as to eliminate the "educational evils"
of his day. The research we report here takes up these very
points. We argue that recent educational reforms overlook a
critical component needed to improve our current system of
education--citizens who are knowledgeable about, even
connoisseurs of, teaching. Such a connoisseurship rests on
two central understandings: teaching (a) is intricate profes-
sional practice and (b) is informed by diversity in multicul-
tural democracies.
To date, scholars have written about practice-based pro-
fessional teacher education, and how "making practice the
core of teachers' professional preparation" is critical for
addressing the "common views of teaching as idiosyncratic
and independently creative" (Ball & Forzani, 2009, p. 497).
We extend scholars' interest in practice-based education, as
we design and research a practice-based unit and study its
use in an undergraduate course with students who are inter-
ested in education, but do not necessarily plan to pursue a
degree in education. This is critical, for many scholars have
argued that teachers face a "dilemma" as they "carry out their
work in the face of students who, guided by years of memo-
ries, filter and interpret teacher education coursework
according to their preconceived beliefs about how to teach"
(Balli, 2014, p. 105), an obstacle to preparing all undergradu-
ate students to reenvision schooling as a preparation for
citizenship.
We investigated the following questions: How do obser-
vation, analysis, and teaching experience enable undergradu-
ate students to examine and question assumptions about
teaching and learning? What does this suggest about ways to
prepare undergraduates to critically consider teaching in
increasingly multicultural schools? Leveraging the power of
practice-based experience, students engaged in a three-part
study, which positioned them as students, observers, and
teachers of a unit on Japanese internment. The TLHI worked
as a scaffold for generating insights about the nature of teach-
ing and learning not typically available to students, because
students had access not only to their own learning but also to
points of comparison made possible by examining the learn-
ing of others. In structure and content, the TLHI aimed to
disrupt common conceptions about the ease of teaching as
well as restricted and homogenizing conceptions of learning
preferences and processes.
In terms of students' developing understanding of teach-
ing as intricate professional practice, we report that students
engaged in nuanced ways of thinking about teaching and
learning. Specifically, these undergraduates argued that stu-
dents bring important differences to the classroom, that what
teachers do depends on students and their developing under-
standing and sense making, that teaching consists of plan-
ning and adapting in the moment, and that teaching is
complex interactional work. Each of these represents an
increasing connoisseurship of teaching developed by engag-
ing in the instructional planning, decision making, assess-
ment and other practices that are normally hidden from the
view of students (Grossman, 1991). Even more, this cuts
against the view of teaching as "natural," and instead, privi-
leges the view of "teaching as a highly skilled practice, one
that requires close training (Ball & Forzani, 2009, p. 508).As
Rice wrote two centuries ago, without knowledge about and
understanding of the work of the teaching, ordinary citizens'
abilities to make important decisions--as voters, citizens,
and parents--are constrained.
Limitations
The TLHI offers a promising beginning for how to prepare
undergraduate students for a lifetime of engagement with
public schooling. Recent reforms assume that individuals
have the necessary knowledge to make choices about school-
ing simply because as Kaestle notes, "Everybody's been to
fourth grade" (Kaestle, 1992, p. 27). As research into every-
day citizens' "apprenticeship of observation" in schools sug-
gests, simply experiencing teaching as students offers a
shallow preparation for understanding the complexity of
teaching and learning. The TLHI made this complexity more
transparent for the TLHI students in this study. However, this
study represents only one particular context. We need to
know more about how other individuals in other contexts
might take up such a "backstage" pass to teaching (Grossman,
1991). By inviting a larger and more diverse number of
Goldin et al. 11
citizens to analyze the complex, iterative interactions that
occur in teaching and learning, the value of initiating citizens
into the complexity of teaching can be better understood.
Evidence from this study suggests that the TLHI offers
something on which to build. Even over a short period, TLHI
students demonstrated insight into teaching and learning that
went beyond what one might conclude from everyday expe-
rience. The TLHI was designed to plant seeds--new insights
and ways of thinking--that would continue to grow. Long-
term study is needed to determine to what extent this type of
engagement influences future thinking and decision making
about education. Although it is clear that recent reform
efforts overlook enhancing the knowledge of everyday citi-
zens, further study is needed to determine the extent to which
units such as the TLHI substantively address this need over
the long term.
Implications
This study's findings are important for efforts to enrich the
practices and pedagogy of postsecondary education. As citi-
zens who will make important decisions about schooling, all
undergraduates need to understand the complex interactional
work of teaching and learning, not just intending teachers. At
the start of this article, we asked the following: What do the
findings suggest about ways to prepare undergraduates to
critically consider teaching in increasingly multicultural
schools? In part, this study illuminates how practice-based
opportunities can allow individuals to "see" the complexity
of teaching and to challenge assumptions about teaching and
learning. We assert that a fundamental means to do this is to
position students to critically analyze teaching from multiple
perspectives. Feiman-Nemser and Remillard wrote that
"deeply rooted . . . views of teaching and learning are unlikely
to change unless alternative experiences challenge their
validity" (Feiman-Nemser & Remillard, 1995, p. 9). This
unit provided students the opportunity to challenge existing
views and "discover" for themselves the complexity of
teaching. This discovery is important because as U.S. school-
ing shifts toward a system in which citizens are consumers,
parents are increasingly required to make informed choices
between possible school placements for their children.
Postsecondary education needs to play a role in preparing
citizens for this kind of civic engagement.
Our research shows that this firsthand investigation of
teaching and learning enabled undergraduates to understand
that teaching is a profoundly multifaceted practice. Students'
emerging understanding of teaching allowed them to better
understand how it is that education plays out in a multicul-
tural society. Enabling students to see that "we all learn dif-
ferently" is important because it facilitates citizens' abilities
to understand the multiple and complex demands of teaching
in an increasingly diverse society. It also highlights the ben-
efits derived from working closely with others with diverse
backgrounds and experiences. Schooling in a democratic,
multicultural society necessitates a careful balancing between
the individual and the group. Teaching can be challenging
precisely because classrooms consist of a multiplicity of
individuals, but it can be rewarding for teachers and students
as well because both teachers and students learn from the
insights of others.
Although the students in this study recognized that stu-
dents bring differences to the classroom, which shape their
understanding and necessitate a responsive teacher, the
majority of TLHI students did not see these differences as
arising from diverse experiences or perspectives shaped by
racial, ethnic, economic, or cultural backgrounds. The course
in which the TLHI took place focused on schooling as a
socially shaped enterprise through which society negotiated
tensions over social, economic, and cultural differences. The
tensions charted in the course ranged from the earliest years
of public schools (i.e., sectarian violence between Catholics
and Protestants over the reading of the Lord's Prayer) up to
more present-day concerns such as the struggle for bilingual
resources in schools, powerfully dramatized by the student-
led protests in Crystal City, Texas, in the early 1970s
(Mondale & Patton, 2001). Yet, TLHI students, in their anal-
ysis of teaching and learning, did not attribute the unique
perspectives of students that they saw as so pivotal to learn-
ing to the social, economic, and cultural differences that
shape students' experiences and perspectives. Instead, they
made more general claims about the nature of each individu-
al's unique life experience and perspective.
Furthermore, the TLHI unit foregrounded the disparate
perspectives of citizens who occupied different social posi-
tions with regard to Japanese internment, showing how the
same event can be experienced and interpreted in vastly dif-
ferent ways by individuals in a diverse society. The varied
interpretations of events were reflected not only in the docu-
ments provided for study but also in the TLHI students'
developing theories that derived from analysis of these docu-
ments. Despite this heavy emphasis on the ways that race,
ethnicity, economic status, and cultural background inform
and shape individuals' opportunities for learning and experi-
ence of those opportunities, the TLHI unit made the role of
social, economic, and cultural backgrounds in learning trans-
parent for some, but not all the students in this study. This
finding suggests that a single course is not sufficient to
expand undergraduate students' understanding of the role of
diversity in social life. As detailed here, the demographics of
the course under study reflect the lack of diversity in the
teaching force, as 85% of the study sample identify as White.
We reflect again here on the demographics of the study,
and the difficulty of changing minds around issues of diver-
sity, and of the broad scholarship on White fragility
(DiAngelo, 2011; Matias, 2016). More concentrated and
ongoing efforts may be needed to make racial, ethnic, eco-
nomic, and cultural differences salient to students, especially
those who have attended largely homogeneous school con-
texts such as the students in this study. Indeed, this finding
12 SAGE Open
echoes calls for preparation for multicultural communities to
not reside in single classes, but to permeate the curriculum in
postsecondary settings (Gay, 2002; Ladson-Billings, 1995a;
Ladson-Billings, 1995b; Sharma, 2011; Zeichner et al.,
1998); doing this, DiAngelo (2011) writes would break the
modal experience, whereby "many white people have never
been given direct or complex information about racism
before, and often cannot explicitly see, feel or understand it"
(p. 67).
The students in this study recognized a multiplicity of dif-
ferences in the classroom, but were unable to see the pat-
terned ways that students respond to particular content and
learning arrangements. Consequently, the TLHI students
imagined classrooms in which teachers were left to respond
in the moment to unknown and unpredictable challenges. In
this way, the TLHI unit enabled students to see the complex
demands of teaching, but offered less access to the ways that
experienced teachers learn to grapple with these challenges
over time. The inability of students to see patterns in stu-
dents' responses suggests the need for complementary expe-
riences that provide the opportunity for students to see
common responses and perspectives as well as differences in
the classroom.
Participation in the TLHI led students to write that they
could "see" teaching and learning as they had not seen
before. As we, as a nation, continue to invest substantial
resources to improving schools, "seeing" the complexity
of teaching practice is important for the construction and
support of policies, which will support what researchers
have called "ambitious" (Lampert, 2005; Lampert &
Graziani, 2009), "adventurous" (Cohen, 1988), or "reform-
minded" teaching--teaching that encourages students to
ask, explain, and problem solve, and that positions all stu-
dents as capable of learning sophisticated, challenging
academic content (Feiman-Nemser, 2001). Such teaching
is possible when it is understood, valued, and protected
from calls to diminish intellectual engagement for a focus
solely on basic skills. Recognizing that learning is a pro-
cess of intellectual "discovery" is a seemingly simple
insight, which supports teaching that positions students as
capable, critical thinkers, rather than passive consumers of
information. Preparing all undergraduate students to
understand and appreciate the complexity of teaching in
increasingly diverse schooling contexts offers an impor-
tant way to protect and advance ambitious teaching, a core
resource for democratic societies.

Category Description Example
Teaching and
learning as
related
Teaching and learning described as
interrelated
"I have found that the most effective learning is accomplished
through a process of give-and-take. The pursuit of knowledge
is not a one-sided effort, but a collective journey in which the
classroom must be seen as a forum, and teaching and learning
must be seen as two sides of the same coin."
Teaching as
complex
Teaching described as complicated, difficult,
or complex
"Even the best of teachers struggle to make sure everyone in the
class is learning what is being taught. Teachers have to worry
about how they are teaching a topic, how it is coming across,
if it is being learned, and who is learning it. This experience has
taught me that teaching is a complicated profession and teachers
are not given enough credit for all that they do."
Teacher
actions
Description of teacher actions including
assessing learning, planning, adapting,
questioning students, and facilitating
learning
Adaptation--"Another thing I learned when teaching the Problem
of History is that a teacher's lesson plan must be malleable, and
a teacher must be willing to make adjustments according to
what their student needs."
Work of
learning
Description of what students do to learn
including asking questions and working
with others
"When discussing the topic of learning, asking questions (both
externally to others and internally in one's head) is one of the
best ways to delve into more complex, multi-layered thinking."
Discovery Description of learning as an act of
discovery, often includes notion that
students learn more, deeper, or in a longer
lasting way from discovery
"The feeling of satisfaction that arises from discovering new
information without being directly told encourages a student to
continue learning and making new findings."
Student
differences
Description of sources of student differences
including different prior knowledge,
learning styles, perspectives, and racial,
ethnic, or economic backgrounds
"I never really understood the importance of considering all the
possible perspectives of the students in a class. Just because the
students are in the same grade doesn't mean that they all have
the same knowledge base and that they all learn the same way."

Notes
1. Many scholars and practitioners have called for a turn toward
"practice" as a fundamental means for learning teaching. For
example, Ball and Cohen (1999) assert the importance of con-
structing opportunities for practitioners to become "serious
learners in and around their practice" (p. 3). More recently,
Janssen, Grossman, and Westbroek (2015) argued that though
there is some variation in the increasing focus on practice-based
teacher education, that these approaches are "united by a turn
towards a greater emphasis on clinical experience" (p. 137).
2. When we refer to "citizens," we are referring to civic partici-
pation. We do not intend to exclude individuals who are not
legal citizens, but still participate in schools as students, par-
ents, and important members of our communities.
3. A previous iteration of this assignment was designed by
Deborah Loewenberg Ball, and focused on mathematics. The
lead author revised this assignment, focusing it on the histori-
cal investigation described here.
