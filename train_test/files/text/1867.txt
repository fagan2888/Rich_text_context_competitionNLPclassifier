Health risks associated with the active use of
tobacco have been documented extensively
over many years. After the first Surgeon
General's report on smoking and health in
1964, the prevalence of cigarette smoking in
the United States began a gradual decline
[Department of Health and Human Services
(DHHS) 2000a], although the use of tobacco
continues to be an important problem and
remains the leading preventable cause of
death and disability in the United States
(DHHS 2004). In addition to mainstream
smoke that is inhaled by the smoker, burning
cigarettes also generate secondhand smoke
[SHS; also sometimes referred to as environ-
mental tobacco smoke (ETS)] that is formed
from smoke emitted into the environment
from the smoldering tip of the cigarette,
mixed with smoke exhaled by the smoker
[National Research Council (NRC) 1986].
Involuntary smoking results when nonsmok-
ers are exposed to SHS, and health risks for
nonsmokers posed by involuntary smoking
were gradually realized. As early as 1972, the
topic of SHS and the potential risk faced by
nonsmokers exposed to SHS were noted in a
Surgeon General's report addressing the use
of tobacco (DHHS 1972). An important fur-
ther impetus for investigations regarding
adverse health effects from SHS exposure
resulted from the 1986 Surgeon General's
report (DHHS 1986), which for the first
time focused on the health risks of SHS, and
also from two influential reports by the
National Research Council (NRC 1986) and
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(U.S. EPA 1992). Both reports concluded
that exposure to SHS causes lung cancer in
nonsmokers and has other adverse effects in
both adults and children. Several subsequent
reports have confirmed and extended this link
between SHS and adverse health effects
(Jaakola and Samet 1999; National Cancer
Institute 1999), which may include cancer,
asthma, respiratory infections, decreased pul-
monary function, and cardiovascular disease.
Despite the increasing awareness that SHS
represents an important public health con-
cern, the extent of the problem was initially
difficult to measure because data on the expo-
sure of nonsmokers were limited and often
depended solely on self-reported exposure or
on inferences, such as living with a smoker,
rather than on direct measurements. However,
objective biomarkers of exposure to tobacco
have been identified and validated (Benowitz
1983, 1996; Jarvis et al. 1988), and an expert
panel convened to review the prospects for
biomarker measurements as an index of SHS
exposure concluded that plasma cotinine was
the marker of choice (Watts et al. 1990).
Cotinine, the primary proximate metabolite
of nicotine, is specific for exposure to tobacco,
and it is preferred as a marker over nicotine
itself partly because the half-life of cotinine in
the body of about 18 hr (Benowitz 1983;
Jarvis et al. 1988) is much longer than that
of nicotine. Serum cotinine can mark the
exposure of an individual to tobacco only over
the previous few days, and it is subject to
interindividual variations in the metabolism of
nicotine. However, these limitations are not
substantial drawbacks when comparing mean
values from groups of people, and in a review,
Benowitz (1996) concluded that the evidence
supports cotinine measurements providing "a
valid and quantitative measure of average
human ETS exposure over time."
The first national survey of SHS exposure
of the entire U.S. population based on serum
cotinine measurements was conducted as part
of the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) that cov-
ered the time period of 1988­1994. NHANES
III consisted of two phases, and we previously
reported the results of cotinine measurements
conducted with > 10,000 participants  4 years
of age from phase 1, extending from 1988
through 1991 (Pirkle et al. 1996). Our results
at that time indicated widespread exposure of
the population to tobacco smoke. Overall, 88%
of nonsmokers in the U.S. population in that
study were found to have detectable levels
( 0.050 ng/mL) of cotinine in their blood,
and certain groups of nonsmokers, including
blacks, males, and children, were found to be at
elevated risk of exposure based on their serum
cotinine levels (Pirkle et al. 1996).
After phase 1, additional data were
acquired during the continuation of NHANES
III in phase 2, which extended from 1991
through 1994. No further studies were con-
ducted during 1995­1998, but NHANES
resumed in 1999 and has been continuous
from that time onward, providing a new

The objective of this study was to describe the exposure of nonsmokers in the U.S. population to
secondhand smoke (SHS) using serum cotinine concentrations measured over a period of 14 years,
from October 1988 through December 2002. This study consists of a series of National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) measuring serum cotinine as an index of SHS
exposure of participants. Study participants were individuals representative of the U.S. civilian,
noninstitutionalized population,  4 years of age. We analyzed serum cotinine and interview data
from NHANES obtained during surveys conducted during four distinct time periods. Our results
document a substantial decline of approximately 70% in serum cotinine concentrations in non-
smokers during this period. This decrease was reflected in all groups within the population regard-
less of age, sex, or race/ethnicity. The large decrease that we observed in serum cotinine
concentrations suggests a substantial reduction in the exposure of the U.S. population to SHS
during the 1990s. The exposure of nonsmokers to SHS represents an important public health con-
cern. Our findings suggest that recent public health efforts to reduce such exposures have had an
important effect, although children and non-Hispanic black nonsmokers show relatively higher
levels of serum cotinine. Key words: biomarker, cotinine, environmental tobacco smoke, ETS,

sampling of the U.S. population every 2 years.
Serum cotinine was measured in NHANES
III (1988­1994), in NHANES 1999­2000,
and NHANES 2001­2002. Thus, we now
have acquired data from NHANES for > 10
years that represent exposures after our initial
report from the time period 1988­1991
(Pirkle et al. 1996). We report here the analy-
sis of these data extending from 1988 through
2002, which indicates a decreasing trend in
SHS exposure of nonsmokers in the United
States, most likely reflecting extensive efforts
made by the public health community during
this time to reduce smoking in the home and
the exposure of nonsmokers in public places.
However, our results also indicate that two
groups in the population, blacks and children,
show relatively higher levels of SHS exposure
during this time, suggesting that further work
should provide special focus on these at-risk
groups.
Materials and Methods
NHANES is a survey conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
which is designed to examine a nationally rep-
resentative sample of the U.S. civilian, nonin-
stitutionalized population based on a complex,
stratified, multistage probability cluster sam-
pling design. The protocols included a home
interview followed by a physical examination
in a mobile examination center (MEC). These
studies were approved by the National Center
for Health Statistics Institutional Review
Board, and all subjects (or their parent or
guardian) provided informed consent before
participation. During examination in the
MEC, blood samples were drawn for serum
cotinine analysis from all participants  4 years
of age during NHANES III, and from partici-
pants  3 years of age in subsequent surveys.
However, to maintain comparability among
surveys in our present analyses, we have
included only participants  4 years of age in
each study interval.
NHANES III consisted of two phases,
phase 1 extending from 1988 to 1991, and
phase 2 from 1991 through 1994. In 1999,
NHANES began operation on a continual
basis, providing a new sampling of the U.S.
population every 2 years. The data reported
here were acquired during NHANES III,
phases 1 and 2, and in NHANES 1999­2000
and NHANES 2001­2002. Thus, they cover
four distinct intervals within an overall time
period of 14 years, from 1988 through 2002.
Participants. Nonsmokers were defined in
this study as persons whose serum cotinine
concentration was  10 ng/mL. Previous com-
parisons in NHANES III demonstrated little
difference when cutoffs of either 10 or
15 ng/mL were used (Pirkle et al. 1996).
Race/ethnicity of the participants based on
self-report was categorized as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
or other. The race/ethnicity category of "other"
was included in mean and percentile estimates
for the total population, but not in the regres-
sion models when race was included as a
covariate. Age was the age in years at the time
of interview. A total of 29,849 participants
were included in this study.
Cotinine analysis. We measured serum
cotinine by a high-performance liquid chro-
matography/atmospheric-pressure ionization
tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)
method that has been described previously
(Bernert et al. 1997, 2000). Briefly, serum
samples were equilibrated with a trideuterated
cotinine internal standard and then extracted
using ChemElute columns (Varian, Harbor
City, CA), concentrated, and analyzed by
LC/MS/MS using atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization. The limit of detection
(LOD) for most of these analyses was 0.050
ng/mL in serum, and we periodically evalu-
ated the results to assure that sensitivity at this
level was maintained. However, as a result of
continuing method improvements, including
the introduction of a newer, more sensitive
mass spectrometer, the LOD was lowered to
0.015 ng/mL during the analysis of samples
from NHANES 2001­2002. Approximately
85% of the samples from 2001­2002 were
analyzed using the newer, more sensitive
LOD. For comparison, we also analyzed the
2001­2002 samples using an LOD of 0.050
ng/mL and found little difference in estimates
for means and percentiles.
This LC/MS/MS method for serum coti-
nine has been continuously maintained in a
single laboratory at the CDC and has analyzed
NHANES samples collected since 1988. Both
bench and blind serum pools are routinely
included with each analytic run as part of the
quality assurance program for this method,
and additional pools spiked with known
amounts of cotinine perchlorate are analyzed
periodically to confirm both precision and
accuracy of the assay. Because of ongoing
improvements in the methodology and
because of the potential for monitoring popu-
lation trends in exposure, we have made a par-
ticular effort to assure continuity, stability,
and uniformity in our analyses over an
extended time period. As part of that effort,
residual samples are retained from older serum
quality control pools when new pools are pre-
pared, and aliquots of the older pools are peri-
odically reexamined to help confirm stability
of the method. We have previously noted that
serum cotinine is stable when stored at ­60°C
(Bernert et al. 2000). Three pools at levels of
0.268 ng/mL, 1.86 ng/mL, and 207 ng/mL
have been measured periodically from 1990
through 2004 in this manner, and those data
confirmed that no systematic drift has
occurred in our measurement of serum coti-
nine during this time.
Statistical methods. All regression models
were fitted using SUDAAN PROC REGRESS
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC). All analyses incorporated sampling
weights that adjusted for unequal probabilities
of selection. The log of serum cotinine was
used as the dependent variable because of the
log-normal distribution of serum cotinine that
has been previously described (Pirkle et al.
1996). Separate models were fitted for each
time period. For each of the models, the follow-
ing independent variables were used: sex (males,
females), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic whites,
non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans), and
age group (4­11, 12­19 and  20 years).
Initial models also included all possible two-
way interactions. Geometric means computed
for each age group, race/ethnicity, and sex were
adjusted for all other variables in each model.
Changes over time were evaluated by using a
two-tailed t-test to compare model adjusted
means of the log-transformed results for the
periods 1988­1991 and 1999­2002. The
degrees of freedom and SEs for these tests cor-
respond to those associated with the model-
adjusted means. In all cases, a null hypothesis
probability level of  5% was taken to indicate
statistical significance.
Results
Figure 1 shows the geometric mean [and 95%
confidence interval (CI)] for serum cotinine
concentrations in the U.S. population of
nonusers of tobacco over the time period
1988­2002. The four time periods included
in this and subsequent figures are 1988­1991,
1991­1994, 1999­2000, and 2001­2002;
the data in Figure 1 are plotted at the approx-
imate midpoint of each interval. These data
demonstrate a consistent decrease over time,
with a decline of approximately 70% observed
between the first and last survey periods. In
NHANES III, phase 1, nearly all nonsmokers
(88%) had concentrations of cotinine

for U.S. nonsmokers by study interval: exposure of

midpoint for four separate time intervals: 1988­1991

1996), a proportion that decreased to 80% in
NHANES III, phase 2. The proportion of the
population with cotinine concentrations
 0.050 ng/mL further decreased to 51% in
NHANES 1999­2000 and to 43% in
NHANES 2001­2002.
Trends in the adjusted geometric mean
cotinine concentrations (adjusted for age, race,
and sex) for the population subdivided by age
and race/ethnicity are given in Figure 2, by
race/ethnicity and sex in Figure 3, and by age
and sex in Figure 4. We evaluated changes over
time by using t-tests to compare model-
adjusted geometric means for time periods
1988­1991 with those for 1999­2002 (results
not shown). Because sex × age and race × age
interactions were present in those models for
one or both time periods, we examined con-
trasts between the two time periods separately
for each sex/age category and for each race/age
category. A significant decrease in serum coti-
nine was observed comparing 1988­1991 with
1999­2002 for each sex/age and race/age cate-
gory except for non-Hispanic whites 4­11 years
of age (p = 0.066).
In general, cotinine concentrations in each
survey were significantly higher in children than
in adults among both non-Hispanic whites and
non-Hispanic blacks. Mexican Americans were
an exception, however, for which children's
values were not significantly higher than those
of adults in any of the time intervals (Figure 2).
Serum cotinine levels in NHANES also clearly
differed by race/ethnicity. During each time
period, the order for adjusted mean cotinine
concentrations remained Mexican American
< non-Hispanic white < non-Hispanic black,
although the mean levels for Mexican-
American and non-Hispanic white nonsmokers
were not significantly different in the most
recent (2001­2002) time period. Non-
Hispanic blacks had mean cotinine concentra-
tions significantly higher than those of either
Mexican Americans or non-Hispanic whites
during each time interval. The only exception
was for non-Hispanic whites 4­11 years of age,
for whom the difference from non-Hispanic
blacks approached but did not achieve statistical
significance (p = 0.059).
Figure 4 summarizes results by age and
sex. A modest difference by sex was noted
among adults  20 years of age, with men hav-
ing significantly higher mean serum cotinine
concentrations than did women in each time
interval. Cotinine levels were also slightly
higher in male adolescents (12­19 years of
age) in every case, but those differences were
not statistically significant. This pattern was
reversed among the younger children in the
4­11 age group, with girls having consistently
higher mean serum cotinine levels than did
boys, although again, the differences were
small and were not significant.
Percentiles for serum cotinine in non-
smokers in three main age groups are given in
Table 1. Median concentrations tended to be
higher among children and adolescents in each
interval, with the greatest differences between
adults  20 years of age versus younger partici-
pants. In addition, the decreases in concentra-
tions from 1988 to 2002 were much less
evident among individuals with the greatest
exposure. Among adults, levels denoting the
95th percentile decreased only about 40%
during this time, whereas the 95th percentile
values among children and adolescents
remained virtually unchanged throughout the
entire period from 1988 through 2002.
Similar results were seen for the most highly
exposed individuals among non-Hispanic
blacks, where again the 90th and 95th per-
centiles showed little decrease for the entire
time period from 1988 to 2002 (Table 2).
Discussion
Comparison of nonsmoker serum cotinine
concentrations acquired from NHANES over
a period of 14 years clearly demonstrates a
substantial decline, averaging approximately

70% overall, during this time. This decrease in
serum cotinine concentrations suggests a
substantial reduction in the exposure of the
U.S. population to SHS over this period. For
example, during NHANES III, approximately
65% of nonsmokers had serum cotinine con-
centrations > 0.1 ng/mL (DHHS 2000b). On
that basis, a Healthy People 2010 objective
was established stating that, by the year 2010,
no more than 45% of nonsmokers should
have cotinine levels > 0.1 ng/mL (DHHS
2000c). Our present results suggest that this
goal was met during 1999­2000. However,
children and non-Hispanic blacks had consis-
tently higher serum cotinine concentrations
than did other segments of the population and
thus remain at relatively elevated risk from
exposure to SHS.
The most likely explanations for this
decrease in serum cotinine concentrations are
the increased restrictions on smoking that
have been widely instituted at work and in
other public places during this time period,
and further efforts to reduce the exposure of
nonsmokers in the home. Using data from
the Current Population Survey, Shopland
et al. (2001) found that between 1993 and
1999 the percentage of indoor workers
reporting smoke-free policies in the workplace
increased from less than 46% to nearly 70%.
In 1993, only two states had at least 60% of
indoor workers reporting that smoke-free
policies were in place; by 1999, 47 states (and
the District of Columbia) had at least that
level of coverage. In general, women reported
more workplace smoke-free policies than did
men, although the sex difference narrowed
somewhat by 1999. Smoke-free workplaces
are also known to contribute to a reduction in
smoking prevalence among workers (Farrelly
et al. 1999; Fichtenberg and Glantz 2002).
Increases in smoke-free policies and reduc-
tions in smoking prevalence may both have
contributed to the decline in exposure of non-
smokers to SHS. The role of restrictions,
however, is presumably more important
because the prevalence of adult smoking in
the United States did not decrease substan-
tially during the 1990s: between 1990 and
1999, the national median decreased only
slightly from 25.5% to 22.7% (CDC 2000).
In general, smoke-free environmental policies
are regarded as the most effective means of
reducing exposure to SHS (Task Force on
Community Preventive Services 2001).
Certain subgroups, when characterized by
age, sex, or race/ethnicity, had consistently
higher cotinine concentrations during each
time period. A major source of SHS exposure
in young children is from parents or other
adults smoking at home, and exposure of non-
smokers to SHS in homes with children also
declined during the 1990s. Comparing data
from the 1992 and 2000 National Health
Interview Surveys, Soliman et al. (2004)
found that reported SHS exposure declined
from 36% to approximately 25%, more than
would be expected from declines in adult
smoking prevalence alone. This decrease
occurred across all groups, although home
SHS exposures remained most prevalent
among non-Hispanic whites in that study, and
we found that cotinine concentrations were
higher in non-Hispanic children than in
adults during all NHANES survey periods.
In the present study, Mexican-American
nonsmokers generally had lower serum cotinine
levels than did the other two race/ethnicity
groups, whereas mean serum cotinine concen-
trations in non-Hispanic blacks were consis-
tently higher in each time period. The higher
cotinine concentrations found in non-Hispanic
blacks presumably reflect greater exposure to
SHS within this population, although the inter-
pretation of these results is complicated by pos-
sible metabolic influences. Among active
smokers, blacks have consistently higher serum
cotinine concentrations per cigarette smoked
than do whites (Caraballo et al. 1998;
Wagenknecht et al. 1990), and this has been
attributed, at least in part, to differences
between blacks and whites in the metabolism of
nicotine, cotinine, and their glucuronides
(Benowitz et al. 1999). Thus, metabolic factors
might also account for at least part of the eth-
nic/racial differences seen in serum cotinine lev-
els among nonsmokers. In a study of children
with asthma, Wilson et al. (2005) reported
finding significantly higher serum cotinine con-
centrations for African-American children even
after adjusting for self-reported SHS exposure.
However, Wagenknecht et al. (1993) found
that SHS exposure assessed by either self-report
or serum cotinine measurements among 3,300
nonsmokers in the CARDIA study was signifi-
cantly higher for blacks than for whites, but

Trends in U.S. secondhand smoke exposure

that the difference in serum cotinine did not
persist after adjustment for self-reported
exposure to SHS. Sexton et al. (2004) also
found that questionnaires, time­activity data,
and cotinine measurements all indicated higher
SHS exposure among African-American chil-
dren. Thus, the consistently higher serum coti-
nine levels for black nonsmokers in NHANES
appear to reflect higher SHS exposure,
although the extent to which differences in
metabolism may confound these estimates
remains uncertain.
Exposure of nonsmokers to SHS also
appears to have declined in other countries
besides the United States during this time
period, at least based on self-report. For
example, Borland et al. (1999) described
annual surveys of approximately 2,500 adults
conducted in Victoria, Australia, from 1989
to 1997. The percentage of respondents
reporting that they did not smoke in the pres-
ence of children and that visitors were dis-
couraged from smoking in the home both
approximately doubled during this time. In
addition, the percentage of indoor workers in
Victoria protected by restrictions on smoking
in the workplace increased from 17% to 66%
between 1988 and 1995. Within 1 year after
Finland passed its Tobacco Control Act in
1995 prohibiting smoking in the workplace
in all joint and public premises, workers
reporting no ETS exposure in the workplace
increased almost 3-fold, from 19.2% to
54.2% (Heloma et al. 2001).
Most studies finding decreased exposure
to SHS over time have relied on self-reports.
However, Jarvis et al. (2000) have reported a
substantial decrease during the 1990s in the
exposure of British school children to SHS as
assessed by salivary cotinine measurements.
They monitored secondary school children
11­15 years of age from 1988 through 1996
and found that their salivary cotinine levels
decreased by almost 50% during that time.
They attributed the decline to both the
decrease in prevalence of smoking among
young adults with children and the increased
restrictions in Great Britain on smoking in
public places. However, Jarvis et al. (2000)
found only small declines among children
whose parents smoked, suggesting that cessa-
tion rather than smokers simply avoiding
exposure of children in the home was the pri-
mary factor driving the decline.
Our study has several strengths and some
limitations. The data were taken from several
large surveys conducted over a period of 14
years, evaluating national samples of individuals
who were representative of the entire U.S. civil-
ian, noninstitutionalized population, and
included a total of nearly 30,000 nonsmokers.
We used a sensitive and specific method for
serum cotinine analysis, and all assays were con-
ducted under uniform and rigorously con-
trolled conditions. Repetitive analyses of com-
mon samples over time confirmed the absence
of any unusual variations or drift in the analytic
method. Thus, the substantial decreases in
serum cotinine we observed over time most
likely reflect corresponding decreases in expo-
sure of nonsmokers to SHS. Nevertheless,
serum cotinine has limitations as an exposure
marker because it can monitor exposures only
over the previous few days, and because nico-
tine metabolic differences among groups may
influence the concentrations observed.
However, despite the relatively short half-life
of cotinine, measures of central tendency
among groups based on large numbers of indi-
viduals should provide reasonable estimates of
group steady-state levels. Although the differ-
ences we observed among ethnic/racial groups
most likely reflect differences in exposure,
metabolic influences cannot be excluded, and
additional work is needed to evaluate the rela-
tive contributions of exposure and metabo-
lism. Finally, a few occasional smokers could
possibly have been included inadvertently
among the more highly exposed participants
in our study, because some infrequent smokers
may have serum cotinine levels < 10 ng/mL.
This factor is unlikely to have been significant
among adults, and it is even less likely to have
been influential among young children
because few children in the 4­11 age group
are active smokers.
Conclusion
Serum cotinine concentrations among non-
smokers in the U.S. population declined sig-
nificantly during the 1990s. This decrease was
found in all groups within the population and
probably reflects the substantial progress
made in reducing the exposure of nonsmokers
to SHS during this time. Nevertheless, chil-
dren and non-Hispanic blacks continue to
show relatively higher serum cotinine concen-
trations, suggesting that these two groups in
particular should be the focus of increased
intervention efforts, and that additional work
is needed to further encourage restrictions on
smoking in the home, automobiles, and other
locations when children are present.
