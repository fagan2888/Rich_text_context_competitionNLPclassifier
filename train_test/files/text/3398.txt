Introduction
. . . with technology changing, now you got newspaper
companies doing the same thing as TV stations, so there are
many one-man-bands where newspapers are doing it and placing
those stories on the website it's, all part of media today.
(Respondent 1, personal communication, March 16, 2013)
Respondent 1's (R1) statement echoes through current
broadcast journalism literature (Hu, 2012; Powers, 2010;
Wyss, 2009). Today's broadcast journalist must be an equally
strong writer, videographer, editor, and on-air talent (Hu,
2012; Powers, 2010; Wyss, 2009). This "one-person-band"
approach to broadcast journalism is a new phenomenon. Ten
years ago, a journalist was expected to specialize. For exam-
ple, a journalist generally would work as an on-air reporter or
a cameraperson, but seldom would one professional take on
both duties. Today, shrinking budgets and new technology
have forced reporters to become camera operators and cam-
era operators to become reporters. The reality of modern
journalism is, to be employable; one must be a master of all
broadcast crafts.
The training of future journalists is, in part, the responsi-
bility of the journalism instructor (JI). In the current era of
broadcast production, post-secondary Mass Communication
(MC) Departments face a new challenge. Wyss (2009) wrote,
". . . besides the lessons of who, what, when, where, why and
how are others in interactivity, multimedia, blogs, Twitter,
Facebook, and wikis" (p. 26). Wyss's statement addresses
the need for JIs to train students using the latest technology
in a quickly changing broadcast profession.
Wyss's (2009) comments illustrate an issue MC depart-
ments across the United States must understand. That prob-
lem is developing a modern, affordable, and comprehensive
broadcast journalism curriculum. Modern journalists must
understand how to produce news in a society where enter-
tainment is increasingly valued over information, where
social media is as important as traditional media, and where
journalism teams have been replaced with the one-person-
band (Mensing, 2010; Potter, 2012). As the list of changes
and challenges to traditional journalism instruction continues
to increase, MC departments at the post-secondary level are

Abstract
There is a friendly conflict between field broadcast journalists and broadcast journalism instructors. The conflict centers on
the development of best instructional practices for the student journalists. This qualitative study is an attempt to bridge the
gap between field journalists and journalism instructors. To accomplish this goal, first, a review of the academic literature
was conducted to establish a research base. Then, interviews were conducted with field broadcast journalists (n = 4) to
answer the following guiding research question: According to field broadcast journalists, what knowledge, skills, and training
are required when transitioning from MC student into professional broadcast journalist? This study presents the findings of
these interviews. Areas of focus are technology, internships, and student motivation. The study concludes with a discussion
of academic advisory groups. However, the ultimate goal of the study is to get the two groups talking rather than scowling
at each other from across the news desk.

faced with a daunting task. That task and the problem this
article will address is developing a broadcast journalism cur-
riculum that reflects changes at the professional level.
Statement of purpose. The purpose of this article is to report
the specific technologies and skills field broadcast journal-
ists (FBJ) claim to be critical additions/updates to a post-
secondary MC department's curriculum. The suggested
curricular updates reflect ideal best instructional practices to
prepare students for the transition from student into a profes-
sional broadcast journalist. Issues raised and suggestions
provided are developed from current broadcast literature, site
visits to news stations/production houses, and discussions
with practicing journalists. This article has three areas of
focus: (a) technology, (b) hands-on learning and internships,
and (c) student motivation. While one article cannot serve to
update an entire curriculum, this study can be viewed as an
opportunity to begin the conversation between FBJs and
post-secondary MC departments.
Conceptual framework. This study builds on the academic lit-
erature calling to revolutionize and revitalize broadcast jour-
nalism departments. Articles by Curry (2010), Mensing
(2010), Powers (2010), and others call for broadcast journal-
ism departments through teaching, technology, and out-of-
classmentoring,totrainstudentstobecomecommunity-based
journalists with a global understanding. That is to say, stu-
dents need to understand the importance of reporting local
news, but they must understand how that local news relates
to and is part of global events.
To illustrate the global nature of community-based sto-
ries, Hu (2012) declared that broadcasting is the beginning of
a news story's lifecycle. Webcasting and social media, in
other words, can continually rebroadcast the story and add
relevant information, making a community-based story glob-
ally relevant. An example of this is the tragic death of an
Iranian protester named Neda Agha-Soltan. On June 20,
2009, Iranian police shot and killed Agha-Soltan as she
peacefully protested in Tehran, Iran (Fathi, 2009). Neda's
tragic death was captured on cell phones, transmitted through
social media, and eventually reported in traditional mass
media outlets.
Once broadcast through traditional mass media, the story
took on a new life. Rest in peace (RIP) Neda videos appeared
on YouTube and social media sites dedicated to her regis-
tered followers from around the world. Furthermore, to the
dismay of many, webcasts of the shooting were shared/
rebroadcast from website to website. While Neda's example
of a community event going global is tragic, it is not unique.
Today, all journalism is a global story.
Statement of problem. There is a problem facing post-secondary
MC departments. That problem, specifically, post-secondary
MC departments across the United States are unsure of the
best teaching strategies and technologies required to prepare
post-secondary students to compete for employment in the
broadcast industry (Claussen, 2011; Hu, 2012; Powers,
2012). An FBJ interviewed for this article suggested, "So
you got to be ready to go and know your job, as well as to
know others in this fields, because you never know what
situation you are going into" (Respondent 1, personal com-
munication, March 16, 2013). R1's statement rings through-
out the literature and also through the comments of other
FBJs interviewed for this article.
Significance of study.A study, such as this one, is necessary
because few broadcast journalism departments routinely dis-
cuss curricular matters with broadcast practitioners. Articles
written about broadcast journalism curricular updates origi-
nate from academics. Furthermore, the works cited in those
academic articles reference other academics.
FBJs work with students graduating from MC programs.
Through observation and industry experience, FBJs can
identify strengths and weaknesses of recently graduated stu-
dents. The ability to work with and observe recent graduates
places FBJs in a unique position to critique the work of post-
secondary MC departments.
The few articles that do highlight the FBJ's perspective
ignore broadcast journalism literature. This conceptual report
adds to the current literature by combining FBJs'suggestions
with concepts from broadcast journalism literature. This
combination is put forward not only to develop a set of sug-
gested practices for a modern broadcast MC department but
also to encourage post-secondary MC departments to open
lines of communication with local broadcast media.
Research question. A primary goal of any post-secondary MC
program is to graduate students who are ready to compete in
the broadcast production job market. With rapid change
occurring in communication information systems, technol-
ogy and production practices broadcast journalism depart-
ments must determine best curricular practices to aid
broadcast journalism students' transition into professional
journalism. To determine best practices, this report will con-
sider both the academic literature and interviews conducted
with FBJs when answering the guiding research question:
Research Question 1: According to field broadcast jour-
nalists, what knowledge, skills, and training are required
when transitioning from MC student into professional
broadcast journalist?

Literature Review
Changes in broadcast journalism.In the field of broadcast
journalism instruction, what was current and acceptable to
teach 5 years ago is now outdated. A few years ago, the pres-
ence of social media sites, such as YouTube, Twitter, and
Taylor and Maxwell 3
Facebook, had little impact on day-to-day journalism. Before
2011, training student journalists to communicate through
social media was considered little more than a lecture side
note. Furthermore, equipment such as high-definition video
cameras, media capture technology, and editing software
were comparatively expensive before 2011. Today, for
example, most consumer-grade smartphones capture high-
definition video. Before 2011, high-definition video capture
required a video camera costing US$7000.00 or more. A
broadcast journalism department that developed a 5-year
plan in 2011 may find itself quickly into an outdated
curriculum.
While the above statements may "feel" correct, the aca-
demics reading this document may scream, "Where is the
support?" In fact, the academic literature is active concern-
ing the discussion of broadcast journalism evolution at both
the industry and academic levels. Articles printed in trade
magazines regularly announce declining news budgets
(Arden, 2009; Mangan, 2009). Along with reduced budgets,
discussions are held in the trade literature about new tech-
niques for broadcasting. For example, reporting through
social media is a common theme (Stevenson & Peck, 2011;
Walejko, 2010). Mixed in with these discussions are calls for
the revamping of the broadcast journalism curriculum (Hu,
2012; Mensing, 2010; Wyss, 2009).
Journalism:working professionals versus journalism instructors.There
has been a long-standing conflict between FBJs and JIs. Du
and Thornburg (2011) claim that the differences of opinion
date back to at least the 1990s. Both sides of the debate pro-
vide valid points (to be discussed below). The result of this
conflict, however, is a lack of communication between FBJs
and JIs (Benigni et al., 2011; Du & Thornburg, 2011). This
lack of communication has caused the education of student
journalists to suffer because FBJs do not often communicate
necessary job skills to JIs. When an FBJdoes reach out to an
MC department, she or he finds few listening.
Point of view: field broadcast journalists. FBJs emphasize prac-
tice over theory. These journalists believe that courses in
media theory, communication studies, and so on are ulti-
mately a waste of students' time (Benigni et al., 2011;
Mensing, 2010; Du & Thornburg, 2011). According to the
literature, FBJs believe that students need training in the
skills of writing for broadcast, capturing a story through the
camera's lens and editing (Mensing, 2010; Du & Thornburg,
2011). All other courses amount to little more than a waste of
students' time and money. FBJs claim theoretical concepts
will become evident to students after they (the students) have
spent some time in the field.
FBJs believe that MC departments keep students in the
classroom far longer than is necessary (Benigni et al., 2011;
Biswas & Izard, 2010; Mensing, 2010; Du & Thornburg,
2011). Furthermore, FBJs often feel that JIs have been out of
the newsroom for too long. JIs, according to the FBJs, are out
of touch with modern concepts and technology (Du &
Thornburg, 2011).
Point of view of academic journalists. JIs realize that fieldwork
is crucial but argue that a college education is about more
than training on equipment and technical skills. This group
of journalists insists theory must accompany technical train-
ing (Benigni et al., 2011). JIs argue they are preparing stu-
dents to work in the world after college (Du & Thornburg,
2011). In fact, studies show only 25% of MC graduates move
on to the newsroom (Flamm, 2013). The above statistic illus-
trates that the majority of MC students must be ready to work
in other areas of the workforce. Also, theory must be taught
to prepare those students who can continue to graduate
school. JIs' arguments on this topic may be summed up as
follows: JIs are not in the business of training students to be
technicians working in a newsroom. Rather, the JI is teaching
students concepts that will transform them (the students) into
productive citizens of the world.
Strong points on both sides. Clearly both sides have strong
points. JIs can be resistant to change. This resistance can lead
to coursework that ignores modern practices and technolo-
gies. When modern practices and technologies are ignored,
students may not graduate fully prepared to work in the
broadcast field. FBJs, however, must be willing to concede
that a post-secondary education is about more than instilling
technical knowledge.
When a student hangs a post-secondary MC diploma on
his or her wall, certain assumptions can be made about the
knowledge of that student. An MC diploma represents more
than an education in practice and drill exercises. Rather, an
MC diploma represents the completion of courses in media
law and ethics, media history, communication theory, and
other scholarly courses of thought. The JI, therefore, would
argue that an MC graduate is not merely a video technician.
Rather, the JI may claim the MC graduate is a well-rounded
media scholar.

Method
The purpose of this study is to bridge the disconnect in com-
munication between FBJs and higher education MC depart-
ments. To achieve this goal, first, the academic literature was
scoured for discussions concerning the FBJs' influence
toward MC departments' curriculum. After searching the lit-
erature, FBJs were consulted. Consultations with the FBJs
were conducted in the form of semi-structured interviews.
The research design for this study was naturalistic inquiry.
The naturalistic inquiry paradigm. The naturalistic paradigm is
a method of investigation in which the researcher becomes
immersed in the subject matter (Erlandson, Harris, Skipper,
4 SAGE Open
& Allen, 1993). That is to say, the researcher meets and inter-
views people who have deep knowledge of the subject mat-
ter. Furthermore, in naturalistic inquiry, the researcher spends
time in the research setting. During time in setting, the
researcher observes how participants interact with their sur-
roundings and with other people. The result of these interac-
tions will be findings that hold thick description (Lincoln &
Guba, 1985). To achieve time in setting, the lead researcher
conducted site visits to television news studios, local televi-
sion stations, and video production studios. Interviews were
conducted with experienced broadcast professionals.
Axioms.Lincoln and Guba (1985) outline five axioms that
define natural inquiry. While each of the axioms guided this
article, one axiom worked as a focusing concept. That axiom
is Axiom 4, The Possibility of Causal Linkage.
Axiom 4, The Possibility of Causal Linkage, states,
according to Lincoln and Guba (1985), all entities are in a
state of mutual simultaneous shaping so that it is impossible
to distinguish causes from effects. Axiom 4 holds promi-
nence in this article because it illustrates the unbreakable
relationship between broadcast journalism as a profession
and broadcast journalism as a higher education curriculum.
A goal of broadcast journalism instruction is to train stu-
dents to work as broadcast professionals. Changes at the pro-
fessional level should influence change at the high education
level. In turn, students graduating from college should bring
new ideas into the professional ranks. Thus, each group
influences and shapes the other.
Axiom 4 illustrates the importance of an article such as
this one. There is an unbreakable bond between broadcast
journalism as a profession and as a higher education course
of study. When communication between these two groups is
limited, the flow of information is affected. This lack of com-
munication can lead to students being less prepared to enter
the professional ranks and fewer innovative ideas being
transmitted from universities into the broadcast profession.
Data collection.
Interviews were conducted in a semi-
structured format. A semi-structured interview, according to
Erlandson et al. (1993) is ". . . guided by a set of basic ques-
tions and issues to be explored, but neither the exact wording
nor order of the questions is predetermined" (p. 86). This
structure allowed the lead researcher to explore concepts
brought up by the broadcast professionals. For example, the
majority of interviewees discussed the concept of intense
internships. The semi-structured interview format allowed
for questions such as, "How would you develop an intern-
ship?" or "What skills should an internship reinforce or
teach?"
Questions for each interview originated from an institu-
tional review board (IRB)­approved list. A sample question
from the approved list is, "What surprises you most about
students currently graduating from MC departments?" The
approved list of questions served as initial probes into the
broadcast professionals' views. For questions/concepts
where deeper inquiry was needed, the lead researcher asked
to follow up or clarify questions not included on the approved
list. Clarifying questions were approved through IRB pro-
cess as a method of inquiry.
Data analysis. Interviews for this report were conducted dur-
ing the months of March and April 2013. Each interview was
tape-recorded for transcribing and coding purposes. Partici-
pants were made aware of the recording and asked to
acknowledge and approve recoding of the interviews (Lin-
coln & Guba, 1985).
Participants.For this study, four broadcast professionals
were interviewed. To qualify as a "broadcast professional,"
participants must earn (at the time of the interview) their liv-
ing working in the broadcast industry. For this study, employ-
ment in the broadcast industry is defined as work that
contributes to the production and broadcast, through a mass
medium, of newscasts, documentaries or other on-air live or
pre-recorded productions. Below is a description of each par-
ticipant's professional qualifications as experts for this study:
R1: R1 has worked in the broadcast profession for more
than 20 years. R1 began working as a part-time photogra-
pher for news stations throughout South Texas. R1 has
also worked as a news editor and segment producer.
Currently, R1 is employed as the video producer for a
South Texas university. In this capacity, R1 shoots and
edits news stories and documentaries relating to the post-
secondary. R1 also works production contracts several
times a month. As a contract videographer/editor, R1 has
worked with the National Basketball Association­
Development League (DNBA), National Basketball
Association (NBA), Texas high school football, and other
sporting events. Beyond sports, R1 has shot and edited
documentaries and live multi-cam events for music acts
across the United States and Mexico. R1 has worked
directly with acts such as Mana, Los Lobos, Jennifer
Lopez, Eva Longoria, and several others.
R2: R2 has worked in the broadcast profession for more
than 20 years. The first professional job R2 held was as a
news photographer for various stations in the California/
Nevada area. Throughout the years, R2 as worked as a
news editor, writer, and newscast producer. Currently, R2
works primarily as a producer for a government access
station in a large southwestern U.S. city. In this capacity,
R2 works several hours each week with local and national
news stations.
R3: R3 began a broadcast career in the mid-1990s. R3's
first job was master control operator for a South Texas
news station. From master control, R3 was promoted to
news photographer, editor, and eventually executive news
producer. Currently, R3 works as a videographer/editor
for a South Texas city government television station.
Taylor and Maxwell 5
R4: R4 graduated with a degree in broadcast journalism
from a medium size Texas post-secondary in 2011. After
graduation, R4 began working, at the national level, as a
master control operator/videographer for the news depart-
ment of a Spanish-language broadcast outlet. Currently,
R4 works as a writer/videographer/editor/producer for a
medium sized city access channel in South Texas.
Chapter 4
Findings
Technology.With advancements in technology have come
new responsibilities for the professional broadcast journalist.
R1 stated,
. . . the times have changed, lot, back in the day if you were a
videographer you carried your camera and your audio on the
side. And, nowadays you have those one-man bands where a lot
of stations are going. Which means you run audio, which means
you are a videographer, which means you are in charge of audio,
which means you have to carry out of all these items with you
and know how to use them because you know what you use is
not going to wait for you. (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,
March 16, 2012)
R4 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,
2013) illustrates the extent to which technology has changed
since 2010: "You know when I started, we used digital tape,
video cameras . . . Then we moved into the SD cards. And
that was a big change." R1 and R4 illustrate the need for
post-secondary MC departments, instructors, and ultimately
students to keep up with changing technology.
Technology take away
What universities are doing right.Broadcast technol-
ogy, as mentioned previously in this report, is in a state of
rapid change. Adapting to the constant technology updates
is expensive. Each of the FBJs interviewed for this report
recognize that fact and applaud universities for incorporat-
ing technological changes as quickly as possible. R2 (N.
T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013) stated,
"I have seen education adapting. Maybe not as fast as the
broadcasters but that's because it's so expensive." R1 fur-
ther supported the efforts of post-secondary instructors by
stating,
. . . if your division is not going to support you, not buy you one
of the 15,000 or $18,000 cameras because there are $3000
cameras what are you going to do? You do the best you can with
what you have. But it's not teaching them that full experience.
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, March 21, 2013).
According to the interviews for this report, JIs are knowl-
edgeable concerning current broadcast industry standard
equipment.
Where universities can improve.During the interviews,
the FBJs expressed that universities are not fully preparing
students to work in the world of broadcast journalism. The
basics need to be stressed throughout classes. Throughout
the interviews, the FBJs lamented students lack proficiency
in writing, videography, and editing. R3 noted, "I don't think
they're trained. They just don't seem ready for the world"
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). R4
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013) com-
mented,
One thing I should've learned or wish we learned more about
was presentation. How to stand in front of the camera, do stand-
ups. What are the step-by-step's what is the process, voice tone,
where to stand. I didn't learn all that. I wish I had. Plus things
like white balance things like iris I think we need to do more of
that. (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013)
Knowing how to execute basic videography and broad-
cast storytelling techniques are the skills that aid a student in
the transition into professional broadcaster. While most post-
secondary MC departments offer courses that instruct in vid-
eography skills, there is obviously an issue with students
retaining instructed information.
That is to say, the students are not well rounded in the
skills of writing, shooting, and editing. R2 (N. T. Taylor, per-
sonal communication, April 20, 2013) stated,
. . . writing, I don't see enough real-world, extensive experience.
They don't get enough. Well, you got to know how to write fast
and accurate. In news, you have hourly deadlines. Also, I've
given my interns some opportunities to shoot and, I have say, "I
haven't been impressed." Just the basics they seem to have
troubles with. Things like how long you hold your shot,
sequencing when to pan when to tilt, not letting the camera
jiggle.
R1 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, March 21,
2013) added to the conversation by stating, ". . . what helped
me be in this career was the hands-on learning in high school.
I mean by the time I went in I already knew what I was going
to face because I have that hands-on learning." The FBJs'
statements were repeated throughout the interviews. Each of
the interviews indicated that students needed more practice
with videography and broadcast storytelling. So, although
universities are stocking industry standard (or near) equip-
ment, according to the FBJs, the schools are not utilizing the
equipment. That is to say, the schools have the equipment,
but the students are not gaining enough practical experience
with the technology.
Technology purchases.When considering equipment pur-
chases for a post-secondary broadcast journalism department,
the temptation will be to buy less expensive, smaller gear.
That temptation arises because the equipment can capture
broadcast quality images and sound at a low cost. The fact is
6 SAGE Open
that small high-definition (HD) cameras, inexpensive micro-
phones, and free editing software do not prepare students for
work in professional broadcast agencies.
Broadcast organizations utilize professional grade equip-
ment. The news stations expect new hires to understand how
to use that equipment. Furthermore, it is important to note
that news stations still utilize studio cameras controlled
through servos on full pedestals. News stations utilize multi-
ple brands of editing software. However, free software, such
as iMovie, was not seen in use during research for this study.
The following are suggestions for equipment purchases:
Cameras purchased need to have manual white-balance
and iris functions.
HD cameras need to shoot to media card, only. Tape is no
longer utilized.
Students need to learn how to connect various pieces of
equipment together. So, XLR, VGA, SDI, BNC, HDMI, and so
on cables must be available and utilized during coursework.
Live production hardware and software, such as the
NewTek TriCaster, will train students for work in modern
production houses.
Editing software must be current.
Access to web-connected computers is necessary.
One-person band.Universities need to teach the one-
person-band approach to journalism. Many students walk
into post-secondary broadcast studio with dreams of becom-
ing an anchor. Those dreams are valid and achievable. How-
ever, in the modern news station to achieve the dream of
becoming an anchor, students must first master other broad-
cast technologies and skills. R3 made this point by stating,
The students say I want to be an anchor I want to be a reporter.
Then the producer says here is your gear and the students don't
know what to do it. It's as if they're too good to handle a camera
they are better than to do that. But then these are the times, and
you can't say you are better than that. (N. T. Taylor, personal
communication, April 20, 2013)
In other words, students need to learn all aspects of broad-
casting. Assigning basic camera drills, practicing cable wrap-
ping or teaching about encoding-frame-rates may seem, at first,
like boring, busy work. Those assignments, however, teach
critical tasks. The students will hate the work while in class but
appreciate the knowledge when working at a news station.
The one-person-band approach to journalism, it is impor-
tant to note, is not favored by FBJs. R2 called the one-
person-band approach "A hard pill to swallow" (N. T. Taylor,
personal communication, April 20, 2013). Each of the FBJs
stated that this style of reporting leads to diminished produc-
tion quality and a lowed level of storytelling/fact finding. R3
points out,
I guess it is good, I see where they're coming from saving
money, TV stations. But at the same time you lose the visual
element. Something I have seen a lot happening lately is shaky
video, on standard stand-ups, just stuff you can see this is a one-
person band.You can tell the reporter doesn't know videography
or editing. There are a lot of black holes in the editing. (N. T.
Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013)
Each of the FBJs stated that the one-person-band approach
to storytelling reduces journalistic quality. Perhaps it will be
current post-secondary students who bring back the news
team. Or perhaps it will be current post-secondary students
who perfect the one-person-band concept.
To prepare students for work as professional broadcast
journalists, broadcast journalism departments must stock
professional grade equipment. This equipment is expensive.
However, every FBJ consulted during research for this report
cited student access to professional grade equipment as a key
factor in gaining and keeping employment.
Parting thought on technology. Rapid changes in technol-
ogy make it difficult for broadcast journalism departments to
stock the most current gear. However, broadcast journalism
departments should work to maintain equipment as close to
industry standard as possible. True learning occurs, accord-
ing to the FBJs, when students have access to innovative les-
sons, passionate faculty, and current technology.
Internships and hands-on learning. The idea that students need
to be competent in all areas of production (writing, shoot-
ing, editing) was repeated throughout the interviews. R2
stated, "The technology is seeing huge, huge change. You
have to be able to adapt to change . . ." (N. T. Taylor, per-
sonal communication, April 7, 2012). Throughout the inter-
views, it became clear, as mentioned above, today's
broadcast professionals must have knowledge of profes-
sional grade cameras, modern editing software, plus other
broadcast tools to avoid difficulty in finding employment.
This sentiment is echoed in the literature (Hu, 2012; Pow-
ers, 2010, 2012).
Hands-on learning and intense internships were two sug-
gestions each of the FBJs offered for training students to
become better writers, shooters, and editors. Although many
universities offer both hands-on learning and internships, the
FBJs did not feel the students' education was deep enough in
either area.
Internships.The interviewed FBJs each recognized that
most universities encourage internships. However, through
the interviews, it became clear that internships should be
mandatory rather than encouraged. R1 (N. T. Taylor, per-
sonal communication, March 21, 2013) stated,
In the real world, people are not going to tell you "Go set up this
audio system." Then take you by the hand teaching you how to
do it. They expect you to know how to do it, and when they
come over, everything has to be working.
Taylor and Maxwell 7
R2 also stressed the importance of internships: "The
school should have mandatory internships. Something that is
mandatory for the students to graduate. I don't know how
many schools do that, but I think it would help" (N. T. Taylor,
personal communication, April 20, 2013). Although intern-
ships at the post-secondary level are not uncommon, it is evi-
dent that many FBJs do not believe internships are being
utilized effectively. Each FBJ felt a need to stress the idea
that students could be better trained if internships had greater
prominence in the curriculum.
Hands-on learning. Hands-on learning in the classroom was
also, according to the interviewed FBJs, an area of curricular
weakness. Each of the FBJs stressed the importance of using
broadcast standard equipment during classroom, or lab, exer-
cises. R3 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,
2013) stated, "I mean you're not going to get this without
getting your hands-on equipment. You have to roll cables
you have to learn how to frame a shot with the camera." R2
added to the discussion by stating,
You (the student) need to know how to run the camera there a lot
of buttons there a lot of knobs that you need to know how to
work. It's almost as if you need to be able to run your camera in
a dark room, without looking. (N. T. Taylor, personal
communication, April 20, 2013)
Again, many universities do provide access to cameras,
professional editing software, and so on, but the FBJs believe
that training on real-world assignments is inadequate.
Internships and hands-on-learning take away
What universities are doing right.The FBJs recognized
that post-secondary instructors work hard to include hands-
on learning in class lessons and in helping students find
internships. Furthermore, the FBJs recognized that finding
an internship in today's market is difficult. While discussing
hands-on learning, R2 stated, "The students I've met through-
out the years, I don't feel like they've not had enough experi-
ence in their schooling that they are lost. I can train them"
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). On
the topic of internships, R1 stated, "in reality how much is
there out there for students? There is only so much. Times
are changing we've got to find students who are willing to
work hard and go out and find those internships themselves"
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). Evi-
dently, the FBJs recognize the limitations of both class time
and market internship.
Student motivation.A common complaint about today's stu-
dents is that they are less motivated and lazier than past gen-
erations of broadcast professionals. R1 states, "I know a lot of
students who have the talent but don't want to go out there and
do the work" (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,April 20,
2013). Each of the FBJs interviewed felt that students often
lack passion and a willingness to take on entry-level jobs.
When asked, "What surprises you most about students
today?" R2 commented, "I don't see the same level of pas-
sion today" (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20,
2013). Another comment from R2 illustrates that the issue of
student motivation is not limited to one region or post-
secondary: "We've had students from the post-secondary,
we've had students from the arts institute, and students from
the community college. And they talk a big talk. But, when it
comes down to it they don't want to learn the business" (N.
T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). Pushing
students to become more motivated and passionate about the
hard work of storytelling may be a common topic of conver-
sation among JIs; however, it is unsettling to hear these com-
ments from the FBJs.
Changing times are often cited as the unofficial reason
students seemingly have less passion toward the broadcast
business than past generations. A change in times and tech-
nology may be a reason students seem to have less passion to
learn the craft of broadcast journalism. R3 made a very
insightful comment by stating,
You know back when you and I were students if someone had a
camera you knew they had to be important. Today complete
episodes of web episodes are shot with an iPhone so the days
where being impressed by camera are gone. Well everybody has
a camera, why would anybody be impressed. (N. T. Taylor,
personal communication, April 20, 2013)
R3's comment makes a great deal of sense. Past generations
may have had one to two cameras to share among an entire
post-secondary department and a few editing bays with strict
usage limits. Fewer than 10 years ago, access to industry
standard equipment was severely limited, whereas today, HD
cameras are cheap and plentiful. And editing a project can be
accomplished on most laptops bought at the local big box
store.
R1 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication, March 21,
2013) points to another possible cause for current students'
apparent lack of motivation:
. . . a lot of the students, and you can talk about this in any major,
they don't know if this is what they want to do. They went 3
years into the program and they're getting ready to finish the
following year and they're not really sure what they want to do.
R1's comment may be extended to illustrate a situation that
occurs with many experienced professionals. That is, as a
person gains experience, it is possible to forget the insecurity
and uncertainty of starting down a career path.
Student motivation take away
What universities do right.Current students are not
unmotivated; rather, they are differently motivated. That is
to say what created passion in past generations of students
will not work for today's student. The FBJs interviewed for
8 SAGE Open
this report recognize the hard work broadcast journalism
professors devote to the development of unique and modern
assignments.
R3 was impressed with an assignment given by an instruc-
tor at a South Texas post-secondary. For the assignment, stu-
dents were required to set up, shoot, and direct post-secondary
basketball games. The output was broadcast live on the are-
na's jumbotron and through webcast. Referring to the assign-
ment, R3 stated, ". . . students helping with the games, the
basketball games are important. Helping stream basketball
games and things like that helps them sharpen their skills" (N.
T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). Each of
the FBJs had examples of innovative assignments. The FBJs
noted that innovative assignments build esprit de corps,
understanding of the industry, and motivation to improve.
The FBJs also noted the pride instructors often feel in
their students. Throughout the interviews, FBJs discussed
how hard JIs worked to build confidence within the students.
R1 illustrated the importance of building student confidence
(N. T. Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013):
It's just as an instructor you have to find that thing. And as an
instructor once you find that real strength, he starts changing and
thinking differently because he sees something positive about
himself. And all of a sudden he starts sharing with others. This
automatically becomes a cycle of students motivating each
other.
R2 furthered the discussion by stating, "They (the JIs) are
going to show the cameras, writing, producing. I mean, there
are still many jobs in television and I think the students need
to be encouraged to explore many areas" (N. T. Taylor, per-
sonal communication, April 20, 2013). These comments indi-
cate that JIs are empowering students to take charge of their
(the students) educational and eventually career success.
Where universities can improve. At times, the empower-
ment of students, in the FBJs opinion, should be reined in.
Throughout the interviews, FBJs discussed the unrealistic
expectations of students. R3 stated, "You can see it; out of
school students think they are going to be an anchor. And it
just doesn't happen like that" (N. T. Taylor, personal com-
munication, April 20, 2013). R2 commented, "Students have
a single focus a lot. That is, `I want to be on TV'" (N. T.
Taylor, personal communication, April 20, 2013). While the
goal of becoming a news anchor or reporter is noble, current
students seem to have lost sight of an important fact. That fact
is, before being employed as an anchor, most journalists must
first work several other (less glamorous) broadcast jobs.
The singular focus of some students can be upsetting to
veteran broadcast professionals. Each of the FBJs inter-
viewed expressed annoyance with students/recent graduates
who scoffed at entry-level work. R1 (N. T. Taylor, personal
communication, April 20, 2013) stated, "One thing that I've
seen is that a lot of students think they know everything
because they're going through a program. So they want to
tell a person with experience how to do things. And that's
wrong."
While internal motivation cannot be taught, expectations
can be managed. That is to say, JIs need to explain that entry-
level work, even with a college degree, is often the first step
to gaining employment in the broadcast industry. Instructors
must make it clear that positions such as master control oper-
ator or weekend studio camera operator are important first
steps to lifelong work as a broadcaster. Furthermore, JIs must
explain that tasks, such as rolling cables, are critical aspects
of the business. R2 (N. T. Taylor, personal communication,
April 20, 2013) may have put it best by commenting, "You
got to start somewhere, you have to build up a resume, make
your contacts."
Parting thoughts on student motivation.To say current
students are unmotivated is untrue. Rather, the students are
differently motivated. Instructors, who empower their stu-
dents, tend to have students more capable of moving into the
profession. JIs, however, must manage student expectations.
Never letting the students feel that they (the students) are too
good for entry-level broadcast work.
Chapter 5
Discussion
Bridging the gap: the development of an advisory board.Broad-
cast Journalism practitioners are at the center of the changes
discussed earlier. More important, though, it is the practitio-
ners who will be mentoring, training, and hiring the students
who graduate from the post-secondary broadcast journalism
departments. There is an unbreakable bond between broad-
cast as an industry and as an academic course of learning.
When one considers this close bond, the question must be
asked, why are these two groups not working together on a
regular basis? A method for building relationships, increas-
ing industry knowledge, and developing best instructional
practices is an advisory board consisting of practicing FBJs,
JIs, and MC students.
Advisory board. An advisory board is a group of knowledge-
able professionals who, through shared vision, work to
improve not only the state of their profession but also class-
room teaching techniques. Through an advisory board,
experts in the field have the opportunity to increase profes-
sional knowledge, improve current practices, and create
guidelines for educational standards. Benigni et al. (2011)
explain one reason an MC department should establish an
advisory board:
With declining budgets and shrinking job markets, academic
departments must become more proactive in engaging industry
leadership in order to meet departmental needs for support and
Taylor and Maxwell 9
to assist their students with the transition to paid work after
graduation. (p. 57)
The literature discusses the tendency of JIs to struggle in
isolation (Benigni et al., 2011; Du & Thornburg, 2011).
There are several reasons for this isolation. Much of the iso-
lation is due to the JIs' busy schedules. Often overwhelming
workloads force JIs to solve issues on their own rather than
consulting a board (Du & Thornburg, 2011). However, there
is also a tendency for educators to look inward rather than
out to the community for answers.
For whatever reason JIs' isolation occurs, it must stop.
The literature illustrates that MC students feel unprepared
once they enter the workforce (Du & Thornburg, 2011).
Clearly, it is time new tactics are put in place. One new tactic
to be considered is the advisory board.
An effective advisory board can help bridge the divide
between FBJs and JIs. The literature suggests the board
should consist of pro-active individuals who are interested in
improving the state of MC education (Benigni et al., 2011;
Du & Thornburg, 2011). Benigni et al. (2011) recommend a
group that includes FBJs, JIs, and students. In other words,
all stakeholders should have a role in the advisory board.
Limitations of paper. The purpose of this article is to begin the
conversation between broadcast journalism professionals
and university broadcast journalism departments. For that
reason, the sample size (n = 4) is small. The small sample
size makes generalizability and transferability difficult.
This limitation can be expected when conducting natural-
istic inquiry. Lincoln and Guba (1985) define this limitation
as Axiom 3, The Possibility of Generalization. Axiom 3,
according to Lincoln and Guba, states, "Only time-and-
context bound working hypotheses . . . are possible" (p. 38).
The author maintains that the limitation of Axiom 3 does not
diminish the importance of this article. The voices of all
stakeholders must be heard, acknowledged, and considered.
Topic for further study.Developing a conversation between
journalism professionals and instructors requires both groups
to take part in the discussion. Further study in this area would
necessitate interviewing both journalism professionals and
instructors. Focus groups, where both groups share percep-
tions and ideas, can be a method for facilitating these discus-
sions. Future studies must also include discussions of best
curricular practices. MC departments constantly update
assignments and curriculums. Future studies must highlight
the innovative work of the JI.
Tone of interviews. FBJs observe the end result of JIs' work.
That end result is the trained broadcast journalism student/
recent graduate. This fact places FBJs in a unique position to
evaluate and critique the work of JIs. For that reason, the
voice of the FBJ must be heard.
The FBJs' voices in this article may seem critical of
educators. Where in fact, the FBJs interviewed
had tremendous respect for JIs. R2 (N. T. Taylor, personal
communication, April 20, 2013) illustrated respect for edu-
cators by saying, "No doubt the professor plays an impor-
tant role." A critical tone may be due to the following: (a)
Each of the professionals explained that it was not uncom-
mon for post-secondary broadcast journalism departments
to disregard their (the FBJs) suggestions. So, when finally
given a chance to talk, years of built-up ideas and concerns
flooded out. (b) The lead researcher did not ask, "What are
universities doing right?" For these reasons, the FBJs were
not able to discuss areas in which the educators are
successful.
Final thoughts. Changes in the broadcast journalism profes-
sion need to be addressed at the post-secondary level.
Mensing (2010) argues that broadcast journalism is often
taught by out-of-touch instructors who utilize textbooks with
outdated information. This may be a valid argument. Jour-
nalism instructors will often claim the importance of teach-
ing only "the basics." The problem with instructing the
basics is that many of those basic rules have changed since
2010. To ensure that broadcast journalism students are com-
petitive in the market place, JIs need to consider updating the
curriculum. When updating the curriculum, instructors need
to consult industry professionals
The information for this report was derived from both the
academic literature and the recommendations of interviewed
broadcast professionals. After considering all the informa-
tion provided, this report suggests curricular updates in the
areas of technology, hands-on learning, and managing stu-
dent expectations. The overriding suggestion of this report,
however, is the importance of working in tandem with
broadcast industry professionals during the broadcast jour-
nalism departments' curricular update process.
