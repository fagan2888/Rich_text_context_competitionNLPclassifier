In 2010, a total of 11,818 women in the United States were
newly diagnosed with cervical cancer and 3,939 women died
from the disease (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC], 2012). This is particularly troubling because cervical
cancer is preventable with routine Pap tests (American
Cancer Society [ACS], 2013). In general, most women are
aware of the Pap test and of the benefits of routine cervical
cancer screening (CCS; Hawkins, Cooper, Saraiya, Gelb, &
Polonec, 2011). Yet, many women fail to obtain screening.
Among those with advanced stage cervical cancer, most had
either never been screened or failed to obtain routine screen-
ing (ACS, 2013). Understanding the barriers to routine
screening is essential to improved rates of adherence to CCS.
Frequently cited barriers associated with women not get-
ting routine screening are being uninsured, poor, and having
less education (Bazargan, Bazargan, Farooq, & Baker, 2004;
Behbakht, Lynch, Teal, Degeest, & Massad, 2004). To the
extent that these resource-related factors (e.g., income,
insurance coverage) predict avoidance or lack of CCS, it
becomes obvious we must increase access to services and
availability of screening to improve routine screening.
Furthermore, however, it is important that we gain a better
understanding of the factors that contribute to avoidance of
CCS in women who have access to health care but avoid
screening despite these resources. In previous qualitative
research on attitudes toward CCS (Ackerson, 2010;
Ackerson, Pohl, & Low, 2008), some participants chose not
to get a Pap test even though they had available resources
(i.e., access to care, insurance coverage). In these small
qualitative studies, personal barriers (including negative
emotions) emerged as the most powerful factor related to
avoidance of routine screening. We propose that these other
barriers, particularly those relating to personal history, will
predict avoidance behavior in this sample of women with
access to health care. A better understanding of these spe-
cific barriers contributing to avoidance in this population is

Modifying and Pilot Testing the Pap
Smear Belief Questionnaire

Abstract
This study is a report on modifications and pilot testing of a measurement tool to predict Pap testing based on the Interaction
Model of Client Health Behavior. Women have been found to avoid routine cervical cancer screening (CCS) due to personal
influencing factors. For this study, the Pap Smear Belief Questionnaire (PSBQ) was modified by adding items and evaluated
through content validity index (CVI = .89) and cognitive interviews (think-aloud protocol), resulting in a 31-item instrument
with four subscales (Benefits, Barriers, Vulnerability, Experiences). Pilot testing the modified PSBQ was conducted at a local
agency. Fifty-three women completed and returned the PSBQ, which had good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha
coefficient of .81 (Benefits  = .51; Barriers  = .85; Vulnerability  = .78; Experiences  = .87). Test­retest reliability of the
31-item PSBQ was also good (.878). Univariate logistic regression indicated that the only significant predictor of seeking/
avoiding routine screening by women's background characteristics was social influence (p = .04). Subscales found to be
significant predictors in Pap testing were Barriers (p = .003) and Gynecological Exam Experiences (p = .04). The refined 31-
item PSBQ has good psychometric data supporting its use in predicting CCS. However, this research should be replicated in
a larger sample enabling further validity and reliability testing of the PSBQ. Understanding women's attitudes toward CCS will
help health care providers, who deal with gynecological health, develop more effective screening programs and interventions
facilitating better experiences for women contributing to an increase in routine screening.

essential, so that relevant intervention models can be devel-
oped to address the core barriers, above and beyond the
obvious need to increase access to services for a broad range
of women. To this end, it is necessary to have a measure of
the social and emotional barriers to CCS that may be modi-
fiable in intervention approaches.
The Interaction Model of Client Health Behavior
(IMCHB; Cox, 1982) is a useful guiding framework to
explore the factors that influence women to obtain (or avoid)
CCS, particularly among those who otherwise have access
to health care in general (Ackerson, 2012; Ackerson et al.,
2008). The IMCHB assumes that each client is a unique and
active dynamic agent who has both the desire and the ability
to make informed decisions regarding their health care
(Cox, 1982). The model assumes that the decisional process
relative to health behavior for each individual is driven by
the interaction of the element of client singularity (unique
client characteristics) and client­provider interaction (inter-
vention) to produce the client health outcome or behavior
(seeking or avoiding routine CCS). This model is a flexible
model, where the researcher can select all or portions of the
model based on the purpose of the study.Abel and Chambers
(2004) used two elements of the IMCHB (client singularity
and health outcome) to guide their study, which addressed
sexual health among Hispanic women. Whereas Wagner,
Bear, and Davidson (2011) applied all three elements of the
model (client singularity, client­provider interaction, and
client health outcome) exploring postpartum women's satis-
faction with the educational intervention they received.
However, outside of the principal investigator's (PI's) stud-
ies, no other published studies have used the IMCHB to
address CCS.
Of interest for this study are the elements of client singu-
larity and health outcome. The first element includes back-
ground characteristics such as demographic variables (age,
race/ethnicity, history of last Pap test), social influences that
may promote or discourage health preventive behavior
(mother, family members, health care provider, media, oth-
ers), previous health care experiences (gynecological
exam--Pap test and pelvic), and environmental resources
(income, education, insurance availability). The client sin-
gularity element also includes a range of dynamic variables,
such as cognitive appraisal (beliefs about the benefits and
barriers to CCS, perceptions of vulnerability to cervical can-
cer), affective response (emotional reactions to an event
such as previous screening/health care interactions), and
motivation (a process that causes action and involves social,
emotional response and cognitive forces). In addition, we
included a history of interpersonal trauma (IPT; sexual and/
or physical abuse), which has emerged in our qualitative
research as a strong potential predictor of CCS behavior
(Ackerson, 2012; Ackerson et al., 2008). The variables
included in client singularity are believed to interact to pro-
duce a specific health behavior (i.e., seeking or avoiding
Pap tests).
Therefore, understanding how personal influencing fac-
tors contribute to screening behavior will help health care
providers develop more effective interventions. The aim of
this study was to modify and pilot test the Pap Smear Belief
Questionnaire (PSBQ), determine its psychometric proper-
ties and its predictive validity related to Pap test avoidance.
Method
Participants
Study participants were female employees of a not-for-profit
continuum of care facility located in Michigan, employed in
a wide range of positions (e.g., administrative, nursing, nurs-
ing assistants, housekeeping, clerical, kitchen services,
maintenance, environmental, and entry level). This facility
was selected because they employ a large number of people,
most of them are women, with diversity in education and
income.
Procedures
Prior to conducting this study (instrument modification and
pilot testing the PSBQ), approval was obtained from the PI's
university institutional review board. Women below age 21,
older than 70, and those who had a hysterectomy were ineli-
gible to participate because they fall outside of recommended
screening guidelines (American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists [ACOG], 2009).
Instrument
Data collected included a series of demographic questions
and background characteristic questionnaire and the PSBQ.
Background characteristics were addressed with 11 ques-
tions related to an individual's demographics, environmental
resources, social influences related to Pap testing, personal
history of CCS behavior, and history of IPT. Although CCS
guidelines have been modified in recent years, at the time the
current study was conducted (March 2011), recommended
guidelines for routine Pap testing were every 2 years for
women between ages 21 and 29, and every 3 years for women
between ages 30 and 65/70 for those with three previous nor-
mal tests (ACOG, 2009), and thus these criteria were used to
determine whether a woman was adherent to CCS.
Steps in Instrument Refinement
The PSBQ was developed and tested in a previous study
using nursing students and included 17 items with three
subscales--Benefits, Barriers, and Vulnerability
(Ackerson, Zielinski, & Patel, 2014). Internal consistency
reliability of the 17-item PSBQ was .60 (Benefits .58,
Barriers .86, and Vulnerability .81). In the present study,
based on the PI's previous qualitative research (Ackerson,
Ackerson et al. 3
2010, 2012; Ackerson et al., 2008), 14 additional items
were added to the PSBQ: 2 items addressing the benefits of
screening, 3 items addressing vulnerability, and a new sub-
scale addressing the gynecological exam experience
(Ackerson, 2012).
The newly developed experience subscale, which con-
sisted of six items, was distributed to five professional
experts in women's health and IPT. Only three of the five
responded, a sufficient number to conduct a content validity
index (CVI; Polit & Beck, 2010). The experts were instructed
to consider each of the experience subscale items and to
select only one of four different responses (1 = not relevant;
2 = somewhat relevant; 3 = quite relevant; and 4 = very rel-
evant), which, in their opinion, best represents their own
judgment regarding each of the respective items. In addition,
they were encouraged to respond to an open-ended question:
"Are there content areas relevant to women's experiences
with the Pap smear and pelvic exam that is missing?" Two of
the experts fully agreed on five of the items being very rele-
vant. One expert agreed that two items were very relevant,
three items were quite relevant, and one item was not rele-
vant. The one item deemed somewhat relevant by one expert
and not relevant by another was "I only want to see female
providers." A comment was made that there could be many
reasons beyond the pelvic exam as to why someone would
prefer a female provider. From the open-ended questions,
one expert recommended three additional questions. These
questions were as follows: (a) "I do not trust health care pro-
viders"; (b) I feel like I am being violated when the provider
does not explain to me what they are doing during the female
exam"; and (c) "When the provider rushes through the female
exam it makes me feel on edge." These questions were con-
sidered and believed to more accurately describe women's
concerns and were subsequently added to the subscale. The
item "I only want to see female providers" was not deleted
from the scale, since through prior qualitative research
(Ackerson, 2012), provider's gender was a very important
issue among participants and deemed important. The sub-
scale's CVI was calculated to be .89, which is considered
sufficient (Polit & Beck, 2010). Finally, a sample of women
between ages 21 and 70 who self-reported a history of IPT
was recruited from a local agency to participate in cognitive
interviews.
Cognitive interviews (think-aloud protocol; Pett, Lackey,
& Sullivan, 2003; Polit & Beck, 2010) are a qualitative
method used to collect data about cognitive processes, such
as thinking, problem-solving, and decision-making. For this
portion of the project, women who self-identified as having a
history of IPT were considered experts to evaluate the ques-
tionnaire and acceptability of the experience items.
Verbal and written instructions were provided to the
women by the PI on how to "think aloud." The think-aloud
protocol (Willis, 1999) was conducted through verbal report-
ing of the participant's thought processes during the task of
responding to the items on the questionnaire.
Ten individual interviews were completed. Among these 10
interviews, no refinements, modifications, or new questions
were suggested. Based on the cognitive interviews, no cogni-
tive problems were identified, indicating that the women
understood and accurately interpreted the experience questions
and the remainder of the questions in the instrument. Only one
change was made to an item on the Benefits scale after one
participant suggested that "People doing Pap smears are rude to
women" should be revised to simply read "People doing Pap
smears are rude," as men cannot receive a Pap test.
The final version of the PSBQ has 31 items in four sub-
scales that address the elements of client singularity (previous
healthcareexperience,cognitiveappraisal,affectiveresponse):
Benefits (7 items: early detection, treatment effectiveness,
peace of mind), Barriers (9 items: fear of finding something
wrong and being afraid of not understanding what will be
done, embarrassment, knowledge of where to access, time
constraints, remembering to schedule, more important life
issues, and too old to need a Pap), Vulnerability (2 items: risk
[personal and family], taking care of health by exercising and
eating right, and using protection with sex), and Experience (9
items: Pap and pelvic exam, provider approach and gender
preference, unwanted memories and feelings). Items are
answered on a Likert-type scale from 1 = strongly disagree to
5 = strongly agree, with potential scores for the entire scale
ranging from 31 to 155 (subscale ranges: Benefits, 7-35;
Barriers, 9-45; Vulnerability, 6-30; and Experiences, 9-45).
The scale has positively and negatively worded items.
Data Collection
To conduct an ethical, non-coercive sampling, all employees
(female and male) of the health care agency received the
PSBQ in their mailbox. Male employees were instructed to
either return the questionnaire indicating their gender, or dis-
card. The female employees who chose to participate were
asked to select a six-digit code to put on each questionnaire
to connect their responses from Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2).
The initial questionnaire (T1), including the PSBQ and
demographic and personal history questions, was accompa-
nied by a letter introducing the study letting them know their
employer had no affiliation with this study and would never
know who participated, requesting that they return the com-
pleted questionnaire within 1 week, and a stamped pre-
addressed return envelope. Reminder postcards were placed
in all of the employee mailboxes after the first week. At T2
(2 weeks post), participants completed only the PSBQ.
Informed consent was provided to potential participants and
was assumed with return of the completed questionnaire.
Participants received no compensation.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using R Statistical Package Version
2.15.1 (2012). To understand differences in attitudes and
4 SAGE Open
beliefs in women who seek or avoid routine Pap testing, par-
ticipants were placed in one of two groups (Routine/Non-
Routine) based on their response to the question regarding
when they had their last Pap test. Univariate logistic regres-
sions (Kutner, Neter, Nachtsheim, & Li, 2004) were con-
ducted to examine if any of the background characteristics
and PSBQ subscales were significant predictors of seeking
(Routine) or avoiding (Non-Routine) CCS. Temporal stabil-
ity was assessed through test­retest reliability with an intra-
class correlation and construct validity through known-group
technique with independent-sample t test. All negatively
worded items were reverse coded prior to analysis.
Significance was set at p = .05 across analyses.
After running the univariate statistics, we decided to
dichotomize variables associated with some of the back-
ground characteristics due to low cell sizes in certain catego-
ries. We reduced yearly income to US$30,000 or
>US$30,000; educational attainment to  high school (or
general education diploma [GED]) or >high school; insur-
ance availability to yes/no; and age at first intercourse to <18
years of age or 18 years of age.
Results
Sixty-five questionnaires were returned for T1 (16% response
rate), with 53 meeting eligibility for participation (6 were
eliminated due to male gender, 2 women were below 21 years
of age, and 4 reported having had a hysterectomy). Nineteen
questionnaires were returned for T2 (36% response rate). For
the current study, the PSBQ had good internal consistency,
with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .81. Subscale alphas
were generally good to acceptable with Barriers  = .85,
Vulnerability  = .78, and Experiences  = .87, with only the
Benefits subscale having a poor internal consistency ( =
.51). Reliability of the Benefit subscale decreased in this
study from the previous study (Ackerson et al., 2014). An
explanation for this may be that this sample was more homo-
geneous in their beliefs about the benefits of screening, or the
two items that were added affected reliability estimates.
These items may be addressing factors other than benefits of
screening. Test­retest reliability of the 31-item PSBQ was
conducted and found to be very good (.823). Range of scores
on the PSBQ in the current study was 93 to 138, with higher
scores representing more positive attitudes toward screening.
Construct Validity Through Known-Group
Technique
Placing the participants in one of two groups allowed the
opportunity to use a contrasting or known-group approach to
validity (Polit & Beck, 2010). If the PSBQ 31 is a valid mea-
sure, then the non-routine participants should exhibit signifi-
cantly lower scores reflecting more negative attitudes.
Independent t tests were conducted to compare the mean
PSBQ 31 between the non-routine and routine groups. The
non-routine group of women had significantly lower scores
(111.00, SD = 11.46) than the routine group of women
(120.93, SD = 10.12; Table 1). The magnitude of the differ-
ences in the between-groups total was moderate (2 = .13).
The guidelines (proposed by Cohen, 1988) for interpreting
the effect size value are as follows: .01 = small effect, .06 =
moderate effect, .14 = large effect (Pallant, 2005). This dem-
onstrates that the PSBQ had statistically significant moderate
effects using the known-groups technique; women who
avoid routine Pap testing would be predicted to have more
negative attitudes toward Pap testing and cervical cancer
than those women who obtain routine Pap tests.
The demographic profile of the 53 respondents is pre-
sented in Table 2. Eighty-one percent (n = 43) indicated hav-
ing a Pap test within the previous 3 years. Women ranged in
age from 21 to 66 (M = 43), and were predominately
Caucasian (79.2%) with yearly incomes of US$30,000 or
less (53%). Most were educated, with 91% of the sample
reporting having some college or a college degree. Most
women were covered by medical insurance (89%). Thirty-
one percent of the sample reported a history of sexual trauma
and 24% had experienced physical trauma.
Results of the univariate logistic regression indicated that
the only significant predictor of seeking/avoiding routine
screening by women's background characteristics was social
influence (p = .04; odds ratio [OR] = 5.83), although insur-
ance availability was marginally significant (p = .06; see
Table 2). A majority of the routine group were socially influ-
enced to value CCS by their mothers and health care provid-
ers, whereas a majority of the non-routine group reported
being influenced by no one. The subscales found to be sig-
nificant predictors in Pap testing were Barriers to Screening
(p = .003) and Gynecological Exam Experiences (p = .045;
see Table 1).

Discussion
The refined 31-item version of the PSBQ has good psycho-
metric data supporting its use in predicting CCS. In particu-
lar, two subscales from the measure were particularly strong
predictors of CCS attendance: Barriers and Previous Exam
Experiences. The results of this study provide further
understanding of women's personal characteristics, as well
as their attitudes and beliefs about CCS that relate to avoid-
ing routine CCS, even in the context of availability of health
care. It is relevant to note that a substantial portion of women
in this sample avoid CCS, despite having insurance cover-
age. Furthermore, women who seek CCS and women who
avoid CCS both recognized that there were benefits to

obtaining a Pap test. Thus, both basic knowledge of the ben-
efits of CCS and having insurance (thus access) seem to be
inadequate to promote screening behavior. Despite the fact
that this was a reasonably well-educated sample of women,
misinformation about cervical cancer and Pap tests was prev-
alent. Many women reported feeling that they were not vul-
nerable to cervical cancer and thus did not believe testing
was necessary (in both the routine and non-routine CCS
groups). However, the source of this perceived invulnerabil-
ity may be different for the two groups: The routine group
may feel that they are not vulnerable to cervical cancer
because they obtain routine screenings. However, women
who avoid routine screening may lack knowledge about
screening, or be misinformed regarding cervical cancer risks.
This may, in turn, perpetuate a belief of invulnerability,
thereby contributing to avoidance behavior. This information
is important, particularly in the context of our finding that the
women who do not seek routine screening generally report
no other support or encouragement from their social resources
to influence screening behavior. Not only can social supports
be utilized to encourage screening behavior, but perhaps
these same social influences could also be used to share cor-
rective health information that might influence women to
seek routine CCS.
Indeed, women who were socially influenced to value and
receive a Pap test were more than 5 times more likely to
receive routine screening, compared with women who had no
social influences. Specifically, women in this study were
encouraged to obtain screening primarily by their mothers and
health care providers, which helps illuminate the importance
of highly influential others in contributing to screening behav-
ior. Interventions to boost seeking and adherence to CCS
guidelines, then, may be made more effective by incorporating
the support of these others to encourage women's screening.
This is particularly salient, given the finding that women who
avoid screening had no major social influences that encour-
aged CCS. Approximately 58% of the routine group indicated
that they were socially influenced to value routine CCS either
by their mother (37.2%) or by health care provider (34.9%),
whereas 50% of the non-routine group reported that no one
influenced them. These findings are similar to previous
research, which found that women who avoid routine screen-
ing were not socially influenced by any important individual
in their life and did not receive adequate information to make
a well-informed decision regarding CCS (Ackerson, 2010,
2012; Ackerson & Gretebeck, 2007). Although previous
research has found some mixed results as to the power of
health care provider influence at promoting Pap testing (Fatone
& Jandorf, 2009; Ogedegbe et al., 2005), the current results
suggest that providers play an important role. The influence of
health care providers may interact with the quality of a wom-
an's relationship with her provider, relationship stability, and
factors such as rapport and trust. It is also possible that even
when women who avoid CCS recognize the value of such pre-
ventive health care, other factors including negative previous
exam experiences are more salient and may have a greater
impact on their screening behavior.
Women's perceptions of barriers to routine screening and
a negative history of gynecological exam experiences may
directly contribute to avoidance. In this study, the non-rou-
tine group perceived more personal barriers. Perceived bar-
riers to obtaining routine Pap tests are both system barriers
and individual barriers. System barriers such as time, access,
and how women are treated at the time of the exam are
important to address and can be modified in the health care
setting or through social endeavors, such as the Affordable
Care Act. Insurance availability was marginally significant
among this group of women (most of them were insured).
Having insurance is a well-known predictor of CCS, and
women without health insurance are less likely to receive
routine screening (Fedewa et al., 2012). However, even
insured women are vulnerable to screening avoidance, par-
ticularly when they have low income and higher copays.
Making gynecological visits more accessible and conve-
nient for women (evening visits and weekends, especially
for women who may not be able to take time off from work)
is one way to reduce this perceived barrier. In addition,
changing how Pap tests are delivered by making sure pro-
viders are trained to deliver the exam in a sensitive manner
is one way to address a system-level barrier that will, of
course, help put women at ease. This modification also has
the potential to influence individual-level barriers that pre-
vent women from seeking screening, as it is likely to make
women feel more knowledgeable, less embarrassed, and
build trust with their provider.
Indeed, individual barriers, such as fear and embarrass-
ment, are not uncommon in the research literature associ-
ated with avoidance behavior (Guilfoyle, Franco, & Gorin,
2007; Guvenc, Akyuz, & Açikel, 2011). These internal bar-
riers are difficult to overcome and, just as they are likely to
be related to a complex range of factors including previous
personal and health care experiences, interventions address-
ing these internal barriers will require a multifaceted
approach. A positive interaction between the woman and her
provider is necessary. A provider who explains what will be
done at the time of the gynecological exam may promote
increase in knowledge, reduce fear and anxiety of the
unknown, and help promote feelings that the screening test
is important, thus increasing the likelihood of routine
screening.
Some research indicates that women avoid CCS because
they are afraid something abnormal will be found, and they
would prefer ignorance rather than the negative screening
result (Ackerson & Preston, 2009). This avoidance too is
likely an emotional response to the anxiety associated with the
uncertainty or threat (abnormal cervical cells vs. normal cells).
As women in the current study in large part believed that they
were not vulnerable to cervical cancer, screening avoidance
may have been related to fear of this threat. This anxiety-
related barrier to screening may also relate to previous
Ackerson et al. 7
negative exam experiences (e.g., excessive worry over an
abnormal test result) and/or may contribute to their lack of
trust in providers (e.g., "Doctors only give bad news").
Many women perceive the gynecological exam to be an
uncomfortable procedure that has the potential to make an
individual feel vulnerable and embarrassed. Factors that may
contribute to negative perceptions of or experiences with Pap
testing include providers who are not sensitive to a woman's
individual needs, who are not "present" at that visit, or who
do not treat the woman with respect. Providers who fail to
provide clear verbal communication about the Pap procedure
or who approached the exam in a hurried manner may exac-
erbate these negative feelings (Ackerson, 2012). These nega-
tive emotions related to the screening may be even more
substantial for women with a history of sexual or physical
abuse or assault. Women with these histories may avoid
screening due to the physical nature of the exam, which may
serve as a reminder of the traumatic event for some women.
Although the difference was not statistically significant in
our sample, it is important to note that 50% of the non-rou-
tine group reported having a history of interpersonal violence
(compared with only 32% of routine group), thus it is possi-
ble that the study may have been underpowered to find this
effect due to the small sample size.
Strengths and Limitations
The current study has important strengths and some limita-
tions. This study is among the first of which we are aware to
utilize a multidimensional theoretical model to explore a
range of factors contributing to seeking/avoiding routine
screening behavior. The sample, which represented a wide
range of working women, adds a valuable contribution to this
literature, which has often examined CCS behavior in more
discrete samples (e.g., low-income, uninsured women).
Because participants were selected from one large workplace,
however, it is possible that the findings might not be represen-
tative of working women or women with access to health care
in general. The low response rate may reflect a response bias,
thus results should be interpreted with some caution, although
other factors may have also played a role, for example, some
employees may work outside of the office, thus not have had
access to the survey in their mailbox during the open time
period for response submission. Because of the small sample
size, factor analysis could not be conducted, which is another
procedure to help validate measurement tools. To conduct a
factor analysis with a 31-item scale, it is recommended that
there be at least 10 to 15 participants for each item (Pett et al.,
2003). Therefore, we would have needed anywhere from 310
to 480 participants. In addition, as this was a pilot study, we
should have included some open-ended questions at the end
of the instrument asking for any comments they wish to make
about the instrument. Overall, however, the current study
offers important insights into factors contributing to screen-
ing/avoidance, which may help future efforts develop
in-clinic or community-based interventions to promote
screening behavior.
Implications for Practice
Despite the ample scientific evidence that routine Pap tests
decrease cervical cancer, some women still avoid routine
screening. This research should be replicated in a larger,
more socioeconomically and educationally diverse sample
to better understand background characteristics and experi-
ences that influence routine screening behavior in a wider
range of women. In addition, a larger sample will enable
further validity and reliability testing of the PSBQ, that is,
factor analysis. Further research should be conducted evalu-
ating how providers describe the interaction between them-
selves and their client. It is important to obtain not only the
client's perspective, but the provider's as well at the time or
soon after the interaction occurs. Understanding any differ-
ences in perceptions (client's and provider's) associated
with the interaction (Pap test and pelvic exam) may lend to
improved communication techniques, exam approach,
affective support, which has the potential to contribute to
better care and client satisfaction. Understanding women's
attitudes toward CCS will help health care providers, who
deal with gynecological health, develop more effective
screening programs and interventions, thus facilitating a
better experience for women and contributing to an increase
in routine screening.
Conclusion
Improving rates of adherence to routine Pap testing is a mul-
tifaceted and complicated public health problem. Personal
barriers contributing to avoidance behavior may need to be
addressed individually and through community- or family-
based interventions directed at women who avoid or are at
risk of avoiding routine screening. We also need to address
the ways in which health care providers educate and interact
with women, and ensure that Pap testing is both encouraged
and approached in a careful and sensitive way. Future out-
reach efforts must include components designed to address
women's emotional experiences and the emotional factors
that related to screening avoidance. If we can predict the
negative emotions elicited by the exam in some women, we
can develop public health interventions that will be sensitive
and responsive to women at greatest risk for avoiding future
screenings.
