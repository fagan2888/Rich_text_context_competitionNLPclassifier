Background: A study was undertaken to define the risk of death among a national cohort of US adults
both with and without lung disease.
Methods: Participants in the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) fol-
lowed for up to 22 years were studied. Subjects were classified using a modification of the Global Ini-
tiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease criteria for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
into the following mutually exclusive categories using the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
1
),
forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV
1
/FVC ratio, and the presence of respiratory symptoms: severe COPD,
moderate COPD, mild COPD, respiratory symptoms only, restrictive lung disease, and no lung disease.
Proportional hazard models were developed that controlled for age, race, sex, education, smoking sta-
tus, pack years of smoking, years since quitting smoking, and body mass index.
Results: A total of 1301 deaths occurred in the 5542 adults in the cohort. In the adjusted proportional
hazards model the presence of severe or moderate COPD was associated with a higher risk of death
(hazard ratios (HR) 2.7 and 1.6, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 2.1 to 3.5 and 1.4 to 2.0), as was
restrictive lung disease (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.0).
Conclusions: The presence of both obstructive and restrictive lung disease is a significant predictor of
earlier death in long term follow up.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an
important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States.1 The diagnosis of obstructive lung disease
has traditionally depended on the presence of symptoms such
as chronic cough or chronic sputum production.2 New
international guidelines for the diagnosis of obstructive lung
disease depend almost exclusively on measured lung function
to diagnose and classify disease.3 Lung function is not
routinely measured in most patients, and a significant
proportion of the population with abnormal lung function has
no diagnosed lung disease.4
Impaired lung function has previously been shown to
predict mortality, although most previous studies have not
used clinical criteria to classify COPD, and none to our knowl-
edge have looked at the effect of restrictive lung disease on
mortality.5­11
We applied spirometric criteria for the diagnosis of obstruc-
tive and restrictive lung disease to a cohort of 5542 subjects in
whom pulmonary function measurements had been per-
formed as part of the First National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES I). We searched the NHANES
I follow up database for death in the follow up period of up to
22 years and determined the significant predictors of death in
this cohort.
METHODS
The National Center for Health Statistics conducted NHANES
I from 1971 to 1975. This was a survey of a probability sample
of the civilian non-institutionalised population of the United
States.12 13 Follow up surveys of the adult participants (aged
25­74 years) in NHANES I were undertaken in 1982­4, 1986,
1987, and 1992.14­17 Data collected on participants included
hospitalisation records, vital status, and death certificates (for
those who had died). Up to 1992, 96% of the original cohort
had been successfully traced and death certificates were avail-
able for 98% of the 4604 documented deaths.15
Questionnaire data
Participants in NHANES I completed an extensive question-
naire that included age, race, sex, and education level. Partici-
pants were classified as having <12 years or >13 years of
education. A nationally representative subset of participants
completed a cardiorespiratory module that included a series of
questions about the presence of respiratory symptoms and the
diagnosis of respiratory disease. Pulmonary symptoms in-
cluded in the analysis (used to define an asymptomatic subset
of the population to calculate equations for lung function and
define a subset of the cohort with only respiratory symptoms)
were cough (defined as a positive response to "Have you ever
had a cough first thing in the morning in the winter?" or
"Have you ever had a cough first thing in the morning in the
summer?"), sputum, (defined as a positive response to "Have
you ever had any phlegm from your chest first thing in the
morning in the winter?" or "Have you ever had any phlegm
from your chest first thing in the morning in the summer?"),
and wheeze (defined as a positive response to "Have you ever
had wheezy or whistling sounds in your chest?"). Participants
were also asked whether they had physician diagnosed
chronic bronchitis (non-allergic), emphysema, or asthma.
Complete smoking histories were obtained for all partici-
pants. Current smokers were defined as those who reported
the use of cigarettes, cigars, or pipes at the time of the survey,
and former smokers were those who reported any prior use of
cigarettes (at least 100 cigarettes), cigars (at least 50), or pipes
(at least three packages of tobacco), but no current use. Long
term "intensity of use" data were available only for cigarettes.
Pack-years of cigarette use were calculated by multiplying the
average number of cigarettes smoked daily by the number of
years smoked and dividing the product by 20. Former cigarette

Pulmonary function data
Spirometric data were obtained from participants in the
cardiorespiratory module using an Ohio Medical Instruments
800 spirometer. The procedures used have been described
previously.13 Subjects were excluded from the analysis if they
either did not perform spirometric tests or had results that
were not reliable. Data were included from subjects who did
not have "reproducible" measures (to be reproducible the FEV
1
and FVC from two reliable measurements had to be within 5%
for most subjects).18 Values used in the analysis included FVC,
FEV
1
, and the FEV
1
/FVC ratio. Predicted values of FEV
1
and
FVC were determined by performing linear regression (strati-
fied by sex and by using age and height as predictors) on a
subgroup of participants who were white never smokers who
did not report respiratory symptoms or physician diagnosed
lung disease. The results from these regression models (men:

FVC = ­7.49837 ­ age*0.03071 + height*0.19794, r2 = 0.589;

0.451) were applied to the data from all participants to obtain
predicted values of FEV
1
and FVC. An adjustment factor of
0.88 was used to estimate predicted values for black
participants.19 Using a modification of the Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria for COPD,
participants were classified into the following mutually exclu-
sive categories using FEV
1
, FVC, the FEV
1
/FVC ratio, and the
presence of respiratory symptoms: severe COPD (FEV

/FVC
<0.70 and FEV

/FVC
<0.70 and FEV

(FEV

>80%), symptoms only (presence
of respiratory symptoms in the absence of any lung function
abnormality), restrictive lung disease (FEV
1
>0.70 and FVC
<80% predicted), and no lung disease.
Death
Death certificate data were collected on NHANES I partici-
pants who died during the follow up period up to 1992 and
were included in the NHANES I follow up database. We
searched this database for all deaths and for deaths where
COPD or related conditions (asthma, bronchiectasis; ICD-9
codes 490­496) were listed as either the underlying cause of
death or as any cause of death.
Body mass index
Weight and height were measured at the examination. Body
mass index was calculated by dividing each participant's

following standard classifications were used: <18.5 kg/m2
(underweight), >18.5­24 kg/m2 (normal), 25­29 kg/m2 (over-
weight), >30 kg/m2 (obese).20
Analysis
Our primary outcome of interest was death, and the main
predictor of interest in our analysis was baseline lung
function. Analyses were performed using the statistical pack-
ages SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), SUDAAN (RTI,
Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) and SPSS (SPSS Inc,
Chicago, IL, USA). The results were similar in analyses
performed both with and without the NHANES I sampling
weights and complex design incorporated. Only the un-
weighted data are presented.
Cox proportional hazard regression models were developed
using the SUDAAN procedure SURVIVAL to account for differ-
ential follow up in NHANES I participants. Time of follow up
was used as the underlying time metric.For deaths,the exit date
was the date of death reported on the death certificate and, for
survivors, the exit date was the date the participant was last
known to be alive. Plots of the log-log survival curves for each
covariate were used to show that the proportional hazards
assumptions were met. Lung function category, age, sex, race,
smoking status, education level, body mass index, pulmonary
function level, pack-years of cigarette smoking, and years since
last smoked were included in the regression models and the
models were evaluated for interactions.
RESULTS
A total of 14 407 adults aged 25­74 years participated in the
nationally representative NHANES I survey. From this sample,
6913 (also nationally representative) participated in the cardio-
respiratory survey and examination. We excluded 1371
subjects who either did not have pulmonary function testing
done or had results which were not reliable, leaving 5542 in
the final cohort for analysis. Subjects excluded because of
missing or unreliable pulmonary function data were more
likely to be older than 60 years (37.8% v 22.8%, p<0.05) and to
be of non-white race (21.8% v 11.8%, p<0.05) than those
included in the final cohort. During the follow up period,
44.7% of excluded subjects died compared with 23.5% of the
cohort analysed.
The demographic characteristics of the cohort at baseline
are shown in table 1. Overall, 1.7% of participants had
evidence of severe COPD, 7.1% had evidence of moderate
COPD, and 9.2% had evidence of restrictive lung disease at
baseline. 860 of the 5542 subjects (15.5%) in the cohort ana-
lysed had non-reproducible spirometric measurements: 57.6%
of those with severe COPD, 38.8% of those with restrictive
lung disease, 30.6% of those with moderate COPD, 22.8% of
those with mild COPD, 9.5% of those with no lung disease, and

of all classes of COPD and restrictive lung disease increased
with increasing age (table 1).
The median duration of follow up of the cohort was 17.9
years (interquartile range (IQR) 15.4­19.0). During the follow
up period 1301 participants died. Subjects with severe COPD
had the highest death rate (70.7%) during the follow up
period, although this proportion varied with smoking status
(table 2). Of those with severe COPD at baseline who died
during follow up, 23.1% had COPD listed as the underlying
cause of death and an additional 24.6% had COPD listed as a
contributing cause of death (table 2, all subjects).
In the univariate proportional hazards model, all lung func-
tion impairment classifications--together with age, race, sex,
education level, and smoking--were associated with an
increased risk of death (table 3, fig 1). The number available
for follow up at each time interval is shown in table 4. In the
multivariate model severe COPD, moderate COPD, mild COPD,
and restrictive lung disease were all associated with an
increased risk of death (table 3). Adjustment for covariates
diminished the effect of lung function impairment on
mortality--for example, the hazards ratio for severe COPD

decreased from 6.6 (95% CI 5.1 to 8.6) in the univariate model
to 2.7 (95% CI 2.1 to 3.5) in the multivariate model.
Although we did not detect a significant interaction
between lung function category and smoking status (p=0.56),
we stratified the cohort by smoking status because of the bio-
logical plausibility that the development, progression, and
outcomes of lung disease differ between smokers and never
smokers.21 In the multivariate proportional hazard models
stratified by smoking status, moderate and severe COPD were
associated with an increased mortality risk in current and
former smokers, but not in never smokers (table 5).
Conversely, restrictive lung disease was associated with an
increased risk of mortality to a similar extent in all three
smoking categories (table 5).
DISCUSSION
In this analysis of a nationally representative cohort of the US
population followed for up to 22 years, the presence of moder-
ate or severe COPD or restrictive lung disease at baseline was
associated with an increased risk of death. Fewer than half of
those who had moderate or severe COPD at baseline and died
had a diagnosis of COPD listed anywhere on their death
certificate.
One difference between this and previous studies of the
relation between lung function and mortality is the use of
GOLD criteria to define baseline lung function. Previous stud-
ies have used quintiles or tertiles of FEV
1
in the analysis,11 22
continuous FEV
1
6 9 or an FEV
1
of >50% as the referent group.7
Most other studies which used only FEV
1
to categorise
subjects may include both subjects with restrictive disease and
those with obstructive disease.11 23 Prior analyses of the
NHANES I data, which included deaths up to 1987, only used
FEV
1
to classify lung disease,6 24 although one did incorporate
transfer factor (which was available on a subset of the
database) into the analysis.6
An interesting finding in our analysis was that, in never
smokers, moderate or severe COPD did not have a significantly
increased mortality risk. This is consistent with previous find-
ings that obstructive lung function impairment related
primarily to asthma is less lethal than that related to emphy-
sema or chronic bronchitis.21 Conversely, never smokers with
restrictive lung disease had an increased mortality hazard
similar to that seen in current and former smokers. Former
smokers with either severe or moderate COPD had a mortality
risk similar to that seen in current smokers. This could be
related to the observation that some former smokers may
continue to lose lung function at an accelerated rate.25

The precise mechanisms by which lung disease causes early
non-respiratory mortality are unknown, but may be related to
chronic muscle wasting, autonomic dysfunction, systemic
inflammation, oxidative stress, or other factors.26­31 Another
possibility is that mechanisms leading to reduced pulmonary
function may cause death from other causes, but there may be
no causal relationship.9­11
As was shown in a smaller study in Tucson, Arizona,32 our
analyses suggest that COPD is under-reported on death
certificates. This could be due to one of several factors: (1) the
deceased may never have been diagnosed with COPD, (2) the
deceased may have been diagnosed with COPD but the person
certifying the death did not feel this was a factor in the death,
or (3) the death certificate may have been completed by a per-
son unfamiliar with the medical history of the deceased
person.4 33
This analysis has certain limitations. Lung function was
only obtained at the baseline examination so we could not
determine the effect of lung function decline on mortality.22 23
Smoking status, which is an important predictor of mortality,
was not independently validated with biomarkers. Diagnosed
lung disease and respiratory symptoms were all self-reported
and not independently validated. Data on total lung capacity,
which are needed for the strict definition of restrictive lung
disease,34 were not available so it is possible that some subjects
classified as restrictive had other pathology or normal lung
volumes.35 Finally, 15.5% of subjects had non-reproducible
spirometric parameters, with this proportion being much
higher among subjects with lung disease. The net effect of
these final two biases would classify people with normal lung
function as having restrictive or obstructive lung disease and
would probably underestimate the effect of restrictive or
obstructive lung disease on mortality.
In conclusion, both obstructive and restrictive pulmonary
impairment are associated with an increased risk of mortality
during follow up. This finding may be clinically important,
particularly with regard to restrictive lung disease which can
have several different aetiologies and requires clinical evalua-
tion. Increased use of spirometric testing in the periodic adult
health screen, which is being promoted by the National Lung
Health Education Program,36 would probably increase the
early detection of both restrictive and obstructive lung
diseases.
