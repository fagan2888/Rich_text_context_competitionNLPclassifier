Introduction
Essential hypertension (EH) is the most common cardio-
vascular disease, affecting about one billion individuals
worldwide. It is evident that EH is a very important public
health challenge because its complications, including car-
diovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal diseases, are major
causes of morbidity and mortality.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a recently
described renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)
component that shares 42% identity with the catalytic
domain of somatic ACE, has been found to play a protec-
tive role in regulation of blood pressure homeostasis and
cardiac function.1 ACE2 has one active enzymatic site and
is responsible for degrading Ang II to the vasodilator Ang
1­7.2 ACE2 is a type 1 integral membrane glycoprotein
that is found in most tissues, with its highest expression
observed in the endothelium and heart.3 Yagil and Yagil
showed that ACE2-knockout mice had 10 mmHg higher
blood pressure and an enhanced response to angiotensin-II
infusion compared with normal mice.4 Thus, it was reason-
able to hypothesize that ACE2 might potentially be a can-
didate gene of EH.
So far, a lot of studies have investigated the association
between ACE2 polymorphisms and susceptibility of EH.5­19
However, the results from these studies were inconsistent.

converting enzyme 2 polymorphisms

Abstract
Background: Some studies have evaluated the associations between the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene
polymorphisms and essential hypertension (EH) risk. However, the results remain uncertain. We carried out a meta-
analysis to derive a more comprehensive estimation of these associations.
Methods: Case-control studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Chinese National Knowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wangfang databases. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to
assess the strength of the associations.
Results: Significant associations were found between the ACE2 G8790A polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.27;
95% CI, 1.11­1.44; p = 0.0004; I2 = 34%) and females (OR = 1.21; 95% CI, 1.09­1.34; p = 0.0003; I2 = 31%), respectively.
Significant associations were also observed between the ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.24;
95% CI, 1.10­1.39; p = 0.0004; I2 = 18%) and females (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27­1.51; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%), respectively.
However, there was no significant association between the ACE2 A1075G polymorphism and EH risk in males (OR =
1.27; 95% CI, 0.77­2.10; p = 0.35; I2 = 69%) and females (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83­1.26; p = 0.84; I2 = 33%), respectively.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the ACE2 G8790A and rs2106809 polymorphisms may be associated with EH risk.

Although three meta-analyses on this topic have be pub-
lished, some inconsistent results still exist.20­22 For example,
Lu et al. reported that the ACE2 gene polymorphism
G8790A was probably a genetic risk factor for essential
hypertension.20 However, Zhou et al. and Li found that the
ACE2 G8790A polymorphism might not be related to
increased EH risk.21,22 In addition, all these meta-analyses
focused on one polymorphism: G8790A polymorphism.
They did not evaluate the associations between other poly-
morphisms and EH risk. Hence, we performed a meta-
analysis of all eligible studies to derive a more precise esti-
mation of the associations of ACE2 polymorphisms with
EH risks. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehen-
sive meta-analysis of the association between ACE2 poly-
morphisms and EH susceptibility.
Methods
Publication search
Published studies were identified through a computerized
searchofPubMed,EMBASE,ChineseNationalKnowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wangfang databases (last search
was updated on May, 2014). The search terms were used as
follows: (essential hypertension or hypertension) and
(angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2) and (polymor-
phism or mutation or variant). We also perused the refer-
ence lists of all retrieved articles and relevant reviews.
There was no language restriction.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Eligible studies had to meet the following criteria: (a) only
case-control studies were considered, (b) the study
explored the correlation between ACE2 polymorphisms
with EH risk. Major exclusion criteria were: (a) no control
population, (b) no available genotype frequency, (c) when
duplication of the previous publications existed, the largest
or most recent publication was selected.
Data extraction
Information was extracted from all eligible publications
independently by two authors according to the inclusion
criteria listed above. The following information was
extracted from each study: first author, publication year,
racial background, age of patients, gender, number of
cases and controls, polymorphisms, and odds ratios (ORs)
and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of
EH risk.
Statistical analysis
OR and 95% CI were applied to assess the strength of the
association of ACE2 polymorphisms and EH risk. An
allele model was used in this meta-analysis, because most
of the studies reported the results in this model. Because
the ACE2 gene is located on the X chromosome, all of the
data for each sex were analyzed separately. Heterogeneity
among studies was calculated using the 2-based Cochran's
Q-statistic test (p < 0.10 was considered statistically sig-
nificant heterogeneity); the inconsistency index I2 statistic
was also calculated to observe between-study variability
that was due to heterogeneity rather than chance. This sta-
tistic, which was documented by percentage, yields result
ranging from 0 to 100% (I2 = 0­25%, no heterogeneity; I2
= 25­50%, moderate heterogeneity; I2 = 50­75%, large
heterogeneity; I2 = 75­100%, extreme heterogeneity). A
random effects model using the method of DerSimonian
and Laird was used in this meta-analysis. Sensitivity anal-
yses were conducted by deleting a single study each time
involved in the meta-analysis to identify the potential
influence of the individual data set on the pooled ORs.
Potential publication bias was assessed by Egger's
weighted regression method.23 All statistical analyses were
conducted using Stata software version 11.0. All p values
were two sided.
Results
Study characteristics
After a comprehensive literature search applying our
inclusion criteria, 15 relevant studies comprising 8966
patients and 5156 controls were identified in the final anal-
ysis. Two studies reported two case-control studies.
Therefore, a total of 17 studies were included in this meta-
analysis. There was only one study with Caucasians, while
the rest of the studies used Asians. There were three stud-
ies on A1075G polymorphism, 15 studies on G8790A
polymorphism, and four studies on rs2106809 polymor-
phism. The main study characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.
Quantitative data synthesis
The ACE2 A1075G polymorphism. Three studies determined
the association between A1075G polymorphism and EH
risk. The sample sizes for case and control groups were
1454 and 1363, respectively. There was no significant asso-
ciation between ACE2 A1075G polymorphism and EH risk
in males (OR = 1.27; 95% CI, 0.77­2.10; p = 0.35;
I2 = 69%) and females (OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 0.83­1.26; p =
0.84; I2 = 33%), respectively. Results of this meta-analysis
are shown in Table 2. We conducted one-way sensitivity
analysis to evaluate the stability of the meta-analysis. The
statistical significance of the results was not altered when
any single study was omitted (data not shown). Egger's test
did not indicate significant publication bias (p = 0.13 and
0.64, respectively).

The ACE2 G8790A polymorphism.Fifteen studies deter-
mined the association between G8790A polymorphism
and EH risk. The sample sizes for case and control
groups were 8437 and 4578, respectively. Significant
associations were found between ACE2 G8790A poly-
morphism and EH risk in males (OR = 1.27; 95% CI,
1.11­1.44; p = 0.0004; I2 = 34%) and females (OR =
1.21; 95% CI, 1.09­1.34; p = 0.0003; I2 = 31%), respec-
tively. Results of this meta-analysis are shown in Table
2. We conducted one-way sensitivity analysis to evaluate
the stability of the meta-analysis. The statistical signifi-
cance of the results was not altered when any single
study was omitted (data not shown). Egger's test did not
indicate significant publication bias (p = 0.47 and 0.21,
respectively).
The ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphism.Four studies deter-
mined the association between rs2106809 polymorphism
and EH risk. The sample sizes for case and control groups
were 5132 and 2373, respectively. Significant associations
were observed between ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphism
and EH risk in males (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10­1.39; p =
0.0004; I2 = 18%) and females (OR = 1.39; 95% CI, 1.27­
1.51; p < 0.00001; I2 = 0%), respectively. Results of this
meta-analysis are shown in Table 2. We conducted one-

Discussion
To evaluate the role of ACE2 in hypertension, various
genetically manipulated animal models were developed
for ACE2 deletion or overexpression. In the C57BL/6
mouse, ACE2 deficiency was associated with a modest
increase in blood pressure.24 ACE2 knockout mice have
highlighted hypertensive responses to Ang II infusion
associated with exaggerated accumulation of Ang II in the
kidney. The transgenic ACE2 overexpression in spontane-
ous hypertensive rat (SHR) showed a reduction of mean
arterial pressure irrespective of heart rate. This ACE2
overexpression model showed an increase of Ang-(1­7) in
plasma and kidney, and attenuated blood pressure eleva-
tion response to Ang II infusion.25 Taken together, these
results suggested that ACE2 was critical in the develop-
ment of EH. ACE2 was one of the most studied of the can-
didate genes for EH. The G8790A polymorphism was
situated in the intron adjoined to the extron, suggesting
that this locus could alter messenger RNA (mRNA) alter-
nate splicing and affect ACE2 gene expression. The latter
led to changes in the serum content of Ang1­7 that inhib-
ited vasoconstriction and cell proliferation.25 The func-
tional impact of rs2106809 remained unclear, but it has
been reported that some regulatory elements within
intronic sequences or residing up to 85 kb upstream of the
gene's promoter were still able to communicate with the
promoter and regulate gene expression.26 Thus, one can
reasonably speculate that the ACE2 rs2106809 T allele
may be functional and could downregulate the expression
of ACE2 and contribute to the increase in the susceptibility
to hypertension. Thus, it was plausible that these two poly-
morphisms could influence the susceptibility to EH.
In the present meta-analysis, we explored the associa-
tions between the ACE2 A1075G, G8790A and rs2106809
polymorphisms and EH risk, including 17 eligible case-
control studies. For the ACE2 A1075G polymorphism, no
significant result was detected. However, only three stud-
ies were included. Thus, the positive association between
ACE2 A1075G polymorphism and EH could not be ruled
out because studies with small sample size may have insuf-
ficient statistical power to detect a slight effect. For the
ACE2 G8790A polymorphism, 8437 cases and 4578 con-
trols were included. We found that individuals with the
8790A allele showed an increased risk of EH in males and
females, respectively. Actually, there was only one study
with Caucasians. Thus, we can conclude only that Asians
with ACE2 A1075G polymorphism might have increased
EH risk. This result was consistent with the previous meta-
analysis.20 For the ACE2 rs2106809 polymorphism, 5132
cases and 2373 controls were included. There was a sig-
nificant association between this polymorphism and EH
risk. Taken together, these results suggested that ACE2
G8790A and rs2106809 polymorphisms may play impor-
tant roles in the etiology of EH.
The present meta-analysis should be interpreted with
caution; several limitations merit consideration. First,
because of a lack of original data from the eligible stud-
ies, we could not perform other subgroup analyses based
on age, smoking, and so on. Second, the numbers of
published studies were not sufficient for a comprehen-
sive analysis, particularly for Caucasians and Africans.
However, our meta-analysis also had some merits. First,
we investigated the association between three polymor-
phisms and EH risk. Second, there was low heterogene-
ity in this meta-analysis.
This meta-analysis suggested that the ACE2 G8790A
and rs2106809 polymorphisms may be associated with EH
development. Further studies with a larger sample size are
needed to further assess the presence of an association.
