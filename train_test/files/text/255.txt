Objective: To describe the epidemiology of non-fatal recreational injuries among older adults treated in
United States emergency departments including national estimates of the number of injuries, types of
recreational activities, and diagnoses.
Methods: Injury data were provided by the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury
Program (NEISS-AIP), a nationally representative subsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS hospitals. Potential
cases were identified using the NEISS-AIP definition of a sport and recreation injury. The authors then
reviewed the two line narrative to identify injuries related to participation in a sport or recreational activity
among men and women more than 64 years old.
Results: In 2001, an estimated 62 164 (95% confidence interval 35 570 to 88 758) persons >65 years
old were treated in emergency departments for injuries sustained while participating in sport or
recreational activities. The overall injury rate was 177.3/100 000 population with higher rates for men
(242.5/100 000) than for women (151.3/100 000). Exercising caused 30% of injuries among women
and bicycling caused 17% of injuries among men. Twenty seven percent of all treated injuries were
fractures and women (34%) were more likely than men (21%) to suffer fractures.
Conclusions: Recreational activities were a frequent cause of injuries among older adults. Fractures were
common. Many of these injuries are potentially preventable. As more persons engage in recreational
activities, applying known injury prevention strategies will help to reduce the incidence of these injuries.
It is well known that the demographics of the United States
population are changing due to the growing proportion of
older Americans.1 It is also well known that regular
physical activity throughout life is important for maintaining
a healthy body, enhancing psychological wellbeing, and
preventing premature death.2 3 Injuries are an unintended
consequence of physical activity. Little is known about sport
and recreational injuries (referred to as recreational injuries
in this paper), particularly among older persons. This paper
describes recreational injuries among older adults age >65
years.
Increasing physical activity among all Americans is a
national health goal and there have been successful efforts to
improve rates of participation.4 A Healthy People 2010
(HP2010) objective for the United States is to raise to 30%
the proportion of all Americans who engage in moderate
physical activity for 30 minutes at least five times a week. The
1997 baseline showed 15% of Americans, including 14% of
older Americans, met this goal.5 One significant effort to
achieve this objective is the National Blueprint, Increasing
Physical Activity Among Adults Age 50 and Older.6 This proposal
was developed by a collaboration of governmental and
private organizations interested in physical fitness and aging.
Implementation will lead to greater numbers of older persons
engaging in physical activity. While increased physical
activity will have an overall positive effect on health, it also
will increase exposure to the possibility of injury.
We know very little about recreational injuries, especially
among older adults. Gotsch et al analyzed National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP)
data and reported that during July 2000 to June 2001 there
were 4.3 million recreational injuries treated in United States
emergency departments.7 The recreational injury rate for
persons >45 years old was 4.3/1000 for men and 2.2/1000 for
women.7 However, these authors did not examine injury rates
for adults age >65 years. Hootman and colleagues surveyed a
select population of seniors that included 1569 community
dwelling persons >60 years old who were enrolled in a
preventive medicine clinic exercise program. They found that
17.5% of the respondents reported they had sustained an
activity related lower extremity injury to soft tissue or bone.8
For the general population of older persons, many of whom
are not engaged in fitness activities, the recreational injury
rate likely is markedly lower.
The rapid growth in the proportion of Americans age >65
years old suggests that the number of recreational injuries
treated in emergency departments will grow if efforts at
increasing physical activity among older Americans succeed.
It is important to characterize recreational injuries to help us
understand the activities associated with higher risk for
injury and the mechanisms of injury so that strategies can be
developed and implemented to prevent these injuries. In this
paper, we analyzed NEISS-AIP data to describe non-fatal
recreational injuries among older adults treated in emergency
departments and provide national estimates of the number of
injuries, types of recreational activities, and diagnoses.
METHODS
We analyzed data from the NEISS-AIP from 1 January 2001
to 31 December 2001 to estimate the number and rate of
recreational injuries among older adults in the United States
(defined as adults age >65). The Northeastern Ohio
Universities College of Medicine Institutional Review Board
exempted this secondary analysis of public data from review.
NEISS-AIP is operated by the United States Consumer
Product Safety Commission and collects data on initial visits
for all types and causes of injuries treated in United States
emergency departments.9 NEISS-AIP data are drawn from a
nationally representative subsample of 66 out of 100 NEISS
hospitals, selected as a stratified probability sample of
hospitals in the United States and its territories with a
minimum of six beds and a 24 hour emergency department.
NEISS-AIP provides data on approximately 500 000 injury

and consumer product related emergency department cases
each year.
Each case was assigned a sample weight based on the
inverse probability of the hospital being selected. Confidence
intervals (CIs) were calculated by using a direct variance
estimation procedure that accounted for the sample weights
and complex sample design. Rates were calculated by using
2001 United States Census Bureau population estimates.
NEISS-AIP defines a recreational injury as one occurring
during organized and unorganized activity whether or not
work or product related. Injury is defined as bodily harm
resulting from exposure to an external substance. NEISS
classified each case into one of 39 mutually exclusive sport/
recreation categories (see box 1) based on an algorithm that
included the consumer product involved (for example, bicycle
or golf cart) and a two line description of the event. Falls
occurring on pool decks were classed as recreational injury
when there was clear evidence from the two line summary
that the person was swimming. Golf carts are battery
powered four wheel vehicles frequently used for transporta-
tion of players and equipment during golf matches. Their use
is mandatory on many courses that cater to retirees. They also
are used for transportation in retirement communities and
elsewhere. We classified golf cart injuries as recreational
unless there was clear evidence that it was not. We elected to
define all falls while walking as recreational injuries.
Cases were excluded if the cause was violence related or
the principal diagnosis was illness. Also excluded were cases
of pain only, psychological harm only, contact dermatitis,
adverse effect of surgery or therapeutic drugs, or the patient
was dead on arrival or died in the emergency department.
Potential cases in our analyses were >65 years old and
initially identified using the NEISS-AIP definition of a
recreational injury. The authors then independently reviewed
the two line narrative and identified injuries related to
participation in a recreational activity. Differences were
discussed and resolved.
Excluded cases were those that:
N Involved sports/recreation equipment or apparel but had
no evidence in the narrative that the person was engaged
in a recreational activity at the time the injury occurred
(for example, was moving or repairing equipment, had
equipment fall on them, was injured near a swimming
pool with no evidence of swimming).
N Involved a powered scooter, a four wheeler or all-terrain
vehicle at home because these were regarded primarily as
forms of transportation.
N Resulted from, or was incidental to, a ``grand parenting
activity'' (for example, struck by a child who fell off a
swing).
Also excluded were cases in which the person was a
spectator at a sport or recreational event or when an injury
was related to an occupational activity.
RESULTS
There were an estimated 62 164 (95% CI 35 570 to 88 758)
persons >65 years old treated in emergency departments for
injuries sustained while participating in recreational activ-
ities. Six thousand two hundred (10%, 95% CI 5.8% to14.2%)
of these were hospitalized. Table 1 shows that the injury rate
for men was 60% higher than the rate for women, and the
rates for both sexes decreased as age increased. Forty percent
(95% CI 6.4% to 73.8%) of the injuries occurred in a sports
venue, 13% at home, and 11% in the street (data not shown).
Figure 1 depicts the distribution of activities associated
with non-fatal recreational injuries for men and women.
Approximately 70% of injuries occurred as a result of five
categories of activity: bicycling, exercising, fishing, golfing,
and snow skiing. However, older men and women were
injured in a wide variety of activities as seen by the large
proportion characterized as ``other'' injuries (see box 1).
Exercise was the activity most often associated with injury
occurrence. Thirty percent of women and 16% of men were
injured while exercising (which included walking, running,
Tai Chi, equipment, and exercise classes). Bicycling, snow
skiing, and exercise were virtually equal as sources of injury
for men, closely followed by golf and fishing. Bicycling was
the second leading source of recreational injuries among
women. Snow skiing ranked fourth for women, but the
frequency was similar to bicycling and golf. Fishing was a
common source of injuries for men but not for women. Most
of the fishing injuries were foreign body (fishhook) injuries

but exposure and insect bites were also sources of injuries.
Many of the golf cart injuries common among men and
women resulted from inappropriate operation of golf carts
(for example, tipping on a slope, driving while impaired).
The single most common type of all non-fatal injuries
treated in emergency departments was fracture (table 2).
Fractures comprised 27% of all injuries and were more
common among women. One third of women were treated
for fractures compared with one fifth of men. Women also
were more likely to suffer sprains and strains, the second
leading injury diagnosis for both sexes. Internal injury was
the least common consequence of recreational activities and
occurred in less than 5% of all cases.
Table 3 presents the distribution of non-fatal injuries
among different body sites. The pattern for location of
injuries was similar for men and women. Extremities were
the most common site and accounted for half of all injuries.
While the overall picture is similar, it is worth noting that one
third of injuries for women compared with one fifth of
injuries for men were to the leg and foot.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report of non-fatal
recreational injuries sustained by older adults treated in
emergency departments. The injuries sustained by persons in
this study reflect the current population based rates of
participation in sports and recreational activities by older
adults. With the changing demographics and the promotion
of physical activity, these rates will likely increase and
recreational injuries among older adults will become a more
pressing public health issue.
Older adults engaged in a variety of recreational activities.
Exercise (including walking, equipment use, and exercise
classes), bicycling, snow skiing, golf, and fishing were
responsible for the majority of recreational injuries. These
injuries ranged from serious that are associated with
significant morbidity and mortality (for example, fractures)
to minor that required little medical attention (for example, a
fishhook in the finger).
While many injuries to older adults that are treated in the
emergency department may appear to be minor, they may
have important long term consequences. Such injuries can
seriously affect an older person's ability to function inde-
pendently. Shapiro and coworkers followed up a group of
persons >65 years old who were treated in the emergency
department for minor injuries (including 26% fracture.) They
found that 7% of them had decreased scores in fundamental
activities of daily living and 23% had decreased scores in
instrumental activities of daily living.10
Older people are not commonly the focus of injury
prevention programs. Given these results, it appears that
designing injury prevention programs for older adults would

Bicycling, a common source of recreational injuries, can be
made safer through environmental modifications that sepa-
rate bicycles from traffic.11 Such efforts will benefit cyclists of
all ages. Wearing protective equipment when cycling is
another effective injury prevention strategy,12 and older
adults should be encouraged to adopt such safety measures.
Operating golf carts inappropriately (for example, striking
objects, tipping the cart, and attempting to board a moving
cart) resulted in many recreational injuries. Strategies such as
education programs that focus on using golf carts safely may
reduce such injuries.
Our estimates of the number of recreational injuries among
older adults are subject to some important limitations. First,
we did not have information on how frequently older adults
participated in the various recreational activities. Thus, we
did not have the ability to calculate the true risk for the
information that we reported. We used census data to
calculate rates for population groups. Rates calculated with
time engaged in an activity (exposure) as the denominator
may reveal a different picture.
Second, the report included only non-fatal injuries treated
in hospital emergency departments. We are missing injuries
that were treated in physicians' offices, free standing medical
centers or other clinics, those that did not require medical
attention, and fatal injuries. People who are injured are likely
to go to the emergency department for treatment. Injuries
accounted for 37% of initial emergency department visits13
compared with about 7% (56.4 million) of physician visits
(including both initial treatment and follow up care).14 No
doubt many of the office visits are to follow up care received
in the emergency department. Additionally, Kinney and
Gerson reported that in a Midwestern midsize city, 80% of
persons who had a private physician were first treated for an
injury at a free standing emergency medical center.15 This
adds further support that private physicians' offices are often
not the first place injured persons visit for treatment. We
elected to focus on non-fatal injuries because information

about deaths is not well captured by NEISS-AIP. Categorizing
fatal recreational injuries would require details that are often
missing in emergency department records of fatal events.
A third limitation was that the algorithm used to classify
an injury relies on both the product involved and a two line
description of the event. These descriptions often were
sketchy and it was difficult to determine if the person was
engaged in a recreational activity or if the event was classified
as recreational because of the product. For example, there
were a number of cases where a person fell on a pool deck. It
was difficult to determine if the person was on the deck
because they were swimming or they just happened to fall
while on the deck for other reasons. We included as
recreational injury only those cases in which there was clear
evidence from the two line summary that the person was
swimming. Similarly, for injuries that involved golf carts, it
was not always clear whether the person was using the cart
as part of a golf game or for transportation. We assumed that
it was recreational unless there was clear evidence that it was
not. Another difficult decision was if a fall occurred while
walking. We elected to define all falls while walking as
recreational injuries. Although we did our best to classify
injuries, the limited information likely contributed to some
misclassification.
NEISS-AIP is an important injury surveillance system.
However, it is constrained by the information available in the
medical record as well as the limited space provided by the
two line narrative description. It would be helpful if
information about the use of safety equipment were included
in the medical record. It is important for emergency
physicians to ask about use of protective equipment and to
record whether it was used. In addition to recording valuable
information, this interaction provides an opportunity for the
physician to counsel the patient and family about safety and
the importance of using protective equipment. Although only
one complete year of data is currently available, NEISS-AIP
will provide ongoing surveillance of recreational injuries and
in future permit analyses of injury trends.
CONCLUSIONS
We described the epidemiology of recreational injuries among
older adults treated in emergency departments. Older adults
were injured while participating in a wide variety of
recreational activities, particularly while bicycling and exer-
cising. Fractures were common and women were more likely
than men to suffer fractures. Many of these injuries are
potentially preventable. As more persons engage in recrea-
tional activities, applying known injury prevention strategies
will help to reduce the incidence of these injuries.

Key points
N This study is the first to focus on non-fatal recreational
injuries among persons >65 years old treated in
emergency departments.
N Although many activities were responsible for injuries,
bicycling and exercise were the largest contributors to
the burden of injury. Fractures and sprains were the
most common injuries.
N The lack of information about the frequency, duration,
and intensity with which older adults engaged in these
activities (exposure) seriously limited our ability to
identify high risk activities.
N Accurately documenting the circumstances surrounding
recreational injuries, including the use of protective
devices, is crucial to our understanding both the
sources of injuries and possible preventive interven-
tions.
N We need to pay more attention to preventing sports
and recreational injuries in this increasingly active
population.
