Abstract
Background Obesity is one of the most important modifiable
risk factors for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. The aim of
this study was to examine the prevalence of diabetes with
increasing severity of obesity and the distribution of HbA1c
levels in diabetics participating in the latest National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods Data from a representative sample of adults with
diabetes participating in the NHANES between 1999 and
2006 were reviewed. The prevalence of diabetes and levels
of fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and HbA1c were
examined across different weight classes with normal
weight, overweight, and obesity classes 1, 2, and 3 were
defined as body mass index (BMI) of <25.0, 25.0­29.9,
30.0­34.9, 35.0­39.9, and equal to 40.0, respectively. The
distribution of HbA1c levels among adults with diabetes
was also examined.
Results There were 2,894 adults with diabetes (13.6%)
among the 21,205 surveyed participants. Among the adults
with diabetes, the mean age was 59 years, the mean fasting
glucose was 155±2 mg/dl, and the mean HbA1c was 7.2%;
80.3% of diabetics were considered overweight (BMI25)
and 49.1% of diabetics were considered obese (BMI30).
The prevalence of adults with diabetes increased with
increasing weight classes, from 8% for normal weight
individuals to 43% for individuals with obesity class 3; the
distribution of HbA1c levels were considered as good
(<7.0%) in 60%, fair (7.0­8.0%) in 17%, and poor (>8.0%)
in 23%. The mean fasting glucose and HbA1c levels were
highest for diabetics with BMI <25.0, suggesting a state of
higher severity of disease. Mean insulin and c-peptide
levels were highest for diabetics with BMI=35.0, suggest-
ing a state of insulin resistance.
Conclusions In a nationally representative sample of US
adults, the prevalence of diabetes increases with increasing
weight classes. Nearly one fourth of adults with diabetes
have poor glycemic control and nearly half of adult
diabetics are considered obese suggesting that weight loss
is an important intervention in an effort to reduce the
impact of diabetes on the health care system.

Introduction
The crude prevalence of total diabetes in adult's age equal
to 20 years is 9.6% or 20.4 million in the US and many
diabetic individuals are obese [1]. Obesity is one of the
most important modifiable risk factors for the prevention of
type 2 diabetes; however, obesity is an epidemic in the US.
Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2003­2004 indicate
that among adults aged 20 to 39 years, 28.5% are obese
while 36.8% of adults aged 40 to 59 years and 31.0% of
those aged 60 years or older are obese, defined as a body
mass index (BMI) of 30.0 or higher [2]. Similarly, during a

20-year period (1976­2006), the mean BMI among adults
with type 2 diabetes increased from 29.2 to 34.2 kg/m [2]
[3]. Excess weight has been shown to be associated with an
increased prevalence of type II diabetes, gastroesophageal
reflux, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and certain cancers and
both obesity and diabetes are associated with an increased
risk for mortality, particularly from cardiovascular disease
[4­6]. The aim of this study was to (1) determine the
prevalence of obesity and the state of glycemic control
among diabetics and (2) examine the association between
obesity and diabetes in a large cohort of US individuals
participating in the 1999 to 2006 NHANES.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population
The NHANES survey is conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics, which is part of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. The NHANES provides cross-
sectional data on the health and nutrition of the US population.
The survey examines a nationally representative complex,
multistage probability sample of about 5,000 US civilians
each year, located within 15 counties across the country. The
NHANES survey consists of an extensive health information
interview, a complete physical examination, and extensive
laboratory testing. The physical examinations are performed
in a mobile examination center. Data from the four latest
NHANES surveys were merged for analysis (1999­2000,
2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006).
Data files extracted for this study included demographic
information, systolic blood pressure measurements, medical
disease history, smoking history, and laboratory measures
(lipid profile and fasting glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and
hemoglobin A1C levels). Height and weight were measured
using standardized protocols. Participants were considered
to have diabetes mellitus if they were told by their doctor
they have diabetes, had a fasting plasma glucose concen-
tration of 125 mg/dL, had a hemoglobin A1C level of
6.0%, or use anti-diabetic medication(s) such as insulin or
oral hypoglycemic agents.
Definition of Obesity
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters. The National Heart, Lung, and
Blood Institute's definition for overweight and obesity were
used to categorize the degree of obesity. A BMI <18.5 was
categorized as underweight; a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
was categorized as normal weight class; a BMI between
25.0 and 29.9 was categorized as overweight; a BMI
between 30.0 and 34.9 was categorized as obesity class 1; a
BMI between 35.0 and 39.9 was categorized as obesity
class 2; and a BMI 40.0 was categorized as obesity class
3. In this study, we did not differentiate between normal
weight and underweight classes.
Endpoints
We categorized adults with diabetes according to increasing
weight classes and also analyzed the levels of fasting
glucose, insulin, c-peptide, and hemoglobin A1C across the
classes of obesity. Among individuals with diabetes, the
levels of HbA1c was categorized as good (<7.0%), fair
(7.0­8.0%), and poor control (>8.0%) [7].
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted in SAS 9.1 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Due to the NHANES' complex
probability sampling of the US population, sample weights,
stratification, and clustering of the sampling design were
incorporated into all SAS survey procedures to ensure the
correct estimation of standard errors, confidence intervals, and
P values. An 8-year sample weight was created according to
the NHANES analytic guidelines for the combined 1999­
2006 data by assigning one half of the 4-year weight for
1999­2002 if a participant was sampled in 1999­2002 and
assigning one fourth of the 2-year weight for those
sampled in 2003­2006. The stratification and clustering
variables were used in all analyses. Statistical signifi-
cance was set at P values <0.05.
Results
Table 1 lists the demographics of the study population from
1999 to 2006 according to BMI. There were 2,894 adults
with diabetes (13.6%) among 21,205 surveyed participants.
Among adults with diabetes, there were 596 individuals
with a BMI <25.0; 902 individuals with a BMI of 25.0­
29.9; 710 individuals with a BMI of 30.0­34.9; 399
individuals with a BMI of 35.0­39.9; and 314 individuals
with a BMI equal to 40.0. The prevalence of diabetes was
lowest for the group with BMI <25.0 (8%). The prevalence
of diabetes almost doubled between normal weight vs.
overweight class (8% vs. 15%). The prevalence of diabetes
continues to increase with the increasing class of obesity
and was highest for class 3 obesity (43%).
Among adults with diabetes, the prevalence of individ-
uals considered as overweight or higher (BMI25) was
80.3%; and the prevalence of obesity or higher (BMI=30)
was 49.1%. For the entire cohort of adults with diabetes,
the mean hemoglobin A1C level was 7.2±0.0 and the levels
were highest for individuals with BMI <25.0. Table 2 lists

the changes in levels of hemoglobin A1C, glucose, insulin,
and c-peptide according to weight classes: the mean fasting
glucose level was 155±2 mg/dl and the levels were highest
for individuals with BMI <30.0; the mean insulin level was
22±1.0 U/ml and the levels were highest for individuals
with BMI equal to 40.0; the mean c-peptide level was 1.2±
0.0 nmol/l and the levels were highest for individuals with
BMI equal to 40.0.
Categories of levels of hemoglobin A1C among diabetic
individuals are depicted in Table 3. Of the adults with
diabetes, good glycemic control (hemoglobin A1C less than
7.0%) was observed in 60%; adequate control (hemoglobin
A1C between 7.0% and 8.0%) was observed in 17%; and
poor control (hemoglobin A1C >8.0%) was observed in
23%.
Discussion
The major finding of this study is the clear association
between obesity and diabetes in a large, representative
sample of the US population. In this cross-sectional survey
of adults with diabetes, the lowest prevalence for diabetes
was found in individuals with normal weight (BMI <25.0).
The prevalence of diabetes increased throughout the range
of obesity classes. Nearly a quarter of adults with diabetes
have poor glycemic control and nearly half of the
individuals with diabetes are considered obese.
The prevalence of diabetes from our study is similar to
the findings from Cowie and colleagues who reported the
crude prevalence of total diabetes in adults age=20 years
was 9.6% with another 3.5% of adults at high risk for
diabetes with hemoglobin A1C between 6.0% and 6.5%
[1]. The prevalence of obesity among diabetic in our study
is much higher than the reported prevalence of obesity in
the general US adult population. In our study, the
prevalence of obesity among adults with diabetes was
49.1% while Flegal and colleagues reported the prevalence
of obesity was 32.2% among US adult men and 35.5%
among adult women [8]. The glycemic control for
individuals with diabetes is improving during the past
decade. Saaddine et al. reported that the hemoglobin A1C
level between 6% and 8% increased from 34.2% in 1998­
1994 to 47.0% in 1999­2002 [9]. In our study, the
proportion of individuals with hemoglobin A1C level
between 6% and 8% was 77%. Similarly, the mean
hemoglobin A1C level among individuals with diabetes
was reported by Hoerger and colleagues to decrease from
7.82% in 1999­2000 to 7.18% in 2003­2004. The mean
hemoglobin A1C level in our study was 7.2% [10].
In this study, we also found the mean fasting glucose and
HbA1c levels were highest for diabetics with BMI <25.0,

suggesting a state of higher severity of disease. Mean
insulin and c-peptide levels were highest for diabetics with
BMI equal to 35.0, suggesting a state of insulin resistance.
These results may suggest that more diabetics within
normal weight range have type 1 classification and
diabetes in the obese are mostly type 2 with associated
insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes account for 90­95%
of those with diabetes and encompasses individuals who
have insulin resistance and usually have relative insulin
deficiency.
The finding of a high prevalence of obesity in adults
with diabetes from this study suggests that more effort
should be taken to combat obesity since obesity is a
modifiable risk factor for the development of diabetes.
These efforts should include prevention of obesity in
combination with medical and surgical treatments of
obesity. The look AHEAD trial is one of the largest trials
of intentional weight loss in diabetics. This is a multi-
centered, randomized, controlled trial of 5,145 individuals
with type 2 diabetes with BMI >25 who were randomized
to undergo intensive lifestyle intervention compared with
diabetes support and education (control group). Participants
randomized to lifestyle intervention lost an average of 8.6%
of their initial weight compared to 0.7% in the control
group [11]. A greater proportion of the individuals in the
lifestyle intervention group had reduction in diabetes,
hypertension, and lipid-lowering medications. The mean
hemoglobin A1C level improved significantly more in the
lifestyle intervention than control participants [11]. Bariatric
surgery has also been shown to improve and even induce
remission of diabetes in the morbidly obese. In a large study
on 240 patients with diabetes or have impaired fasting
glucose levels, Schauer et al. [12] reported that resolution of
diabetes was achieved in 83% of patients and patients with a
short duration of the disease (<5 years), mildest form of
diabetes, and the greatest weight loss were more likely
to achieve complete remission of diabetes. In a meta-
analysis of 19 studies and 11,175 patients on the effect
of bariatric surgery on diabetes, Buchwald et al.
reported that 78.1% of diabetic patients had complete
resolution and diabetes was improved or resolved in
86.6% of patients; diabetes resolution was greatest for
patients undergoing biliopancreatic diversion/duodenal
switch, followed by gastric bypass, and least for
banding procedures [13]. In addition to the findings of
improvement of diabetes with bariatric surgery, several
recent studies have shown improved survival rates for
morbidly obese individuals who underwent bariatric
surgery compared to the control individuals without
surgical intervention [14, 15]. Adams and colleagues
reported a retrospective cohort study comparing 7,925
morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery
to 7,925 severely obese control subjects and found that the
cause-specific mortality related to diabetes decreased by
88% in the surgical group during a mean follow-up of
7.1 years [14]. In a landmark paper published in 2004
comparing 2,010 severely obese subjects who underwent
bariatric surgery compared to 2,037 control subjects,
Sjostrom and colleagues reported that the incidence of
diabetes was significantly lower within the surgery group
compares to control group at 2 and 10 years follow-up
[16]. Of the 1,056 patients with a 10-year follow-up, the
incidence of diabetes in the control group was 24% while the
incidence of diabetes in the surgical group was 7% [16]. Lastly,
prevention of obesity is a key public health initiative in an
attempt to reduce the incidence of obesity and diabetes risk.
Currently, Head Start is the largest federally funded early
childhood obesity education program in the United States. In
a survey of 1,583 Head Start programs, Whitaker and
colleagues reported that most Head Start programs are doing
more to support healthy eating and gross motor activity than
required by federal requirement standards [17].
Our study shows a clear association between obesity and
diabetes, using a large nationwide database. However, there
are notable limitations in the use and interpretation of this
observational data. The NHANES survey is a series of
cross-sectional analyses of the US population. Therefore,
longitudinal data across study years is not provided, and no
temporal analyses can be conducted. As with all survey
data, there are inherent limitations in the collection
methods, which can lead to sampling error, measurement
error, and reporting bias.
Conclusions
In summary, our findings demonstrate an association
between increasing obesity classes and increasing preva-
lence of diabetes. Nearly one fourth of adults with diabetes
have poor glycemic control and nearly half of adult
diabetics are considered obese based on an 8-year period
(1999­2006) data from a cross-sectional representative of
the US adult population. An important implication from
