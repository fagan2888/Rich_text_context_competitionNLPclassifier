Introduction
Political scientists seeking to understand party systems have
long relied on sociological (or "social cleavage") explana-
tions (e.g. Lipset and Rokkan, 1967; Petrocik, 1981). The
core assumption is that racial, ethnic, religious, and class
divisions have served as the basis for numerous political
parties, including those in the US (Burnham, 1970). Recent
scholarship, however, also documents the importance of
residential location in shaping people's partisanship (e.g.
Baybeck, 2006; Gainsborough, 2005; Gimpel and
Schuknecht, 2004). For instance, proximity to a different
group might alter and intensify certain political attitudes.
Close contact with an out-group may foster congruent polit-
ical behavior, while the sizable presence of an out-group in
a spatially segregated setting may breed political conflict.
With respect to the contextual influence of place, in addi-
tion to the traditional urban­rural divide (Gimpel and
Karnes, 2006), studies also note the importance of suburban
voters, whose rise to prominence after the post-World War II
housing boom created a large swing group (Gainsborough,
2005). This development has not been lost on campaigns,
which now assiduously court suburban voters; for while
this group is typically seen as pro-Republican, it is only
marginally so (McKee and Shaw, 2003) and losses among
suburban voters in the collar counties surrounding northern
cities have recently tilted states such as Michigan,
Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to the Democrats (Donald
Trump's 2016 victories in these states notwithstanding).
A growing interest in suburban voting highlights how
little we know about the shaping of political attitudes and
behavior as a consequence of where people live and the
racial composition of those settings.1 In this research note
we examine the interactive relationship between population
density, racial context, and the preferences of black and
white voters in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.
The 2008 and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election
Study (CCES) data are ideal for testing these dynamics

Abstract
Voting is a complex dynamic driven by the sociopolitical attributes of individuals and how they are spatially located
in proximity to similar or different populations. In this research note we examine how presidential vote choice is
influenced by the interaction between the population density and racial composition of the ZIP code of respondents in
the 2008 and 2012 Cooperative Congressional Election Studies. Our findings reveal interesting patterns with respect to
a respondent's racial background. For whites in racially diverse settings, as density increases, so does support for Obama.
By contrast, for blacks the spatial and racial context has almost no effect, providing evidence in support of the claim that
this is a group strongly attached to the Democratic Party and its co-racial standard-bearer.

because of the large sample size and ZIP code-level geolo-
cation. The ZIP code (ZC) indicator enables us to assign
fine grain census data on population density and racial
composition (e.g. percent white) to each survey respondent
and thus determine if contextual features influence the like-
lihood of voting for Barack Obama.
Voting patterns vary a lot as the political landscape
moves from the city to the suburb to the country (McKee
and Teigen, 2009), yet few studies utilize the more exacting
measure of ZIP code-level population density to gauge its
effect on voter preferences. Rather, studies have relied on
simple contrasts between urban, suburban, and rural voters.
Further, a location's racial composition can influence vot-
ing behavior but scholars typically ignore its interaction
with residential density (but see Voss, 1996; Wright, 1976).
In this study, we eschew coarse urban/suburban/rural dis-
tinctions and instead assess the role of density and the racial
composition of a respondent's environment in shaping
presidential voting behavior, particularly given the racial
profile of the individual. Controlling for numerous factors,
ZC density registers a marked effect on presidential vote
choice, whereas racial composition alone does not. Limiting
the analysis to a specific race, we find that blacks appear
almost immune to the contextual features of density and
racial composition. By contrast, white respondents show
considerable sensitivity to density and racial composition:
indicating racial threat in high-minority/low-density envi-
ronments while embracing Obama's candidacy in high-
minority/high-density locations.
Data and methods
We assign 2010 census data on population density (logged
density per square mile) and racial composition (percent
white; percent black) to the ZIP code of each respondent in
the 2008 and 2012 CCES. We then run logistic regressions
with a binary vote choice variable coded: 1 = Obama; 0 =
McCain; 1 = Obama; and 0 = Romney. Controls include:
party affiliation (Republican, Democrat, independent as
omitted category); ideology (1 = conservative); race (black,
Latino, white as omitted category); gender (1 = female);
marital status (1 = married); education (1 = college gradu-
ate); income (>$100,000); logged ZC population density;
age deciles (30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s); and region (South,
Midwest, Mountains/Plains, Pacific Coast, Northeast as
omitted category)2 (due to space constraints, age and region
estimates are not shown in Table 1, but are displayed in
Table A3 of the online Appendix).3
We run the same five models for 2008 (1­5) and 2012
(6­10). The first contains the ZC percent white, the second
includes the ZC percent black (excludes ZC percent white
due to correlation), the third and fourth interact ZC density
with ZC percent white while limiting respondents by race:
black and white, respectively. Finally, the fifth model includes
only whites and interacts ZC density with ZC percent black.4
Results
First, we display the distribution of the ZC percent white
and ZC percent black, respectively for white and black
respondents in the 2008 and 2012 CCES. The regression
estimates follow, and then we show a series of Figures that
plot the likelihood of voting for Barack Obama among
black and white respondents according to ZC density and
two levels of ZC racial composition. Finally, in the last two
Figures we highlight the notable variation in white voting
behavior based on the ZC percent black while comparing
low- and high-density areas.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are violin plots of the distribution
of percent white and percent black population in the ZCs of
white and black respondents in the 2008 and 2012 CCES.
Compared to box plots, violin plots present a richer visual
display of frequency distributions of the data as they range
from their minimum to maximum values. In Figure 1(a) we
see that most white respondents reside in ZCs with high
white populations, whereas black respondents live in set-
tings with a broader range of percent white residents.
Complementarily, Figure 1(b) reveals the very low black
population in ZCs inhabited by most whites, while blacks
live in ZCs with a decidedly higher variation in the African
American population.
Table 1 presents our models of the likelihood of voting for
Barack Obama. Models 1 and 6 (2008 and 2012) include
white ZC percent and Models 2 and 7 include the black ZC
percent. Neither variable is significant but in these models
density registers a large effect: the increase in voting for
Obama across the density range goes from about 49% in the
most sparsely populated ZCs to an over 58% chance of vot-
ing for Obama for respondents in the most densely populated
areas (see Figures A1­A2 in the online Appendix). Models 3
and 8 (2008 and 2012) are confined to blacks, and Models 4
and 9 to whites, and each includes an interaction between
density and white ZC percent. This interaction only attains
significance in the whites-only models (4 and 9), but signifi-
cant differences can register along certain ranges of the inter-
action so we present predicted probabilities of voting for
Obama in Figures 2(a)­(d) according to density and two lev-
els of white ZC percent (low = 20%, high = 95%).
Figures 2(a)­(b) present results for black voters in 2008
and 2012 (Models 3 and 8). It is remarkable how little
movement in the likelihood of voting for Obama is based
on density and ZC racial composition. Surely Obama him-
self partly explains this lack of variation in voting behavior,
but it also seems African Americans' stalwart Democratic
support (Fauntroy, 2007) is impervious to these contextual
factors. The almost inelastic and consensus black vote for
Obama, speaks loudly to the notion of a linked fate/racial
identity manifested in vote choice (Dawson, 1994; Tate,
1993).5
Figures 2(c)­(d) present results for white voters in 2008
and 2012 (Models 4 and 9). In high-white ZCs, density has

a marginal positive effect on voting for Obama. However,
in high-minority ZCs, density has a substantial effect on
white voting behavior. There is evidence of both racial
threat and the contact hypothesis (Sigelman and Welch,
1993); that is, whites in rural, high-minority locales exhibit
a very low probability of voting for Obama (racial threat),
whereas whites in the most urban (densest), high-minority
settings are more likely to vote for Obama than his two
Republican opponents (contact hypothesis). Whites spa-
tially segregated from a high-minority population in a rural

environment are much less supportive of Obama and this
behavior is reminiscent of the classic southern story of
racial threat (Key, 1949; Wright, 1976). By contrast, urban
whites living in close proximity to majority­minority pop-
ulations resemble their minority neighbors in their political
behavior since they are more inclined to vote for Obama.
Figures 3(a)­(b) (Models 5 and 10 in 2008 and 2012)
expand upon the evidence in Figures 2(c)­(d) by contrast-
ing the voting behavior of whites based on the relationship
between ZC black percent and two levels of population
density (low = 25th percentile, high = 75th percentile).
Voting for Obama hardly varies in ZCs with no African
Americans, irrespective of density (low or high). As the ZC
percent black increases, whites in high-density (urban) set-
tings show very little movement in the likelihood of voting
for Obama (see the probability range in Table A2 in the
online Appendix), whereas whites in low-density (rural)
locales are decidedly more likely to vote Republican.6
Conclusion
Political observers have long understood that environmen-
tal factors can have a pronounced effect on voting behavior.
The compositional makeup of a location does much to
explain its politics, but it is also true that the relative prox-
imity in which different groups interact shapes the prefer-
ences of voters (Gimpel and Schuknecht, 2004). Where
individuals live and who their neighbors are, shapes how
individuals vote, even controlling for numerous sociopoliti-
cal attributes.
White voters exhibit the most political malleability in set-
tings that vary with respect to density and racial composition.
By contrast, black voting behavior in 2008 and 2012 is remark-
able for its resistance to these contextual factors. Perhaps this
is no surprise because, as a group, African Americans over-
whelmingly favor one political party. Nonetheless, the almost
inelastic voting behavior ofAfricanAmericans when the racial
composition and density of the ZIP code varies is noteworthy.
Attachment to the Democratic Party and a black President
seems to explain this. However, future research can make use
of the 2016 CCES ­ the first time this survey will examine
presidential voting behavior when neither candidate is named
Barack Obama nor of African American descent ­ to confirm
this relationship between ZIP code-level density, racial com-
position, and voting behavior.

4. Note that we are assuming that the population density of an
individual's residential location has an impact on voting.
While the causal arrow may point in the opposite direction,
we are dubious. Some people may choose to live in places
where a particular (shared) political viewpoint is dominant
(see Bishop, 2008), but it seems unlikely to us that a particu-
lar partisan preference would lead to a desire to live within a
certain distance from like-minded people.
5. One might reasonably question whether these effects are
idiosyncratic to the Obama elections. Given the consistency
of blacks' support for Democratic presidential candidates in
recent "non-Obama" elections (blacks went for Clinton by
80 points in 2016, for Kerry by 77 points in 2004, and for
Gore by 82 points in 2000), it seems likely the general pat-
terns uncovered here are generalizable to other years.
6. Regional distinctiveness also explains white voters'tendency
to prefer Obama. To understand regional differences vis-à-vis
the dynamic between population and racial context, we ran a
model similar to Model 4 in Table 1, but instead of the two-
way interaction, it included a three-way interaction between
a regional dummy for the South, percent black in respond-
ents' ZC, and population density. In the 2008 presidential
election, white southerners living in high-density ZIP codes
(75 percentile density) became less likely to vote for Obama
as the number of blacks living around them increased. This
finding contrasts with non-southern whites in high-density
areas, as their preference for Obama was insensitive to their
racial context. We performed the same analysis for the 2012
presidential election and found no statistically significant
differences in the voter preferences of southern whites and
non-southern whites.
