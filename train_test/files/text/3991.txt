Introduction
Diabetic vascular complications, including diabetic
nephropathy, are becoming a serious public health concern
in all countries.1 They cause significant physical and psy-
chological morbidity among those patients and imposes a
heavy financial burden on health services. While the
pathogenesis is understood well enough to prevent pro-
gression of diabetic vascular complications, it is still not
sufficiently clear.
Although systemic renin activity is suppressed in dia-
betes, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors exert
renoprotective effects.2 This is possible because the
pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy appears to involve
activation of local/tissue RAS (independently regulated in
each organ). Inhibiting RAS activation is important in
order to prevent the progression of diabetic nephropathy.2
Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, is renoprotective in diabetic
animal models.3­5 It suppresses RAS activity by directly
inhibiting renin activity in the most upstream portion of
RAS.6 Since aliskiren has high affinity for renal tissue and
prolonged activity,7 it should provide good control of
hypertension with strong renoprotective effects. While it is
possible to measure tissue RAS activity, no reports of in
vivo images exist. We developed a novel technique to vis-
ualize tissue renin activity in vivo by utilizing a fluores-
cence resonance energy transfer (FRET) system and
confocal laser microscopy. We used this in vivo imaging
technique to examine the possible involvement of local
RAS in diabetic nephropathy. In addition, we studied the

Abstract
Introduction: We investigated the feasibility of using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer system to image
enzymatic activity in order to evaluate the effects of aliskiren (a direct renin inhibitor) on diabetic nephropathy.
Materials and methods: First, we induced diabetes in C57BL/6J mice using streptozotocin, then treated them with
either aliskiren (25 mg/kg/day) or the angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker valsartan (15 mg/kg/day) for four weeks.
Finally, we utilized renin fluorescence resonance energy transfer substrate to assess renin activity.
Results: Renin activity was much higher in the kidneys of diabetic mice compared to those of the non-diabetic control
mice. While aliskiren inhibited this activity, valsartan did not. We noted that production of reactive oxygen species
intensified and the bioavailability of nitric oxide diminished in the glomeruli of diabetic mice. Aliskiren and valsartan
significantly ameliorated these effects. They suppressed glomerular production of reactive oxygen species and urinary
albumin excretion. In fact, urinary albumin excretion in diabetic mice treated with aliskiren or valsartan was lower than
that in untreated diabetic mice. Furthermore, aliskiren and valsartan significantly reduced glomerular permeability by
maintaining the glomerular endothelial surface layer.
Conclusion: Fluorescence resonance energy transfer could provide a new tool for evaluating tissue and plasma
enzymatic activity.

renoprotective mechanisms of aliskiren and its inhibitory
effect on renin activity.
Methods and materials
Experimental animals
The experimental protocol (No. 11-055) was approved by
the Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation
of the Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan. Male
C57BL/6J mice (six weeks old) were purchased from
Charles River Japan (Kanagawa, Japan). The mice were
housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled room
with a 12-h light­dark cycle. They were fed standard labo-
ratory animal chow and had free access to tap water.
We induced diabetes in the mice (n=40) by intraperito-
neal injection of streptozotocin (STZ; Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, Missouri, USA), at a dose of 50 mg/kg/d for 3 d as
a modified Animal Models of Diabetic Complications
Consortium protocol of multiple low-dose STZ injections.
Blood glucose was measured using Medisafe Mini
(Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). Mice with blood glucose levels
300 mg/dl a week after the final STZ injection (n=30)
were considered diabetic. Six weeks after they developed
diabetes, the mice began a four-week course of either
aliskiren (25 mg/kg/day, n=10), valsartan (15 mg/kg/day,
n=10) or no treatment (n=10). We injected aliskiren into
the peritoneum using an osmotic pump. Valsartan was
administrated by gavage. Same-aged non-diabetic male
mice were used as controls (n=8). At 18 weeks of age,
body weight was recorded, and blood pressure was meas-
ured by the tail-cuff method with an automatic sphyg-
momanometer (BP98A; Softron, Tokyo, Japan). Then, the
mice were placed in metabolic cages for 24 h to collect
urine. We sacrificed them using sevoflurane gas in order to
collect blood samples. Serum creatinine level was meas-
ured using an enzyme assay (Nescoat VLII CRE kit;
Alfresa Pharma, Osaka, Japan). Urinary albumin levels
were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) using a murine microalbuminuria ELISA kit
(Albuwell M; Exocell, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA).
Evaluation of renin activity in vivo using renin
FRET substrate
We obtained renin FRET substrate (5-FAM/QX 520) from
AnaSpec (San Jose, California, USA), and we used a mul-
tiphoton excitation laser-scanning fluorescence micros-
copy confocal microscope system (TCS SP2 AOBS MP;
Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) for this study.
In order to infuse a dye, we placed each mouse under
sevoflurane-induced anesthesia and inserted a catheter into
its right external jugular vein. Afterwards, we made a
15­20 mm dorsal incision under sterile conditions to
exteriorize the left kidney. We removed a cortical slice
less than 1 mm thick to allow imaging of the most super-
ficial glomeruli. Bleeding was minimal and stopped
spontaneously within 2 min. During all procedures and
imaging, the mice's core body temperature was main-
tained at 37°C with a homeothermic table. A 0.1 ml vol-
ume of 70 kDa Texas Red dextran (neutral, excitation
595 nm, emission 615 nm, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) solution (2 mg/ml) was
infused through the jugular venous catheter to identify
glomeruli. Next, for analysis of renin activity, a 0.1 ml
volume of renin FRET substrate solution (0.5 mM) was
infused. The integrating fluorescein intensity in the glo-
merular tufts for 5 s from injection was measured
to evaluate the renin FRET activity as previously
described.8 The result was shown as relative intensity
compared to the control group.
Plasma renin activity assay
Plasma renin activity was determined using a Fluorometric
Sensolyte 520 Mouse ReninAssay Kit (AnaSpec) following
the manufacturer's protocol.
Detection of endothelial surface layer
Sections (4 m thick) were prepared from renal tissue
samples embedded in paraffin and stained with tetrameth-
ylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheatgerm agglu-
tinin (WGA; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California,
USA). Tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated
WGA-stained kidney sections were analyzed using
TCS-NT system software (Leica-Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany). For evaluation of glomerular endothelial sur-
face layer (ESL), percent positive area was measured
with a color image analyzer (WinLoof; Mitani Co., Fukui,
Japan). At least 100 glomeruli at ×400 magnification were
randomly selected from each mouse, and the mean score
was calculated.
In situ detection of nitric oxide and reactive
oxygen species (ROS)
The production levels of nitric oxide and ROS resulting
from nitric oxide synthase (NOS) coupling were imaged
by confocal laser microscopy after renal perfusion of
2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA;
excitation 485 nm, emission 530 nm, Sekisui Medical,
Tokyo, Japan) and diaminorhodamine-4M acetoxyme-
thyl ester (DAR-4M AM; excitation 560 nm, emission
575 nm, Sekisui Medical) with L-arginine as previously
described.9

In vivo imaging of macromolecule hyperfiltration
A multiphoton excitation laser-scanning fluorescence
microscopy confocal microscope system (TCS SP2
AOBS MP; Leica-Microsystems) was used for imaging of
macromolecule hyperfiltration. In vivo imaging of the
glomerular microcirculation was performed as previously
described.8 A 0.1 ml volume of 500 kDa fluorescein­
dextran (2 mg/ml, anionic, excitation 494 nm, emission
521 nm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution was infused
through the jugular venous catheter to identify glomerulus.
To analyze glomerular permeability, a 70-kDa fluorescein­
dextran (2 mg/ml, anionic, excitation 494 nm, emission
521 nm, Thermo Fisher Scientific) solution was infused
through the jugular venous catheter.
Statistical analysis
Values are expressed as mean±standard error of the mean
(SEM). Statistical comparisons were made using the
Mann­Whitney U test or the one-factor analysis of vari-
ance with a Tukey­Kramer test for multiple comparisons.
A p value of <0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Physiologic and biochemical data
Physiologic characteristics of the four groups are listed
in Table 1. The STZ, STZ with aliskiren (STZ+Alis), and
STZ with valsartan (STZ+Val) groups had significantly
lower body weight and higher serum glucose and creati-
nine levels compared to mice in the control group. We
noted that among STZ, STZ+Alis, and STZ+Val groups,
serum glucose levels were similar and serum creatinine
levels did not differ. Meanwhile, blood pressure readings
for mice in the STZ+Alis and STZ+Val groups were
significantly lower than for mice in the control and STZ
groups, but blood pressure readings between STZ+Alis
and STZ+Val groups did not differ. Finally, mice in the
STZ group excreted significantly higher levels of urinary
albumin compared to mice in the control group (Figure 1).
However, mice in the STZ+Alis and STZ+Val groups
excreted significantly less urinary albumin than mice in
the STZ group.
In vivo imaging of renin activity in kidney and
plasma renin activity
We detected in vivo renin activity in the kidneys by inject-
ing renin FRET substrate (see Supplementary Material).
As shown in Figure 2(a), high fluorescence was observed
in the glomeruli of mice in the STZ group compared to the
control group. We noted that while aliskiren suppressed
fluorescence intensity in the STZ group, valsartan did not.
The integrating fluorescein intensity in the glomerular tufts
was significantly increased in the STZ group compared to
the control group (Figure 2(b)). These changes were com-
pletely suppressed by aliskiren, but not valsartan.
Plasma renin activity was assessed with an assay kit
using the FRET system. We found that plasma renin activ-
ity in the STZ group was much higher than in the control
group (Figure 2(c)). Plasma renin activity was also higher
in the STZ group compared to the STZ+Alis group.

In situ detection of ROS/nitric oxide production
and assessment of renal superoxide- production
in mice kidneys
Production of ROS and nitric oxide was evaluated via
confocal laser microscopy of kidney tissue after renal
perfusion of DCFH-DAand DAR-4MAM with L-arginine
(Figure 3(a)). We noted ROS production intensified and
the bioavailability of nitric oxide was diminished in the
glomeruli of mice in the STZ group. However, the effects
of STZ were significantly ameliorated by aliskiren and
valsartan.
Next, we evaluated renal superoxide levels in each
group using lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence
(Figure 3(b)). Production of renal superoxide in the whole

kidneys of mice in the STZ+Alis and STZ+Val groups was
significantly lower than the STZ group.
Evaluation of glomerular endothelial surface layer
Glomerular ESL was detected by WGA lectin staining
(Figure 4(a)). The WGA-stained area on the capillary wall
was significantly smaller in the STZ group compared with
the control group, but aliskiren and valsartan significantly
reduced the effect of STZ on glomerular ESL (Figure 4(b)).
Visualization of glomerular hyperpermeability to
macromolecules
Glomerular hyperfiltration of macromolecules was
visualized by intravenous injection of fluorescein
isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran, as reported previously.8
A very small volume of filtered 70-kDa fluorescein isothi-
ocyanate-labeled dextran was seen in the Bowman's cap-
sule space of the control group (Figure 5), but massive
leakage of labeled dextran occurred in the STZ group.
There was less leakage in the STZ+Alis groups.
Discussion
Although diabetic nephropathy is generally a low renin
state, high glucose levels might stimulate plasma renin
activity by decreasing body volume through osmotic diu-
resis. However, in vivo and in vitro evidence suggest that
local tissue RAS is activated in diabetes,10­14 which may
implicate it in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Our
goal was to develop a technique for visualizing renin activity
in vivo using renin FRET substrate, which would help

elucidate the differences between the renoprotective
effects of renin inhibitors and angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs).
The fluorescence of renin FRET substrate in the glo-
meruli is thought to be reflected plasma renin enzymatic
activity and/or tissue renin activity, which includes
prorenin binding to the (pro)renin receptor (PRR). In
other words, the specificity of this technique for visual-
izing local tissue renin activity might not be high.
However, renin gene and protein expression have been
reported in cultured mesangial cells and podocytes.13,15­17
Moreover, PRR expression has been reported in the
glomerular cells, such as mesangial cells, podocytes, and
vascular walls.18­20 In this study, we observed fluores-
cence that might be from podocytes. Therefore, we rea-
soned that the fluorescence observed in the glomeruli
reflected renin enzymatic activity in the glomeruli. This
technique might be an effective method for evaluating
renin enzymatic activity in vivo.
Peti-Peterdi et al. have used renin FRET substrate
to visualize renin enzymatic activity in freshly dissected
kidney tissue.21 However, no studies have evaluated renin
enzymatic activity in living animals until now. We visual-
ized and evaluated the in vivo renin enzymatic activity
of the glomeruli by intravenously injecting renin FRET
substrate. We found that renin enzymatic activity in mice
injected with STZ was higher than mice in the control
group. Aliskiren suppressed that activity. We also noted
that aliskiren and valsartan ameliorated the effects of
diabetes by decreasing glomerular oxidative stress and
lowering nitric oxide bioavailability. Moreover, both
agents reduced glomerular hyperpermeability in diabetic
mice. By suppressing renal oxidative stress, aliskiren and
valsartan helped maintain the glomerular glycocalyx in
diabetic mice, reducing glomerular hyperpermeability,
which reduced excretion of urinary albumin.
Recent evidence has revealed that the intrarenal RAS
activation is an important factor to the pathogenesis of
renal injury.22 In general, the intrarenal angiotensin II gen-
eration is increased, despite suppression of the systemic
RAS, in diabetic nephropathy.23 In STZ rats, an increase in
renal renin was demonstrated.12 Direct demonstration of
increased renin mRNA in the expanded mesangial area of
kidney tissues from diabetic patients was also shown by in
situ hybridization studies.24 Indeed, local renin production
is increased in the diabetic kidney. Local renin increase
causes the progression of diabetic nephropathy via several
pathways. We showed that both inhibition of renin by
aliskiren and angiotensin receptor blockade by valsartan
are effective for renoprotection in the diabetic kidney. So
inhibition of local RAS, especially blockade of local angi-
otensin II signaling, may be more important for treatment
of diabetic nephropathy.
One limitation of this study is that it is unclear
whether fluorescence of renin FRET substrate reflects
only tissue renin activity. In future studies, researchers
should establish methods to distinguish between plasma
renin activity and tissue renin activity. Another limitation
is the difference between the renoprotective effects of
direct renin inhibitors and ARBs was not clear. Previous
data indicate that aliskiren and valsartan have synergis-
tic protective effects,3 suggesting they may have differ-
ent renoprotective mechanisms, but more time might be
needed to clarify the beneficial effects of these agents.
Furthermore, another limitation is that we used STZ-
induced diabetic mice, which is type 1 diabetes. In clini-
cal medicine, type 2 diabetes is more prevalent than

type 1 diabetes. So further investigations are needed
using type 2 diabetic model mice.
Conclusion
We found that injecting renin FRET substrate intrave-
nously enabled us to visualize renin activity in the glomer-
uli of living animals. Our imaging technique helped reveal
that although both aliskiren and valsartan significantly
inhibited urinary albumin excretion in diabetic mice, only
aliskiren significantly inhibited renin bioactivity. Since no
difference was found between the protective effects of
aliskiren and valsartan against nephropathy, further exami-
nation is needed.
