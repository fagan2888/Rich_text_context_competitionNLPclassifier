Abstract
Over the last five years, comprehensive national surveys of the cost of post-abortion care (PAC) to
national health systems have been undertaken in Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Colombia using a
specially developed costing methodology--the Post-abortion Care Costing Methodology (PACCM).
The objective of this study is to expand the research findings of these four studies, making use of
their extensive datasets. These studies offer the most complete and consistent estimates of the
cost of PAC to date, and comparing their findings not only provides generalizable implications for
health policies and programs, but also allows an assessment of the PACCM methodology. We
find that the labor cost component varies widely: in Ethiopia and Colombia doctors spend about
30­60% more time with PAC patients than do nurses; in Uganda and Rwanda an opposite pattern
is found. Labor costs range from I$42.80 in Uganda to I$301.30 in Colombia. The cost of drugs and
supplies does not vary greatly, ranging from I$79 in Colombia to I$115 in Rwanda. Capital and
overhead costs are substantial amounting to 52­68% of total PAC costs. Total costs per PAC case
vary from I$334 in Rwanda to I$972 in Colombia. The financial burden of PAC is considerable: the
expense of treating each PAC case is equivalent to around 35% of annual per capita income in
Uganda, 29% in Rwanda and 11% in Colombia. Providing modern methods of contraception to
women with an unmet need would cost just a fraction of the average expenditure on PAC: one year
of modern contraceptive services and supplies cost only 3­12% of the average cost of treating a
PAC patient.
Key words: Abortion, cost, developing countries, post-abortion care
Key messages
· Four recent costing studies, which provide the best estimates of the cost of post-abortion care (PAC) to national health
systems, show that costs per case vary widely, from I$334 in Rwanda to I$972 in Colombia.
· The components of PAC costs--labor, drugs/supplies, overhead and capital--also differ substantially among the four
countries, showing that resource-allocation decisions are important in determining the efficiency with which PAC is pro-
vided to clients.
· The financial burden of PAC is considerable: the expense of treating one PAC case is equivalent to around 33% of an-
nual per capita income in Uganda, 25% in Rwanda and 10% in Colombia.
· Providing modern methods of contraception to women with an unmet need would cost just a fraction of the average
cost of PAC.

Introduction
In 2008, around 21.2 million unsafe induced abortions1 took place
in the developing world (WHO 2011), and between 22 000 and
44 000 women died from abortion-related causes.2 In 2012, an esti-
mated seven million abortions were cared for in health facilities in
developing countries for medical complications that required med-
ical treatment (Singh and Maddow-Zimet 2015). Post-abortion care
(PAC) encompasses the treatment of many types of medical compli-
cations, the most common one being incomplete abortion, ranging
to less common but much more severe ones such as sepsis and uter-
ine perforation.3 Treating unsafe abortions, while essential for wom-
en's health and survival, diverts health resources from other uses
and is a significant burden to the health care systems in developing
countries where 98% of all unsafe abortions occur (WHO 2011). At
the same, it is a preventable phenomenon depending on access to
safe abortion care or effective contraception. Therefore, there is
both an interest and a need to estimate the cost of PAC to inform
public discussion of unsafe abortion and to help policy makers more
efficiently allocate resources (Vlassoff et al. 2009b).
The report Adding it up: the costs and benefits of investing in
sexual and reproductive health (Singh et al. 2014) estimates the total
health-system cost of providing PAC services in the developing
world at US $232 million in 2014. Because many women need PAC
but cannot access it--and those who do get medical care may not re-
ceive comprehensive quality care--providing all women in need
with the WHO recommended standard of care would cost substan-
tially more, an estimated $562 million. Unsafe abortion is a burden
not only for health systems but also for women themselves and their
households. A study in Uganda, where abortion is common despite
being legally restricted and highly stigmatized, found that women
having unsafe abortions spent on average US $49 in out-of-pocket
expenditures for the procedure as well treatment of complications
(Sundaram et al. 2013). For many of these women, similar to much
of the developing world where unsafe abortion is prevalent, such ex-
penditures are onerous given the prevailing low levels of income.
Until recently, few studies on the cost of PAC were available and
they generally lacked a standard methodology, making their findings
difficult to generalize (Vlassoff et al. 2009b; Shearer et al. 2010). In
response to this knowledge gap, a coherent methodology has been
developed, pilot tested and further refined in four successive country
studies. This methodology, the Post-abortion Care Costing
Methodology (PACCM), will be described in more detail below. The
findings of the studies using PACCM provide the start of a consist-
ent evidence base, comparable across countries and regions. While
calculating the cost of unsafe abortion varies according to the frame
of reference chosen (Vlassoff et al. 2008), PACCM adopts the per-
spective of national health systems, focusing on the financial burden
that the treatment of post-abortion complications imposes on health
systems.
Over the last five years, comprehensive national surveys of the
cost of PAC to national health systems have been undertaken in
Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda and Colombia using the PACCM ap-
proach. (Vlassoff et al. 2012; Prada et al. 2013; Vlassoff et al.
2014a,b) This study extends the research findings of these four stud-
ies, making use of their extensive datasets to thoroughly exploit the
possibilities for comparative analysis. Our objective is to compare
empirical results of the health-system costs of treatment of complica-
tions resulting from unsafe induced abortion from these country ap-
plications of the PACCM methodology. These studies offer the most
complete and consistent estimates of the cost of PAC to date, and
comparison of their findings not only provides generalizable
implications for health policies and programs, but also allows an as-
sessment of the PACCM methodology.
Data sources and methods
PACCM follows the `ingredients approach' (Johns et al. 2003) and
traces its origin to the WHO's Mother-Baby Package costing spread-
sheet (Weissman et al. 1999). A prototype of the method was first
used in an abortion-incidence study in Nigeria (Bankole et al. 2007)
and subsequently the Guttmacher Institute developed PACCM, first
testing it out in pilot studies in Mexico, Ethiopia and Pakistan in
2008. PACCM, using a health-system perspective, was designed as a
low-cost method of estimating PAC costs that would be useful for
policy analysis. Data on drugs, supplies and materials, labor inputs
of medical personnel, hospitalization costs, overhead costs and cap-
ital costs are collected from key informants in a survey of health
facilities. Direct-cost data are gathered on each of the five broad cat-
egories of abortion complications--incomplete abortion, sepsis,
shock, cervical/vaginal laceration, and uterine laceration/perforation
(WHO 1999).4 A key feature of PACCM is its coverage of both dir-
ect and indirect costs--overhead and infrastructure costs that, while
not direct inputs into the provision of specific treatments, are never-
theless necessary for the provision of care in general. Indirect costs,
in particular, have rarely been estimated in earlier costing studies
(Vlassoff et al. 2009b). However, PACCM studies show that indir-
ect costs are an important component of total PAC costs. Other
work, not related to PAC costs, has also highlighted the importance
of indirect costs. For example, a United Nations report estimated
that in 2009 indirect (also referred to as non-medical) costs made up
two-thirds of total reproductive health costs in Sub-Saharan Africa
(United Nations, Economic and Social Council 2009).
Each of the four studies surveyed a sample of health facilities that
provide PAC, with a typical sample size of about 40 facilities, rela-
tively small but considered adequate to represent variation, and hav-
ing the advantage of keeping data-collection costs low. The design of
the sample of health facilities takes into account the three dimensions
of region, facility type and ownership. Within each region-type-own-
ership cell it is assumed that there will be little variation in the cost in-
puts such as drug dosages or salaries of personnel, making it
reasonable to select just a few facilities per cell. Major regions of the
country should be included in the design, to the extent that ethnic,
cultural or socio-economic differences could conceivably affect the
availability and quality of PAC. Usually three types of facility are
sampled representing major levels of health care, keeping in mind that
facilities with no capacity to provide PAC should not be included.
For each of the five post-abortion conditions, PACCM gathers
detailed data on labor, drugs, materials and supplies, which to-
gether make up the direct cost of PAC. The labor component con-
sists of the salary cost of the time spent treating the patient by all
health workers involved in the patient's care (over the full course
of a patient's stay). Labor from all medical personnel is accounted
for in PACCM, from gynecologists and anesthesiologists, to vari-
ous cadres of nurses, to lab technicians and pharmaceutical staff.
Typically, specific data on ten or more categories of worker are
collected. As medical staff's time is not entirely devoted to provid-
ing care, data are collected on the non-medical time spent by each
category of worker, for example in activities such as meetings,
training, idle time and paperwork. This information is used to ad-
just upward the contribution of labor to the total cost per PAC
treatment.
The second major component of direct cost in the PACCM is the
sum of all inputs of drugs, materials, supplies and lab tests given
Health Policy and Planning, 2016, Vol. 31, No. 8 1021
over the course of a particular treatment. The number of inputs is
quite large, typically in the range 100­150. For each input used in
the treatment of a specific post-abortion complication and inpatient/
outpatient status, we calculate an average cost by multiplying the
percent of patients receiving the input by the number of units given
over the course of treatment. Furthermore, these data are gathered
separately for inpatients and outpatients, as the quantity of inputs
given to patients may differ substantially by inpatient/outpatient sta-
tus. The unit prices of these physical inputs are not collected in the
PACCM survey itself. Prices of drugs and supplies are obtained both
from a country's state medical procurement and distribution organ-
ization and from several international sources. Other factors influ-
encing final cost, either positively or negatively, such as spoilage,
stock-outs, transportation costs and bulk-order discounts are not
measured. The prices of laboratory tests are obtained from a small
survey of private laboratories. The cost of blood, particularly im-
portant for some complications such as shock, is also obtained
through country-specific efforts.
In PACCM two kinds of indirect cost data are collected, covering
capital costs and overhead costs. Capital cost include the cost of
construction of facilities as well as the complete cost of equipping
the facilities with furniture, vehicles, specialized machines and
equipment such as X-ray machines and laboratory equipment. Key
informants are also asked to estimate the useful lifetime of the facili-
ties. These data, together with an assumed annual rate of inflation,
allow the annual cost of capital per facility to be calculated.
The overhead costs in PACCM comprise all operational and
other variable costs of health facilities that are not directly related to
medical care. Detailed data are gathered on the labor cost of all
non-medical staff, as well as annual expenditures for items such as
outsourced services, administration, maintenance, utilities, insur-
ance and other sundry costs. The number of data points in the
PACCM questionnaires devoted to overhead items is typically in the
order of 50­70 depending largely on the number of identifiable
cadres in the country's health system.
Two questionnaires, one for collection of data on drugs, supplies
and materials and one for all other inputs, gather information from
key informants such as senior health care providers and facility ad-
ministrators. Questionnaire A queries informants on labor costs,
overhead costs and capital costs associated with the provision of
PAC in their facilities. First, for each of the five abortion complica-
tions, the survey gathers data on the percent of cases, on average,
that are attended by each type of health worker and the average
number of minutes each worker spends treating or attending the
patient.
Questionnaire A also collects information on the monthly salary
for each cadre (including fringe benefits such as health insurance,
pensions, travel allowances, etc.), and the time health personnel
spend on non-treatment activities such as administrative duties and
idle time. In order to collect information on the indirect costs, the re-
spondents are also asked to provide estimates on the useful life of
the infrastructure and equipment, the cost of constructing new facili-
ties and a checklist of specific overhead expenses at their facilities.
Questionnaire A is also administered to key informants at the cen-
tral level (e.g. ministries of health or headquarters of faith-based or-
ganizations), as a means of cross-checking information gathered in
facilities.
Questionnaire B collects detailed information about the kinds
and quantities of drugs, supplies and materials used for each of the
five types of abortion complication. Respondents are requested to
estimate the percent of patients receiving each input used in treating
each condition, as well as the quantity of the drug typically
administered or the quantity of supplies/materials consumed. This
questionnaire also gathers information on laboratory tests per-
formed. Information about additional drugs or supplies not listed in
the questionnaire but still used at the facility to treat complications
is solicited as well.
Given the technical nature of the PACCM questionnaires, the field
personnel selected for conducting interviews need to have a fairly high
level of qualifications and/or experience. Recent graduates of master
programs in public health or even physicians preparing for internships
have been respondents for these four applications of PACCM.
Approximately one facility can be covered per day because of the
number of interviews and the amount of time needed to collect the
full set of data for a facility. Interviews with several health workers
and administrators are typically required to completely fill out the
two questionnaires and interviews with respondents are often split
into two or more sessions to avoid respondent fatigue and also be-
cause medical personnel need to respond to emergencies as they arise.
Although PACCM basically uses accounting type calculations,
the number of dimensions in the data leads to somewhat complex
formulae. Computing the cost of labor can be summarized by the
following three equations.

Results
Comparison of four studies that applied the PACCM
methodology
Although some details of the PACCM methodology changed from
study to study, the broad similarity among the four studies allows us
to compare their findings and to make wider generalizations. The
studies covered Ethiopia (2008),5 Uganda, (2010), Rwanda (2012)
and Colombia (2012). Table 1 lists some key indicators of the four
countries as well as characteristics of the four surveys carried out in
these countries. The three African countries are similar in terms of
income, their GDPs per capita falling within a narrow range (I$981­
I$1167).6 Colombia's income level is far higher (I$9121). Annual
expenditure on health follows the same pattern: Colombians spend
at least five times more than any of the three African countries. Also
noteworthy is the fact that health spending per capita in Rwanda is
three times greater than in Ethiopia. Furthermore, while Ethiopia
spends around 5% of its income on health, Uganda and Rwanda
spend around 10%.
In all four countries access to legal abortion is highly restricted.
However, in 2005 Ethiopia broadened the grounds for legal

abortion and in 2006 new procedural guidelines considerably
increased access to abortion de facto (Singh et al. 2010). Colombia
also widened access to abortion in 2006 as the result of a ruling by
the Constitutional Court of Colombia (Prada et al. 2011). As seen in
Table 1, Uganda has a very high abortion rate--one of the world's
highest--while Ethiopia and Rwanda exhibit more moderate abor-
tion rates. Colombia's abortion rate of 39 induced abortions per
1000 women in 2008 is higher than the Latin American regional
average of 32 (Sedgh et al. 2012). Around 23­29% of women
undergoing induced abortion were treated for post-abortion compli-
cations in Uganda, Rwanda and Colombia, but only 14% in
Ethiopia. This proportion depends on two factors: the proportion of
induced abortions that result in complications that need medical
care in a facility (which in turn depends on the number of abortions
carried out in unsafe conditions) and the proportion of women with
such complications who are able to access facility-based care. One
or both of these factors likely play a role in the low proportion
observed in Ethiopia.
The reported distributions of types of post-abortion complica-
tions (Table 1) show some variation among the four countries.
Incomplete abortion, the least severe of the five complications ana-
lyzed, makes up > 85% of all post-abortion complications in
Colombia, but only a little over 60% of them in Uganda.
Conversely, perforations of the uterus, the most serious complica-
tion, are almost absent in Colombia but comprise around 3% of all
complications in Uganda. In general, the severity burden is highest
in Uganda and lowest in Colombia. Ethiopia and Rwanda fall in be-
tween these two extremes.
The four studies are all based on survey data collected from PAC
providers and administrators at health facilities. In Rwanda and
Uganda the selection of facilities (39 facilities in each case) gave the
data collected a national coverage. In Colombia, 30 facilities were
selected from all five major regions of the country, but were limited
to the largest urban centers in each region. In Ethiopia, due to
budget restrictions, only 14 facilities were sampled, all of them ei-
ther in the capital city, Addis Ababa, or in neighboring districts. As
such, the findings of the Ethiopian study are not necessarily repre-
sentative of the whole country. Despite these differences among the
four studies, the commonality of the methodology allows us to ex-
plore variations in treatment inputs to gain a better understanding
of PAC cost drivers.
Labor inputs
The labor cost of health personnel who are directly involved in treat-
ing patients is a major component of PAC costs. The labor input is
made up of several components: the composition of the health
cadres, the composition of complications, the amount of time spent
with patients, the salaries and benefits paid to health personnel and
the proportions of their work time actually spent in treating pa-
tients. Table 2 shows some of these labor input components for five
groupings of health workers. (Personnel not directly involved in
medical treatment of patients are dealt with below as part of indirect
costs.) In the first panel of the table, the average amount of time
spent with patients during treatment at health facilities is compared
across the four countries for the five health cadres. These estimates
are weighted averages for the five types of complication. Two pat-
terns are evident: in Ethiopia and Colombia doctors spend about
30­60% more time with PAC patients than do nurses; in Uganda
and Rwanda however nurses spend 220­280% more time with pa-
tients than do doctors.7 These latter countries seem to be more suc-
cessful at task shifting, although a relative shortage of doctors may
also play a part. Also noteworthy is the greater involvement of tech-
nical personnel, mainly lab technicians, in Colombia (157 min) com-
pared to the three African countries (<40 min on average). As an
economically more developed country, one may speculate that more
diagnostic tests are routinely performed.
Salary structures (second panel of Table 2) show large differ-
ences among the four countries. For all cadres of health personnel,
almost without exception, Ugandan salaries are the lowest and
Colombian the highest, keeping in mind that they are shown here in
international dollars, which equalizes purchasing power across the
four countries. Compared to Uganda, Ethiopian health workers are
about 1.8 times more expensive, Rwandan workers twice as expen-
sive and Colombian workers almost six times more costly.
Another hard-to-measure component of labor cost is the adjust-
ment that needs to be made for non-treatment time spent by health
providers (third panel, Table 2). Overall, the four studies estimated
that 10% of work time is spent in non-treatment activities such as
paperwork, attending meetings and idle time. The proportion of
non-treatment time is lowest among doctors (2­6% in three coun-
tries although much higher in Uganda at 18%), likely because of the

higher cost of their time and greater interest in using that time effi-
ciently. Levels are also lower than average for the least qualified
cadre of health workers (5­7% among auxiliary nurses)--possibly
because this group has less involvement in meetings and lower
responsibilities for paperwork. However, since non-treatment time
is likely to be under-reported in studies without time-motion obser-
vation, this component of labor cost is almost certainly
underestimated.
The fourth panel of Table 2 combines all the above cost compo-
nents into estimates of labor costs per PAC case. These range from
lower levels in the three sub-Saharan countries (I$42.80­I$58.20) to
a much higher level in Colombia (I$301.30). Technical personnel
and counselors in Colombia are relatively costly components of
labor costs (being 3.3 times more than the four-country average),
while nurses are relatively less expensive (1.7 times the average
cost). Also noteworthy, doctors comprise 67% of the total labor
cost in Ethiopia but only 38% of it in Rwanda. Conversely, nurses
contribute 30% to direct labor costs in Ethiopia but 49% in
Rwanda. The contribution of technical cadres (such as lab techni-
cian, sonographer, etc.) to labor costs is striking: in Ethiopia it
amounts to only 2%, while in Colombia it accounts for 14% of
labor costs.
Drugs/supplies inputs
The second major component of direct costs is the set of physical in-
puts that are consumed in PAC treatments. These include drugs,
medical supplies and materials as well as laboratory tests and pro-
cedures such as sonograms. Costs per PAC case for these inputs for
the four countries, broken down by type of treatment, are shown in
the upper panel of Table 3. The average cost of drugs and supplies is
lowest in Colombia (I$79) and highest in Rwanda (I$115). In gen-
eral, cost differentials between countries are not large, compared to
differences in labor costs, and it is particularly notable that they are
lowest in Colombia, on a purchasing power parity basis.
Purely in terms of costs, Colombia does well in treatment of
cases of incomplete abortion, which comprise the large majority of
PAC cases, spending only I$41 per patient on drugs, supplies and
tests, compared to I$116 spent in Rwanda and I$100 in Ethiopia.
On the other hand, treating patients with shock in Colombia is more
than ten times more costly (I$645) compared to Ethiopia where only
I$62 is spent on physical inputs. However, from these data it is not
possible to tell how far these differences reflect efficiencies in treat-
ment--they may also indicate scarcity in availability of drugs, sup-
plies and lab tests in lower-income settings.8 Overall, PAC in
Colombia requires the least expensive bundle of physical inputs
(I$79) compared to an average expenditure of I$93 across the four
countries. Drilling down into the data on laboratory tests confirms
this finding. For example, in Colombia patients being treated for in-
complete abortion are given 0.3 hemoglobin tests and 0.3 white
blood cell tests on average, whereas in Rwanda and Uganda such pa-
tients are given between 1.0 and 1.4 tests.
Indirect costs
The four studies also collected data on indirect costs to the health
system of PAC. The data in Ethiopia, however, were later judged to
be deficient and were not reported on. Table 4 summarizes the re-
sults for three components of indirect costs: capital costs (the amor-
tized annual cost of infrastructure construction and capital
equipment), non-medical labor costs (the cost of personnel not dir-
ectly involved in medical treatment) and operational costs (the cost
of maintenance, utilities, etc.). In Colombia it was not possible to
separate the latter two overhead components, so the estimate of
I$517 includes both combined. This estimate is several times greater
than overhead costs in either Uganda (I$57) or Rwanda (I$97). On
the other hand, the estimate of the annual amortized cost of capital
is substantially higher in Uganda (I$213) than in Rwanda or
Colombia. It constitutes 52% of the total cost per case in Uganda,
compared to 16% in Rwanda and only 10% in Colombia.
Total cost per PAC case
Table 4 summarizes the six cost components identified in these stud-
ies and presents their estimates of the total cost per PAC case in
international dollar terms. At I$972, the cost of treating unsafe
abortion in the Colombian health system is by far the costliest. Keep
in mind, however, that indirect costs were not calculated in the
Ethiopian study. If indirect costs were taken to be the average per-
centage of total costs across the other three studies (61%), the total
cost per case in Ethiopia would amount to I$345, in between the
Uganda and Rwanda estimates. Using this estimate for Ethiopia, the
average cost per case across the three Sub-Saharan African countries
is I$362. Labor and overhead are the major cost drivers in
Colombia (together they constitute 81% of the total cost), but less
important in Uganda and Rwanda (22% and 46% respectively).
The costs of drugs/supplies and the cost of capital, on the other
hand, seem to be more important drivers of PAC costs in African
settings.
PAC is costly on a per capita basis as seen in the last panel of
Table 4. Treating a single PAC patient costs the equivalent of 11%
of the annual GDP per capita in Colombia and an astounding 35%
in Ethiopia and Uganda. Regardless of who pays and what subsidies
exist, fully one third of the average annual productive output on one
individual goes to offset the cost of to treating one PAC patient in
Ethiopia and Uganda. When we compare cost per PAC case to the
average annual expenditure in health, the financial burden of unsafe
abortion is put into even starker relief. Treatment for one episode of
post-abortion morbidity consumes more than three times the annual
per capita expenditure on health in Uganda and more than five times
in Ethiopia. Even in Colombia, expenditure on one PAC case
is > 100% the average annual per capita spending on health.

Cost of PAC vs. competing costs
In general, PAC costs are substantially higher than the cost of safe
abortion procedures. In countries where abortion is legal or admin-
istratively permitted such as Colombia or Ethiopia, the differences
in costs are worth noting: the average PAC cost per client in
Colombia is I$972 versus an average cost of a safe abortion9 of
I$313 (Prada et al. 2013); and in Ethiopia I$345 (PAC) versus I$190
(abortion procedure).10 A global study of all developing countries
estimated that the average cost per PAC case was more than twice
the average cost of safe abortion procedures . (Singh et al. 2014)
In many developing countries such a comparison cannot be
made because abortion is illegal for the most part. Pregnancies may
be terminated by induced abortion, but most unintended pregnan-
cies can be prevented from occurring by using an effective method
of family planning. In Table 4 (lower panel) we present estimated
total one-year costs of contraception for the four PACCM countries,
using data from the latest edition of the Adding It Up study. (Singh
et al. 2014) When these costs, which range from I$26 to I$29, are
compared to the PAC costs in Table 4, one sees a great advantage to
preventing unwanted pregnancies through family planning over
treating post-abortion complications, which costs health systems
from I$334 to I$972 in these four countries.
Finally, it is worth comparing the cost of PAC to the cost of ma-
ternal and newborn health (MNH) in general, since PAC is one com-
ponent of MNH. The national cost of MNH in Uganda (without
PAC costs included) was estimated in 2008 at US$345 million
(Vlassoff et al. 2009a), which, when extrapolated to 2012, becomes
around I$990 million. The annual national cost of PAC in Uganda
was found to be around I$42 million in 2012, a little over 4% of the
MNH total (Vlassoff et al. 2014a). On a per case basis, however, an
average MNH intervention in Uganda cost I$123 in 2012, while an
average PAC case cost I$394 to treat. A similar comparison can be
made for Ethiopia using estimates from Sundaram et al. (2010) and
Vlassoff et al. (2012). National PAC costs in Ethiopia in 2012 are
somewhat >3% of national MNH costs (annually I$54 million and
I$1.6 billion, respectively). On the other hand, per case costs were
estimated to be I$238 (PAC) compared to I$433 (MNH) in 2012.
Discussion
In the developing world abortion is still largely prohibited, except
for narrow legal indications and is still heavily stigmatized.
Research in this subject area is thus fraught with difficulties in gath-
ering reliable and complete data. Data on the cost of medical care to
treat abortions complications are likewise scarce. However, more
studies of the cost of PAC have recently become available, four of
which apply a standardized methodology and well-specified descrip-
tions of the cost components analyzed--two important factors that
will allow us to use these four studies to begin building a body of
comparable costing estimates.
While research into the cost of PAC is beginning to attract more
attention, important gaps still remain. The most thorough studies
available, national-level studies from Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda
and Colombia, estimated average costs per PAC case of I$345,
I$407, I$334 and I$972, respectively. A review of literature in 2007
estimated an overall average of I$414 per PAC case (Shearer et al.
2010). Our review of more recent literature from 2008 to 2013
(Table 5) found that the average cost per PAC case was I$347 for
seven studies that included both direct and indirect costs. Thus, a
body of consistent cost estimates is emerging. As for regional differ-
ences in PAC costs, a comparison of the four PACCM studies shows
the cost of PAC to be substantially higher in Colombia than in the
three African countries, but this may not be generally true of the
Latin American region since earlier regional estimates showed little
difference between African and Latin American average costs per
case: I$392 and I$430, respectively (Shearer et al. 2010). These vari-
ous estimates suggest that spending on PAC is an important finan-
cial burden. In the four PACCM countries, the cost of treating one
post-abortion patient is considerable: around 35% of annual per
capita income in Uganda, 29% in Rwanda and 11% in Colombia.
This burden is particularly acute in Uganda where facility-based
treatment for one PAC patient costs the equivalent of four month's
income for an average person.

The increasing use of medication (typically misoprostol) in treat-
ing incomplete abortion, the least severe and most common type of
complication, will probably lead to lower PAC costs in the future.
Studies citing costs of specific post-abortion treatments indicate that
using medication for treating incomplete abortion may be only one-
sixth as expensive as MVA (Foster-Rosales et al. 2003; Hu et al.
2010). A model-based study of abortion costs in Uganda found that
task shifting could also reduce PAC costs. For instance, the study
calculated that by instituting a suite of cost-saving measures, includ-
ing task shifting and use of lower-level facilities when appropriate
for the treatment of particular types of post-abortion complications,
costs would be reduced by around 45% (Johnston et al. 2007).
The wide variation in labor costs (both medical and non-medical
personnel) seen in the four PACCM studies also point to operational
efficiencies which could be made in PAC delivery by sharing experi-
ences across countries. This is particularly the case for Colombia,
where doctor salaries are as much as seven times the salaries of their
African counterparts, even after adjusting for purchasing power.
Task-shifting should be considered in Colombia as well as measures
to reduce the total amount of time that medical personnel spend on
the various treatments. On the other hand, the study showed little
variation in overall expenditure on physical inputs and hence offers
no lessons to be learned for this cost component. We found that
overhead costs in Colombia were far above those of the three
African countries. While it is beyond the scope of this study to
speculate on the causes of this large disparity, there does seem to be
scope for cost-cutting measures in the case of non-treatment expend-
itures in Colombia.
One important policy response to high levels of unsafe abortion
is to attack its root cause, unintended pregnancy, by promoting fam-
ily planning. Around 40% of all pregnancies in developing countries
are unintended and almost half of all these unintended pregnancies
are terminated by abortion (Sedgh et al. 2014). At the same time,
substantial rates of unmet need for contraception are reported in vir-
tually all developing countries (Sedgh and Hussain 2014). In the
three African PACCM countries, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Uganda,
the latest findings on unmet need are 26, 34 and 21% of all women
of reproductive ages (ICF International 2012). In Colombia, by con-
trast, where fertility decline has reached replacement level, unmet
need stands at 8%. Providing modern methods of contraception to
women with an unmet need for contraception would greatly reduce
unintended pregnancies (except for a small number of pregnancies
that would occur due to contraceptive method failure). The cost of
doing so is just a fraction of the cost of PAC: in Ethiopia one year of
modern contraceptive services and supplies is equal to 12% of the
average cost of treating a PAC patient, in Rwanda 9%, in Uganda
7% and in Colombia 3%.11 Preventing unintended pregnancies
would not only reduce health systems cost of PAC and the cost of
abortion procurement to women and households, but would also
bring great health benefits in the form of lower maternal morbidity
and mortality, better infant health and broader intergenerational im-
provement. In the four countries with PACCM studies, providing
contraceptive services for one year to a woman or couple cost only
about one tenth as much as the cost of treating one PAC patient. It
is our hope that the cost estimates provided in this article will stimu-
late policy discussion around these health issues.
In its latest report on unsafe abortion the World Health
Organization estimates that 13% of maternal deaths are caused by
unsafe abortion (WHO 2011). Policies that reduce unsafe abortion
therefore are also important in efforts to lower maternal mortality
and morbidity. One line of attack is to advocate for more liberal
abortion laws. Even with a more liberal legal framework in place
however, persistent value systems and the continued stigmatization
of induced abortion may result in large proportions of abortions tak-
ing place clandestinely and under unsafe conditions. In Bangladesh,
for example, even after more than three decades of national cover-
age by the government-supported menstrual regulation12 program,
about half of all pregnancy terminations are still via the procure-
ment of (illegal) induced abortion rather than through legal men-
strual regulation (Singh et al. 2012).
While the PACCM methodology is able to generate reasonably
precise costing estimates with an inexpensive data-collection budget,
the approach has some limitations. One drawback has already been
alluded to: The PACCM method itself has evolved from the pioneer-
ing Ethiopian study through to the most recent Colombian one,
with new refinements being added to each of its applications. For
example, the indirect costs module proved to be inadequately speci-
fied in Ethiopia, so the estimates of indirect costs were ultimately
discarded from the Ethiopian study. The evolution of the method
has meant that the ability to compare results across studies is some-
what restricted. Another limitation of PACCM is that for the most
part the data are based on expert opinion. Hence, results are less
precise than if an intensive (but costly) case-based approach were
used. A third limitation concerns the inherent difficulty in gathering
data on abortion. In each of the four countries, we were able to rely
on the results of existing studies of the incidence of induced abor-
tion. Even so, some uncertainty exists around questions such as the
percentage distribution of post-abortion complications, the propor-
tion of women with post-abortion complications that do not or can-
not access the health system and the split between induced and
spontaneous abortions.
The PACCM methodology has provided health policy analysts
with the first national-level comprehensive estimates of the cost of
PAC to health systems. It has been applied in a variety of contexts
and is a comparatively inexpensive tool for obtaining policy-relevant
information on the cost of PAC. Incremental improvements to the
methodology will continue to be made in future work, for instance
by addressing the problem of interviewer fatigue in filling out long,
tedious questionnaires. Replacing hard-copy questionnaires with
interactive input software using laptop computers would be a useful
improvement in this area. The consistency of results using PACCM
gives confidence that further applications of the methodology would
lead to an even more solid measurement and understanding of PAC
costs in developing countries.

Notes
1. We use the WHO definition of unsafe abortion: `a pro-
cedure for terminating an unintended pregnancy performed
by persons lacking the necessary skills, in an environment
that does not conform to minimal medical standards, or
both.' (WHO 2011) It follows from this definition that
most post-abortion complications are the result of unsafe
abortions.
2. See Say et al. (2014) and Kassenbaum (2013). Given the
difficulty in obtaining abortion-related data and the ten-
dency to under-report abortion-related deaths, the upper
estimate is probably the more accurate one.

include counseling and provision of family-planning and
reproductive health services.

6. An international dollar (I$) in a given country buys a
comparable amount of goods and services that a U.S. dol-
lar buys in the United States. Using I$achieves `purchasing
power parity' when comparing costs between countries.
The ratios of I$to US$in the four countries at the time of
the study were: 2.15 (Colombia), 3.84 (Ethiopia), 3.00
(Rwanda) and 2.87 (Uganda).
7. In the Rwandan health system there are no personnel des-
ignated as `auxiliary/assistant nurses'. There are, however,
four categories of nurses. The functions of the lower
grades may approximate those of auxiliary nurses in other
countries.
8. Some other direct costs were measured in the three
African studies but not in the Colombian one. These in-
clude the lodging and meals aspect of hospitalization and
fees charged for specific services. These costs amounted to
3­5% of per case PAC costs in the three African coun-
tries (Table 4).
9. In Colombia, almost all of the small number of safe
abortions recorded in official statistics use the D&C
procedure.
10. As part of the PACCM study in Ethiopia in 2008
(Vlassoff et al. 2012), data were collected on the cost of
one abortion procedure, manual vacuum aspiration, the
procedure that was generally used at that time for safe
abortions. Although the sample of facilities was not se-
lected randomly, nor was it nationally representative, de-
tailed information on the costs of inputs were collected
from 14 health facilities in both in-patient and out-patient
settings. For 2008, the direct cost of abortion procedures
(MVAs) was estimated at USD 26.50. In terms of interna-
tional dollars in 2012, the average cost of an abortion
procedure was I$109. The total cost per procedure (direct
and indirect costs) was estimated to be I$190.
11. For example, the total family planning bill to satisfy un-
met need for contraception in Rwanda would be around
I$21.6 million, while the total PAC bill would amount to
I$7.5 million. Another I$2.9 million would be saved by
averting abortion procedures. This, of course, is a very in-
complete cost comparison since so many other benefits, in
terms of health and finance, would accrue to lowering the
level of unmet need for contraception--for instance, all
the mother and newborn care costs saved by averting un-
intended childbirth. Data on cost of contraception are
taken from Singh et al. (2014).
12. Menstrual regulation (MR) has been part of Bangladesh's
national family planning program since 1979. MR is a
procedure that uses manual vacuum aspiration to safely
establish non-pregnancy after a missed period.
