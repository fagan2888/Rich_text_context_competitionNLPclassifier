The NHS is not just a whole set of separate organisations with
their own autonomous responsibilities . . . but a group bound by
values and principles which transcend that. Because of those
values and principles you have to take your people with you.

Introduction
The Institution of the NHS
In July 2012, London hosted the Olympic Games and televi-
sion viewers across the world tuned in to watch the opening
ceremony. Amid depictions of a selection of key moments in
British history and cultural life was a tribute to the National
Health Service (NHS). A newspaper headline later pro-
claimed, "Americans baffled by `left-wing tribute' to free
healthcare during Opening Ceremonies," with a Los Angeles
Time sports reporter, Diane Pucin commenting, "For the life
of me, though, I am still baffled by NHS tribute at opening
ceremonies. Like a tribute to United Health Care or some-
thing in US" (Press Association, 2012). Danny Boyle, direc-
tor of the ceremony, said, "He chose to feature it because
`everyone is aware of how important the NHS is to
everybody in this country'" (Stebner, 2012). The prominence
of the sequence in the ceremony alongside references to
important moments in the nation's social history certainly
suggests that the NHS is an institution sufficiently deeply
embedded within Britain to contribute significant meaning to
its society
The NHS is a relatively young institution that came into
being in 1948 and was for some time inextricably linked with
the restructuring and nation-building that characterized the
post-war period. In charting the history of the NHS, Baggott
(2004) points out its popularity among post-war generations
who have grown up with the welfare state. For those with no
pre-1948 experience, a health service that is free at the point
of delivery and paid for out of taxation still constitutes the
"natural" order of things, although the waves of crisis around
management, finance, and reorganization that have beset the

Changing the Ties That Bind? The
Emerging Roles and Identities of General
Practitioners and Managers in the New
Clinical Commissioning Groups in the
English NHS

Abstract
The English National Health Service (NHS) is undergoing significant reorganization following the 2012 Health and Social
Care Act. Key to these changes is the shift of responsibility for commissioning services from Primary Care Trusts (PCTs)
to general practitioners (GPs) working together in Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). This article is based on an
empirical study that examined the development of emerging CCGs in eight case studies across England between September
2011 and June 2012. The findings are based on interviews with GPs and managers, observations of meetings, and reading of
related documents. Scott's notion that institutions are constituted by three pillars--the regulative, normative, and cognitive­
cultural--is explored here. This approach helps to understand the changing roles and identities of doctors and managers
implicated by the present reforms. This article notes the far reaching changes in the regulative pillar and questions how these
changes will affect the normative and cultural­cognitive pillars.

NHS from the 1970s onward together with scandals concern-
ing patient care have shaken employee and public confidence
in aspects of the institution. Nevertheless, as Appleby (2012)
points out, recent surveys of public satisfaction with the
NHS fluctuate but remain fairly high. Moreover, public sup-
port for the principle that it is "the government's responsibil-
ity to provide health care for the sick" is undiminished, while
backing for government support for the unemployed has
fallen (Park, Bryson, Clery, Curtice, & Phillips, 2013, Table
2.1).
It is not surprising, then, that Danny Boyle should choose
the NHS as a symbol of "Britishness" and that outsiders
(Americans) would find attachment to this institution baf-
fling. The suggestion of a "left wing tribute" also highlights
the idea that the NHS is emblematic of the welfare state
where health care is provided to all irrespective of wealth or
status. Recent work focusing on developments within the
NHS (Checkland, Harrison, Snow, McDermott, & Coleman,
2012; Macfarlane, Exworthy, Wilmott, & Greenhalgh, 2011)
has suggested that Scott's analytic approach to institutions
(Scott, 2008; Scott & Christensen, 1995) is particularly per-
tinent. Located within the tradition of sociological institu-
tionalism, Scott argues that institutions can be understood in
terms of three constitutive elements or pillars: the regulative,
normative, and cognitive­cultural pillars. Institutions are
shaped by sets of rules and regulations (the regulative pillar)
enforced by sanctions and sometimes coercion. Scott argues
that the regulative aspects of institutions are those of which
we may be most conscious. The normative pillar of institu-
tions refers to the norms and values held by individuals and
the behavior that ensues from their efforts to uphold these
values. Institutions, Scott (2008) asserts, ". . . are widely
viewed as having moral roots" (p. 56), which shape the con-
duct and behavior of individuals. The cognitive­cultural pil-
lar of institutions refers to the taken-for-granted and
unremarked aspects of institutional life. These are the char-
acteristics that an outsider may remark on but which the
"native" intuits (as explicated by Geertz, 1973). We attach
meaning to how various institutions work; Scott &
Christensen (1995) use the term "cultural template" (p. xviii)
and assert we will understand what constitutes a commercial
corporation, a school, or a hospital. The cultural template we
have for each will be different and we can see how the mean-
ings we attach to these kinds of institutions will be deter-
mined by context and history.
Macfarlane et al. (2011) and Checkland, Harrison, et al.
(2012) explain how Scott's institutional theory might help in
understanding the NHS. The NHS is made up of many differ-
ent organizations including hospitals, public health, dental
services, GP surgeries, and so on. These organizations over-
lap and are staffed by individuals with a range of profes-
sional interests, for example, managers, nurses, and doctors.
However, these writers argue that despite organizational and
professional differences, the NHS as a whole has a particular
ethos and set of values with which the workforce can and
does identify. So the managers interviewed by Macfarlane et
al. strongly identified with the "socialist origins and egalitar-
ian, no-frills values" of the NHS (Macfarlane et al., 2011, p.
919), while the doctors and managers in Checkland et al.'s
studies saw themselves as being part of an "NHS family."
Furthermore, there are a range of embedded cognitive­cul-
tural assumptions that NHS "insiders" take for granted, such
as an assumption that those working in the NHS, regardless
of their employing organization, are members of a shared
common enterprise (Checkland, Harrison, et al., 2012).
One of the key concerns of Scott's institutionalism is the
idea of stability and continuity: Something is said to have
become "institutionalised" when it has become self-perpetu-
ating (Scott, 2008, p. 22). This is not to say that institutions
cannot change, and understanding when and how such
change will occur is one of the key empirical puzzles for
institutional scholars. The NHS is clearly a different institu-
tion today from the one created in 1948 (Klein, 2010). Scott's
institutional theory can help us to think about how that
change might have occurred and become embedded over
time. Sustained change requires that the three pillars remain
aligned, with regulative changes backed up by complemen-
tary evolution in both norms and cognitive­cultural mental
scripts (Scott, 2008). Indeed, Caronna (2004) persuasively
argues that regulatory changes unmatched by changes to
norms or cognitive scripts generated dysfunctional change in
the American health system. The past two decades alone
have witnessed profound changes affecting the English NHS.
For many commentators, the NHS and Community Care Act
of 1990 was a watershed regulatory change, as it marked the
beginning of the purchaser­provider split and quasi-market.
With these reforms came challenges to medical professional
control and autonomy, increasing self-regulation and surveil-
lance, and the entry of private providers into the NHS mar-
ketplace (Harrison & Dowswell, 2002; McDonald, 2009;
McDonald, Harrison, & Checkland, 2008). Commentators
have noted that competition, regulation, and the quasi-mar-
ket are stronger features of the English NHS in comparison
with those of Wales and Scotland, whose governance is
devolved from British central government (Greer, 2008).
Harrison (2009) focuses on the introduction of self-regu-
lation and commodification of health care through mecha-
nisms such as the Quality Outcomes Framework (an incentive
scheme for GPs with financial rewards going to practices
accomplishing tasks on a menu of patient care indicators).
He shows that these regulations challenge normative views
concerning the professional roles of doctors, but suggests
that this "commodification" can, in time, become "natu-
ralised" as the normal way doctors think about their practice.
Thus, it seems that the profound regulatory changes experi-
enced by the NHS in the past have been accompanied by
some shifts in the cognitive­cultural taken-for-granted
understandings among institutional members.
In the next section, we explore the possibilities of such
shifts through an examination of the process of doctors
Segar et al. 3
becoming managers, a process that is certainly not new but
has recently become more pronounced.
Changing Roles and Identities: Doctors Becoming
Managers
One of the shifts in institutional cognitive­cultural assump-
tions identified by Harrison (2009) was the way in which
managerial ways of thinking became normalized among
members of the medical profession. This normalization has
both fed and been fed by the significant increase in formal
managerial roles for both doctors and nurses within the NHS,
initially mainly in hospitals but more recently also in primary
care (Bolton, 2005; Sheaff et al., 2003; Thorne, 2002).
Indeed, although Harrison (1988) noted that some clinicians,
including GPs, have been involved in NHS management
since 1974, present reforms set the scene for GPs to be
involved in management in unprecedented numbers.
The subject of "doctors as managers" has received a great
deal of attention and is particularly relevant here because it
touches on both the normative elements of what it means to
be a professional clinician and the deeper cognitive­cultural
assumptions, which underpin identity. What are the responsi-
bilities and duties of a doctor and of a manager and what
happens when these roles are combined? A recurrent theme
in this literature is the way in which doctors who take on
managerial roles are confronted with questions about their
identity and in so doing often choose to reassert the primacy
of their identities as clinicians. This was nicely illustrated by
Lord Darzi, a London surgeon, who was asked by the then
Labor government to undertake a "review" of the NHS in
2008. This was, in essence, a managerial task, but the final
report (Department of Health, 2008) is illustrated by a photo-
graph of Lord Darzi wearing operating theater clothes. He
chose to present himself as primarily a clinician, although he
was acting in a managerial capacity.
In this context, we take "roles" to be the formal and infor-
mal expectations held by individuals and their colleagues
about the duties and responsibilities associated with holding
particular positions (Katz & Kahn, 1978). "Identities" are
"the individual's own notion of who and what they are"
(Watson, 2008, p. 131), shaped by their experiences and by
the social situation in which they find themselves. Forbes,
Hallier, and Kelly (2004) and Forbes and Hallier (2006) sug-
gest that doctors in hospitals who take on managerial roles
undergo a recategorization of the social self. They regard
themselves as doctors first, primarily responsible to their
patients, and some engage in "organisational misbehaviour,"
which obstructs the work of senior managers. Both Mo
(2008) and Llewellyn (2001) report that management work
is regarded as something that takes doctors away from their
clinical work where their prime loyalties and allegiances lie.
They also make the point, as does Doolin (2001), that man-
agement work has lesser status than clinical work and that
those doctors taking on managerial roles adversely affect
their reputation in the eyes of their peers. Working in these
"hybrid" roles entails a blurring of boundaries and hence
gives rise to anxieties about identity. Similarly, nurses in
managerial roles are keen to prioritize their clinical qualifica-
tions over new leadership titles (Martin & Learmonth, 2012),
and to make the point that they are nurses first and managers
second (Bolton, 2005). McDermott, Checkland, Harrison,
Snow, and Coleman (2013) make a similar observation in
respect of GPs who took on managerial roles under the
scheme known as Practice Based Commissioning (PBC).
PBC was a voluntary scheme that enabled groups of GP
practices known as consortia to become involved in the com-
missioning of services. While participating GPs were enthu-
siastic about the scheme itself, GPs who took on managerial
roles as GP commissioners identified themselves as GPs
rather than as managers and displayed low levels of certainty
about their roles as managers. It could be argued that these
uncertainties and tensions have an origin, at least in part, in
some deep-seated and only partially conscious cognitive­
cultural assumptions about what a GP "is" and what they
"do."
Thus, clinicians taking on managerial roles continue to
claim that their prime allegiance remains to the ideal of
patient care. Similarly, research among managers working in
the NHS suggests that they too have a strong commitment to
patient care and to public service (Currie & Brown, 2003;
Merali, 2005). Hewison (2002) highlights NHS middle man-
agers' concern for patient welfare and points out that they
share a similar "commitment to the values and ethos of the
NHS" (p. 564) as their clinical counterparts, contesting the
stereotype of the gray suited manager concerned solely with
the "bottom line"
Since the 1980s, managers in the NHS have borne the
brunt of politically inspired, top­down reorganization and
change. This has been referred to by McMurray (2010) as a
"pandemic of organisational reforms" (p. 56), which he sug-
gests results in "response fatigue" among affected managers.
Nevertheless, Greener's (2008) study concluded that while
NHS managers'work is constantly changing, they keep sight
of their long-term goal to serve the best interests of the pub-
lic. Likewise, Macfarlane et al. (2011) found that senior NHS
managers held fast to their ideals of an NHS culture rooted in
a belief of public service.
It has been suggested that a public service ethos is charac-
terized by traits such as working for the good of the commu-
nity, loyalty to one's institution, and accountability to the
public (Pratchett & Wingfield, 1996). This implies that ideas
about public service are deeply connected to people's sense
of identity, incorporating both a normative understanding
about roles and duties and a deeper cognitive­cultural con-
ception of what it means to be a public servant. McDonough
(2006) attempts to unravel these understandings using
Bourdieu's notion of habitus to explain Toronto-based
municipal workers' fierce attachment to a sense of public
service even when experiencing restructuring, cutbacks, and
4 SAGE Open
privatization of services. She argues that their "public ser-
vice habitus" usually remains subconscious but is forced into
consciousness when confronted with the idea that the private
sector may be more efficient. She suggests that the idea of
what constitutes the public good will be increasingly con-
tested and potentially shifted by the continued restructuring,
resulting in a "destabilised habitus" for affected workers.
Scott (2008) considers the way in which institutions
change, and of interest here, discusses how they may weaken
and disappear. He points out that scholarly analysis often
highlights one aspect--regulative or normative or cognitive­
cultural change--as precipitating deinstitutionali-zation but
argues that these elements usually interact with one another.
For the NHS, it can be argued that successive regulative
change has clearly shifted the roles and duties of personnel
and may, as noted above, also begin to shift norms and val-
ues. Doctors and nurses who take on managerial roles are
described as becoming "hybrids" while health care profes-
sionals who implement guidelines and algorithms are seen as
having been gradually "co-opted" by management (Harrison,
2009; Numerato, Salvatore, & Fattore, 2012). Managers with
long careers in the NHS have witnessed periods of empower-
ment and legitimation followed by a "delayering" of middle
management and a clawing back of power (Currie & Brown,
2003; Macfarlane et al., 2011). Thus, roles and associated
normative understandings have changed (Greener, 2008;
Harrison & Dowswell, 2002). However, it would seem that,
through these changes, both clinicians and managers have
held fast to a cognitive­cultural sense of identity anchored in
a notion of public service and patient welfare.
Currently, the English NHS is adjusting to a major reorga-
nization. As we show in the next section, workers in all parts
of the service are taking on new roles and responsibilities as
new structures are put in place and new organizations cre-
ated. In terms of Scott's three institutional pillars, it is clear
that the regulative pillar of the NHS institution has under-
gone profound change. We argue that these changes call into
question the normative and cultural scripts held by GPs who
must now understand themselves as commissioners (that is
contracting with other organizations to provide services) as
well as providers of services. Being a commissioner is a
challenge to the normative sense of the GP role understood
as focused on patient care. To a lesser extent, managers' nor-
mative scripts of public service are also being queried, for
example, as some are moves to support units destined to sep-
arate from the NHS. As McDonough (2006) points out, these
levels of change force into consciousness questions about
identity, obliging individuals to think about their changing
roles and what these mean, and potentially challenging the
deeply rooted cognitive­cultural assumptions about the way
in which "things are done" in the NHS. The rest of this article
briefly outlines some of these recent changes and then reports
on a research study that focused on one aspect of the changes:
the introduction of Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs).
Findings from the qualitative part of this study are presented
to show the implications of some of these changes for the
roles and identities of GPs and managers.
Reorganization--The New Clinical
Commissioning Groups
In July 2010, plans for a significant reorganization of the
NHS were outlined in the White Paper--"Equity and
Excellence: Liberating the NHS" (Department of Health,
2010). Among other changes, responsibility for commission-
ing care for defined geographical populations was to be
passed to groups of GPs working together in CCGs. Thus, in
addition to their status as independent contractors to the
NHS, some individual GPs are now used by the CCG to
carry out management duties. The White Paper envisaged
that this would make GPs more accountable to the patients
they serve, and that it would provide them with an incentive
to act in ways that cut costs. At the same time, the previous
(managerially dominated) purchasing organizations, Primary
Care Trusts (PCTs), would be abolished and a new body,
NHS England (initially called the NHS Commissioning
Board), established, with responsibility for overseeing the
work of CCGs, allocating budgets, and undertaking some
aspects of commissioning themselves (e.g., specialist ser-
vices). It was argued that GPs' proximity to the frontline of
patient care put them in the best position to understand the
needs of their patients, making them responsive
commissioners:
In order to shift decision-making as close as possible to
individual patients, the Department will devolve power and
responsibility for commissioning services to local consortia of
GP practices. This change will build on the pivotal and trusted
role that primary care professionals already play in coordinating
patient care . . .. (Department of Health, 2010, p. 27)
While GPs take on increasing commissioning roles and
responsibilities, the White Paper declared that management
costs were simultaneously to be cut by 45% and that £20 bil-
lion of efficiency savings would be realized by 2014. As
Asthana (2011) points out, in this narrative, managers are
unambiguously equated with unnecessary bureaucracy and
cost. GPs, however, add value to the commissioning process
by bringing their "skills, knowledge and standing in local
communities" (NHS Commissioning Board, 2012b).
Each practice compulsorily became a member of a CCG,
with mechanisms in place to elect peers onto the governing
body. These representatives are overwhelmingly GPs,
although some have also elected practice nurses or practice
managers. In addition, each CCG is required to have a nurse
member, a consultant, and two lay members. The configura-
tion and organization of CCGs differ from site to site, with
no overall template set from the center. Most have some kind
of formal members' body, consisting of representatives from
each member practice, and many have also set up
Segar et al. 5
geographically based locality groups to involve a wider
range of local GP members. The choices that they have made
so far often derive from their own recent history (Miller et
al., 2012) and the particularities of the local context
(Checkland, Coleman, et al., 2012).
During the transition period, managerial support for
CCGs came from PCT staff, some of whom transferred to the
new structures as PCTs disbanded. However, CCG manage-
rial budgets have been set at a much lower level than was the
case for PCTs, and the new bodies are expected to "buy in"
significant parts of their managerial support from newly
formed organizations called Commissioning Support Units
(CSUs). These have been set up by former PCT staff and
often cover a large geographical area. While, initially, CSU
staff will be formally employed by NHS England, it is the
stated intention that these organizations will become "auton-
omous organisations in 2016 and will be fully established,
self-sustaining entities in a competitive market" (NHS
England, 2014). Overall, this represents a significant con-
traction in managerial numbers meaning redundancies and
job losses, and will also mean that managerial staff who are
transferred from former PCTs to CSUs could be working for
non-NHS employers after 2016. At the time of writing, there
are 211 CCGs in England (NHS Commissioning Board,
2012a) and 17 CSUs (NHS England, 2014).
Method
This article derives from a project examining the early work-
ings of emerging CCGs (Checkland, Coleman, et al., 2012).
The aim of the project was to capture the experiences of
"Pathfinder" CCGs (i.e., aspirant and emerging CCGs during
their period of early formation) during a period of intense
change. The overall research questions for the project
explored their experiences during this process. In this article,
we focus on the experiences of GPs and managers as they
came to terms with their new responsibilities, answering the
following broad research question: "How are GP and manag-
ers adapting to their new responsibilities, and what issues are
arising?"
Eight case study sites in England were purposively sam-
pled, to include a range of population sizes, organizational
structures, socio-demographic variation, relationships with
provider organizations, and configuration in relation to local
authority boundaries. Groups had signed up to become
Pathfinder CCGs in five different temporal "waves," and our
sample included CCGs from Waves 1, 2, 3, and 5. Both urban
and rural sites were included. This sampling strategy enabled
the capture of the full range of complexity in developing
CCGs.
Fieldwork was carried out in these sites from September
2011 to May/June 2012 and included interviews with a range
of NHS managers (47), GPs (33), and others (11) associated
with the CCGs (e.g., lay members) and the observation of a
range of meetings including CCG governing body meetings,
operational meetings, locality meetings, general members'
meetings, and meetings with a variety of external bodies
such as Health and Wellbeing Boards (forums bringing
together commissioners of health, public health, and social
care). Contemporaneous field notes were made and subse-
quently written up. Documents associated with these meet-
ings and with the governance and organization of their
groups were collected and read. In total, 146 meetings were
observed (approx. 439 hr) and 96 interviews undertaken;
these were recorded (with consent) and transcribed. Ethics
approval for this study was granted by the Greater Manchester
West Ethics Committee Research Ethics Committee 11/
NW/0375.
During the field research, we undertook to preserve the
anonymity of our participants. This has been a strong and
guiding principle throughout the research as we wanted to
ensure that all involved could speak freely. Care has been
taken that the anonymity of research participants has also
been maintained in the presentation of this article.
All of these data were analyzed with the help of Atlas tiTM
software. Data collection and analysis for each case within
the study have been undertaken in parallel, allowing the
research team to modify and develop topic guides as appro-
priate, following up significant findings and seeking contra-
dictory or confirmatory examples. Field notes taken during
meetings were coded alongside interview transcripts and rel-
evant documents, and initially emerging coding definitions,
analytical themes, and theoretical ideas were discussed and
refined at regular face-to-face team meetings and Skype con-
ferences. Nineteen such meetings/conferences were held
between September 2011 and May 2012. Transcripts and
field notes were read repeatedly for familiarization and
coded according to an initial framework based on our
research questions, our reading of relevant literature, and our
understanding of the policy context. Furthermore, "second
level" coding was undertaken to capture any unexpected
themes, which emerged from the data, and the analysis con-
tinually refined in written memos and team discussions.
Emerging analytical ideas were tested among the research
team members and refined. Coded data were then further
read and analyzed by a number of team members to ensure
consistency of approach. Initial thematic coding was refined,
revisited, and revised over the course of the fieldwork. Thus,
the data have been read and reread several times and unex-
pected second-order themes included in the analysis. For
example, "doing things differently" emerged as a recurring
theme, as those involved sought to establish their credentials
as "new" organizations, untainted by the perceived failures
of their predecessor commissioning organizations.
Two web-based surveys and a telephone survey were car-
ried out as part of the broader project; however, this article is
based solely on the qualitative data collected, focusing on
evidence about possible changes in what participants take for
granted about their roles and identities in the NHS institu-
tion. For full details of the broader project, see Checkland,
6 SAGE Open
Coleman, et al. (2012). Analysis of the data resulted in four
broad themes relating to the roles of GPs and managers:
shifting roles and identities, time pressures and other diffi-
culties experienced, what it means to be a "good commis-
sioner" in the new system, and the uncertainties facing
managers.
GPs With a Foot in Two Worlds: Shifting Roles
and New Identities
Clinicians who take on managerial roles are described as
being "bridges," "two way windows," "Janus-faced"
(Witman, Smid, Meurs, & Willems, 2011) or "wearing two
hats" (Checkland, Snow, McDermott, Harrison, & Coleman,
2011). As mentioned above, they often feel that their clinical
identity is threatened or compromised by managerial involve-
ment but that clinical identity is paramount. GPs taking on
positions in the new CCGs often had some previous experi-
ence of commissioning work such as GP Fundholding1 in the
1990s or PBC (see above) in the 2000s (Miller et al., 2012).
Miller et al.'s review highlights that many of the GPs who
became involved in Fundholding were entrepreneurial by
nature and were innovative leaders. The enthusiasm of these
individuals was not necessarily shared with rank and file
GPs. Membership of CCGs, unlike predecessor primary care
commissioning arrangements, is mandatory for all GP prac-
tices. GPs with formal roles will, in future, be involved in
decision making about commissioning/decommissioning of
services and will have statutory responsibility for these deci-
sions in terms of finances and care. Their commissioning
responsibilities will be wider than under previous schemes as
will be their power to spend budgets. They will also negoti-
ate with secondary service providers, Local Authorities, and
other external bodies such as Health and Wellbeing Boards.
It will also fall to these GPs to communicate the work of the
CCG to its members and to oversee the clinical behavior of
members through performance management of practices
relating to CCG budgets. It should also be remembered that
GPs who sit on CCGs will also remain working GPs with
caseloads of patients in their own practices.
Among the GPs that we interviewed, some articulated
tensions between their identities as clinicians and as manag-
ers. As the literature cited above demonstrates, this is not
necessarily new. As in previous GP commissioning arrange-
ments, the enthusiasts have taken on roles in the new CCG
governing bodies. The key difference now is that all GPs,
irrespective of inclination or enthusiasm, are through their
practices, members of CCGs. Many enthusiasts commented
that they enjoyed their new roles on CCG governing bodies
but that this work differentiated them from fellow GPs:
. . .you have to understand that the vast majority of GPs are not
in the least bit interested in all this, they just want to do their day
job, get on, look after their patients; they don't want to spend
their time reading documents and papers and commissioning
and all the rest of it. (GP and CCG chair ID 33)
Elections onto governing body positions showed the con-
tinuing tension between the clinician and manager role, with
many of the leadership positions being taken on by previous
office bearers and evidence of reluctance among the general
membership to take on these roles. Some sites struggled to
recruit new leaders and one site had a GP vacancy on their
governing board throughout our fieldwork period. On being
asked about election as locality chair and member of the
CCG governing body, this GP responded,
I've been very clinical in my career and I've got lots of clinical
special interests. And I've got lots of ideas and energy and
enthusiasm to develop those, and this is putting some barriers in
the way of that, in terms of time and also conflict of interest. So
it's opened some doors and closed others. And I still don't know
how I feel about that. (GP, locality lead and CCG board member

Some CCGs were unable to hold elections for office bear-
ers because of lack of nominations for positions and several
GPs explained that they had obtained their positions by
"default."
In common with some clinician managers in hospitals, GP
interviewees voiced misgivings about taking on managerial
roles (Thorne, 2002). They were concerned, on a practical
level, about not having the skills for these roles and not prop-
erly understanding the governance structures of CCGs. On a
deeper level, they did not view themselves as really being
"proper" managers:
I think they're expecting a lot from people that don't have those
skills and experience to do it and in all honesty I didn't go into .
. . medicine to be a manager and a commissioner. I mean I quite
enjoy it I think it's quite interesting in a way . . . but you only
know what you've picked up, it's not something you're trained
to do. (GP, CCG locality board member ID 229)
Anxiety about their role as both commissioners and
decommissioners of services is evident in the meeting extract
below. Being on the "frontline" of patient care means that
GPs will be responsible for commissioning decisions, includ-
ing decisions that may be unpopular with patients. Here,
locality board members need to limit an exercise referral
program:
[Name] started her introduction by saying that there would be a
lot of opposition to what was being proposed . . . to relook at the
current gym where GPs could refer patients to if they required
exercise programmes. Problem was that once a patient was
referred there was no end date so many people were long term
attenders. An additional issue was the location of the gym--
many people could not access the facility geographically so it
was not an equitable service and was currently not cost effective
. . . We spend eight times as much on this service as other
localities and have an insufficient service.
Proposal is to have a 16 week time limit on the service. For GPs
to design a new pathway. We can't decommission the
Segar et al. 7
service--this is unrealistic but we need to put a hold on new
referrals for 3 months . . . Patients will be unhappy as they like
the service. (CCG Locality executive meeting notes M35,
emphasis added)
This extract seems to suggest that those present share
some cognitive­cultural assumptions--it is said to be "unre-
alistic" to decommission a service, and this statement is not
challenged.
Time Pressures
Those GPs who have accepted new roles in the CCG now
face significant pressures on their time. They are usually
freed from their clinical duties for two to four sessions a
week and their practices are paid for locum cover. However,
these are not necessarily straightforward substitutions of
time and effort. As respondents pointed out, CCG work
entails attending and participating in formal meetings, work-
shops, and training sessions both internal to the CCG and
external (e.g., Health and Wellbeing Boards). Associated
with these meetings is a significant volume of documents
and emails. These commitments have implications for time
spent with patients, in the practice and personal time. As
illustrated below, there is no direct equivalence of the time
spent on CCG work with the time missed from GP practice
work. Time spent with patients, with practice colleagues, and
on home life has significance over and above the minutes
and hours involved. This resonates with Jones and Green's
(2006) findings on the significance of work/life balance and
flexible ways of working for the professional identities of
contemporary GPs.
I think the roles . . . I mean if I look back to where we were . . .
you know, in practice-based commissioning from where we are
now and the role is just unrecognisable the amount of work that
comes through, is huge. And to be honest, it is limitless. So I
very much see it as I have to prioritise and I have to do what I
can, accept that I cannot go to every meeting, and I cannot be
available for everything, and there are some things that at the
moment are going to get more attention and for the others maybe
less of a priority for the CCG. (GP and CCG clinical lead ID 36)
The ideal of GPs who are close to their patients and thus
responsive commissioners--as set out in the government's
2010 White Paper--may potentially place a heavy burden on
the shoulders of a few GPs. This GP sets out her strong con-
viction that being a "good commissioner" also requires her to
continue to shoulder a reasonable load of clinical work. She
reflects negatively on "certain colleagues" whom she feels
have already relinquished their "GP identity."
I always believed that to be a good clinical commissioner I need
to be a good clinician, so I have to study being a GP . . . and I
have to deliver a sensible number of sessions so that people still
know that I'm a GP and I'm delivering what GPs do. Certain of
my colleagues I've already seen doing less and less and less . . .
and their ability to continue in meetings already is . . . you know,
you could say: "well, what do you think about this? [clinical
service]" And they're like: "I've never used that." (GP and CCG
chair ID 231)
In her view, the commissioning role requires the mainte-
nance of a strong GP clinical identity, but the evidence pre-
sented above suggests that this is both practically difficult to
achieve as well as carrying with it inherent tensions and
conflicts.
In addition, our respondents were aware that their involve-
ment at CCG level had an impact on their practice
colleagues:
I think my biggest fear about all of the commissioning and the
changes that are going on with the reforms, is about the fact
that I'm not sure there is capacity . . . you're taking out, you
know, experienced GPs out of practice and . . . as a consequence
either there's backfill with less experienced people, with
locums, with less continuity of care . . .. (GP and CCG board
member ID 36)
Many also pointed out that a great deal of CCG work had
to be done in personal time, in the evenings or at weekends.
It is unlikely that this will be sustainable over any length of
time, raising issues for the future of GP-led commissioning,
especially if those involved are to continue to carry out sig-
nificant clinical duties. If they relinquish those duties, our
respondent quoted above would suggest that they will lose
credibility as commissioners.
Being a Good Commissioner and Being
Accountable
The idea that GPs are on the "frontline" of care and are there-
fore responsive to patient need and requirements is one that
resonated with our GP interviewees. They agreed that their
proximity to patients placed them in a good position to com-
mission services intelligently. There was, however, a grow-
ing awareness among some that they will shortly be directly
accountable to patients for commissioning decisions (Lind,
2012). With the handover of budgetary responsibility in the
context of the target of £20 billion of saving in health care, it
is likely that GP commissioners may have to make unpopular
decisions about spending and decommissioning services.
The responsibility for such decisions will no longer be attrib-
utable to PCTs, but to CCGs of which all GPs, via practices,
are now members.
GPs are probably the right people to do this, because the beauty
of the fact that we have to sit across the table from the individual
patient. And yes, we're not the most patient responsive bunch of
people, but we still have to meet Mrs Jones, and she still gets to
rant at us about the fact that her hip operation isn't being done.
And it will be our ears that get bent if we get it wrong. Whereas
that's not the case if you ask anybody else to commission. (GP
and CCG locality board member ID 221)
8 SAGE Open
What does worry me is the very difficult financial situation
we're in. Huge quick savings that we have been tasked with, and
the potential difficult rationing decisions we're going to have to
make and how that's going to sit with the public in the future and
the newspapers and that sort of thing. (GP and CCG board
member ID 103)
By contrast, both GPs and managers voiced more opti-
mism and excitement about increasing opportunities to take
part in contract negotiations with secondary care providers.
Best thing I've done, I suppose, in terms of the service redesigns
I've . . . discussing clinician to clinician with secondary care
colleagues, you . . . agree what makes obvious sense from a
patient pathway point of view, and then . . . the managers find a
way of making that work. (GP and CCG board member ID 67)
As McDonald (2009) points out, GPs enjoy high status
relative to the broader community, but this is not the case
within the narrow context of medicine. It may be that enter-
ing into contract negotiations in this way might mark an
increase in status for GPs.
Managers Facing Uncertainty and Insecurity
Many of our respondents, both clinicians and managers, jok-
ingly enumerated how many NHS reorganizations they had
experienced. Managers in particular have borne the brunt of
many of these (Light & Connor, 2011; Macfarlane et al.,
2011). They have also been portrayed by politicians and the
media as a bloated sector whose numbers need to be cut
(Merali, 2005). NHS managers have been characterized as
being resilient and resourceful in the face of these changes
(Checkland et al., 2011; Greener, 2008), and many of our
informants were optimistic and enthusiastic about the current
reforms, highlighting the value that GPs' clinical expertise
adds to the commissioning process. However, they were con-
cerned about GPs taking on managerial roles and the con-
comitant shift in their own roles. Some articulated this as both
GPs and managers having to undergo a "culture change":
It's really the cultural challenge I think, for GPs to understand
what it's like to be commissioners. The statutory responsibilities
you have, you know, there are things that you must do, should
do, and them understanding, I think, some of the legal
frameworks and constraints. And then for managers I think the
challenge has been around the shift of culture, becoming more
clinically orientated . . . and for some managers that's quite a
challenge because they have little clinical awareness. (Manager
ID 9)
At a more pragmatic level, there was concern about GP
capacity to take on commissioning and managerial
functions:
. . . they don't always understand the pathways, which is
surprising--you realise how little some of them know about
hospital-based care. As a manager, sometimes you think hmm,
maybe, physiologically I may not understand it, but I understand
the system and pathways and I understand what the cardiologist
does. (Manager ID 9)
There was also a feeling among managers that GPs are
first and foremost clinicians and that clinical work is some-
thing they can always "fall back on." For managers, though,
there is no fall-back position.
Running parallel with these concerns are worries about
changing employment structures and associated job losses.
As PCTs neared the end of their existence, managers were
being assigned to work in CCGs, in Public Health in the
Local Authority or in the newly formed CSUs. In addition,
some faced redundancy and job loss and many were under-
going processes of having to apply formally for their posts in
the changed structures. For those joining one of the CSUs in
England, there is the prospect that these organizations will
potentially no longer be part of the NHS after 2016. This
manager explained how some PCT colleagues had been
assigned to the CCG while others had been assigned to a
CSU:
So they're quite happy [those assigned to the CCG], I think,
really. The rest of the people in the PCT probably aren't quite as
happy because it's this, are you going to be a commissioning
support organisation, and I think the connotations around that
are that eventually . . . the NHS Commissioning Board [now
NHS England] say that they'll host it till 2016 and then
potentially they'll be privatised, or could be, and I think for
individuals that presents a challenge to them in terms of their
employment status, job security, etcetera . . . Because people
want to remain in the NHS. (Manager ID 287)
Assignment to a CSU means that managers may lose their
connections with their immediate local community. This has
implications for both managers and CCGs, with the latter
voicing concern about losing local knowledge.
On a personal level, job losses and job insecurity place a
heavy burden on individual managers, including those who
have to manage these changes.
In spite of upheaval and uncertainty, many managers--
particularly those in senior positions--still voiced enthusi-
asm about the possibilities of future partnership working
with GPs. Evident too were high levels of commitment to the
ethos of public service and to patient care.
I think, some of the clinical engagement that's come out of it:
massive buzz for me, because, if you get people with fire in their
belly and they get going, oh, it's fantastic . . . at the end of the
day, and, you know, I drive people mad about this, but, we come
to work, because, there's patients that need help. They need
healthcare and it's incumbent on us to make, you know, best use
of the tax payer's pound. (Manager ID 117)
This suggests that the new opportunities offered to some
managers in the new system had in fact strengthened their
Segar et al. 9
sense of themselves as public servants, working more closely
with clinicians to provide high quality health care.
Discussion
This research was undertaken during a period of intense and
major change. These changes and their implications are still
unfolding and it is too soon to talk definitively about their
results and outcomes. Notwithstanding, it may be possible to
discern the "direction of travel" brought about by the current
reforms. Periods of fundamental change can force into con-
sciousness notions of identity and relationship to work and
peers that are normally taken for granted: the cognitive­cul-
tural mental scripts referred to by Scott (2008). This research
has captured some of the issues surrounding role and identity
change currently being faced by NHS GPs and managers.
Our findings resonate with previous literature in showing
that both GPs and managers (perhaps with different empha-
ses) view patient care as their raison d'être and have a strong
public service ethos. These are the ties that bind them to the
institution of the NHS. As Scott points out, we cannot pre-
sume that institutions simply persist and that the beliefs and
practices associated with them just endure. He argues that
changes in the three constitutive pillars of institutions inter-
act with one another and that there may be times when the
pillars are "misaligned" and may "support and motivate dif-
fering choices and behaviors" (Scott, 2008, p. 62). It is at
such moments that institutional change occurs. What our
data suggest at this point of the reforms is that radical change
taking place in one of the organizational pillars may not nec-
essarily be followed by changes in the other two pillars, thus
leading to institutional dysfunctionality.
In Scott's terms, the current reforms constitute an obvious
instance of regulative change. Two hundred-eleven CCGs in
England now have full responsibility for spending £60 bil-
lion of public money. It could be argued that these changes
have much in common with previous attempts to reform the
NHS. We would contend that the current reforms go much
further than their antecedents. In contrast to the predecessor
commissioning organizational forms of GP Fundholding and
PBC, CCGs have wider commissioning responsibilities; and
unlike the earlier schemes of Total Purchasing and PBC,
CCGs control and spend real money (Miller et al., 2012). A
further marked contrast with earlier GP commissioning
experiments is that CCGs are membership organizations
where membership is not voluntary but compulsory. GPs are
formally in control of CCGs with no buffer organization
replacing PCTs or their various predecessors.
The responsibility for commissioning spending, including
taking unpopular or difficult decisions in the context of
squeezed resources, will also now fall to CCG leaders. In
Scott's terms, this means an inconsistency or instability in
the normative organizational pillar. The norms and values
that GPs uphold in their roles as "frontline" clinicians are
different from their roles as CCG leaders, managers, and
budget holders.At its simplest level, GPs in their clinical role
view the needs of the individual patient in front of them as
paramount. Our data suggest that GPs in managerial posi-
tions in CCGs must marry this with a population-level con-
cern with budgets, priorities, and possible service cuts. GPs
in our study showed themselves to be acutely aware of this
tension. At best, some argued that their very closeness to
patients would ensure that they made good decisions as com-
missioners; others expressed a concern that the need to
engage with burgeoning budgetary pressures would under-
mine their relationship with their patients and, by extension,
their sense of identity as clinicians. These role and identity
tensions faced by GPs taking on managerial roles are not
completely new, but we argue that they are greater than under
previous GP commissioning models. These roles have the
potential to change their relationships with peers as they will
now take responsibility for their performance management
in light of devolved budgets and the need to attain savings
targets. The use of the term frontline to describe the position
of GPs is significant. It has been used as shorthand to refer to
GPs' proximity to their patients and to the concerns of their
patients. It is clear that GPs identify with the notion that they
are patient facing; it is less clear that they fully embrace the
norms associated with their new roles as managers and com-
missioners. They certainly do not take it for granted that all
GPs by virtue of CCG membership have a stake and respon-
sibility for commissioning.
The issue of the time and resource commitments required
for GPs to take on roles in CCGs is not a trivial one. At the
individual level, it also calls to question normative under-
standings about the role of GPs. It also reaches into general
practices drawing on the expensive time of experienced GPs.
So while "rank and file" GPs may not understand CCG
membership as changing the nature of their clinical role, the
absence of practice members is felt. The need to cover these
absences might be seen as disrupting the cognitive­cultural
assumption underpinning general practices as small busi-
nesses. In relation to secondary care, GPs will have increased
opportunities to play a major role in contract negotiations
also potentially shifting elements of the cognitive­cultural
understandings of what it means to be a GP.
The data presented above already point to a distinct
uneasiness concerning the roles of GPs as CCG board mem-
bers who are responsible both for commissioning and decom-
missioning of services. It also points to a reluctance of many
GPs to take on formal commissioning roles. It remains to be
seen whether these shifting roles will become normalized,
that is, constitute change in Scott's cognitive­cultural pillar;
will GPs and those they serve come to understand that they
are commissioners and that this is part of their professional
identity? Either way, we would argue that such far reaching
change obliges those involved not only to consider their
changing roles but also what these changing roles mean in
terms of identity. Such shifts in the cognitive­cultural pillar
of institutions take time to discern, and the data we have pre-
sented do not yet present a clear story of cognitive­cultural
change. Indeed, while some GP respondents highlight their
10 SAGE Open
desire to cling on to a strong clinical identity, and argue that
this is essential if they are to fulfill their new role, others
voice their discomfort at the tensions they experience, with
some managers suggesting that GPs will "need to change."
Overall, this suggests that the significant regulative changes
that we have seen are in the process of destabilizing long-
held cognitive­cultural assumptions about "who we are" and
"what we do." It is not possible at present to suggest what the
eventual outcome will be, but it seems likely that there will
be at least some shift in the nature of the institution that is the
English NHS.
The managers supporting CCGs are also in the midst of
another round of ebb and flow of their power and authority.
Many of the managers that we observed and interviewed
were in the process of moving into different organizations set
on different pathways. Some were being made redundant and
others had chosen to leave ahead of the changes meaning the
loss of talented and experienced people to the NHS. Many of
our respondents pointed out that managerial teams are being
fragmented with concomitant loss of organizational memory
and of connection to local communities. For others, their
leadership roles have changed as GPs are set to lead the new
CCGs. There has clearly been a regulative shift seeking to
subordinate managers to doctors; whether this change will
spread to the other pillars, thus recreating "diplomatic man-
agement" as described by Harrison (1988), will be interest-
ing to watch. A key question to follow will be whether these
changes affect managers' identity as public servants who are
part of the NHS family.
The question that our data raise is whether the current
changes may go further than creating shifting roles for some
GP and managers. Might these changes erode what Scott
refers to as the cognitive­cultural pillar so that some GPs and
managers begin to relate to the NHS in different ways? Many
of the issues that our interviewees raised were reflections on
changing identity, alongside their changing roles. The previ-
ously stated rationale for bringing GPs into commissioning
was their proximity to frontline patient care, their standing in
the community, and their understanding of local health care
needs. Our findings suggest that engagement in managerial
work may potentially take GPs away from patient care, may
alienate them from their peers, and may, in time, make them
unpopular with patients. GPs who have undertaken roles in
their CCGs could opt to retreat to their "day jobs" leaving
commissioning in the hands of the few. Early evidence
appears to support this contention, indicating that GP repre-
sentation on CCG governing bodies is falling away (Kaffash
& Mooney, 2014). It seems likely that those who stay on will
see themselves and be seen by others as being different from
"ordinary rank and file GPs." These GPs will be taking on
new identities as "GP commissioners," and it is not yet clear
whether they will be able to maintain the same relationships
with their patients and with their colleagues.
The changes that we observed as CCGs are becoming
established are still unfolding, and the questions posed here
will require further time to be answered definitively. In par-
ticular, can a good commissioner be a good GP? How will
budgetary accountability affect relationships between GP
leaders, their patients, and their colleagues? Will managers
be able to retain their public service ethos if they no longer
work in their local community or no longer work directly for
the NHS? Will, as this initial research suggests, these changes
serve to change the ties that bind them to the NHS?
