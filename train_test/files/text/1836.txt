Serum Anion Gap and Blood Pressure in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Eric N. Taylor, John P. Forman, Wildon R. Farwell
Abstract--Increased production of organic acid can result in an elevated serum anion gap and may play a role in the
development of hypertension. We studied the cross-sectional associations between anion gap and blood pressure and
between serum bicarbonate and blood pressure in the 1999-2000 and 2001-2002 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys. We included 5043 adult participants who were not taking antihypertensive medications or
diuretics and who denied hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other diseases. Linear regression was used
to adjust for age, race, body mass index, creatinine, albumin, and other factors. Sample weights were used to produce
weighted regression parameters. In the lowest quintile of anion gap, mean values of sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate
were 139 mEq/L, 105 mEq/L, and 25 mEq/L, respectively. In the highest quintile, mean values of sodium, chloride, and
bicarbonate were 140 mEq/L, 101 mEq/L, and 22 mEq/L, respectively. Mean blood pressure was 118/72 mm Hg. After
multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest quintile of anion gap had systolic blood pressure 3.73 mm Hg
higher (95% CI: 1.83 to 5.63 mm Hg; P for trend: 0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile. Participants in the
highest quintile of bicarbonate had systolic blood pressure 2.73 mm Hg lower (95% CI: 1.26 to 4.20 mm Hg; P for trend:
0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile. No associations were observed between anion gap or bicarbonate and
diastolic blood pressure. The results were unchanged after excluding participants with estimated glomerular filtration
rate 60 cc/min per 1.73 m2. The anion gap is independently associated with higher blood pressure. Further research
is needed to elucidate the relation between organic acid and hypertension. (Hypertension. 2007;50:320-324.)

Hypertension affects 65 million individuals in the
United States1,2 and is an important independent risk
factor for cardiovascular disease3­6 and renal failure.7­9 The
pathogenesis of hypertension is poorly understood and re-
mains under active investigation. It has been suggested that
increased production of organic acid may lead to the devel-
opment of hypertension.10
Metabolic acidosis, increased renal acid excretion, and in-
creased metabolic production of acid have been reported in rat
models of hypertension and in salt-sensitive humans. For exam-
ple, plasma pH and bicarbonate were lower in spontaneously
hypertensive rats than in normotensive controls.11,12 Metabolic
acidosis preceded the development of hypertension in the hy-
pertensive rats, suggesting that the acid-base changes were not
the product of elevated blood pressure or associated renal
insufficiency.12 Metabolic studies of rats on both high- and
low-salt diets have demonstrated increased urinary acid excre-
tion in salt-sensitive compared with salt-resistant rats.13 Of note,
the higher levels of acid excretion in the salt-sensitive rats
appeared to be because of increased metabolic production of acid.13
Analogous results have been reported in salt-sensitive humans.14,15
The results of a recent study analyzing the 24-hour excre-
tion of urinary citrate in 3000 men and women are
consistent with the hypothesis that higher levels of organic
acid production may be related to high blood pressure. The
excretion of urinary citrate is regulated most prominently by
acid-base status, with acidosis resulting in a marked reduction
in citrate excretion.16 After adjustment for age, body mass
index (BMI), diet, and other urinary factors, participants with
hypocitraturia were 2.5 times more likely to have prevalent
hypertension than those without hypocitraturia.17
To date, there have been no population-based studies of
acid-base status and blood pressure. An increase in unmea-
sured anions, as seen in many causes of metabolic acidosis,
results in an elevated serum anion gap. We examined the
associations between serum anion gap and blood pressure and
between serum bicarbonate and blood pressure in the 1999­
2000 and 2001­2002 National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Surveys (NHANES).

nhanes/nhanes01-02.htm).18,19 Briefly, NHANES provides nation-
ally representative cross-sectional data on the health status of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. After selection in a
complex survey design, participants were interviewed and examined.
Participants over the age of 12 years without hemophilia or recent
cancer chemotherapy were eligible for measurement of a biochem-
istry profile that included serum chemistries and creatinine. In the
interview, participants were asked about their medical history, including
the presence or absence of health professional­diagnosed hypertension,
kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, coronary
heart disease, angina, myocardial infarction, stroke, cancer, and other
diseases. Participants were also queried about the use of specific
medications, including antihypertensive medications and diuretics. Par-
ticipants were defined as current smokers if they reported that they were
currently smoking and had smoked 100 cigarettes in their entire life.
A dietary interview collected data for estimating the daily intake of
dietary factors, including total protein and potassium, on the basis of
foods and beverages that participants consumed during the 24-hour
period preceding the interview (midnight to midnight).
Measurement of Serum Electrolytes
and Creatinine
Serum electrolytes, albumin, and creatinine were measured with a
Hitachi Model 704 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim
Diagnostics). We calculated anion gap according to the following
equation:
Anion gapserum sodium (mEq/L)
[serum chloride (mEq/L)serum bicarbonate (mEq/L)]
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated according to the
simplified Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study prediction
equation.20 Specifically, estimated GFR186.3(serum creatinine in
mg/dL)1.154age0.203 0.742 if female)(1.21 if black). We corrected
serum creatinine in the NHANES 1999­2000 sample to align creatinine
values with the creatinine assay used in the development of the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study equation.21,22 Serum creati-
nine in the NHANES 2001­2002 sample did not require correction.
Measurement of Blood Pressure
Blood pressure was determined by mercury sphygmomanometer
according to American Heart Association guidelines.23 Three or 4
blood pressure determinations (systolic and diastolic) were taken on
all of the eligible individuals. The arithmetic mean of blood pressure
recordings was used as the blood pressure.
Statistical Analyses
Because older individuals, Mexican Americans, and black individu-
als were intentionally overrepresented, NHANES 1999­2000 and
2001­2002 were not simple random samples of the US population.
Therefore, appropriate sample weights were used to obtain weighted
regression estimates, and the final results of our analyses are
generalizable to the US population.
For our analyses, we excluded participants with self-reported
chronic diseases, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease,
diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease,
myocardial infarction, angina, cerebrovascular disease, and cancer
(except nonmelanoma skin cancer), as well as those taking antihy-
pertensive medications or diuretics. We divided the serum anion gap
into quintiles. Within each quintile of anion gap, we calculated the
percentage of each categorical demographic characteristic and the
mean value (SE) of age, BMI, each laboratory measurement, and
blood pressure. Race-ethnicity was predefined in NHANES 1999­
2000 and 2001­2002 as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, or other. In linear regression analyses, systolic
and diastolic blood pressures were examined as dependent variables,
with quintiles of serum anion gap (or continuous anion gap) as the
independent variables. Covariates considered were age; gender;
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
other); BMI (continuous); smoking (current, past, or never); serum
levels of creatinine, albumin, calcium, and potassium (continuous);
and daily intakes of total protein and potassium (continuous). We
calculated 95% CIs for parameter estimates of both systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. Tests of trend were calculated across
quintiles of anion gap with the median value of each quintile serving
as an ordinal variable. All Ps were 2 sided. We also used logistic
regression to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CIs of abnormal
blood pressure (defined by the seventh report of the Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure as systolic blood pressure 120, diastolic
blood pressure 80, or both1) by quintile of anion gap. We
performed similar analyses with bicarbonate, rather than anion gap,
as the independent variable.
Data analysis was performed with SAS 9.1 and SUDAAN 9.0.
Protocols to recruit and study participants of NHANES 1999­2000
and NHANES 2001­2002 were reviewed and approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.
Results
A total of 9832 participants aged 18 years had complete
measurements of serum electrolytes and creatinine and de-
nied the use of antihypertensive medications or diuretics.
After excluding individuals with self-reported hypertension,
chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart fail-
ure, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina,
cerebrovascular disease, and cancer (except nonmelanoma skin
cancer) and individuals with measured albumin 3.5 g/dL
and/or measured calcium 10.5 mmol/L, there were 5043
participants remaining in the study population. Characteristics of
these participants are shown in Table 1. Because the relations
among anion gap, serum bicarbonate, and blood pressure did not
vary by sex, results for men and women were combined.
Serum anion gap was positively associated with systolic
blood pressure in age-adjusted and multivariable-adjusted
analyses (Table 2). After adjusting for age, gender, race,
BMI, creatinine, and albumin, systolic blood pressure in-
creased by 0.48 mm Hg (95% CI: 0.28 to 0.69 mm Hg) for
each milliequivalent-per-liter increase in serum anion gap.
After multivariable adjustment, participants in the highest
quintile of anion gap had systolic blood pressure 3.73 mm Hg
higher (95% CI: 1.83 to 5.63 mm Hg; P for trend: 0.01) than
participants in the lowest quintile. The relation between anion
gap and diastolic blood pressure was not statistically significant.
The multivariable-adjusted OR of abnormal blood pressure
(systolic blood pressure 120, diastolic blood pressure 80, or
both)1 was 1.68 (95% CI: 1.18 to 2.41; P for trend: 0.01) for
participants in the highest quintile of serum anion gap compared
with those in the lowest quintile.
We also evaluated the relation between serum bicarbonate
and blood pressure. To determine the association between
bicarbonate and blood pressure independent of serum sodium
and chloride concentrations, we included serum sodium and
chloride in the multivariable models. After adjusting for age,
gender, race, BMI, creatinine, albumin, sodium, and chloride,
systolic blood pressure increased by 0.46 mm Hg (95% CI:
0.23 to 0.69 mm Hg) for each milliequivalent-per-liter de-
crease in bicarbonate. After multivariable adjustment, partic-
ipants in the highest quintile of bicarbonate (mean: 26.8
mEq/L) had systolic blood pressure 2.73 mm Hg lower (95%
CI: 1.26 to 4.20 mm Hg; P for trend: 0.01) than participants
in the lowest quintile of bicarbonate (mean: 20.2 mEq/L). The
Taylor et al Anion Gap and Blood Pressure 321
relation between bicarbonate and diastolic blood pressure was
not statistically significant.
Finally, we performed analyses excluding the 126 partici-
pants with chronic kidney disease (defined by calculated GFR
60 cc/min per 1.73 m2) from our sample (Table 3). The
results were similar to the primary analysis. After adjusting
for age, gender, race, BMI, creatinine, and albumin, partici-
pants in the highest quintile of anion gap had systolic blood
pressure 3.70 mm Hg higher (95% CI: 1.75 to 5.66 mm Hg;
P for trend: 0.01) than participants in the lowest quintile.
Further adjustment for smoking, serum calcium, serum po-
tassium, and dietary intake of total protein and potassium did
not materially change the results.
Discussion
In adult participants of NHANES 1999­2002, higher levels
of serum anion gap were associated with higher blood
pressure. This relation was independent of age, gender, race,
BMI, and levels of serum creatinine and albumin. Because
our study excluded participants who reported cardiovascular
disease, hypertension, kidney disease, diabetes, or other
diseases and excluded participants taking antihypertensive
medications or diuretics, it is unlikely that illness or medica-
tion use confounded the observed relation between serum
anion gap and blood pressure. Of note, the mean values of
serum electrolytes and blood pressure in our study were in
ranges considered normal.
The cause of the observed association between higher anion
gap and higher blood pressure is unknown. Elevations in the
serum anion gap can result from an increase in unmeasured
anions, as in several causes of metabolic acidosis, or from a
decrease in unmeasured cations.24 In general, reductions in
serum calcium and potassium concentrations are unusual causes

of an elevated anion gap,24 and in our study the relation between
anion gap and blood pressure was unchanged after adjustment
for these cations. Serum albumin can also affect the anion gap,25
but we excluded individuals with low serum albumin, and we
adjusted for albumin in the multivariate analyses. A mild
elevation in anion gap has been reported in metabolic alkalosis,26
but we are unaware of data linking metabolic alkalosis to higher
blood pressure, and in our study higher serum bicarbonate was
not associated with higher blood pressure.
It is possible that the participants in our study with higher
anion gap had a circulating unmeasured anion that contrib-
uted to higher blood pressure. The inverse relation between
serum bicarbonate and blood pressure suggests that such an
anion, if present, may be the conjugate base of an organic
acid. Of interest, metabolic acidosis, increased renal acid
excretion, and increased metabolic production of acid have been
reported in rat models of hypertension. For example, lower
plasma pH and bicarbonate have been reported in spontaneously
hypertensive rats and Milan hypertensive rats compared with
Wistar Kyoto and Milan normotensive control rats.11,12 Meta-
bolic acidosis preceded the development of hypertension in
young spontaneously hypertensive rats, suggesting that the
acid-base changes were not the product of elevated blood
pressure or associated renal insufficiency.12 Metabolic studies of
Dahl/Rapp salt-sensitive and salt-resistant control rats on both
high- and low-salt diets have demonstrated increased urinary
acid excretion in salt-sensitive compared with salt-resistant
control rats.13 Of note, the higher levels of acid excretion in the
Dahl/Rapp salt-sensitive rats appeared to be because of in-
creased metabolic production of acid.13
Human data suggesting a possible link between organic acid
production and high blood pressure are sparse but provocative.
In a metabolic study of 40 healthy normotensive young men
consuming controlled diets, there was an inverse association
between increases in blood pressure induced by a high-sodium
diet and both arterial pH and serum bicarbonate (of note, levels
of arterial pH and bicarbonate were in ranges considered normal
in both salt-sensitive and salt-resistant participants).15 The inves-
tigators then administered an ammonium chloride load to a
subset of these study participants, who again consumed con-
trolled high- and low-sodium diets.14 There was no difference in
renal net acid excretion between the salt-sensitive and salt-resis-
tant groups, suggesting that the relative metabolic acidosis in
salt-sensitive individuals was a result of increased production of
acid rather than a defect in renal acid excretion.
More recent data are also consistent with the hypothesis
that increased metabolic production of acid results in higher
blood pressure. The excretion of urinary citrate is regulated
most prominently by acid-base status (acidosis results in a
marked reduction in urinary citrate),16 and hypertensive
individuals excrete less urinary citrate than normotensive
control subjects.17 In 3000 participants in the Nurses'
Health Study I, the Nurses' Health Study II, and the Health
Professionals Follow-up Study, the multivariable ORs of
prevalent hypertension for those in the highest quartile of
24-hour urinary citrate excretion compared with the lowest
quartile were 0.37 (95% CI: 0.24 to 0.55; P for trend:
0.001) in Nurses' Health Study I, 0.54 (95% CI: 0.32 to
0.92; P for trend: 0.03) in Nurses' Health Study II, and 0.27
(95% CI: 0.16 to 0.45; P for trend: 0.001) in Health Profes-
sionals Follow-up Study.17 These results were adjusted for age,
weight, the intake of animal protein and potassium, and urinary
factors including calcium, citrate, oxalate, uric acid, sodium,
magnesium, potassium, phosphorus, creatinine, pH, and total
volume. Finally, we suggest, in a broad and purely speculative
fashion, that the higher blood pressures observed after adminis-
tration of sodium chloride versus sodium bicarbonate or sodium
citrate27­30 may represent a protective effect of alkali on sodium-
mediated increases in blood pressure.
Our study has limitations. Because the data are cross-
sectional, we cannot conclude that an elevated serum anion
gap is a risk factor for the development of higher blood
pressure. Instead, it is possible that higher blood pressure
results in an elevated anion gap because of an unknown
mechanism. An important limitation to any study of serum
electrolytes and blood pressure is that reduced kidney func-
tion is associated with higher anion gap, lower levels of
serum bicarbonate, and elevated blood pressure. Previous
NHANES data demonstrated that serum anion gap started to
increase and serum bicarbonate levels started to decrease
when estimated glomerular filtration was 20 cc/min.31
However, in our study we excluded participants with self-
reported chronic kidney disease, and we adjusted our analyses
for serum creatinine. In addition, we performed analyses exclud-

ing participants with chronic kidney disease, as defined by a
calculated GFR 60 cc/min per 1.73 m2.32 Another limitation is
that medications, such as diuretics, can affect both serum
bicarbonate levels and blood pressure. However, we excluded
participants who reported the use of such medications. An
additional limitation is that study participants were not eating
controlled diets. Net endogenous acid production is affected by
diet,33 and dietary factors play an important role in blood
pressure.34 However, the primary dietary determinants of net
endogenous acid production are total protein and potassium,35
and adjustment for the intake of these factors did not change our
results. Finally, we did not have measurements of arterial pH or
partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and we did not have urinary
parameters to measure renal net acid excretion. Thus, we are
unable to fully assess the acid-base status of the participants in
the study.
Perspectives
Higher serum anion gap is independently associated with
higher blood pressure. Prospective studies of the relation
between serum anion gap and incident hypertension are
needed. Our data provide support for the hypothesis that in-
creased production of organic acid plays a role in hypertension
and should encourage further research into the relation between
acid-base metabolism and blood pressure.
