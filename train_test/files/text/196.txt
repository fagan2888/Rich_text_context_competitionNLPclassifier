Gender and race differences in the correlation
between body mass and education in the 1971-1975
NHANES I

Abstract
Study objective-Differences in the cor-
relation between body mass index and
education across four gender and race
groups were investigated while simultane-
ously accounting for occupation, income,
marital status, and age.
Design-The study used analysis of
covariance techniques to calculate average
body mass and confidence intervals within
education categories while simultaneously
adjusting for the covariates: age, square of
age, family income, marital status, and
occupation.
Setting-Data were drawn from the US
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES I), 1971-1975. NHANES I
is a national probability sample designed to
gather information on the non-institution-
alised US civilians, ages 1-74 years.
Subjects-Samples of 8211 white women,
1673 black women, 6188 white men, and 1023
black men were drawn from the NHANES I,
1971-1975.
Main results-Data in the female samples
indicate a strictly inverse relation between
body mass and years of schooling among
white women and an inverted "U"
association among black women, achieving
a maximum around 8 to 11 years of school-
ing. In the male samples data indicate
inverted "U" relations among both black
and white men, reaching maxima between
12 and 15 years ofschooling. The sides ofthe
"U" curve are much steeper for black than
for white men.
Conclusions-The four gender/race cate-
gories display four different body mass
index and education associations. These
four associations are only slightly altered by
simultaneously adjusting for two additional
measures of socioeconomic status: occupa-
tion and income.
Obesity has been strongly linked to heart disease,'
many forms ofcancer,2 and arthritis, especially of
the knees.3 Thus further research into the causes
and/or correlates of obesity is warranted. This
study investigates the correlation between educa-
tion, one of the components of socioeconomic
status, and obesity in a national sample of adult
women and men. Prior research indicates that
socioeconomic status measured in a variety of
ways is strongly and inversely correlated with
being overweight among women.4-10 The results
among men have been less consistent. Some
studies find a negative relationship,4 while others
find a weak positive association,5 and still others
find a curvilinear relationship.6 A recent review
of published reports confirms the inverse
relationship for women and the great variety of
findings for men.8 However, these previous
studies (1) do not usually account for additional
suspected correlates ofbody mass such as marital
status and square ofage, (2) do not rely on a model
which accounts for the separate influences of
occupation, income, and education, and (3) do not
allow for curvilinear relations between schooling
and body mass.
An important criticism of prior research on
socioeconomic correlates of obesity is that the
studies have not carefully distinguished between
social science variables. Occupation, income, and
education are either grouped together to form a
socioeconomic status index or treated separately
in univariate analyses. Neither approach is fully
satisfactory. Occupation, income, and education
are best viewed as separate variables for two
reasons. First, theyhave different implications for
government and business intervention.1' 12 For
example, some businesses might sponsor exercise
or health promotion campaigns at work. Income
can be adjusted through businesses raising wages
or government altering taxation, welfare, and
social security spending. Education may be
affected by government spending on schools,
Headstart, and special training programs such as
the Job Corps. An economic analysis in a widely
cited text by Feldstein'3 suggests that ifincreased
education improves health, then national spend-
ing on education may be more cost-effective than
spending on medical care to reduce national
mortalityand morbidity. Second, there are widely
accepted theories explaining relationships among
occupation, income, and education. A proper
understanding of the role of schooling, for
example, must take into account that for most
people, educational achievement precedes career
choice and subsequent income. Thus many social
science models assume that high educational
achievement results in high earnings and employ-
ment in "good" jobs rather than vice versa."

SAMPLE
Data were drawn from the medical examination
component of the first US National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, 1971-1975
(NHANES I), conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics. NHANES I was a multi-
stage stratified probability sample of clusters of
persons in land based segments and is represen-

tative of the civilian non-institutionalised
population then residing in 48 states.'4
Since our interest was among adults, persons
under 21 were excluded from the analyses. The
subsample consisted of 8211 white women, 1673
black women, 1023 black men, and 6188 white
men. Persons of other races were excluded due to
small sample sizes.
VARIABLES
The dependent variable was body mass index
calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m)
squared (= weight/height2). Independent vari-
ables included years of schooling completed, age,
age squared, married spouse present, separated,
divorced, widowed, never married, family
income, work/activity status including binary
variables for retired, student, disabled, home-
maker and/or unemployed, and employment vari-
ables for professional, manager, sales worker,
craftworker, operative, labourer, farmer, and ser-
vice worker. Income was entered in categories in
the NHANES I. The income variable we used
represented midpoint values within each
category. Thus, for example, income between
$2000 and $3000 was recorded as $2500. Table I
provides a summary of and descriptive statistics
on variables used in the analyses.
ANALYSES
Analyses of covariance and multiple regression
techniques were used where body mass index was
treated as the dependent variable, and five
categories of schooling, age, age squared, income,
seven occupations, three marital status categories,
and work/activity status variables were treated as
covariates. Separate regressions were run for
women and men since prior studies showed great
disparities across gender in the correlation
between body mass and schooling41l0 The five
schooling categories were: 0 to 7 years, 8 to 11
years, 12 years, 13 to 15 years, and 16 and over.

The first category, 0 to 7, corresponds to grammar
or elementary school in the US; 8 to 11 cor-
responds to some high school; 12 implies a high
school diploma; 13 to 15 corresponds to some
college; and 16 and over means a completed
college education or more. Age and marital status
categories are widely recognised covariates of
obesity.4-l Occupation, income, and activity, eg,
retired, student, disabled, and homemaker, are
all known to be strongly correlated with
education. 15-17
Two different analyses of covariance were con-
ducted on each of the four gender/race groups.
The first included the five schooling categories
together with age, age squared, and marital status
(columns 1 and 3 in tables II and III). The second
included the five schooling categories and all
known confounding variables: age through work/
activity status (columns 2 and 4 in tables II and
III). These analyses allowed for comparisons
between schooling-body mass index relationships
which did not control for the well known
associations among education, occupation,
income, and work/activity status.
In addition, two different sets of weighted
multiple regressions were applied. The first
weighted multiple regression set treated the five
schooling categories as dummy variables (this is
equivalent to analysis of covariance).'8 The sec-
ond multiple regression approach treated school-
ing as a continuous variable. Again, two
regressions in each set were run within each
gender/race category, as described above. The
weighted multiple regression techniques were
used since NHANES I is a stratified and clustered
sample. Unweighted multiple regressions may
result in inefficient parameter estimates and
biased standard errors since the regression errors
within strata and groups are often correlated. 19 To
estimated regressions properly for this sample,
the weighted multiple regression routines
available in PCCARP were used.20
Results
Weighted and unweighted analysis of covariance
and multiple regressions yielded similar results.
The potential bias from using a stratified and
clustered sample appeared minimal in these
analyses ofthe NHANES I data. Thus the results
presented here are for the first and most familiar
technique, analysis of covariance.
Tables II and III present the analysis of
covariance results for women and men. The first
row indicates the mean body mass index for each
of the four subsamples. The next five rows
present the mean body mass indices, for each of
the five schooling categories, together with their
95% confidence intervals. Two sets of results
apply to each of the two analyses of covariance.
The first included only a few covariates: age, age
squared, and four marital status categories
(columns 1 and 3). The second included age,
age squared, marital status categories, income,
seven occupations, and variables for work/activity
status (columns 2 and 4). In the interest ofbrevity,
only the results pertaining to schooling will be
presented and discussed. A longer version of the
paper which discusses all results is available from
the authors.

Gender, race, and body mass
WOMEN
The results in table II and for figs 1 and 2 provide
contrasting pictures for the body mass index-
education association between black and white
women. With increases in education in the early
years, from less thanor equal to 7 to between 8 and
11, body mass index increased in black women.
After 8 to 11 years, average body mass index fell
for black women. The inverted "U" for black
women was most pronounced in analysis of
covariance results which did not control for
occupation, income, and work/activity. For white
women, on the other hand, body mass index
continuously fell with increased schooling. This
continuous drop for white women is especially
clear in the analysis of covariance results which
controlled for occupation, income, and work/
activity.
While some ofthe confidence intervals in figs 1
and 2 overlap with other estimated means, the
patterns clearly suggest an inverted "U" for black
women and a simple inverse relation for white
women, and confidence intervals for the highest
means do not overlap with the lowest means. A
simple comparison oftwo overlapping confidence
intervals, however, cannot test for the overall
pattern since information on the three other
estimated means and confidence intervals would
be ignored. Statistically significant multiple
regression results on schooling and schooling
squared, both entered as continuous variables,
confirmed the upside down "U" for black women

the variation in body mass index. Each open dot
lies closer to the sample mean body mass index
than the corresponding filled dot. The association
adjusted for all the covariates for white women
(fig 2) suggests a strikingly linear relationship
between body mass index and education.
MEN
Results for the men appear in table III and in figs
3 and 4. Beginning with the 8 to 11 year category,
both male figures suggest an inverted "U" shape.
The height and magnitude of the inverted "U"
vary considerably between the black and white
men, however. The black male inverted "U" is
tall with steep sides. The white male "U" rises
and falls only slightly from the lowest to the
highest levels of education. Little variation is
present between the first two schooling
categories, grammar school and some high school,
for black men. The general shape of the
associations was only slightly altered once con-
trols are entered for occupation, income, work/
activity.

Years of schooling The results presented here shed further light on
the schooling and occupation debate as it applies
27 to obesity.'' 21 One economic model, the "institu-
tional" theory, would suggest that the schooling-
obesity association is indirect2l; that is, schooling
26 -
allows access to safe jobs and it is the safe jobs, not
TT T the schooling, that lead to better health. The
_B * ^^ "human capital" view, a second economic model,
25 -
holds that schooling improves health directly."
Better educated people more efficiently allocate
their resources, time, and energy to produce
24 -
health than less well educated people. In the
"human capital" view, schooling has a direct
l effect on obesity. Additional results from the

Years of schooling education may act as a surrogate for true causal
variables (eg, intelligence, ability to defer
27 gratification, self-efficacy, ambition, drive) which
in turn act to increase education level, to decrease
body mass, and to obtain a high status job.22 In
26 T T this third interpretation, interventions directed at
increasing education levels would not be expected
to influence body mass. However, recent research

and emaciation since lower education level is a risk
factor for most chronic diseases.25 For white
women, the linear inverse association was con-
sistent over the education span.
Perhaps the most controversial findings in
tables II and III pertain to the schooling and body
mass differences between men and women. An
upside down "U" was observed for both black
and white men. A strictly linear, inverse relation
was observed for white women, and an inverse
relation for black women beyond seven years of
schooling. While the inverse relation between
body mass and socioeconomic status among
women is not unique,8 the finding of a strictly
linear relation with only schooling for white
women while simultaneously accounting for the
separate influences of income, occupation, and
marital status is unique. Prior studies did not
control for the separate influences of income,
occupation, and marital status.
A number of "human capital" and "education
as surrogate" hypotheses are consistent with this
finding for white women and black women after
eight years of schooling. (1) Schooling has been
alleged to teach selfdiscipline, a skill which can be
transmitted to dieting and exercise (human capi-
tal).15 (2) Schooling may improve self efficacy,
that is, increase the belief that what happens to a
person is their own doing and that luck plays only
a small role (human capital).26 (3) Alternatively,
higher levels of schooling may be achieved by
those with greater self efficacy (education as
surrogate). The poorly educated may be more
likely to have acquired "learned helplessness"
than the better educated. Again, if this attitude
can be applied to health, more educated women
would more likely view their weight as under their
control thanless educated women.27 (4) Schooling
may be positively associated with time prefer-
ences or delayed gratification (education as sur-
rogate).22 More educated women may be more
thoughtful concerning the long term health con-
sequences ofobesity than less educated women; or
those innately possessing low time preference
(ability to delay gratification) may thereby achieve
higher education levels.
The curvilinear, upside down "U", relation
between body mass and schooling observed for
men is intriguing. Prior studies found positive as
well as negative relationships. There is no con-
sistency in the prior studies for men as there
appears to be for women.8 Ifthe relation is, in fact,
an inverted "U", it is not surprising that prior
researchers looking for linear relations have been
perplexed. If data included mostly men with
many years ofschooling, a negative relation would
be observed. If data were drawn from men with
few and many years of schooling, and if a linear
model was assumed, a different line with a shallow
positive slope would be observed.
The inverted "U" curve for men might be
explained by a high body mass being less likely to
indicate obesity for men than for women; that is,
body mass index may measure other attributes in
men, such as muscle mass. Alternatively, if the
broad occupation categories do not capture all the
variations in working conditions across jobs, then
three additional reasons can be suggested: more
men than women were employed in physically
demanding (fat consuming) jobs in the early
1970s; many of the most physically demanding
jobs requiredonly a high school diploma; and men
with desk jobs and many years ofschooling might
have been more likely to exercise than men with
desk jobs and few years ofschooling. Finally, very
little education could have resulted in poor health
and subsequent low body mass, especially among
black men, similar to what may have been seen in
black women.
In conclusion, the four gender/race categories
display four different body mass index and
education associations. These four associations
are only slightly altered by simultaneously
adjusting for two additional measures of socio-
economic status: occupation and income. Medical
experts frequently advocate government and
business interventions designed to improve
public health. The strong associations between
socioeconomic status and measures ofhealth have
led some experts to advocate policies to improve
the status of those in the lower socioeconomic
groups. But effective policies require a clear
understanding of the reasons why socioeconomic
status is correlated with health. Education,
occupation, and income are components of socio-
economics with different implications for inter-
vention. This study suggests that the correlations
between socioeconomic status and body mass are
largely due to education and not occupation or
income. Since the data used are cross sectional, we
cannot conclude that education results in high or
low body mass. Nevertheless, future researchers
interested in understanding the impact of
socioeconomic status on obesity may want to
direct greater attention to education rather than
either occupation or income.

SANITARY SUPERVISION
These endeavours to increase the salubrity of town-life by law, are not only open to the criticism
that the natural forces already at work render them unnecessary, and to the additional criticism that
some of the things strained after are impossible of legislative achievement, but it must further be
observed, that even the desiderata which acts of parliament will reach, can be so reached only
through very faulty instrumentalities. It is, in this case, as in many others, the peculiarity of what are
oddly styled "practical measures", that they supersede agencies which are answering well by
agencies which are not likely to answer well. Here is a heavy charge of inefficiency brought against
the drains, cesspools, stink-traps, &c., of England in general, and London in particular. The
evidence is voluminous and conclusive, and by common consent a verdict of proven is returned.
Citizens look grave and determine to petition parliament about it. Parliament promises to consider
the matter; and after the usual amount of debate, says-"Let there be a Board of Health".
Whereupon petitioners rub their hands, and look out for great things. They have unbounded
simplicity-these good citizens. Legislation may disappoint them fifty times running, without at all
shaking their faith in its efficiency. They hoped that Church abuses would be rectified by the
Ecclesiastical Commission: the poor curates can say whether that hope has been realized. Backed by
an act ofparliament, the Poor-Law Commissioners were to have eradicated able-bodied pauperism:
yet, until checked by the recent prosperity, the poors'-rates have been rapidly rising to their old
level. The New Building Act was to have given the people of London better homes; whereas, as we
lately saw, it has made worse the homes that most wanted improving. Men were sanguine of
reforming criminals by the silent system, or the separate system; but, if we are to judge by the
disputes oftheir respective advocates, neither of these plans is very successful. Pauper children were
to have been made into good citizens by industrial education; from all quarters, however, come
statements that a very large percentage of them get into gaol, or become prostitutes, or return to the
workhouse. The measures enjoined by the Vaccination Act of 1840 were to have exterminated
small-pox; yet the Registrar-General's reports show that the deaths from small-pox have been
increasing. And thus does year after year add to those abortive schemes, of which so many have been
quoted. Yet scarcely a doubt seems to arise, respecting the competency of legislators to do what they
profess. From the times when they tried to fix the value of money down to our own day, when they
have just abandoned the attempt to fix the price ofcorn, statesmen have been undertaking all kinds of
things, from regulating the cut of boot-toes, up to preparing people for Heaven; and have been
constantly failing, or producing widely-different results from those intended. Nevertheless such
inexhaustible faith have men, that, although they see this, and although they are daily hearing of
imbecilities in public departments-of Admiralty Boards that squander three millions a year in
building bad ships and breaking them up again-of Woods and Forests Commissioners who do not
even know the rental of the estates they manage-of bungling excise-chemists who commit their
chiefs to losing prosecutions, for which compensation has to be made-yet government needs but to
announce another plausible project, and men straightway hurrah, and throw up their caps, in the full
expectation of getting all that is promised.
