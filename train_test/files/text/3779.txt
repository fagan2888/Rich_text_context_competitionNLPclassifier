This is an explorative study that examines Ghanaian women's
perceptions on their lack of political decision making and
participation in the political governance of their country.
This study intends to contribute to the local gender and politi-
cal discourse and knowledge by documenting the voices of
women as they express their views and opinions on public
issues that affect their everyday political experiences and lack
of their political participation in their country. Despite sub-
stantial international progress and development efforts toward
the advancement of women in all societies, a large number of
women in developing countries, including Ghana, continue to
be victims of gender inequality and marginalization (Kurz &
Johnson-Welch, 2000). In Ghana, women have not been very
successful in altering their political and economic locations
and have not kept pace with their men in gaining much access
to political decision making and participation.
In 1995, out of a total of 200 seats, women occupied only
16 seats or formed 8% of the parliamentary seats. This num-
ber has been increased to 10.9% or 25 seats out of a total of
230 seats in the national election in 2004 (Inter-Parliamentary
Union, 2005). For example, Rwanda is one African coun-
try with the highest percentage of 49% of women parlia-
mentarians in that country's Parliament (British Broadcasting
Corporation [BBC], 2008). Also, women in South Africa,
Mozambique, and Seychelles hold one third of parliamen-
tary seats in their respective countries and Swaziland has one
third of seats in the upper house of Parliament, and Namibian
and Ugandan women hold 42% and one third of local govern-
ment seats, respectively (Hassim & Meintjes, 2005). The
average number of women legislators inAfrica has increased
from 1% to 14.6%, with the biggest increase occurring
between 1990 and 2004 (Tripp, 2005). According to Baden
(1999), improvements in women's political participation do
not automatically mean that they will be effective in articulat-
ing their gender interests in public domain. However, given
equal opportunity and access, women can effectively pro-
mote their gender and other related issues and interests.Also,
processes of democratization, changes in institutional rules,
and changes to the culture of politics and political parties that
encourage inclusion and equality are necessary for women's
effective political participation.

We Do Not Enjoy Equal Political
Rights: Ghanaian Women's Perceptions
on Political Participation in Ghana
Marie-Antoinette Sossou1
Abstract
This study explores Ghanaian women's perception and voices about issues of gender equality in terms of exercising their political
and decision-making rights in connection with political participation and governance in Ghana.The study uses demographic
survey and six different focus group discussions to capture the views of a total of 68 women with different educational,
socioeconomical,and occupational backgrounds,in two regions of the Ghana.The findings indicate that even though theoretically
the constitution of Ghana gives women equal rights as their male counterparts to actively participate in the governance of their
country, in practice, women face issues of gender-based power imbalance and discrimination in addition to other structural,
institutional, cultural, and traditional barriers and roadblocks.These barriers expose women as being inferior and second-class
citizens compared with their male counterparts in term of participation and inclusion in the governance of their country.The
study discusses the social and policy implications of the issues of gender inequality and social exclusion of women in politics and
calls for empowerment and organization of women and structural change in the system.

women's rights and gender issues such as the 1979 Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against
Women (CEDAW). Also, the 1992 constitution of the country
enumerates certain fundamental human rights and freedoms
for all people in the country. For example, Section 17,
Subsections 1 and 2, and Section 27 of the constitution have a
specific nondiscrimination provision that includes gender and
women's rights issues (Republic of Ghana, 1992). Despite
these constitutional provisions and international treaties, cus-
toms and cultural practices continue to adversely affect the
rights and lives of women in Ghana. According to the 2000
Ghana Living Standards Survey, Ghana has a total popula-
tion of 18.4 million and 44.1% of women as compared with
21.1% of men have no formal education and therefore could
not read or write.
Historically, women have been oppressed and dominated
by the patriarchal society in Ghana. Since the attainment of
independence in Ghana, women have increasingly moved
into the paid labor force; however, women still lag behind men
in all sectors. In most traditional Ghanaian communities,
the inferior status of women was quite evident. Women were
taught to accept their position through the socialization pro-
cess, including their initiation rites. They were taught to be
obedient wives and to respect their elders. They were told
that a man could marry more than one woman (Manu 1984;
Nukunya, 1969; Oppong, 1973). The inferior position of
women in traditional Ghanaian society was reinforced by a
number of factors, including social practices, religious beliefs,
and the practice of polygamy, child marriage, and widow
inheritance. Many of these practices are still found today in
some places in the country.
Concerning access to education, the 2000 Population and
Housing Census in Ghana indicates that 54.3% of female aged
15 years and above have never been to school despite efforts
being made to increase girls'education in the country. Gender
parity between girls and boys has almost been achieved at the
preschool or early childhood education level. However, the
gap begins to widen from the basic or primary school level to
junior high and high school levels. For example, at the junior
secondary school or junior high school level, the percentage
of girls and boys were 44.9% and 55.1%, respectively, in
1999 and 2000 school years. The gender gap still widens at
both high school postsecondary levels, with female constitut-
ing only 33% at high schools and postsecondary institutions
(Ghana Statistical Service, 2002). Despite the introduction
of free compulsory and universal basic education policy
(FCUBE) in 1994, girls' enrolment in schools continues to
be low, especially in the rural communities of the country.
School taxes and indirect costs such as book user fees, school
uniforms, and school supplies have made education costly,
even though enrolment is free in the public schools.
Politically, women in Ghana are underrepresented in the
sense that few of them hold political offices or participate in
formal political organizations. Their invisibility can be docu-
mented at all levels of government. Two interrelated factors
explain the political underrepresentation of women in Ghana.
First, politics is viewed by most men and women as the quint-
essential male sphere of action, one in which women are both
unwelcome and ineffective. Second, most politically active
women are members of the elite group. Better educated
and wealthier, these women often pursue a political agenda
that reflects their class rather than their gender interests
(House-Midamba, 1990).
Rationale ofThis Study
Lack of gender equality and women's subordination in Ghana
is the focal point of this study, and without equal participation
by women in public decision making, policies are likely to be
gender-blind, causing deleterious short- and long-term effects
on women, children, and families. The premise of this study
is that the Ghanaian society can function better for all its
members when both men and women are equally included and
involved in development processes, public policy making, and
political decision making and participation. Therefore, hear-
ing the voices of women concerning their views and percep-
tions of their lack of equal political participation is essential
for the gender equality discourse.
Method
This study employs an explorative qualitative research using
phenomenology as the primary research methodology. The
essence of using phenomenology as a research methodology
is to understand the phenomena, things, or events in the
everyday world, from the viewpoint of the experiencing
persons, and in this study, the views of Ghanaian women on
gender and political participation. The data collection tech-
nique used in this study was focus group discussions and
demographic survey. An interview guide consisting of open-
ended questions on the phenomenon of gender equality was
used for the collection of data from the focus group discus-
sions. The demographic survey was utilized in collecting
socioeconomic data concerning education, religion, occupa-
tion, age, and ethnicity as represented in Table 1. The study
took place in two regions, namely, Greater Accra and the
Volta Regions in Ghana. These regions were selected for a
number of reasons. First, Accra is the national capital and has
a total population of about three million people according to
2000 national census. In addition, the following factors were
also taken into account: the size of the population; the sizes
of the migrant population; the diversity of cultural, educa-
tional, economical, religious, and ethnic patterns; and the
heterogeneity of the people and groups. The inclusion of the
Volta region and the rural communities was meant to create
some balance fairness to the rural setting, divergence, and
variations. Volta region is more homogeneous as compared
with Greater Accra region, thus, its inclusion.
Two groups were identified and purposively selected
through the Women Unit of the Department of Community
Sossou 3
Development in Accra as this department is responsible for
organizing women groups for social development. The other
four groups were selected by the use of snowball technique
with assistance from teachers and university students identi-
fied by the researcher. In all, six focus groups, made up of
68 participants, were held in two rural and four urban locations
within the two regions. The main purpose for choosing a
focus group discussion as the data collection technique was to
draw on the women's attitudes, feelings, beliefs, experiences,
and reactions in a way that would not be feasible using other
methods, for example, observation, one-to-one interviewing,
or questionnaires. These attitudes, feelings, and beliefs may
be partially independent of the group or the social setting but
are more likely to be revealed through the social gathering
and the interaction of being in a group discussion.
The interview guide with the relevant questions concerning
gender equality and related issues guided the group discus-
sions. The main question that formed the basis of this study is
"How do women understand the meaning and the concept of
gender equality in Ghana?" Gender equality is taken to mean
that men and women should have equal conditions and
opportunities for realizing their full human rights and poten-
tials. As gender equality is a broad concept and difficult to
comprehend by the participants, the interview guide was
constructed with a breakdown of the term of gender equality
into concrete or specific relevant issues concerning women's
subordination and oppression. The participants were asked
two specific questions concerning their perceptions about
their political participation as women in Ghana. For exam-
ple, the participants were asked to describe themselves in
terms of gender equality and their political participation as
women. Second, the participants were asked to discuss whether
it is possible to have a woman as a president in Ghana. These
questions were posed to explore women's own knowledge,
roles, and voices about their gender equality and political par-
ticipation as women. A number of women have held political
positions as women ministers and heads of departments, hence
the need to explore the second question of a woman ever
aspiring to become a president in Ghana.
The discussions took place in local classrooms, church
halls, and a community center. Two research assistants with
master's degree assisted this researcher collecting data during
the focus group discussions. They assisted with interpreta-
tion and translation of research questions from English to the
appropriate local dialects to the research participants. The
interpretation and translation were essential during the rural
focus group discussions as most of the participants spoke
only their local dialect. The other four focus group discus-
sions were conducted in English as most of the participants
were literates. All the group discussions were tape recorded
and later transcribed verbatim by a paid transcriber, the
research assistants, and the researcher. The transcriptions
were supplemented by field notes taken during the group dis-
cussions. An Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval was
sought and approved by the researcher's institution and as a
result, consent forms spelling out the reasons for the research
and the essence of confidentiality and voluntary participation
was read, signed, and thumbprinted by all literate and illiter-
ate participants before data collection took place. To protect
participants' anonymity, only generalized descriptions of the
groups, sites, and themes are presented in the findings.
Research Participants
Purposive sampling technique was used to select 68 partici-
pants to participate in six different focus group discussions.
The participants were from a broad cross-section of the
Ghanaian population in terms of ethnicity, age, family situa-
tion, economic situation, education, religion, and patterns of
residence that is both rural and urban (Table 1). As Ghana is
ethnically diverse, an effort was made to include participants
from most of the major ethnic groups in the country. Two
regions were selected for this study and the selection was

and the second region was more homogeneous and less cul-
turally diverse.
Data Analysis
Phenomenological methods are particularly effective at
bringing to the fore the experiences and perceptions of indi-
viduals from their own perspectives. Adding an interpretive
dimension to phenomenological research enables it to be
used as the basis for practical theory and allows it to inform,
support, or challenge policy and social action. Therefore, the
Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) by Smith,
Jarman, and Osborn (1999) was adopted as a guideline for this
analysis. This analysis advocates an idiographic approach,
where the researcher engages in close textual analysis of tran-
scripts before moving on to begin to look for commonalities
between individuals. By this process, an idiographic, case-
study approach is outlined, where the analysis slowly builds
from the reading of individual cases to claims for a group.
The aim of IPA is to explore in detail the participant's view of
the topic under investigation. Thus, the approach is phenom-
enological in that it is concerned with an individual's personal
perception or account of an object or event as opposed to an
attempt to produce an objective statement of the object or
event itself (Smith et al, 1999). Hence, the interpretation of
the phenomena in this study is to provide insight into how,
through the human situation, the phenomena of gender equal-
ity or inequalities come to have personal meaning, a lived-
through significance that may not always be transparent to
consciousness.
The actual data analysis began with verbatim transcription
of the focus group discussion tapes. The audio-recorded tapes
were played repeatedly and transcribed verbatim. After the
transcription, time was spent reading through the transcripts a
number of times and making notes of interesting or significant
words, statements, and key words that captured the essence of
the topic. In addition, connecting themes that reflect connec-
tions with previous sections of the interview were searched
for and noted. I took notice of similarities and differences
in themes about what the participants said and also took
notice of similarities and differences in the themes from both
the urban and rural groups. I made a list of all the emergent
themes and ordered them coherently. This form of analysis
involved a close interaction between the text, myself, and
an attempt to understand what a particular participant was
saying and at the same time drawing on my own interpreta-
tive resources. To introduce some order and form into the
analysis, I decided to use the master-theme list from the first
interview to begin the analysis of the second and the subse-
quent ones.
I looked for more instances of similar themes identified in
the first group discussion in the remaining discussions and
also identified new themes that came up as well. The next
process was the arrangement of the related patterns into coher-
ent clusters, and this made it possible to identify emergent
common themes. The decision regarding the selection of the
themes was guided by the rule of two confirmations and no
contradiction (Miles & Huberman, 1994). This means that at
least two responses from the participants confirmed the
themes as essential lived experiences. The analytical discus-
sions of the themes are supported with direct quotations from
the participants' narratives. Direct quotations reveal partici-
pants' depth of emotions, their experiences, and their basic
perceptions of the issue.
Credibility andTrustworthiness
For Moustakas (1994), establishing the truth of things begins
with the researcher's perception. He also discusses verifi-
cation using informant feedback. In this study, verification
was carried out mostly by discussing the findings with
some of the participants in an informal group discussion,
after the initial transcription was done. The transcripts
were read and interpreted to four groups of the participants
for their comments and views. Three urban groups and
one rural group were selected and convened again for this
member check. These participants were satisfied with the
report and readily accepted it as their own ideas or as their
authentic voices. Another technique used in establishing
credibility of this study was peer review or peer debriefing.
This process involved the discussion of the findings with
the research assistants who assisted with the fieldwork.
This peer review provided the opportunity for us to discuss
some of the emerging themes, the plights, and the everyday
struggles of the participants and ideas for future research
projects.
Research Findings
The study identifies three main themes, which are (a) We are
relegated to the background, (b) we face cultural, educational,
and financial barriers, and (c) we occupy the lower positions
in political parties.
We Are Relegated to the Background
The discussion of these three main themes revealed that
women in Ghana do not enjoy equal political participation in
Ghana.According to most of the participants, they experienced
gender inequality and discrimination even in the political par-
ties they belong to as members. The findings discussed the
opinions and admission of both rural and urban participants,
educated and uneducated, about their lack of active political
involvement and participation. A number of urban partici-
pants referred to their position as women as "being relegated
to the background." These participants were of the view that
as women, the Ghanaian society does not give them equal
chance as compared with their male counterparts and so they
Sossou 5
play second fiddle to the men. These opinions have been
expressed in direct quotations as follows:
Tradition has a tremendous impact on the situation of
the Ghanaian woman. A woman is always in the back-
ground and when a woman is outspoken, she is given
all kinds of names.
Our situation is difficult because of our entrenched tra-
ditional beliefs and norms. The traditional notion is that
men are the heads and this notion is working through
every sphere of life and including the political sphere.
Men do not encourage us and they look down on us,
and would not even vote for a woman as a candidate.
They discount whatever we say as "women's talk."
Even in parliament women are not allowed to exercise
their rights. We do not often hear our female parlia-
mentarians speak because the men take the floor all
the time.
We Face Cultural, Educational,
and Financial Barriers
The participants described their personal experiences as being
characterized by negative, cultural, and traditional practices
toward women; lack of adequate education; and struc-
tural financial barriers as obstacles that militate against their
equal participation, even if they are interested in politics. Both
rural and urban participants identified some of the barriers
that prevent women from effectively participating in poli-
tics or daring to stand as a parliamentary or a presidential
candidate in Ghana. For example, in terms of financial oppor-
tunities, a number of urban participants believe
For example, women do not have the necessary
resources and capital to engage in active politics
because politic is very expensive and most women
are handicapped financially.
The men for too long have dominated us both finan-
cially and I think women in this country are getting fed
up with the situation.
The participants also discussed the negative effects of the
cultural and social educational program that socializes young
women from birth into roles that are removed from the world
of public decision making. They asserted that the aim of
girls' training was generally to make them into good wives
and mothers. On the contrary, a number of urban participants
believed that if women are given the educational opportuni-
ties and proper training, they could become politically active
and even stand for election as a president of the country one
day. Some of the comments were as follows:
I believe that with time and the required education,
Ghana could have a female president. However, for
now, we women still believe that men are better
endowed than women are.
It is only possible for women if our cultural norms are
relaxed to allow women to further their education.
Before an individual can be totally liberated, the one
must be educated because knowledge is power and if
one does not know how to deliver herself when in dif-
ficulty, one cannot make progress in life. Therefore
society has an obligation to help women and women
must organize to fight for their rights.
Culturally, participants also expressed the barriers of mari-
tal obligations to husbands, children, and families as another
obstacle to their inability to fully engage in politics.According
to some of them, their husbands and family members are often
reluctant to have their wives and women in their households in
the public domain. The following comments were expressed
by a few rural participants as follows:
Our husbands will not even encourage us and they will
even tell us the political party we should vote for.
One could get into serious problem with the husband
should one vote for another political party and since
women are so concerned about the stability of their
homes, they tend to obey their husbands in matters
like this.
A number of urban participants also believed that women
as a group are not very supportive of each other when it
comes to supporting women in politics. They believed that
women would not even vote for a fellow woman. They
expressed their views as follows:
Women would not even vote for a female president
even if she has the courage to stand for the position.
All depends on the women, if only we stop being each
other's enemy. We are in the majority yet we are the
same people who will assassinate the character of the
female presidential candidate.
Women are their worst enemies because most women
are jealous and do not do much to improve their lots
and if a fellow woman decides to excel, we defame the
person and do nothing to encourage one another.
I do not think any Ghanaian woman would dare to
stand for presidency because women in general
look down upon themselves and do not support each
other.
6 SAGE Open
In examining the possibility of a woman being a presiden-
tial candidate in Ghana, this question was posed to the groups
because, some women have held various ministerial positions
in the country in the past and it is crucial to know their views
on the possibility of Ghana ever having a female presiden-
tial candidate. This question generated an argument among a
group of urban participants in relation to the type of woman
who could dare put herself up for a presidential candidate in
Ghana. Some participants believed a single woman or a sin-
gle mother with no marital affiliations to man could be an
effective political leader. Their assertion was based on the
belief that as a single woman, she would not be burdened
with marital obligations and conflict of interest or harassment
from the husband.
A number of urban participants expressed their views as
It is possible to have a female president but it will not be
easy to achieve because our traditions pose a stumbling
block. Such a woman would be ridiculed and snubbed
by the men and even by her own family members.
Only a single mother or woman who has experienced
the rough edges of life would want to venture into the
presidency. This is so because she will have a tough
personality that will enable her to organize women
very well.
I support the notion that a female president of this
country must be a single mother because my sister who
was a Member of Parliament in 1992 incurred the dis-
pleasure of her husband because of her political ambi-
tion. The husband threatened to divorce her but she
however ignored the threat.
I do not agree that only a single woman could become
a president. A married woman could become a presi-
dent too if women are able to get over petty squabbles,
attitudinal problems and their inferiority complex and
societal prejudices.
We Occupy the Lower
Positions in Political Parties
This is the third main theme, and it relates to participants'
individual experiences and challenges concerning their mem-
bership in political parties. The urban participants asserted
men have held national leadership positions in all political
parties since independence in 1957 to date. They attributed
the lack of political support for female candidates to lack of
political experience, male norms, and structures that prohib-
ited female participation. They also asserted that the negative
cultural norms and attitudes toward women contribute to lack
of leadership-oriented training programs and political educa-
tion for women. According to them, these shortcomings are
oftentimes reflected in voting patterns, media coverage of
female politicians and political intimidation, and harassment
of women politicians in the country.
A participant sums the low position of women in political
parties as follows:
When one takes a look at the roles women play in the
political parties, one would realize that women have
not yet taken up the challenge to rise up to the top. The
highest position the woman is given in a political party
is that of a women's organizer and not as a presidential
candidate.
Discussion and Implications
The Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing (1995)
and the Beijing Platform for Action have provided new
impetus for governments and civil society organizations to
address gender inequalities in society at all levels. Gender
mainstreaming is one of the approaches to advancing gender
equality, and it involves addressing gender inequalities in all
aspects of development, across all sectors and programs.
Mainstreaming is not simply about ensuring that women's
position is improved within existing frameworks which are
dominated by men. Gender is mainstreamed when the devel-
opment process and frameworks are transformed in ways
which ensure the participation and empowerment of women
as well as men in all aspects of life, especially in political
decision-making structures.
The findings of this study indicate that Ghanaian women
are still on a long winding path to achieving gender equality
and equal political decision making and participation in their
country. An outstanding feature of these participants' insight
is the admission of their low political participation as women
in Ghana and this admission did not significantly differ by
education, income, and social class. Surprisingly, the major-
ity of the participants in this study could be classified as being
in the low-middle, socioeconomic class. Most of them had at
least post­high school and some college education and they
worked as professionals and semiprofessionals in their vari-
ous occupations as teachers and public servants. These fac-
tors indicate their knowledge and awareness of the challenges
they faced as women and the cultural and traditional block-
ades they have to overcome to achieve equal political partici-
pation. In addition, they identified their inferior position as
women compared with the men and their own negative activi-
ties and lack of support for their fellow women as some obsta-
cles. Other factors identified are the structural barriers of male
domination of the political bureaucracy, institutional sexism,
and the patriarchal system that imposed limitations on women
and discount them as inferior and second fiddle to the men.
They also discussed the cultural socialization and sexist
attitudes and perceptions that put women in the gender box
of being mothers, wives, and care providers for their hus-
bands, children, and other family members. Lack of politi-
cal training and education, poor access to financial resources,
Sossou 7
and preparation for working in the political arena were also
discussed as other barriers to women's political involvement
and participation in Ghana.
The study has also revealed the display of tokenism in
terms of putting a few women in decision making and politi-
cal positions as showcases. The political system is one of the
most powerful structures of gender inequality in Ghana. This
is confirmed by the participants discussions on the negative
attitude of harassment and hostility of men toward women
who dared to enter into politics. It is evident that Ghana has
experienced some modest increase in women's participa-
tion in leadership and public decision making. The number
of women in Parliament has increased from 16 in 2000 to
25 out of 230 members in 2004. Out of 20 cabinet ministers,
only 2 are women and only 2 ministers of state and 5 deputy
ministers are women. There are only 4 women out of a total
of 45 members of the Council of State. This is the council
that advises the president on national affairs of the country.
For the first time in the history of the country, the chief jus-
tice of the Supreme Court is a woman and the speaker of
country's Parliament is also a woman. Likewise, at the local
or the district level of the country, women's participation has
increased remarkably from 3% to 35.5% in 2003. That is, out
of 1,843 district assembly appointments, 655 of them were
women. This increase still falls short of the 40% target set by
the national plan of action (Ministry ofWomen and Children's
Affairs, 2003).
The challenge facing Ghanaian women politically is not
unique to women in Ghana alone. Several studies from other
African countries indicate the same predicaments for women
across the continent. Ferguson and Katundu (1994) discussed
a number of negative reports about women who dared to
enter into politics in Zambia. For example, they found that
some Zambia women were threatened with divorce and for-
bidden by their husbands to enter into politics and even in
national Parliaments; women have difficulties being accepted
for who they are and are not taken seriously and/or even lis-
tened to. Tamale (1999) in her study of women in parliamen-
tary politics in Uganda found that women parliamentarians
are frequently subjected to humiliating sexual stereotypes and
derogatory remarks and sexual harassment. Legislation for
various forms of equality has been passed and continued to
be in effect. However, the pace of actual change that will be
beneficial to women is very slow. Even though women are
becoming active in politics, they are still too often subordi-
nates in the system. It is evident that educated women and
gender activists who have shown interest in politics have
been assaulted physically to teach them to stay out of poli-
tics (Nzomo, 1997). Politicians and political leaders view
contemporary African women politicians as ambitious and
as embodying interests that are antithetical to the interests of
the state.
Ongom (1999) states that the belief that women are good as
cooks, sex providers, and juniors are still persistent. For exam-
ple, women are given ministries that are considered useless to
the economy and therefore not so demanding. This is simply
to prove the point that women cannot take on hectic jobs. For
instance, out of the 26 cabinet ministers in Uganda, only 6 are
women, and they occupy very silent ministerial posts that are
considered not of utmost importance, and out of the total of
35 state ministers, only 11 are women. This means, out of
66 ministers in Uganda, only 17 are women signifying less
than 1/3 of the total percentage (Ongom, 1999).
Ongom (1999) also states that women in Uganda, just like
women in Ghana, lag behind in decision making. Although
clear legal systems are in place to address women's partici-
pation in policy making, the implementation of this policy is
derailed by gender discrimination in all sectors. The dilemma
women face today is how to change the attitudes and percep-
tions that they cannot perform or engage in full decision
making that affect society. Namibia and South Africa have
constitutions that provide for affirmative actions to enhance
the numbers of women in policy- and decision-making posi-
tions. In South Africa, 20% of parliamentary seats and 50%
of local governing councils seats are reserved for women
(African Center for Women/Economic Commission forAfrica
[ACW/ECA], 1998). Angola, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe also
have quota legislation guaranteeing certain numbers of
women in legislative assemblies. However, vigilance is still
called for to prevent backsliding and political manipulation
(ACW/ECA, 1998).
However, six African countries are leading in terms of
women's representation in national assemblies due to affir-
mative action and quotas. These countries are Rwanda lead-
ing with 48.8%, Mozambique with 34.8%, and South Africa
with 32.8% of women representation in parliament. Burundi
has 30.5% of women in parliament and Seychelles has
29.4% of women in parliament. In addition, Namibia has
26.9% of women representation in parliament and Ghana
has only 10.9% of women in parliament (Inter-Parliamentary
Union, 2005). Also, for the first time in the postindepen-
dence period, a number of African women began to aspire to
political leadership at the national and local levels. Female
faces and voices are beginning to be seen and heard in some
African countries even though their impact is still minimal
and their obstacles daunting. The 1990s had been credited as
a decade of beginning for women in politics in Africa. Until
this period, it was unheard of for women to run for the presi-
dency in Africa.
In 1998, two women in Kenya ran in the presidential elec-
tion of that country and two other women in Tanzania and
Nigeria also sought their political parties' nominations in
the presidential primaries in 1995 and 1998, respectively.
Although they were unsuccessful in their struggle for politi-
cal power, they have set an important precedence in their
respective countries and have shown that given the chance,
women can equally become presidents in their own right and
Liberia has taken the lead by electing the first female presi-
dent in Africa (Inter-Parliamentary Union, 2005). This is an
indication that there is a chance for more female presidential

candidates on the future horizon in Ghana and other African
countries.
Conclusion
The attainment of full political participation of women in
Ghana is more beyond mere tokenism and political party
nominations. It is important to explore the issues surround-
ing the ideology of gender relations and power relations.
The various institutions and structures, such as the family,
the educational system, the religious institutions as well as the
social, economic, legal, and political structures in the society
must undergo major structural transformation that will stop
reproducing unequal power and gender relations. According
to Reynolds (1999), the sociocultural barriers to the represen-
tation of women can be overcome but the process evolves
time and it also entails both male and female coming to
accept the legitimacy of women in positions of power. That
is, until every voter sees the election of women into political
position as normal and not something unusual or just based
on tokenism.
To overcome the institutionalized power relations and
bring about total transformation in the system, actual pro-
cesses of empowerment have to occur at several levels. The
empowerment process must challenge and change the set of
ideas, attitudes, beliefs, and practices in gender relations; in
institutions and structures such as in the family, the house-
hold, the villages, the market places, and the churches; and in
the local communities. Simon (1990) refers to empowerment
as a series of attacks on subordination of every description
such as psychic, physical, cultural, sexual, legal, political, eco-
nomical, and technological. However, the empowerment of
women is not only just an issue of women but also a gender
issue, which necessitates the reexamination of gender rela-
tionships by both men and women together. It is also a devel-
opment issue, in that women who become empowered must
also become active not only in economic activities but also in
exerting pressure and influence on political, social, and legal
issues concerning women.
The full political participation of women in the sociopoliti-
cal development of Ghana is not just an issue of affirmative
action and implementation of quota systems. It is a social jus-
tice and human rights issue that requires social transformation
and change in the attitudes, institutional and cultural structures
of the whole society. According to Mosse (1993), a successful
women's organization encourages in its members a capacity
to interact with a wide range of public systems and struc-
tures, and in time, is able to transform members into active par-
ticipants in the development of goods, services, and resources,
rather being passive recipients or targets. She argues that
the long-term growth of expertise and confidence within
women's organizations, and their increasing effectiveness in
the public domain, are essential to the process of structural
change.
Limitations
This study is a qualitative study that used purposive and
convenience sample of only 68 participants in six focus group
discussions. Hence, the selection excluded other women from
other regions and higher socioeconomic social classes across
the country. The data were collected through focus group
discussions based mainly on self-reported personal experi-
ences and opinions. Based on the study's qualitative approach,
small sample size, selection bias, and subjectivity, precau-
tions should be taken in generalizing the findings of this
study to other groups without further study. Given these
limitations, however, the study provides direct evidence from
Ghanaian women concerning their gender discrimination and
call for action.
