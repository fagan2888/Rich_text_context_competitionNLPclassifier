Abstract
Objective: to determine whether medication use patterns in community-dwelling elderly people vary with level of
cognitive function-dementia, cognitive impairment (but not dementia) and intact cognition.
Design: cross-sectional survey.
Setting: a five-county area of central North Carolina, USA.
Participants: 520 members of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly.
Measurements: medication use in the previous 2 weeks was ascertained during a interview in the patient's home
and was coded as to prescription and therapeutic class status. Cognitive status, the primary independent variable,
was divided into: (i) dementia (n = 100); (ii) cognitive impairment but not dementia (n = 117); and (iii) cognitively
intact (n = 303). The dependent variables were any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication use (liS non-
use); number of prescription or OTC medications used; and prescription and OTC use combined within major
therapeutic classes. Multivariate analyses controlled for socio-demographic characteristics, health status, functional
status and access to health care.
Results: the use of any prescription medication was similar in the three groups. The demented were significantly
less likely than cognitively impaired people to use any OTC medications (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.45, 0.93),
cardiovascular medications (OR = 0.70,95% CI = 0.49,0.99) and analgesiCS (OR = 0.54,95% CI = 0.39,0.75). As a
combined group, those who were demented and cognitively impaired were less likely than the cognitively intact
group to use any OTC medications (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.65, 0.92). Compared with the cognitively impaired
subjects, the demented group took fewer prescription medications ((3 coefficient = - 0.31, 95% CI = - 0.59,
-0.03) and similar numbers of OTC medications. Compared with those who were cognitively intact, the combined
group of demented and cognitively impaired subjects took fewer OTC medications ((3 coefficient = - 0.14, 95%
CI = -0.23, -0.05) and similar numbers of prescription medications.
Conclusion: increasing level of cognitive dysfunction is associated with decreased use of OTe, cardiovascular and
analgesic medications and the use of fewer prescription medications. These results suggest important differences in
medication use patterns among community-dwelling elderly people who vary in cognitive status.

Introduction
Investigation of medication use patterns in a popu-
lation (or pharmaco-epidemiology) is useful for
describing variations in medication use and potentially
detecting overuse or underuse of medications [1].
Pharmaco-epidemiological studies are important in
elderly community residents with dementia or cogni-
tive impairment because these conditions may be risk
factors for over- and under-medication as well as for
non-compliance and adverse drug reactions [2 - 4]. In
addition, pharmaco-epidemiological studies can deter-
mine whether medications increase or decrease the
risk of a given condition [1]. This is important in
dementia or cognitive impairment because medica-
tions may cause or exacerbate these conditions and
medications are among the most common causes of
reversible confusional states in elderly people [5 - 7]. In
addition, recent pharmaco-epidemiological studies
have suggested that certain medications, such as anti-
inflammatory agents, may be protective against demen-
tia or cognitive impairment [8-11]. These phenomena
can affect many elders given that estimates of the
prevalence of dementia and cognitive impairment in
persons over 65 years old are as high as 10% and 20%,
respectively [12].
However, few investigators have studied medica-
tion use patterns in demented or cognitively impaired
community-dwelling elderly people. The few studies
of medication use in demented subjects define
dementia by clinical criteria and typically focus on
Alzheimer's disease. In these studies, Alzheimer's
disease patients averaged fewer medications per
person and took more psychotropic medications
than old people who were cognitively intact [13-
15]. Studies of medication use in cognitively impaired
people identify cognitive impairment in terms of
scores below standardized cut-points on cognitive
screening tests. We reported that cognitively
impaired elderly subjects were significantly less
likely to use any prescription or non-prescription
(or over-the-counter; OTC), medications than cogni-
tively intact older people in the Duke Established
Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE) [16].
No studies have reported on medication use
patterns across different levels of cognitive
function (i.e. dementia, cognitive impairment but
not dementia and intact cognition) within a given
population. In the present study we distinguished
dementia from cognitive impairment and intact cog-
nition in a subsample of Duke EPESE participants
to examine medication use in these groups. The
objective of the study was to determine whether
patterns of medication use among community-
dwelling older people vary with level of cognitive
function.

Methods
Participants
The participants were selected sample members of the
Duke EPESE [17, 18] who participated in a separate
study of the incidence and prevalence of dementia in
North Carolina, USA. The Duke EPESE conducted a
baseline face-to-face interview in 1986-87 (n = 4162)
and a second follow-up face-to-face interview in 1989-
90 among the remaining participants (n = 3337). The
independent dementia study was conducted after
the second interview between 1991 and 1994. The
dementia study participants were selected by the
following criteria: (i) a two-point or greater decline
between the first and second interview on the Short
Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, a 10-item stand-
ardized cognitive screening instrument [19] or (ii) the
need for a proxy respondent at the second interview
but not the baseline interview. A 10% random sample
of the remaining participants was also included. The
selection procedure was intended to maximize the
presence of persons with cognitive impairment and
dementia and to identify a sample ofpersons who were
cognitively intact.
Ofthe 3337 sample members of Duke EPESE seen in
1989-90, 547 met the selection criteria. Twenty-seven
participants were excluded because they no longer
lived in the interviewing catchment area, were too
physically ill to participate, were acutely disoriented or
refused. The current analysis is therefore based on 520
participants.
Data collection
Data for this study came from the Duke EPESE and the
dementia study. The Duke EPESE provided data on age,
race, sex and years of education [17]. The dementia
study obtained separate data on current marital status,
medication use, cognition, basic activities of daily
living, eight common chronic health conditions,
hospitalizations in the previous year and whether the
participant had a regular primary-care phYSician. The
dementia study interviewers administered a structured
questionnaire in the home to participants or inform-
ants, typically a close family member, to obtain the
information.
The dementia study interviewers asked participants
or informants to show them all prescription and OTC
medications taken in the past 2 weeks. OTC drugs are
medications that can be purchased without a prescrip-
tion or doctor's orders (e.g. laxatives, analgesics). The
name and dosage form of each medication taken in the
previous 2 weeks were recorded from the container. A
trained pharmacy technician assigned each medication
a unique four-digit generic code from the DPICS and
INDPICS coding system [20] using a locally developed
interactive data-entry program [21]. The program
numerically coded each medication to indicate
whether it was a prescription or OTC product and
assigned the medications to non-overlapping therapeu-
tic medication classes based on American Hospital
Formulary Service Drug Information [22].
The dementia study interviewers administered the
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's
Disease (CERAD) neuropsychology battery to partici-
pants [23]. This test battery includes the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) [24], a lO-item word list
learning, recall and recognition task, a measure of
verbal fluency, confrontation naming (abbreviated 15-
item Boston naming test) and a constructional praxis
task. The clock drawing test, which is part of the
CERAD clinical battery [23] was also included. Addi-
tional information on memory, ability to perform
activities of daily living and change in personality was
obtained from an informant.
The following criteria were used to refer a partici-
pant for a clinical dementia evaluation: a participant or
informant report of memory problems, an inadequate
clock drawing, an MMSE score less than 24 for whites
[24] and less than 18 for blacks [25]' a recall of three
items or less from the word list learning task [26] or the
interviewer's assessment that dementia was potentially
present. These criteria were designed to be broadly
inclusive of potential dementia.
Determination of cognitive status
Dementia
Based on the above criteria, 183 of the 520 study
participants were recommended for a clinical evalua-
tion for dementia. A geriatrician or specially trained
clinical research nurse performed the dementia evalua-
tion using the CERAD clinical battery, which was
designed to assess Alzheimer's disease and expanded to
include non-Alzheimer's disease dementias [23]. A
neurologist, geriatrician and clinical research nurse
diagnosed dementia and its aetiology in 100 of the
183 participants by clinical consensus using CERAD,
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-
IV and modified National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke- Alzheimer's
Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for
dementia and Alzheimer's disease [23, 27, 28]. Of the
demented subjects, 69 had Alzheimer's disease, either
alone or with additional components, 15 had vascular
dementia, in some cases with additional factors but
excluding Alzheimer's disease, while 16 had other
forms of dementia.
Cognitive impairment
Cognitive impairment, defined as abnormal responses
to cognitive testing in persons without dementia, was
Cognitive function and medication use patterns
ascertained in the remaining 420 participants using the
MMSE. The originally recommended and commonly
accepted clinical cut-off point on the MMSE for
identifying cognitive impairment is 23/24 [24]. In
order not to include cognitively intact elderly people
with little education in the cognitively impaired
sample, we modified these cut-off points to reflect
the population-based age and education norms pub-
lished by Crum et at. [29]. Once age and education
have been taken into account, the effect of race, while
important, is rarely substantive [25, 29-31].
Since the median age for the participants fell
between the age categories of 75-79 and 80-84, we
pro-rated the cut-off point identifying the 25th
percentile for these two age groups, separately for
those with 0-4 (cut-off point 17/18) and 5-8 years of
schooling (cut-off point 22/23). We selected the 25th
percentile rather than a cut-off point based on the
mean and standard deviation because the scores on the
MMSE are not normally distributed. Using these cut-off
points, 117 participants were identified as cognitively
impaired. These cognitively impaired participants did
not meet criteria for dementia at the time of the study
and constituted a group separate from the groups with
dementia or intact cognition.
Cognitively intact
This was defined as no evidence for dementia or
cognitive impairment after clinical examination or
having an MMSE score above the indicated cut-off
points. Using this definition, 303 participants were
cognitively intact.
Dependent variables
We were interested in the presence and extent of
prescription and OTC medication use and had three
types of dependent variables. First, we considered any
use of prescription medications versus no use and any
use of OTe medications versus no use. Second, we
examined the number of prescription or OTC medica-
tions used. Thirdly, we examined prescription and OTe
use combined within major therapeutic classes.
Independent variables
The primary independent variable was cognitive status
(dementia, cognitively impaired but not demented and
cognitively intact). As covariates, we selected variables
that may be associated with medication use behaviour
or possible confounders in order to control for them in
the analysis. The demographic variables were age
(years), race (black, white), sex, education (years of
schooling) and marital status (married, not married).
Physical functioning status was assessed by ability to
independently perform each of five activities of daily
living: bathing, grooming, dressing, transfer from bed
to chair and feeding oneself [32, 33]. Subjects who
495
K. E. Schmader et al.
were unable to perform one or more items indepen-
dently were compared with those who could perform
all items. Health status was assessed by the reported
presence of each of eight common chronic health
conditions (arthritis, cancer, diabetes, heart disease,
hypertension, stroke, thyroid dysfunction and pulmon-
ary disorder) and by the total number of these
conditions present. Health service use was assessed
by two variables: hospitalization overnight in the
previous year and whether the participant had a
regular primary-care physician.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used for initial comparison
of the cognitively intact, cognitively impaired and
demented. For univariate analyses, the X2 test was used
for categorical variables and analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used for continuous variables [34]. The
assumption of normality for ANOVA was examined. For
multivariate analyses, logistic regression was used
when the dependent variable was dichotomous (any
medication use versus non-use). Ordinary least-squares
regression was used when the dependent variable was
continuous (number of medications used) [35].
The multivariate regression models included the
covariates and two indicator variables that reflected
cognitive status. The indicator variables were calcu-
lated by orthogonal contrasts. The first indicator
contrasted a combined group of cognitively impaired
and demented participants with the group of cogni-
tively intact participants. The second variable con-
trasted the cognitively impaired with the demented
participants. These two variables permit all compar-
isons among the three groups to be examined. All of
the analyses were conducted using SAS software [36].
Results
Participant characteristics by cognitive status are
presented in Table 1. There were significant mean
age differences between the three groups. The
demented group were, on average, the oldest (83
years) followed by the cognitively impaired (80 years)
and cognitively intact (77 years) groups. The cogni-
tively impaired subjects were the most likely (73.5%)
and the cognitive intact were the least likely (52.8%) to
be black. Mean level of education differed significantly,
the demented population having on average the least
education (6.7 years) and the cognitively intact the
most education (8.8 years). Marital status followed a
similar pattern, with those who were demented least
likely to be married 07%) and those who were
cognitively intact the most likely to be married (38%).
With respect to health-related information, a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of the demented subjects had
impairments in functional status.

No significant differences were identified in the
mean number of chronic conditions or in diseases,
with the exception of stroke (reported in a larger
proportion of the demented) and arthritis (reported in
a smaller proportion of the demented). There were no
significant differences in hospitalization but registra-
tion with a regular doctor was significantly less
frequent in the demented group than for members of
the other two groups.
Table 2 provides information on medication use.
Although the mean number of prescription medica-
tions used was less in the demented group and a
smaller percentage of this group used any OTC
medications, the unadjusted analyses showed no
statistically significant differences between the three
groups in use of prescription, OTC or any medication.
Overall, the proportion of participants using any
medication ranged from 87 to 93% and mean number
of medications used ranged from 3.4 to 3.8.
Table 3 shows the association between level of
cognitive function and prescription medication use,
adjusting for other factors. There were no significant
differences among the demented, cognitively impaired
and cognitively intact groups in the relative odds of
using any prescription medications. However, the
demented group took significantly fewer prescription
medications than the cognitively impaired group.
Table 4 shows the adjusted associations between
level of cognitive function and OTC medication use.
There were significant differences among the three
groups in the relative odds of using any OTC
medications, with those who were demented or
cognitively impaired less likely to be taking such
products than the cognitively intact group, and the
demented group less likely to do so than the
cognitively impaired group. The combined group of
demented and cognitively impaired took significantly
fewer OTC medications than the cognitively intact
group.
Table 5 shows the association between use of
medications by level of cognitive function and the
most common therapeutic classes taken by the study
participants. The demented people took fewer cardio-
vascular or analgesic medications but more central
nervous system medications than either cognitively
impaired or cognitively intact people. The use of
these three therapeutic classes was examined in
multivariate analyses (Table 6). Overall, the comhined

did not differ from the cognitively intact group in use
of cardiovascular medications, analgesic medica-
tions or central nervous system agents, but the
demented subjects were less likely to be taking either
cardiovascular or analgesic medications.
Discussion
In this racially mixed sample of community-dwelling
elderly people in North Carolina, the proportion of
demented subjects using medications (87%) and the
average number of medications per person (3.4) were
substantial. This level of use was higher than that
reported previously for patients with dementia or
Alzheimer's disease [13-15]. When the demented
group were differentiated from the cognitively
impaired, demented people took significantly fewer
prescription medications than those who were cogni-
tively impaired. There are several possible explanations
for the use of fewer prescription medications by
subjects with dementia. People with dementia may
not report treatable conditions, or those conditions
may go unrecognized by clinicians or family members.
Some dementia patients may be resistant to taking
medications or more prone to adverse drug effects. For
whatever reason, they may not see a physician
regularly-an explanation supported by the signifi-
cantly higher proportion of dementia patients who did
not have a regular primary-care physician in this study.
In terms of OTC medication use, those with
dementia were Significantly less likely to take any
OTC medications and took fewer OTC medications
than those who were cognitively impaired but not
demented. Dementia may prevent patients from
performing the functional and cognitive tasks neces-
sary to obtain OTC medications, or they may have
fewer conditions that are amenable to OTC medica-
tions. Alternatively, caregivers may not be aware of
conditions treatable by OTC medications in these
patients or may be concerned about their adverse
effects. However, the underlying reason for this could
not be ascertained from the study data.
Consistent with previous studies, we found the most
frequently used therapeutic classes of medications in
demented people were, in rank order: cardiovascular,
analgesic, gastrointestinal, nutritional and central

nervous system [13, 15). Multivariate analysis revealed
that demented people were significantly less likely
than the cognitively impaired to be taking analgesics or .
cardiovascular medications. The analgesic result was
the most striking and concurs with previous studies
[14-16). It is possible that dementia patients may
underreport pain or express pain in atypical ways
and/or clinicians may undertreat pain in dementia
[37). Another interpretation is that demented partici-
pants (the majority of whom had Alzheimer's disease)
were less likely to have arthritis, a leading indication
for analgesic medications [10). Alternatively, the
higher use of analgesics by those who were not
demented may represent a protective etIect of certain
diseases or the medications used to treat them. This
explanation is consistent with a growing literature on
the protective effect of anti-inflammatory medications
on the development of Alzheimer's disease and also
with a lower than expected prevalence of Alzhei-
mer's disease in patients with rheumatoid arthritis
[9-11).
It is important to recognize potential limitations of
the study. The cross-sectional study design precluded
any conclusions about causality, making it impossible
to tell whether dementia or cognitive impairment
caused or was the result of differences in medication
use among the groups. Also, medications were
categorized into broad therapeutic classes which did
not allow for examination of individual medications
for specific indications. Misclassification of cases of
dementia or cognitive impairment is a potential
concern but the study employed well-established,
reliable, valid criteria to differentiate the groups [24,
27 - 29). Some of the cognitively impaired participants
may have underlying pathology that will eventually
lead to a diagnosis of dementia and theretore represent
graded impairment between the groups. However, at
the time of the study they did not meet standardized
criteria for dementia. The selection process from the
EPESE sample resulted in 520 partiCipants, which may
have limited our statistical power to detect significant
differences in the use of medications among the three
groups where none was found. Finally, a study of
community-dwelling elders living in the south-eastern
USA may not be representative of other populations
which may have different patterns of medication
prescribing and OTC medication use.
In conclusion, findings from this study suggest that
demented community-dwelling elderly people are less
likely to be users of OTC, analgesic and cardiovascular
medication than those who are cognitively impaired
but not demented or those who are cognitively intact.
Future research is needed to examine longitudinal
medication use patterns and the use of specific
medication classes for specific diseases in larger
samples. Such research will be useful to confirm
these results and, if they are confirmed, to determine
the appropriateness of this variation in medication use
patterns.
