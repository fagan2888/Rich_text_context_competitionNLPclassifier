OBJECTIVE: To describe physical activity (PA) and inactivity levels of Filipino youth aged 14­16 y.
DESIGN: PA type and patterns were assessed in an adolescent cohort enrolled in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition
Survey.
SUBJECTS: A total of 1053 males (aged 15.6 7 0.5 y; body mass index (BMI) ¼ 18.6 7 2.6 kg/m2) and 990 females (aged
14.6 7 0.5 y; BMI ¼ 18.8 7 2.4 kg/m2).
MEASUREMENTS: PA was assessed by (1) self-reported usual PA (questionnaire); (2) 24-h objective monitoring (Caltrac
accelerometer); and (3) 24 h recalls of PA during the objectively monitored time frame.
RESULTS: As measured by Caltrac, males expended 378.0 7 164.5 kcal and females 271.0 7 105.4 kcal. The measurement
approaches employed agreed in expected ways, given the limitations of each. Together the approaches used indicated that the
primary sources of PA for this population are chores and active commuting. In all, 40% of the sample walked to school, less than
1% rode a bicycle, 22% rode in/on motorized transport, and 37% used some combination of walking and motorized transport.
Further, gender differences exist for type, frequency, and duration of physical activities performed by Filipino youth. Specifically,
females report engaging in few leisure-time physical activities and more household chores. In total, 48% of Filipino youth report
watching !2 h/day of television; relatively few youth (7%) report watching >4 h/day at this time. An 18% of males report no
vigorous activities compared to 87% of females.
CONCLUSION: Clear gender differences in PA patterns and levels exist in Filipino adolescents. Nonsport/exercise type activities
(eg chores and active commuting) currently provide a large proportion of daily activity for both males and females, however. It is
anticipated that as modernization and technological advancement continue in this developing country, these primary sources of
PA will decrease.

Introduction
Obesity levels among adults and youth continue to grow
to epidemic proportions worldwide.1 As researchers, we
struggle to understand the roles of physical activity (PA),
inactivity, and food selection in this process. While it is
becoming clear that the shift toward greater obesity evident
in Western societies is shared with youth and adults from the
developing world, little else is understood about their unique
patterns of diet and PA.2 For example, much of what we
know about youth PA patterns is based predominantly on
the experience of developed countries, limiting our ability to
understand the roots of obesity trends in the rest of the
world.3 Decreases in PA are likely to play an important role in
the development of overweight and obesity and a range of
related health conditions, yet there is a scarcity of data on PA
patterns of youth in developing countries.4
The Philippines is one such country in the midst of a rapid
shift in diet and PA patterns that are linked with greater
obesity, hypertension, and related problems among adults.
Among Filipino youth, high blood pressure and other early
signs of cardiovascular disease (CVD) are emerging, in

particular among youth who have the lowest body mass
index (BMI) at birth, but the highest BMI in adolescence.5
Obesity has not emerged as a major problem yet among
these Filipino youth, but the BMI trends and emergence of
CVD risk factors provide a strong rationale for examining the
role of PA.
Youth is a time of transition as adolescents reprise social
roles (eg leave school, find employment) and begin to take
on more responsibilities in preparation for adulthood.
Dramatic reductions in PA during this time of transition
have been well documented in developed countries; the
steepest declines occur between the ages of 13 and 18 y and
are greater in females than in males.6 We do not know if the
same pattern holds true in developing countries; in a
country that relies on subsistence agriculture, characterized
by high levels of manual labor and low mechanization,
female adolescents working as maids in the city are more
physically active (determined by objective monitor) than
their rural counterparts charged with domestic chores and
childcare tasks.7 To better understand youth PA transition in
the context of developing countries, one strategy is to
examine thoroughly PA patterns at this important lifecycle
threshold.
No criterion standard exists to measure PA in field settings.
Self-report questionnaires are the most common method for
assessing PA in large epidemiological studies of free-living
individuals, primarily because of their low cost, ease of
administration, and potential for nonreactivity.8 PA recalls
(eg 24-h recall) and motion sensors are considered direct
measures of PA. They are not without their own biases and
limitations, however. Issues related to individual recall
ability and response bias (recall bias, social desirability bias)
are of concern for 24-h PA recalls,8 as are compliance issues
for subjects wearing motion sensors.9 Nevertheless, multiple
field measures are useful to understand overlapping and
differing aspects of PA in free-living situations. Therefore, the
purpose of this paper was to describe PA and inactivity levels
of Filipino youth aged 14­16 y using multiple methods of PA
assessment, and to assess the concordance between the
methods.
Methods
Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey
(CLHNS)
The CLHNS is a community-based study of a 1-y birth cohort
randomly selected from urban and rural communities of
Metro Cebu, the second largest and most rapidly growing
metropolitan area of the Philippines. The participants live in
diverse communities, ranging from densely populated urban
and peri-urban neighborhoods to more isolated rural villages
in the mountains or on nearby islands. Originally designed
as a study of infant feeding patterns, the CLHNS is part of an
ongoing study of a cohort of Filipino women who gave birth
between May 1, 1983 and April 30, 1984. The original sample
consisted of 3080 women having single live births. At birth,
the cohort was representative of births occurring in metro
Cebu in a 1-y period. The cohort of children born during that
period, their mothers, other caretakers, and selected siblings
continue to be followed through subsequent surveys con-
ducted in 1991­1992, 1994, and 1998­1999. A current long-
term objective of the project is to follow index children
through adolescence and into the childbearing years. In
order to shed light on the emerging trend of increased
overweight, self-report measures of index children's PA
(usual and 24-h recall) and objective monitoring of energy
expenditure as a result of PA were added to the survey in
1998­1999. Additional study details and a complete list of
publications can be found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu?pro-
jects/cebu.
Subjects
Data were collected from 1091 male and 992 female youth
14­16 y of age. All were part of the ongoing CLHNS. Teams of
trained local interviewers visited households to collect PA
data. Parents or caretakers also provided a wide range of
demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental data.
When the 1998­1999 follow-up was initiated, it was deemed
important to first collect data on all of the females, owing to
their earlier pubertal maturation compared to males.
Questionnaire data were analyzed from 1053 males (aged
15.6 7 0.5 y; BMI ¼ 18.6 7 2.6 kg/m2) and 990 females (aged
14.6 7 0.5 y; BMI ¼ 18.8 7 2.4 kg/m2), having deleted sub-
jects (38 males and two females) reporting unrealistically
high (above the 99th percentile of distribution) total
moderate (MOD) or vigorous (VIG) intensity PA levels. As a
result of the delayed data collection procedure in the
CLHNS, males were uniformly older than females (t ¼ 46.5,
Po0.0001). Males were also taller (158.5 7 6.8 vs
149.0 7 5.6 cm, t ¼ 34.3, Po0.0001) and weighed more than
females (47.1 7 8.4 vs 41.9 7 6.4 kg, t ¼ 14.6, Po0.0001).
Subjects included in the most recent CLHNS follow-up differ
in only small ways from those who were lost; initially, deaths
among the cohort of single live born subjects (n ¼ 155 in the
first 2 y) were disproportionately among poorer, less edu-
cated households. In contrast, migrants tended to be more
educated, younger, and urban. However, in several studies,
no bias in estimated relationships (eg effects of nutrition on
a health outcome) could be detected when using methods
such as Heckman modeling.
PA data
The PA questionnaire focused on MOD (3­6 metabolic
equivalents (METs)) and VIG (>6 METs) intensity PA beha-
viors at school and/or work, after school/work, and in
personal transportation. One MET is roughly equivalent to
the energy cost of sitting quietly (approximately 3.5 ml of
oxygen/kg body weight/min or 1 kcal/kg body weight/h).10
Classification of intensity levels as light (o3 METs), MOD (3­
6 METs), and VIG (>6 METs) was based on a 1993 CDC-ACSM

consensus panel on PA and public health.11 An objective
measure of energy expenditure as a result of PA was obtained
using a Caltrac accelerometer (Muscle Dynamics, Torrence,
CA, USA). The 24-h PA recall allowed for the inspection of
self-reported time use patterns.
CLHNS PA questions. Adolescents registered in school
were asked a series of questions about their usual PA
behaviors (type, frequency, duration), focusing on in-school
and after-school physical activities (exercise/sport and non-
exercise/sport), work activities, commuting mode to school,
and time spent watching television. Youth attending school
were asked to identify usual mode of commuting to school
as: (1) walking; (2) bicycling; (3) riding a motorized vehicle;
(4) a combination of 1 and 3; or (5) other. Reported time to
walk to the nearest public transportation was used to
calculate active commuting to school for youth reporting
commuting using a combination of walking and motorized
vehicle.
For respondents not registered in school, questions
focused on job type, hours/week on the job, and time spent
in physical activities after work (exercise/sport and non-
exercise/sport). Types of activities performed were recorded
verbatim and youth could volunteer as many activities as
they wished. CLHNS PA questions are included in Appendix
A. For all activities identified, respondents were queried
about their frequency (days/week) and duration (minutes or
hours/week). Frequency and duration of television watching
(hours/day) were also queried. Questions about personal
transportation were not asked of youth not registered in
school.
Caltrac accelerometer. The Caltrac accelerometer is a
small, light-weight electronic device that uses microcompu-
ter technology to assess energy expenditure as a result of PA
by monitoring vertical accelerations of the body.12,13
Caltracs were worn in a pouch attached to a waist belt,
centered over either leg. Subjects were instructed not to
remove the device, except for bathing or sleeping for
approximately 24 h, or until the interviewer returned the
next day for retrieval. Time programmed, time retrieved, and
energy expenditure as a result of PA (kcal) were recorded.
Caltracs were preprogrammed as per the manufacturer's
instructions for each individual by entering the subject's
weight, height, age, and gender into the instrument's
memory. By design, Caltrac acceleration data are converted
to energy expenditure as a result of PA by a proprietary built-
in computer program and displayed digitally as kcal.
Unfortunately, raw movement data (eg counts) were not
obtained; at the time, energy expenditure was considered the
more appropriate estimate of PA.
24-h recall. A 24-h PA recall protocol was used to identify
all PA performed while wearing the Caltrac. The adolescents
had been advised to take note of their activities while
wearing the accelerometer. The 24-h PA recall was prompted
by the trained interviewers asking about segments of the day
starting when the Caltrac was first worn and ending with its
retrieval. Youth were encouraged to account for the full time
that passed between Caltrac programming and retrieval.
Data treatment and statistical analysis
CLHNS PA questionnaire. Two researchers separately as-
signed each verbatim-reported activity a MET value using the
updated Compendium of Physical Activities.10 Discussion
and agreement resolved differences in assigned MET values.
A MET is defined as the work metabolic rate divided by the
resting metabolic rate. Active commuting to school by
walking/bicycling was classified as a MOD intensity PA.10
MET values were also assigned to represent reported intensity
of work activities. For example, work that required constant
moving and carrying light weight (eg 5 kg) was assigned a 3-
MET value.10 Frequency and duration of reported activities
were used to construct time (minutes/week) spent in MOD/
VIG physical activities. Admittedly, the energy cost of
activities is likely about 10% higher in children. Unfortu-
nately, no youth-appropriate normative data are presently
available.
Time spent in active commuting to school each week was
computed assuming 2 trips/day, 5 days/week. Inactivity
indices included no reported time in VIG activities and
watching television !2 and !4 h/day. The categories of
television watching were set to be congruent with a US study
of television watching and body composition in youth.14
Questionnaire-derived PA data tend to be positively
skewed with mean values biased by a few subjects perform-
ing a lot of PA and/or a large number of subjects performing
little or no PA.15 Therefore, descriptive data are presented for
the proportion reporting any defined PA, and the median
and interquartile range (IQR) of distribution for those
reporting any of the defined activity.
Verbatim-reported activities were further classified as
exercise/sport (eg basketball, running, dancing, etc) or
nonexercise/sport (eg fetching water, scrubbing the floor,
gardening). Median time (min/week) was determined for the
proportion of youth (by gender) reporting >0 min in each
exercise/sport classification. Gender differences in propor-
tions were tested using w2 tests; differences in time in
exercise/sport classification were tested using nonparametric
(two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum) tests.
The five most frequently reported activities for each
gender by school registration status were determined. For
subjects not registered in school but employed, the top five
most frequently reported job PA requirements were reported
for each gender. Since questioning strategies differed for
those not registered in school, statistical analysis was not
used to test differences between school registration status or
current working status.
Concordance study. Since the most complete PA question-
naire data were collected from those youth registered in
Physical activity in Filipino youth

school, the concordance study of the PA questionnaire
focused on the data obtained from this subgroup. Data were
further reduced to include only those youth wearing the
Caltrac for 22­26 h with a similar amount of time accounted
for in the 24-h recall. Reported activities for the 24-h PA
recall were assigned corresponding MET values following the
same process used for the questionnaire. Total time in MOD/
VIG activities was computed for the 24-h recalled period.
Since recalled data were positively skewed, nonparametric
tests were used to determine differences in time in recalled
PA between genders. Energy cost of 24-h recalled MOD/VIG
activities in kilocalories (kcal) was determined using indivi-
dual body weight16 and compared with Caltrac-derived kcal.
Accordingly, a 40 kg youth who recalled walking for 30 min
expended 70 kcal ((3.5 METs Â 40 kg body weight) Â (30 min/
60 min)). Descriptive data (expressed as medians with IQR)
for the 24-hr recall included the number of episodes and
summed time (minutes) recalled for the five most frequently
recalled MOD/VIG activities for each gender.
Caltrac outputs (kcal) were corrected for 24 h of observa-
tion. For example, if a subject expended 250 Caltrac-derived
kcal in 23 recorded hours of wear, then it was assumed that
24-h wear would result in 260.9 kcal of energy expenditure.
Since Caltrac data were normally distributed, descriptive
data are presented as means 7 standard deviation (s.d.).
Since operation of the Caltrac accelerometer requires input-
ting gender, age, height, and weight data, the relationship
between the Caltrac output and the normally distributed
continuous variables (in this case, height and weight) was
explored with Pearson product­moment correlation coeffi-
cients. Independent t-tests were used to determine differ-
ences in Caltrac outputs between genders. Adjusted
Spearman rank order correlations were calculated between
Caltrac PA kcal, 24-h recalled time in MOD, VIG, total MOD/
VIG activities and total kcal expended, and PA data taken
from the CLHNS questionnaire (time watching TV, time
active commuting, time in MOD/VIG activities during
school, time in MOD/VIG activities after school, and time
in total MOD/VIG activities).
Results
Table 1 presents subjects' background and household
descriptive data. Among the youth registered in school
(N ¼ 1629), 40% (341 males and 317 females) walked
to school, less than 1% (12 males and one female) rode
a bicycle, 22% (170 males and 185 females) rode
in/on motorized transport, and 37% (233 males and 367
females) used some combination of walking and motorized
transport. Three females (representing less than 1% of the
sample) reported commuting to school by some other
means.
Table 2(a) and (b) displays the five most frequently
reported activities performed during school or after school
(for those registered in school) and at work and after work
(for those not registered in school) according to the
questionnaire. Chores predominate for both genders, in
and out of school. Frequently reported physical activities
during school were of MOD intensity or higher. Males
reported marching during school whereas females reported
dancing or exercise. Both genders reported working in the
garden at school. Washing dishes (males and females),
washing clothes (males and females), and cooking (females
only) were frequently reported physical activities after
school/work that were lower than MOD intensity according
to the 2000 Compendium codes (2.3, 2.0, and 2.0 METs,
respectively).10 Males frequently reported playing basketball/
soccer after school or work. In contrast, females did not
frequently report participation in sport/exercise after school
or work. Fetching water was a frequent chore reported by all
youth on the questionnaire, but males reported pumping
water as a separate frequently performed activity.
Table 3 presents the proportion of Filipino youth regis-
tered in school engaged in any MOD/VIG activities,
specifically active commuting to school, and during and
after school activities (classified as exercise/sport or not). For
those who reported >0 min, Table 3 also displays median
time spent in these activities. Table 4 presents median time
(min/week) spent in MOD/VIG activities by Filipino youth
not registered in school, stratified by gender and current
working status. A greater proportion of employed males than
females (w2 ¼ 91.79, Po0.0001) engaged in exercise/sport
after work, with males spending significantly more time in
these activities than females (Z ¼ À3.32, P ¼ 0.001). Among
unemployed youth not attending school, a greater propor-
tion of males than females engaged in exercise/sport
activities (w2 ¼ 66.63, Po0.001; test for gender differences
in time in PA Z ¼ À1.24, P ¼ 0.21). There was no gender

Table 5 shows the proportion of Filipino youth meeting
select inactivity indices. There were no differences in the
proportion of males or females reporting watching television
! 2 h/day (w2 ¼ 0.36, P ¼ 0.55). Relatively more females
reported watching television !4 h/day than males
(w2 ¼ 15.2, Po0.0001). The proportion of females reporting
no VIG PA was significantly higher for males (w2 ¼ 817.89,
Po0.0001).
Concordance study
Data that met the inclusion criteria (22­26 h of wearing the
Caltrac concurrent with the 24-h recall for PA) were available
for 715 males and 831 females registered in school.
Caltrac accelerometer
The mean values for 24-h corrected Caltrac PA kcal were
378.0 7 164.5 kcal for males and 271.0 7 105.4 kcal for
females (difference between gender, t ¼ 15.0, Po0.0001). As
expected, the Caltrac-derived energy expenditure as a result
of PA was correlated (Pearson product moment) with height
(r ¼ 0.35, Po0.0001) and weight (r ¼ 0.50, Po0.0001) for the
whole sample. Spearman rank order correlation between
Caltrac PA kcal and age was also significant (r ¼ 0.28,
Po0.0001).
24-h recall
Almost all (704, or 98%) of the males in the concordance
study sample recalled engaging in MOD/VIG activities
over the same time period that the Caltrac was worn;
the median minutes of MOD/VIG activities was 118 (IQR ¼
68­194). A similar proportion of females (817, or 98%)
recalled 95 (IQR ¼ 50­153) min of MOD/VIG activities. The
difference between genders in median recalled time was
significant (Z ¼ 5.31, Po0.0001). Expressed as kcal owing to
MOD/VIG activities, males expended a median of 387
(IQR ¼ 201­691) kcal and females expended 240 (IQR ¼
128­409) kcal.
The five most frequently reported MOD/VIG activities in
the 24-h recall, by gender, are presented in Table 6. The
number of discrete episodes of PA performed and total time
spent in PA over the 24-h recalled period is also presented. In
the concordance study sample, 615 (86%) males reported a
median of 2 (IQR ¼ 1­3) episodes of television watching
totaling 2.3 (IQR ¼ 1.3­3.6) h/day and 644 (77%) females
reported a median of 2 (IQR ¼ 1­3) episodes of television
watching totaling 1.8 (IQR ¼ 1.0­2.8) h/day. Median time
reported watching television differed significantly between
genders (Z ¼ 4.85, Po0.0001).
Concordance
Spearman rank order correlations between self-reported data
(24-h recall and CHLNS questionnaire) and the Caltrac PA
kcals were adjusted for height and weight and computed
separately for each gender. Additional adjustment for age

was not necessary since age differed uniformly between
genders. In males, Caltrac PA kcal correlated at Po0.0001
with all 24-h recall variables: minutes in MOD PA (r ¼ 0.36),
minutes in VIG PA (r ¼ 0.35), minutes in MOD/VIG activities
(r ¼ 0.51), and computed kcal for recalled time in MOD/VIG
activities (r ¼ 0.55). Similar relationships were observed in
females (r ¼ 0.39, 0.14, 0.41, 0.43, respectively), all signifi-
cant at Po0.0001.
Spearman rank order correlation matrices of direct (Caltrac
and 24-hour PA recall) and indirect measures (CHLNS
questionnaire variables) by gender are presented in Table 7.
In both genders, Caltrac PA kcal was inversely correlated
with time reported watching television and positively
correlated with time reported spent active commuting, in
after-school MOD/VIG activities, and in total MOD/VIG
activities.
Discussion
The most frequently reported physical activities according
to both the PA questionnaire and the 24-h recall were
chores, both during and after school. Activities related to
classroom maintenance (sweeping, scrubbing, cleaning)
were most frequently reported for both genders during
school. Otherwise, males marched while females danced or
exercised within school time. Both genders also reported
working in the school garden, a feature of the Filipino school
curriculum. After school/work, domestic duties predomi-
nated for both genders. These findings are consistent with
other reports of developing countries where children and
youth are regularly engaged in domestic tasks, especially
females.7 Only males reported frequent participation after
school in sport/exercise (specifically basketball and soccer).

participated in exercise/sport activities both during and after
school.
A total of 51% of the total Filipino sample reported no VIG
activities. This is compared with 36% of US high school
students (grades 9­12) responding to the 1997 Youth Risk
Behaviour Surveillance System (YRBSS).17 The YRBSS focuses
on participation in sport/exercise activities and includes a
single question querying frequency of walking/bicycle riding
at least 30 min at a time. No questions address occupation,
errand, or chore-related activities. Discrepancies in preva-
lence estimates between these two countries may be
attributed to measurement bias; leisure-time physical activ-
ities (ie sport and exercise), as we understand them in a
Western context, are not common in developing countries.7
A similarly constructed instrument (as the YRBSS) was used
to survey Singapore youth about PA behaviors; prevalence
estimates were not reported.18 If youth PA patterns in the
developing country of Singapore are similar to those of
Filipino youth, then an instrument focusing primarily on
sports and exercise would be inappropriate. The current
study indicates that this conclusion is more valid for
adolescent females than males. This point is consistent with
a study of West African adolescent females that reported
leisure-time/personal activities consisted of a shower, hob-
bies, eating, resting, and social activities but not sport or
exercise.7
Filipino males reported watching television a median of
2.3 h/day, significantly greater than the 1.8 h/day reported
by females. In comparison, Singapore youth engage in 2­4 h
of multimedia usage daily (combined television, video, or
computer) with equal viewing time patterns between males
and females.18 In the US, 67% of youth 8­16 years of age
reported watching television !2 h/day;14 48% of Filipino
youth watch television !2 h/day. Relatively few (7%) Filipino
youth (with the exception of females not currently registered
in school or working) watch very high levels of daily
television, defined as !4 h/day. Comparatively, 26% of US
youth watched !4 h/day of television.14 Differences in
measurement approaches used in studying these different
countries make more direct comparisons difficult. Apparent
differences may also reflect television programming rele-
vance and appeal or cultural differences in viewing habits.
For example, within Filipino communities, television own-
ership is not a prerequisite for television watching as people
may gather at the home of whoever has a television.
Regardless, such high levels of inactive leisure pursuits are
of concern. In the US, children who watch !4 h/day of
television have a greater BMI and greater body fat than
children who watch less than 2 h/day.14 It will be important
to follow international trends in PA and obesity, as television
ownership peaks and relevant and appealing programming
increases over time.
Caltrac-derived energy expenditure as a result of PA was
largely modulated by gender, weight, and height in this
relatively homogenous sample with respect to age. This
finding is consistent with the results of a doubly labeled
water study in an ethnically diverse sample that included
youth from Guatemala;19 energy expenditure attributed
solely to PA in that study was positively related to weight,
and both fat and fat-free mass. A review of several cross-
sectional studies20 emphasizes that obese children are less
physically active compared to nonobese peers, but that a
difference in total energy expenditure is less apparent owing
to confounding by body weight. Since energy expenditure is
not synonymous with PA,21,22 validation in this study
reflects concordance between measures of different con-
structs with overlapping or shared dimensions. Relationships
between the various methods of PA assessment used were
statistically significant and in the expected direction,
lending confidence to the validity of the questionnaire used.
The primary caveat to interpretation is that correlation is
affected by sample size; with very large samples small
correlation coefficients will be statistically significant.
Interestingly, walking was the most frequently reported PA
according to the 24-h recall, but not on the questionnaire.
This discrepancy is likely because of the perceived salience of
walking activities relative to the time frame questioned. The
24-h recall asked youth to list details of every PA (physical or
not) engaged in over 1 day in recent memory. For example, if
a respondent indicated that s/he ``walked to fetch water and
pumped it,'' three separate physical activities would be
coded (walk, fetch water, pump water). In contrast, the
questionnaire asked what types of physical activities were
typically performed over a usual week. Thus, implicit in
fetching water was walking and pumping. Walking was not
specifically queried on the questionnaire other than with
regard to active commuting to school. Regardless, walking
(in all its forms) is considered the least reliably recalled
PA assessed by self-report.23­25 This is another example of
the potential benefit of combining objective monitoring
devices that are sensitive to walking with self-report methods
of PA. PA data may be better interpreted from both
perspectives.
It is anticipated that as modernization and technological
advancement continue in this developing country, the
primary sources of PA (chores and active commuting) will
decrease. Unless there is a concomitant increase in leisure-
time activities, a rise in the prevalence of obesity is expected.
Halting modernization is not a likely option for prevention.
More viable approaches include implementing policies that
facilitate a healthy amount of daily incidental PA (eg public
transportation policies, walkable communities, car taxes) in
addition to promoting attractive active leisure-time alter-
natives (eg community and cultural events, school physical
education, parks and greenspaces). Such strategies may be of
most importance to Filipino females who currently partici-
pate in relatively few active leisure-time activities.
In summary, assessed using a multi-method approach and
consistent with international understanding,26 gender
differences exist for type, frequency, and duration of physical
activities performed by Filipino youth. The primary sources
of PA for this population are chores and active commuting.

These types of activities are likely to decrease as moderniza-
tion continues. The impact of changes in youth PA patterns
and relevant health outcomes will continue to be studied
longitudinally in this developing country as attempts are
made to understand how these PA patterns change with the
transition to adulthood and how they relate to obesity and
other health problems.
