Introduction
The role of social interaction and dialogue is highlighted
in our modern-day information-, service-, and expertise-
oriented society. Since the 1990s, it has been broadly recog-
nized that knowledge and expertise create the basis for com-
petitiveness in most organizations (Camargo-Borges &
Rasera, 2013; Tsoukas, 2009; Yankelovich, 2001). Similar to
the private sector, the public sector is also facing the need for
extensive structural changes, and due to the changes in the
operational environment, there are major economic and
political pressures putting emphasis on achieving better effi-
ciency. The concept of New Public Management was intro-
duced with the aim of improving quality, increasing customer
orientation and customer satisfaction, reducing administra-
tive costs, and increasing cost-effectiveness and productivity
as a whole (Skålén, 2004).
In this article, we examine how a state of common under-
standing evolves via reciprocal dialogue in one public sector
organization that went through a merger 1 year prior to this
study. The organization operates under the Ministry of
Economy and the Employment and consists of three, previ-
ously separate, governmental offices with different areas of
expertise (employment and economy, transport, and environ-
ment). The head of the organization arranged a development
project where the personnel and management could share
their views and discuss the current situation. This process
provided an opportunity for members of the organization and
researchers to reflect on the merger of the organization
together. For managers, it also meant that they exposed
themselves to critique from the workers.
In this article, our focus is on the process of constructing
the identity of an organization. According to Foreman and
Whetten (2002), organizational identity has become an
established means of analyzing several aspects of an organi-
zation. The momentum to study organizational identity also
stems from the rediscovery of the relevance of meaning and
emotion in organizational life (Albert, Ashforth, & Dutton,
2000) that is particularly relevant in the times of fundamental
organizational change such as a merger.
Instead of discussing the organization's change, culture, or
management in depth (Taskinen, 2011), we concentrate on
analyzing the interactive processes of the organization, such as
dialogue. For example, Scott and Lane (2000) argue that orga-
nizational identity emerges "from complex, dynamic, and
reciprocal interactions among managers, organizational mem-
bers, and other stakeholders" (p. 44). According to Corley and

From Disunited to Joint Action:
Dialogue Reflecting the Construction of
Organizational Identity After a Merger
Kaarina Mönkkönen1 and Anu Puusa2
Abstract
Inter-organizational collaboration can be understood as a product of sets of conversations that draw on existing discourses.
This article examines one public organization going through a fundamental organizational change. We describe the process
of construction of organizational identity after a merger by using a model describing identified forms of interaction: (a)
formally together, (b) unidirectional interaction, (c) juxtapositions, (d) construction of commonality, and (e) the state of
joint action. There is a link between the construction of a more collectively interpreted identity and the way in which people
communicate, create relationships, and network. This article highlights the relevance and meaning of conscious identity work
in the process: The management's ability and willingness to create forums for dialogue and social interaction creates potential
for construction of a collectively interpreted organizational identity and promotes cooperation and collaboration.

Gioia (2004), identity ambiguity occurs during organizational
change: Organizational members are uncertain about what the
organization stands for and where it is going. In other words,
identity ambiguity implies multiple possible interpretations
about which fundamental and core features should define the
changed organization. As members cope with and try to man-
age the sense of ambiguity, they create meanings for the iden-
tity from the events, actions, and discussions within the
organization, regarding what the organization is becoming,
and this is reflected in their speech (Corley & Gioia, 2004).
Thus, by using empirical data, we describe how members of
the organization move from the separate groups and disunited
practices reflected in their speech toward joint action and a
more collective interpretation of their organizational identity.
We ask, "How does dialogic speech evolve during the research
process and how does speech reflect the construction of orga-
nizational identity?"
The theoretical viewpoint of this article is based on theo-
ries of organizational identity and professional interaction.
The latter manifests itself in various ways that can be classi-
fied as different forms of interaction. Through our chosen
conceptual framework, we want to clarify the role and sig-
nificance of collaboration and examine dialogical interaction
as a means of communication and relationship building, to
outline its connection to the construction of organizational
identity. The roots of the notion of a collective identity of an
organization are based mainly in the theories of James
Cooley, George. H. Mead, and Erving Goffman, on the theme
of social identity (see Albert & Whetten, 1985). According to
social identity theory, people have "a natural tendency" to
categorize themselves and others into different categories,
such as organizational membership, to help them define oth-
ers in a somewhat systematic manner. This results in having
to face issues such as individual autonomy, dependence,
identity and belonging, and connection (Gergen, 2009).
Identity and community present focal points of inquiry for
social scientists interested in how we express ourselves and
connect with others. Simultaneously, social classification
also helps the individual locate or define himself or herself in
the social environment where he or she operates (Ashforth &
Mael, 1989). We argue that this tendency becomes particular
noticeable in times of change.
Identity of an Organization
There are a very limited number of studies where the con-
struction of identity would have been studied from a dia-
logue and discourse perspective. However, Hardy, Lawrence,
and Grant (2005), who studied the relationship between dis-
course and inter-organizational collaboration, argue that
inter-organizational collaboration can be understood as the
product of sets of conversations that draw on existing dis-
courses. While it is our understanding that it is not always
possible or even desirable to achieve interpretations that are
even somewhat similar across the organization, during major
organizational changes, an organization can benefit from
active, conscious identity work.
Identity stories can be regarded as narratives that are con-
structed to provide meaning and closure to different phases
in organizational life (Ashforth & Mael, 1996). This notion
is also supported by Albert and Whetten (1985) who argue
that "normally" organizational identity seems latent, but
when an organization faces a substantial need for change--
such as during a merger--dimensions of organizational iden-
tity will become salient. Ashforth and Mael (1996) also point
out that organizational identity is most likely to be explicitly
discussed during, for example, major changes. According to
Chreim (2007), the mainstream of studies dealing with merg-
ers has focused on financial implications, adopting a mana-
gerial orientation, and emphasizing strategic decisions and
undertakings. He continues, stating that studies have given
much less attention to interpretive activities during mergers.
One of the aims of an organizational merger is to promote
collaboration and find synergies. Therefore, at a practical
level, the topic is relevant, as Hardy et al. (2005) argue, col-
laboration has the potential to produce powerful results, and
collective identity is critically important in achieving effec-
tive collaboration. They elaborate that discursive conceptu-
alization of collective identity helps significantly in
facilitating understanding of the dynamics of collaboration,
because it situates collective identity in the language in use
in the organization. Hardy et al. (2005) continue by arguing
that this approach shifts attention from the intentions and
attitudes of individuals to their observable linguistic prac-
tices and the effects of those practices on social relationships
and action. However, it is difficult to conceptualize and eval-
uate the mode of interaction needed and desired in a new
situation. According to Chreim (2007), sense-making pro-
cesses evolve in the organizational context, and their role is
particularly highlighted during the processes of organiza-
tional change. How the members of an organization interpret
issues related to change affects their commitment and their
involvement in the merger process (see Puusa, 2009) and
reflects in the way organizational members speak about the
organization.
From the narrative point of view, the identity of an orga-
nization is constructed in different groups and different con-
texts (Brown, Humphreys, & Gurney, 2005; Hatch & Schultz,
2002) and it is affected by time, social interaction, and inter-
pretations and reinterpretations by different parties. So, by
nature it is complex, social, and changes with time. In orga-
nization studies, collective identity was predominantly first
introduced by Albert and Whetten in 1985. According to
them, identity in an organizational context can be understood
by analyzing the characteristics the members of the organiza-
tion perceive as central, distinctive, and enduring when the
past, present, and future are taken into account (Albert &
Whetten, 1985). The way these convergent beliefs are inter-
preted affects the way members feel and behave within the
organization.
Mönkkönen and Puusa 3
According to Scott and Lane (2000), organizational iden-
tity is dynamic, reciprocal, and interactive in nature. An
emotional element describing the intensity of how strongly
people believe in the unique and distinctive nature of their
organization has also been identified as a characteristic of the
organizational identity (Puusa, Kuittinen, & Kuusela, 2013).
Like many other researchers, we believe that identity of
an organization is a socially constructed, intersubjective phe-
nomenon. According to Ashforth and Mael (1996), organiza-
tional identity exists to the extent that people believe it does.
They elaborate that while identity can be regarded as a
socially constructed, intersubjective phenomenon, "the
greater the consensus among organizational members regard-
ing the perceiver organizational identity is, and the more
confident are the members of the veracity of their percep-
tions, the stronger an organizational identity is said to be"
(Ashforth & Mael, 1996, p. 23).
However, at the beginning, the functionalist perspective
dominated the conceptualization and research of organiza-
tional identity (Gioia, 1998), and identity research only took
into account the perspective of the management. The basic
assumption was that the members of the organization act
consistently in relation to the organization's identity.
However, little by little, the perspective altered, and cur-
rently, organizational identity is most often conceived as a
shifting, process-like, discursively formed phenomenon
(Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003; Puusa et al., 2013). Brown
and Humphreys (2002) consider narratives to be the fore-
most means of working fragmented experiences into a com-
prehensible and coherent form. Discourses are then used as
the main instruments of identity construction, and personnel
can either adapt to or oppose, to differing degrees, the
demands of their organization (Kuhn, 2006). According to
Hardy et al. (2005), from a discursive perspective, a collec-
tive identity exists as a discursive object produced in and
through conversations. In other words, organization mem-
bers collectively engage in the discursive practices that pro-
duce and reproduce a meaningful identity for the group in
question (Hardy et al., 2005). Albert (1998) suggests that
identity cannot be measured with all the connotations of
measurement. Instead, identity at both an individual and
organizational level may be the last refuge of the qualitative
in a world of invading armies wielding rulers and compasses.
An identity may express a need for uniqueness and privacy:
"It honors the ineffable" (Albert, 1998, p. 3).
The vast majority of researchers have adopted the view
that organizational identity as a phenomenon has a collective
nature. Organizational identity refers to the answers to the
questions of "who are we really as an organization" or "who
do we want to be" (Albert & Whetten, 1985; Corley & Gioia,
2004; Whetten, 2006; Whetten, Foreman, & Dyer, 2012).
According toAshforth and Mael (1996), "the quest to answer
`Who are we?,' is a quest for the soul of the organization, for
meaning and justification" (p. 29). Similarly, it is our prem-
ise that identity is a negotiated, interactional accomplishment
that can, but not necessarily will, be a construct of collective
meanings and interpretations. Identity, therefore, is a volatile
social construction that bases its existence and significance
largely on the interpretative preferences of an organization's
members, who both shape and are shaped by their organiza-
tional membership through this dynamic dialectic process.
The notion of holographic identity describes a situation
where there are a considerable number of shared interpreta-
tions and a significant degree of collective understanding of
organizational identity across the organization (Albert &
Whetten, 1985; Whetten et al., 2012). In ideographic organi-
zations, in turn, individuals display subunit-specific identi-
ties (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). While the meaning and
implications of it remain unresolved, the idea of multiple
identity organizations has been presented by numerous orga-
nizational identity researchers (Albert & Whetten, 1985;
Ashforth & Mael, 1996; Pratt & Foreman, 2000; Scott &
Lane, 2000). Thus, as is typical for individuals, organiza-
tions, particularly developing organizations, can also acquire
multiple identities (Albert & Whetten, 1985). Therefore,
Ashforth and Mael (1996) argue that organizations are per-
petually in "the process of becoming, occasionally in an
uneven state of it" (p. 26).
As Bakhtin (1978) wrote, people create their notion of
truth together with others via communication and social
interaction processes where our experiences, new thoughts,
and emotions are filtered through our surroundings. In addi-
tion, Shotter (1993) has argued that identity should not be
dealt only as an individual information processing system
without understanding its social context. This idea is high-
lighted in the concept of dialogue: In an organizational con-
text, it emphasizes the relevance and meaning of reciprocal,
multivoiced interaction. According to Nonaka, Toyama, and
Konno (2000), there is still very little understanding of how
organizations actually create and manage knowledge dynam-
ically, or how the processes of constructing a shared under-
standinginregardtoanorganization'sdefiningcharacteristics
take place and evolve (Jabri, 2004; Puusa, 2009; Risberg,
Tienari, & Vaara, 2003).
Five Forms of Organizational Discourse
The dialogical aspect of workplace communication and man-
agement and the capacity for dialogical interaction are
increasingly perceived to be important parts of work compe-
tence in the future (Haslam, Reicher, & Platow, 2010; Isaacs,
1999). Dialogical interaction can be seen from two points of
view: first, as a means of communication and a way to build
common understanding with each other, and second, as a
meansofbuildingcollaborationandrapport(seeAvtonomova,
1999; McNamee & Gergen, 1999; Mönkkönen, 2002, 2008;
Johnson & Johnson, 2012).
Sociologist Carl J. Couch's (1986) theory of cooperative
action is based on five elements of interaction, "acknowledged
attentiveness, mutual responsiveness, congruent functional
4 SAGE Open
identities, shared focus and social objective" (pp. 116-119),
when focusing on behavior in small-group situations.
Mönkkönen (2002, 2008) has reinterpreted and refined
Couch's theory in the context of working community places
and client work, and renamed these elements the five hierar-
chical forms of interaction: presence in situation, social influ-
ence, game, cooperation, and collaboration. However, these
forms should not be seen as fixed and permanent but as inter-
actions that involve movement in different forms, and from
time to time, some discourse may be more dominant than oth-
ers (see Marková & Gillespie, 2007). As presented in this
article, we have analyzed our data by using a modification of
the forms presented by the first author and argue that in an
organizational context, reaching "cooperation and collabora-
tion" can be regarded as desirable and as an indicator of a form
in which the construction of a more collectively shared under-
standing of identity has been reached through the process of
dialogue.
In the first form, presence in the situation, people acknowl-
edge the presence of others but have little to no contact with
each other. People behave very formally, and do not share
things or tasks with one another. This reflects a kind of cul-
ture where people work individually, groups work in sepa-
rate silos, tasks are not shared with others, and a common
goal is missing. In group theories, this form is not seen as
group work at all. Individuals focus on their own tasks, rather
thanontheissuesofthegrouportheorganization(Engeström,
1992; Johnson & Johnson, 2012).
The second form is one-sided social influence. In this
form, interaction can be unidirectional when one participant
has power over a group or another individual in an interac-
tion (Bakhtin & Emerson, 1993; Shotter, 1993). For exam-
ple, the group leader determines the dynamics of the
interaction while the others have the role of follower. In such
a case, the communication is asymmetrical and the element
of power is obvious, creating room for the element of unpre-
dictability. According to Couch (1986), in power interac-
tions, asymmetry occurs when the opinions of the others are
only "counted" in. The relevance of good interaction and
participation are recognized and dealt with in official dis-
course, but in reality, internal control and unidirectional
interaction are what exist (Engeström, 1992; Tsoukas, 2009).
Couch (1986) also brings up the fact that in a power relation-
ship, there is an element of unpredictability, because the ele-
ment of asymmetry of power is obvious. In the organizational
context, strong critique of the traditional management of the
organization is reflected in this form as well.
The third form of interaction is termed game. In this form,
rivalry between people or teams is apparent. The participants
do not have a shared focus, they compete for resources, and
consequently, the idea of common organization does not
exist or is lost (see Couch, 1986). Members of an organiza-
tion may share a common goal, but they do not collaborate in
achieving it. Instead, each party focuses on winning the game
(Maxwell, 2002). In the context of organizational change,
this can be detected in the form of different kinds of tensions,
such as defense and frustration, and working in isolated silos
(Yankelovich, 2001). Competition is often evident in the
early phases of an organizational fusion process when a per-
son's role in the bigger corporation cannot yet be identified.
The fourth form of interaction, cooperation, differs from
the previous ones due to its inclusion of shared focus and tar-
gets, which are achieved through mutual contracts between
workers. In this form, the role of control is to ensure that the
goals are achieved. This form has been described as team
work, group work, or with the definitions of cooperation in
general (Leonard, Graham, & Bonacum., 2004). This cannot
yet be classed as collaboration because trust and common
innovations are still lacking (Isaacs, 1999; Tsoukas, 2009;
Yankelovich, 2001). According to Engeström (1992), in coop-
eration, challenges and targets are shared, and the workers,
instead of promoting their own interests, start to share ideas
and thoughts, as well as produce solutions to common prob-
lems. This approach has also been used to describe multidisci-
plinarity and multiprofessionality (Mikkeli & Pakkasvirta,
2007). Multidisciplinarity gathers different disciplines
together, and research focuses on the same theme. However,
the disciplines still operate as traditional, separate disciplines.
Interdisciplinarity, in turn, assimilates different perspectives
and creates totally new approaches.
Finally, we argue that cooperation is a phenomenon that
has antecedents that can be very ambiguous, complex, and
abstract by nature. It is thus recognized that cooperation
among participants, such as organizational members, cannot
be secured, for example, through hierarchical authority or
forms of control. Instead, it is dependent on the relationships
among participating members. The relationships, in turn, are
being negotiated on an ongoing basis throughout the life of
the collaboration (Hardy et al., 2005).
The fifth form is collaboration. There are a variety of defi-
nitions for collaboration and thus among researchers there is
little agreement as to how the concept should be defined
(Hardy et al., 2005). In this article, the collaboration stage is
associated with confidence, which diminishes the need for
control. The discourse within the organization in general is
also more future oriented. At this level, there is trust and
commitment between workers, and every member of the
team contributes to the overall whole (see Engeström, 1992;
Johnson & Johnson, 2012; Maxwell, 2002). These aspects
are outlined generally in a productive team-building process
with a common task, cooperation, and team spirit, thus com-
bining team productivity with personal productivity (see
Johnson & Johnson, 2012). In the organizational context, we
look at these points only in terms of how the informants
describe their relationship with others. In this form, interac-
tion is based on a genuine dialogue.
The term dialogue originates from words "dia" and
"logos," and their combination is described as "joint accu-
mulation of the world." The theoretical background of dia-
logue research is based on the work of Mikhail Bhakti and
Mönkkönen and Puusa 5
Lev Vygotsky. All researchers of dialogue share a view of
intersubjectivity in human life and social interaction (e.g.,
Jabri, 2004; Shotter, 1993). Dialogue is a trust-building pro-
cess with the aim of advancing collective understanding
among an organization's members (Puusa, Mönkkönen, &
Hytti, 2014; Yankelovich, 2001). In this article, we will not
be delving more deeply into the theoretical base of dialogue;
instead, we will only be discussing it in regard to its role as
an important part of collaboration.
In Table 1, we outline the interconnectedness of organiza-
tional identity and elements of interaction. In the section that
follows, we take our theoretical analysis further using the
empirical data.
Method and Data
This is a qualitative case study in which the aim is to under-
stand the target phenomenon by analyzing textual data
(Brown et al., 2005; Flick, 2014; Yin, 2003). The method-
ological and therefore epistemological choices are premised
on social constructionism, which emphasizes the idea that
the social world is a subjective construction created by indi-
viduals who, through the use of language and interactions,
are able to create and sustain a social world of shared mean-
ing (Harré & Van Langenhove, 1998; Shotter, 1993). Due to
rapid transformations in work environments, social con-
structionism is a useful approach to investigate change in
organizations. There have also been ethical implications that
have caused a move away from expert-based, hierarchical,
and result-focused studies, to more participatory, co-cre-
ative, and process-centered ones (Camargo-Borges &
Rasera, 2013).
Billig et al. (1988) have criticized studies that attempt to
simplify people's argumentation into a measurable attitude
or an opinion, ignoring the context of the argumentation and
looking only for universal patterns of thinking. There are
many social phenomena that cannot be turned into statistical
measures (Marková & Gillespie, 2007), in addition to which,
organizations are very complex and phenomena should be
seen more as "wicked" problems than "tame" problems,
which are easily resolved after diagnosis (Rittel & Webber,
1973). Following the logic argued by Hardy et al. (2005),
dialogue- and discourse-oriented studies of organizational
identity focus on the processes through which a collective
identity is produced via the creation of texts. The attention is
focused on the constructive effects of conversations in which
participants describe themselves as a collective. Therefore,
we identified collectively shared discourses (if and when
they appeared) in the data to describe the section regarding
construction of organizational identity. Because organiza-
tions are polyphonic, the description and analysis of evolv-
ing narratives is relevant. We chose a narrative approach; the
research departs from the notion that through free argumen-
tation, the participants fumble their way toward an attitude
(Boje, 2001; Creswell, 2013). A narrative approach can be
broadly regarded as a way of knowing, a nature of knowl-
edge, research data, analysis of data, or the practical meaning
of research (Polkinghorne, 1995).
The data were gathered during a 1-year process, and the
textual data were gathered five times during the year. Initially,
we asked the participants to describe their experience of the
previous organization (before the merger). After the analysis,
we arranged the first joint seminar where the analysis was
presented and then discussed openly. The dialogues between
us as researchers and the participants were recorded and later
used as a basis for the subsequent data collections. After the
first stage, we collected four more sets of data and organized
five seminars in between the data collections. The questions
included themes on topics such as "who we are as an organi-
zation" and "where are we going." Altogether, during 1 year,
we analyzed 1,120 short texts written by the total of 224
organization members. The total number of employees was
190, and 24 to 70 individuals answered open-ended enquiries
during each of the five phases of the research process. For
qualitative study, the data are sufficiently comprehensive.
The respondents were professionals, managers, and adminis-
trative personnel. On the basis of these free-form written
comments, we examined how a merger is discussed in gen-
eral terms. After this, we itemized the sections in the com-
ments where various interactions appear, after which the

extracts were classified according to various forms of inter-
action. Due to the long process, combined with the participa-
tory element, the research process featured many elements
traditionally linked to action research (Graumann, 1992;
Greenwood & Lewin, 1998).
When the identity of an organization is just forming,
defense of one's own territory and maintenance of differ-
ent (structural or imaginary) borders are apparent, but as
the process proceeds, the borders become less relevant and
the sense of a mutual organization starts to dominate (see
Puusa & Kekäle, 2013). According to Billig (1991), this
could be seen as a natural part of constructing identity and
argumentation. Common sense provides the individual
with the seeds for contrary themes, which can conflict in
dilemmatic situations. Based on this, we wanted to deal
with the data as constructive, unfinished argumentation
about their organization. Using textual analysis, we have
outlined the construction process for collective identity
through the five forms of interaction (Mönkkönen 2002,
2008), introduced previously.
In the following section, we describe how interaction with
others is constructed just after the merger and how it evolves
in time. We analyze, as previously framed by the first author,
how the different forms of interaction--(a) formally together,
(b) unidirectional interaction, (c) juxtapositions, (d) con-
struction of commonality, and (e) state of joint action--are
present in our data. Although these forms of interaction are
described as linear steps, it is important to note that all forms
of interaction were partly present throughout the whole pro-
cess of the merger, due to the individual differences of the
research participants.
The quotes are marked with the letter E, referring to an
employee, or the letter M, referring to a manager.
Results
Forms of Interaction
Formally together. It was very apparent in our data that all the
members who used to belong to different, "old" offices felt
that communality and solidarity used to be better there. They
also felt more satisfied with the management previously, and
felt that the managers and employees used to be more tightly
connected to one another. This was seen, for example, in the
following ways:
The organization where we were before was an open
community in which people shared common knowledge about
what was going on. The meaning of the work was clear, and
our work was respected. Administration was fluent, the unity
of the organization was apparent without distinction between
"us" and "them." (E)
Our old organization was not as bureaucratic a community as the
current one is, and there was an atmosphere where everyone
had the opportunity to participate, and real democracy was
implemented. It was a team-based organization with a low
degree of hierarchy. (E)
The managers also had positive feelings on the previous
organization. One manager, for example, stated that "the
mission was clear and employees were motivated . . . now
the future perspectives are much more unclear." The com-
parisons with the new, current entity were presented in a very
black and white manner: The old organization was perceived
very positively whereas the new organization as a whole
aroused confusion and suspicion. This phenomenon has been
identified in prior studies: The past is seen in a romantic
light. For example, Bakhtin (1978) wrote that the past is usu-
ally seen as a paradise where life was much easier and more
natural; people feel the need to hang on to the past and pro-
tect the interests they feel might be under threat. The actual
challenge is whether an organization is able to overcome this
stage and direct efforts toward accepting and building a new
organization.
According to the data, the members of the organization
collectively felt a lack of common goals. This was due to not
knowing others and the work they do. The new organization
consisted of two previously separate offices with different
areas of expertise; therefore, the connection between both
issues and people was interpreted as being very shallow and
formal. This became evident when analyzing comments that
stated how members of the different units questioned the
need for the organizational merger in the first place and
regarded the new entity as artificial. There was "no common
ground," and the large physical distance between offices pre-
served that perception. A feeling of separation and being in
their own silos, as well as a lack of a common goal were
dominant in discourse at the beginning of the process.
We hardly know each other and what kind work is being done in
the other offices . . . we have not been introduced to other people
or the work they do. (E)
We still potter about in our own "foxholes." Common interfaces
have been sought in the area of substance, but none have been
found as far I understand . . . we have conflicting goals . . . What
is the common target then? (M)
It's no use putting tasks together by force . . . I wouldn't put all
tasks in the same category. Flexibility is necessary from
managers as well, not only workers. (E)
This stage as a whole was characterized by many juxtapo-
sitions between teams, units, and professional areas, as well
as between the management and personnel, with a belief that
what occurred was inevitable and could be explained by the
organizational merger. Ashforth and Mael (1989) have
argued that the salience, stability, and internal consistency of
identity affect the internalization of it. According to our
interpretation, organizational identity at this point was very
fragmented (Sveningsson & Alvesson, 2003). At the same
Mönkkönen and Puusa 7
time, the personnel highlighted that a common organization
can be created only when people get to know each other,
understand and value what others do, and give up maintain-
ing artificial boundaries based on prejudice and the old
organizations.
Unidirectional interaction. In particular, at the beginning of the
research process, the texts included a lot of critique toward
the management and their "traditional management style."
The critique by the managers in turn was targeted to top man-
agement and the steering ministry. The amount and quality of
administrative regulations were seen as a problem.
In the process of building a new organization, a lot of
communication and different arenas for communication are
needed. However, the organization members perceived col-
lective meetings as a means for the management to give one-
way information about current issues. The meetings were
interpreted as having failed somewhat in making sense of the
organizational merger, or creating trust between personnel
and management or between different units. On the contrary,
feelings of mistrust and control seemed to strengthen:
There's a feeling that we are all doing our work without
responsibility and there are many methods being used to control
the personnel. (E)
We employees are afraid of making any decisions without the
approval from our superiors nowadays. They announced to us
that the change was taking place but we are the ones left carrying
it through. Discussions with my superior are one-sided
monologues where he sets the boundaries and timetables in a
very authoritarian manner. There is no trust! (E)
All throughout the research process, there was criticism
directed toward the traditional, control-based management
style, which was also interpreted as a typical characteristic of
public sector management. In addition to this, the partici-
pants felt that a constant reduction of resources while inten-
sifying demands and expectations in terms of performance
resulted in passivity, leading to a situation where workers
only did the bare minimum. This was described, for example,
in the following ways:
It's micro-managing, small details are the focus, minor issues
are being controlled. (E)
There are times when the demands and expectations from the
management seem very unreasonable--Sometimes I feel like
I'm in an army. (E)
Don't keep the leash too tight . . . otherwise the workers do only
the minimum. (E)
Along with the increasing element of control, the partici-
pants also felt that bureaucracy had increased. This discus-
sion was interestingly dilemmatic (Billig et al., 1988). On
one hand, top­down steering from management was criti-
cized, while on the other hand, the need for common rules
was accepted, as it was perceived as ensuring fairness and
equity:
The number of new rules and regulations became overwhelming.
In principle it is fine to have common rules, but no one can
really read all of them. (E)
Why on earth should the bureaucracy be decreased? If
bureaucracy means instructions and regulation, it can only be
positive. It is good that someone has thought through the
procedures already, if they are obeyed the chances of making
mistakes are decreased. (M)
At the organizational level, there was no clear, common
objective. This stage (and this line of discourse) is almost an
inseparable and a natural part of an extensive organizational
merger process at an early stage. People feel the need to hang
on to the past and protect the interests they feel might be
under threat. The actual challenge is whether an organization
is capable of overcoming this stage and directing efforts
toward accepting and building a new organization.
Juxtapositions. In addition to the lack of solidarity and team
spirit, we also detected a competitive setting between differ-
ent teams and units. There was talk of "us" and "them"
detectable between groups or teams, between different
regions and units, between professional fields, and between
the personnel and management. In the comments, the partici-
pants felt that both administrative and professional boundar-
ies were easily identifiable. It was also acknowledged that
this weakens the atmosphere, and therefore, the members of
the organization expressed a strong desire for a merger in
attitude regarding the matter. It was described, for example,
as in the following:
We should lower the barriers between different units. (E)
Within our new organization, the old ones still exist. (E)
The organization's elements of friction can be seen and heard
inside the company: Unfortunately, similar messages are also
coming from outside the organization. This sort of flailing
around is also seen to a regrettably large extent as personnel
motivation problems and fears, as well as general dissatisfaction
with the organization's operations. (E)
The rivalry was not malevolent but as a consequence of
uncertainty and established organizational processes. At the
beginning of the change process, it seemed difficult to see
any congruence in tasks with other professionals while it
seemed easier for staff to identify with and relate to their own
professional group. The basic tasks of different units were
interpreted as being very different, even incompatible.
8 SAGE Open
The tasks in the different units are far too different. Sometimes
the interests of business and the environment collide. (M)
Based on the above, we conclude that, at this stage, the
speech reflects the existence of multiple, conflicting, and/or
competing identities (Foreman & Whetten, 2002). There
seem to be many contradictions and conflicts that arise,
among other things, from competing identity claims and
overall identity ambiguity (Pratt & Foreman, 2000). However,
despite the rivalry, suspicion, and the lack of a common goal,
a unifying element across the new organization, according to
the data, seemed to be professional pride and customer
orientation.
Constructing Communality
The bigger picture becomes clear. In the data, expressions high-
lighting the need for cooperation became more evident and
common with time. A sense of community and interactivity
came to the fore in all the data, and themes were segmented
from many perspectives. This can be interpreted to mean that
interactive understanding was something multiple different
parties wanted: The personnel were trying to consider and
understand matters not only from their perspective but also
from the perspective of management, and at the same time, the
personnel had a strong need to feel appreciated and understood
by the management, especially regarding their experiences of
the merger. Management, however, should position itself and
its operations in relation to the control system: In other words,
they should bring up different aspects, their grounds, and the
assigned boundary conditions connected with the transition
concerned more effectively and more often.
As our research project continued, the strong confronta-
tion and critique directed toward management that had
emerged at the outset began to gradually change. Empathy
was shown toward management, and people started to con-
sider the existing skills among direct subordinates, as well as
personal roles in supervisor/subordinate interaction and, in
the same vein, the impact of their own attitude and behavior
on management behavior.
The fourth form of interaction manifested itself in our tex-
tual data in the form of comments where the members of the
organization started talking about shared challenges, where
they expressed their desire to collaborate or reflect on the
distribution of work in the context of common goals and a
common organization. As we argued earlier, this form differs
from the previous one due to shared focus and targets, which
are achieved through mutual contracts between workers.
Talk of a common organization and common areas started to
increase, as did the desire to do things together.
Cooperation over the boundaries of units has increased. (E)
Everyone should have an open mind when viewing what others
do, everyone should have curiosity and I mean it in a positive
way--being interested in others and what they do, showing
appreciation, and helping others when needed. (E)
In the relations between personnel, there was also a desire
for improvement in the spirit of interactivity and community,
for example, between various areas of responsibility or work
tasks.
All of us should be able and willing to break away from familiar
social--and coffee--groups, let's sit at a strange table, and no
one should have a negative attitude towards a plucky person like
that! On the contrary, one should be glad and make sure that the
newcomer is included in the discussions and enjoys him/herself.
It all starts with small gestures and expressions. (E)
The feeling of pulling together, working together towards a
common goal. There is no jealousy over another unit's business.
People are not jealous about other people's things. (E)
Collective appreciation.As demonstrated earlier, the data
included descriptions of how solidarity and team spirit had
evolved alongside with the attitudes of personnel.
Let's try to achieve a common organization and give up going
on about old units . . . we should talk about us . . . there is only
one organization. Individual employees sit where they sit, do
whatever needs to be done, some might be teleworking, some in
a different unit, but at the end of the day, the end result is quality,
professional work and results. (M)
In the descriptions concerning collaboration or the need for
it, the collective view was to perceive work as a united entity--
The perspective seemed to evolve from the individual form to
the form of teams and the entire organization. The develop-
ment, which according to the respondents had taken place, was
described as the evolution of appreciation and trust. The words
"we," "us," and "ours" appeared more often in the comments.
It's important to adopt the idea that the work that is being done
is the work of our organization. It is not mine or yours, it is ours.
I'm calling for adjustment, acceptance and appreciation. (E)
We all should acknowledge that other important tasks exist in
the world, and that our own ones are not the only ones. We all
should adopt an appreciative attitude towards the work others do
and appreciate their professionalism. We should learn to identify
with others, to put ourselves in another's shoes, including the
administrative personnel. Everyone's effort is needed, not only
the supervisors'. We all work for the whole, which cannot be
whole if a part is missing. Management needs to advance the
culture of communality. (E)
Removing professional boundaries.Little by little, the focus
broadened from individual form reflections toward consider-
ations for teams, units, and the entire organization. Many
people wrote about the need to cross and eventually elimi-
nate the existing boundaries:
Mönkkönen and Puusa 9
"The boundaries between different organizational units are way
too high and they need to be lowered" wrote one of the
professionals. (M)
In the third study, we asked about the overall expectations
concerning the management and the organization as a whole.
In these data in particular, the collectively shared agenda
seemed to be the need to lower the boundaries and to enhance
the sense of common organization, unity, and togetherness.
However, although the need was clearly expressed, at this
point in the change process, only very few were able to sug-
gest concrete activities or new ways of doing things to
achieve the desired goals. At both practical and attitudinal
levels, many expressed skepticism toward the possibility of
actually finding common ways of working together even
though it was perceived as ideal. In addition, although these
voices faded toward the end of our study, some wrote about
their doubts throughout all data. Another important notion at
this point was that the reflections concentrated more on the
future instead of the past. It seems that in the context of
merger, the question "who do we want to be" becomes more
relevant, and the construction of a consensual answer to the
question requires active, conscious identity work.
Workers in different professions made a conscious attempt
to understand each other's work and way of thinking. In the
process of renewing organizations, the best outcome is
achieved when the organization's new collective identity is
constructed through dialogue. We placed this kind of dis-
course in the fifth form of interaction, which we outline
below.
State of joint action.As our research project proceeded, we
identified strengthening narratives that illustrated the fifth
form of interaction. The content of the description included
sections highlighting cooperation and communal spirit. The
informants do not present themselves as ideals, but coopera-
tion, communal spirit, and open dialogue exist, and opera-
tions are characterized by a future-oriented mind-set instead
of the limitations of old organizational structures. Organiza-
tional identity stems from when an organization's core func-
tions,whichareinterpretedasshared--earlierseparate--parts
of the organization (units, areas of expertise, teams, and indi-
viduals) seem to be amalgamating or are at least seen as a
crucial part of one whole.
Earlier, we described how a good atmosphere was called
for and how members of the organization perceived an attitu-
dinal change--showing appreciation--as a "tool" for achiev-
ing it. This form of communication shows a positive
atmosphere characterized by trust, which is also related to
cooperation and more efficient operations. Shared future
goals were described as a joint problem-solving mentality
where responsibility is perceived in a collective manner:
We work together as a team, as well as facing challenges together
and solving problems as a team. (E)
Team spirit and polyphony manifested themselves in
descriptions where joint action was perceived as meaningful.
Different views are perceived as opportunities instead of
threats.
Good team spirit at the workplace has always being important to
me. It gives meaning to work . . . collaboration and cooperation.
(E)
. . . Readiness and enthusiasm to face and listen to other people
who do something different or do something differently. (E)
The speech on the topic of collaboration strengthened
after two things: First, it required experiences of doing
actual, concrete work together, and second, the opportunity
to reflect on their work not only individually and with close
colleagues but also with a larger group. The management, at
the minimum, sped up the adaptation process by agreeing to
this participative research project and by creating forums and
arenas for the personnel to express their feelings and thoughts
in a structured manner, individually via the comments and
collectively (the seminars).
While doing so, management did not shy away from criti-
cism directed toward them. By allowing and encouraging
multiple voices and views to come out, management enabled
the construction of a more coherent and collective identity,
which seemed to play an important role in breaking the pat-
tern of holding on to the past and to old groups.
Despite the uncertainty of the future, we commit ourselves to
working for the benefit of our joint organization. We really need
to think about how we can advance and move forward. It starts
with everyone committing themselves to doing their core tasks
with care. It is also about understanding that the core can change
while the organization is changing. (E)
An illustrative example of an element of common identity
was seen when one member of the organization stated,
Of course conflicts of interest may occur, people interpret things
from their own perspectives. It's compromising, but my point is
that all of us should be willing to have an open mind, to broaden
our perspectives to include the whole instead just our own. The
bigger picture is that we aim for the well-being and vitality of our
region. To achieve that task includes all of our areas of expertise
. . . we should all work together towards a common goal. (E)
The idea of collective identity is grounded in a variety of
traditional sociological concepts addressing the "we-ness" of
a particular group (Hardy et al., 2005). Next, we sum up the
results of data.
Conclusion
During the first stage of our research process, the members of
the organization described an interaction that can be regarded
10 SAGE Open
as very formal and devoid of acts of collaboration, which we
interpret as the first form of interaction. In the second form of
interaction, the interplay was determined by hierarchical
interaction. In other words, it was less spontaneous and col-
legial and more one way in nature, where one is a sender and
the other a mere receiver. In this form, interaction and com-
munication are one sided and scarce except between close
colleagues. When interaction and genuine dialogue exist only
between a select few individuals or groups, it is inevitable
that identity-related interpretations at organizational level
will remain very fragmented, whereas wide-ranging dialogue
allows a consensus to be reached (see also Ashforth & Mael,
1989; Scott & Lane, 2000).
In the third form, the members of the organization
described the prevailing tensions between units, teams,
positions, and individuals. The atmosphere was character-
ized by doubt, rivalry, and mistrust. Collaboration was faint,
but at the same time the desire to find common ground
increased significantly. This stage seems to be an important
adaption phase where members of the organization slowly
started letting go of the past and considered the possibility
of partaking in building and identifying with something
new. In the fourth form of interaction, the perspective broad-
ened, and the organization was perceived as a whole. The
desire to work together and advance the construction of a
positive organizational atmosphere that was identified ear-
lier slowly became concrete. There was willingness to cross,
for example, administrative and professional borders.
Finally, in the fifth form of interaction, the texts embody a
strong sense of working as a team, characterized by open
dialogue, trust, and joint action. Our findings concur with
the study conducted by Hardy et al. (2005). They also con-
cluded that organizational identity plays a fundamental role
in achieving collective, or as we call it, joint, action in the
context of collaboration. They argue that "the discursive
construction of a collective identity enables participants to
construct themselves, the problem, and the solution as part
of a collaborative framework in which the potential for joint
action is both significant and beneficial" (Hardy et al., 2005,
p. 63). We argue that if the members of an organization can-
not get past the first three stages of interaction, organiza-
tional identity will inevitably remain fragmented (Albert &
Whetten, 1985; Brown et al., 2005; Pratt & Foreman, 2000;
Puusa, 2009).
In Figure 1, we summarize the forms of interaction
described (see Mönkkönen, 2008).
Discussion
In our article, we have examined how a state of common
understanding evolves via interaction in a public sector orga-
nization going through a merger. With the help of our empiri-
cal data, we have discussed texts that illustrate different
forms of interaction, simultaneously highlighting how con-
struction of a collective identity evolves after a merger. In
addition to this, feelings of uncertainty, skepticism, and cyni-
cism can bring about active resistance to change (Reichers,
Wanous, & Austin, 1997; Stanley, Meyer, & Topolnytsky,

2005). Discussion and the arguments put forward by differ-
ent people during a merger are also dilemmatic (Billig, 1991;
Billig et al., 1988); on one hand, there is a critique of the
common rules, yet on the other hand, the need for them is
accepted as they are perceived as ensuring fairness and
equality. If the emergent meanings and interpretations are
not coherent or conflict with each other, then the identity
remains unstable, in a state of either identity ambiguity or
possible identity conflict (Corley & Gioia, 2004).
The development of organizations is not merely a matter
of progress from one stage of development to another.
Conversely, people look for change in their thoughts and atti-
tudes, and interaction is built with dialogue as well as within
the tensions between doubt and inspiration, independence
and community. Corley and Gioia (2004) argue that all
changes involve processes of "moving from an existing clar-
ity of understanding to doubt, uncertainty, and ambiguity,
and ultimately to a state of renewed clarity that resolves into
an altered form" (p. 174). This seemed to be the case in our
study as well.
According to Harré and Van Langenhove (1998), people
create positions that deviate considerably from each other in
various situations, and these may vary within the same cir-
cumstances or within the same discussion. This interactive
dynamism does not, however, exclude the fact that more per-
manent development is also recognizable in the development
of groups in the direction of an integrated group, and this is
clearly discernible particularly in transitions affecting orga-
nizations. In uncertain situations, it is natural to be on guard,
but by doing things together, those borders gradually begin
to erode. In changes affecting large public organizations,
however, this may take several years (Buhanist, Haramo,
Kallio, Kostamo, & Talja, 2010).
In an organizational merger, the method of management is
important, but the kinds of forms the joint effort takes are
also important. Awareness of the fact that personnel should
be encouraged to work for change is already growing.
Participation assumes various formats: It may be formal,
built on acknowledgment of matters, or it may be a game or
advancement toward common goals. Participation is not just
a matter for management: Rather, personnel also have many
active means at their disposal with which to address passiv-
ity. Some actors may remain in the same position in their
own specialist area, without expanding the frame of their
work to suit the form of the joint group. As Shotter (1993)
has argued, if we see realities as socially constructed, every-
one should have a voice in the process of the construction of
said realities, as well as the right to be taken seriously, and
responded to in a practical manner. From an organizational
identity point of view, in many cases, the fact that those iden-
tity-related socially constructed meanings often come from
the top down is still withheld (Corley & Gioia, 2004).
However, in our case, it can be stated that they emerged in a
bottom­up fashion or even in dialectic processes between
organization members, regardless of position.
Prior research has recognized that common knowledge
and shared views are constructed via the following process:
first identifying distinctive differences, then building new
combinations, and finally, giving new meanings to old things
that, during the process, have become new (Tsoukas, 2009).
It seems that organizational identity also constructs itself
through a similar process after a merger: Characteristic of the
early stages of a new organization is the highlighting of dif-
ferences and distinctions. In time, the new organization starts
to appear as a (new) whole that an individual can identify
with. Corley and Gioia (2004) also argue that if the meanings
provide a coherent sense of collective identity, then stability
can emerge in members'perceptions, ambiguity will subside,
and some new form of "identity clarity" (p. 200) or resolu-
tion can result.
We argue that it is highly likely that after a fundamental
organizational change such as a merger, identity interpreta-
tions are fractured. However, it is not self-evident that, even
in time, the identity interpretations become collective. Our
research thus highlights the relevance and meaning of con-
scious identity work. In this case, it was particularly relevant
that management promoted conscious identity work by pro-
viding a forum for open discussions and social interaction.
While doing so, the management also demonstrated willing-
ness to receive and handle criticism and polyphony.
According to Hardy et al. (2005), a collective identity is a
resource for future references too: Among other things, it can
help with addressing internal conflict situations or in resolv-
ing differences in organizational interests that might other-
wise jeopardize the collaboration between organization
members. It also contributes to the continuance and success
of the newly found basis for collaboration, with Hardy et al.
(2005) stating that collective identity helps individual par-
ticipants "in the collaboration attach importance to an issue,
collectively invest time and energy in it, commit to any com-
promises involved in tackling it, take collective risks, and
secure support from their respective organizations" (p. 63).
According to Bakhtin and Emerson (1993), the concep-
tion of what constitutes "truth" is created via communication
and social interaction processes with others. It is a shared,
common story despite all its polyphony. When cooperation
and collaboration increase and the organizational culture
increasingly includes elements of trust and mutual apprecia-
tion, reaching a common understanding and collective inter-
pretation regarding the organization's central and distinctive
features becomes a possibility.
In conclusion, we argue that the possibility of reaching a
common understanding is heavily dependent on the state and
type of the communication culture prevalent in the organiza-
tion. The basic dichotomy is one-sided communication or
genuine dialogue. Based on our empirical data, we state that
the evolution of a communicational culture after a major
organizational merger is dependent on attitudinal, informa-
tional, and behavioral changes that evolve over time. The
process presumes at least the following stages: first, a
12 SAGE Open
"grief-work" and mourning period during which individuals
and teams reflect on the past and the old organization, which,
in many cases, is perceived in a particularly romantic light.
Second, evolution requires desire and concrete activities that
further the process of people becoming acquainted with one
another. Finally, after gaining awareness, it requires appre-
ciation that manifests itself in attitude and behavior. Based
on this, we conclude that the process is dependent mainly on
intangible issues stressing the importance of time and atti-
tudes. People either allow and advance change or prevent it.
In other words, reaching a state of collaboration character-
ized by reciprocal dialogue requires intangible capital such
as dialogue, cooperation, and collaboration. The role and
acknowledgment of intangible capital are particularly rele-
vant in the context of a professional organization.
