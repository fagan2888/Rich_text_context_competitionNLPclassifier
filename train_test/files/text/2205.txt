Study of American Youth

Objective: Research conducted on school-based interventions suggests that school connectedness
protects against a variety of risk behaviors, including substance abuse, delinquency and sedentary
behavior. The line of research is extended by examining the link between college expectations and early
adult weight gain using nationally representative panel data from thirty cohorts of American high school
seniors followed prospectively to age 30 in the Monitoring the Future Study (1986-2009).
Design and Methods: Growth mixture models identified two latent classes of trajectories of body mass
index (BMI) from age 19 to 30: a persistently overweight class (BMI ! 25) and a second class exhibiting
more moderate growth in BMI to age 30.
Results: Compared to those who did not expect to graduate from college, students fully expecting to
graduate from college had 34% lower odds of being in the persistently overweight class (adjusted odds
ratio ¼ 0.66, 95% confidence interval ¼ 0.54, 0.81), controlling for academic performance and
socioeconomic status.
Conclusions: Successful prevention of obesity early in the life course is based on a multifactorial
approach incorporating strategies that address the contexts in which adolescents are embedded. The
school setting may be one avenue where successful educational attachment could have positive
consequences for subsequent weight gain in early adulthood.

Introduction
There is a growing literature on the link between the school experi-
ence and adolescent health. School attachment or school connectedness
(captured, for example, in the form of participation in school sports,
less intensive work in paid employment during school years, or college
aspirations) have been found to be positively related to adolescent
health behaviors (1,2). For instance, participation in school clubs has
been shown to be associated with regular exercise and a healthy diet
(3,4), and with lower rates of cigarette, alcohol, and illicit drug use
(5). Conversely, students who work intensively in paid employment
during their high school years (i.e. working more than 20 h per week)
are less likely to eat breakfast and tend to get less sleep (6,7).
There is also evidence that school connectedness in adolescence has
positive consequences for subsequent health and academic success
in early adulthood. Students working intensively in paid employment
during high school obtain fewer years of education and are less
likely to obtain a college degree (8-11). Using prospective data from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (1995-2001),
McDade et al. (12) found that high school and middle school
students who reported a high probability of attending college subse-
quently exercised more frequently in young adulthood (age 18-26).
This finding persisted when controlling for parental education, base-
line physical and mental health, family structure, and the student's
school and neighborhood environment.
These findings suggest that young people invest their time in differ-
ent behaviors depending on their goals or expectations for the
future. Within a set of resources and opportunities, an orientation to-
ward the future rather than the present may contribute to healthy
behaviors if individuals favor delayed benefits over immediate

reward (12). Perceived life chances may play an important role in
youth decisions regarding risk and health behaviors, with the result
that more forward-thinking adolescents who fully expect to pursue a
college education may invest more heavily in a healthy lifestyle to
meet future goals (13). Holding high the belief in extended educa-
tion beyond high school captures an adolescent's ``planful compe-
tence'' (14), including a sense of direction over one's life. As a
result, future expectations with respect to educational attainment
may have ensuing consequences for health outcomes such as obesity
and overweight through the practice of healthy behaviors over time.
In the United States and much of the developed world the prevalence of
obesity has been increasing, with the most rapid increases occurring dur-
ing the mid-1980s and 1990s (15). Successful prevention of overweight
and obesity early in the life course is based on a multifactorial approach
incorporating strategies that address the physical and social contexts in
which adolescents are embedded (15,16). The school context may be
one avenue where successful school attachment could have positive con-
sequences for subsequent weight gain in early adulthood. However,
there is also an issue surrounding reverse causality in this relationship
because the stigma of obesity may result in lower school attachment.
Indeed, Shore and colleagues (17) found that overweight middle school
students had lower grades, more detentions, lower school attendance,
and more tardiness than their nonoverweight peers. Similarly, in a
national sample Crosnoe and Muller (18) found that overweight adoles-
cents had lower academic achievement, especially in schools in which
overweight was stigmatized. However, there is also evidence that
severely obese adolescents are not more depressed than their peers (19),
suggesting that obesity may not be as consequential for psychosocial
outlook or future aspirations. Nonetheless, from a policy perspective,
promoting school attachment in high risk groups may prove to be a
worthwhile initiative regardless of whether obesity surfaced prior to, or
in response to, a weak school connection (2,16,20).
The purpose of this research was to examine the role of college
expectations among high school seniors for subsequent trajectories
of weight gain over early adulthood (to age 30). We draw on data
from a nationally representative multicohort sample of American
youth collected prospectively from age 18, which has been ongoing
on an annual basis since 1976. As a result, we have the opportunity
to examine the role of college aspirations on growth rates of early
adult weight gain, accounting for birth cohort. We also control for
potentially endogenous factors including academic performance
throughout high school and parents' education, both of which could
influence college expectations, weight gain, or both. We hypothesize
that controlling for these competing factors, students with higher
expectations to graduate from a 4-year college program will exhibit
slower rates of weight gain over early adulthood than those with
lower college expectations.
Methods and Procedures
Study population
Data come from the monitoring the future (MTF) project, a nation-
wide school-based survey of tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use, con-
ducted annually in the United States since 1975 (21). The survey also
monitors lifestyles and behaviors, including self-reported measures of
respondents' weight and height collected since 1986. MTF is an
ongoing cohort sequential study (described in more detail elsewhere
(22)) involving a nationally representative sample of high school
seniors surveyed in the spring of each year ($15,000 per year). Each
year's data collection takes place in $120-146 public and private high
schools selected to provide an accurate representative cross-section of
12th graders throughout the coterminous United States.
A representative subsample ($2,400 students/year) is randomly
selected from each cohort for six biennial follow-ups using self-com-
pleted mailed questionnaires to the age of 30 (a half-sample is fol-
lowed on alternate years); thus, the first follow-up occurs at age 19 or
20, the second at age 21 or 22, and so on. Drug users (regular users of
marijuana or any use of illicit drugs in the previous 30 days) were
oversampled for participation in the panel component by a ratio of 3
to 1 and then reweighted in the analyses as discussed below. To ease
respondent burden, panel respondents are randomly assigned to receive
one of five different questionnaires, each with their own set of ques-
tions. Since 1986 a random one-fifth of respondents ($480 students
per year) received a questionnaire asking about height and weight.
For our purposes we focus on subjects in 30 high school cohorts
entering the study between 1976 and 2005 (inclusive) and examine
their trajectories of weight gain from age 19 to 30. Because height
and weight data were collected beginning in 1986, not all high school
cohorts contributed data at all ages, but we make use of a statistical
method that takes account of unbalanced designs to use data on all
cohorts through 2009 (23). This yields a sample of 10,099 individuals
who were between the ages of 19 and 30 over this 23-year period.
On average, each subject contributed 3.5 observations (61.6) over the
six follow up periods, generating about 6,000 observations at each
follow-up. Roughly one-third of the observations span the entire age
range of interest (age 19-30). All study procedures are reviewed and
approved on an annual basis by the University of Michigan's Institu-
tional Review Board (IRB) for compliance with federal guidelines for
the treatment of human subjects.
Measures
Using repeated self-reported measures of height and weight, weight
gain over early adulthood was captured with the body mass index
(BMI ¼ kg mÀ2). A BMI of 25-29 is used to define ``overweight,''
while a BMI score of 30 or above represents ``obese.'' (BMI scores
were not included for women who were pregnant at the time of fol-
low-up.) Three variables capture key indicators of early social position
found to be related to life time obesity as well as to school attach-
ment: (i) gender; (ii) race/ethnicity (self-reported by respondents and
modeled using three dummy variables contrasting Non-Hispanic Black,
Hispanic, and other race/ethnic (including Asian) respondents with
Non-Hispanic White respondents); and (iii) childhood socioeconomic
status (SES) (the maximum of the respondent's parents' education,
dichotomized as high school degree or less vs. 4-year college degree
or higher). We also adjust for cohort differences using three 10-year
cohorts of high school seniors (1976-1985, 1986-1995, 1996-2005).
Respondents in their senior year of high school were asked about
their college expectations with the question, ``How likely is it that
you will graduate from college (4-year program)?'' Response
options were: definitely won't, probably won't, probably will, defi-
nitely will. Following McDade et al. (12) we classify these response
categories according to a probabilistic coding scheme where 0 repre-
sents no chance, 0.25 indicates some chance (but probably not),
0.75 indicates a good chance (probably will), and 1.0 captures the
expected certainty (definitely will) of college graduation. We also
control for high school academic performance, which was asked

using an ordinal nine category measure of each respondent's average
grade throughout high school (e.g., A (93-100), A­ (90-92),... D (69
or below)). For analytic purposes, we used the mid-point value of
each category (e.g., A ¼ 96) to create a continuous index of average
high school grade, and divided each value by 10 for the statistical
models (range 6.9 to 9.6).
Statistical analyses
We used generalized growth mixture modeling to identify latent
classes of individuals according to their early adult patterns of
BMI growth. Growth mixture modeling is an extension of conven-
tional growth modeling that relaxes the assumption of a single pop-
ulation trajectory. By using latent trajectory classes (categorical
latent variables), the growth mixture model allows different classes
of individuals to vary around different mean growth curves (24).
The trajectory of interest in this article is weight gain
(captured with BMI), measured prospectively over young adult-
hood (age 19-30).
The measurement part of the model captures the growth factors
(intercept and slope) as measured by multiple indicators of BMI
over time (Figure 1). A linear growth model is specified with equi-
distant time points, but we also test the fit of a nonlinear form by
using quadratic terms. The structural part of the model incorporates
the growth model within a larger latent variable model by relating
the growth factors to other observed and latent variables. Of particu-
lar interest is the latent trajectory class variable, which represents
the unobserved subpopulation of membership for respondents. This
allows a separate growth model for each of the latent classes. Col-
lege expectations (controlling for school performance, socioeco-
nomic, and socio-demographic covariates) predict class membership
in a multinomial logistic regression.
Model building proceeded in a sequential process by first specifying
the measurement model and then incrementally increasing the num-
ber of latent classes. While substantively-based theory is used as the
primary means to determine the best fitting model, good fitting mod-
els are characterized by (i) a low value for the Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC); (ii) a statis-
tically significant (low P value) Lo-Mendell-Rubin (LMR) likelihood
ratio test; and (iii) distinct posterior probabilities for individual class
membership (24). All models are estimated in Mplus Version 6.12
(25) using full information maximum likelihood (FIML) with robust
standard errors. Multiple random starts are used to minimize local
optimal in the likelihood. Respondent-level weights are used to adjust
for unequal selection probabilities in the panel study.
Retention rates in the panel respondents are highest in the first follow-
up after high school (averaging 70%), and fall to an average of 64% in
the biennial follow-ups through to age 30 (25). Using logistic regres-
sion analysis (with backward elimination) we modeled the probability
of study retention to age 30 according to a broad array of baseline
characteristics and found that being Non-Hispanic White, and reporting
a higher average grade in high school increased the odds of retention.
By including these variables in our models, maximum likelihood

Results
Sociodemographic characteristics, academic indicators, and BMI
scores over early adulthood are presented in Table 1. On average
respondents had a normal weight in the year following high school
(BMI ¼ 23.3 (SD ¼ 3.7), Table 1) but these cohorts of American
youth gained weight steadily over early adulthood, reporting an
average BMI of 25.4 (SD ¼ 4.3) by age 30. The average reported
probability of graduating from a 4-year college program was 68%.
Almost half of the sample fully expected to graduate from a 4-year
college program, while 16% indicated that they definitely would
not. On average, respondents reported an average grade throughout
high school around 85 (SD ¼ 6.95).
Table 2 reports the results and fit statistics for a systematic progres-
sion of growth mixture models. The first column presents the results
for the single class model. Average BMI at age 19 is 23.1 (intercept)
and increases by 0.28 points each year (slope, P < 0.001) until age
30. There was no evidence of any quadratic form to the models and
the distribution of BMI at each time point was roughly normal justi-
fying the linear model. The fit of the model improved by allowing
for correlated error between BMI measures at adjacent time points
(results not shown; all correlations are statistically significant at P <
0.0001). The second and third columns of Table 2 report the results
for the two-class solution. The change in the BIC and AIC values,
coupled with a significant Lo-Mendel-Rubin Likelihood ratio test (P
< 0.001, not shown), suggest that a two class solution is preferable
to a single class model. Membership in each class showed good
classification quality with individuals most likely to belong to their
predicted class (posterior probability is markedly higher (>0.90)
than for the other class). Adding a third class (model not shown) did
not result in any improvement in model fit and the posterior proba-
bilities did not differentiate class membership well.
Figure 2 shows the estimated growth curves for BMI from age 19 to
30 according to the 2 class solution. (Observed means and 95% con-
fidence intervals are also presented.) The two curves represent two
distinct trajectories of BMI growth from early adulthood: Class 1
(with 78.3% of the sample) represents the majority of the sample,
which we term the ``normative class,'' with an average BMI of 21.6
following high school and a steady rate of growth in BMI up to age
30 (slope ¼ 0.22, P < 0.001). Conversely, individuals in Class 2
(21.7% of the sample) were on average overweight at high school
graduation (mean BMI ¼ 26.8) and gained weight more rapidly
throughout the next 11 years (slope ¼ 0.43, P < 0.001), which we
term the ``persistently overweight class.'' The model supports a
class-varying factor covariance matrix, where the growth factor var-
iances are allowed to differ across classes. Results indicate greater
variance around the intercept and slope for the persistently over-
weight class (r2 ¼ 20.84 and 0.28, respectively) compared to the
normative class (r2 ¼ 4.01 and 0.02, respectively).
The next step in the modeling process adds the covariates to the
model, regressing gender, race/ethnicity, childhood SES, high school
cohort, academic performance and college expectations on class
membership. Table 3 reports the results from the logistic regression
for class membership (adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence
intervals) using the normative latent class as the reference group.
Compared to individuals in the normative class, individuals in the
persistently overweight class were more likely to be female, Non-
Hispanic Black, and to have parents with a high school education or
less. There were strong cohort differences in the odds of class mem-
bership, with more recent cohorts of high school seniors more likely
to be in the persistently overweight class than those who were high
school seniors in the mid-1970's and early 1980's. Better academic

performance through high school was associated with a reduced
odds of being in latent class 2, with each ten point increase in aver-
age high school grade associated with a 26% lower odds of being in
the persistently overweight class (odds ratio ¼ 0.74, 95% confidence
interval ¼ 0.66, 0.83), all other things being equal. Controlling for
academic performance and sociodemographic covariates, expecting
to graduate from college was associated with reduced odds of mem-
bership in the persistently overweight class. Compared to those who
did not expect to graduate from college, students fully expecting to
graduate from college had a 34% lower odds of being in the persis-
tently overweight class (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 0.66, 95% confidence
interval ¼ 0.54, 0.81), controlling for academic performance, child-
hood SES and other covariates.
The model also captures latent class-specific effects of the covari-
ates on the growth factors. Table 4 presents the unstandardized
regression coefficients (with standard errors) for the effects of the
covariates on BMI intercept and slope for each of the two latent
classes. Within the persistently overweight class, the rate of growth
in BMI is more rapid for women and for those in more recent high
school cohorts. Those who were high school seniors after 1995 also
had significantly higher BMI at age 19/20 (intercept) than those
who graduated from high school in earlier years. Within the norma-
tive class, women and other race/ethnic groups had significantly
lower BMI at baseline, but non-Hispanic Blacks, and those with low
childhood SES experienced more rapid growth in BMI in this class;
women experienced less rapid growth. Cohort differences were also
observed in the normative class, with more recent cohorts having
significantly higher BMI at baseline (age 19/20) and significantly
more rapid increase in BMI over early adulthood. We also ran a
similar sequence of models stratified by gender, but there were no
differences in effects between men and women.
Discussion
Using data from a multicohort national sample of high school
seniors followed throughout early adulthood, this article examined
the role of college expectations for subsequent weight gain over
early adulthood. On average, these high school seniors reported a
68% chance that they would graduate from a 4-year college pro-
gram, slightly lower than the probability reported elsewhere by
younger adolescents (grades 7 through 11) (12), which asked only
about the expectation of attending college (not graduating from a 4-
year degree program). Yet, having these expectations was associated
with less rapid weight gain over early adulthood. This finding was

independent of socioeconomic and sociodemographic confounders as
well as academic performance throughout high school.
Evidence suggests that diminished expectations for the future may
undermine the adoption of positive health behaviors related to obe-
sity, including exercise and healthy eating (13). As argued by
McDade et al. (12), the extent to which individuals favor immediate
utility over delayed utility may influence health behaviors that lead
to weight gain at this life stage. Fostering school attachment, partic-
ularly through the promotion of norms and expectations for
academic pursuits in the school setting, may therefore have positive
consequences for adolescent weight gain over time (2). The transi-
tion to adulthood (sometimes referred to as emerging or early adult-
hood (27)) is particularly important because individuals are on their
own typically for the first time, when life plans are put into action,
and when trajectories of risk become more manifest (28). As a
result, this may be a particularly salient period of adolescent devel-
opment for obesity prevention and intervention strategies. To the
extent that adolescents are bonded or attached to schools at this life
stage, their adoption of forward-thinking expectations is encouraged
because they are motivated to conform to the norms, expectations,
and values of that socialization unit (29). For example, adolescents
who are poorly bonded to school are more likely to use cigarettes
and alcohol than adolescents who are well bonded to school (30,31).
Our results extend this line of thinking by suggesting a broader con-
struct termed ``educational connectedness,'' measured here in terms
of college expectations, has positive consequences for moderate
growth in BMI over early adulthood. Whereas school connectedness
relates to the experiences during adolescence in terms of connec-
tions with the school context, educational connectedness relates to
the long-term belief in the power and importance of education in
setting the stage for competence across the life course (14). Holding
high the belief in extended education beyond high school captures
an adolescent's ``apparent readiness to take responsibility for self''
(14:806), including beliefs in individual control over life direction
and health behaviors.
The connection between college expectations and trajectories of
BMI may also be a function of actually obtaining a college degree
in early adulthood. However, this is complicated in that obese ado-
lescents, especially obese girls, are less likely to attend college than
their non-obese age-mates (32), yet college attendance is typically
associated with weight gain, at least initially (33). A lack of com-
plete data on actual college graduation in these data prevented us
from assessing the mediating role of college degree for college
expectations. However, replicating our analysis with a half sample
of respondents with complete data on college graduation showed no
difference in the effects of college expectations on latent class
membership.
Our results also identified strong and persistent cohort differences in
trajectories of weight gain over early adulthood, which parallel the
observed increase in the rates of obesity and overweight in the
United States since the mid-1980s (15). More recent cohorts of high
school seniors were more likely to be in the persistently overweight
class than those who were high school seniors in the mid-1970s and
early 1980s. Even within each trajectory class, more recent high
school cohorts also had higher BMI at age 19/20 and faster rates of
growth in BMI through to age 30. Consistent with the existing
research (34), we also noted significant gender, socioeconomic, and
race/ethnic disparities in the propensity to be in the persistently
overweight trajectory, as well as in the rates of growth in BMI over
early adulthood.
Strengths and Limitations
There are noteworthy strengths of this study. The use of nationally
representative, multicohort, multiwave prospective longitudinal data
spanning the transition to adulthood provides a strong methodologi-
cal foundation for the findings, allowing a level of confidence
beyond what is typical in the literature. In addition, we use leading
edge statistical strategies to control for potential confounds and
identify and predict distinct time-varying latent classes of BMI.
There are also noteworthy limitations. Our study is limited by self-
reported measures of height and weight, which tend to be underesti-
mated (35). However, self-reported values of height tend to be
highly correlated with their measured values (36,37), making them
useful for assessing population trends over time. Measures of
weight-related health behaviors were also unavailable in these data,
preventing us from testing the mediating role of health behaviors in
the pathway between college expectations and weight gain through
to age 30. In addition, it is unclear whether the relationship between
college expectations and weight gain reflects preexisting differences
among students in terms of socioeconomic background, orientations
towards further education and weight-related health behaviors. For
example, overweight youths from a lower socioeconomic back-
ground with poor access to healthy foods and limited opportunities
for exercise may also have low expectations for college attendance.
While we attempted to control for these common causes in our anal-
yses, we cannot rule out the role of unobserved variables.
Our main independent variable of interest, college expectations, cap-
tures many factors which could be operating in weight gain in early
adulthood. Much of the existing research looking at health behaviors
has examined school connectedness in terms of participation in
school clubs and sports, and one recent study (12) examined the link
between college expectations and physical activity. We further this
area of research by considering the implications of college expecta-
tions as a marker for the way young adults assess their future trajec-
tory and their health and lifestyle choices along the way. However,
it is noteworthy that in a separate regression model (results not
shown), college expectations were significantly associated (P <
0.01) with other measures of school attachment available in our
data, including liking school, the perception that school has mean-
ing, satisfaction with overall educational experience, and number of
days skipped school (negatively associated) (controlling for gender
and race/ethnicity). However, these measures were not significantly
associated with BMI trajectories in our models.
What happens at school is critically important for adolescent health
and development (38) and schools have been identified as a key set-
ting for public health strategies to lower or prevent the prevalence
of overweight and obesity (39,40). Beyond strategies designed to
promote physical activity or limit the availability of snacks and soft
drinks, research conducted on school-based interventions suggests
that school connectedness serves to protect against a variety of risk
behaviors, including substance abuse, delinquency and sedentary
behavior (2,3,30). We extend this line of research by examining the
link between college expectations and early adult weight gain.
Results suggest that attention to subjective life chances may provide
opportunities for intervention in school settings, particularly in the
