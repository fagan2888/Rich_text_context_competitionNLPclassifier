Health Outcomes in Young Adults From Foster Care
and Economically Diverse Backgrounds
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Youth in foster care are at
higher risk of health problems at entrance and during their stays
in care. Little is known about this group's risk of health problems
in young adulthood, in comparison with other populations of
young adults.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first prospective study to our
knowledge demonstrating that former foster youth are at higher
risk of chronic health problems than economically secure and
insecure general population young adults.
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Foster youth have high rates of health
problems in childhood. Little work has been done to determine
whether they are similarly vulnerable to increased health problems
once they transition to adulthood. We sought to prospectively evaluate
the risk of cardiovascular risk factors and other chronic conditions
among young adults formerly in foster care (FC) and young adults from
economically insecure (EI) and economically secure (ES) backgrounds
in the general population.
METHODS: We used data from the Midwest Evaluation of the Adult Func-
tioning of Former Foster Youth (FC group; N = 596) and an age-
matched sample from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (EI and ES groups; N = 456 and 1461, respectively). After
controlling for covariates, we performed multivariate regressions to
evaluate health outcomes and care access by group at 2 time points
(baseline at late adolescence, follow-up at 25­26 years).
RESULTS: Data revealed a consistent pattern of graduated increase in
odds of most health outcomes, progressing from ES to EI to FC groups.
Health care access indicators were more variable; the FC group was
most likely to report having Medicaid or no insurance but was least
likely to report not getting needed care in the past year.
CONCLUSIONS: Former foster youth appear to have a higher risk of
multiple chronic health conditions, beyond that which is associated
with economic insecurity. Findings may be relevant to policymakers
and practitioners considering the implementation of extended insur-
ance and foster care programs and interventions to reduce health dis-
parities in young adulthood. Pediatrics 2014;134:1067­1074

ARTICLE
Foster youth are an understudied pop-
ulation with high rates of chronic and
untreated health conditions, both upon
entrance into and while in foster care.1­5
Consequently, in 2009 the Institute of
Medicine highlighted them as a priority
population for federally funded re-
search.6
There are many reasons to expect that
former foster youth may be vulnerable
to similarly elevated rates of chronic
health problems once they transition to
adulthood. Foster youth are often ex-
posed to poverty and many other ad-
verse childhood experiences including
abuse, neglect, domestic violence, and
parental substance use, and many un-
dergo frequent placement and school
changes while in foster care.1,7,8 Several
theories exist regarding the effects of
chronic and early exposures to ad-
versity, all of which suggest that the
more stressors towhich one is exposed,
the higher the likelihood of a chronic
physical or mental health condition
later in life.9­15 However, to our knowl-
edge only 1 retrospective study has
evaluated this question specifically in
foster youth; this study suggested that
adults with foster care experience had
higher odds of a physical health prob-
lem than those who had never been in
foster care.16
In addition to, and likely because of,
these early exposures, a large per-
centage of youth emancipating from
fostercareliveinpovertyorexperience
unemployment or homelessness in
young adulthood, potentially limiting
access to needed health care.17­22
Conversely, extended Medicaid and FC
programs during young adulthood
have been associated with improved
reproductive health access and out-
comes for this population; the impact
of extended FC on other types of phys-
ical health problems in this population
has not been studied.23,24 Two provi-
sions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
in effect as of 2014, are relevant to
former foster youth: a provision extend-
ing Medicaid coverage through age 26
years to young adults who were in
foster care on their 18th birthday and
a provision that provides coverage to
all nonelderly people with incomes
#133% of the federal poverty level in
participating states.24 However, many
states have not extended Medicaid to
low-income single adults, pursuant to
a recent US Supreme Court decision
that upheld the constitutionality of the
ACA but also held that state participa-
tion in Medicaid expansion is op-
tional.25 Thus, former foster youth who
have incomes ,133% of the federal
poverty level who were not in care on
their 18th birthday may not have ac-
cess to Medicaid, depending on the
state in which they were emancipated
from care. Additionally, many states do
not provide Medicaid coverage to for-
mer foster youth who were emanci-
pated in another state. Finally, recent
federal legislation has also provided
financial incentives for states to extend
foster care to age 21 (with accompa-
nying extended medical coverage),26
although many still routinely discharge
foster youth at age 18.
An understanding of this population's
risk of chronic medical problems and
health care access will be helpful to
inform policies and practices at the
state and federal levels. Our objective
was to compare the risks of chronic
health problems and access indica-
tors among young adults transitioning
out of the foster system with those of
youth in the general population with
and without exposure to economic
insecurity.
METHODS
Study Design, Sample, and Data
Collection Procedures
Weuseddatafrom2longitudinalcohorts:
the National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health (Add Health), a large,
nationally representative sample of
youth transitioning to adulthood in the
United States,27 and the Midwest Eval-
uation of the Adult Functioning of
Former Foster Youth (Midwest Study),
a study evaluating youth in Illinois, Iowa,
and Wisconsin as they transitioned out
offostercare.1­4 Humansubjectsapproval
and informed consent were obtained
in both studies. The present analyses
were determined exempt for human
subjects review, because all data were
deidentified.
Add Health (Economically Secure and
Insecure Groups)
The Add Health Study consists of 4
data waves collected primarily via
in-home audio computer-assisted methods
(baseline N for in-home interviews =
20 745). Youth were included in the
current study if they participated in
waves 3 (2001­2002) and 4 (2007­
2009), were 25 to 26 years old at wave
4, and had not been in foster care by
wave 3 (N = 1917). The sample was
then subdivided into 2 groups. The eco-
nomically insecure (EI) group included
youth who reported any of the follow-
ing in the past 12 months at wave 3:
receipt of income from food stamps,
Aid to Families With Dependent Chil-
dren, public assistance, welfare, or
a state Temporary Assistance to Needy
Families program, inability to pay full
amount of rent or utilities, eviction,
having utilities shut off, inability to see
doctor or dentist because they could
not afford it, or current receipt of Med-
icaid (N = 456). The economically secure
(ES) group included youth who reported
none of these markers (N = 1461).
Midwest Study (foster care Group)
Youth were eligible for the Midwest
Study if they were 17 years old at re-
cruitment and had been in out-of-home
care for $1 year. Youth who were in
a psychiatric or correctional facility,
were on runaway status, or had a dis-
ability preventing survey completion
1068 AHRENS et al
were excluded. Most interviews were
conducted in person, and computer-
assisted techniques were used for
sensitive subjects. Participants were
interviewed every 2 years until age 25
or 26; we used data from waves 1
(2002­2003; age 17­18) and 5 (2010­
2011; age 25­26). A total of 732 partic-
ipated in wave 1. Of those, 81% partic-
ipated in wave 5 as well and were
included in the current study (foster
care or FC group; N = 596). Hereafter,
wave 3 of Add Health and wave 1 of the
Midwest Study will be referred to as
time 1, and wave 4 of Add Health and
wave 5 of the Midwest Study will be
referred to as time 2.
Variables
All variables were collected via self-
report.
Outcomes
Individual Health Outcomes
Data were available at time 1 and 2 in
both studies for 2 outcomes: general
health (dichotomized at fair/poor ver-
sus good/very good/excellent) and BMI.
We also evaluated several chronic
health conditions assessed at time 2
only. Wording of questions for these
variables differed slightly between
studies (Table 1). Participants were
initially asked whether they had a con-
dition or health problem, whether it
limited their activities, and how long it
had been present. They were then
asked about the following conditions:
seizure disorder, attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma,
dyslipidemia, hypertension, and di-
abetes. For these outcomes, youth
were coded as 0 if the youth reported
that a condition did not limit their daily
activities or had been present for ,1
year. We also assessed whether par-
ticipants reported being a chronic,
regular smoker, defined as having ever
smoked "regularly" and smoking all of
the past 30 days.
Combined Health Outcome Variables
(Time 2 Only)
Wegenerated2summaryvariables:any
cardiovascular risk factor (dyslipidemia,
hypertension, diabetes, smoker, or BMI
$30) and other chronic illness (seizure
disorder, ADHD, or asthma).
Health Care Access Indicators (Time 2
Only)
Weassessedthefollowingdichotomous
variables: no insurance, having Medic-
aid, not getting needed medical care in
the past year, and time since last
physical examination (#1 year versus
.1 year).
Covariates
We included gender, race (white ver-
sus African American versus other
race), ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-
Hispanic), education level at time 2
(high school diploma versus no di-
ploma) and economic insecurity at time
2 (defined as currently homeless or any
of the following in the past 12 months:
inability to pay full amount of rent or
utilities, eviction, utilities shut off, or
being worried whether food would run
out before there was money to buy
more), and current age as covariates in
the main analyses. For female-only
analyses, we also included a variable
reflecting history of past or current
pregnancy, given a known impact on
some outcomes (eg, diabetes, hyper-
tension).
Analyses
We performed descriptive statistics
comparing univariate associations be-
tween the covariates and group status,
then we used multivariate regres-
sion analyses (linear for continuous
outcomes, logistic for dichotomous
outcomes) to compare the health
outcomes across groups after con-
trolling for covariates. For outcomes
measuredattimes1 and 2 (BMI, general
health), we used multiple regression
analyses for repeated measures. As
exploratory analyses, we ran these
modelswithandwithouttimebyEIand
time by FC interaction terms to de-
termine whether the effect of group
differed at the 2 time points. We also
assessed the following outcomes for

hypotheses of a potential gender by
group interaction: BMI, cardiovascular
risk summary variable, no insurance,
receipt of Medicaid, not getting needed
care, and time since last examination.
Statistically, we did this by adding
gender by EI and gender by FC in-
teraction terms into analyses, then
examining the significance of the in-
teraction and performing stratified
analyses where indicated. Finally, we
performed sensitivity analyses drop-
ping females who had ever been
pregnant from the hypertension and
diabetes analyses, giventhe difference
in wording between studies for these
questions. For all analyses, we treated
ES as the reference group.
RESULTS
Results of univariate analyses indi-
cated that all covariates were asso-
ciated with group status. They also
revealed a consistent pattern of graded
increasein riskacross cohorts formost
outcomes, progressing from ES to EI to
FC groups (Table 2). This pattern held
after adjustment for covariates. For ex-
ample, the EI group had a significantly
higher odds of reporting poor or fair
general health than the ES group (odds
ratio [OR] 1.53; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.19 to 1.97); however, the FC group
reported even higher odds of this out-
come (OR 2.30; 95% CI, 1.84 to 2.89). The
average BMIs in the EI and FC groups
were also higher than in the ES group,
with the FC group having the highest
BMI (b = 0.51; 95% CI, ­0.09 to 1.10 for EI
and b = 0.90; 95% CI, 0.32 to 1.49 for FC;
relationship significant for FC only).

with seizures in the ES group. Figure 2
contains results of our 2 summary var-
iables. There were 2 notable exceptions
to the pattern of graded increased risk
from ES to EI to FC; the EI group was
less likely to report ADHD than the ES
group, but the FC group was by far the
most likely to report this outcome, and
no differences were found by group
for dyslipidemia. When we compared
the FC and ES groups most ORs were
significant; for diabetes the relation-
ship was nonsignificant but followed
a similar trend (P = .06). In contrast,
the EI group had only 2 outcomes for
which odds were significant when
compared with the ES group (asthma
and smoker; OR 2.32; 95% CI, 1.11 to
4.83 and OR 1.81; 95% CI, 1.40 to 2.34,
respectively).
With respect to insurance status, the EI
and FC groups were once again more
likely to report having no insurance (OR
1.76;95%CI,1.36to2.27andOR2.21;95%
CI, 1.73 to 2.82, respectively) or having
Medicaid (OR 3.56; 95% CI, 2.53 to 5.01
and OR 13.16; 95% CI, 9.42 to 18.40, re-
spectively). Although the EI group was
also significantly more likely to report
not getting needed care in the past year
at time 2 (OR 1.32; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.67),
the FC group was less likely to report
this outcome (OR 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27 to
0.49) than the ES group. Neither group
was significantly different in terms of
the time since their last health exami-
nation compared with the ES reference
group.
The relationship between group status
and outcomes did not vary by time for
our 2 multiple-time-point outcomes
(BMI and general health). With respect
to gender moderation, interaction
terms for the gender by FC analyses
were significant for all outcomes eval-
uated except time since last exami-
nation. Specifically, females in the FC
grouphadahigherBMIthanthoseinthe
ES group, but FC males had a lower BMI
than their ES counterparts (b = 1.73;
95% CI, 0.86 to 2.61 for females and b =
­0.26; 95% CI, ­1.07 to 0.55 for males;
P value of interaction term ,.001). In
contrast, both males and females in the
FC group had a higher odds of having
$1 cardiovascular risk factor and
lower odds of not receiving needed
care compared with their ES counter-
parts, but these gaps were significantly
wider for females than males (P = .004
and .041 for cardiovascular risk factor
and not receiving needed care in-
teraction terms, respectively). Both
genders were more likely to report
having no insurance or receiving
Medicaid if they were in the FC group;
however, males in the FC group had
higher ORs than females for the no-
insurance outcomes (P , .001), and
the reverse was true for odds of re-
ceiving Medicaid (P = .001). Only 1
gender by EI interaction was signifi-
cant; for the Medicaid outcome, the
effect of being in the EI group was
larger for females than for males (P =
.049). Sensitivity analyses revealed
trends similar to the main analyses in
all instances.
DISCUSSION
Results are consistent with the chronic
stress literature and previous retro-
spective work evaluating the adult
health outcomes of former foster youth,
which suggests that exposure to eco-
nomic insecurity and the other chronic
stressors associated with having been
in foster care have the potential to in-
fluence young adult health outcomes in
a cumulative fashion.9­12,16 Many health

conditions have their origins in the
childhood and teenage years; thus find-
ings are relevant not only for public and
private agencies serving former foster
youth but also for those serving youth
currently in foster care.
Our access indicators suggest that
former foster youth do not perceive
a lack of needed medical care during
young adulthood; previous analyses
reveal that foster youth also perceive
similar or higher rates of access to
medical care compared with general
population youth while they are still in
care.1 However, it is important to note
that access to "needed care" does not
equate to access to high-quality, evidence-
based care. Medical care for foster
youth is often discontinuous, making it
difficult for trusting patient­provider
relationships to form and evidence-
based treatments to be delivered.28,29
Although little research has evaluated
continuity and quality of care among
emancipated foster youth, there is little
reason to believe these problems improve
as foster youth become young adults
facing homelessness, unemployment,
and other issues known to affect quality
of health care.17­22,30,31
Future exploration is merited to de-
termine care-related contributors to
this group's disproportionate disease
burden. Quantitative and qualitative
research should be conducted to bet-
ter delineate the specific types of care
these youth receive (and lack), the con-
tinuity and quality of provider relation-
ships they experience, and the degree
to which they receive evidence-based
care for chronic medical conditions
during adolescence and the transition
to adulthood. Current and former foster
youth may benefit from a level of pre-
ventive health care beyond that which
is recommended for general popula-
tion youth,32,33 including strategies to
promote access to state-of-the-art in-
terventions targeting modifiable car-
diovascular risk factors such as diet,
exercise, and smoking cessation. Train-
ing and resources for caseworkers,
foster parents, and group home staff
emphasizing the importance of conti-
nuity and quality of health care pro-
vider relationships in addition to timely
access may also be beneficial. Previous
research on chronic disease man-
agement in adult populations with
the types of maladaptive relation-
ship styles resultant from early ad-
versity suggests that policies and
programs may need to be tailored to
the unique life experiences of foster
youth to have maximal effect, for ex-
ample, including individualized strategies
to promote the formation of trusting
relationships with health care and al-
lied providers.34 Support to maintain
these relationships across placement
changes may also be beneficial. Given
the moderating effect of gender in our
analyses of BMI and other cardiovas-
cular risk factors, young women formerly
in foster care should be a particular
focus in policy and intervention work,
although male youth are also likely to
benefit.
Finally,the needsofformerfosteryouth
should be considered when states are
contemplating participation in Medic-
aid expansion and other policies to
extend insurance or foster care for
this vulnerable population. Our pre-
vious work suggests that the majority
of young women emancipating from

foster care are likely to be eligible for
Medicaid undereither the low-income
provision or the foster youth­specific
provision of the ACA in participating
states.20 Given the similar poverty
rates and lower insurance rates for
male former foster youth, these poli-
cies have the potential to affect young
men formerly in foster care in a similar
if not more profound manner.17,20
This study has several limitations. First,
outcomes were assessed by using
slightly different questions in the 2
studies, which could have led to dif-
ferences in classification across cohorts.
In particular, the language excluding
pregnancy-related hypertension and
diabetes in the Add Health cohorts
could have artificially inflated ORs
because these conditions were not
specifically excluded in the Midwest
Study. However, sensitivity analyses
removing young women ever pregnant
from all 3 cohorts and thus removing
this potential bias demonstrated sim-
ilar results. Second, although we ad-
justed for potential demographic and
socioeconomic confounding factors,
survey questions cannot completely
assess social determinants of health.
Thus, some degree of residual con-
foundingislikely.Third,someoutcomes
were rare, and we had suboptimal
power to detect significant differences
in these variables (eg, seizures). We
were also limited to a subset of health
outcomes measured in both studies;
future research should explore a wider
variety of health problems including
mental health and substance-related
disorders, which are among the most
common problems experienced by young
adults.35 Finally, variables were self-
report. This limitation may have re-
sulted in some misclassification of
outcomes, biasing point estimates to-
ward the null.
CONCLUSIONS

in young adulthood are evaluated and
implemented,6 and when state and
federal governing bodies are consid-
ering policies to extend Medicaid or
