Introduction
The asymmetrical ways in which productivity is distributed in
populations of all kinds are often examined in economics and
economic sociology to account for individual performance
inequalities, persistence, and reinforcement over time. This
descriptive article contributes to the literature explaining and
evaluating performance by emphasizing both individual and
organizational contexts intertwined. It proposes a new three-
level network approach to analyze cumulative advantage at
the individual, intra-organizational, and inter-organizational
levels. It uses a structural metaphor for this cumulative advan-
tage, the superposed wings of a paraglider, and builds around
this metaphor to explore the usefulness of extended networks
for understanding performance data as measured at the indi-
vidual level. It thus provides a new structural translation of
the kind of cumulative advantage that Merton (1968), in his
famous paper, called "Matthew effect."
The complexity of conceptualizing and analyzing the
Matthew effect has often been addressed by existing research.
Since Merton's seminal paper on how advantage begets fur-
ther advantage in science, the Matthew effect has been stud-
ied in many social situations in which populations fall behind
in terms of abilities (Rigney, 2010). A network analytical
perspective was developed by Price (1976; see also Mullins
et al., 1977) in his article on networks of scientific papers,
showing a preferential attachment mechanism among aggre-
gated journal­journal citation networks and expressing it as
a negatively exponential function, an approach further devel-
oped by statistical physicists following Barabási and Albert
(1999).Another example is Gould (2003) using transitivity to
explain this effect as concentration of status on specific
members: actors confer status on others when they perceive
The structural wings of Matthew effects:
The contribution of three-level network
data to the analysis of cumulative advantage

Abstract
The article presents a three-level network approach to the Matthew effect as a multilevel complement to Burt's (2005)
conception of the relationship between networks and performance. We first introduce a three-level dataset and the
specificity of this data structure for explorations of cumulative advantage. Second, we present a population of scientists
and provide a heuristic visualization--as "paragliders"--of their position in this multilevel structure. Third, we cluster these
actors into groups of performance to better understand who is in a multilevel position to make progress with performance
measurements over time. We use Ronald Burt's representation of the combined effect of brokerage beyond group and
closure within group to show that several of these performance groups do not follow his own principles very closely.
Fourth, we provide evidence, for one of these groups, of the usefulness of combining constraint in the personal network
of its members with constraint in their "extended" network--that is, for looking at the relationship between performance
and borrowing from "dual alters" in the extended network. This shows that, when it is present, network lift from three-
level structural wings is provided by different levels for different actors. Hypotheses induced by the paraglider metaphor can
thus be tested progressively to provide new understandings of the structural conditions under which the Matthew effect of
cumulative advantage operates. Finally, we list limitations of this three-level approach to the Matthew effect as examined here
and suggest further developments for this approach.

that their peers do the same. Snijders (2011) provides meas-
urements for this transitivity as an endogenous effect in his
analyses of relational turnover in longitudinal network data,
but defines the Matthew effect as self-reinforcing popularity
in such networks, thus using centrality for prominence that
increases over time.
The social science literature on the link between networks
and performance, however, is dominated by Burt's (1992,
2005, 2010) theory: performance increases when actors have
dense ties within their workgroup and high brokerage beyond
the group. Burt's work shows that members benefit from bro-
kerage and structural holes unless they are in a highly depend-
ent situation. In the latter case, they can try to borrow someone
else's (a champion's, a mentor's) relational capital to reach
the same levels of performance as their average competitors.
Borrowing social capital can be an efficient strategy for
members who suffer from a lack of legitimacy (e.g. women in
a male-dominated organization): it consists of benefiting
from a colleague's or a superior's support through a use of the
latter's network. Setting aside the case of such actors, who
are considered to be socially illegitimate ("not one of us") by
the majority of mainstream members, neighbor networks are
presented as relatively useless for performance (Burt, 2010).
In this article, our contribution is to propose an organiza-
tion-based approach to Burt's "borrowing" for which one
needs three levels of network data to measure an additional
dimension of the Matthew effect, that is, an effect based on
what Lazega et al. (2013) call an extended opportunity
structure. Here we are inspired by Breiger's (1974) theory of
duality, that is, of co-constitution of individuals and groups,
to provide an extra determinant of Matthew effects that are
inextricably individual and collective. We generalize Burt's
theory by assuming that all members (not only dominated
members considered socially illegitimate) of an organiza-
tion can borrow relational capital from other members
through indirect and affiliation ties in a multilevel context.
In our view, this is equivalent to "augmenting" individual
networks. Translated in Burt's terms, adding a third level of
analysis suggests that performance increases when an actor
has dense ties within group, high brokerage beyond the
group, and the opportunity to access an organizationally
augmented network.
Using this three-level approach to borrowing and perfor-
mance, we therefore argue that borrowing can be much more
widespread than previously assumed. By looking at the inter-
organizational context as well, via "expanded" or "org-aug-
mented" networks, we show that sharing relational capital
within one's organization and borrowing relational capital
from outside one's organization (via colleagues and bosses
or by using the name of one's organization) add to members'
performance. Because it brings into the picture "dual alters"
(potential contact accessible by closing a multilevel four-
cycle) and complementary resources, this three-level
approach helps understand rather invisible dimensions of the
Matthew effect. Indeed previous work has shown that when
focal actors' dual alters are rich in resources that are comple-
mentary to the resources of these focal actors, including
these dual alters in the model improves explanations of the
focal actors' performances and returns on organizational
investments. In other words, this inclusion of dual alters
reshapes members' opportunity structure.
Here, the analysis is carried out on a small population of
elite scientists in public research, the French field of onco-
logical research (1996­2005), whose production of knowl-
edge is recognized as efficient.All individuals are "sublime"
in terms of productivity, with four papers per semester pub-
lished in internationally visible journals over five successive
semesters. Cumulative advantage mechanisms can be seen
as a mix of economic and social mechanisms, in the sense
that scientists who participate in the production of a suc-
cessful publication are rewarded by obtaining resources that
help them carry on with research, such as funding, free time,
stimulating laboratories, talented students (Allison et al.,
1982) that, in turn, help them win "scientific tournaments"
in which the winner (the first to publish a result) takes all.
But these scientists are also, as identified by Merton (1968,
1973), recognized by colleagues in terms of citations and
reputation that go to already well-known researchers who
can thus build a dominant position in their specialty and
impose their "scientific orthodoxies" (Mulkay, 1972)--
whereas unnoticed researchers accumulate obstacles and
often end up exiting the system.
This gives a chance to combined individual and organi-
zational network dimensions of productivity to become vis-
ible. Since Lotka (1926), productivity of scientists is known
to have a very asymmetrical distribution with a minority of
very prolific scientists and a majority of scientists with a
much smaller contribution to the publications in any single
domain. This asymmetry reflects a hierarchy in terms of
productivity and this hierarchy is known to be not only per-
sistent over time but also self-reinforcing, with amplifica-
tion of inequalities within a given generation of researchers.
This is especially the case when these patterns are com-
bined with individual skills and strategies, and with organi-
zational dimensions of scientific activities. For example,
Bellotti (2012) shows that being in a brokerage position is
extremely important for getting funding. Lazega et al.
(2008, 2013) show that the centrality of the researcher in
their peer networks and the centrality and size of the labo-
ratories in which these researchers are affiliated can be
combined elements of a structural explanation of scientific
performance over time.
The "paragliding" visualization of cumulative advantage
that we propose for the superposed levels of collective
agency is based on a complex combination of these three
kinds of network measurements, which is how it captures
some of the multilevel relational processes producing
together a meso-level Matthew effect. With the data structure
represented by this paragliding metaphor, we account for
variance unexplained by Burt's model. The characteristics
Lazega and Jourda 3
that make the potential networks (i.e. top surface of the para-
glider) ascending or crashing is the specific constraint that
they exercise on the individual researcher and the high or
strong complementarity of resources that researchers can
access through them (Lazega et al., 2013).
This three-level dataset includes and combines inter-labo-
ratory networks, inter-individual networks within a specific
subpopulation of scientists in that field, egocentric networks,
and performance variations (impact factor (IF) scores associ-
ated with these researchers' publications) as measured at the
individual level. Thus, network paragliders allow sociolo-
gists to measure the extent to which individual scientists'
performance depends on the characteristics of the adminis-
trative unit in which they belong, on their position in the sys-
tem of collective action in which they both cooperate and
compete, and on the structure and composition of their per-
sonalized ego-network of collaborators. This unexplored
dimension of cumulative advantage is thus based on effects
that are a combination of individual, organization and `indus-
try level effects.
The article is structured as follows. We first present our
three-level dataset and the specificity of the data structure
that we use to explore cumulative advantage. Second, we
provide a heuristic visualization of the combination of levels
as paragliders. Third, we cluster the scientists into groups of
performance to better understand who is in a multilevel posi-
tion to make progress with performance measurements over
time. We use Burt's representation of the combined effect of
brokerage beyond group and closure within group to show
that several of these performance groups do not follow his
own principles very closely. Fourth, we provide evidence,
for one of these groups, of the usefulness of combining con-
straint in the personal network of individuals and in their
extended network, that is, for looking at the relationship
between borrowing from dual alters and performance.
Finally, we list current limitations of this three-level approach
to the Matthew effect as examined here.
A three-level network dataset
The following section briefly describes the manner in which
we selected the population, collected the data, and studied
this milieu.
Population and data
Members of this population were identified by the number of
articles published in scientific journals between 1996 and
1998. The numbers are based on the Cancerlit database of the
US National Library of Medicine. The criterion used was a
threshold of 25 papers over the period of 2.5 years. The list
of scientists selected based on this criterion includes differ-
ent types of actors: those who publish heavily, those who
co-publish heavily, and those who are present in the list of
authors because they provide technical help, or because they
run the laboratory. Following "Lotka's law" (Lotka, 1926),
the vast majority of researchers working on a specific prob-
lem only publish one article about the problem. A very small,
but more prolific minority of scientists publish the majority
of their articles in a specific domain. In this list, we selected
precisely those who, while based in France, had published
the most (including in international journals) in cancer
research during this period.
Selecting these scientists who are already at the top of
their field to study who becomes highly productive through
cumulative advantage may seem paradoxical. A different
sample including much less productive scientists would have
provided more variation in productivity. However, we found
that there was already enough variability in this population
of "sublime" scientists to explore the issue of cumulative
advantage. Even the scientists and laboratories with lower
performance scores are still more elite than other French can-
cer researchers at the time. This should not matter for the
development of the method and its potential uses because the
selection criterion and the list of names used in the study do
not eliminate differences between the most productive and
successful cancer researchers.
The sample was reduced to the first 168 researchers
because this number represents all of the scientists who met
the 25+ publications criterion. The construction of the meas-
ure of actors' performance is based on the IF of the journals
in which each researcher has published. IF scores are limited
as measurements of performance and they have long been
criticized by information scientists and sociologists (Fox,
1983; Gingras, 2014; Long, 1978; Mulkay, 1972; Reskin,
1977; Seglen, 1992, 1997). In particular, IFs change over
time. We therefore used them based on the year when a sci-
entist published in the journal. All IF scores were computed
using the same database, that is, PubMed in which Cancerlit
was merged. The correlation between the number of publica-
tions and the IF scores of the individual's publications is
0.37. The score was calculated for publications with multiple
co-authors in the following way. If a researcher published
four articles in a journal, the IF score of that journal was
multiplied by 4. IF scores of all publications were summed
for each individual. We did not take into account the fact that
a researcher was publishing alone or in a team: each person
mentioned as a co-author received the same score. We could
have divided the score by the number of co-authors, but this
procedure seemed even more problematic than our proce-
dure since we did not have any information about who did
what for each paper. The researchers in the population
received the full IF even if they were co-author #10 on a
team of 15, not a fraction based on their rank and the size of
the team.
Among the 168 researchers, 128 persons (76%) accepted
an interview. Few central names are missing from our net-
work. Most of the researchers who declined to be interviewed
were rarely, if ever, selected from the list of names that was
presented to the participants who did agree to be interviewed.
4 Methodological Innovations
Their indegree centralities were very low in the relational
networks of their French colleagues. We determined that few
important names were missing by showing the list of those
missing to several researchers who were reinterviewed after
fieldwork, as well as to the cancerologists on the board of the
non-profit organization that funded this research. Despite
meeting the formal criterion to be included in the population,
most were at the periphery of this network.
Following the strategy of structural linked design, we
tried to interview all the directors of the laboratories to which
these researchers belonged. In total, we interviewed (face-to-
face) 82 laboratory directors in the system of French cancer
research. In 51 of the 128 cases, the selected researcher is
also the director of his/her laboratory; these persons agreed
to two interviews (one as a researcher, one as a laboratory
director) and responded to the two questionnaires. Insofar as,
for various reasons, some directors of laboratory were inter-
viewed but not the researcher in their laboratory, or the
researcher but not the director, we are left with 93 researcher/
director "pairs." Thus, the number of researchers that we are
able, thanks to the structural linked design, to position in the
dual system of superposed interdependencies is finally 93.
All further network results at either level refer to the net-
works formed by these 93 pairs.
Data structure for network measurement and
visualization of cumulative advantage
Next, the multilevel networks of interdependencies in France
in 1999 were reconstituted. First, the inter-organizational
networks between the majority of laboratories involved in
cancer research; second, the advice networks constructed by
the members of the "elite." This was done in the following
manner. At the individual level, each researcher is consid-
ered a "scientific entrepreneur" who needs resources that
may be social or financial. From the individual researcher's
point of view, research may be analytically broken down into
five steps: selecting a line of research, finding institutional
support, finding sources of financing, recruiting personnel,
and publishing articles. The five steps were identified based
on ethnographic work with the researchers and discussion of
where they really thought they needed advice. At each step,
the researchers depend upon their relational capital and seek
advice from other members of the research community in
order to handle these uncertainties. In this competitive envi-
ronment, access to advisors is an important resource because
carrying out these tasks is facilitated by access to advice
offered by competent colleagues who agree to help.
Scientific work was thus reduced analytically to a
sequence of five non-routine tasks, each one characterized
by a strong degree of uncertainty. The assumption that
researchers follow five sequential steps, beginning with
selecting a line of research and ending with publication,
seems very simplified. This process is often not linear or
rational. For example, researchers often choose their research
questions on the basis of available funding. While this is a
simplification, it provides quite a complex view of the pro-
cess in terms of networks. A different advice network was
collected at each step, which was hard work for the inter-
viewees. In addition, these steps are used here purely analyti-
cally and we do not carry out any sequential analysis. Indeed,
in the analyses below, we aggregate the five advice networks
to derive our network variables.
In order to reconstitute the resulting system of interde-
pendencies among actors at the inter-individual level (within
the elite), we asked the actors to identify those from whom,
in the list of the 168 cancer researchers presented to them,
they sought advice to handle these challenges at each step. It
was thus possible to reconstitute one advice network per
step: one network dealing with choices about the direction of
projects, one for helping to find institutional support, one for
handling financial resources, one helping with recruitment,
and finally one network of colleagues to whom researchers
send their manuscripts for advice before submitting them to
journals. Other data were also collected about the researchers
themselves: their attributes, their performances, and their
opinions in several domains. Finally, each individual
researcher was asked about the composition of his/her imme-
diate workgroup, that is, collaboration ego-network, and
about ties among the members of this workgroup, as in Burt
(1992).
At the inter-organizational level, we also collected sys-
tematic data about inter-laboratory networks and about labo-
ratory characteristics. Whereas talent is everywhere, a
longstanding challenge for smaller laboratories and their
researchers has been poor access to various kinds of
resources. All in this system, including researchers in small
laboratories, must rely on informal access through personal-
ized relationships, which does not help level the competitive
field. Some are shut out from the circuits of tacit knowledge,
the exchange of which is socially and strategically driven,
which highly benefits the larger organizations.
The laboratory directors indicated with which other labo-
ratories, among those practicing cancer research in France,
their laboratory exchanged different types of resources. The
list of reconstituted transfers and exchanges includes recruit-
ment of post-docs and researchers, development of programs
of joint research, joint responses to tender offers, sharing of
technical equipment, sharing of experimental material,
mobility of administrative personnel, and invitations to con-
ferences and seminars. The complete inter-organizational
network examined here is the aggregated and dichotomized
network of all these flows. Dichotomization created a tie
between two individuals or organizations if there was at least
one tie between them in one of the aggregated matrices.
To summarize, at the inter-individual level, five advice
networks are aggregated and dichotomized to reconstitute a
complete network density of 0.06 with average degree of
8.8. In this network, the reciprocation rate is 0.36. Likewise,
the inter-organizational network reaches a density of 0.04
Lazega and Jourda 5
with average degree of 6; the reciprocation rate is 0.39. This
shows strong relational activity in this system, at both
levels. Collaboration ego-networks, which can be considered
to be intermediary-level relational infrastructures (Lazega,
2016), were used to compute 128 aggregate constraints
measurements (Burt, 1992).1 The reconstitution of this com-
plex system of interdependencies at three levels of collec-
tive agency provides a realistic specification of multilevel
sources of productivity. It also provides a basis for a struc-
tural explanation of cumulative advantage and performance
measured at the individual level. Figure 1 represents the
three levels of network data in the same space.
Performance measured at the individual level, but pro-
duced by the supporting organization in which the individual
belongs, makes obvious sense in the life of scientific
researchers. At each step of their work, laboratories provide
their members with economic, social, and technical resources.
For example, when a new researcher arrives in a laboratory,
he or she benefits from established cooperative relationships
between the laboratory and other laboratories, and also from
the reputation and sometimes the networks of its director.
Regular institutional budgets and funds raised for specific
scientific projects represent obvious causal factors for per-
formance measured at the individual level and, in the end, for
obtaining high IF scores. Therefore, performance may simul-
taneously depend on the characteristics of the laboratory,
including its position in the network of exchanges between
laboratories, and on the characteristics of individuals, includ-
ing their positions in the network of exchanges between
them. Likewise, performance may depend on the combined
structural characteristics of the laboratory and the researcher
because their interdependencies are based on the comple-
mentary nature of resources provided by each level. In addi-
tion, the composition and structure of teams working with
these researchers also matter in explaining performance
measured at the individual level.
Figure 1. Multilevel network data structure for visualization of cumulative advantage.
Based on the data collected in this project, each researcher in the dataset has four types of networks. A first network of advisors composed of alters that
are his/her own personal contacts among the other researchers in the observed population at the time of fieldwork. These contacts are represented as
blue dots. A second network of alters that are both his/her contacts and that of his/her laboratory because they belong to laboratories with which his/her
own laboratory has exchanges of several types of inter-organizational resources. These contacts, who are common to the researcher and his/her laboratory,
are represented as blue dots above a pink rectangle. A third network of dual alters who can be reached by ego through inter-organizational ties between
ego's laboratory and alter's laboratory. These dual alters are accessible through the inter-organizational network but who are not yet accessed by ego.
They are represented as pink rectangles. Finally, each researcher has a team of close collaborators that is represented as an ego-network in green. There
is no overlap in this dataset between this team and the direct contacts among the other members of this population of scientists.
6 Methodological Innovations
Finally, the combination of such levels can also have spe-
cific cross-level effects. For example, a latent and expanded
network built on multiplex and multilevel ties can account
for part of performance measured at the individual level.
This is what we call organizational augmentation of individ-
ual performance based on his/her "extended" opportunity
structure (Lazega et al., 2013). This adds a multiplex dimen-
sion to multilevel positioning through linked design,
suggesting the notion of a latent and expanded network in
which both the nodes and the edges are nested within organi-
zational units, but the ties can be among nodes of different
organizational units. Actors have a complex inter-individual
network at the personal level combined with an inter-organi-
zational network at the collective level. The latter is based on
affiliation ties or personal ties with colleagues or managers
(hierarchical superiors) who themselves have ties in other

organizations. We simply add the two networks and treat the
"augmented" network as a latent structure mixing "actual"
and "potential" relational capital. As shown in Figure 2, this
organizationally augmented network is constructed by add-
ing to an observed network of actors i all the potential ties to
actors k that i can access through their manager and through
the manager's ties to other managers at the inter-organiza-
tional level. We assume that this potential can be more easily
realized by individual actors than creation of new ties, pro-
vided that members and managers get along reasonably well
in terms of cooperation in their organization.
Of course, managers' ties do not represent all the rela-
tional possibilities offered by the organization; peers can also
broker ties to new contacts. All researchers do not benefit in
the same way from potential ties. However, sharing rela-
tional capital is part of a manager's job (at least in theory)
and including this potential represents an additional dimen-
sion of network measurements of status. It is equivalent to a
multilevel use of Burt's concept of "borrowing" social capi-
tal. Lazega et al. (2013) provide a multilevel analysis where
performance at time 1 interacts with network variables to
generate even greater performance in time 2.
Scientists as network paragliders and
network lift
This three-level structure based on the organizationally aug-
mented latent network can be represented by a figure that looks
like a multilevel paraglider. In this figure, actors are character-
ized by the three superposed networks: a personal network at
the intra-organizational level is located at the bottom of the
parachute; an observed inter-individual network at the inter-
organizational level is located at the middle of the parachute;
the augmented or expanded inter-individual network at the
inter-organizational level is located at the top of the parachute.
The paragliding metaphor points to variance unexplained by
Burt's model of structural advantage based exclusively on bro-
kerage and closure in the network of direct ties.
We distinguish two kinds of paragliders: ascending and
crashing. The characteristics that make the augmented net-
works (i.e. top surface of the paraglider) ascending or crash-
ing is the specific constraint that they exercise on the
individual researcher and the high or strong complementarity
of resources that researchers can access through them
(Lazega et al., 2013). In the first situation, as represented in
Figure 3, the org-augmented network helps individual mem-
bers increase their performance; in this situation, borrowing
relational capital helps when centrality provides resources,
neighbors provide complementary resources, and the ego-
network is capable of collective action. In Figure 4, the org-
augmented network has a negative effect on performance as
measured at the individual level; borrowing relational capital
detracts from performance when a peripheral position
decreases access to resources, dual alters provide "more of
the same" resources, and one's ego-network is not capable of
collective action. In this situation, borrowing represents a
handicap in terms of performance and we therefore call this
a crashing paraglider.
This multilevel network visualization is a representation of
position and status as superposed structural wings. It is heu-
ristic because it shows the contribution of multiple and super-
posed levels of collective agency to the very definition of
status. Of course, hierarchy is one component of status in that
respect, but not the only one, as outlined in the introduction.
The superposition of forms of collective agency is also a mat-
ter of affiliation and membership, not only of hierarchy.
Exploring cumulative advantage in
complex multilevel effects
A simplified measurement of performance (increasing or
decreasing) provides insufficient responses to the question of
what accounts for this performance when explanatory factors
include dual positioning and strategy (Lazega et al., 2008).
In order to enrich these explanations, we cluster researchers
in terms of specialties and in terms of performance levels
over time.
Clustering researchers into performance groups
Analyzing performances at the individual level for all
researchers in the population provides six categories of such
performances over 10
years. In order to better explain
Figure 4. "Crashing" paraglider.
8 Methodological Innovations
performances, we calculated for each researcher: (1) his/her
yearly IF score between 1996 and 2005 and his/her yearly
position compared to the average annual performance of all
researchers, and (2) the evolution of this IF score compared to
the evolution of this mean during the first (1996­2000) and
the second (2001­2005) periods. Based on these indexes,
researchers were clustered into one of the six "IF career"
groups. Figure 5 visualizes the evolution of performances for
each performance group. Clustering was performed by group-
ing the researchers with similar trajectories. We looked at
whose performance was stable, increasing, or decreasing over
time and compared to the overall mean at each point in time.
Clustering researchers in groups of performance helps in
understanding who is in a multilevel position to make pro-
gress with IF scores over time. Figure 5 presents these evolu-
tions for the six groups of performance identified by this
analysis. Group 1, the "top of the top" in terms of perfor-
mance, are always above average and progressing towards
the top. Group 2 are also above average during the two peri-
ods, but they do not make much progress over time. Group 4's
performances decrease: they start above the mean in Period 1
and are below in Period 2. Group 3 start below the mean in
Period 1 but are in the amazing position of trying to catch up
with Group 1 in the second period. Group 5, although below
the mean in both periods, make progress during the second
period. Group 6 performances are below the mean in Period 1
and decrease even further during Period 2.
As already mentioned, Burt's (2005) theory argues that
performance increases when actors have dense ties within
their workgroup and high brokerage beyond the group. This
is represented in Figure 6.

Lazega and Jourda 9
This type of visualization focuses on the relation between
constraints and the evolution of performance. Stagnating
performances are located at the bottom; improving perfor-
mances are located at the top, and in between evolutions in
an intermediary position. Except for members who are often
ostracized as not being "one of us" and who are in a highly
dependent situation,2 this picture suggests that performance
should reach a maximal value represented by the A letter
when brokerage beyond group and closure within group are
at their highest levels. Following this argument, we map
the two values for each of the six groups of performance
observed in this population of scientists based on the average
constraint in the ego-network of collaborators and the aver-
age number of structural holes in the observed network. As
expected from Figures 5 and 6, cumulating the right values
for the two sources of performance produces cumulative
advantage akin to a meso-level Matthew effect only for two
groups (performance groups 1 and 3).
In Figure 7, we make these outcomes comparable, thus
showing how constraint along one dimension varies with
constraint along the other dimension. Adding this informa-
tion on the 3D visualization, we can check the position of
each performance group compared to Burt's A, B, C, and D
performance points in Figure 6. This shows that the two
groups that increase their performance the most during the
second period are performance groups 1 and 3. Both are well
positioned on Burt's graph, although far from the strongest
performances predicted by his theoretical platform. Group 2
is closest to the lowest performances. Groups 4 (- -) and 5
(+ +) would have intermediary performances on average.
In short, when averaged within groups of performance, sci-
entific outcomes do not follow Burt's principles very closely
at the beginning of Period 1 and based on the observed net-
work (i.e. without borrowing). But this nevertheless supports
the idea that the good position of Group 1 is caused by the
configurations of both of these networks. The strong network
constraint within group and weak constraint beyond group for
both Groups 1 and 3 are stepping stones for future higher per-
formance, that is, over time. The lowest position (intermediary
in D) of researchers of Group 4 could be a cause for the strong
decrease in their performance during the second period (they
start above the overall mean during Period 1 and end up below
the mean during Period 2). The same is true for Group 5 except
that its modest increase remains below the mean. Groups 2
and 6 stagnate the most, whether above or below the overall
mean, and are closest to Burt's point C.

groups at the end of Period 1.
10 Methodological Innovations
Based on averages computed for each performance group,
Group 3 is the closest to the point representing high perfor-
mance in this type of visualization and Group 2 is closest to
the lowest, with Groups 4 and 5 displaying average perfor-
mances. This visualization confirms the good position of the
groups that increase their performances over time, including
the catchers up, who are located close to the "right" places in
Burt's terms. It is more difficult to provide a straightforward
explanation for the position of Group 4 in D and Group 5 in
B. Is it an explanation for Group 4's important slump in the
second period? Of the modest catching up by Group 5 in the
second period given its low performances in the first? Groups
2 and 6, being groups with stagnating performances, whether
with high performances or with low ones, are both located
close to point C.
Having identified members who both have constraining
work groups and who are brokers beyond their group, we
realize that, although Burt's approach is confirmed for some
performance groups, it is not confirmed for others. Constraint
levels in both networks seem to play a clear role for some
groups, facilitating cumulative advantage for Groups 1 and
3, but not for the others. This is where we propose to add,
based on our paragliders' heuristic, another possible meas-
urement of cumulative advantage: a measurement of inter-
organizational network lift. The purpose of introducing this
measurement is to show that what was left unexplained by
Burt's approach can be explained by the same measurements
but in the extended network constructed on borrowing. In
effect, we argued above that the position of the individual's
organization in the inter-organizational context of this indus-
try can provide additional and different resources for cumu-
lative advantage and performance. The inter-organizational
context of the organization in which actors operate has been
recognized by the literature as an important context. Here,
we combine both approaches. We do so in two complemen-
tary ways. We first show that brokerage beyond the group is
improved for most performance groups by its measurement
in the extended network, that is, the network including poten-
tial ties (dual alters) reached through tetradic substructures.
Second, we then focus on the nature of the resources that can
be reached through potential ties, in particular their relative
utility and complementarity with respect to resources that
actors already have in their observed network.
Rich-get-richer through borrowing
from the organization and access to
dual alters
This unexplored dimension of cumulative advantage is based
on effects that are a combination of individual and organiza-
tional level effects. The interesting aspect of these results is
that they confirm Breiger's theory of duality, that is, of co-
constitution of individuals and groups, thus providing an
extra determinant of Matthew effects that are unextricably
individual and collective.
Two groups of researchers are of particular interest for
illustrating our point. Group 1 of top performers with an
ascending paraglider, and Group 4 of lower level performers
with a crashing paraglider. When comparing brokerage, con-
straints, and performances in the observed networks (as in
Burt) with the same measurements in the expanded networks,
we obtain the following results.As represented in Figure 8(a)
and (b), Group 1 comparison shows that borrowing increases
brokerage and helps with performance: this confirms the
existence of a Matthew effect but only for the haves. The
more the researchers who are already top performers borrow
complementary resources from their neighbors, the higher
their performance is likely to become. In contrast, as repre-
sented in Figure 9(a) and (b), for members of Group 4, the
have-nots, whose performances decrease over time, borrow-
ing does not increase performance. The extended network
has a different effect here. Within this group, performances
of researchers do not react positively to variations in con-
straint in both networks: the expanded advice network wors-
ens their performance.
Using structural wings for measurement of cumulative
advantage combining two levels of the paraglider (constraint
in the personal network and in the observed network) seems
to be a good method for understanding and explaining pro-
ductivity and status of some categories of actors in the social
setting. Combining two other levels (constraint in the per-
sonal network and in the extended network) provides a good
method for understanding and explaining productivity and
status of other categories of actors. This suggests that differ-
entiating the input (complementary vs. redundant resources)
in observed networks from potential resources coming from
direct or dual neighbors provides a better understanding of
variations in cumulative advantage. When it is present, net-
work lift from three-level structural wings is provided by dif-
ferent levels for different actors. Hypotheses induced by the
paraglider metaphor can thus be tested progressively to pro-
vide new understandings of the structural conditions under
which the Matthew effect of cumulative advantage operates.
"More of the same" can be useful in this context. Burt was
primarily concerned with information and knowledge from
diverse ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage provides
a "vision advantage" that individuals can profit from. In
Burt's case, closure, and by extension having "more of the
same thing," is suboptimal because it insulates the focal
actor from new ideas. Still, Burt argued that closure also has
benefits, such as helping to build trust and get things done.
There are some advantages to be gained from "more of the
same" in the advice networks in our population. The main
justification for constructing advice networks is that they
help scientists and directors make decisions in conditions of
uncertainty at multiple stages of the research process.
Obviously there are benefits to having more information. But
the benefits of closure include trust, capacity of mobiliza-
tion, and homogeneous advice, which makes it easier to act
decisively. Being in brokerage positions might maximize
Lazega and Jourda 11
new information, but it might also result in contradictory
advice and low levels of trust. This could have negative
influences on performance in conditions of uncertainty.
However, in our case, the specificity of our dataset
tends to underscore the value of complementary resources.
Empirical results show precisely that the value of closure
varies with the kind of group, that is, with the level of perfor-
mance. Thus, there is value in using three-level data and in
looking at how dual alters are likely to increase focal actors'
performance by modifying their opportunity structures.
Conclusion
This study examined the Matthew effect (the strong get
stronger, the weak stay weak or become weaker) with a
sample of highly productive cancer researchers from France
among whom strong differences exist in terms of per-
formance as measured at the individual level. We used
multilevel network data through linked design to further
explore the articulation of teams, inter-individual and inter-
organizational networks of scientists. We proposed that a
three-level "paragliding" visualization of cumulative advan-
tage based on a complex combination of different network
measurements has heuristic value as the "structural wings"
of cumulative advantage. Exploratory analyses of such
data show that this visualization captures some of the com-
plex relational processes producing together a meso-level
Matthew effect.
We outlined this three-level network approach to the
Matthew effect as a multilevel complement to Burt's
approach of the relationship between position in networks
and performance. The specificity of the data structure (com-
bination of levels) that we use to explore cumulative advan-
tage was visualized as paragliders. We then clustered the
scientists whom we interviewed into groups of performance
to better understand who was in a multilevel position to make
progress with performance measurements over time. We
used Burt's representation of the combined effect of broker-
age beyond group and closure within group to show that sev-
eral of these performance groups do not follow his principles
very closely. We provided evidence, for one of these groups,
of the usefulness of combining constraint in the personal net-
work of individuals and in their extended network, that is, for
looking at the relationship between borrowing relational
capital from the organization (and reaching dual alters in the
expanded network) and performance. This showed that,

In Group 1, comparisons carried out at the end of Period 1 show that borrowing increases brokerage and will help with performance during Period 2.

when it is present, network lift from three-level structural
wings is provided by different levels for different actors.
Hypotheses induced by the paraglider metaphor can thus be
tested progressively to provide new understandings of the
structural conditions under which the Matthew effect of
cumulative advantage works.
As presented here, this three-level perspective on the
Matthew effect has several limitations that should be dealt
with in further explorations of this approach to cumulative
advantage. Future studies will need a more inclusive and
comparative selection criteria for the population to test this
method for a larger sample of researchers including research-
ers with lower productivity as measured at the individual
level. Adjustments need also to be made for cases where an
actor was both a researcher and a laboratory director, and
therefore belonged to two sets of actors. In addition, effects
identified here should be more systematically tested using
multilevel exponential random graph models (ERGMs)
(Wang et al., 2013). In that respect, much remains to be done.
Productivity and performance are strong preoccupations
in the organizational society and in economies dominated by
the capacity of hierarchical superiors to expose subordinates
and people below them in social stratification to increasingly
open competition. This multilevel approach to performance
questions in many ways the capacity of hierarchical superi-
ors to overcome vertical competition with their subordinates
to improve these subordinates' performance by helping them
in reaching the right dual alters. Our results suggest that
more research is needed on managerial behavior, responsi-
bility, and contribution to collective performance that is less
focused on decision making (as it was during the past four
generations), and more on relational abilities and strategies,
for example on help for subordinates to borrow from the
social capital of the organization, even if this capital is in part
the managers' own relational capital.

Notes
1. Burt's (1992: 54) measurement of constraint is an aggregate
constraint based on this equation: C
=
J
(PIJ
+Q
PIQ
PQJ
)2,
QI, J. In this equation, PQJ
is the proportional strength of Q's
relationship with J and PIJ
is the proportional strength of I's
relations with J. C is the sum of constraints exercised on I by
each of I's direct contacts plus the latter's indirect constraints.
2. For example, women in a men's world, minorities in a major-
ity's world, who need to borrow someone else's relational
capital (a champion's, a mentor's) to reach the same levels
of performance as members of the dominant category (Burt,
1992).
