ABSTRACT
Background: Alcohol may affect dietary intake. However, little is
known about diets on drinking days in the US population.
Objective: We determined whether the diets of drinkers differ on
drinking compared with nondrinking days.
Design: Data were from the 2003­2008 NHANES Mobile Exami-
nation Center interview. We identified 1864 current drinkers (1126
men and 738 women) who completed two 24-h dietary recalls, one
of which was on a drinking day and the other of which was on
a nondrinking day. Sex-specific repeated-measures analyses that
were adjusted for dietary recall order and recall day of the week
were used to compare within-individual differences in energy, nu-
trient, and food-group intakes. Analyses were weighted to produce
representative estimates.
Results: On their drinking (compared with nondrinking) days, men
consumed an excess 168 nonalcohol kcal (P , 0.01), which was
reflected in higher intakes of nutrients including total protein (P ,
0.001), total fat (P , 0.01), saturated fat (P , 0.01), monounsatu-
rated fat (P , 0.01), potassium (P , 0.001), and sodium (P ,
0.05). Men also had higher intakes of food groups including meat
(P , 0.001), white potatoes (P , 0.05), and discretionary oil and
solid fat (P , 0.05) and lower intakes of total fruit (P , 0.05) and
milk (P , 0.05). Women did not consume excess nonalcohol kilo-
calories but had higher intakes of total fat (P , 0.05), monounsat-
urated fat (P , 0.05), polyunsaturated fat (P , 0.05), potassium
(P , 0.01), and discretionary oil and solid fat (P , 0.05) and lower
intakes of milk (P , 0.01) and milk products (P , 0.01).
Conclusions: These mostly moderate drinkers had poorer diets on
drinking days. Same-day associations between alcohol and diet
could be useful targets for public health efforts to improve dietary
intake. Am J Clin Nutr 2013;97:1068­75.
INTRODUCTION
Alcohol, which is a macronutrient that supplies 7 kcal/g, is
consumed by 70% of US adults (1) and contributes 4.8% of the
population's total energy intake (2). The high prevalence of
obesity in the United States (3) has led to concern about the
potential effect of alcohol on dietary intake. However, little is
known about diets of drinkers on days that they drink because
suitable population-level epidemiologic data have not been
available to explore the relation.
Whether alcohol is associated with same-day diet is an im-
portant and considerably different question than that posed by
previous epidemiologic studies (4­14) and a clinical trial (15)
that investigated whether usual alcohol consumption averaged
over days to a year was associated with diet. Same-day effects of
alcohol on diet are biologically plausible. Alcohol acutely sup-
presses fatty acid oxidation, increases short-term thermogenesis,
and affects food-related hormones and neurotransmitters in-
cluding leptin, serotonin, and neuropeptide Y (16). In terms of
public health messages, same-day associations between alcohol
and diet could be useful targets for efforts to improve dietary
intake.
Several human experimental studies have reported that
moderate alcohol consumption increased same-day nonalcohol
energy intake (4, 16­22). These studies typically administered an
alcohol preload before or with lunch. Food intake was imme-
diately stimulated, and the effect lasted w1­2 h. In 2 studies
(17, 18), energy intake was not sufficiently reduced during the
remainder of the day to completely compensate for the excess
alcohol and food consumed; however, in one study (17), excess
energy intake was compensated for by a reduced intake on the
subsequent day. These experimental studies provided little in-
formation about the association of alcohol with nutrient or food-
group intakes because food choices were limited, and it was not
their purpose.
It would be possible to compare dietary intake on drinking
compared with nondrinking days within individuals in the US
population if an epidemiologic study included repeated measures
of alcohol and diet. The advantage of repeated measures is that
each person acts as his or her own control (ie, each person is
matched to himself or herself), which removes confounding as
a result of individual-level characteristics both observable (eg,
demographics and lifestyle) and unobservable (eg, genetics and
environment). The 2003­2008 NHANES included two 24-h

recalls that were obtained generally 3­10 d apart and provided
an opportunity for such an analysis. We used these recalls to
examine diets of 1864 current drinkers who consumed alcohol
on one of the 24-h recalls but not the other.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Survey
Our study used combined data from NHANES conducted in
2003­2004, 2005­2006, and 2007­2008. NHANES, which is
conducted by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, is
a continuing cross-sectional nationally representative survey of
the health and nutrition of the US noninstitutionalized civilian
population (23). NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multistage
probability sample design. The survey includes an in-person
visit to a mobile exam center (MEC) where participants receive
a health examination and are asked interviewer-administered
questions on several topics including alcohol use and dietary
intake. Unweighted response rates for the MEC sample were
76% in 2003­2004 (24); 77% in 2005­2006 (25); and 75% in
2007­2008 (26).
Alcohol consumption assessment
During the MEC visit, adults aged $20 y are asked about
usual alcohol consumption over their lifetime as follows: "In any
one year, have you had at least 12 drinks of any type of alcoholic
beverage?"; "In your entire life, have you had at least 12 drinks
of any type of alcoholic beverage?"; "In the past 12 months, how
often did you drink any type of alcoholic beverage?"; and "In
the past 12 months, on those days that you drank alcoholic
beverages, on the average how many drinks did you have?" (27).
Individuals were considered current drinkers if they consumed
$12 drinks in their entire life and drank on $1 d in the past
year. In women, light drinking was defined as #3 drinks/wk,
moderate drinking was defined as .3­7 drinks/wk, and heavier
drinking was defined as .7 drinks/wk; in men, corresponding
ranges were #3, .3­14, and .14 drinks/wk, respectively.
Dietary assessment
The MEC visit includes an interviewer-administered dietary
recall that uses the USDA Automated Multiple-Pass Method (28)
to estimate all foods and beverages (including alcohol) consumed
during the 24-h period before the interview (midnight to midnight)
(29). On completion of the recall, participants are scheduled for
a second recall to be administered by telephone 3­10 d later on
a different day of the week. Intakes available from recalls include
total energy, total protein, total carbohydrate, total fat, saturated,
monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fats, dietary fiber, calcium,
potassium, sodium, and alcohol. We estimated energy from
alcohol as
Alcohol (g) 3 6.93 ð1Þ
We estimated nonalcohol energy in alcoholic beverages as
follows: we identified all alcoholic beverages by using USDA
food codes 931XXXXX to 935XXXXX [except 93401300 (wine
used in cooking)], determined the total energy contribution of
each, and subtracted energy from alcohol.
The 24-h recall data were used to estimate intakes of
MyPyramid food groups by merging the data with the USDA
MyPyramid Equivalents Database, which specifies food groups
on the basis of US Dietary Guidelines (30, 31). The MyPyramid
Equivalents Database contains 32 major food groups (eg, total
grain and total vegetables) and subgroups (eg, whole grains); we
reduced the number to 21 by retaining all major groups and
combining several subgroups on the basis of their nutritional
characteristics.
Dietary outcomes
Our dependent variables of interest were intakes of total energy,
nonalcohol energy, macronutrients [total protein, total carbo-
hydrate, total fat, and subtypes (saturated, monounsaturated,
and polyunsaturated fats)], dietary fiber, and calcium as well as
intakes of potassium and sodium. When energy intakes were
calculated, we used the following definitions:
Alcohol = ethanol ð2Þ
Alcoholic beverages ¼ ethanol þ naturally occurring
macronutrients in the beverage ðeg; carbohydrates in beerÞ
þ mixers ð3Þ
Total nonalcohol energy ¼ total energy
2 energy from ethanol
ð4Þ
Study design and sample
The study used a repeated-measures analysis to estimate
within-individual changes in dietary and nutrient intakes of
current drinkers who consumed alcohol on one dietary recall day
(drinking day) but not the other (nondrinking day).
To obtain an appropriate sample, we first identified all re-
spondents who completed MEC interviews in NHANES 2003­
2004, 2005­2006, and 2007­2008. Of 29,355 respondents who
completed interviews, we excluded 14,133 individuals who were
,20 y of age followed by 116 individuals who were breast-
feeding, 591 individuals who were pregnant, 809 individuals
whose diet recalls on both days were not reliable or not avail-
able, 1454 individuals with only a single dietary recall, and 4848
individuals who were not current drinkers in the past year or
whose drinking status was unknown. We excluded 924 men and
374 women who consumed alcoholic beverages on both dietary
recall days and 2028 men and 2214 women who did not consume
alcoholic beverages on either dietary recall day. The remaining
1126 men and 738 women consumed alcoholic beverages on one
dietary recall day but not the other; these individuals comprised
our analytic sample.
In our analyses, covariates were dietary recall order [ie,
whether the first (in-person interview) or second (telephone)
recall was a nondrinking day or drinking day] and recall day of

the week. The season was considered by using 6-mo segments,
which was the only variable available in the dataset.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were weighted by 2-d dietary recall sample
weights. All analyses were sex specific. For demographic, life-
style, and dietary recall characteristics, unadjusted percentage
distributions with 95% CIs were calculated. For dietary intake
analyses, multiple linear regression models estimated within-
individual differences in energy, nutrient, and food-group intakes
between drinking and nondrinking days by regressing each day
dietary variable on dummy variables for the recall day of the
week, a dummy variable for recall order (day 1 recall compared
with day 2 recall), and a separate fixed effect for each person in
the sample, which controlled for person-level characteristics such
as demographic, lifestyle, and genetic characteristics. The season
of MEC exam was not informative and, therefore, not included in
models. Interactions between variables were estimated and tested
by including product terms between variables in regression models.
Interactions with BMI (in kg/m2) and marital status were con-
sidered; few interactions were shown, and no interactions were
particularly strong. The survey-adjusted Wald's F test was used to
test hypotheses. All analyses were performed with Stata version
12 statistical software that took into account survey stratification
and clustering in the computation of SEs. For significance testing,
a was ,0.05 (2 tailed).
RESULTS
Of 1864 participants (1126 men and 738 women) who con-
sumed alcoholic beverages on one recall day but not the other, the
majority were non-Hispanic white, had at least some college
education, were married or cohabiting, and had moderate or
higher income (Table 1). The majority of participants had never
smoked or had quit. Most participants were light or moderate
drinkers. Approximately 70% of men and 51% of women had
BMI $25.
Alcohol consumption was more likely to be reported on the
first (in-person) than second (telephone) interview (Table 2).

Drinking occurred more often on weekends (Friday, Saturday,
and Sunday) than on weekdays. We did not study intakes by the
type of alcoholic beverage because of relatively small numbers
but note that, in men, beer alone was consumed by 699 partic-
ipants (62%), wine alone was consumed by 153 participants
(14%), distilled spirits alone were consumed by 119 participants
(11%), and mixed drinks alone were consumed by 44 partici-
pants (4%); 111 participants (10%) consumed more than one
type of alcoholic beverage. The respective figures for women
were as follows: beer, 236 participants (32%); wine, 253 par-
ticipants (34%); distilled spirits, 99 participants (13%); mixed
drinks, 93 participants (13%); and more than one type, 57 par-
ticipants (8%).
Energy
Men had significantly higher total energy intakes (433-kcal
excess; P , 0.001) on drinking than on nondrinking days (Table
3). The alcohol in alcoholic beverages contributed 264 of 433
kcal (61%) of the excess. The remaining 168 of 433 kcal (39%
of the excess) (P , 0.01) was contributed by nonalcohol
components of alcoholic beverages (macronutrients naturally
present in straight drinks and in mixers) and by other foods and
beverages.
Women also had significantly higher total energy intakes (299-
kcal excess; P , 0.001) on drinking days. Energy from the al-
cohol in alcoholic beverages contributed 206 kcal (69%) of the
excess. Women did not have significantly higher intakes of total
nonalcohol energy.
Nutrients
Men had significantly higher intakes of total protein (P ,
0.001), total fat (P , 0.01), saturated fat (P , 0.01), mono-
unsaturated fat (P , 0.01), potassium (P , 0.001), and sodium
(P , 0.05) on drinking days (Table 3). Women had signifi-
cantly higher intakes of total fat (P , 0.05), monounsaturated
fat (P , 0.05), polyunsaturated fat (P , 0.05), and potassium
(P , 0.01) on drinking days.
Food groups
Men consumed significantly more white potatoes (P , 0.05);
more foods from the meat, poultry, and fish group (P , 0.001)
[specifically meat (beef, pork, veal, lamb, and game); P ,
0.001]; more combined discretionary oil and solid fat (P ,
0.05); and significantly less fruit (P , 0.05) and milk (P , 0.05)
on days that they drank (Table 4). Women consumed signifi-
cantly more combined discretionary oil and solid fat (P , 0.05)
and significantly less total milk products (P , 0.05) and milk
(P , 0.01) on days that they drank.
Supplemental analyses
To understand whether observed differences in energy intakes
on drinking compared with nondrinking days in current drinkers
were related to within-individual day-to-day variability in dietary
intakes, we examined the day-to-day variability in persons who
drank on both dietary recall days or on neither day (see Tables 1­
5 under "Supplemental data" in the online issue). The covariate
was the recall day of the week. Differences in total energy intake
between the 2 recalls, although not statistically tested, appeared
to be less extreme in men and women who drank on neither day
(men: 3.7%; women: 1.7%) or on both days (men: 6.8%;
women: 9.2%) than in our analytic sample who drank on one
day but not the other (men: 18.2%; women: 17.4%).
Our analyses of the analytic sample controlled for the effects of
both dietary recall order (ie, whether drinking occurred on the
first or second recall) and recall day of the week. We present
stratified analyses by recall order in subsamples, which suggested
that, for men (but not women), having had the first recall on
a drinking day was associated with increased intakes of total
nonalcohol energy, whereas having had the first recall on
a nondrinking day was not (see Tables 6 and 7 under "Supple-
mental data" in the online issue). We also present stratified

analyses by weekend (Friday­Sunday) and weekday in subsamples,
which suggested that, in both men and women, weekend drinking
was associated with increased intakes of total nonalcohol energy,
whereas weekday drinking was not (see Tables 8 and 9 under
"Supplemental data" in the online issue).
DISCUSSION
In our national sample of current drinkers, men consumed
excess nonalcohol energy on drinking days relative to non-
drinking days, but women did not. Both sexes had less-healthy
diets on drinking days; however, men's diets appeared to be
poorer than women's diets.
Our finding that men consumed excess nonalcohol energy on
drinking days is consistent with results from several experimental
studies (4, 17­22). Our finding that women did not consume
excess nonalcohol energy on drinking days could have been due
to a number of factors including their lower total energy intake,
lower consumption of alcohol, or greater dietary vigilance. Also,
the experimental studies were mostly conducted in men, al-
though one study that included women (21) reported a positive
effect in both sexes.
We showed that nutrient intakes differed on drinking and
nondrinking days. The most striking findings were w9­10%
higher drinking day intakes of total protein, total fat, saturated
fat, and protein in men and w7­8% higher drinking day intakes
of total fat, monounsaturated fat, and potassium and an 11%
higher intake of polyunsaturated fat in women. Higher intakes of
total fat and saturated fat are of particular concern in terms of
dietary recommendations.
Our examination of food-group intakes showed changes in
foods reported on drinking days. Men consumed more from the
meat, poultry, and fish group, particularly more meat. Men also
consumed more discretionary oil and solid fat and white potatoes
and less fruit. Although men consumed less milk, their total milk-
group (milk, yogurt, and cheese) intake was unchanged, which
suggested the substitution of milk for other dairy products on
drinking days. Food selections of women on drinking days were
also remarkable for more discretionary oil and solid fat and fewer
products from the milk, yogurt, and cheese group, particularly
milk. We note that women's reduced consumption of milk
should have been reflected in lower intakes of calcium, but this
was not the case. This finding may be explained by the low
amounts of milk (,1 cup) women consumed on both drinking
and nondrinking days. Although food-group data are derived
and, therefore, less precise than nutrient data, they have public
health benefits regarding potential messages to moderate drinkers
about eating behaviors on drinking days. Our sample consisted
almost entirely of moderate drinkers.
Our study used a matched design, and the results were not
directly comparable to those of other epidemiologic studies. We
examined diets of individual drinkers on a single day on which
they drank compared with a single day on which they did not. It
was a within-individual study that used repeated measures with
detailed 24-h data for each day. In contrast, previous epidemi-
ologic studies (4­14) and a clinical trial (15) generally obtained
estimates whereby alcohol and/or diet were averaged over
a period of time, which reflected usual intakes. The majority of
studies showed no association between alcohol consumption
and higher absolute intakes of total nonalcohol energy with the
exception of a U-shaped association in women in one study (5)
and a linear trend across drinking levels in men in another study
(10). The general lack of association was likely because of
compensation over the long term (4).
Strengths of our study were that we examined within-individual
dietary differences on a drinking compared with nondrinking day.
Our repeated-measures design virtually eliminated individual-level
confounding, which is a problematic issue in most epidemiologic
studies. It was necessary to control only for the effects of the dietary
recall administration (order and day of the week). Our study used
a large national sample that was primarily comprised of light to
moderate drinkers, who constitute the majority of drinkers, which
increased its generalizability.
Limitations included that drinking was more likely to be
reported on the first dietary recall and on weekends. The first
recall was more likely to occur on a weekend, possibly because
individuals considered MEC visits most convenient at that time.
However, all analyses were controlled for the order of dietary
recall. All analyses were also controlled for the day of the week.
Nevertheless, we could not dismiss the possibility of residual
confounding. We note that our purpose was to describe cross-
sectional associations between alcohol and dietary intakes on the
day in which alcohol was consumed. We make no claims about
cause and effect. Future studies might consider approaches to
untangle the complex effects of alcohol on drinking day dietary
intake from correlations on the basis of weekend and weekday
drinking (32), social activity (33), or other relevant factors. We
compressed the USDA MyPyramid food groups from 32 to 21 to
increase the statistical power. This alteration may have limited
our ability to determine certain differences (eg, between types of
fats). Our study did not address dietary intake according to
drinking levels because of its matched design.
In conclusion, we showed that diets of current drinkers were
poorer on a day they consumed alcohol than on a day they did not.
Targeting drinking days to improve dietary intake may prove
a useful public health strategy.
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--RAB, CMC, and BIG:
analyzed data; RAB: wrote the manuscript and had primary responsibility
for the final content of the manuscript; and all authors: designed the research,
provided critical input in the writing of the manuscript, and read and ap-
proved the final manuscript. An abstract submitted to the 2012 Research
Society on Alcoholism meeting was selectively published in Alcoholism
Clinical and Experimental Research. None of the authors had a conflict of
interest.
