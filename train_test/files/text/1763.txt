Abstract
Background: Albuminuria, a common marker of kidney damage, serves as an important predictive factor for the
progression of kidney disease and for the development of cardiovascular disease. While the underlying etiology is
unclear, chronic, low-grade inflammation is a suspected key factor. Genetic variants within genes involved in
inflammatory processes may, therefore, contribute to the development of albuminuria.
Methods: We evaluated 60 polymorphisms within 27 inflammatory response genes in participants from the
second phase (1991-1994) of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), a
population-based and nationally representative survey of the United States. Albuminuria was evaluated as
logarithm-transformed albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), as ACR  30 mg/g, and as ACR above sex-specific
thresholds. Multivariable linear regression and haplotype trend analyses were conducted to test for genetic
associations in 5321 participants aged 20 years or older. Differences in allele and genotype distributions among
non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans were tested in additive and codominant genetic
models.
Results: Variants in several genes were found to be marginally associated (uncorrected P value < 0.05) with log
(ACR) in at least one race/ethnic group, but none remained significant in crude or fully-adjusted models when
correcting for the false-discovery rate (FDR). In analyses of sex-specific albuminuria, IL1B (rs1143623) among
Mexican Americans remained significantly associated with increased odds, while IL1B (rs1143623), CRP (rs1800947)
and NOS3 (rs2070744) were significantly associated with ACR  30 mg/g in this population (additive models, FDR-P
< 0.05). In contrast, no variants were found to be associated with albuminuria among non-Hispanic blacks after
adjustment for multiple testing. The only variant among non-Hispanic whites significantly associated with any
outcome was TNF rs1800750, which failed the test for Hardy-Weinberg proportions in this population. Haplotypes
within MBL2, CRP, ADRB2, IL4R, NOS3, and VDR were significantly associated (FDR-P < 0.05) with log(ACR) or
albuminuria in at least one race/ethnic group.
Conclusions: Our findings suggest a small role for genetic variation within inflammation-related genes to the
susceptibility to albuminuria. Additional studies are needed to further assess whether genetic variation in these,
and untested, inflammation genes alter the susceptibility to kidney damage.

Background
Persistent kidney damage is a defining criterion for
chronic kidney disease, a condition that exists in at least
12% of adults in the United States using data from
1999-2004 [1,2]. The presence of kidney damage is often
indicated by increased urine albumin, which is present
in approximately 9-14% of the adult U.S. popula-
tion [1,2]. Albuminuria serves not just as an important
marker of kidney damage but also as a prognostic factor
for the progression of kidney disease. In fact, kidney
damage often precedes a decline in normal kidney func-
tion. Of great clinical importance, albuminuria is also a
strong and independent predictor of cardiovascular dis-
ease (CVD), and of all-cause and CVD-related mortality
(reviewed in [3,4]), even at levels conventionally consid-
ered within the normal range [5].
In adults, the prevalence of albuminuria rises with age
and is further increased in the presence of hypertension or
diabetes. In the U.S. population, the estimated prevalence
of microalbuminuria (typically defined as urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio (ACR) between 30 and 299 mg/g) is
approximately 3% in adults without adverse health condi-
tions, but is approximately 17% in hypertensive persons
and approximately 29% in those with diabetes [6].
The underlying cause(s) of albuminuria are numerous;
but, the mechanisms of injury that lead to loss of albu-
min in the kidneys are unclear. However, some data
suggest that albuminuria is a consequence of widespread
vascular endothelial dysfunction or of chronic, low-grade
inflammation [7,8], two pathophysiologic processes that
may also underlie the strong link between albuminuria
and cardiovascular disease. These processes are them-
selves tightly linked, as inflammation has been shown to
be a major determinant, and consequence, of endothelial
dysfunction [9,10]. Since cytokines and other molecules
that mediate inflammation can mediate vascular
damage, they may play an important role in the patho-
genesis of kidney damage. However, most studies that
have found an association between albuminuria and var-
ious serum or plasma markers of inflammation (e.g.,
CRP, IL-6, TNF-a, fibrinogen, white blood cell count)
have been cross-sectional [11-16]; therefore, no determi-
nation of temporality or causality could be made. Pro-
spective studies have found that the development of
increased urinary albumin excretion is preceded by ele-
vated levels of inflammation markers: CRP in a general
white population [17] and both CRP and fibrinogen in
persons with type 2 diabetes [18]. Such studies lend sup-
port to the notion that inflammation may contribute to
the development of kidney damage.
Accordingly, we were interested in testing genetic
associations with albuminuria for genes involved in the
inflammatory response. There have been few such
studies to date, with the majority of analyses having
tested for association specifically with diabetic nephro-
pathy, end-stage renal disease, or with morbidity or
mortality in these patient populations [19-22], but not
with albuminuria or other measures of kidney damage.
Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the
genetic contribution to the development of albuminuria
by testing polymorphisms in 27 genes involved in the
inflammatory response in DNA samples collected from
participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III). This work is the
first to examine the association of genetic polymorph-
isms with albuminuria using a population-based, nation-
ally representative sample of the U.S. population.
Methods
Study population
NHANES III is a population-based and nationally repre-
sentative survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation of the United States aged 2 months or older that
was conducted from 1988-1994 by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) [23,24]. The survey relied on a
multistage, complex survey design that included four self-
identified race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American, and "other." Oversam-
pling in certain populations­ the very young, the elderly,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans­was per-
formed in order to produce more unbiased estimates of
disease prevalence and other health indicators in these
groups [25]. During the second phase of NHANES III
(1991-1994), white blood cells were frozen and cell lines
immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus, creating a DNA
bank [25]. This DNA bank contains specimens from 7159
participants aged 12 years or older [26], whose characteris-
tics have been described [27].
Analyses were limited to DNA samples of participants
aged 20 years or older (N = 5948) since normal values for
albumin excretion in children are not well established and
the assessment of proteinuria in children differs from
adults [28,29]. The following persons were then excluded:
pregnant women (N = 111), persons in the "other" race/eth-
nic group (N = 276), and individuals with a self-reported
history of kidney cancer (N = 7). We also excluded men-
struating women (N = 233), as others have done [1,6,30],
after finding elevated urine albumin excretion in this group
(data not shown). The final sample size included 5321 adult
participants: 2249 non-Hispanic whites, 1502 non-Hispanic
blacks, and 1570 Mexican Americans.
Selection of genes and polymorphisms
Specific genes were included in our analysis based on
their involvement in inflammation as determined by

information gathered from GeneCards [31], Gene Ontol-
ogy [32,33], and the published literature in the case of
VDR [34]. All available variants within these genes were
included in the current study without regard to allele
frequency or the amount of linkage disequilibrium
between variants. The majority of the polymorphisms
were chosen from a larger set that had been genotyped
for an NHANES III study on allele frequencies and gen-
otype prevalence in the U.S. population [27]. In addi-
tion, the two available variants from relevant genome-
wide association studies were also included: GCKR var-
iant rs1260326 in relation to plasma C-reactive protein
levels [35]; and rs890945 in an unknown gene in rela-
tion to kidney function [36].
Genotyping and quality control methods
Polymorphisms in APOE (N = 2), CRP (N = 15), GCKR
(N = 1), and an unknown gene (N = 1) were genotyped
in NHANES III by various investigators [26]. Our group
genotyped all remaining variants included in this study;
and details have been published [27]. Briefly, rs890945
and eight CRP variants (rs35500644, rs11265260,
rs12093699, rs12744244, rs2027471, rs2592887,
rs2794520, and rs3093075) were genotyped by a custom
Illumina GoldenGate assay (San Diego, CA). GCKR var-
iant rs1260326 was genotyped on a matrix-assisted
laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectro-
scopy platform (Sequenom, San Diego, CA) [37]. All
remaining polymorphisms were genotyped using Taq-
Man (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or MGB
Eclipse (Nanogen, Bothell, WA) assays [27,38,39]. Geno-
typing was performed by laboratory staff that were
blinded to the phenotypic data of the study participants.
All genetic variants passed quality control criteria as
defined by NCHS [26,27].
Measurements and definitions
Urinary albumin (g/mL) and urinary creatinine (mg/
dL) were measured from one random, untimed spot
urine collection as previously described [6]. Urinary
albumin concentration was measured by solid-phase
fluorescent immunoassay; and urinary creatinine con-
centration was measured by the modified kinetic Jaffe
method. Further details of all NHANES III laboratory
methods are available online [40]. Albuminuria was
defined using the continuous variable urinary albumin-
to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and as dichotomous variables
using either a single threshold (urinary ACR  30 mg/g)
or sex-specific cut-offs (urinary ACR  17 mg/g in men
and  25 mg/g in women) to account for greater creati-
nine excretion in men than in women.
Several variables were used to characterize study parti-
cipants and were included in multivariable-adjusted ana-
lyses. Age was categorized as 20-50 yrs or  50 yrs.
Waist-to-hip ratio was defined by sex-specific cut-offs:
0.90 for males and 0.85 for females. Diabetes was
defined as self-reported diabetes (answering "yes" to
"ever been told you have sugar/diabetes"), but excluding
women with a history of only gestational diabetes.
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (bp)
 140 mmHg, diastolic bp  90 mmHg, or if the partici-
pant was currently taking prescribed medicine for
hypertension. Estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease Study equation re-expressed for use with
a standardized serum creatinine (Scr
) assay [41-43]:
eGFR = 175 × (standardized Scr
-1.154) × (age-0.203) ×
(0.742 if female) × (1.212 if black). NHANES III serum
creatinine values were standardized as described [44].
Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS-Callable
SUDAAN 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC, USA) and SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, USA) to account for the NHANES III complex
sampling design. Nationally representative estimates
were calculated using sample weights for the NHANES
III DNA bank as previously described [27]. Appropriate
standard errors and confidence intervals were calculated
using the Taylor series linearization approach [45,46] to
correct for correlations within sampled clusters, includ-
ing the possible genetic relatedness of persons sampled
from the same household.
In descriptive analyses, the prevalence of albuminuria
and the geometric mean of ACR were calculated by
relevant demographic and clinical characteristics of the
participants. Allele frequencies and tests for deviations
from Hardy-Weinberg proportions were calculated as
previously described [27]. The associations between the
genetic variants and each outcome were assessed sepa-
rately in each race/ethnic group in crude and adjusted
logistic regression models. Associations were also exam-
ined in combined analyses of all participants after con-
trolling for race/ethnicity in the logistic regression
models. Urinary ACR was positively skewed and, thus,
logarithm-transformed to approximate a normal distri-
bution. The logarithm-transformed values were used in
all analyses of urinary ACR as a continuous variable.
Covariates were determined by significant association
(P < 0.05) of the variable (i.e., age, sex, education, smok-
ing, alcohol use, and waist-to-hip ratio) with the outcome
in non-genetic models in at least one of the race/ethnic
groups. Hypertension and diabetes were not considered,
as these conditions are often part of the causal pathways
that result in chronic kidney disease. Variables included
in all multivariable models are listed in each table.
Genetic variants were tested assuming two modes of
inheritance: additive (with a change in the odds ratio or

beta-coefficient per copy of the minor allele) or codomi-
nant (all three genotypes assessed individually). The
minor allele of each variant was defined by the preva-
lence in the total population using NHANES III genetic
data [27,39]. Haplotype trend regression [47] was used
to test for associations involving multiple variants within
a single gene. The HAPLOTYPE procedure available in
SAS/Genetics 9.2 was used to calculate the probability
that an individual has a specific haplotype given their
unphased genotype and the estimated haplotype fre-
quencies. Haplotype terms that reflected the number
and probabilities of the haplotypes were defined based
on the method proposed by Zaykin, et al. [47]. Since
our study included a large number of polymorphisms in
CRP, the incremental search algorithm available in the
HTSNP procedure in SAS/Genetics 9.2 was used to
identify a set of markers for this gene that tagged non-
rare (frequency >5%) haplotypes with a proportion of
diversity explained (PDE) greater than 0.99. The haplo-
type analysis for CRP included only those markers iden-
tified with this procedure: rs2027471, rs3091244, and
rs12744244. Rare haplotypes (frequency < 5%) within
each gene were coded in aggregate as "other", except in
cases where only one haplotype was rare. The major iso-
forms of APOE -2, 3, and 4-were determined from
the rs429358 and rs7412 variants as previously described
[39] and were tested assuming additive and codominant
modes of inheritance. For all genes, the effect of each
individual haplotype, as well as the overall association
between all haplotypes and each outcome, were tested
using regression models. Regression models with CRP
variant rs35500644 often produced errors in SUDAAN
due to its very low minor allele frequency. This variant
was, consequently, excluded from presentation and
inclusion in any haplotypes.
Prevalence odds ratios and beta-coefficients with 95%
confidence intervals were estimated from both univari-
ate and multivariable regression models. All associations
(descriptive and genetic) were tested at the threshold of
0.05 using the Satterthwaite-adjusted F-statistic, a stable
and preferred test statistic for the analysis of complex
survey data [48]. For all genetic association analyses,
P-values from the Satterthwaite-adjusted F-statistics
were adjusted to control for the false discovery rate
(FDR) [49,50] in each race/ethnic group.
Results
Basic demographic characteristics and urinary albumin
excretion profile of the included NHANES III partici-
pants (N = 5321) are listed in Table 1. The geometric
mean of ACR differed among most measured demo-
graphic and clinical groups, including those defined by
sex, age, and waist:hip ratio (P value  0.0007 for all).
However, this measurement did not differ by race/ethnic
group or by smoking status. The estimated total popula-
tion prevalence of albuminuria in adults  20 years was
10.98 ± 0.80%, with approximately 9.8% of men and
12.2% of women having the condition as defined by sex-
specific cutoff values. The prevalence of albuminuria
was considerably higher in older participants, in persons
with diabetes, and in persons with hypertension (all
P <0.0001). The prevalence of albuminuria also differed
by race/ethnic group, educational attainment, alcohol
use, and waist:hip ratio. In participants with elevated
levels of serum CRP, which is a common indicator of
inflammation, the geometric mean of ACR and the pre-
valence of albuminuria were increased (P < 0.0001). Par-
ticipants with moderately to severely reduced kidney
function, defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2, also displayed a higher
prevalence of albuminuria and elevated geometric mean
of ACR (P < 0.0001).
Allele frequencies of each of the included candidate
gene polymorphisms are presented in Table 2. For 59 of
the 60 variants (98.3%), the allele frequency varied sig-
nificantly across race/ethnic groups (P < 0.05). There
are several variants with substantial relative or absolute
differences in allele frequency between populations (e.g.,
CRP variants rs3093058 and rs3093066).
Each polymorphism was tested individually for asso-
ciation with log(ACR) (as a continuous variable) and
with albuminuria (as dichotomous variables) in univari-
ate and multivariable regression models stratified by
race/ethnic group. Two multivariable models were
assessed: adjustment for age and (where appropriate)
sex, and full adjustment for a number of demographic
and clinical variables. Variants with results of P < 0.05
in additive genetic models prior to adjustment for the
false-discovery rate (FDR) are presented in Tables 3, 4
and 5 (crude and fully-adjusted models only). Complete
results for all individual polymorphisms under additive
and codominant modes of inheritance are available in
Additional File 1, Tables S1-S6.
In additive models, no more than five variants were
associated with log(ACR) in any race/ethnic group in
crude or fully-adjusted analyses (uncorrected P values <
0.05; Table 3). The results of models adjusting only for
age and sex were similar to the fully-adjusted models
for each variant in each race/ethnicity (Additional File 1,
Table S1). Only one association with log(ACR) was sta-
tistically significant in any of the race/ethnic groups
after adjustment for multiple testing: TNF variant
rs1800750 in non-Hispanic whites in age-sex adjusted
models (Additional File 1, Table S1). Of note, rs1800750
failed the test for Hardy-Weinberg proportions in this
population (P < 0.0001, Table 2). Association results for

log(ACR) were similar when tested in codominant mod-
els, and no FDR-adjusted P value reached statistical sig-
nificance (Additional File 1, Table S2).
When albuminuria was defined as a dichotomous vari-
able using sex-specific cutoffs, variants in TNF and VDR
were associated with increased odds of albuminuria in
non-Hispanic whites under an additive genetic model
(Table 4 and Additional File 1, Table S3). After adjust-
ment for multiple testing, only TNF variant rs1800750
was statistically significant in crude (FDR-P = 0.0180)
and age-adjusted (FDR-P = 0.0059) models. Among
non-Hispanic blacks, variants in CRP, MBL2, TGFB1/
B9D2, TNF, VDR and an unknown gene (rs890945) had
uncorrected P values <0.05 in crude or multivariable
models. However, none of these findings were statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for multiple testing. In
Mexican Americans, variants in CRP, IL1B, IL10, NOS3,
PON1, and TNF were marginally associated (uncor-
rected P value < 0.05) with the odds of sex-specific albu-
minuria in one or more regression models. Of these,
only IL1B variant rs1143623 remained significantly
associated after correction for multiple testing (age-
adjusted: OR = 1.36, FDR-P = 0.0058; fully-adjusted
OR = 1.46, FDR-P < 0.0001) (Table 4 and Additional
File 1, Table S3). Several of the variants found margin-
ally associated with albuminuria under an additive
model were also marginally associated in codominant
models, although none reach statistical significance after
FDR adjustment (Additional File 1, Table S4).
Compared to the results with sex-specific albuminuria,
findings were not remarkably different when using the
single-threshold definition of albuminuria (Table 5 and
Additional File 1, Table S5). In the non-Hispanic white
population, only TNF rs1800750 remained significantly
associated with albuminuria in crude and age-sex
adjusted additive genetic models. In non-Hispanic
blacks, fewer polymorphisms were marginally associated
with single threshold albuminuria than with sex-specific
albuminuria; and none remained significant after FDR
adjustment. In contrast, among Mexican Americans
many of the same variants as with sex-specific albumi-
nuria had uncorrected P-values < 0.05 for urinary

ACR  30 mg/g. Three variants remained significantly
associated in fully-adjusted additive models after cor-
recting for multiple testing: rs1800947 in CRP (FDR-P
value < 0.0001), rs1143623 in IL1B (FDR- P value =
0.0029), and rs2070744 in NOS3 (FDR-P = 0.0155). In
age-sex adjusted models, the IL1B and NOS3 variants
were also significantly associated with this outcome
(Additional File 1, Table S5). In codominant models, the
only variant significantly associated with the odds of sin-
gle-threshold albuminuria was CRP rs1800947 among
Mexican Americans (fully-adjusted model only, FDR-P <
0.0001; Table 5 and Additional File 1, Table S6).
To increase the sample size for these analyses, we also
tested all participants as one group and adjusted for
race/ethnicity in all regression models. Findings for each
outcome in both additive and codominant genetic mod-
els were largely consistent with the race-stratified ana-
lyses for non-Hispanic whites (data not shown). The
only variant to remain significant after FDR adjustment
was TNF rs1800750, which was associated with
increased prevalence of albuminuria (single-threshold
and sex-specific) in at least one multivariable additive
genetic model. No variants remained significant in
codominant models for any outcome after correction for
multiple testing (data not shown).
Haplotype analyses were conducted for the thirteen
genes containing at least two genotyped polymorphisms.
The C-G-C-G-G haplotype of MBL2 in non-Hispanic
whites (crude model) and the A-C-C haplotype of CRP
in non-Hispanic blacks (fully-adjusted model) were asso-
ciated with decreased ACR after FDR adjustment (Addi-
tional File 1, Table S7). Among Mexican Americans,
haplotypes within ADRB2 (A-G), IL4R (C-A), and VDR
(T-T) were associated with log(ACR) in crude genetic
models (FDR-P values < 0.05). For these haplotypes,
age-sex adjusted models were only marginally associated
with log(ACR) (data not shown). The C-T haplotype of
NOS3 was statistically associated with decreased odds of
categorically-defined albuminuria, in fully-adjusted mod-
els among Mexican Americans (FDR-P = 0.0220 for sex-
specific albuminuria and < 0.0001 for ACR  30 mg/g).
Across all populations, the only significant association in
age-sex (where appropriate) adjusted models is the
NOS3 C-T haplotype in relation to single-threshold
albuminuria in Mexican Americans (OR = 0.38; uncor-
rected P = 0.0006; FDR-P = 0.0144) (data not shown).

No other individual haplotypes or global tests for haplo-
type effect indicated a significant association with log
(ACR) or albuminuria after adjustment for multiple test-
ing (Additional File 1, Table S7). APOE isoforms were
assessed individually (additive model) and in combina-
tion (codominant model). Of note, the T-T isoform
(also known as 2) was marginally associated with
increased odds of sex-specific albuminuria among non-
Hispanic blacks after full adjustment for covariates (OR:
1.51, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.21; uncorrected P = 0.0366), but
not in crude or age-adjusted genetic models (data not
shown). No other isoforms of APOE were associated
with any outcome in any race/ethnic group, nor were
any global tests of APOE isoforms significant in additive
or codominant models.
Discussion
Inflammation is a suspected cause of kidney damage;
and we were interested in testing associations of genes
involved in the inflammatory response with urinary
albumin excretion. We describe here the results of this
work carried out with adults who participated in
NHANES III, a population-based sample survey that is
nationally representative of the U.S. population. We
restricted analyses to albuminuria outcomes instead of
chronic kidney disease, since the genes that influence
renal function may differ from those contributing to
renal damage and proteinuria [51-53]. Many of the
included genes are involved in other cellular or physio-
logic pathways, such as lipid metabolism (e.g., APOE,
PPARG), hemostasis (e.g., F2, F5, FGB), and oxidative
stress/nitric oxide production (e.g., PON1, CAT, NOS2A,
NOS3).
It is unknown whether polymorphisms in inflamma-
tion genes affect the normal variation in urinary albu-
min excretion in humans, or whether such genetic
variation plays a role only in the susceptibility to renal
damage once some sort of ischemic or toxic insult is
acquired. Our results only minimally support a role for
such polymorphisms in the establishment of normal
urinary albumin excretion, since all but one individual
genotype and few haplotypes were significantly asso-
ciated with continuous log(ACR) after adjustment for
multiple testing. We do show that increasing minor
allele copy number of polymorphisms in TNF in non-
Hispanic whites (crude and age-adjusted models) and
IL1B in Mexican Americans (both multivariable models)
were associated with albuminuria as defined by sex-spe-
cific criteria. However, TNF rs1800750 failed the test for
Hardy-Weinberg proportions in non-Hispanic whites, so
this result should be interpreted cautiously. No poly-
morphisms were associated with sex-specific albumi-
nuria in codominant models in any race/ethnic group.
For comparison, we also analyzed data for albuminuria
defined by a single threshold for both men and women.
These analyses yielded results similar to those for sex-
specific albuminuria, though among Mexican Ameri-
cans, genetic variants in CRP and NOS3 were also sig-
nificantly associated with ACR  30 mg/g under additive
models. This CRP variant (rs1800947) was also the only
polymorphism significantly associated with single-
threshold albuminuria in codominant models after cor-
recting for multiple testing (FDR-P < 0.0001). The sig-
nificance of this variant only after full multivariable
adjustment may be due to instability of the regression
model because of the low allele frequency of rs1800947
in Mexican Americans. CRP haplotypes were not asso-
ciated with single threshold albuminuria in Mexican
Americans, though rare CRP haplotypes as a group were
marginally associated (uncorrected P value < 0.05) with
sex-specific ACR. The C-T haplotype of NOS3 was
found to be significantly associated with both definitions
of albuminuria in Mexican Americans, strongly implicat-
ing this gene in the susceptibility to kidney damage. We
found no evidence of an effect of other haplotypes on
the odds of albuminuria after adjusting for multiple
testing.
We calculated the power of our study to detect asso-
ciations of individual polymorphisms with log(ACR) and
sex-specific albuminuria within each race/ethnic group,
using a two-sided a set at 0.05 and assuming a design
effect of 1.2. For log(ACR), we calculated power to
detect effect sizes consistent with an R2 of 0.5%. In non-
Hispanic whites, we have 86% power to detect changes
in the log(ACR) beta coefficient of 0.41 and 0.25 at
minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of 10% and 40%,
respectively. In non-Hispanic blacks, our power is 70%
to detect changes in the beta of 0.33 and 0.20 at the
same MAFs. For Mexican-Americans, changes in the
beta coefficient of 0.45 (at 10% MAF) and 0.28 (at 40%
MAF) could be detected with 72% power. For sex-
specific albuminuria, we calculated the study power for
an odds ratio of 1.3, which is indicative of effects found
both in candidate gene studies [54] and in genome-wide
association studies [55]. At MAFs of 10% and 40%, the
power to detect an OR = 1.3 in non-Hispanic whites is
32% and 64%, respectively. In non-Hispanic blacks,
power is 18% and 36%, respectively, at these MAFs. For
the Mexican American population, study power to
detect an OR = 1.3 is 24% and 49% at MAFs of 10%
and 40%, respectively.
Few published studies have assessed the association of
inflammation-related genes with albuminuria. No asso-
ciation with albuminuria was found for the TGFB1
Pro10Leu (rs1800470) variant in non-diabetic Chinese
[56]. Neither -509C > T (rs1800469) nor rs1800470 was
found associated with urine albumin levels or albumi-
nuria in hypertensive Italian men [57], though the TC

and CC genotypes of the Pro10Leu variant was found
associated with albuminuria and urine albumin excre-
tion in a separate study of Italian hypertensive patients
[58]. NOS3 -786T > C (rs2070744), but not Asp298Glu
(rs1799983), was positively associated with increased
ACR and higher risk of albuminuria in diabetic and
nondiabetic European American family members [59].
Neither variant was associated with urine albumin
excretion or albuminuria in a smaller study of hyperten-
sive white men [60]; nor was the Asp298Glu variant
associated with urinary albumin excretion in healthy
Venezuelans [61]. Neither NOS3 variant was associated
with ACR in a family-based study of Mexican Ameri-
cans [62], a finding not completely supported by our
study. The AA genotype of PON1 variant rs662
(Gln192Arg) was recently found associated with albumi-
nuria in a large study of Japanese, but only among
women [63]. Genetic variation in the CCL5 gene has
been associated with ACR in a non-diabetic Japanese
population, but the -95C > G variant (rs2280788)
included in our analyses was not studied [64]. The
Pro12Ala variant (rs1801282) of PPARG has been asso-
ciated with urinary albumin excretion in a type 2 dia-
betic population [65]. The well studied APOE variants
rs429358 and rs7412, from which the APOE 2, 3, and
4 alleles (isoforms) are composed, were weakly asso-
ciated with glomerular filtration rate (a measure of kid-
ney function) in non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic
blacks in NHANES III, but kidney damage was not
assessed separately [39]. In one study that assessed pro-
gression of chronic kidney disease, APOE genotypes
were not significantly associated with macroalbuminuria
(ACR  300 g/mg) [66]. Studies of MBL2 variants have
been limited primarily to type 1 diabetic populations, in
which there are conflicting data on the role of MBL2
polymorphisms in diabetic nephropathy [67,68]. To our
knowledge, there have been no published genetic asso-
ciation studies of urinary albumin excretion or albumi-
nuria that included variants in many of the genes in
which we found polymorphisms or haplotypes signifi-
cantly associated with any outcome in at least one race/
ethnic group (e.g., CRP, IL1B, TNF, or VDR).
Studies such as ours are complicated by the fact that
the assessment of albuminuria in any population is not
straightforward. Though the gold standard for the quan-
titative evaluation of proteinuria is a 24-hr urine collec-
tion, this method is inconvenient and is prone to errors
[28]. For the screening of adults for proteinuria, various
organizations recommend measurement of an untimed
(i.e., spot) urine sample using a ratio of albumin to crea-
tinine [69]. This use of a ratio corrects for variability
due to hydration, diuretics, osmotic diuresis, and con-
centrating defects [28,70] and has been shown to
correlate well with 24-hr urine albumin excretion
measurements [28,71,72]. Most often, albuminuria is
defined as urinary ACR  30 mg/g for both men and
women. Sex-specific criteria have been advocated in
order to account for greater creatinine excretion in men
than in women [30,73-75], though there are no explicit
recommendations for use of such criteria [28]. Impor-
tantly, given the strong predictive value of even low-
grade albuminuria for cardiovascular disease, it has been
suggested that albuminuria be interpreted as a conti-
nuum rather than as threshold cut-off values, as dichot-
omizing albuminuria results in the loss of important
clinical information [5,76]. Therefore, we analyzed urin-
ary ACR as both a continuous variable and as dichoto-
mous variables. We did not adjust for hypertension or
diabetes in our analyses as these conditions are major
risk factors for chronic kidney disease. The genetic asso-
ciations examined here may have been distorted if the
included polymorphisms act, at least partially, via these
causal pathways to affect urine albumin excretion.
Statistical analyses were performed for individual
polymorphisms under two modes of inheritance. Addi-
tive models detect both additive and dominant genetic
loci effectively, but perform poorly for recessive alleles
[77,78]. Codominant models have the best performance
when the true inheritance pattern is unknown [77,78].
However, codominant models seemed to be less robust
in situations of low MAF, such that our estimates may
be less stable and our power to identify a recessive
effect poor. Furthermore, odds ratios could not be esti-
mated for some codominant models when the MAF
was very low.
Our study has several limitations, some of which are
specific to analyses in NHANES. First, we included one
spot urine sample for the measurement of urinary ACR,
as repeat tests were performed only in a small subset of
NHANES III participants [1,79]. Therefore, we could
not differentiate between participants with persistent
albuminuria and those with transiently elevated urinary
ACR. The use of the single albuminuria measurement
could misclassify cases and controls and bias our results
since agreement between initial and repeat urine tests
was not perfect [1,28,79]. Secondly, because NHANES
III is a nationally representative study, there were few
participants with severe kidney damage. In fact, only a
very small proportion (N = 128; 1.03 ± 0.18%) of per-
sons in our study population displayed clinical protei-
nuria (ACR  250 mg/g in men or  355 mg/g in
women). This may have hampered our ability to detect
genetic associations with log(ACR) or albuminuria. Also,
we did not perform separate analyses for diabetics or
hypertensives as the resulting sample size within each
race/ethnic group would have been limiting. However,
there is some evidence that similar genes may contri-
bute to ACR in both nondiabetic and diabetic

individuals [80]. Furthermore, we were unable to assess
population stratification in our analyses, as data from
ancestry-informative markers are not yet available for
NHANES III. The large sample size of NHANES III did
allow for separate analyses within each of the three
main race/ethnic groups, self-reported designations that
have been shown to correspond with ancestry as derived
from ancestry-informative markers for these populations
[81-85]. These race/ethnic group-stratified analyses
enabled us to account at least partially for differences in
albuminuria profile, allele frequencies, and linkage dise-
quilibrium patterns between race/ethnicities. We cannot,
however, discount that there may be residual population
substructure within the race/ethnic groups that may
have affected our results. Therefore, caution should be
exercised in interpreting our findings, especially in non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans, since these
populations have experienced recent genetic admixture.
In addition, the lack of "replication" of marginally asso-
ciated (uncorrected P-value < 0.05) or significantly asso-
ciated variants across race/ethnic groups may be due to
differences in the underlying linkage disequilibrium pat-
terns of the populations, due to untested interactions, or
due to lack of power. Indeed, for categorical outcomes,
our power to detect a typical effect size (OR = 1.3) in
each race/ethnic group was modest. The combined ana-
lyses that included all participants and adjusted for race/
ethnicity did not affect our overall findings, as the statis-
tical weighting of the race/ethnic groups produced
results not materially different than those found in non-
Hispanic whites alone.
A couple of limitations are not specific to NHANES.
Defining albuminuria with sex-specific criteria does not
alleviate all concerns regarding the measurement of
urine albumin excretion. It has been proposed that addi-
tional urinary ACR thresholds that account for differ-
ences by age [86,87] and race/ethnicity [30,74] may be
needed to avoid misclassification of certain demographic
groups, though no specific guidelines have been devel-
oped. In addition, the use of FDR-adjusted P values to
determine statistical significance may be overly conser-
vative, as the assumption of independent tests is not
met given that some polymorphisms are correlated
owing to linkage disequilibrium.
The NHANES data are a unique resource for epide-
miologic analyses in a large, population-based and
nationally representative sample of the U.S. population.
Our findings are generalizeable to the larger U.S. popu-
lation and point to a few genes that may play a role in
the susceptibility to albuminuria. Ideally, we could have
included other variants known to be related to the pro-
gression and severity of renal disease, such as those
within inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and polymorphisms
identified in a recent genome-wide association study as
significantly associated with urine albumin excretion
[36]. Such variants, however, have not yet been geno-
typed in NHANES III. NHANES should be used for
additional research into the associations between genetic
variants and renal disease and to evaluate the impor-
tance of gene-environment interactions.
Conclusions
We report the association of a small set of polymorph-
isms and haplotypes in genes involved in inflammation
with albuminuria-related outcomes. This study is the
first to examine genetic associations with such outcomes
using a population-based and nationally representative
sample of the U.S. population. Additional studies are
needed to further assess genetic variation in these, and
untested, inflammation genes and the susceptibility to
kidney damage. Furthermore, NHANES can be used to
facilitate the population-level assessment of new
and validated polymorphisms for kidney disease
susceptibility.
