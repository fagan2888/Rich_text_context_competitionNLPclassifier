According to the National Health Survey, one in two women
and one in three men in Australia above 60 years are likely
to experience an osteoporotic fracture (Australian Bureau of
Statistics [ABS], 2009). Sustaining an initial vertebral frac-
ture is said to increase the risk of subsequent fracture
(Briggs, Greig, & Wark, 2003; Sontag & Krege, 2010), and
each fracture event sustained is thought to be associated
with excess morbidity and mortality (Pasco et al., 2005).
Osteoporosis is estimated to cost the Australian taxpayer
some AU$7 billion a year (The Royal Australian College
of General Practitioners, 2010). Most people who have
osteoporosis do not know it (Taylor, Gill, Phillips, & Leach,
2003), which represents a lost opportunity for timely help-
seeking and behavioral change to mitigate risk of fracture
and its sequelae. Furthermore, the large numbers of people
classified as being at "modest risk" in fact sustain more than
half of all fractures occurring in the community (Pasco
et al., 2006)--that is, outside of hospital or community care
settings--suggesting that public health measures that moti-
vate behavioral change may be more effective in preventing
fracture than attempting to provide medical therapy to such
a high proportion of the overall population.
However, the statistics indicate that these measures are
not universally effective. For example, a large Australian
population survey reported that men and women across
all age groups not only underestimated the risk of getting
osteoporosis in the future but also had little knowledge of the
disease and its risk factors (Taylor et al., 2003). This study of
3,001 randomly selected adults found that the overall
perceived risk of getting osteoporosis was low (59.7%) or
moderate (40.6%). This knowledge gap occurs elsewhere;
worldwide, osteoporosis remains largely undiagnosed
(Taylor et al., 2003) and underinvestigated (Cheng & Green,
2008; Otmar et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been widely
reported in Australia and internationally that prescription
rates for osteoporosis treatments, as well as adherence to
treatment, are suboptimal (Cadarette, Gignac, Jaglal, Beaton,
& Hawker, 2009; Gold & Silverman, 2006; Kaufmann et al.,
2005; Lekkerkerker et al., 2007; Rossini et al., 2006). For
example, a 2007 systematic review found a wide variation
(17.9%-78.0%) in patient persistence with bisphosphonate
treatment at 12 months (Cramer, Gold, Silverman, &
Lewiecki, 2007).
Understanding how consumers in specific sociocultural
settings view a given health problem is essential in develop-
ing effective, targeted social marketing messages to influ-
ence positive health behaviors and health-seeking (Mostow

Abstract
This article identifies cultural models of osteoporosis, as shared by community-dwelling older women in southeastern
Australia, and compares these with cultural knowledge conveyed through social marketing. Cultural models are mental
constructs about specific domains in everyday life,such as health and illness,which are shared within a community. We applied
domain analyses to data obtained from in-depth interviews and stakeholder-identified print materials.The response domains
identified from our case studies made up the shared cultural model "Osteoporosis has low salience," particularly when
ranked against other threats to health.The cultural knowledge reflected in the print materials supported a cultural model
of low salience. Cultural cues embedded in social marketing messages on osteoporosis may be internalized and motivating
in unintended ways. Identifying and understanding cultural models of osteoporosis within a community may provide valuable
insights to inform the development of targeted health messages.

2 SAGE Open
et al., 2010). In this article, we compare cultural models of
osteoporosis shared among older women in the study region
with those embedded in social marketing messages on
osteoporosis.
Materials and Method
Note that we use the term "consumer" in reference to adult
members of the general community, regardless of whether
they are consumers of health services, after Buckley and Ó
Tuama's call for an expansion of "the notion of the health
service user to include those who may not be directly using
the health service, but who are consuming health messages"
(Buckley & Ó Tuama, 2010, p. 593). It would not have been
appropriate to refer to participants in the community case
study as "patients" or "clients"; all participants in the study
could be considered consumers of health messages, a central
topic in this article.
Social marketing approaches typically rely on theories of
consumer behavior such as the health belief model, theory of
reasoned action/planned behavior, and social cognitive the-
ory; however, there is little consensus on which models are
most appropriate for particular populations and problems
(Lefebvre, 2000), and little is understood about how con-
sumers' experiences of a particular disease or condition can
be utilized to complement these theoretical models and thus
enhance social marketing approaches (Barg & Grier, 2008).
A cultural models approach provides an inductive method by
which to understand consumer responses to health commu-
nications in the domain of interest (Barg & Grier, 2008).
Underpinning the cultural models approach are two related
theories about the nature of knowledge and meaning: (a) that
as human beings, we each uniquely attribute meaning to phe-
nomena, as well as to our own existence within the world
(social constructivism), and (b) that the world holds no
meaning prior to our experience of it (social construction-
ism; Crotty, 1998; Patton, 2002). In this context, we sought
to explore participants' perspectives as individuals and as
actors within their society/community, since the two roles
are separate, yet deeply connected.
Hawkins, Kreuter, Resnicow, Fishbein, and Dijkstra (2008)
described three distinct categories on a continuum of tech-
niques used in health communications: mass communication,
targeting, and tailoring. At the one end, mass communication
broadcasts identical messages to "relatively large, undifferen-
tiated audiences" (Kreuter et al., 2008, p. 455) and may be
considered less than ideal in communicating about a condition
such as osteoporosis, since the message may not be relevant to
large segments of the broadcast audience, and those segments
of the audience for whom it may be relevant could assume that
the messages are intended for others, or at least not for them.
At the other end of the continuum, tailoring customizes mes-
sages "matched to the needs and preferences of individuals"
(Kretuer et al., 2008, p. 455). Given evidence that tailored
health messages are better read and recalled than nontailored
messages (Kreuter, Oswald, Bull, & Clark, 2000), it would
appear to be an ideal technique for communicating with
people who need to be provided with relevant information
about osteoporosis, but is understandably expensive in terms
of cost and effort required to gather and maintain data from
and about the intended audience (Hawkins et al., 2008).
Targeting presents a middle-ground technique for communi-
cating with large audiences about issues relevant to them,
using the technique of "segmentation," whereby a proportion
of the population, such as a demographic category, receives
a shared message (Hawkins et al., 2008). In this article, it is
assumed that identification and understanding of the domi-
nant cultural models shared among the target audience of
women aged 75 years and older will provide insights into the
appropriate segmentation of health messages to them, and
that identifying the cultural knowledge underpinning the
print materials will help to indicate whether their messages
were appropriate for this market segment.
Cultural models are mental constructs about specific
domains in everyday life, such as health and illness, which
are shared within a community, and which may assist efforts
to interpret human behavior (Barg & Grier, 2008). While
individuals, families, and organizations have their own
models for how the world works, based on their respective
experiences and influences, the models that are shared
within a community become the cultural models of that
society (Dressler, 2004). Consensus theory states that a cul-
tural domain exists when there is a moderately high level of
consensus within the community in question (Furlow, 2003).
In the case of osteoporosis, the cultural domain "osteoporo-
sis" is confirmed by consensus within the medical fraternity,
which also provides a consensus definition for the profes-
sion. However, this is not to say that the same cultural model
exists--if indeed it does exist--at the community (i.e., lay
person's) level or among other groups in society. It is pos-
sible that, for example, policy makers, economists, medical
practitioners, and ordinary members of society have differ-
ent cultural models of the same phenomenon. Furthermore,
a high level of consensus does not mean that cultural beliefs
about a phenomenon are homogeneous or that they are
shared among all members of the community. In this article,
we aim to identify the dominant cultural models that may
assist in health communications in a particular setting. In so
doing, we draw on aspects of cultural consensus theory. We
do not apply the theoretical model for quantitative analysis,
but to support the notion that consensus underlies cultural
models.
Cultural models may be uncovered through a variety of
research strategies. For example, cognitive anthropologists
examine data on how people talk and behave to uncover
cultural models that explain how they function within their
respective societies (Quinn & Holland, 1987). In the United
States, Barg and Grier (2008) used qualitative interviews to
identify a cultural model of breast cancer shared by African
American women, which suggested that they did not
Otmar et al. 3
perceive the disease as particularly relevant to them, despite
prevailing messages in the media. Thus, cultural models can
help to explain both the superficial and deeper meanings
attributed to phenomena within a community. A superficial
meaning of osteoporosis could be the fact that it is a condi-
tion affecting the bones; a deeper meaning might be inferred
from the common adage that osteoporosis is a "silent dis-
ease." Identifying and understanding the dominant cultural
models shared within a community can therefore be used
to inform the development of appropriately targeted social
marketing messages and campaigns. The findings from the
Barg and Grier study demonstrated how salient social
marketing messages might be developed to effectively reach
its particular target audience.
In this article, we aim to explore dominant cultural
models of osteoporosis shared by members of the Geelong
community, and to compare that with the cultural knowledge
implicit in relevant social marketing materials on osteoporo-
sis, including popular print media such as women's maga-
zines. Using this construct, we offer a novel approach to
understanding consumer perspectives and responses to
health communications on osteoporosis. To the best of our
knowledge, to date no Australian studies have been con-
ducted to explore cultural models of osteoporosis, and we are
unaware of any studies examining cultural knowledge of
osteoporosis as represented in social marketing.
Setting
The study was undertaken in the regional city of Geelong in
southeastern Australia. Geelong has a moderately large,
stable population (160,991 at the 2006 Census; ABS, 2007)
and is located within the national statistical boundary known
as the Barwon Statistical Division (BSD). At the 2006
Census, the total population of the BSD was 197,477 and its
characteristics included 51.3% females, 78.9% Australian
born, 0.7% Indigenous Australian, 14.2% aged 65 to 84
years, and 2.1% aged 85 years and older. More than 70% of
residents owned or were purchasing their own home, and
93.7% of the labor force was employed at the time of the
2006 Census. In these and other respects, the region's social,
cultural, and geographical demographics closely resemble
national socioeconomic indicators, making it an ideal setting
for epidemiological and other research (Pasco, Henry,
Gawdry, Nicholson, & Kotowicz, 1999).
Participants
Eight participants were assigned to one of two case studies
presented in this analysis, which was nested within a larger
qualitative study (n = 65) of challenges and enablers in the
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis in women and men
aged 55 years and older. Recruitment was achieved by solic-
iting volunteers through community notices, articles in local
media, flyers, and word of mouth.
Cultural models present somewhat of an enigma; it is
acknowledged in the literature that it would be near impos-
sible to uncover all the cultural models about a topic held
within a given community, not only because of the sheer
number and the likely complexity of links and overlaps of
potential cultural models, but also because these models are
dynamic and dynamically held and shared (Holland &
Quinn, 1987). Therefore, it is difficult to be sure about the
number of cultural models that could be said to represent a
population, or to prescribe the number of people who ought
to share a cultural model for it to be considered dominant
within that community segment. For these reasons, we opted
for the well-known qualitative method of saturation. In-depth
interviews with women aged 75 years and older were con-
ducted sequentially, until saturation of the predetermined
topics (Liamputtong, 2009). A total of eight women were
interviewed. Although it was possible to interview more
women, it was felt that this would not enrich the study, given
that its purpose was exploratory and to conduct in-depth and
detailed analysis, with a focus on models in language, which
is a methodological learning reported by other qualitative
studies on osteoporosis (see, for example, Lettenmaier et al.,
1994; Skolbekken, Østerlie, & Forsmo, 2008).
Ethics Statement
The study was conducted in accordance with the World
Medical Association (2008) Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by the Barwon Health Human Research Ethics
Committee. All participants read and signed a participant
information and consent form prior to being interviewed.
All participant names used in this article are pseudonyms.
Data Gathering
Semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted by the
first author (R.O.) at our research facility on the Geelong
Hospital campus in central Geelong. A loose set of prede-
termined topics was used to invite participants in both
groups to describe their understanding of the condition of
osteoporosis (what it is, what causes it, whether it is treat-
able and/or preventable) and what they may have heard
others say about osteoporosis. Fracture case study partici-
pants were also asked about the circumstances of their
fracture(s); any immediate and subsequent treatment
received, including investigation for osteoporosis; their
reaction to the fracture and, if relevant, their reaction to
receiving a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Probing and follow-
up questioning were used to encourage reflection and
detailed responses. At the conclusion of the interviews,
which lasted at least 90 min, participants were prompted to
comment on anything related to osteoporosis and/or frac-
ture that had not already been covered in the discussion.
Key stakeholders were consulted to provide copies of, or
references to, print materials to which participants in our
4 SAGE Open
study, including the case studies, were likely to have been
exposed in the past 5 years. Stakeholders included local and
state government health departments, Barwon Health (the
major health services provider in the region), local medical
practitioners, pharmacies, researchers in osteoporosis, and
consumers. We also searched local media and a popular
(national) women's magazine for articles on osteoporosis.
The materials identified for inclusion in the analysis included
fact sheets, online (printable) patient information sheets,
pamphlets, booklets, and magazine articles. We selected
materials on the basis of relevance (provides information
about osteoporosis) and circulation (confidence that study
participants were exposed to, or were likely to have had
access to, one or more of the print materials over the past 5
years). The appendix provides a complete list of the 10 items
included in the study.
Data Analysis
Theories of the organization of cultural knowledge pro-
vided a framework for our analyses of the verbal data and
the print artifacts examined for the present study. Cognitive
anthropological approaches suggest that cultural models
(which we identify from what people say, or do not say) are
related to behavior "in complex, powerful ways . . . Cultural
models frame experience, supplying interpretations of that
experience and inferences about it, and goals for action"
(Quinn & Holland, 1987, p. 4). In the present context, when
we identify participants' cultural models of osteoporosis
and compare these with the cultural knowledge implicit in
the social marketing messages about osteoporosis to which
they may have been exposed, we can reasonably link these
with their behaviors in relation to osteoporosis and its man-
agement. For example, in a community in which cultural
models of osteoporosis revolve around the notion of osteo-
porosis being a result of a deficit of calcium, and social
marketing messages encourage an increase in calcium
intake, some people may be motivated to change their diet
while others may take a calcium supplement, and yet others
may do nothing. Neither the cultural model nor the social
marketing messages can be said to cause such behavioral
change (or no change), but each plays a role in influencing
the person's decision making. Since we cannot be sure
about the strength of influence, it is important to ensure that
social marketing messages are as closely aligned as possible
with cultural models held by the intended audience.
For the purposes of our analysis, we assigned the data
collected from the eight participants so they formed two col-
lective and intrinsic case studies (Silverman & Marvasti,
2008). The collective case study method involves selecting
a few cases to illustrate and analyze the topic of interest
as a single case, while the intrinsic case study method
involves selection of cases specifically for their relevance to
the study question. Together, these methods provide a
powerful means for intensive investigation. Thus, the four
participants selected to the "fracture case study" were those
who had sustained one or more fractures in the previous 5
years, and the four in the "community case study" were con-
sumer volunteers from the local community.
The interviews were audiorecorded, transcribed, and sent
to participants for verification. Once finalized, the tran-
scripts were imported into NVivo 9 (QSR International,
2010) for coding, using the constant comparative method
described by Boeije (2002). Peer review (by coauthors
M.M., J.A.P., M.A.K.) of coding schemes and conclusions
was used to check validity and dependability (Liamputtong,
2009). Once coded, the data were analyzed using Spradley's
system of domain analysis, which specifies three types of
domain: folk, mixed, and analytic (Spradley, 1979a, 1979b).
A domain is defined as "an organizing idea or concept" that
forms the basic unit in a cultural setting (Neuman, 2003).
From the folk domains (terms used by participants) in the
data, we identified a series of mixed domains: labels given
or added by the researcher to folk domains. Then, from
these mixed domains, we inferred meaningful categories
and identified patterns in the data, to which we assigned
analytic domains, or terms that encapsulated the cultural
models shared by participants. Figures 1 to 4 demonstrate
the process: Statements in the left-hand columns ("subtype/
included term") represent the mixed domains that emerged
as category labels from combinations of researcher para-
phrasing of chunks of data and the coding of participants'
statements in response to a question such as, "What is
osteoporosis?" Several further combinations of category
statements were tested to create the cover term (the cultural
model in the right-hand column) as the overarching state-
ment, and the center columns suggest its semantic relation-
ships with the mixed-domain categories. This approach is
both innovative and sensitive, in that it requires close
attention to be paid to language--of both participants and
researchers--and the relationships between specific terms
used to identify cultural meaning (Neuman, 2003).
The process described above for domain analysis of the
interview data was also used to identify cultural knowledge
implicit in the social marketing materials identified for
examination in the study, and this analysis included assess-
ment of each publication for its clarity, accuracy, and general
tone (e.g., whether the tone was informative, reassuring,
matter-of-fact, or invoked fear or anxiety).
Results
In-Depth Interviews
The four women in our fracture case study each reported
having received a diagnosis of osteoporosis and experienc-
ing multiple fractures during her adult life. Fracture sites
included wrist, hip, spine, ribs, scapula, pelvis, and foot.
Two of the women were taking prescribed osteoporosis
treatment, one was taking (self-prescribed) calcium and

vitamin D supplements, and the fourth was not taking any
medication or supplements related to fracture or osteoporo-
sis. While all four were currently living in their own homes,
two resided within a retirement village. Two women were
widowed, the third was married, and the fourth had never
married. Only one of the interviewees was born in Australia,
and she had lived in the region all her life; the others were
born in the United Kingdom, and each had resided in the
region for at least 20 years.
Data from interviews with the remaining four women
were analyzed as a comparison case study (the "community
case study"), acting as a form of verification of the fracture
case study. Three of the women in the community case study
reported having received a diagnosis of osteoporosis; two
were currently on bisphosphonate treatment as well as cal-
cium supplementation, while the third had been taken off her
bisphosphonate treatment 2 to 3 years prior to interview,
after having taken it for 10 years. This treatment cessation
was reportedly a precautionary measure on the part of her
doctor, who she said was concerned "because we don't know
the long-term problems." Although all four women reported
having fallen in the previous 12 months, none had experi-
enced a fracture in the previous 15 to 20 years, if ever. The
women were all living independently; three of these within a
Otmar et al. 7
retirement village setting. Three women were widowed,
while the fourth was married. Two were born in Australia
and had lived in the region all their lives; the other two were
born in the United Kingdom and Indonesia and had resided
in the region for 14 years and 51 years, respectively.
Identifying the Shared Cultural Model
In analyzing the data from the fracture case study, seven
subtypes (or parts of the domain) emerged in the course of
identifying the mixed and analytic domains within the
shared cultural model, "Osteoporosis has low salience": (a)
osteoporosis is not a serious disease, (b) osteoporosis has
low impact, (c) osteoporosis has many possible explana-
tions or causes, (d) osteoporosis happens to other people,
(e) a healthy/balanced lifestyle prevents osteoporosis, (f) a
diagnosis of osteoporosis does not necessarily motivate
behavioral change, and (g) the "silent" disease made
visible.
Cultural Model 1: Osteoporosis Has Low Salience
Osteoporosis is not a serious disease. Osteoporosis was not
considered to be a "serious disease" in and of itself, particu-
larly when compared with other chronic conditions. For our
participants, among the many threats to health, osteoporosis
did not rise to nearly the same level of salience and concern
as heart disease, stroke, cancer, and even arthritis. For exam-
ple, according to Petra,1
I've always thought, of all the things I've got--there's
a few things--osteoporosis is the [pause] least of my
problems . . . I've got arthritis. Now, if I had a choice
of getting rid of that or osteoporosis, I would say the
arthritis, because that hurts all the time.
Only one participant, Beulah, considered osteoporosis to
be a serious disease, second only to stroke as a threat to
health, due to the risk of fracture and consequential limita-
tions to mobility:
I felt I was coping with all the other problems that I
had, and this one [osteoporosis] is the one that has
been most limiting. So I'd put it fairly high on the
scale of "not good."
Osteoporosis has low impact. Participants were not unduly
concerned about having osteoporosis, even after receiving a
diagnosis. This was related to the first subtype ("osteoporo-
sis is not a serious disease"), both of which are consistent
with the literature on Australians' (lack of) concern about
osteoporosis, relative to other chronic conditions (Miller &
Tuffin, 2009). It also highlighted the general attitude toward
aging at this stage in participants' lives:
I see it just as part of getting older. Because you can't
get older without problems. (Katrin)
No, I don't think I am really concerned. I guess
because I'm getting to the latter end of my life, that
maybe I just think, make the most of it while I can.
(Yvette)
Osteoporosis has many possible explanations or causes.
I understand that it's a--more or less a disease of the
bone, where the bones get very porous and brittle, and
so they can break very easily . . . it's not necessarily
connected to old age, I know. But it seems to get worse
as we get older. (Yvette)
[W]hen I was sick with my ulcerative colitis and had
to have steroids, I started taking calcium then, because
I knew that [osteoporosis] was always a possibility.
(Beulah)
Participants held contradictory beliefs about the cause(s)
of osteoporosis. On one hand, there was a perception that
they themselves could exercise considerable control over
getting osteoporosis, while on the other hand, genetic factors
were viewed as paramount.
[Y]ou know, for years I didn't drink milk, or eat
cheese or butter, so I think mine is quite self-inflicted.
(Charmaine)
I guess it's something to do with the genes and
makeup of the individual person. (Yvette)
Osteoporosis happens to other people. Although they
expressed the view that osteoporosis was not alarming, par-
ticipants were surprised and initially did not believe their
diagnoses. It was something they had witnessed or heard of
in others but never expected they would have to confront.
One participant said that even though she had sustained
several fractures prior to sustaining her spinal fracture, this
singular event compelled her to accept the diagnosis of
osteoporosis.
And [the medical specialist] took one look at me, and
he said, "You've fractured your spine." And I said,
"No, I haven't." He said, "You have!"
A complete shock . . . A complete shock, because at
that time I was going to do aerobics at the gym, four
times a week. I was walking from North Geelong into
town, all the time. It was a tremendous shock, and I
wouldn't believe it. I just said, "It can't be!"
(Charmaine)
8 SAGE Open
A balanced lifestyle prevents osteoporosis. Participants
believed that a healthy person who lived a balanced lifestyle
would not get osteoporosis. This was described as having a
"good" diet and regular exercise, and together these were
thought to be protective.
A diagnosis does not necessarily motivate behavioral change.
Once a diagnosis of osteoporosis had been made, partici-
pants did not feel compelled to make significant changes to
their lifestyles.
My husband said, "You have to be more careful and not
fall." But falling is . . . an accident. You can try [to be
more careful] but it becomes very paranoid, so I don't.
No, I didn't change anything. No, nothing. (Katrin)
One woman moved very quickly from her initial reaction
of shock and disbelief to what might be described as denial
or complacency: "I think once the initial, you know, shock
that you've got it is over, then I put it to the back of the
mind." (Yvette)
The "silent" disease made visible. This subtype emerged in
analyzing both what was said as well as what was not, or
what Neuman refers to as "negative evidence" (Neuman,
2003).
Osteoporosis, you don't feel it, until you fall and break
something. (Petra)
The interview technique of "active listening" allowed the
researcher "to listen to what was said and how it [was] said"
(Liamputtong, 2009, p. 50), and then to follow up with
prompts where appropriate. Field notes provided data on
silences, indicating uncertainty or establishing unspoken
boundaries to the interview. Participants' own expressed
views of osteoporosis differed from those they ascribed to
the community. For example, in response to the question of
whether a stigma existed in the community in relation to
osteoporosis, all participants firmly denied this was the case.
Their silences suggested, "I am not one to perpetuate stigma,"
and yet they all mentioned the "dowager's hump" (kyphosis)
with not a small measure of concern, at times even dread.
I always thought from the time I was diagnosed, I'm
not going to [get a dowager's hump], I'm going to
stand up straight . . . But I've had it for all those years,
and I don't really have a dowager's hump. (Petra)
Here, while Petra has rejected the notion of community
stigma, she also expressed a relief at being spared this afflic-
tion, suggesting otherwise.
Each of the seven subtypes (or included terms) described
above has a defined semantic relationship with the cultural
model "low salience" (Figure 1). In this analysis, each of the
first six subtypes has the semantic relationship "is a reason
for" the cultural model of low salience, while the seventh
subtype has the semantic relationship "is a result of" the cul-
tural model of low salience.
Analysis of the data from the community case study
confirmed the cultural model, "Osteoporosis has low
salience," identified from the fracture case study. We also
identified an additional subtype unique to the community
case study.
Osteoporosis comes with aging and thinning of the bones.
Apart from one participant, who reported that she had no
experience or knowledge of osteoporosis, there was an
acceptance of osteoporosis as a normal and natural conse-
quence of aging.
Well, I think as you get older, you know . . . it's the
thinning of the bones; that's how I think of it, or some
people refer to it as "bone softening." (Anna)
But most people--a few people that I know have got
osteoporosis and have had falls and have had frac-
tures. But I just, personally, I see it just as part of get-
ting older. Because you can't get older without
problems. (Katrin)
Print Materials
The cultural knowledge underpinning the messages in the
print materials were categorized into three distinct mes-
sages; using the same process as for the cultural models, we
identified several subtypes describing each message.
Message 1: Osteoporosis Is a Serious But
Preventable Condition.Treatment Is Available
Within this message, osteoporosis was identified as a serious
but preventable condition for which effective tests and
medications were available. While the texts were not explicit
in their use of the term serious, and none described osteopo-
rosis as a "disease," the seriousness of the condition was
conveyed through the tone and presentation of content about
osteoporosis, and by the organizational branding associated
with health care. The print materials produced by Barwon
Health, Better Health Channel, Osteoporosis Australia, and
the pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp & Dohme pre-
sented messages that fitted within this cultural conception.
The pamphlet by Osteoporosis Australia was designed and
targeted specifically for men. However, it was included in
the study since it had been identified by a stakeholder as a
"good" resource on osteoporosis to which participants in the
study may have been exposed in the previous 5 years. While
the pamphlet included facts and information about risk fac-
tors for osteoporosis in men, it also included clear informa-
tion about osteoporosis in general and the importance of
vitamin D in the maintenance of healthy bones.
Osteoporosis is a weakening of the bone or bone structure.
The print materials each provided a clear and unambiguous
definition of osteoporosis.
Otmar et al. 9
Osteoporosis is a condition where bone structure
deteriorates . . . the outer bone "shell" becomes thin
. . . weakening the bones and increasing the risk of
fracture. (Barwon Health)
Osteoporosis means "bones with holes." Bones lose
their strength and density, become fragile and break
(fracture) more easily. (Better Health Channel)
Osteoporosis is a condition where bones become
weakened and fracture more easily than normal bone.
(Osteoporosis Australia)
There are many risk factors for osteoporosis. The materials
were explicit in the view that there was no single cause or
factor that placed a person at risk for osteoporosis. Each pub-
lication in this group listed a range of risk factors, and identi-
fied those people who might be at higher risk of osteoporosis.
They also debunked common myths about osteoporosis
being "a women's disease," highlighting that both men and
women could be at risk.
Several factors can place a person at risk of osteopo-
rosis. . . . Sex hormones . . . have a fundamental role
in maintaining bone strength in men and women.
(Better Health Channel)
Who is at risk? Both men and women older than 20
years, but especially over 50 years of age. (Barwon
Health)
Osteoporosis is preventable. Each publication answered an
explicit question about whether osteoporosis could be pre-
vented but did not apportion blame or accusation at those
who did not follow the recommendations for doing so, for
example, "Some things you can do now to maintain or
increase strength of bones and help protect against osteopo-
rosis (followed by a list; Barwon Health).
Osteoporosis can be diagnosed and treated. All four publi-
cations provided clear and relatively detailed information
on how osteoporosis might be investigated and diagnosed,
and described the range of available medications and other
interventions. Implicit within these materials was the
message--delivered in a reassuring tone--that effective
treatments were available.
Diagnostic densitometry and specialist endocrinologists
are available for referrals to treat and monitor patients
with osteoporosis and fractures. (Barwon Health)
If osteoporosis is diagnosed early and effective treat-
ments are used, bone loss can be prevented from get-
ting worse. (Osteoporosis Australia)
If I need treatment, what's available? There's one fact
that you really should know about osteoporosis: it's
never too late to start . . . Today, there are several treat-
ments available which may help strengthen your
bones. (Merck Sharp & Dohme)
Message 2: Osteoporosis Is a Common Problem
Among OlderWomen.We Should AllTry to Maintain
Healthy Bones
Within this message, osteoporosis was defined as a problem
commonly occurring among women at or after menopause.
Medications as well as lifestyle factors--essentially, having
a diet rich in calcium and regular exercise--were presented
as solutions to treating the problem. Readers were repeat-
edly urged to check their intake of calcium and to seek
medical advice about osteoporosis. The four print materials
developed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and the Australian
Dairy Corporation (one of these in conjunction with Arthritis
Foundation of Australia) published messages that fitted
within this cultural conception.
Osteoporosis is a common problem. Although this was not
explicitly stated in the publications, they gave the strong
impression of osteoporosis being a common occurrence in
the community. There was also a sense of heightening read-
ers' awareness of a pervasive problem.
Approximately every 5 to 6 minutes someone is
admitted to an Australian hospital with an osteoporotic
fracture. . . . You may have osteoporosis and not know
it. (Novartis Pharmaceuticals)
The longer we live the more likely we are to
develop osteoporosis. . . . Osteoporosis is an increas-
ing health care problem in all aging communities.
(Australian Dairy Corporation)
Older women are at high risk. Along with the pervasive
presence of osteoporosis in the community was the message
in the publications that women were at considerable risk,
particularly from the onset of menopause. Statements about
men also being at risk were obscured by the repetition of
descriptions of women's risk.
More than half of older Australian women will suffer
an osteoporotic fracture during their lifetime. (Novartis
Pharmaceuticals)
Who are at risk from osteoporosis? . . . Caucasian (fair
skinned) and Asian women . . . Women after meno-
pause and women having an early menopause. Women
who have dieted excessively. (Australian Dairy
Corporation)
Healthy bones are the responsibility of the individual person.
The four publications presented the universal message that
healthy bones were attainable if the individual person
10 SAGE Open
followed certain recommendations. They did not provide
guidance outside of those recommendations, but did state
that readers should seek medical advice if they had
concerns.
To prevent fractures you need to keep your bones
strong. (Novartis Pharmaceuticals)
The recommended calcium intake chart is a general
guide to the amount of calcium we should be eating
daily according to our age. Check to see whether you
are getting enough calcium daily. (Australian Dairy
Corporation; Australian Dairy Corporation and
Arthritis Foundation of Australia)
Healthy bones are achieved or maintained through this prod-
uct. Not only were healthy bones attainable, but they were
attainable through the use or consumption of a particular
product or product type. This subtype appeared to reflect the
publishers'commercial and/or other interest in producing the
publication, for example, the Australian Dairy Corporation's
interest in promoting dairy products.
Your doctor has prescribed Aclasta® to treat your
osteoporosis. (Novartis Pharmaceuticals)
It is easy to aim for two, three, or four serves of dairy
products daily in a balanced diet, and . . . there are
manylowfatdairyproductstochoosefrom.(Australian
Dairy Corporation)
Dairy foods are best because they are especially high
in calcium. (Australian Dairy Corporation andArthritis
Foundation of Australia)
Message 3: Dieting Gave Me Osteoporosis
The two articles by Woman's Day magazine fitted within a
cultural conception of osteoporosis as an alarming disease
that could be visited on young women at any given moment,
either through no fault of their own, or due to having an
unhealthy body image. Within this message, osteoporosis
was not so much defined as dramatized into a life-threaten-
ing condition.
Osteoporosis can be crippling and life threatening. The arti-
cles presented a consistent view that osteoporosis was a
cause for alarm.
Former model and actress Britt Ekland . . . weight loss
has left her crippled with osteoporosis. (October 2007)
[The medical specialist] told me I might only have
been a day away from not being here at all. . . .
Basically, my body was shutting down. (June, 2007)
Osteoporosis is caused by body image OR You can get
osteoporosis through no fault of your own. The Woman's Day
articles present conflicting views on the possible cause(s) of
osteoporosis. On one hand, a pervasive desire for a "size
zero" body among young women was the cause of dieting,
which in turn caused osteoporosis: "`Dieting is why I now
have osteoporosis', she [Britt Ekland] tells British newspa-
per Daily Express. Britt says she was plagued by body
image problems from an early age" (October 2007).
On the other hand, osteoporosis was presented as a mys-
terious condition that could arise without prior warning:
"The X-rays did in fact show that this otherwise fit, healthy
30-year-old had severe osteoporosis. . . . We don't really
know why I developed osteoporosis." (June 2007)
Young women should be careful. Both articles highlighted
that young women were at risk of getting osteoporosis.
Sue is now determined to let younger women know
that osteoporosis can happen . . . at any age. (June,
2007)
Britt hopes her story will serve as a warning to young
women today. (October 2007)
Discussion
The four cultural concepts that emerged in the present analy-
sis--the cultural model that "Osteoporosis has low salience"
and the messages that "Osteoporosis is a serious but prevent-
able condition for which treatment is available";
"Osteoporosis is a common problem among older women,
we should all try to maintain healthy bones"; and "Dieting
gave me osteoporosis"--highlight the range of views on
osteoporosis present in our community of interest. There
were clearly discernible differences as well as similarities
between the cultural model identified among the study par-
ticipants and the messages that emerged from analysis of the
print materials included in the study.
Our findings from the fracture case study concur with
international studies indicating a high level of disinterest in
osteoporosis among middle-aged and older women. In a
qualitative study conducted in Scotland, Backett-Milburn,
Parry, and Mauthner (2000) were surprised to find that only
a minority of the women in their study, aged 40 to 55 years,
mentioned osteoporosis without prompting, and when they
did so there was little interest in osteoporosis as a health con-
cern (Backett-Milburn et al., 2000). Similar findings were
indicated by Meadows and colleagues in Canada (Meadows,
Mrkonjic, & Lagendyk, 2005; Meadows, Mrkonjic, Petersen,
& Lagendyk, 2004), and Reventlow and Bang (2006) in
Denmark, where women's views of osteoporosis were found
to be influenced by stereotypes of aging and inevitable
bodily decay.
Otmar et al. 11
It is interesting to note that while osteoporosis was simi-
larly of low salience among our community case study, these
participants were more sanguine about osteoporosis than
those in the fracture case study, considering osteoporosis to
be a condition caused by age-related thinning of the bones.
While this difference between the groups was subtle, it is nev-
ertheless an important distinction; the women in the fracture
case study had firsthand experience of the consequences of
bone fragility that they did not put down to aging, even if
their level of concern about osteoporosis matched that of par-
ticipants in the community case study.
Our findings from both case studies also concur with a
major Australian study suggesting that osteoporosis is con-
sidered to be of low salience within the general community.
The Australian Better Health Initiative (BHI), announced in
2006, is a large-scale, national communications strategy
that uses the threat of chronic disease to motivate lifestyle
change among Australians. The primary target for the first
phase of the BHI campaign involved 25- to 50-year-olds,
and the secondary target 45- to 65-year-olds. In the cam-
paign's baseline survey (n = 2,506), respondents had ranked
osteoporosis 14th in a list of 18 chronic diseases (Miller &
Tuffin, 2009). Thus, it would be fair to say that osteoporosis
ranks relatively low among Australians' health concerns,
and this is reflected within our case study sample.
The cultural model "Osteoporosis has low salience"
included a strong association with the dreaded "dowager's
hump" held by the women in the case studies in relation to
osteoporosis. Nevertheless, this association was not sufficient
cause for osteoporosis to be prioritized among the women's
health concerns. The Norwegian HUNT study provides an
interesting contrast; the women in that study also were
reported as holding strong associations between osteoporosis
and "hunchedback bodies" (Skolbekken et al., 2008, p. 2570),
but they appeared to express far greater concern and curiosity
about the condition than did their Australian counterparts--
though it is possible that this was as a result of the high level
of support for the HUNT study reported among residents of
the county in which the study is located.
Notwithstanding the above, why was osteoporosis con-
sidered to be of low salience among Australian partici-
pants, given that all but one had received a diagnosis of
osteoporosis? One reason could be a lack of knowledge
about the condition, as suggested by the study cited in our
introduction (Taylor et al., 2003). A case in point was one
participant in the community case study who had never
experienced a fracture and reported having no knowledge
of osteoporosis.
Given their recent fracture history, perhaps it would not
be unreasonable to expect that participants in the fracture
case study would rate osteoporosis higher in their list of
health concerns. However, if their fracture experience did
not result in a change in their knowledge of the condition, it
is perhaps unlikely that it changed their perception of its
salience. A recent Australian study by Levinson and col-
leagues assessed elderly patients'knowledge of osteoporosis
during and 3 months after hospital admission for minimal
trauma fracture (Levinson, Leeuwrik, Oldroyd, & Staples,
2012). Levinson et al. (2012) found that knowledge of osteo-
porosis did not improve in the 3 months after fracture, and
concluded that "current strategies for patient education in
osteoporosis did not result in increased patient knowledge
about their disease."
Concomitant with our speculation above that fracture
case study participants might rate osteoporosis relatively
high on their list of health concerns due to their fracture his-
tory is the notion that the strength of participants' views
about osteoporosis and its management may be dependent
on the proximity of their encounters with the concept of
osteoporosis. This might include how long ago partici-
pants--or a family member or friend--received a diagnosis
of osteoporosis, visited a doctor for a condition that might
have exposed them to discussions or health-promotion
materials about osteoporosis, or otherwise were exposed to
any form of dialogue or information about it.
Another reason for the low salience may be that the
women's own lived experiences were incongruent with
the messages they received about osteoporosis from their
medical practitioners and/or social marketing materials they
may have encountered. Like the women in Barg and Grier's
study (2008), they may believe that these messages do not
apply to them because the components of their cultural
model of osteoporosis are not addressed in those messages.
This was evident in the fracture case study, but not in the
community case study. We speculate that views among the
fracture case study differed precisely because of partici-
pants' recent fracture experiences. Social marketing mes-
sages could be made more relevant to women such as our
participants by segmentation or targeting (Kreuter et al.,
2000) that addresses their age/life stage, fracture history,
and knowledge. For example, a pamphlet provided to elderly
women attending a fracture clinic could focus on interven-
tions to prevent a recurrence of fracture, while one provided
to elderly women attending a general medical practice
would need to provide more basic information relevant to
primary prevention of osteoporosis in older women.
We note that this discussion occurs within a societal
framework in which the dominant discourse is one of equity
in the doctor­patient partnership in health, that consumers
are empowered through access to quality information
(Henwood, Wyatt, Hart, & Smith, 2003). However, it does
not necessarily follow that consumers empowered with
information--quality or otherwise--will translate their
knowledge into positive health behaviors.
A further complicating factor linked to consumer health
behaviors relates to the capacity to access health information
and, by extension, the relationship to health outcomes.
Access to health information is increasingly universalized
12 SAGE Open
through the ubiquity of the Internet, but this access is medi-
ated by socioeconomic factors such as income and employ-
ment status (Reinfeld-Kirkman, Kalucy, & Roeger, 2010).
The relationship between socioeconomic status and health
outcomes is a topic that has attracted much attention in
research in recent decades (Huguet, Kaplan, & Feeny, 2008)
and may well be a salient factor in how people respond to
health communications about osteoporosis. However, stud-
ies on the relationship between socioeconomic status and
health outcomes among older people are only just beginning
to emerge in relation to chronic conditions such as hyperten-
sion (Kaplan, Huguet, Feeny, & McFarland, 2010), and a
gap remains in relation to income disparity and the preva-
lence of osteoporosis.
Social Marketing and Osteoporosis
The print materials provided by key stakeholders for inclu-
sion in the study did not send a universal message about
osteoporosis. As might be expected, the materials produced
by the publicly funded health and information providers
(Barwon Health, Better Health Channel, and Osteoporosis
Australia) presented messages that were clear, balanced,
informative, and reassuring, while those obtained from other
sources (pharmaceutical companies, the dairy industry, and
Woman's Day magazine) ranged from laissez-faire state-
ments about osteoporosis and its management to fear-based
exhortations for young women to "be careful." The fact
sheet produced by pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp &
Dohme was a notable exception, although it was specifically
produced for general medical practitioners (this fact sheet
was included in the analysis because a general medical prac-
titioner stakeholder had offered it as evidence of information
he provided to his patients when diagnosing osteoporosis).
While the first two messages in this section of the analy-
sis appeared to be similar, there was one major difference:
the balanced and reassuring approach taken by the public
health and information providers, as opposed to the com-
mercially laden messages presented by the pharmaceutical
and dairy industry representatives. Both messages presented
current and accurate data on the prevalence of osteoporosis,
but the communication of this information in Message 2
("Osteoporosis is a common problem among older women,
we should all try to maintain healthy bones") could have led
readers to believe that osteoporosis was far more prevalent
than it really was. Older women, in particular, were the
focus of these messages. Furthermore, there was a strong
emphasis in Message 2 on the individual's responsibility to
maintain healthy bones, primarily through calcium supple-
mentation and osteoporosis medication, and this message
was reflected in Cultural Model 1, where some women
believed that osteoporosis was lifestyle-related and there-
fore self-inflicted.
Message 3 ("Dieting gave me osteoporosis") took a dis-
tinctly different approach to communicating about osteopo-
rosis. In these magazine articles, osteoporosis was presented
as a mysterious disease to which young women in particular
should be alerted. Neither article gave any indication of the
known risk factors for osteoporosis, nor its recommended
treatment or management. The cultural knowledge conveyed
through Message 3, thus, did not reflect the available scien-
tific evidence on osteoporosis, and they also did not reflect
Australian policies on raising awareness of the condition.
In 2002, the Australian Government committed AU$11.5
million over 4 years to "osteoporosis awareness raising,
support for better self-management and health service
improvements," and in 2006, that funding was extended
for a further 4 years (Australian Government, 2006). Under
the 2006 to 2010 Better Arthritis and Osteoporosis Care
program, activities for osteoporosis included a "Prevent the
next fracture" awareness program, a vertebral fracture ini-
tiative for general medical practitioners and consumers, an
osteoporosis self-management training module, a national
osteoporosis multicultural initiative, a vitamin D and cal-
cium awareness program, a national dissemination project
for the healthy bones school kit, a national osteoporosis risk
factors awareness program, a "Men and Osteoporosis" pro-
gram, a National Patient Support program, and an evaluated
program of community service announcements (Australian
Government, 2010). In 2005, the Vitamin D and Calcium
Forum, a joint initiative of Osteoporosis Australia and the
Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society,
developed recommendations aimed at achieving improved
vitamin D and calcium nutrition among Australians; a range
of publications targeted to consumer and professional audi-
ences was published as a result (Osteoporosis Australia and
Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society,
2005).
Considering the findings presented in this article, it
appears that not much of these extensive social marketing
programs have penetrated our study region. While there
were some scant references in the print materials analyzed at
Messages 1 and 2, none of the messages in these campaigns
was reflected in the articles analyzed at Message 3. Having
said that, though, it is difficult to obtain clear evidence either
way in the research literature; there remains a dearth of
research evaluating social marketing campaigns on osteopo-
rosis--the messages imparted as well as their uptake--
within the country generally, and specifically in the study
region.
The cultural model identified from our case studies,
"Osteoporosis has low salience," did not differ as notably as
it diverged from Messages 1 and 2. Given participants' view
of osteoporosis as having low salience, the cultural knowl-
edge in Message 1 that osteoporosis was in fact a serious
condition and in Message 2 that it was common among older
women might hardly have provided reasons for participants
to reprioritize osteoporosis above the health conditions and
diseases they had placed ahead of it. Although we do not
have evidence that our participants specifically were (or
were not) exposed to the print materials analyzed in our
study, it is not difficult to see how Messages 1 and 2 may
Otmar et al. 13
have missed the mark with them. The materials were not par-
ticularly well targeted toward women of their age, and there-
fore participants may not have considered these as being
relevant to them (Barg & Grier, 2008; Buckley & Ó Tuama,
2010).
Cultural Model 1 ("Osteoporosis has low salience") and
Message 1 ("Dieting gave me osteoporosis") could be seen
as representing two views on opposite extremes regarding
osteoporosis. It is unlikely that the alarmist targeting of
young women in Message 3 would have swayed our partici-
pants'views from osteoporosis as a condition of low salience
to one that might be life threatening. The use of a former
model now aged in her 60s would be unlikely to provide the
desired connection with the targeted audience of young
women. As shown by Buckley and Ó Tuama, a recent trend
toward the use of celebrities in testimonial-style health pro-
motion could have the unwanted effect of "heighten[ing]
feelings of disconnection" (Buckley & Ó Tuama, 2010).
Women's magazines have long been recognized as strong
influencers in women's health education. An extensive body
of research has established the importance of this medium in
empowering women to be informed about their bodies, their
health, and as consumers of health care (Barnett, 2006;
Weston & Ruggiero, 1985-1986; Zuckerman, 1998). Thus,
the cultural knowledge identified from the print materials in
this study, particularly the women's magazine, could be said
to be reinforcing of a perception of the low salience of osteo-
porosis--clearly an unintended, negative consequence from
the perspective of the authors.
Target MarketingVersus Nontarget Marketing
In the psychology of market effects, persuasion is enhanced
when there is a match between the message and the target
market, while "negative nonmarket effects" may occur
when there is not (Aaker, Brumbaugh, & Grier, 2000). In
the case of osteoporosis, this presents a strong argument for
the development of health messages based on the target
market's cultural model(s) of osteoporosis. By nature of
their proximity, older women living in our study region will
have shared experiences and problems, so it is not unrea-
sonable to expect that they might have a shared model of
osteoporosis and that this model might overlap with the one
identified among the women in our study, albeit a small
sample. Thus, key features of a shared cultural model might
be used effectively to target older women in the region with
social marketing messages and interventions that aim to
prevent or treat osteoporosis. As already stated, if these
features are not taken into account, older women in the
community might think that the messages and interventions
they encounter about osteoporosis do not apply to them
(Barg & Grier, 2008) and that they do not need to change
their behaviors in relation to osteoporosis.
The cultural model of osteoporosis that emerged from our
case studies emphasized the low salience, or low promi-
nence, of osteoporosis among older women, including those
with a diagnosis of osteoporosis and those who had recently
experienced fracture. While it is important to note that the
views and attitudes represent the women in our sample at
this specific age and stage in life, nevertheless, they point to
key features of programs and policies developed in the pre-
vention and treatment of chronic conditions such as
osteoporosis.
Strengths and Limitations
A significant strength is that this is the only study we know
of that has explored and compared cultural models of osteo-
porosis among consumers and cultural knowledge of the
condition as represented in social marketing campaigns, in
Australia as well as internationally. However, we empha-
size the exploratory nature of the study and the limitations
inherent in the small sample. Qualitative explorative studies
can offer a deep understanding of the mental or cultural
models underlying people's thoughts or beliefs about a phe-
nomenon, which can be used as a focus for communication
about that phenomenon. The case studies presented in this
article provide some insights into knowledge, beliefs,
attitudes, and cultural models of osteoporosis, and highlight
divergent messages implicit in social marketing campaigns
implemented through print materials. These findings cannot
be generalized to the broader population. Given the consid-
erable gap in the literature evaluating social marketing
campaigns and messages related to osteoporosis prevention
and treatment, the study signals a need for further research
to determine the prevalence of the cultural knowledge high-
lighted in the present analysis, as well as others extant in the
community. Indeed, culture represents a significant gap in
the research of health communications (Barg & Grier,
2008). Future research also might helpfully provide com-
prehensive content analyses of key social marketing cam-
paigns on osteoporosis--in print and nonprint formats--and
examine behavioral responses to these. We are acutely
aware of the fact that participants in our study may have
been exposed to other print campaigns as well as a range of
nonprint campaigns, including television advertisements for
calcium supplements and dairy products, and this presents a
substantial opportunity for future research. A further gap,
the perspectives of medical practitioners, is currently being
explored in our main study.
Conclusion
We identified cultural models as a novel approach to under-
standing consumer perspectives of osteoporosis and com-
paring these with cultural knowledge implicit in social
marketing print materials. It is clear that consumer knowl-
edge, understanding, attitudes, and behaviors regarding
osteoporosis need to be improved to reduce its vast health
burden. But social marketers, too, can benefit from having a
deeper understanding of the cultural models that drive con-
sumer knowledge and behaviors in relation to osteoporosis.
14 SAGE Open
We echo Barg and Grier (2008) in calling for "prevention
models that consider consumers' lived experiences." Our
findings suggest that broadly formulated marketing mes-
sages designed to reach mass audiences may have unin-
tended negative consequences, and that cultural models can
be used in developing appropriately targeted, salient mes-
sages.
