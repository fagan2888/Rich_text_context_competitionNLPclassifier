Time use choices and healthy body weight: A
multivariate analysis of data from the American
Time use Survey
Cathleen D Zick1*, Robert B Stevens1 and W Keith Bryant2
Abstract
Background: We examine the relationship between time use choices and healthy body weight as measured by
survey respondents' body mass index (BMI). Using data from the 2006 and 2007 American Time Use Surveys, we
expand upon earlier research by including more detailed measures of time spent eating as well as measures of
physical activity time and sedentary time. We also estimate three alternative models that relate time use to BMI.
Results: Our results suggest that time use and BMI are simultaneously determined. The preferred empirical model
reveals evidence of an inverse relationship between time spent eating and BMI for women and men. In contrast,
time spent drinking beverages while simultaneously doing other things and time spent watching television/videos
are positively linked to BMI. For women only, time spent in food preparation and clean-up is inversely related to
BMI while for men only, time spent sleeping is inversely related to BMI. Models that include grocery prices,
opportunity costs of time, and nonwage income reveal that as these economic variables increase, BMI declines.
Conclusions: In this large, nationally representative data set, our analyses that correct for time use endogeneity
reveal that the Americans' time use decisions have implications for their BMI. The analyses suggest that both
eating time and context (i.e., while doing other tasks simultaneously) matters as does time spent in food
preparation, and time spent in sedentary activities. Reduced form models suggest that shifts in grocery prices,
opportunity costs of time, and nonwage income may be contributing to alterations in time use patterns and food
choices that have implications for BMI.
Keywords: Body mass index, time use, time spent eating, physical (in)activity time, wage rates, and grocery prices
Background
The upward trend in the fraction of American adults
who are overweight or obese is one of the foremost
public health concerns in the United States today.a The
National Center for Health Statistics reports that over
the past 45 years the prevalence of adult overweight
(including obesity) has grown from 44.8% to 66.9% [1].b
Overweight and obesity are known risk factors for a
number of life-threatening health conditions including
coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and type 2
diabetes. As a consequence, the increasing prevalence of
Americans' weight problems portends a future where
the billions of dollars we currently spend on overweight
and obesity-related health care [2] will continue to grow
and life expectancy may actually begin to decline [3].
In an effort to identify the correlates of Americans'
growing overweight/obesity risk, few studies have exam-
ined the relationship between time use and BMI. Those
studies that do investigate the role that time use may play
generally fall into two categories. The first category
includes studies where the focus is on time spent in physi-
cal activity and/or inactivity as it relates to BMI while the
second category includes studies where the focus is on
time spent eating and BMI.
Cross-sectional studies of physical activity time and
BMI conclude that higher levels of physical activity are
associated with lower BMI [4-6]. Other researchers have
focused exclusively on television-viewing time or sleep

time and BMI as each of these activities account for sig-
nificant fractions of Americans' physically inactive time
[7]. Studies focused on television/video viewing find that
television time is positively related to BMI [8-10]. Those
that have examined the relationship between sleep time
and BMI find an inverse relationship between sleep time
and BMI in the cross-section but not longitudinally
[11-13].
Several studies have examined the relationship between
sedentary behavior, physical activity, and BMI. One study
finds a positive relationship between television viewing
time and abdominal obesity risk even after controlling
for leisure-related physical activity [14]. Using data from
the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), another study
finds that individuals who spend less than 60 minutes per
day watching television/videos and who spend more than
60 minutes per day in moderate-to-vigorous leisure time
physical activity have significantly lower BMIs, than
otherwise comparable respondents who report spending
fewer than 60 minutes watching television/videos and
spending less than 60 minutes in moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity [15]. Research that makes use of data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) finds that physical activity and inac-
tivity (measured by steps per day and time) vary signifi-
cantly across normal weight, overweight, and obese
individuals [16]. Finally, data from a cross-sectional Aus-
tralian study reveal significant interaction effects of
leisure-time sedentary and physical activities as they
relate to overweight/obesity risk [17].
Fewer studies assess the relationship between time
spent eating and BMI. Bertrand and Schanzenbach [18]
surveyed adult women who completed a recall time
diary, a dietary time diary, and reported their height and
weight. Their study focuses on describing the eating con-
text for normal and overweight women. They report that
among overweight women, more calories are consumed
while doing chores, socializing, relaxing, watching televi-
sion, caring for others, and shopping [18].c While their
low cooperation rate (17 percent) and the focus only on
women limits the generalizability of their study's findings,
the results are nonetheless suggestive that secondary eat-
ing (i.e., eating when something else, such as television
viewing, is the primary focus of an individual's time) may
be linked to an increase in BMI. This contention is also
supported by nutrition studies that have found that peo-
ple tend to consume more calories when they are simul-
taneously engaged in other activities [19-24].
Hamermesh [25] uses ATUS data to explore the rela-
tionship between the price of time, time spent in pri-
mary eating and secondary eating spells (i.e., what he
calls "grazing" time), the number of spells, and BMI.
Using only the observations from employed individuals
who report their usual weekly earnings and their usual
weekly hours worked, he finds a significant inverse rela-
tionship between primary eating time and BMI. How-
ever, when number of primary eating spells is also
included, the average duration of primary eating is no
longer statistically significant. In addition, both average
secondary spell duration and number of spells of sec-
ondary eating are generally insignificant [25].
In the research that follows, we build on these earlier
studies to present a more complete picture of how time
use choices may be affecting Americans' BMI. Our
research builds on past investigations in several ways.
First, we investigate the relationship between BMI and a
range of time use categories that have typically only been
examined in isolation. Specifically, we focus on physical
activity time, television/video viewing time, sleep time, pri-
mary eating time, secondary eating time, and food pre-
paration time. Second, we estimate two alternative models
that allow for simultaneity in the choices individuals make
about time use and BMI - something that has not been
previously done. Third, we do not place any gender or
employment restrictions on the sample respondents thus
enhancing the external validity of our findings.
Methods
The 2006 and 2007 American Time Use Surveys
Data for the current investigation come from the 2006 and
2007 public-use files of American Time Use Surveys
(ATUS) and have the advantage of providing valid, reliable
measures of time spent in both energy intake and energy
expenditure related activities over one 24-hour period
[26,27]. The extraordinary level of detail in the ATUS
allows us to separate time spent eating into time spent eat-
ing where eating is the respondent's primary focus and
secondary eating time (i.e., time when the respondent's
primary activity was something other than eating, but
when eating was still taking place).
ATUS respondents are drawn from households that had
completed their final interview for the Current Population
Survey in the preceding 2-5 months. Each respondent is
randomly selected from among each household's mem-
bers, age 15 and older. Half complete a diary for a weekday
and half complete a diary for a weekend day.
Information from the ATUS interviews is linked to
information from the 2006 and 2007 Eating and Health
module interviews [28,29] so that we also have data on
the respondent's height and weight. BMI is calculated
from self-reported weight in kilograms divided by self-
reported height in meters squared. It should be noted
that although self-reported BMI has been commonly
used in past studies [30-34], some have found that it
results in a modest under-estimation of overweight and/
or obesity rates [35-37] while others have found it to be
a valid and reliable way to measure BMI for nonelderly
adults [38].

We restrict our ATUS sample to those respondents who
are between the ages of 25 and 64, inclusive. Younger
respondents are excluded so as to avoid the inclusion of
individuals whose eating habits may be dictated by their
parents. Respondents over age 64 are excluded because
these individuals are more likely to have health conditions
that may affect some aspects of their time use. We also
restrict our sample to those respondents whose BMI
ranges from 16.0 to 60.0, inclusive. These BMI restrictions
lead to the elimination of 5 male respondents (1 with BMI
> 60.0 and 4 with BMIs < 16.0) and 17 female respondents
(5 with BMIs >60.0 and 12 with BMIs < 16.0). In addition,
we eliminate 12 respondents who report spending more
than 15 hours being physically active, 18 respondents
who report spending more than 20 hours sleeping and 4
respondents who report spending more than 20 hours
watching television. These restrictions are made to reduce
the potential influence of leverage points and outliers.
Finally, we exclude women who are pregnant as their
reported BMIs are likely not reflective of their usual BMIs.
These sample restrictions result in a sample of 8,856
women and 7,586 men in our study.
We focus on seven time-use categories that are poten-
tially related to energy balance. The first category mea-
sures the amount of primary time the respondent spends
eating and drinking (i.e., time where eating and drinking
has her/his primary attention).d Secondary eating time is
captured by the amount of time the respondent reports
eating as a secondary activity (i.e., time where something
else has her/his primary attention). Secondary time spent
drinking anything other than plain water is measured
separately. Other food related activities are measured by
the time spent in food preparation and clean-up excluding
related travel time.
Physical activity cannot be adequately measured by
simply summing the time respondents report spending
in exercise and sports as we would end up omitting
things like bicycling to work, chasing after a toddler,
and doing physically demanding household chores.
Thus, rather than use only time spent in the ATUS
sports and exercise categories, we sum time spent in all
activities in the ATUS activity lexicon that generate
metabolic equivalents (METs) of 3.3 or more. We select
these activities based on the work done by Tudor-Locke
et al. [39] who have linked the ATUS time use lexicon
to the Compendium of Physical Activities. We choose a
threshold of 3.3 METs because this captures activities
such as exterior house cleaning, lawn and garden work,
caring for and helping household children, playing
sports with household children, active transportation
time (i.e., walking or biking), as well as most forms of
sports, exercise, and recreation. It excludes such routine
household activities such as interior housekeeping and
playing with children in non-sports.e The compendium
also identifies time spent in certain occupations (i.e.,
building and grounds cleaning and maintenance, farm-
ing, construction and extraction) as generating a mini-
mum of 3.3 METs. To control for occupational physical
activity requirements, we include a dummy variable in
the male equation that takes on a value of "1" if the
respondent works in one of these occupational cate-
gories. Only a handful of female respondents report
working in these fields and thus we exclude this dummy
from the female regressions. We sum only spells of 10
minutes or more of physical activity time because prior
work has established 10 minutes as the minimum dura-
tion necessary to impact an individual's energy balance
[40].
Finally, we use two measures of inactivity: television/
video viewing time and time spent sleeping. These two
measures have been associated with BMI and/or obesity
risk in previous studies that have related single cate-
gories of time use to BMI [8,9,11-14].
Analysis Approach
To examine the relationship between time use and BMI,
ideally one would have longitudinal data on time use in
various activities. Unfortunately, longitudinal time diary
data do not exist. While some surveys do gather infor-
mation on typical time use, methodological research has
shown such questions provide less valid and reliable
measures when compared to diary data [26,27,41].
Conceptually, cross-sectional time diary data of the
type available in the ATUS have two disadvantages.
First, time spent in various activities on any given day
may deviate from an individual's usual time use pat-
terns. As such, there is measurement error in the inde-
pendent time use variables that likely bias the coefficient
estimates toward zero [42]. Second, any observed asso-
ciation between time use and BMI obtained using cross-
sectional data may reflect reverse causality. For example,
having a high BMI may lead one to spend less time
being physically active. To address both data shortcom-
ings, we adopt a model of time use where BMI and time
use are simultaneously determined.
In our model, BMI is a function of time use, biologi-
cal traits (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, health status)
and socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., marital sta-
tus, number of children, employment status, and educa-
tion). Decisions about how much time to spend in
various activities is a function of household roles (e.g.,
self-identification as the primary meal preparer, self-
identification as the primary grocery shopper), structural
factors (e.g., number of children in the home, marital
status, employment status, gender, race/ethnicity, age,
weekend or weekday diary, season of the year, rural
residence, region of residence), prices (e.g., the respon-
dent's wage rate, grocery prices), and income.

Data on wage rates in the ATUS are limited to those
individuals who report both hours of work and earnings.
To avoid the possibility of selection bias that could be
introduced by excluding those who are not employed,
we elect to use predicted hourly opportunity costs of
time generated from wage regressions estimated using
the corresponding years of the March Supplement to
the Current Population Survey (CPS). We use indivi-
duals age 25-64 in the March Supplement to estimate
wage equations that correct for sample selection bias
using the techniques developed by James Heckman [43].
Equations are estimated separately for women and men
using the appropriate CPS weights. Coefficients from
these equations are used to generate predicted hourly
opportunity cost of time for each individual in our
ATUS sample. A random error is added to each pre-
dicted wage based on a mean of zero and a variance
that is equal to the variance of the estimating equation.f
Estimates of offered wage rates provide approximate
opportunity cost estimates of the value of time for
employed individuals and lower-bound estimates of the
value of time for non-employed individuals [43].
The ATUS contains a categorical measure of annual
household income. The categorical nature of this variable
coupled with item-specific non-response made it less
than ideal to use on our analyses. Consequently, we again
turn to the March Supplement to the CPS. For indivi-
duals age 25-64, we estimate a regression using the
appropriate CPS weights where total, annual nonwage
income for the household is the dependent variable.
Coefficients from this equation are then used to generate
predicted nonwage income values for our sample of
respondents in the ATUS. A random error is added to
each predicted nonwage income value based on a mean
of zero and a variance that is equal to the variance of the
estimating equation.g
Grocery price information comes from the Council for
Community and Economic Research's (C2ER) state-
based cost of living index for 2006 and 2007. C2ER pro-
vides expenditure weighted, quarterly metropolitan and
micropolitan price information [44].h The only detailed
geographic information contained in the ATUS is the
respondent's state of residence and residential urbanicity.
Thus, our linkage of grocery price information is done
based on information about the respondent's state of
residence, urban/rural status, and the quarter in which
the respondent was interviewed. In those rare cases
where the respondent was located in a micro area within
a state that had no micro grocery price index, we use the
state-wide average. Initially, we also included an index
measuring non-grocery prices but this was dropped from
our analyses once it was determined that the simple cor-
relation between the grocery price index and the non-
grocery price index was .89.
We estimate three different sets of equations sepa-
rately for men and women. In the first formulation, we
estimate a model where our time use measures are trea-
ted as predetermined variables that affect BMI. We then
estimate an instrumental variables model that recognizes
that the time use and BMI causality may run in both
directions when one is analyzing cross-sectional data of
the sort used here. In the final formulation, we estimate
reduced form models of BMI. In this formulation, BMI
is estimated as a function of the biological and socio-
demographic variables and the strictly exogenous factors
that are posited to affect time use [45]. Essentially, these
latter two estimation approaches both incorporate the
hypothesis that time use and BMI are simultaneously
determined.
Key to identifying the preferred model is undertaking
tests for endogeneity and then, if endogeneity is con-
firmed, identifying "instruments" that are correlated to
time use but unrelated to the error term in the BMI
equation [45]. We test for endogeneity by estimating the
Durbin-Wu-Hausman F-statistic [46]. Strength of the
instruments is assessed by calculating a variation on the
squared partial correlation between the instruments
excluded from the second stage and the endogenous
regressors [47]. Independence of the instruments from
the error term in the BMI equation is assessed by calcu-
lating Hansen's J statistic [46].
The instrumental variables used to identify the system
in our application are self-identification as the primary
meal preparer, self-identification as the primary grocery
shopper, whether the diary day was a weekend, whether
the diary day was in the summer, whether the diary day
came from 2007, the grocery price index, the hourly
opportunity cost of time, and the household's annual
nonwage income. The instrumental variables approach
involves first estimating the time use equations and using
the coefficients from these equations to generate pre-
dicted time use values for all respondents in the sample.
These predicted values are then included as regressors in
the BMI equations. If all of the necessary conditions are
met, the estimated coefficients using this approach are
purged of possible reverse causation. This approach has
the added advantage of also addressing the typical time
use measurement issue since the predicted values may be
thought of as approximating usual time spent in the var-
ious activities.
Separate equations are estimated for women and men
to allow for the possibility that there are biological factors
related to gender that interact with time use and are
associated with BMI. All analyses are weighted using the
appropriate ATUS weights. The ATUS weights compen-
sate for the survey's oversampling of certain demographic
groups, the oversampling of weekend day diaries, and

differential response rates across demographic groups
[48]. Estimation is done using Stata 11.0 and SAS 9.2.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Descriptive statistics for our samples of men and women
appear in Table 1. The typical male in our sample is
about 44 years old, married, and has one minor child in
the home. He is often the primary grocery shopper
(most often when he is not married), but not the pri-
mary meal preparer in his household. He has some col-
lege education and is currently employed. His hourly
opportunity cost of time is almost $21/hr and he lives
in a household that has approximately $1,669 in nonw-
age income per year. The typical female respondent in
our sample is very similar. She is also 44 years old, mar-
ried, and has one minor child in the home. She is most
often both the primary grocery shopper and the primary
meal preparer. She has some college education and lives
in a household that has approximately $1,604 in nonw-
age income per year. The hourly opportunity cost of her
time is lower at $16.84/hr, about 80% of her male coun-
terpart's, and she is also employed outside of the home.
Table 1 also reveals that the typical man and woman
in our sample are overweight (defined by a BMI that is
greater than 25.0 and less than 30.0). Indeed, fully 75
percent of the males in our sample are overweight or
obese while the corresponding figure for the females is
lower at 57 percent. As a point of comparison, analysis
of clinical data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) show that in 2003-06,
72.6 percent of males age 20-74 and 61.2 percent of
females age 20-74 were overweight or obese [1]. While
the years and our sample age ranges are not entirely
comparable to those in the NHANES study (i.e., our
sample age restriction is 25-64), the figures nonetheless
suggest that, on average, the self-reported height and
weight in the ATUS do a reasonable job of classifying
adults' BMIs. In a more extensive comparison of ATUS
BMI measures to NHANES BMI measures, Hamermesh
[23] reaches the same conclusion for men but notes a
modest downward bias in BMI reporting for women in
the ATUS relative to NHANES.
The descriptive information on the time-use measures
appears in Table 2. It shows that women and men, respec-
tively, spend an average of a little more than an hour a day
in eating where that is the main focus of their attention.
They also spend more than 20 minutes per day on average
engaged in eating as a secondary activity.i Secondary time
spent drinking is much higher with the average time being
57 minutes for men and almost 69 minutes for women.
Time spent in food preparation and clean-up is substan-
tially greater for women than men (about 2.6 times more).
Physically active time averages about 68 minutes a day for
men and 35 minutes a day for women. Sleep time averages
a little more than 8 hours for both men and women.
Finally, the typical woman and man both spend consider-
able time watching television/videos, with men averaging
2.67 hours per day and women averaging 2.13 hours per
viewing television/videos.
Also presented in Table 2 are the fractions of respon-
dents who spend any time in each of the seven activities
on the diary day. Note that virtually all respondents
report that they spend some time engaged in eating as a
primary activity and sleep. However, for most other activ-
ities, there are substantial numbers who report no time
being spent in a particular time-use category. The cen-
sored distribution of time use leads us to use a tobit rou-
tine to estimate the first stage in our instrumental
variables analyses.
Multivariate Results
Table 3 shows the parameter estimates for all three mod-
els for both women and men. The ordinary least squares
(OLS) model suggests that all seven time use categories
are linked to BMI while the instrumental variables model
indicates that only a subset of the time use categories
relate to BMI. Which model is to be preferred? The
answer to that question hinges on three things: (1) an
evaluation of whether endogeneity exists, (2) the strength
of the instruments used to address any observed endo-
geneity, and (3) the independence of the instruments
from the error process.
To test for endogeneity, we first estimate the reduced
form equations for time use. The residuals from these
equations are then included as additional regressors in the
structural equations. The Durbin-Wu-Hausman F-statistic
assesses if the residuals are statistically significant which
would imply that time use and BMI are endogenous [46].
Our set of seven time use categories have an associated
F-statistic of 4.92 (p < .01) for males and 5.01 (p < .01) for
females. Thus, we are confident that endogeneity exists.
Shea's partial R2 statistic can be used to assess the
strength of a set of instruments adjusting for their inter-
correlations when estimating an OLS regression. How-
ever, in our case the censored nature of the dependent
variables leads us to estimate the time use equations
using tobit rather than OLS. Consequently, we assess
instrument strength by estimating the c2 associated with
the instruments excluded from the second stage estima-
tion and each endogenous regressor. This approach is
parallel to an OLS approach suggested by Bound, Jaeger,
and Baker [47]. The calculated c2 for males ranges from
a low of 72 in the case of secondary eating time to a
high of 722 for television/video viewing time. For
females, the range is 136 (secondary drinking time) to
496 (sleep time). All are far above the critical c2 of
21.67, suggesting that our instruments are strong.

Independence of the instruments is assessed by Han-
sen's J statistic which has a c2 distribution with degrees
of freedom equal to the number of over-identifying
restrictions [46]. A statistically significant value suggests
that the instruments used in the first stage are not inde-
pendent of the second stage error term. In our model,
Hansen's J is 3.03 (p = .22) for women and 2.33 (p = .31)
for men, indicating the instruments are not associated
with the error term in either instance.
Taken altogether, the above statistical tests indicate
that there is endogeneity between time use and BMI
and that the instruments used in our estimation meet
the criteria necessary to rely on the instrumental vari-
ables approach. Thus, we highlight the results for the
second stage instrumental variables model along with
the alternative reduced form estimates. Parameter esti-
mates of the first stage estimation appear in Appendix
Tables 4 and 5 for the reader's reference.
It is important to note that the time use coefficients
estimated in the instrumental variables formulation are
always larger than their counterpart estimates in the
OLS model. This is not surprising as past research has
demonstrated that "small window" measurements of the
type provided in a 24-hour time diary are likely biased
toward zero in multivariate analyses [42]. In this con-
text, the instrumental variables approach is also pre-
ferred as it provides estimates of the relationship
between typical time use, rather than a single day's
report of time use, and BMI.
For both females and males, an increase in either pri-
mary or secondary eating time is associated with a sig-
nificantly lower BMI while an increase in secondary
drinking time translates into a significant increase in
BMI. Increases in television/video time are also
associated with a statistically significant increase in BMI
for both men and women. An increase in sleep time is
linked to a significant decline in BMI for men but not
women while more time spent in food preparation is
associated with a decline in BMI for women but not
men. Although time spent being physically active had a
significant negative relationship to BMI in the OLS
model, this relationship is not present for either women
or men in the instrumental variables estimates. We
attribute this null finding to the "small window" pro-
blem associated with a single 24-hour time diary as phy-
sical activity, particularly exercise and sports, may not
occur on a daily basis. With the exception of secondary
eating time, the signs of all the statistically significant
coefficients are in keeping with our hypotheses.
The instrumental variables specification reveals several
differences in socio-demographic variables by gender.
Age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, and
employment effects all vary by gender. For example, an
increase in age is associated with a statistically signifi-
cant increase in BMI for women but not men. Conver-
sely, married/cohabitating males have significantly
higher BMI's than single males, while marriage/cohabi-
tation has no effect on BMI for women, ceteris paribus.
One of the few socio-demographic variables that do not
vary by gender is health status. Being in fair/poor health
is associated with a large increase in BMI for both
women and men.
The reduced form estimates also demonstrate consid-
erable socio-demographic differences by gender. But,
they reveal striking similarities with regard to the eco-
nomic variables. For both women and men, increases in
grocery prices, opportunity costs of time, and nonwage
income are all associated with significantly lower BMI.

Discussion
Our analyses reveal consistent evidence that primary
eating time is inversely related to BMI. Other time diary
research has found that Americans' time spent in pri-
mary eating activities has declined by an average of 11
minutes per day for women and 23 minutes per day for
men between 1975 and 2006 [49]. Taken together with
the findings of this earlier study, the current research
suggests that the rise in BMI over the past 30+ years
may be associated, in part, with changes in Americans'

time spent in primary eating activities. Specifically,
based on our instrumental variables model, we estimate
that an 11-minute decline per day in women's primary
eating time may have translated into a .73 increase in
BMI for women. Likewise, a 23 minute per day decline
in primary eating time over this historical period would
translate into 1.70 increase in BMI for men.
While time spent in primary eating activities has
declined, trend analyses of time diary data show that sec-
ondary eating and drinking time has risen from an average
of 20 minutes per day for women in 1975 to 80 minutes
per day in 2006-07. Similarly, men's secondary eating and
drinking time has risen from an average of 25 minutes per
day to 70 minutes per day over that same historical period
[49]. Surprisingly, in the instrumental variables model,
secondary eating time is associated with a significantly
lower BMI for both men (p < .05) and women (p < .10).
But, secondary drinking time is associated with higher
men's and women's BMIs (p < .10). Our descriptive statis-
tics reveal that secondary drinking time makes up approxi-
mately three-quarters of all time spent in secondary eating
and drinking activities. Past studies have found a positive
relationship between secondary eating and drinking time
and BMI for women [18,19] while others [25] find little
evidence of secondary eating/drinking effects on BMI.
Ours is the first to parse out secondary eating and drink-
ing time. As such, it sheds some light on the mixed find-
ings in the literature, pointing the finger to increases in
secondary drinking time (rather than secondary eating
time) as a possible contributing factor to rising BMIs.
The social-psychological literature would suggest that
less monitoring of caloric intake should occur when eat-
ing and drinking occur a secondary activities and thus
time spent in these activities should be associated with
higher BMI [20-23]. We find this is true with respect to
secondary drinking but not secondary eating. We do not
have a ready explanation for the inverse relationship
between secondary eating time and BMI. Given the lim-
ited and very mixed evidence regarding any possible
linkage between time spent in secondary eating activities
and BMI, further research on this point is sorely needed.
Findings regarding the role that food preparation time
plays in BMI are intriguing. For women, the more time
spent in food preparation and clean-up, the lower their
BMIs. Presumably, more time spent in food preparation
and clean-up is associated with using more primary foods
and fewer prepared foods when cooking. It may also be
associated with smaller serving sizes relative to those
found in prepared meals. Since 83 percent of women but
only 39 percent of the men identify themselves as the pri-
mary meal preparer in their households, it is not surpris-
ing that we do not observe the same relationship for the
men. It would be interesting to investigate whether more
time spent preparing meals by women translate into lower
BMIs for other members of their households as well.
Unfortunately, this question cannot be addressed with the
ATUS data as only one member of each household in the
sample provides time diary and BMI information.
Taken together, our findings regarding primary eating
time, secondary drinking time, and time spent in food
preparation and clean-up (by women) reinforce nutri-
tional educators' emphasis on preparing meals and set-
ting aside time where eating is one's primary focus. The
role of secondary eating in healthy eating behaviours
remains an open question, however.
While we did not find support for a link between physi-
cal activity and BMI, we found strong support for a link
between physical inactivity - as measured by television/
video viewing time - and BMI. This finding is consistent
with past research [8-10] and with public health programs
that encourage individuals to spend less time watching tel-
evision/videos and more time being physically active [50].
While our 24-hour diary may be too short to capture
typical time spent being physically active each day, this is
not true for television/video viewing time which is suffi-
ciently prevalent to be adequately measured with a single,
24-hour diary. Indeed, it may be that television/viewing
time is a more general marker for a sedentary lifestyle
that could be used in place of the more infrequent physi-
cal activity time when analyzing 24-hour time diary data.
Our reduced form model estimates provide some
insights regarding the role that changing prices, oppor-
tunity costs, and nonwage income may be playing in the
rising overweight/obesity epidemic. Clearly, these eco-
nomic factors matter. In the case of opportunity costs,
we show that an increase in the hourly opportunity cost
of time is associated with a significantly lower BMI for
both women and men. It suggests that the recent eco-
nomic recession, which precipitated a decline in work-
ers' opportunity costs, may lead to more weight gain for
Americans. And, this may be especially true for newly
unemployed individuals who are drawing down on their
savings that historically was a source of interest (i.e.,
nonwage) income. Indeed, it would appear that rising
wage rates are not just good for the economy. They may
also be good for Americans' weight management.
Finally, grocery prices are inversely related to BMI for
both males and females. This is consistent with past
research that has linked the historical drop in prices for
energy-rich, processed foods to rising BMI in the United
States [51,52]. It also suggests a dilemma for policy
makers. Lower food prices may increase food access, but
at the same time they may also be serving to fuel greater
caloric intake.
Our study results must be tempered with a couple of
caveats. First, our proxies for biological differences in
BMI are often statistically significant and there are clear
sex-specific interactions with time use that merit further

exploration. Although sample size limitations prevent us
from exploring age and race/ethnicity time-use interac-
tions, such research could provide valuable insights
about the correlates of healthy body weight.
Second, our analysis presents a cautionary tale regarding
the use of "small window" measures of physical activity
time as it relates to BMI. Only about one-third of the
women and two-fifths of the men in our ATUS sample
report doing any 10-minute spells of physical activity that
generate 3.3 METs or more during the 24-hour time per-
iod (See Table 2). Recall that we do not find evidence of
an inverse relationship between time spent in physical
activity and BMI. This is counter to a number of past stu-
dies [4-6,15] but not surprising given that our estimates of
physical activity time are likely biased toward zero. The
Centers for Disease Control recommends that adults age
18-64 spend 150 minutes per week engaged in moderate
intensity aerobic activity, or that they spend 75 minutes
per week in vigorous aerobic activity [40]. Thus, even
those who do follow these recommendations might not
have been exercising on the randomly chosen diary day.
Although it would be costly, future time-diary data gather-
ing efforts should consider expanding the number of time
diaries gathered for each respondent and/or asking addi-
tional questions about the usual time the respondent
spends each week in certain infrequent, but potentially
important activities.
Conclusions
In this large, nationally representative data set, our ana-
lyses reveal that time use and BMI are endogenous. Cross-
sectional analyses that do not adjust for endogeneity will
likely misstate the true relationship between time use and
BMI. Based on our instrumental variables and reduced
form estimates, we conclude that Americans' time use
decisions have important implications for their BMIs. The
analyses suggest that both eating and beverage drinking
time and context matters. In the case of women only, time
spent in food preparation is inversely related to BMI while
for men only, time spent sleeping is inversely related to
BMI. For both men and women, sedentary time, as mea-
sured by television/video viewing time also matters. In
addition, the reduced form models suggest that shifts in
grocery prices, opportunity costs, and non-wage income
may be contributing to alterations in time use patterns
and food choices that have implications for BMI. These
insights should help scholars and practitioners working in
the area of weight management to better target interven-
tion efforts.

viduals whose weights are greater than what health offi-
cials deem to be healthy for a given height.
b There are some indications that this upward trend
may be tapering off as a recent analysis of obesity trends
from 1999 to 2008 found no evidence of increases dur-
ing this most recent 10-year period [2].
c Bertrand and Schanzenbach [19] do not include a
table that shows their multivariate analyses of how sec-
ondary eating time relates to BMI. Thus, we cannot
ascertain if they control for physical activity or sedentary
behaviors in their analyses.
d This variable includes both primary time spent eat-
ing/drinking alone and with others as preliminary inves-
tigation revealed no difference in the coefficient
estimates when these time use categories were sepa-
rated, and thus, we collapse them.
e These latter two activities are identified as generating
3.01 and 3.26 METs respectively.
f Independent variables included in the wage estima-
tion are age, age-squared, education, northeast, north-
central, and southern regions, and rural residence. The
inclusion of the random error term in the predicted
values reduces the potential for multicollinearity in the
subsequent analyses and collinearity diagnostics con-
firmed that there were no collinearity issues. The esti-
mating equations are available from the authors upon
request.
g Independent variables included in the nonwage
income estimation are age, age-squared, education,
number of children less than age 18, African American,
single female headed household, single male headed
household, and southern region of residence. The inclu-
sion of the random error term in the predicted values
reduces the potential for multicollinearity in the subse-
quent analyses and collinearity diagnostics confirmed
that there were no collinearity issues. The estimating
equations are available from the authors upon request.
h C2ER's cost of living index was formally called the
American Chamber of Commerce Research Associa-
tion's Cost of Living Index. Indeed, it is still listed as
ACCRA's Cost of Living Index on the C2ER web page.
There are 35 items in the ACCRA grocery price index.
All but 5 of these items are foods or drinks. The 5 non-
food items are boys' jeans, Lipitor, veterinary services,
laundry detergent, and facial tissues. Our ACCRA data
set did not contain sufficient detail to delete these five
items from our overall grocery price index measure.
Thus, our grocery price variable contains some measure-
ment error. Metro areas in this data set consist of urba-
nized areas with 50,000 or more residents. Micro areas
are communities with at least 10,000 but less than
50,000 in population.
i Paid work, watching television, and socializing and
communicating with others were the most common pri-
mary activities that were done while eating was a sec-
ondary activity.
