Background
Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for the development and progression of
cardiovascular disease. While smoking is associated with increased levels of inflammatory
markers and accelerated atherosclerosis, few studies have examined the impact of smoking
cessation on levels of inflammatory markers. The degree and rate at which inflammation
subsides after smoking cessation are uncertain. It also remains unclear as to whether traditional
risk factors can adequately explain the observed decline in cardiovascular risk following
smoking cessation.
Methods and Findings
Using data from 15,489 individuals who participated in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), we analyzed the association between smoking and
smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers and traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
In particular, we examined changes in C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, albumin, and
fibrinogen. Inflammatory markers demonstrated a dose-dependent and temporal relationship
to smoking and smoking cessation. Both inflammatory and traditional risk factors improved
with decreased intensity of smoking. With increased time since smoking cessation,
inflammatory markers resolved more slowly than traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
Conclusion
Inflammatory markers may be more accurate indicators of atherosclerotic disease.
Inflammatory markers returned to baseline levels 5 y after smoking cessation, consistent with
the time frame associated with cardiovascular risk reduction observed in both the MONICA and
Northwick Park Heart studies. Our results suggest that the inflammatory component of
cardiovascular disease resulting from smoking is reversible with reduced tobacco exposure and
smoking cessation.

Introduction
In addition to the role of smoking in cancer initiation and
promotion, cigarette smoking accelerates atherogenic cardi-
ovascular disease in both a dose- and a duration-dependent
manner through several concurrent pathways. Smoking
incites an immunologic response to vascular injury, described
as oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation, endothelial
cell dysfunction, and foam cell proliferation in the tunica
media [1,2]. Smoking also enhances platelet aggregation,
impairs lipoprotein metabolism, depresses high-density lip-
oprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and reduces distensibility of
vessel walls [3,4].
Cigarette smoking is associated with increased levels of
inflammatory markers. During the acute phase of inflamma-
tory states, there are quantifiable increases in C-reactive
protein, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen, and decreases
in serum albumin [5­8]. Acute inflammatory markers have
been shown to be both prognostic and predictive of future
cardiovascular events in several populations. For example, C-
reactive protein has been discussed extensively as a marker of
cardiovascular disease risk [9­16].
C-reactive protein in particular is also increasingly being
implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis [17­19]. C-
reactive protein is a pentaxin, highly conserved across species
[17,20,21] and stimulated synergistically by both IL-6 and IL-
1b [22­25]. Previously believed to be synthesized by the liver,
recent evidence suggests that C-reactive protein is also
produced at the site of atherosclerosis by smooth muscle
cells [17]. In the vessel wall, it induces expression of adhesion
molecules on endothelial cells and increases monocyte
chemotactic protein-1, which attracts monocytes and T cells
into the vessel wall [26­28]. Additionally, C-reactive protein
reduces endothelial nitric oxide synthase, upregulates the
proatherosclerotic NF-jB pathway, enhances low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) uptake by macrophages, which become
foam cells, and facilitates T-cell- and complement-mediated
destruction and apoptosis of the endothelium [2,26,29­31].
Thus, C-reactive protein is increasingly described not only as
a marker of the inflammatory response, but also as a mediator
in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
[2,27]. Other inflammatory markers may also have causal
properties, but are not as well understood. The inflammatory
response therefore not only indicates atherosclerotic poten-
tial, but may accelerate atherosclerosis.
Several studies have described a prevalent inflammatory
state in smokers. Despite the known impact of smoking on
cardiovascular disease progression, few studies have exam-
ined the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflamma-
tory markers or on cardiovascular risk reduction [6,32]. The
level to which the inflammatory response subsides following
smoking cessation and the rate at which the inflammatory
response subsides are uncertain. Furthermore, it remains
unclear whether traditional risk factors can adequately
explain the decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking
cessation.
Using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III), a population-based representative
sample of United States adults, we investigated the associa-
tion between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of
inflammatory markers and traditional cardiovascular risk
factors. We examined the association between changes in the
inflammatory markers--C-reactive protein, white blood cell
count, albumin, and fibrinogen--and the traditional risk
factors--total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,
systolic blood pressure, and diabetes--with decreased smok-
ing intensity and increased time since smoking cessation. Our
primary objective was to investigate changes in C-reactive
protein in an effort to characterize the excess cardiovascular
risk associated with smoking and any associated decline in
risk with smoking cessation. We also aimed to characterize
whether the inflammatory markers or traditional risk factors
explained observed cardiac risk reduction following smoking
cessation.
Methods
Study Population
The NHANES III survey and data collection procedures
have been described in detail elsewhere [33,34]. Briefly,
NHANES III was a national probability survey conducted
between 1988 and 1994. This survey used a complex, multi-
stage, stratified cluster sampling design to obtain a repre-
sentative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian United
States population. Participation included a home examina-
tion and a visit to a mobile examination center in one of 89
locations. For those unable to travel to a mobile examination
center, a special home visit was arranged.
Of the 19,618 persons aged 18 and over included in the
NHANES III population, we excluded 3,021 persons for
whom C-reactive protein levels were missing, given that this
was our primary marker of interest. Another 292 persons
were excluded because they were pregnant, and 816 people
were excluded because they reported cigar, pipe, snuff, or
chewing tobacco use. Data for 15,489 persons were analyzed.
Measures
Self-reported race/ethnicity was categorized as non-His-
panic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican-American, or
other. The self-reported poverty to income ratio, a marker
of socioeconomic status used in multiple prior studies [35,36],
was classified as ,1.5, 1.5­3, or .3.
Self-reported clinical factors were dichotomized for anal-
ysis. Participants reported on use of non-steroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs, estrogen replacement therapy, and
vitamin supplements. Use of any alcohol in the past 24 h
was measured by dietary recall questionnaire. Prior physi-
cian-diagnosed angina, myocardial infarction, or stroke was
defined as prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease
(ASCVD). Prevalent inflammatory disease was defined as the
presence of rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, emphysema, or
chronic bronchitis. Presence of acute illness was indicated by
a positive answer to the question: ``In the past few days have
you had a cough, cold, or other acute illness?''
Additional clinical factors were measured by a combina-
tion of participant self-report and clinical exam and were
also dichotomized for analysis. Hypertension was indicated by
use of anti-hypertensive medication, an average systolic blood
pressure over 140 mm Hg, or an average diastolic blood
pressure over 90 mm Hg, over four readings. Diabetes
mellitus was considered present if the participant reported
physician diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (excluding diagnosis
during pregnancy), was taking diabetes medications, had
fasting plasma glucose over 7 mmol/l (126 mg/dl), or had non-

fasting glucose levels over 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). Finally,
serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured
enzymatically (Hitachi 704 analyzer, Boehringer Mannheim,
Mannheim, Germany). LDL was calculated using the Friede-
wald equation and measured fasting triglycerides, total
cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol. LDL cholesterol and
triglycerides were included as continuous variables and were
logarithmically transformed to approximate the normal
curve.
Smoking history was categorized based on both self-report
and serum cotinine levels. Persons who gave a history of
current smoking and/or had serum cotinine levels greater
than 56.8 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) were considered current smokers.
Current smokers were categorized into four roughly equal
groups, based on number of cigarettes per day: 1­9, 10­19,
20­29, and over 30 cigarettes per day. Former smokers were
defined by self-report as having smoked over 100 cigarettes in
their lifetime and as having quit smoking. Former smokers
were categorized by years since smoking cessation. Since the
zero year since cessation point is subject to misclassification
bias, the following levels were used in analyses: ,1, 1­3, 3­5,
5­7, 7­9, and .9 ysince cessation. Never smokers were
defined by self-report and as having serum cotinine levels
under 56.8 nmol/l (,10 ng/ml). Passive smokers with cotinine
levels over 56.8 nmol/l (10 ng/ml) were categorized as smokers
at the lowest dose-intensity level.
Our main outcome variable, C-reactive protein, was
measured using a latex-enhanced Behring Nephelometer
Analyzer System (Dade Behring, Deerfield, Illinois, United
States). Because the presence or absence, rather than the
absolute level, of C-reactive protein appears to be associated
with cardiovascular risk, we compared undetectable versus
detectable levels of this marker. This is consistent with
previous research, given the nonlinearity of C-reactive
protein interpretation [37,38]. Since the limit of detection
for the latex-enhanced nephelometry assay was 2.1 mg/l, we
defined undetectable as less than 2.1 mg/l. Other outcome
variables were treated continuously. White blood cell count
was determined using a fully automated Coulter S-PLUS JR
hematology analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, California,
United States). Albumin was measured using the bromocresol
purple method. Fibrinogen was measured using a quantita-
tive assay of clotting time compared to a known standard.
Statistical Methods
The distributions of traditional risk factors, inflammatory
markers, and clinical and sociodemographic factors were
examined by smoking status. Chi-square and analysis of
variance tests, as appropriate, were performed to test for
statistically significant differences. Variables identified as
potential confounders by these bivariate analyses were
included in multivariate models, as were the cofactors
believed to be clinically relevant.
For multivariate analyses, our primary independent vari-
ables were smoking intensity and time since smoking
cessation. Our primary dependent variables were the inflam-
matory markers--C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, white blood
cell count, and serum albumin--and the traditional risk
factors--systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, HDL, LDL, diabetes, and alcohol use. Two sets of
multivariate models were developed. The first set of analyses
(minimally adjusted) were adjusted for age, sex, and race,
given previously reported differences in the distribution of
inflammatory markers in those groups. The second set of
analyses (fully adjusted) were adjusted for all covariates and
potential confounders: age, sex, race, poverty to income ratio,
body mass index, prevalent cardiovascular disease, prevalent
diabetes, prevalent chronic inflammatory condition, current
acute illness, and use of alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflam-
matory medication, aspirin, and estrogen replacement.
For inflammatory markers and traditional risk factors that
were measured continuously, linear regressions were used to
model the relationship to smoking intensity and time since
smoking cessation. Least square means were calculated. C-
reactive protein (a dichotomous variable) was modeled with
logistic regression, using never smokers as the reference
category. Odds ratios, however, do not approximate risk
ratios, given that the prevalence of elevated C-reactive
protein is over 10%.
The dose­response relationship between both smoking
intensity and time since smoking cessation and each of the
outcomes was assessed using Mantel tests for trend. Three sets
of tests were performed, evaluating the trends: (1) among
current smokers by cigarettes per day; (2) among former
smokers by time since cessation; and (3) among smokers,
former smokers, and non-smokers, despite the potential
nonlinearity between groups. To further explain the relation-
ship between smoking exposure and C-reactive protein, to
increase the power to detect a trend, and to reduce residual
confounding, C-reactive protein was categorized into three
levels: under 2.1 mg/l (undetectable), 2.1­9.9 mg/l (mildly
elevated), and 10.0 mg/l (clinically significant).
Lastly, blocked group comparisons were done using
adjusted chi-square tests. Inflammatory and traditional risk
factors were compared across current, former, and never
smokers to validate findings from previous studies.
All analyses were weighted to represent the total civilian,
non-institutionalized United States population; they are,
therefore, population prevalence estimates. Analyses were
conducted in SAS (version 8.02; SAS Institute, Cary, North
Carolina, United States) and SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North, Carolina,
United States), incorporating sampling weights to account for
nonresponse and oversampling. All analyses were conducted
using two-sided tests with alpha set to 0.05.
Results
Of the 15,489 persons in our sample, 7,665 were classified
as never smokers, 3,459 were classified as former smokers, and
4,365 were classified as current smokers. The average time
since smoking cessation for former smokers was 13 y. The
average cotinine level for current smokers was 1,255 nmol/l
(221 ng/ml); for both former and never smokers the average
cotinine level was ,3 nmol/l (,0.5 ng/ml). Weighted
descriptive statistics are given in Table 1.
Bivariate analyses of smoking status showed that among the
inflammatory risk factors, unadjusted C-reactive protein,
white blood cell count, and fibrinogen were all significantly
and positively associated with smoking status (p , 0.01).
Albumin levels were similar across smoking categories.
Among traditional risk factors, smokers had higher total
cholesterol and triglycerides, but were otherwise younger,
had lower body mass index, and had lower blood pressure,

and a smaller proportion were diabetic. Former smokers were
most likely to have prevalent atherosclerotic cardiovascular
disease.
Bivariate analyses of the inflammatory markers showed that
C-reactive protein was significantly associated with older age
(p-trend , 0.01 by 10-y age group), female sex (p , 0.01), and
black race (p , 0.01). Serum albumin and serum fibrinogen
showed similarly significant associations. White cell count was
associated with race (p , 0.01), but not with age or sex.
Among traditional risk factors, analyses showed that total
cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
and systolic blood pressure were each associated with age, sex,
and race (all p , 0.01). Diabetes was associated with age and
race only (p , 0.01). Alcohol use was associated with age and
sex only (p , 0.01). All models, therefore, were adjusted for
age, race, and sex.
Table 2 displays abatement of the inflammatory response
with (1) reduced intensity of smoking and (2) increased time
since smoking cessation, adjusted for age, sex, and race. C-
reactive protein, white blood cell count, and fibrinogen were
all positively associated with increased smoking intensity (p 
0.01) and were all significantly negatively associated with time
since smoking cessation (p , 0.05). Similarly, albumin showed
a negative association with intensity of smoking (p  0.01),
but no relationship after cessation. All acute phase reactant
inflammatory markers had significant trends overall, from
current to former to never smokers (p  0.01) (Figure 1).
Differences in the traditional cardiovascular risk factors
are shown in Table 3, adjusted for age, sex, and race. Total
and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, alcohol usage, and systolic
blood pressure all showed a dose-dependent association with
smoking intensity (p , 0.05). Triglycerides and alcohol use
showed time-dependent associations with smoking cessation
(p  0.01). Overall trends (from current to former to never
smokers) were present for alcohol use, triglycerides, total
cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol, as shown in Figure 2. In
models fully adjusted for all covariates (not shown), dose-
dependent associations persisted for HDL cholesterol and
triglycerides (p  0.01). Both total cholesterol and triglycer-
ides showed an association with time since smoking cessation
(p = 0.03 for both) and an overall trend from current to never
smokers in fully adjusted models.
Lastly, the inflammatory markers were examined in fully
adjusted models. C-reactive protein continued to show
abatement of the acute phase response with reduced smoking
intensity and increased time since cessation despite adjust-
ment for covariates (Table 4). White blood cell count and
albumin were associated with smoking intensity but not with
time since cessation. All positive acute phase reactants
showed an associated decline from current to former to
never smokers in fully adjusted models (p  0.01); albumin,
likewise showed a significant increase (p-trend  0.01).
Analyses using pack-years were also done (not shown); the
results were unchanged using this measure. Additionally, data
were reanalyzed excluding those individuals with prevalent
cardiovascular disease (not shown); results were again
unchanged and measures of association were even slightly
stronger. Overall, we observed the following associations: (1)
improvement in both inflammatory markers and traditional
risk factors with decreased intensity of smoking, and (2)

Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
improvement in inflammatory markers with increased time
since smoking cessation.
Discussion
In this cross-sectional population-based study, we were able
to demonstrate dose effects from smoking and temporal
effects from cigarette smoking cessation. The NHANES III
dataset allowed us to utilize both self-reported smoking and
serum cotinine levels to minimize misclassification error. It
also allowed us to control for a wide range of confounders
and assess consistency across measures by analyzing four
acute phase proteins and several traditional risk factors. By
examining both traditional risk factors and inflammatory
markers of cardiovascular risk, this study contributes to the
literature by providing a more complete analysis with regard
to the effects of smoking and smoking cessation.
It is known that after smokers give up smoking, their risk of
mortality and future cardiac events declines [32,39], but there
is little data quantifying the rate of risk reduction and when,
or even whether, cardiovascular risk for former smokers
reaches that of never smokers [12,40,41]. We found that the
smoking-associated inflammatory response subsides within 5
y after smoking cessation. This suggests that the vascular
effects are reversible and that cardiovascular risk subsides
gradually with reduced exposure. The time to risk factor
``correction'' was longest with C-reactive protein; only one
traditional risk factor--triglycerides--showed a similar pat-
tern. Our findings are consistent with prior studies, suggest-
ing that the full benefit of smoking cessation may be achieved
gradually [39,42,43].

Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
Our estimates of the time to risk factor ``correction'' are
shorter than those for the decline in mortality risk and risk
for specific cardiac events reported in some prospective
studies [42,44], but on par with those in other prospective
[45], case-control [46,47], and cross-sectional [48] studies.
Discrepancies may be due to smoking recidivism in prospec-
tive studies, where former smokers recommence smoking and
increase their risk, such that the reported time since cessation
is longer than the true time, or due to a lag between changes
in cardiovascular risk factors and regression of disease.

Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
Additionally, one would expect morbidity risk to subside first,
since mortality is a more distant endpoint. Prior studies also
did not control for known cardiovascular risk factors, did not
use serum cotinine levels, did not examine the associated
change in inflammatory markers post-cessation, or grouped
participants into broad categories of current, former, and
never smokers, increasing residual confounding while failing
to explore the relative effects within each group [9,12,49].
Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether C-reactive protein's
ongoing decline in former smokers simply indicates a
prevalent underlying burden of atherosclerotic plaque, or
``simmering'' ongoing disease processes. The direct associa-
tions of C-reactive protein with mortality decrement seen in
these other studies--and the dose­response seen in our own
study--suggest the latter.
Three studies have systematically examined inflammatory
markers following smoking: the MONICA Study (Monitoring
Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease) [46], the
Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) [48], and the Northwick
Park Heart Study [45]. The Cardiovascular Health Study
found no association between inflammatory markers and
smoking status itself, although C-reactive protein was strongly
related to lifetime smoking exposure as measured by pack-
years. Our results, while based on more complete modeling,
support findings from the Northwick Park Heart Study and
MONICA Study, both of which found that fibrinogen levels
(adjusted only for age) reached normal levels within 5 y.
Our study supports the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk
falls with inflammatory abatement, and that inflammatory
markers are better indicators of such risk reduction. In this
analysis, triglycerides showed the strongest dose-intensity and
temporal trends of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
This is both consistent with prior research and not surprising
since the strongest association between C-reactive protein
and lipid measures is for triglycerides. Despite the colinearity,
the inflammatory markers studied appear to have a much
clearer trend and longer lasting effect after smoking cessation
than traditional risk factors. This would suggest their greater
utility in being more accurate markers of disease, particularly
given C-reactive protein's increasingly apparent role in the
pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Alternative explanations
include (1) the presence of multiple independent causal
pathways leading to cardiovascular disease and (2) traditional
risk factors correlating more closely with mortality than
morbidity or underlying pathophysiology. The relative value
of novel inflammatory markers versus traditional risk factors
remains of much debate [50,51].
Limitations of this study include measurement error from
self-reporting, residual confounding from use of indicator
variables, smoking recidivism, lack of newer measures such as
interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [52], and
lack of data on secondhand smoke. Recent studies have
suggested that toxin exposures from secondhand smoke may
impact the biomarkers used in this study [53,54]. We
attempted to adjust for bias in self-reporting and secondhand
exposure by using serum cotinine levels, but residual
confounding may exist. It has also been suggested that
circulating C-reactive protein levels may not reflect all
relevant inflammatory effectors, owing to post-transcrip-
tional regulation of C-reactive protein [22]. We chose C-
reactive protein, however, for its clear role in the inflamma-
tory response and for its increasing clinical relevance. Lastly,
it is noteworthy that we are not using a linear scale, but
measures of both intensity and duration. Time since cessation
and cigarettes per day are distinctly different measures, and a
discontinuity arises at cessation.
Further research should explore the acute phase response
in the months following smoking cessation [53,55­57]. Time
intervals of less than a year since cessation have not been
assessed adequately in other studies nor in this study because
of sample size limitations of the NHANES III data. Addition-
ally, if cardiovascular risk subsides gradually upon smoking
cessation, do vessel wall damage and pro-aggregatory
cascades all completely reverse course upon cessation? Future
research should continue to explore the relationship between
the inflammatory cascade and alterations in the vessel wall
[7,58].
This and other similar studies suggest that smoking
cessation should play a larger role in public policy. Linked
to poverty, decreased productivity, and premature death,
tobacco remains the second major cause of preventable death
in the world and fourth most common risk factor for disease
worldwide [59]. While tobacco is clearly a worldwide concern,
states and localities are left responsible for addressing
tobacco use and smoking in a comprehensive manner. Our
results suggest that policy-makers faced with escalating

Smoking and Cardiovascular Disease Risk
health-care costs should look to smoking cessation as an
opportunity to achieve both long- and short-term health-care
cost savings through cardiovascular risk reduction [60]. If
cardiovascular benefits are, in fact, readily attainable, there
exists an opportunity for short-term gain from smoking
cessation. This may be sufficient to induce policy change.
Larger scale action is also needed. Arguments persist in the
developing world regarding the forced opening of tobacco
markets as a result of the Global Agreements on Tariffs and
Trade. Guidance may be forthcoming, however, from the
World Health Organization Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, which began operation in February 2005
as an international treaty aimed at controlling tobacco
packaging, marketing, and use [61]. Over 60 nation-states
are currently parties to the Framework Convention on
Tobacco Control, including many European nations and
Japan, although the United States has yet to approve this
treaty. Opportunities for tobacco control remain available,
and it is becoming increasingly clear that smoking cessation
models deserve high priority both in research and in any
preventive health care system.

Patient Summary
Background Smoking is associated with an increased chance of getting
cardiovascular abnormalities, such as atherosclerosis, which can lead to
heart attacks and other illnesses. One of the ways in which smoking
causes damage is by causing inflammation; this inflammation can be
measured by looking at the levels of various substances (such as C-
reactive protein, white blood cells, albumin, and fibrinogen) in the blood.
Stopping smoking decreases the chances of developing cardiovascular
disease, and this decreased risk may be related to the levels of the
inflammatory markers in the blood.
What Did the Researchers Do? They compared the levels of the
markers of inflammation measured in the blood of around 15,000 people
who had taken part in a National lifestyle study in the United States with
information about whether these people had ever smoked and whether
they smoked currently.
The researchers found that the markers of inflammation were lowest in
those people who had never smoked, and decreased as the time since
stopping smoking increased. It took five years after stopping smoking for
the inflammatory makers to return to normal.
What Do These Findings Mean? Smoking is the second most important
cause of death worldwide, and one of the main ways it causes death is
through cardiovascular disease. This work confirms that the risk of
cardiovascular disease does decrease after stopping smoking, and is
marked by changes in the levels of inflammatory markers. Encouraging
people to give up smoking is very important to reduce the amount of
cardiovascular disease caused by smoking, but the markers of
inflammation, and hence the risk of getting cardiovascular disease,
may take several years to return to normal.
