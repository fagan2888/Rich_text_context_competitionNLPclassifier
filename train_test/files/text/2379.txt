An ACA Provision Increased
Treatment For Young Adults With
Possible Mental Illnesses Relative
To Comparison Group
ABSTRACT The Affordable Care Act (ACA) required that insurers allow
people ages 19­25 to remain as dependents on their parents' health
insurance beginning in 2010. Using data from the 2008­12 National
Survey of Drug Use and Health, we examined the impact of the ACA
dependent coverage provision on people ages 18­25 with possible mental
health or substance use disorders. We found that after implementation of
the ACA provision, among people ages 18­25 with possible mental health
disorders, mental health treatment increased by 5.3 percentage points
relative to a comparison group of similar people ages 26­35. Smaller, but
consistent, effects were found among all young adults, not only those
with possible illnesses. For people using mental health treatment,
uninsured visits declined by 12.4 percentage points, and visits paid by
private insurance increased by 12.9 percentage points. We observed no
changes in mental health treatment setting. Outcomes related to
substance abuse treatment did not change during the study period. The
dependent coverage provision can contribute to a broader strategy for
improving behavioral health treatment for young adults.
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has
been considered a transformative
policy for increasing access to care
for people with mental health and
substance use disorders.1 Although
the largest ACA coverage expansions began in
January 2014, one important early provision
has allowed young adults to remain on their par-
ents' health insurance as dependents. The de-
pendent coverage provision went into effect in
September 2010. It applies to people ages 19­25
whether or not they reside outside of their par-
ents' home, are their parents' tax dependents, or
are married.2
The provision initially did not require insurers
to cover people who already had an offer of
employer-sponsored insurance, but this exemp-
tion was phased out in 2014.2 Early estimates
suggest the provision increased the number of
insured people in the target population by over
two million3­5 and increased the use of emergen-
cy department and hospital services.6,7
The dependent coverage provision could be
especially important for young adults because
mental health and substance use disorders peak
in young adulthood,8 and insurance coverage
has historically been low among young adults.9
At leasttwo studies have examinedtheimpactsof
the ACA provision. Yaa Akosa Antwi and co-
authors6 used data from the National Inpatient
Sample, a national sample of hospital admis-
sions, and found that the provision had both
increased inpatient admissions overall among
young adults and increased the fraction of young
adults admitted with private insurance. The
same study found that mental health admissions
had increased by 5.5 percent, relative to a com-
parison group of older adults, and that mental
health admissions increased more than all non-
pregnancy-related admissions (including non­

In the second study, Paul Fronstin10 used
claims data from a single large employer to com-
pare young adults who were covered as employ-
eesand those whowerenewlycovered asdepend-
ents. He found that people enrolled through the
new provision were higher users of mental
health and substance abuse treatment than peo-
ple in the same age group with coverage in their
own name.
Other recent insurance expansions that were
not specific to young adults provide additional
evidence about the potential impacts of access to
health insurance on mental health and sub-
stance abuse treatment. A natural experiment
in Oregon in which low-income adults were ran-
domly offered the chance to enroll in public in-
surance found that the use of mental health treat-
ment surged among adults who received an
opportunity to enroll and that expanded cover-
age lowered the burden of depression symp-
toms.11 However, on average the Oregon sample
was both poorer and older than the people affect-
ed by the ACA dependent coverage provision.
In contrast, Ellen Meara and coauthors found
no change in hospital-based care for behavioral
health among people ages 19­25 in Massachu-
setts after the state's 2006 health reform.12 How-
ever, the reform increased financial protection
for people with behavioral health diagnoses.
We extend the recent literature by using data
from the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health. This allowed us to estimate the impacts
of the ACA dependent coverage provision on
treatment in a nationally representative popula-
tion of young adults who screened positive for
possible mental health or substance use dis-
orders.
We hypothesized that the provision would in-
crease the use of both mental health and sub-
stance abuse services among people with likely
disorders. In addition to increasing use overall,
we expected that increasing private coverage
rates would also lower out-of-pocket spending
for people already in treatment--an effect that
has been identified in previous insurance expan-
sions and mental health coverage provisions.13,14
The ACA dependent coverage provision could
also change the setting and type of care received
by people needing treatment, especially among
the previously uninsured. Uninsured people typ-
ically rely upon community clinics and other
safety-net providers.15,16 In contrast, it may be
relatively difficult for the uninsured to access
specialist and residential treatment for sub-
stance use disorders and individualized psycho-
therapy for mental disorders.17 Gaining private
coverage could shift people toward specialty ser-
vices and settings.
Study Data And Methods
Data We combined data files from the 2008­12
rounds of the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health, an annual cross-sectional survey of
noninstitutionalized people that is administered
by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-
vice Administration. The survey covers the use
and abuse of drugs and alcohol, mental health
problems, and experiences with mental health or
substance abuse treatment. Survey subjects are
selected through a stratified random sample of
addresses and answer questions using audio
computer-assisted self-interviewing. To provide
nationally representative estimates, we applied
survey weights that adjusted for differential sam-
pling and nonresponse rates.
Ourmain groupof interest waspeopleages 19­
25 who were likely to have either mental health
or substance use disorders. However, because
the survey reports age in categories, we could
not exclude eighteen-year-olds. Therefore, our
analysis group was people ages 18­25. There
were 13,897 people in the mental health sample
and 14,705 in the substance abuse sample (5,585
people met the criteria for and were included in
both groups). Our comparison group was people
ages 26­35 with the same symptoms.
We categorized people as possibly needing
mental health treatment using a measure of se-
rious psychological distress in the previous year.
The measure was based on the Kessler-6 inven-
tory, a six-item scale designed to be used by lay
interviewers that includes questions about
symptoms of depression and anxiety.18 We cate-
gorized people as possibly needing substance
abuse treatment if they met screening criteria
for either dependence on or abuse of alcohol
or drugs (not including tobacco).
Screening measures of substance abuse or de-
pendence in the National Survey of Drug Use and
Health are based on the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition
(DSM-IV). They capture personal, legal, and
school or employment problems related to sub-
stance use as well as problems in reducing use of
the substance. For example, if a respondent in-
dicated that she drank alcohol, she would be
asked questions about alcohol abuse such as,
"During the past twelve months did you have
any problems with family or friends that were
probably caused by your drinking?" She would
also be asked questions about alcohol depen-
dence such as symptoms of anxiety and nausea
after cutting back on alcohol use. The survey
measures of mental health and substance use
disorders have been validated for screening in
community-based samples of adults.18,19
We considered four outcomes separately for
mental health and drug or alcohol treatment:

the use of any treatment in the previous twelve
months; if treatment was received, whether pre-
vious treatment had been paid for by private
insurance (instead of some other source); the
setting or type of previous treatment; and the
coverage of mental health and substance abuse
treatment among people with private insurance.
In a descriptive analysis, we examined differ-
ences in several variables that were likely to pre-
dict use independent of the ACA policy: sex, self-
reported general health, marital status, race or
ethnicity, employment status, receipt of any gov-
ernmentassistance, and residence in a metropol-
itan area.
Statistical Analysis Following other studies
that have looked at the ACA dependent coverage
provision, we used difference-in-differences re-
gression to estimate the impact of the provi-
sion.4,5,20 This method identified the effect of
the policy by comparing how much outcomes
changed during the study period for people
ages 18­25, relative to changes for people
ages 26­35.
We considered people in the older age group as
a counterfactual for trends in access and treat-
ment in the absence of the policy. This is because
the older people were assumed to be unaffected
by the dependent coverage policy but affected by
other time-varying factors, such as changes in
the labor market or in access to substances.
To capture the average impacts of the policy,
we used linear probability models. All models
included indicators for age group and for wheth-
er the person was observed in the post period,
after the implementation of the policy.
Each estimate is the interaction between the
post period and the group of people ages 18­25
from a separate regression. For example, a posi-
tive 0.10 difference-in-differences estimate for
the use of mental health treatment would signify
that changes during the post period in the rate of
mental health treatment for people ages 18­25
was 10 percentage points greater than the
changes among people ages 26­35. In turn, this
suggests that the ACA dependent coverage pro-
vision has had a positive effect on mental health
treatment.
In our preferred specification we excluded
data from 2010, since the provision was imple-
mented in September of that year. However, our
estimates were consistent when we treated 2010
as a year in the pre period. We also included a
linear time trend.21
Our preferred specification included covari-
ates only for race or ethnicity and for residence
in a metropolitan area. In the online Appendix22
we report on regressions that included controls
for self-rated health, employment status, receipt
of social services, income, education, and mari-
tal status.
It is important to note that because differences
were measured relative to the comparison sam-
ple, a positive difference-in-differences finding
could occur either because an increase in the
outcome over the baseline among people
ages 18­25 was larger than the increase among
people ages 26­35 or because there was no
change (or a smaller decline) relative to the base-
line among the younger group during a period of
decline among the older group.
To display differences and difference-in-
differences, we used predictive margins.23 Here
we present model-predicted rates for each age
group (18­25 and 26­35) by time period (the
pre and post periods) after adjustment for cova-
riates.
Models were weighted to be representative of
the US population. Standard errors and confi-
dence intervals accounted for the stratified sam-
pling design.
Limitations Some limitations should be con-
sidered. First, we could not measure changes in
dependent coverage versus changes in other
types of private coverage, since the National Sur-
vey of Drug Use and Health does not determine
whether private coverage is provided directly to
the person or as a dependent on someone else's
plan.
Second, our study design allowed us to control
for time-varying factors that might have affected
coverage and access to care across different age
groups. However, we could not rule out the in-
fluence of other simultaneously occurring fac-
tors that might have had a disproportionate im-
pact on young adults. For example, young adults
were particularly affected by the economic down-
turn that occurred after December 2007.24 None-
theless, our models were robust to controls for
individual employment status.
Third, we could not determine whether or not
some effects were connected to the early impact
of federal mental health parity.
The dependent
coverage provision
shifted mental health
treatment costs for
young adults to
private insurers.

Fourth, for reasons of data confidentiality we
could not examine age as a continuous variable.
Also, because of the age categories in the Nation-
al Survey of Drug Use and Health, we could not
exclude eighteen-year-olds from our treatment
group. This might have caused us to understate
the true effects of the ACA dependent coverage
provision.
Fifth, we could not examine detailed geo-
graphical differences, which might be pertinent
because thirty-seven states had some form of
extended dependent coverage provision before
2010.25 However, most of those provisions were
more restrictive than the one in the ACA that
superseded them, and there is little evidence that
the state provisions increased coverage.26,27
Sixth, because the survey respondents re-
ported on outcomes spanning the previous
twelve months, some of the respondents from
2011 might have reported outcomes for a period
when the extended dependent coverage policy
had not been fully implemented. This would also
tend to understate the impact of the policy.
Seventh, because we focused on subgroups
with possible illness, our study did not account
for effects of the provision among people who
experienced recovery. We did not observe any
population-level changes in the prevalence of
these conditions during the study period. How-
ever, such changes might occur in the long term.
Finally, as is the case with all surveys that mea-
surestigmatized conditions and behaviors, there
is possible nonresponse and social desirability
bias in the results of the National Survey of Drug
Use and Health. The surveyors mitigate these
factors by using audio computer-assisted self-
interviewing and survey instruments that are
designed to reduce social desirability bias.28
Study Results
Sample Statistics Exhibit 1 presents character-
istics of the samples with possible mental health
and substance use disorders during the period
before the provision was implemented (2008­
09).Women made up 62.0 percent of the mental
health sample, compared to 38.5 percent in the
substance use sample. Non-Hispanic whites ac-
counted for about two-thirds of both samples.
The largest segments in both groups were em-
ployed full time, but large fractions were not in
the labor force (including students) or were un-
employed. Just under half of the people in both
groups had completed or spent some time in
college.
About one-quarter of the members of both
groups had incomes below the federal poverty
level. Uninsurance was high in this period before
implementation of the ACA dependent coverage
provision: 28.7 percent of people in the mental
health sample and 29.5 percent in the substance
use sample were uninsured.
Sizable minorities in both groups rated their
health below very good or excellent. In addition,
36.1 percentof thementalhealth samplealso had
possible substance use disorders, and 31.1 per-

cent of the substance use sample also had possi-
ble mental disorders. More than half of the
people in both groups resided in a large metro-
politan area.
Unadjusted Trends From 2008 to 2012 the
use of mental health treatment by people
ages 18­25 with possiblemental healthproblems
steadily increased, from less than 30 percent to
about 33 percent (Exhibit 2). In contrast, for
people ages 26­35 the highest rate (above 47 per-
cent) was in 2009, after which it declined to
about 40 percent in 2011. The use of substance
abuse treatment by people with possible disor-
ders remained relatively flat for both age groups
during the study period.
People ages 18­25 with possible mental health
disorders who used any treatment in the previ-
ous year experienced a slight increase in having
their last treatment paid for by private insurance
from 2008 (about 30 percent in) to 2012 (34 per-
cent) (Exhibit 3). However, the situation varied
much more for people ages 26­35, with the rate
of private insurance payment plummeting from
about half in 2010 to about a quarter in 2012. The
patterns also differed for people in the two age
groups who received substance abuse treatment.
Mental Health Treatment Estimates After
we adjusted for race or ethnicity, sex, and resi-
dence in a metropolitan area, we estimated that
before implementation of the ACA dependent
coverage provision (2008­09), 30.70 percent
of people ages 18­25 with possible mental dis-
orders had received any mental health treatment
in the previous twelve months (Exhibit 4). The
comparable figure for people ages 26­35 was
44.97 percent.
The older group's service use declined by 3.16
percentage points in the post period (2011­12),
whereas the younger group's service use in-
creased by 2.16 percentage points (Exhibit 4).
Comparing trends in the two groups provided
the main difference-in-differences estimate: a
5.32-percentage-point increase for the younger
group compared to the older one after the ACA
dependent coverage provision was imple-
mented. This is equivalent to a 17.3 percent in-
crease over the baseline rate (5.32 percentage
points divided by 30:70 percent ¼ 17:3 percent).
Comparedtopeopleages26­35,thoseages18­
25 who used mental health treatment in the pre-
vious year were significantly more likely after
implementation of the ACA dependent coverage
provision to have reported that their most recent
treatment was paid for by private insurance
(12.94 percentage points) and significantly less
likely to report that treatment was received with-
out health insurance payment (-12.43 percent-
age points) (Exhibit 4). These changes were very
large, considering that 29.44 percent of the
younger group at baseline said that their last
treatment had been paid for by private insur-
ance, and 59.88 percent reported that treatment
was received without health insurance payment.
In contrast to our hypothesis, there were no
significant changes among people ages 18­25
relative to people ages 26­35 using mental
health treatment in the type or setting of treat-
ment in the previous twelve months or in the
percentage of people with private insurance
who reported that their coverage included men-
tal health treatment.

treatment, an even smaller fraction (8.84 per-
cent) of those ages 18­25 with possible sub-
stance use disorders received any treatment in
the previous year before implementation of the
ACA dependent coverage provision (Exhibit 5).
We found no significant changes in treatment
use after the provision's implementation be-
tween the younger and oldergroups in our study.
As with mental health treatment, we examined
payer sources for substance abuse treatment in
theprevious year(respondents could report mul-
tiple payment sources for substance abuse, how-
ever). The coefficients for these estimates were
in the hypothesized direction: The trends were
toward an increase in payment from both private
insurance and Medicaid and toward less un-
insured care among people ages 18­25, relative
to those ages 26­35 (Exhibit 5). However, these
estimates were not significant (estimates were
imprecise because of smaller sample sizes using
treatment). There were no significant changes in
settings for substance abuse treatment in the
previous year for the younger group relative to
the older group.
Finally, we examined changes in reported cov-
erage of alcohol and drug treatment among the
people in our sample with private insurance.
Before implementation of the ACA dependent
coverage provision, 64.83 percent of younger
adults in the sample said that their coverage in-
cluded alcohol treatment, and 65.09 percent said
it included drug treatment (we excluded people
who responded "don't know") (Exhibit 5).
During the study period the percentages of the
younger adultsreporting coverageof alcohol and
drug treatment remained relatively constant, but
the percentages declined substantially for the
older adults. Thus, after implementation of the
ACA dependent coverage provision, coverage of
alcohol treatment was 13.01 percentage points
higher among the younger group than before
implementation, relative to the older group,
and coverage of drug treatment was 12.68 per-
centage points higher.
Full-Sample Estimates In addition, we ex-
amined regressions using the full population--
that is, not only people with possible mental
health or substance use disorders. These regres-
sions illuminated the potential impacts of the
provision on people with less severe symptoms
who may still receive treatment. They also cap-
tured any changes in the burden of symptoms
related to the implementation of the provision.
These results are displayed in the online Appen-
dix,22 along with other additional sensitivity an-
alyses.
In the full sample, the use of mental health
treatment increased by 1.30 percentage points
(95% CI: -0.01, 2.62) after 2010 among people
ages 18­25, relative to those ages 26­35. On an
absolute scale, this is a much smaller change
than the 5.32-percentage-point reduction in
the subsample with possible mental health prob-
lems. However, it represents a 12.1 percent rela-
tive increase over the baseline treatment rate of
10.8 percent (in comparison, the relative change
for the subsample with mental health problems
was 17.3 percent, as explained above).
Full-sample estimates for mental health payer
source and treatment setting or type were also
similar to the subgroup estimates. There were
no significant changes after implementation of

the provision in substance abuse treatment use,
payer source, or setting in the full sample among
the younger group, compared to the older group.
Discussion
We examined the early impacts of the ACA de-
pendent coverage provision on mental health
and substance abuse treatment among young
adults. Our study had four main findings.
First, the provision substantially increased the
use of mental health treatment among people
ages 18­25 with possible mental illnesses, rela-
tive to similar people ages 26­35. Second, there
was a 12.43-percentage-point decline in un-
insured mental health visits among the younger
age group relative to the older one and a com-
mensurate increase in visits paid for by private
insurance, as well as an increase in visits paid for
by Medicaid. Third, there was no significant
change in the use of substance abuse treatment
overall. Fourth, more people ages 18­25 who
had private insurance reported that their plan
covered drug and alcohol treatment after imple-
mentation of the provision, relative to people
ages 26­35.
Our findings related to mental health treat-
ment are consistent with other work suggesting
that private insurance became a greater payer
for these treatments among young adults after
the ACA dependent coverage provision4,5,29 and
that mental health treatment increased in that
age group relative to others.6,10 As findings from
the Oregon study suggest,11 there may be pent-up
demand for mental health treatment among the
uninsured, whofrequently do not seek treatment
because of cost concerns.30
It is also important to consider the context of
the mental health findings. Some estimated
changes among young adults occurred because
of relative, instead of absolute, increases in the
outcomes. For example, the use of any mental
health services among people ages 18­25 in-
creased only slightly during the study period,
while the same outcome decreased among peo-
ple ages 26­35.
Caution is also warranted because our study
period was relatively short. In addition, despite
significant findings, some outcomes for people
ages 18­25 did not follow a consistent trend from
year to year in unadjusted analysis.
The study period included the aftermath of an
economic downturn that disproportionately af-
fected young adults.24 The ACA dependent cover-
age provision potentially smoothed out disrup-
tions in access to care that might otherwise have
occurred among young adults. That said, effects
might have been different during a period of
economic expansion.
The dependent coverage provision shifted
mental health treatment costs for young adults
to private insurers. However, the increase in pre-
miums to employers and other enrollees are like-
ly to have been relatively low, since relatively few

young adults use these services intensively. For
example, at one large employer, expenses for
adult dependent coverage enrollees were higher
than those for other comparable adults. None-
theless, the group enrolling through the ACA
dependent coverage provision increased overall
expenditures by only 0.2 percent.10 Before imple-
mentationof theprovision, theCentersfor Medi-
care and Medicaid Services estimated that it
would increase premiums by about 0.7 percent.31
In contrast to mental health treatment, we
found that there was no relative increase in the
use of substance abuse treatment. Previous work
focusing on state substance abuse parity found
that the policy--which lowered the cost of treat-
ment--also increased admissions.32 However,
other studies have found that policies that re-
duce the cost of substance abuse treatment have
a larger effect on shifting payer type for people
already in treatment than they do on increasing
access.33
One potential explanation is that expanded
coverage, on its own, may be insufficient to in-
crease demand for substance abuse treatment.
Experience with the 2006 health reform in Mas-
sachusetts suggests that barriers such as copay-
ments may continue to deter the use of services
among those needing treatment.34 Noneconomic
barriers such as stigma are widespread35 and may
deter newly insured young adults from seeking
substance abuse treatment. A limited supply of
substance abuse treatment providers and wait-
ing lists to enter treatment could also deter some
newly insured people from seeking care.36
In addition to increasing coverage for previ-
ously uninsured people, the ACA dependent cov-
erage provision may also have affected young
adults who already had private insurance in their
own name but chose to switch to their parents'
plans to take advantage of more comprehensive
benefits.3 This is consistent with our finding that
mental health and substance abuse coverage in-
creased during the study period among young
adults relative to the comparison group. Sub-
stance abuse benefits in particular have histori-
cally been restricted in many private insurance
plans.37 In our sample, fewer than two-thirds of
the respondents ages 18­25 believed that their
coverage included alcohol or drug treatment be-
fore implementation of the ACA provision.
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equi-
ty Act of 2008--which requires most private in-
surers to offer behavioral health benefits that are
comparable to physical health benefits--is an-
other major piece of federal legislation. It could
conceivably have affected young adults dis-
proportionately. However, reports indicate that
implementation of parity was slow,38 and rules
were not finalized until 2013.39
The federal parity law is one example of how
the dependent coverage provision must be con-
sidered in the context of broader health system
changes. In 2014 the ACA made new Medicaid
funding available to cover poor adults--an ex-
pansion that roughly half the states have opted
to adopt thus far. Additionally, coverage through
new health insurance Marketplaces was imple-
mented nationally. In combination, new cover-
age provisions are expected to increase the num-
ber of insured people by twenty-five million.40
One possibility is that new health insurance
options, coupled with more publicity about re-
ceiving care, will increase the awareness of treat-
ment options and the demand for mental health
and substance abuse treatment, particularly
among people who have not previously used
such treatment. However, provider capacity in
areas with higher demand could be strained,
which would limit access.41
Conclusion
The ACA dependent coverage provision appears
to be a stepping-stone toward increasing mental
health treatment among young adults with pos-
sible mental health problems. The act may also
improve the comprehensiveness of substance
abuse coverage for young adults with substance
use disorders.
The long-term success of this provision will
depend on whether or not it links young adults
needing treatment to providers in their commu-
nities and ensures continuity of treatment. En-
abling people to remain in the care of their cur-
rent providers may help ease transitions across
insurance plans. Young adults with treatment
needs are also likely to benefit from initiatives
to increase chronic disease management and in-
tegrate physical health care with other social and
behavioral health services. 
The ACA dependent
coverage provision
appears to be a
stepping-stone toward
increasing mental
health treatment
among young adults.
