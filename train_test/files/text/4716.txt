ABSTRACT
The health effects of low-dose radiation (LDR) have been the concern of the
academic spheres, regulatory bodies, governments, and the public. Among these
effects, the most important is carcinogenesis. In view of the importance of immune
surveillance in cancer control, the dose-response relationship of the changes in
different cell types of the immune system after whole-body irradiation is analyzed on
the basis of systemic data from the author's laboratory in combination with recent
reports in the literature. For T lyrnphocytes ]- or inverted j-shaped curves are usually
demonstrated after irradiation, while for macrophages dose-response curves of
chiefly stimulation with irregular patterns are often observed. The intercellular
reactions between the antigen presenting cell (APC) and T lymphocyte (TLC) in
the immunologic synapse via expression of surface molecules and secretion of
cytokines by the two cell types after different doses of radiation are illustrated. The
different pathways of signal transduction thus facilitated in the T lymphocyte by
different doses of radiation are analyzed to explain the mechanism of the phenom-
enon of low-dose stimulation and high-dose suppression of immunity. Experimental
and clinical data are cited to show that LDR retards tumor growth, reduces metasta-
sis, increases the efficacy of conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy as well as
alleviates the suppression of immunity due to tumor burden. The incidence of
thymic lymphoma after high-dose radiation is lowered by preexposure to low-dose
radiation, and its mechanism is supposed to be related to the stimulation of antican-
cer immunity induced by low-dose radiation. Recent reports on lowering of stan-
dardized cancer mortality rate and all cause death rate of cohorts occupationally
exposed to low-dose radiation from the US, UK, and Canada are cited.

INTRODUCTION
Currently, the linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis is adopted for cancer risk
assessment in radiation protection, which is based on observations from the carci-
nogenic effect of high-doses of ionizing radiation (UNSCEAR 1994; NCRP 2001).
However, data from inhabitants in areas of high natural radioactivity and workers in
nuclear industry have not shown increase in cancer risk after exposure to low-dose
radiation. The LNT hypothesis emphasizes the stochastic nature of DNA damage
caused by ionizing radiation. However, it should be emphasized that the defense
and adaptive reactions in the body are often activated by low-dose radiation and
down-regulated by high-dose radiation. Among these reactions antioxidants, DNA
repair, apoptosis of damaged cells, adaptive response in mutagenesis, and immune
surveillance are important ones (Yamaoka et al. 1991; Feinendegen et al. 1995;
Kondo 1993; Zhou et al. 1993; Rigaud and Moustacchi 1996). The present paper
concentrates on the analysis of the dose-response relationship in the immune system
after whole-body irradiation (WBI).
Establishment of dose-response relationship of biological parameters is one of
the key topics in radiobiology research. Due to the importance of immune surveil-
lance against cancer and infection, radiation effect on the immune system has been
one of the chief research fields in radiation biology and radiation protection.
However, in most previous studies only the changes in immunity after exposure to
doses above 0.2 Gy were observed, thus usually giving rise to a linear or quadratic
dose-response curve (Liu and Liu 1990; Liu 1996; Yamaoka et al. 1991). When the
effect of doses of 0.2 Gy and lower are studied, usually a ]- or inverted j-shaped curve
can be demonstrated for parameters of the lymphocytes, and curves showing chiefly
stimulation with irregular patterns are often observed for macrophages. Elucidation
of the characteristics of these dose-response curves is of importance in understand-
ing the manifestations and mechanisms of immunologic changes induced by differ-
ent doses of ionizing radiation.
Since the 1980s of the last century radiation effect on the immune system has
been a constituent part of many important international conferences concerning
the biological effects of low-dose radiation (Sagan 1987; Sugahara et al. 1992; Liu
1994; Yamada et al. 2000; Burkart et al. 2002), and there have been many peer-
reviewed papers discussing the stimulatory effect of low-dose radiation on immunity
in international journals (Troup and Anderson 1982; Liu et al. 1987; James and
Makinodan 1988; Makinodan and James 1990; Anderson 1992; Liu 1992, 1995;
Hattori 1994). However, not many of these involve the dose-response relationship
of ionizing radiation-induced immune changes. In 1994 in its report to the UN
General Assembly, UNSCEAR for the first time recognized the adaptive response
induced by low-dose radiation (UNSCEAR Report 1994 to the General Assembly of
United Nations). In this document stimulation of immunity induced by low-dose
radiation was included in adaptive responses. However, its mechanism and influ-
ence on cancer risks were not fully analyzed. Since the publication of UNSCEAR
1994 report, more scientific data have been accumulated in international literature,

making it possible to give an analysis of the topic in more depth. In the present
paper three aspects of the effect of ionizing radiation on the immune system will be
analyzed, that is, dose-response relationship of immunologic parameters, mechanis-
tic studies on low-dose stimulation of immunity, and the implications in relation to
cancer risks.
DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP OF RADIATION-INDUCED
IMMUMOLOGICAL CHANGES
The dose-response relationship of immunological parameters following expo-
sure to ionizing radiation is affected by a number of factors. Most important among
these are the target cells under observation and the experimental design. When the
lymphocytes and related functions are studied, a ]- or inverted j-shaped dose-
response curve is usually observed. If the macrophages and related functions are
under study, chiefly stimulation with irregular patterns may appear over the usual
dose range within 10 Gy. In order to confirm the existence of stimulation by low-
dose radiation in animal models, experimental design may be a critical factor. Dose
range, dose spacing, and dose rate as well as temporal relationship of the changes
are crucial in the experimental design. Usually three orders of magnitude have to
be chosen for the dose range, that is, from 0.01 to 10 Gy and within this range 3-4
doses are necessary for each of the dose ranges of 0.01-0.1 Gy, 0.1-1 Gy, and 1-10
Gy with 10 or more dose points. In the author's laboratory, for whole-body irradia-
tion (WBI) with X-rays in Kunming mice usually 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 Gy and sham-irradiated control are used to construct a dose-
response curve in most immunological studies evaluating the response of lympho-
cytes to whole-body irradiation (Liu 1992, 1995; Liu et a1. 1992). For more radiore-
sistant parameters, such as NK activity and ADCC activity, more doses in the higher
end are needed, e.g., extending to 10, 12, and 14 Gy, in order to reveal the
suppressive effect (Llu et a1. 1992; Fan and Liu 1989).
The stimulatory effect of low-dose radiation on immunity has been documented
(Troup and Andersonl982; Liu eta1. 1987; james and Makinodan 1988; Makinodan
and james 1990; Anderson 1992; Liu 1992, 1995, 1996; Hattori 1994). However, the
dose-response relationship of the immunologic changes, especially in a coordinated
manner synthesizing various effects at different levels, has not been reported. In the
present paper 52 immunologic parameters in two categories are pooled to construct
dose-effect curves. The dose-effect relationship of one category consisting of 20
parameters shows a j-shaped curve (left upper panel of Figure 1) .These parameters
include: (1) cell activities, such as cell cycle control, cell survival (apoptosis): (2)
surface molecules, such as CTLA-4; (3) cytokines, such as IL-lO and IL-4 synthesis,
(4) signal molecules, such as cAMP and cAMP to cGMP ratio, protein kinase A and
phospholipase A2, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR). Up-regulation of all these pa-
rameters in the immune organs would lead to decreased immune activity. They are
down-regulated after LDR, and that of the second category consisting of 32 param-

eters shows an inverted J-shaped curve (right upper panel of Figure 1). These
parameters include: (1) cell number, such as thymocyte count, splenocyte count,
peripheral blood WBC count; (2) cell activity. such as spontaneous 3H-TdR incor-
poration into thymocytes, proliferative reaction of splenocytes to Con A and LPS.
PFC reaction ofspleen. NK and ADCC activity ofsplenocytes; (3) cytokine secretion.
such as, IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion. (4) surface molecule expression, such as:

such as UDS. ribonucleotide reductase. DNA polymerase (total and Pactivity); (6)
signal molecules. such as free calcium ion concentration, cGMP content, p38MAPK.
Up-regulation of these parameters in the immune organs would lead to increased
immune activity. They are up-regulated after low-dose radiation. These curves were
constructed each with 10-11 doses ranging from ato 10 Gy (Liu 1996; Liu et al.
1994a. 1996, 2000. 2001; Liu and Xie 2000; Liu et al. 2001a. 2001b; Sun and Liu
2000a). In many studies in the literature doses below 0.2 Gy were often neglected,
thus the effect of low-dose radiation would be missed. This is shown in the lower
panels ofFigure 1 in which data with doses of 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, and 0.2 Gywere
omitted. thus giving rise to quadratic curves instead of the J- or inverted j-shaped
curves.

Nonlinear Dose-Effect Relationship in Radiation Immunology
Another factor is the strain of animal used. When the irradiation conditions
remain the same, different strains of mice may react differently to low-dose radia-
tion. Take the proliferative reaction oflymphocytes to Con A as an example, BALBI
c mice and C57BL/6 mice may react in an opposite direction (Shankar B et aJ.
1999). When C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice were exposed to fractionated low-dose
radiation (0.04 GyI day,S days/week, total dose 0.2 Gy) and subsequently stimulated
with Con A, the proliferation of spleen cells in response to Con A as measured by
3H-TdR incorporation was significantly higher in 0.2 Gy-irradiated C57BL/6 mice
when compared with that in the Con A-stimulated cells from sham-irradiated con-
trols, but the same response was suppressed by 0.2 Gy in BALBIc mice. The
augmentation of response to Con A in C57BL/6 mice was marked by the decrease
in the proportion of cells expressing p53 as estimated by flow cytometry. A reduction
in expression of p53 was accompanied by reduced apoptosis in the Con A-stimulated
spleen cells of irradiated C57BL/6 mice when compared with that in the sham-
treated controls. However, the splenic cells of BALB/c mice showed exactly oppo-
site profiles in this respect. The Kunming strain and C57BL/6 strains of mice react
to low-dose radiation similarly (Liu 1995, 1996, 1998). Thus, alteration in the
immune response following low-dose radiation is evidently affected by the strain of
mice used. It has been reported that BALBIc mice are more sensitive to cancer
induction by radiation than C57BL/6 mice due to the genetic instability induced by
radiation in the former strain of mice (Ponnaiya et aJ. 1997).
For BALBIc mice the stimulatory effect of the low-dose radiation may be condi-
tioned by the dose rate used, e.g.,a dose rate of 15 mGy/min or lower would usually
be effective in eliciting a stimulating effect with total doses of 77 and 106 mGy,
resulting in doubling the proliferation rate to that of sham-irradiated control, but
a dose rate of 200 mGyI min with the same total dose may not be effective in eliciting
stimulation of proliferation in BALBIc mice (Su etaJ. 1997). In this experiment the
proliferative response of splenocytes to Con A was observed in BALBIc mice
measured by 3H-TdR incorporation after whole-body X-irradiation (Table 1).
The temporal changes of the biological parameter under study may sometimes
also influence the shape of the dose-response curve. It is especially important when
"overcompensation stimulation" is concerned in the mechanism of the hormetic
effect (Calabrese 2001). As listed in this article, the hormetic effect elicited by a
number of chemical agents showed an inverted j-shaped curve only at a certain time
point after the administration of the chemical agent. The same may be true for some
of radiation-induced effects. Take apoptosis as an example, a J-shaped dose-re-
sponse curve was demonstrated both for thymocytes 24 h after WBI of mice (mea-
suring DNA fragmentation with fluorescence staining using DAPI) and for EL-4
cells 24 h after in vitroX-irradiation (measuring apoptotic bodies with flow cytometry)
[Llu et aI. 1996). In these two cases a statistically significant decrease in apoptosis
rate occurred at doses of 0.05 and 0.075 Gy, but the decrease was not statistically
significant at the dose of 0.025 Gy. A further study measuring apoptosis in frozen
sections of different immune organs, including thymus, spleen, mesenteric lymph

nodes and Peyers patches with TUNEL (terminal deoxynuleotidyl transferase-
mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) also demonstrated j-shaped curves of apoptosis
12 h after WEI (Liu eta1. 2000). Again, a statistically significant decrease in apoptosis
rate was observed after doses of 0.05 and 0.075 Gy, but not after 0.025 Gy. Time
course studies revealed a brief increase in apoptosis rate 1 h after irradiation with
these doses, but the magnitude was greater after 0.05 and 0.075 Gy than that after
0.025 Gy. It was supposed that a certain magnitude of initial DNA damage triggering
an increase in apoptosis was required in order to stimulate a compensatory reaction
that would be able to clear the apoptotic cells to a level significantly below the
control base line in the course of 12 h. An example is given in Table 2 showing the
time course of the changes in apoptosis rate in the cortex of thymus assayed with
TUNEL.
It is seen in this table that a higher abrupt early increases in apoptosis rate
(>150%) in the first hour after 0.05 and 0.075 Gy was followed by an "overcompen-
sation" at 12 h with the apoptosis rate going down to below control. The mechanism
of the "overcompensation" may of course consist of a number of defense reactions,
including increased DNA repair elicited by low-dose radiation.
However, in many other cases direct stimulation may be the mechanism of the
hormetic effect. Take the dose-effect curve of thymocyte cAMP I cGMP ratio and the
activity of its downstream molecule protein kinase A (PKA) as an example, a
j-shaped curve was demonstrated 24 h after whole-body irradiation as shown in
Figure 2 (Liu 1998; Liu and Xie 2000).
The time course studies showed that there was statistically significant drop in
cAMP/cGMP ratio beginning from 8 h after whole-body irradiation with 0.075 Cy,
reaching its nadir at 24 h, and no rise above control was observed even as early as

30 min after irradiation. This change in cAMP/ cGMP ratio is due to both up-
regulation of cGMP and down-regulation of cAMP after low-dose radiation. The
opposite is true for the time course after a higher dose (2 Gy). The same pattern of
the time course of PKA was also demonstrated after low and high-doses of radiation.
These data may speak for a direct effect of low-dose radiation but not due to
"overcompensation".
The dose-response relationship of changes in macrophages after exposure to
ionizing radiation is apparently different from that of the T lymphocytes. Most of
the parameters studied showed a pattern of chiefly stimulation from low to high-
doses of ionizing radiation. Examples are given in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 shows
the changes in expression of surface molecules B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) on
peritoneal macrophages after whole-body irradiation and on J77 4A.l cells (a mouse
macrophage cell line) after in vitro irradiation (Liu et a1. 2001). The changes in
secretion of cytokines are given in Figure 4 in which the upper left and right panels
show, respectively, the secretion oflL-l ~ and TNFa after WEI, and the lowerleft and
right panels show, respectively, the secretion of IL-12p70 by LPS-stimulated perito-
neal macrophages after whole-body irradiation and the expression of CD48 on

MECHANISTIC STUDIES ON LOW-DOSE STIMULATION OF IMMUNITY
The stimulation of immunity by low-dose radiation is a complex process concern-
ing intercellular reactions within the immune system (Liu 1995, 1998; Llu et al.
200l) and signal transduction in the immune cells (Weichselbaum 1991; Hallahan
et al. 1993; Liu et al. 1994a,b; He and Liu 2000; He et al. 2000, 2001; Pajonk and
McBride 2001). Changes in the expression of surface molecules and the secretion
of cytokines are accompanied with the induction of relevant genes and the expres-
sion of corresponding proteins (Liu et al. 2000, 2001; Sun and Liu 1998, 2000a; lin
etal. 2001; Liu et al. 2001a,b). It has been demonstrated in mice that these molecular
changes induced by low-dose radiation constitute a unique pattern distinctly differ-
ent from those caused by high-dose radiation (Liu 1995, 1998; Liu et al. 1996, 2000;
Liu et al. 2001a). Low-dose radiation acts on both the APCs and T lymphocytes,
facilitating the intercellular reactions within the immunmologic synapse (Malissen
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, Nov l , 2003 79
Shu-Zheng Liu
1999) formed between these two categories of immune cells (Figure 5). It stimulates
the expression of a number of surface molecules and modulates the secretion of
certain cytokines (Liu et al. 2001; Sun and Liu 1998, 2000a; jin et al. 2001; Liu et al.
2001a,b). Low-dose radiation stimulates the expression of B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2
(CD86) molecules on and secretion oflL-12p70 by the macrophages as well as the
expression of TCR/CD3 (Liu et a1. 1995) and CD2 (Sambani et a1. 1996), CD4 and
CD28 (Liu et al. 2001) on the lymphocytes and down-regulates IL-IO synthesis by T
cells together with decreased CTLA-4 expression, and high-dose radiation exerts
opposite effects on these parameters ofthe T cells (Liu et al. 2001; Liu etal. 2001a,b).
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, there is a significant increase in secretion of TNFa,
IL-lj3, and IL-12p70 by the macrophages in response to whole-body irradiation of
mice (Sun and Liu 1998, 2000a). In the immunological synapse, in addition to
CD80/86 and CD28/CTLA-4, CD48 of macrophages and CD2 of lymphocytes are
also important costimulating molecules regulating the immune response. It has
been reported that low-dose radiation strongly enhanced the expression of CD2,
both in PHA-stimulated and in resting human T lymphocytes, as demonstrated by
a rosette assay or by immunofluorescence (Sambanmi et al. 1996). Flow cytometrk
analysis showed that in vitro irradiation ofEL-4 (mouse lymphoma) cells resulted in

enhanced expression of CD2 after low-dose radiation and its down-regulation after
high-dose radiation, giving rise to an inverted j-shaped dose-response curve and
expression of CD48 on 1774A.l cells responded similarly (unpublished data). It is
seen that both low and high-doses of radiation caused up-regulation of surface
molecules on the macrophages (except CD48) and increased secretion of IL-12.
Thus, the differential response of the immune reactions to low- vs. high-dose
radiation chiefly depends on distinct changes of the T lymphocytes. So far, as the
surface molecules CD80/86 and CD28/CTLA-4 as well the cytokines IL-12/IL-1O
are concerned, this opposite relationship of the changes in surface molecule expres-
sion on and cytokine secretion by the lymphocytes after low and high-doses of
radiation and its impact on the final outcome of the immune response are illus-
trated in the diagram in Figure 6 (Llu et a1. 2001). It is shown in this diagram that
low-dose radiation up-regulates the T cell activity, especially in favor of THI.
Only part of the intercellular changes in the immune system induced by low-dose
radiation vs. high-dose radiation are included in this diagrammatic illustration.

Changes in other surface molecules and cytokines, as described in previous sections
of the present paper, also play important roles.
It is quite clear that research on the molecular basis of the changes in the
intercellular reactions after different doses of ionizing radiation in recent years has
promoted the understanding of the nature of hormetic effect of low-dose radiation
on immunity. The signals from APCs are absolutely necessary for the activation of
lymphocytes in response to low-dose radiation (Ltu et al. 2001). The part played by
the APCs (macrophages) is essential for the realization of low-dose radiation-
induced immunolgic stimulation because depletion of these cells from the spleno-
cyte suspension obtained from the low-dose-irradiated mice will lead to the disap-
pearance of the stimulatory effect. The up-regulation of expression of surface
molecules (CD48, CD80, CD86) on APCs and increase in secretion of cytokines (IL-
12, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha) by APCs after exposure to low-dose radiation are crucial
factors for up-regulation of T cell activity. On the other hand, all these changes
except the down-regulated expression of CD48 are also observed after exposure to
high-dose radiation (2 Gy). Thus, T lymphocytes play an even more important role
in determining the fate of the immune response since the expression of their
surface molecules (TCR, CD2, CD28, CTLA-4) changes in opposite directions after
low and high-doses of radiation, and, even more, the secretion of IL-lO is down-
regulated after low-dose radiation and up-regulated after high-dose radiation. De-
spite the fact that the expression of CD80 and CD86 on and the secretion of IL-12
by the APCs are sustained at a high level after high-dose radiation, the down-
regulated CD28 expression and up-regulated expression of CTLA-4 on and in-
creased IL-10 secretion by the lymphocytes after high-dose radiation will ultimately
lead to down-regulation of T cell activation. Therefore, it is these distinct dose-
dependent changes in the lymphocytes that determine the final outcome of im-
mune response.
The molecular changes in the immunologic synapse would apparently reinforce
the facilitation of the signal transduction in the lymphocyte initiated by the action
of low-dose radiation. There have been reports on the effect of ionizing radiation
on lymphocyte signal transduction (Weichhselbaum 1991; Hallahan eta1. 1993; Liu
et a1. 1994a,b; He and Liu 2000; He et al. 2000, 2001; Pajonk and McBride 2001).
Low-dose radiation may facilitate the transduction in multiple signal pathways,
including the protein kinase C/calcium ion (PKC/[Ca2+
L) system, cyclic adenosine
monophosphate/protein kinase A (cAMP/PKA) system, phospholipase A2/
prosdaglandin E2 (PLA2/PGE2) system, and others. The effect of low-dose radia-
tion on these signal pathways may be schematically illustrated in Figure 7.
In Figure 7 it is shown that low-dose radiation may act on the two categories of
immune cells (APC and TLC) directly or via the reactive oxidative species (ROS) to
influence the expression oftheir surface molecules and secretion ofrelevant cytokines
within the immunologic synapse as described in previous sections. On the left side
in the middle part of Figure 7 three signal pathways and their interrelationship are
illustrated. Among these the up-regulation of PKC/[Ca2+
Lis chiefly due to the

activation of phospholipase C/phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PLC/PIP2) (Ltu
1992). The facilitation of the PKC/ [Ca2+
Lpathway would lead to the activation of
transcription factors (TFs) , among which nuclear translocation of NF-KB has been
observed (He and Liu 2000; He et al. 2000, 2001). Calphostin C (CPS in the figure),
a PKC inhibitor, was found to be able to block low-dose radiation-induced increase
in nuclear translocation ofNF-KB (unpublished data). On the other hand, tetramethyl
benzidine-8 (TMB-8), a calcium antagonist, could completely suppress the low-dose
radiation-induced augmentation of thymocyte proliferation (Ltu 1998; Liu and Xie
2000). Therefore, the facilitation of PKC/ [Ca 2+
L pathway may occupy a pivotal
position in low-dose radiation-induced up-regulation of T cell activation. Low-dose
radiation decreases cAMP content and lowers cAMP/ cCMP ratio in thymocytes
accompanied with decreased activity of its down-stream molecule PKA (refer to
Figure 3). These changes are related to the up-regulation of expression of CD3/
CD28 with activation of phosphodiesterase7 (PDE7) (Llu 1998; Liu and Xie 2000;
Li et al. 1999). The decrease in cAMP content may be a direct result of the activation
of Cai (inhibitory a subunit of C protein), and the significance of the changes in
this signal pathway has been tested by the addition of cholera toxin (CT) to the
cultured thymocytes to activate Cs (stimulatory subunit of C protein). It was found
that CT added to thymocytes obtained from low-dose-irradiated mice could partially

alleviate the stimulation of thymocyte proliferation induced by low-dose radiation
(Liu and Xie 2000). In addition, the lowering of the activity of phospholipase A2
(PLA2) in the thymocytes after low-dose radiation may further decrease the cAMP
content via prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (Mele eta1. 2000; Ribardo eta1. 2001; McHowat
et a1. 2001). The changes in these three signal pathways would converge on the
activation of transcription factors, which would increase the transcription of genes
related to immune response. In the diagram up-regulation of IFNy and IL-2 genes
are shown as representatives (Liu et a1. 2000). It is shown on the right side of the
diagram that increased secretion of IL-l ~ could positively feedback to stimulate the
APC (Ltu 1998), and the rise of nitric oxide (NO) and ROS induced by TNFa. (Sun
and Liu 2000b) may exert direct stimulation to the transcription factors (TFs). The
ultimate result, as shown at the bottom of the diagram, is T lymphocyte activation
and proliferation, which would lead to clonal expansion and potentiation of anti-
cancer immune activity.
The time course of the changes in signal molecules after whole-body irradiation
with 0.075 Gy is shown in Figure 8. It can be seen that all the signal molecules reach
their peak or nadir at 12 to 24 h after whole-body irradiation. Among these 10
parameters [Ca 2+

lated after low-dose radiation, with the first three reaching their peak at 24 h, and
the last three reaching their peak at 12 h, while cAMP, cAMP / cGMP ratio, PKA, and
PLA2 are down-regulated after low-dose radiation, all reaching their nadir at 24 h
(Liu 1998; Liu and Xie 2000). These data further demonstrate the influence of
temporal factor in construction of the 1- or inverted j-shaped curves because most
of the changes usually take 12 to 24 h to come to their peak or nadir.
Recent studies showed the interrelationship between cytokines and surface mol-
ecules, further supporting our analysis of the molecular mechanisms of immune
responses evoked by different doses of radiation (Kubin et a1. 1994; Dickensheets et
a1. 2000). It has also been demonstrated that other signal molecules may join the
cohort of events evoked by low-dose radiation among which p38MAPK (mitogen-
activated protein kinase) is an important one acting jointly with PLC (phospholi-
pase C) and PKC (Shimizu et a1. 1999).
IMPLICATIONS IN CANCER RISKS
It is well known that most carcinogens are immunosupressants (Ball 1970; Urso
and Gengozian 1982; Bebb eta1. 2002; Laupeze et a1. 2002). Ionizing radiation is one
of these when delivered at moderate to high-doses. Immune surveillance is one of
the most important defense mechanisms in the body monitoring the development
of cancer (Dunn eta1. 2000) . As reviewed in the previous sections, low-dose radiation
stimulates T cell activity. The significance of these immunologic changes in radia-
tion-induced cancer is still a question of debate. In UNSCEAR 1994 report, it was
stated that "it remains doubtful whether the immune system plays a significant role
in any of the adaptive responses at low-doses.... the immune system may not playa
major role in moderating human radiation oncogenesis, although immune func-
tion in certain organs may ensure that some early neoplastic cells are eliminated
before they become established". NCRP Report No. 136 (NCRP 2001) also briefly
discussed the adaptive response induced by low-dose radiation. It is stated that "in
the ultimate instance of cancer in vivo, the adaptive response may take the form of
an immune surveillance of preneoplastic cells. This is certainly a possibility, but it
is difficult to design laboratory experiments to test it". In a recent commentary
article on radiation hormesis it is recognized that "under appropriate conditions,
exposure to Xrays or gamma rays at doses below those causing immunosuppressive
effects has been observed to augment various immune responses in mice..." but "the
mechanisms of the observed enhancement remain to be elucidated in full..."
(Upton 2000). These statements accept the importance of experimental data on
low-dose radiation-induced up-regulation of certain immune functions and im-
mune surveillance of cancer formation on one hand and question its significance
in the analysis of cancer risk assessment on the other. There have been accumulat-
ing data disclosing the cellular and molecular mechanisms of low-dose radiation-
induced increase in antitumor immunity in animal models as reviewed in the
present paper. Low-dose radiation increases cellular antioxidant activity, facilitates

DNA damage repair, reduces cell mutagenesis, and stimulates immune surveillance.
All these may contribute to the effect of low-dose radiation on the reduction of
cancer incidence. There have been experimental studies illustrating the suppressive
effect of low-dose radiation on tumor growth, metastasis, and carcinogenesis as well
as increased anticancer immunity, including enhanced NK and CTL activity as well
as increased IFNy and IL-2 secretion, and all these data point to the significance of
immune responses up-regulated by low-dose radiation in cancer control (Li et al.
1996, 1998; Fu et aI. 1996, 1997; Zhang and Llu 1996; jin et al. 1997; Zhang et al.
1997a,b, 1998a,b, 1999; Li et aI. 1999a,b). It was shown that preirradiation with low-
dose radiation decreased the growth rate and metastasis of implanted B16 mela-
noma and Lewis lung cancer in C57BL/6j mice. In a well-recognized model of
thymic lymphoma induced by fractionated whole-body irradiation (1.75 Gy once a
week for 4 consecutive weeks) in C57BL/6j mice, a low-dose radiation (0.075 Gy)
6-12 h preceding each fractionated high-dose radiation could reduce the lym-
phoma incidence from 43.3% in the control (exposed to only the high-dose radia-
tion) to 15.1% (high-dose radiation being preceded by 0.075 Gy, with an interval of
6 h) and 17.6% (high-dose radiation being preceded by 0.075 Gy, with an interval
of 12 h) in 6 months after the fractionated exposures (Li et al. 1998; Li et al.
1999a,b). It was found that the low-dose radiation-induced suppression of tumor
growth, metastasis, and incidence of lymphoma were accompanied with enhance-
ment of anticancer immune reactions (Zhang et al. 1998a; Li et al. 1998, 1999a).
Figure 9 shows experimental data illustrating that low-dose radiation retards cancer
growth, reduces metastasis, increases efficacy of chemotherapy of cancer, and alle-
viates immune suppression caused by tumor burden (Fu et al. 1996; Li et al. 1993;
Zhang et al. 1997b, 1999). The clinical application of low-dose radiation in the
treatment of cancer has shown enlightening results. When patients with non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma under chemotherapy was given total body or half body (the
thorax) low-dose radiation in a regimen of 0.1 Gy three times a week or 0.15 Gy two
times a week for 5 consecutive weeks with a total dose of 1.5 Gy, the survival rate in
9 years rose to 84% from 50% ofthe control with chemotherapy alone (P<O.Ol). The
low-dose radiation-treated patients showed enhanced anti-cancer immunity
(Sakamoto et al. 1997).
Actually, j-shaped dose-incidence curves have been demonstrated for a number
of cancers induced by exposure to different doses of radiation (Calabrese and
Baldwin 2002). Human epidemiological surveys also showed decreased cancer inci-
dence after exposure to low-dose radiation. Among these the U.S. nuclear shipyard
worker study, the 100-year British radiologists observation and a Canadian occupa-
tional radiation dose registry analysis strongly speak for the possibility of existence
of an hormetic effect of low-dose radiation in cancer incidence since the cohorts
observed in these three reports would probably exclude the "healthy worker effect"
(Matanoski 1991; Berrington et al. 2001; Sont et al. 2001; Baillargeon 2001). These
reports would promote further research in this field, thus accumulating more
scientific data giving impetus to the improvement of the present radiation protec-

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Stimulatory effects of radiation on anticancer immunity with exposure to very
low-doses are becoming more evident with the accumulation of scientific data in the
literature. This situation makes it possible to construct dose-response curves reflect-
ing reality. However, full analysis of existing data is still limited, which may be due
to inaccessibility or neglect of some of the scientific reports. The present paper
tended to review the dose-response relationship of immune parameters after whole-
body X-irradiation and the up-regulation of T cell activity induced by low-dose
radiation with emphasis on its cellular and molecular mechanisms, a research field
advancing along with the rapid progress in modern immunology. Just because of
this situation the review may not be able to cope with the development in this rapidly
advancing field. Further research using modern biochips and related technologies
developed with the advancement of genomics (Dtehn et a1. 2002) and proteomics
(Zhang eta1. 2002) would give great impetus to the understanding of the molecular
