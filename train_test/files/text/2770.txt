Abstract
Background: The prevalence of HIV among U.S. inmates is much greater than in the general population, creating
public health concerns and cost issues for the criminal justice system. The HIV Services and Treatment Implementation
in Corrections protocol of the NIDA funded Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies tested the efficacy of an
organizational process improvement strategy on improving HIV services in correctional facilities.
Methods: For this paper, we analyzed efficacy of this strategy on improving inmate awareness and perceptions of
HIV services. The study used a multi-site (n = 28) clustered randomized trial approach. Facilities randomized to the
experimental condition used a coach-driven local change team approach to improve HIV services at their facility.
Facilities in the control condition were given a directive to improve HIV services on their own. Surveys about awareness
and perceptions of HIV services were administered anonymously to inmates who were incarcerated in study facilities
at baseline (n = 1253) and follow-up (n = 1048). A series of one-way ANOVAs were run to test whether there were
differences between inmates in the experimental and control facilities at baseline and follow-up.
Results: Differences were observed at baseline, with the experimental group having significantly lower scores than the
control group on key variables. But, at post-test, following the intervention, these differences were no longer significant.
Conclusions: Taken in context of the findings from the main study, these results suggest that the change team
approach to improving HIV services in correctional facilities is efficacious for improving inmates' awareness and
perceptions of HIV services.

Background
Persons living in prisons or under criminal justice super-
vision in the community are at high risk for acquiring
HIV, and the prevalence of HIV in criminal justice set-
tings is substantially higher than that of the general
population (Maruschak 2012). In response, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published
guidelines to assist the criminal justice sector in the
adoption of evidence-based practices to reduce inmate
HIV risks and to provide HIV treatment in correctional
settings (CDC 2009). Based on these guidelines, O'Connell
et al. (2013) designed a continuum of care model for HIV
services in correctional settings that includes HIV testing,
prevention and education, and linkage to treatment in the
facility as well as upon reentry to the community.
According to the continuum of care model for HIV in
correctional settings (O'Connell et al. 2013), all persons
are tested for HIV at intake to a correctional facility un-
less they specifically decline (i.e., opt-out testing). If the
result of the test is negative, additional intensive services
are not necessary through most of that person's incarcer-
ation. If an inmate is known to be HIV-positive, or tests
positive for HIV at intake, appropriate treatment, includ-
ing antiretroviral medication, begins immediately and
continues through their incarceration. Prior to release
and community reentry, all inmates regardless of HIV
serostatus, receive an evidence-based HIV prevention
intervention to encourage risk reduction during the

Center for Disease Control's website (CDC Compendium
of Effective Behavioral Interventions 2015) and/or on the
National Registry of Effective Practices and Programs
(2015). These individuals also receive comprehensive dis-
charge planning to promote linkage to continued HIV care
in the community to which they are returning. If all of
these services are implemented according to this model,
the evidence suggests that individual and public health out-
comes would improve for this population (see O'Connell
et al. 2013 for a thorough discussion of the evidence for
these practices).
Many correctional facilities across the United States
now offer most (if not all) of the continuum of HIV ser-
vices; in fact, studies have shown that HIV outcomes
(i.e., viral load suppression and CD4 lymphocyte counts)
for incarcerated populations tend to improve during in-
carceration (Meyer et al. 2014; Baillargeon et al. 2010;
Zaller et al. 2007; Springer et al. 2004; Palepu et al.
2004). However, research has also demonstrated the ex-
istence of many gaps in services along the care continuum
that have resulted in insufficient HIV care, particularly
during the reentry transition back to the community
(Belenko et al. 2013a; Baillargeon et al. 2010; Greifinger
2010; Springer and Altice 2005; Springer et al. 2004).
Implementation science has evolved in health services
research in response to such service gaps. The science has
been important for identifying and understanding strat-
egies for expediting the application of best practices in
diverse populations and service sectors, as well as for
diverse health conditions (Brownson et al. 2012).
In response to the growing emphasis on implementation
science in health and the documented gaps in HIV ser-
vices for correctional populations, the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA) sponsored the Criminal Justice
Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS), a national col-
laborative of investigators on three protocols designed to
test implementation and process improvement strategies
for improving health services for the incarcerated popula-
tion (Ducharme et al. 2013). This article presents data and
analyses from the HIV Services and Treatment in Correc-
tional Settings protocol (HIV-STIC) which was developed
to test an organizational process improvement strategy for
implementing and improving services along the HIV con-
tinuum of care (i.e., prevention, testing, and linkage to
treatment) in correctional facilities in the United States
and Puerto Rico (Belenko et al. 2013b).
Investigators at each of nine research centers participat-
ing in HIV-STIC selected one or two pairs of correctional
facilities in which to implement the study. Paired facilities
were matched based on several factors including state/
territory and type of correctional facility (e.g., security
level, prison or jail). One facility from each pair was ran-
domly assigned to either the experimental or the control
condition. Prior to randomization, selected staff from all
local participating facilities engaged in a one-day train-
ing on evidence-based practices along the HIV care con-
tinuum in correctional settings (for a total of 9 trainings
- one per research center). At the end of the training, all
staff received a directive from an executive in their ad-
ministration to make improvements to services along
the HIV services continuum (i.e., prevention, testing, or
linkage). Staff in facilities randomized to the control con-
dition received follow-up instructions from the executive
to work on improving the services as they normally would.
Staff in facilities randomized to the experimental condi-
tion composed local change teams, facilitated by exter-
nal coaching from individuals trained in the NIATx
process improvement model (McCarty et al. 2007), to
work on improving HIV services. (See Belenko et al.
2013b for a full description of the HIV-STIC protocol
design).
The model of implementation research outcomes de-
veloped by Proctor and colleagues' (2009) (see Figure 1)
was used to frame the design of the HIV-STIC study as
well as to guide the development of relevant outcome
measures. The primary focus of the larger study was on
implementation outcomes at the staff or organizational
level of analysis (e.g., feasibility, acceptability, penetra-
tion) (see Figure 1). According to this model, achieving
success at the level of implementation outcomes should
trickle out to improvements in outcomes at the client
level (e.g., satisfaction) in the absence of direct client
interventions. As such, this paper examines the distal
client outcomes of the HIV-STIC study, specifically
whether the process improvement intervention involving
staff was related to the awareness and perceptions of
HIV services among their potential clients, that is, per-
sons detained in the participating correctional facilities
at the time of data collection. Our primary hypothesis is
that compared to the Control condition, inmates who
are incarcerated in facilities in the Experimental condi-
tion will express greater awareness of the HIV services
continuum at follow-up. Our secondary hypothesis is
that compared to the Control condition, inmates' per-
ceptions of and attitudes towards HIV and the provision
of HIV services in facilities in the Experimental condi-
tion will be greater at follow-up.
Methods/Design
Data collection and measures
The Anonymous Inmate Survey was administered by
locally trained research staff to groups of inmates, regard-
less of HIV serostatus (i.e., HIV serostatus was unknown
to researchers and inmates were not recruited based on
HIV serostatus), who were incarcerated at the time of data
collection. Research staff worked with the correctional
facility staff to schedule at date and time to administer the
Swan et al. Health and Justice (2015)3:11 Page 2 of 7
surveys. Facility staff then notified the inmates that they
could attend the group during that time to complete a
survey as part of a research study, and organized the logis-
tics for gathering the inmates in a group. There were no
inclusion or exclusion criteria aside from being incarcer-
ated at the time of the survey administration and consent-
ing to participate. In the group setting, the research staff
informed the inmates that their participation was volun-
tary, that they could choose which questions to complete
and/or leave the study at any time, and that not participat-
ing or only partially participating would not affect them,
their treatment, or their sentence, in any way. Inmates
were instructed that their answers on the survey were com-
pletely anonymous and told not to make any explicit identi-
fying marks on the survey. Those who remained were told
that by doing so, they were consenting to participate in the
study. These study procedures were approved by university
institutional review boards (IRB) for the research centers in
the study and in many cases by an additional IRB with jur-
isdiction over the correctional and other agencies that were
the research sites for the current study.
With the exception of two research centers, pretest
surveys were administered to a convenience sample of
inmates incarcerated in the experimental and control
study sites within one month of randomization (i.e., pre-
test). Due to logistical delays in initiating the study at
participating sites, staff at two research centers adminis-
tered the surveys at 4 and 8 months after randomization,
respectively. In both cases, surveys were administered
prior to implementing the change teams. Posttest sur-
veys were administered to another convenience sample
of inmates incarcerated in the experimental and control
study sites between two and six months after completion
of the implementation phase of the study.
The inmate survey included 21 items focused on eli-
citing yes/no and Likert scale responses from each
participant. A final question asked whether they would
like to make any additional comments or observations,
and if so, to write them in the space provided. (An add-
itional file provides a copy of the questions asked on the
survey [see Additional file 1]). To test the first hypoth-
esis, we created an HIV services awareness index (range
0Â­4) by summing the responses to the four questions in-
quiring about participants' awareness of the availability of
any of the HIV care continuum services (i.e., HIV educa-
tion and prevention, HIV testing, HIV medication, and
pre-release planning services for HIV infected inmates) in
the correctional facility where they were incarcerated at
the time of survey administration.
To test our second hypothesis, we used three compos-
ite scales that were identified through principal axis fac-
tor analysis of twelve items asking inmates to rate the
ease of using as well as how they felt about each of the
HIV care continuum service components at their facility
using a five point Likert scale (1Â­5). Staff Impact mea-
sured inmate perceptions of the medical, treatment, and
correctional staffs' support for HIV continuum of care on
four items like "the medical staff at this institution does a
good job of supporting HIV services and this institution is
doing everything it can to stop the spread of HIV". The
second scale, Medication/Pre-release Planning, included
two items: "how much [do] you believe inmates who have
HIV could benefit from receiving HIV medication while
incarcerated" and "how much [do] you believe inmates
who have HIV could benefit from receiving pre-release
planning services". The final scale, HIV Education and
Prevention/HIV Testing, was composed of four items re-
lated to perceptions towards these services, such as "how
do you feel about HIV education and prevention classes in
this institution" and "how easy would it be for you to get
tested for HIV at this institution". The internal consistency
reliability for the three scales ranged from good ( = .90)

to adequate ( = .68). Because we are unaware of any other
surveys of inmate awareness and perceptions of the HIV
Services continuum, we conducted psychometric analyses,
the results of which are available from the corresponding
author of this study.
Another summative composite (range 0Â­3) reflected
whether the inmate would consider accessing HIV edu-
cation and prevention and/or HIV testing. A final item
asked them to rate their current level of concern about
getting infected with HIV with responses ranging from 1
(Not at all) to 5 (Very Concerned).
Analytic plan
Because it was unknown whether the surveys were com-
pleted by different inmates at each time point (due to the
anonymity of respondents), a within-subjects analysis such
as repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
could not be calculated with confidence. Instead, a
series of one-way ANOVAs were first conducted to
compare the experimental and control conditions on
pretest measures of awareness, perceptions, willingness
to be tested for HIV or to attend HIV prevention and
education, and concern about becoming infected. A sec-
ond set of one-way ANOVAs compared the experimen-
tal and control groups on posttest measures of the same
set of variables. Cohen's d statistic was used to calculate
effect size, with .2 generally considered a small effect
size, .5 a medium effect size, and .8 a large effect size.
Sample
Seven of the nine HIV-STIC research centers collected
data from 2,301 inmates for the current study: 1253 in-
mates for the pre-intervention and 1048 post-intervention
surveys. Two research centers did not administer the An-
onymous Inmate Survey due to logistical issues in obtain-
ing permission from either the IRB or the correctional
facility administrators to survey the inmates. One research
center did not collect the post-intervention inmate survey
due to logistical issues in obtaining permission from the
correctional facility to survey the inmates. On average,
each research site contributed an average of 52 (range
9Â­97; SD = 20.7) pretest and 58 (range 27Â­112; SD = 22.9)
posttest surveys. The percentages of surveys contributed
by each research center are presented in Table 1.
As shown in Table 1, demographically, 11 percent of
the inmates were incarcerated in women's facilities.
More than two-thirds (66.9%) of the inmates were in-
carcerated in a prison and about half (55.3%) were in
correctional programs assigned to the experimental
study condition. Four of the institutions housed only
Spanish-speaking inmates. The Anonymous Inmate
Survey was translated into Spanish for these sites. The
prevalence of HIV in the state's correctional system
was taken from the Bureau of Justice Statistics report
summarizing HIV/AIDS prevalence in state correctional
facilities from 2008 until 2012 (Maruschak 2012). General
state prevalence estimates were from taken the website of
National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and
TB Prevention of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
(2015). Reflecting both the prevalence of HIV in correc-
tional facilities as well as the CDC rank of the HIV preva-
lence in the states, thirty-eight percent of surveys were
collected in "high prevalence" areas.
Results
Pretest and posttest comparisons
One-way ANOVAs on pre-intervention (pretest) aware-
ness and perceptions of HIV services showed that in-
mates who were incarcerated in control facilities scored
significantly higher on the HIV services awareness index,
with a medium effect size [F(1, 1250) = 28.43; p = .000;
Cohen's d = .30], and on their impressions of staff impact
with a small effect size [F(1, 1235) = 12.50; p = .000,
Cohen's d = .20], than inmates in facilities in the

experimental condition. Conversely, the experimental
group had significantly higher scores on the index of
whether they would consider using HIV prevention and
testing services, though the effect size was small [F(1,
1244) = 4.66; p = .031; Cohen's d = .12] (see Table 2). The
groups were not significantly different on the other
dependent variables at pretest.
One-way ANOVAs on post-intervention (posttest)
awareness and perceptions of HIV services showed only
one statistically significant difference: the inmates who
were incarcerated in experimental facilities were signifi-
cantly more concerned about contracting HIV, though
the effect size for this difference was small [F(1, 1032) =
9.30; p = .002; Cohen's d = .19]. No other comparisons
were statistically significant.a
Discussion
The comparison of the one-way ANOVA findings for
pretest and posttest awareness of HIV services revealed
that the differences observed on the pretest (i.e., the
control group showed a greater awareness of HIV services
and more positive evaluations of staff impact; the experi-
mental group reported being more likely to consider using
HIV services) did not exist at posttest. Although these
findings do not reflect a direct change since the groups of
inmates who were surveyed at posttest likely were not the
same inmates who filled out the surveys at pretest, they
do suggest that the change team intervention helped close
the significant gaps identified between experimental and
control groups on these key variables. Specifically, the
awareness of HIV services was higher in the experimental
condition at posttest than it was a pretest, and the aware-
ness was no longer significantly lower than the control
group, thus providing some support for our first hypoth-
esis. The same holds true for the findings on staff impact,
lending some support for our second hypothesis.
Collectively, these findings suggest facilities at least an
indirect effect of the change team intervention on
improvement in HIV services along the care continuum
since inmates in the experimental condition at posttest
"closed-the-gap" on differences observed on pretest
awareness and perceptions of staff impact, with differ-
ences on these scores no longer significant at posttest.
Finally, concern about becoming infected with HIV
among inmates incarcerated in facilities in the experi-
mental facilities at posttest was significantly higher than
among inmates in the control facilities, which also sug-
gests a distal effect of the HIV-STIC intervention to im-
prove the continuum of HIV services.
Although these results only lend indirect support for
the effectiveness of the local change team model, they
should be interpreted within the context of the larger
HIV-STIC study findings and per the model of imple-
mentation outcomes that framed this study and analysis
(see Figure 1). Pearson and colleagues (2014) report the
finding from the larger study that the local change team
approach significantly improved the actual delivery of
HIV services to incarcerated individuals. Our finding
that the distance between the baseline differences in
control and experimental samples in inmate awareness
of HIV services is consistent with this implementation
outcome of the larger study. The gap between the control
and experimental groups' perceptions of staff impact at
baseline also narrows in the current analysis. This finding
supports another main study outcome, published by
Visher et al. (2014), which showed improvements in staff
perception of the feasibility and acceptability of HIV ser-
vices as a result of the local change team process.
Limitations
In spite of the study's large multi-site sample and its
focus on an understudied area of HIV services research,
several limitations must be considered when interpreting
these findings. First, sample design was not random and
the results may not be generalizable to the population in
prison at the time of each data collection period. Second,

Therefore, interpretation of mean differences with associated significance levels above this are at a significantly increased risk for Type 1 error.

HIV serostatus or risk for infection of those who chose
to participate was unknown and it is possible that in-
mates with a greater concern about the need for HIV
services were more likely to answer the study questions.
We were also unable to assess study respondents longi-
tudinally. The anonymous survey precluded identifying
the respondent at baseline to enable administering the
post-test measure. Future implementation research stud-
ies should explore whether these distal outcomes are
replicated using repeated measures in representative
samples of the population. Studies should also explore
factors that could modify these findings, such as whether
the facilities housed males or females and whether the
facility was a jail or prison, analysis that could not be
undertaken in this study due to sample size limitations.
Another limitation in the current study was response
factors that were beyond the control of the researchers
in terms of survey administration at sites. Two of the re-
search centers with correctional facilities in the study
did not administer the anonymous inmate survey ques-
tionnaire to inmates in their facility at baseline or
follow-up, and an additional research center adminis-
tered it at baseline only, due to resistance from the In-
stitutional Review Board (IRB) or the correctional
facilities administration.
Conclusion
Comparisons between experimental and control condi-
tions on two independent survey administrations of
items related to perceptions of HIV care continuum ser-
vices showed that inmates in the two conditions were
initially different on three variables: 1) number of HIV
services they were aware of, 2) perceptions of staff im-
pact, and 3) willingness to seek HIV prevention and edu-
cation or testing services. However, at posttest, only one
significant difference was observed: the experimental
group reported significantly higher levels of concern
about contracting HIV. Collectively, these findings sug-
gest at least an indirect effect of the change team inter-
vention on improvement in HIV services along the care
continuum since inmates in the experimental condition
at posttest "closed-the-gap" on differences observed on
pretest awareness and perceptions of staff impact, with
differences on these scores no longer significant at post-
test. While we must be careful not to over-state the
causal effect of improvement of HIV services through
this model, the current findings interpreted in the con-
text of the larger study findings lend support for effect-
iveness of the local change team model on the actual
provision of HIV services, improved inmate awareness of
HIV services while incarcerated, and improvements in
staff and inmate attitudes towards HIV services in cor-
rectional settings.
