ABSTRACT
In EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis),
agonists of PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptors) provide clinical benefit and reduce damage. In
contrast with PPARc, agonists of PPARd are more effective
when given at later stages of EAE and increase myelin gene
expression, suggesting effects on OL (oligodendrocyte)
maturation. In the present study we examined effects of
the PPARd agonist GW0742 on OPCs (OL progenitor cells),
and tested whether the effects involve modulation of BMPs
(bone morphogenetic proteins). We show that effects of
GW0742 are mediated through PPARd since no ameliora-
tion of EAE clinical scores was observed in PPARd-null
mice. In OPCs derived from E13 mice (where E is embryonic
day), GW0742, but not the PPARc agonist pioglitazone,
increased the number of myelin-producing OLs. This was
due to activation of PPARd since process formation was
reduced in PPARd-null compared with wild-type OPCs. In
both OPCs and enriched astrocyte cultures, GW0742
increased noggin protein expression; however, noggin
mRNA was only increased in astrocytes. In contrast,
GW0742 reduced BMP2 and BMP4 mRNA levels in OPCs,
with lesser effects in astrocytes. These findings dem-
onstrate that PPARd plays a role in OPC maturation,
mediated, in part, by regulation of BMP and BMP
antagonists.

INTRODUCTION
Studies from our laboratory (Feinstein et al., 2002) and others
(Diab et al., 2002; Natarajan and Bright, 2002) have shown
that agonists of PPARc (peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor c) reduce clinical and histological symptoms in EAE
(experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis), an animal
model of MS (multiple sclerosis). These effects are due, in
part, to suppression of inflammatory gene expression (Drew
et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2007), inhibition of activated T-cell
proliferation and production of inflammatory mediators
(Feinstein, 2003; Kielian and Drew, 2003), and reduction of
leucocyte infiltration into the CNS (central nervous system)
(Klotz et al., 2007). These findings have led to the design of
small clinical trials in relapsing remitting MS patients (Miller
et al., 2005; Kaiser et al., 2009) with encouraging results.
Similarly, agonists of PPARa show anti-inflammatory actions
on glial cells (Deplanque et al., 2003; Xu et al., 2005, 2006)
and benefit in EAE (Lovett-Racke et al., 2004; Dasgupta et al.,
2007; Xu et al., 2007).
In contrast with PPARa and PPARc, studies of the PPARd
(also referred to as PPARb or PPARb/d) isoform in EAE are

limited. PPARd is expressed throughout the body in most
tissues and is the most abundant PPAR in brain (Michalik
et al., 2003). The knowledge that activation of PPARd
regulates lipid metabolism (Basu-Modak et al., 1999;
Kliewer et al., 2001; Rosenberger et al., 2002), raised the
possibility that PPARs might regulate lipid metabolism in OLs
(oligodendrocytes). Studies from the Skoff laboratory
(Granneman et al., 1998) have shown that PPARd is the
major PPAR isotype expressed in optic and sciatic nerve, and
is mainly expressed in the OL population. A subsequent study
(Saluja et al., 2001) confirmed that PPARd, but not PPARc,
selective agonists increased OL differentiation, including
increasing MBP (myelin basic protein) and PLP (proteolipid
protein) protein and mRNA levels.
Based on the above findings, we previously tested whether
PPARd agonists could provide protection in EAE (Polak et al.,
2005). We found that, in contrast with PPARa and PPARc
agonists, treatment with a PPARd agonist did not signifi-
cantly reduce disease severity during the early stages of EAE,
but instead showed benefit when given at the peak of
disease. This was accompanied by reductions in the
appearance of cortical lesions, neuronal damage and glial
inflammation. Moreover, in contrast with PPARc agonists, the
selective PPARd agonist GW0742 did not suppress pro-
inflammatory cytokine production from T-cells, which may
account for its reduced efficacy to influence early stages of
EAE. GW0742 also caused an increase in myelin gene
expression in EAE brains, suggesting a distinct mechanism
of action possibly involving effects on OL maturation or
survival.
Among the many factors implicated in OPC (OL progenitor
cell) maturation are members of the BMP (bone morphoge-
netic protein) family. BMPs were originally identified as
extracellular factors able to induce bone formation, but were
later shown to be expressed in other tissues and play a role in
development of other organs, including the nervous system
(Goumans and Mummery, 2000; ten Dijke et al., 2003). BMPs
belong to the TGF (transforming growth factor) superfamily
which, upon binding to their cognate receptors, activate
phosphorylation of Smad proteins, which in turn bind to
specific promoter elements and regulate gene transcription. A
key gene target of BMP signalling are Id (inhibitors of
differentiation) proteins similar in structure to bHLH (basic
helix-loop-helix) transcription factors, but lacking the DNA-
binding domain (Miyazono and Miyazawa, 2002). Id proteins
can therefore form heterodimers with other bHLH proteins,
but the resulting complex is inactive. Both BMPs and their
cognate receptors have been shown to be expressed by OLs
during normal development (Cheng et al., 2007; See and
Grinspan, 2009).
BMP signalling is regulated by interactions with a class of
molecules referred to collectively as BMP antagonists
(Yanagita, 2005) which function primarily by direct asso-
ciation with BMPs, thereby preventing binding to BMP
receptors. BMP signalling has been shown to play a role in
OL maturation and survival, since treatment with BMP
antagonists promotes OL maturation (Mehler et al., 1997;
Mabie et al., 1999; Mehler et al., 2000; Mekki-Dauriac et al.,
2002), and the BMP antagonist noggin induced oligoden-
drogenesis in human embryonic stem cells (Izrael et al., 2007).
The ability of BMPs to reduce OL maturation is due in large
part to formation of complexes between Id proteins and the
bHLH proteins Olig1 (OL transcription factor 1) and Olig2
which have been well characterized for their involvement in
OL maturation (Cheng et al., 2007; Bilican et al., 2008). Given
the importance of this signalling system in OL maturation,
and in view of the fact that GW0742 increased myelin
expression, we hypothesized that the effects of PPARd
agonists could involve modulation of the BMP signalling
system.
In the present study we have used PPARd-null mice to
show that the beneficial effects of GW0742 in EAE are
dependent upon the presence of functional PPARd, and that
PPARd plays a role in regulating the normal processes of OL
maturation. We also demonstrate that the effects of PPARd
involve regulation of BMP and BMP antagonist expression in
OPCs and astrocytes. Taken together these findings support
the concept that PPARd plays an important role in the normal
maturation of OPCs, and suggest that PPARd agonists provide
benefit in EAE by accelerating OPC maturation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Animals
Female C57BL/6 mice, aged 6­8 weeks, were from Charles
River Breeding. PPARd-null mice were generated as prev-
iously described (Peters et al., 2000). Pregnant Sprague­
Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Breeding, and
used to provide P1 (where P is post-natal day) pups. Mice
were maintained in a controlled 12 h:12 h light/dark environ-
ment and provided food ad libitum. All experiments were
approved by the local IACUC (Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee).
Cell culture
Enriched cultures of primary mouse or rat astrocytes were
prepared from P1 pups using procedures described previously,
including complete change of media [DMEM (Dulbecco's
modified Eagle's medium) containing 10% fetal calf serum
and antibiotics] every 3 days (Dello Russo et al., 2003). The
cells reached confluency after 7­8 days. At that time the cells
were shaken for 2 h to remove adhering microglia, and
overnight at 225 rev./min at 37°C to dislodge OPCs. The
remaining cells are approximately 95% astrocytes by staining
for the astrocyte-specific protein GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic
protein), and 5% adherent microglia.

OPCs were prepared from E13 (where E is embryonic day)
mouse pups using a recently described method (Pedraza et al.,
2008). In brief, E13 embryos were removed, and then washed in
cold PBS; the cerebellum was removed and meninges dissected
away. The tissue from six to eight brains was triturated by 40
passages through a 1 ml pipette tip in DMEM/F12 and B27
neuronal supplement, and then filtered through a 70 mm-pore-
size cell strainer. The cells were plated at the equivalent of two
brains per T25 flask in 8 ml of NPM (neural proliferation medium)
containing DMEM/F12/B27 neuronal supplement and 10 ng/ml
EGF (epidermal growth factor; Sigma). The cells were passaged
every 3 days by trituration and plated at a 1:5 ratio in NPM. After
two passages, the cells were mechanically dissociated with a 1 ml
pipette, then plated on to PDL (poly-D-lysine)-coated coverslips
in NPM supplemented with 10 ng/ml bFGF (basic fibroblast
growth factor) and 10 ng/ml PDGFa (platelet-derived growth
factor a) [this is ODM (OL differentiation medium)].
For the data shown in Figure 2, cells were grown for 48 h
on PDL-coated coverslips in ODM, the medium was then
changed, and cells grown for a further 5 days in Sato­
Bottenstein media in the absence of bFGF/PDGF, but
containing 30 nM T3 and 10 mM AraC to reduce astrocyte
proliferation, and either 10 mM of the PPARc agonist
pioglitazone, 10 mM of the PPARd agonist GW0742, or the
equivalent amount of DMSO vehicle to determine whether
these drugs would induce further OPC maturation.
Induction of EAE
EAE was actively induced in 6­8-week-old mice using synthetic
MOG35­55
(myelin OL glycoprotein peptide 35­55) as described
previously (Feinstein et al., 2002). The MOG35­55
peptide
(MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK) was purchased from Anaspec.
Mice were injected subcutaneously (two 100 ml injections into
adjacent areas in one hind limb) with an emulsion of 300 mg
of MOG35­55
dissolved in 100 ml of PBS, mixed with 100 ml
of complete Freund's adjuvant containing 500 mg of Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (Difco). Immediately after MOG35­55
injection, the animals received an i.p. (intraperitoneal) injection
of 200 ng of PT (pertussis toxin; List Biochemicals) in 200 ml of
PBS. At 2 days later, the mice received a second PT injection, and
1 week later they received a booster injection of MOG35­55
.
Clinical assessment of EAE
Clinical signs were scored on a 5 point scale: grade 0, no clinical
signs; 1, limp tail; 2, impaired righting; 3, paresis of one hind
limb; 4, paresis of two hind limbs; 5, death. Scoring was
performed at the same time each day by a blinded investigator.
Treatment of mice with PPARd agonist
The selective PPARd agonist GW0742 {4-[2-(3-fluoro-4-tri-
fluoromethylphenyl)-4-methylthiazol-5-ylmethylsulfanyl]- 2-
methylphenoxy)-acetic acid} was synthesized at
GlaxoSmithKline as described previously (Sznaidman et al.,
2003) and was provided by Dr Tim Willson (GlaxoSmithKline,
Raleigh, NC, U.S.A.). Chow containing 100 p.p.m. GW0742 was
prepared by Research Diets by mixing 100 mg of drug with
1 kg of Purina mouse chow 5001. Mice were provided free access
to chow, and on average consumed 2 g per mouse per day, giving
an average daily dose of 10 mg of GW0742/kg. This dose is similar
to that previously use by our group and others for studies of
other PPAR agonists in EAE models (Feinstein et al., 2002).
mRNA analysis
Total RNA from cells and tissues was isolated using TRIzolH
reagent (Invitrogen/Gibco); aliquots were converted into cDNA
using random hexamer primers, and mRNA levels estimated by
qPCR (quantitative PCR). PCR conditions were 35 cycles of
denaturation at 94°C for 10 s, annealing at 58­64°C for 15 s
and extension at 72°C for 20 s on a Corbett Rotorgene real-
time PCR unit. PCR was performed using Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen), and contained SYBR Green (SybrGreen1 100006
concentrate, diluted 1:10000; Molecular Probes). Relative
mRNA concentrations were calculated from takeoff point of
reactions using the software provided by the manufacturer,
and normalized to a-tubulin and GDH (glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase) measured in the same samples.
Melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis ensured
production of single and correct sized products. Primers were
derived from published sequence information using Perl Primer
software (perlprimer.sourceforge.net) to generate PCR pro-
ducts ranging from 100 to 250 bp. The primers used were: GDH

Immunocytochemical staining
E13 OPCs were grown on PDL-coated coverslips, treated and
prepared for staining. Coverslips were then rinsed in PBS,
fixed with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) for 10 min, rinsed in
PBS, incubated with mouse anti-MBP (1:200; Chemicon),
goat anti-noggin (1:40; R&D Systems), rabbit anti-PLP (1:300;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-GFAP (1:500; Dako) or
rabbit anti-PDGFRa (1:300; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
diluted in 1% donkey serum/PBS, overnight at 4°C. Cells
were rinsed in PBS, incubated with anti-rabbit-TRITC
(tetramethylrhodamine b-isothiocyanate, 1:200; Southern
Biotechnology) and anti-mouse-FITC (1:200; Sigma) for 2 h
at 37°C, rinsed in PBS, incubated with DAPI (at 1:500) in PBS
for 10 min, rinsed in PBS, and then mounted on coverslips.
Data analysis
Quantification of the cell numbers in Figure 2 was performed
manually, and in Figures 4 and 6 performed using Zeiss
Axiovision version 4.5. Comparisons between groups were made
using a Student's unpaired t test. Comparisons of the number of
stained cells in Figure 2 was done using x2 analysis. Comparison
of clinical signs in WT (wild-type) compared with PPARd-null
mice was performed by two-way repeated measures ANOVA
using data from day 25 (the start of treatment) to the end of the
study (day 49). Values are means¡S.E.M., and for all
comparisons significance was taken at P,0.05.
RESULTS
PPARd mediates protective effects of GW0742
We have previously shown that treatment of C57BL/6 mice
with the PPARd agonist GW0742 ameliorated clinical and
histological signs of EAE when administered to mice with
moderate disease severity (Polak et al., 2005). To confirm that
these effects were mediated via activation of PPARd, and not
by off-target actions of the agonist, we tested whether
GW0742 influenced the course of disease in PPARd-null mice
in which endogenous PPARd is inactivated in all cells and
tissues by insertion of the neomycin gene into the DNA-
binding domain. As previously observed, providing GW0742
to WT mice at 25 days after immunization (at which time they
show moderate clinical signs) significantly reduced clinical
signs beginning approx. 15 days later (Figure 1A).
Immunization of PPARd-null mice with MOG peptide resulted
in a similar disease incidence and severity as WT mice,
suggesting that PPARd does not play a significant role in the
early stages of EAE. However, in contrast with the WT mice,
treatment with GW0742 did not effect disease progression
for up to 25 days of treatment (Figure 1B). This provides
strong evidence that the effects of GW0742 are mediated
through this receptor and are not due to off-target actions.
Since the receptor is inactivated in all cells throughout the
body, these results do not allow us to conclude whether the
loss of GW0742 benefit is due to lack of PPARd from brain, or
from some other tissue; however, our previous studies did not
reveal any effect of GW0742 on splenic T-cells, suggesting
that lack of PPARd from brain may account for the current
findings.
Effects of GW0742 on OPC maturation
We hypothesized that GW0742 could provide benefit in EAE
involving effects on OL maturation or survival. To address
this, we first tested whether GW0742 influenced maturation
of OPCs generated from E13 mice. These preparations are
grown as neurospheres, then grown on PDL-coated plates in
medium containing bFGF and PDGF which leads to differ-
entiation (Pedraza et al., 2008). After 7 days growth on PDL-
coated slides, OPCs show little staining for MBP (Figure 2A)
Figure 1 GW0742 does not reduce EAE symptoms in PPARd-null mice
C57Bl/6 control mice (A) and PPARd-null (B) mice were immunized with MOG35­55
peptide and clinical scores monitored to 50 days.
On day 25 the mice were split into two subgroups having comparable disease progression (the two subgroups are indicated by the
open and closed circles) and were provided free access to chow containing 0, control (#) or 100 p.p.m. GW0742 ($). Values are
means¡S.E.M. of clinical scores. The incidence of disease reached 100% in all groups by day 14; there was no difference in the
average day of onset (9.3¡0.4 compared with 10.8¡0.9, null compared with WT; means¡S.E.M.). In the WT mice, there was a
statistically significant effect of GW0742 on clinical scores over time (two-way repeated measures ANOVA of day 25­49 scores,
F[14,1]5 2.75, P50.0012). Cont, control.

and the presence of numerous GFAP+-stained cells. After 5
days growth in GW0742, the number of GFAP-stained cells
was significantly increased from 13% (in vehicle-treated
cultures) to 26% (P,0.0001, as measured using a x2 test);
and their morphology more closely resembled that of mature
astrocytes. In these cultures we also observed an increased
number of cells stained for MBP, which increased from none
in vehicle-treated cultures to 4% in the treated cultures
(P,0.0001, as measured using a x2 test), as well as the
appearance of myelin sheaths and longer processes
(Figure 2B). Treatment with the PPARc agonist pioglitazone
did not significantly increase the number of GFAP+-stained
cells (16% of all cells, P.0.05 compared with vehicle),
although they again showed a more mature phenotype; very
few cells (0.5% of all cells, P50.07) showed positive staining
for MBP (Figure 2C).
To look at the initial events involved in the effects of
GW0742 on OPC maturation, we measured mRNA levels of
known markers of OPC maturation (Figure 3). After treatment
of E13 OPCs with 3 mM GW0742 for 24 h, there was a
significant increase in expression of Olig1, CGT, PDGFRa and
an increase in GalC compared with vehicle-treated cells
(Figures 3A­3D). However, at this timepoint there was no
change in PLP mRNA levels (Figure 3E). Levels of PPARd were
also significantly increased by GW0742 (Figure 3F), as were
levels of the well-characterized PPARd target gene ANGPTL-4,
although interestingly, not of a second target gene UCP3
(Figures 3G and 3H).
Staining for the early OPC marker PDGFRa confirmed that
treatment with GW0742 for 24 h increased OPC maturation
as indicated by an increase in cell migration (Figure 4).
GW0742 did not modify the total number of spheres present;
however, the average size of the spheres was significantly
reduced (diameter of 40.7¡2.1 mm compared with 30.4¡1.6
mm, P,0.0005) (Figures 4A and 4B). At the same time, the
total number of cells that migrated out from the spheres was
significantly increased by GW0742 (814¡38 compared with
1135¡105 cells per field; DMSO compared with GW0742,
P,0.05) (Figures 4C and 4D), and those cells showed a
greater number of processes (Figures 4E and 4F).
PPARd mediates OPC maturation
To determine whether endogenous PPARd plays a role in normal
OL maturation, we prepared primary OPCs from E13 WT and
PPARd-null mice and examined process formation under full
differentiation conditions (e.g. medium containing PDGFa, bFGF
and B27 supplement). After 7 days, WT cells had more primary
processes than did PPARd-null cells (Figure 5A), and quantifica-
tion of process number (Figure 5B) revealed that PPARd-null
cells had significantly fewer processes per cell (2.3¡0.04) than
WT cells (3.1¡0.1). Analysis of process distribution (Figure 5C)
showed a left shift in the average number of processes per cell in
PPARd-null cells, suggesting that process maturation was not
completely inhibited, but either temporally delayed or limited to
fewer processes in the null cells.
GW0742 increases noggin expression
In view of reports that BMPs inhibit OL maturation (Gross
et al., 1996; Hardy and Friedrich, 1996; Zhu et al., 1999;
Mehler et al., 2000; Mekki-Dauriac et al., 2002; Gomes et al.,
2003), we hypothesized that GW0742 might act by increasing
BMP antagonist expression. Immunostaining of E13 OPCs
treated for 24 h with GW0742 showed staining for the BMP
antagonist noggin, primarily in the non-migrating cells which
remained within spheres (Figures 6A and 6B). Quantification
of cell numbers revealed no significant effect of treatment on
Figure 2 Effect of GW0742 on OPC maturation
Mouse E13 OPCs were plated on to PDL-coated coverslips, grown for 48 h in differentiation medium, medium replaced with Sato­
Bottenstein medium, and cells grown for a further 5 days in the absence of growth factors and in the presence of (A) vehicle, (B) 10
mM GW0742 or (C) 10 mM pioglitazone. Cells were fixed and stained for GFAP (TRITC, red), MBP (FITC, green) and nuclei [DAPI (49,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole), blue]. Images shown are representative fields of view from three or four slides examined per condition.
There was a significant increase in the number of GFAP+ cells from 130/993 (13.0%) in vehicle-treated, to 140/643 (25.5%) in
GW0742-treated cultures (P,0.0001, as measured using a x2 test), but not in the pioglitazone-treated cultures (119/742; 16.1%).
The number of MBP+ cells was significantly increased from none in the vehicle-treated to 20/643 (4.0%) in the GW0742-treated cells
(P,0.0001), but not in the pioglitazone-treated cultures (4/742; 0.5%).

the total number of spheres (20.4¡3 compared with
28.0¡5, average number of spheres per field, DMSO
compared with GW0742, P.0.05). However, the number of
noggin-stained spheres was significantly increased (from
7.4¡2 to 21.4¡4 per field, P,0.01). This increased number
of noggin-stained spheres reflects a significant increase from
40¡10% to 79¡6% (P,0.01) of all spheres. We did not
observe any significant co-localization of noggin with either
PDGFRa (Figures 7A and 7B), PLP (Figures 7C and 7D) or GFAP
(Figures 7E and 7F), suggesting that expression was restricted
to immature progenitor cells. Analysis by qPCR showed that,
after 24 h of treatment, GW0742 did not increase noggin
mRNA levels, although we did observe a significant decrease
in both BMP2 and BMP4 mRNA levels (Figure 8A).
Since there are some astrocytes present in the OPC cultures,
we tested whether GW0742 influenced BMP or BMP
antagonist expression in enriched astrocyte cultures. After 24
h we observed a significant increase of noggin mRNA levels in
astrocytes (Figure 8B); interestingly, this increase appeared to
be selective for noggin since mRNA levels of other BMP
antagonists (gremlin, follistatin and bambi) were not increased
(in fact gremlin mRNA levels were significantly reduced). In
contrast with OPCs, GW0742 did not increase PPARd mRNA
levels (Figure 9A). Interestingly, GW0742 caused a significant
increase in the PPARd target gene UCP3, but not in ANGPTL-4.
Consistent with the increase in noggin mRNA, we observed a
large increase in noggin staining, present in vesicular
structures around the nucleus of primary astrocytes treated
with 3 mM GW0742 for 24 h (Figure 10).
DISCUSSION
In the present study we show that PPARd is involved in the
regulation of OPC maturation and is associated with changes
in the expression of BMPs and BMP antagonists. We
previously have shown that treatment of EAE-immunized
mice with GW0742 did not offer significant protection when
administered early during disease evolution, but instead
reduced clinical signs when given to mice showing moderate
clinical signs (Polak et al., 2005). In those studies, GW0742 did
not suppress the ability of T-cells to produce IFNc (interferon
c), providing a possible explanation for its inability to reduce
early-stage EAE. In contrast, GW0742 significantly increased
PLP and MBP mRNA levels in EAE mice, suggesting possible
effects on OL maturation, survival or proliferation. The
findings of the present study support this possibility since, in
E13 OPCs, GW0742 induced maturation as determined by

increased myelin gene expression, increased myelin sheets
and increased numbers of pre-myelinating OPCs. The finding
that mRNA levels for PLP were not increased suggests that
GW0742 affects earlier stages of OPC maturation, although
whether PLP is increased at later times is not yet known.
Overall, these findings are in agreement with earlier results
showing that the weaker PPARd agonist bromopalmitate
(Granneman et al., 1998) and the more selective agonist L-
796449 (Saluja et al., 2001) induced myelin expression in
post-natal mouse OPC cultures. Furthermore, the results
that GW0742 was ineffective at reducing clinical signs in
PPARd-null mice confirms that the actions of this drug
depend upon PPARd and are not due to off-target effects as
has been reported for other PPAR agonists (Dello Russo et al.,
2003).
We examined the specificity of PPAR agonist effects by
comparing the actions of GW0742 with those of the selective
PPARc agonist pioglitazone on OPC maturation (Figure 2).
Increased MBP staining was seen primarily in the GW0742-
treated OPCs, suggesting a more important role for PPARd as
compared with PPARc in the OPC maturation process.
Interestingly, treatment with either GW0742 or pioglitazone
led to more mature astrocyte morphology in the GFAP-
positive-stained cells, suggesting that both PPARs may be

involved in astrocyte maturation. Our findings also show that
endogenous PPARd plays a role in OPC maturation, since in
PPARd-deficient OPCs the distribution and average number
of processes was significantly reduced compared with WT
OPCs. It should be noted that, despite the absence of PPARd,
these OPCs still developed processes and sheaths, but OPC
maturation was reduced, pointing to PPARd as a modulator
of the maturation process. PPARd may be considered as a
potential feed-forward factor along OPC maturation, even
though it is not yet clear at which step through the
maturation PPARd exerts its role.
We focused attention on the class of BMPs and BMP
antagonists for several reasons. Numerous studies have
shown a role for BMPs in regulating neural stem cell
commitment (Kondo and Raff, 2004; Gaughwin et al., 2006;
Hampton et al., 2007a; Talbott et al., 2006; Cheng et al.,
2007); and in restricting OPC maturation during normal
development (Gross et al., 1996; Hardy and Friedrich, 1996;
Zhu et al., 1999; Mehler et al., 2000; Mekki-Dauriac et al.,
2002; Gomes et al., 2003). This has been thought to be a
BMP-dependent induction of Id proteins that can bind to and
inactivate the bHLH proteins Olig1 and Olig2 (Samanta and
Kessler, 2004) which promote OPC maturation.
Recently, it was shown that in EAE, BMP4, -6 and -7 are
up-regulated in lumbar spinal cord; with BMP4 being the
most abundant mRNA detected, and being detected in
astrocytes as well as in oligodendrocytes and macrophages
(Ara et al., 2008). In a second related study, it was found that
BMP4 and BMP7 were increased following lysolecithin-
induced demyelination, and interestingly that phosphorylated
Smad 1/5/8 was detected in astrocytes (Fuller et al., 2007),
suggesting that BMPs can induce astrogliosis and inhibit
remyelination. Taken together, these findings raised the
possibility that treatments or interventions that increase BMP

number of spheres stained for noggin in seven fields of view for each condition taken at 206magnification. There was a
similar number of spheres in the two groups (20.4¡3 compared with 28.0¡5, average number of spheres per field, DMSO compared
with GW0742, P.0.05). GW0742 significantly increased the number of noggin-stained spheres (from 7.4¡2 to 21.4¡4 per field,
P,0.01) and the percentage of noggin-stained spheres increased from 40¡10% to 79¡6% (P,0.01). Representative images are

antagonist expression, or reduce BMP expression, would
facilitate OPC maturation. Several previous studies have
shown that PPAR agonists can influence BMP signalling. In
human umbilical vein endothelial cells, pioglitazone sup-
pressed BMP2 expression (Zhang et al., 2008), several PPARc
agonists decreased BMP2 expression in human osteoblasts
(Lin et al., 2007), and in mouse gonadotopinoma cells,
pioglitazone reduced BMP signalling including activation of
Id1 expression and DNA synthesis (Takeda et al., 2007). In the
present study we extend this list by demonstrating that a
PPARd agonist can decrease BMP2 and BMP4 expression in
OPCs, and to our knowledge this is the first demonstration of
any PPAR agonist increasing a BMP antagonist.
Our results point to distinct effects of GW0742 on BMPs
and their antagonists' in astrocytes and OPCs. In OPCs
GW0742 primarily affected expression of BMP2 and BMP4
mRNAs with lesser effects on the BMP antagonists; in
astrocytes the PPARd agonist had greater effects on
expression of the BMP antagonists noggin and gremlin, with
smaller effects on BMPs. The lack of significant changes in
BMP2 and BMP4 expression in GW0742-treated astrocytes,
together with down-regulation of the same BMPs in
GW0742-treated OPCs, suggests the possibility of an auto-
crine short-range effect of BMPs in astrocytes and OPCs. This
may be similar to the balance of interactions between BMPs
and their antagonists that occur in the optic nerve which
result in enhanced OPC maturation (Kondo and Raff, 2004).
This may guarantee cellular identity for astrocytes and
precursor cell identity for OPCs. On the other hand, increase
in noggin expression in astrocytes following GW0742

treatment could represent a modulatory mechanism of the
intercellular communication between astrocyte and OPCs,
and may suggest a PPARd-mediated role of astrocytes in OPC
maturation.
At the protein level we observed in both OPCs and
astrocytes that GW0742 treatment increased staining for
noggin protein, although the increase was more robust in the
primary astrocyte cultures. Whereas increased staining could
be due to an overall increase in noggin expression, the fact
that noggin is normally released raises the possibility that
GW0742 reduced release from astrocytes. If so, the absence
of strong intracellular noggin staining in the OPCs could be
due to increased release owing to GW0742, suggesting cell-
specific means of regulating release. The greater increase in
primary astrocyte cultures compared with the astrocytes
present in the OPC cultures could also be due to differences
in the maturation state of astrocytes, suggesting that only
more mature cells can highly express noggin.
Previous characterization of BMPs and BMP antagonists in
astrocytes is limited. In optic nerve astrocytes, the mRNAs for
gremlin, follistatin, chordin and bambi, but not noggin, were
detected (Wordinger et al., 2002); and noggin mRNA was
expressed in type 1 astrocytes in P6 rat optic nerve (Kondo
and Raff, 2004). Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated
that noggin was primarily expressed in astrocytes in the
dorsal spinal cord following rhizotomy, but was absent from
non-injured spinal cords (Hampton et al., 2007b).

Student's t test).

Astrocytes have been shown to express BMP4 in the adult
rat CNS (Mikawa et al., 2006), BMP4 and 7 primarily in
olfactory bulb astrocytes throughout development (Peretto
et al., 2002), and the mRNAs for BMP2, 4, 5 and 7 in cultured
adult optic head astrocytes (Wordinger et al., 2002). It has
also been shown that BMP2/4 is increased in ischaemic
astrocytes (Xin et al., 2006), and that the mRNA levels of
BMP4, but not BMP2, are increased in astrocytes after spinal
cord injury (Chen et al., 2005), suggesting regulation
following injury. These indications that BMP levels are
increased under pathological conditions are consistent with
our findings that a treatment to reduce pathology leads to a
reduction in astroglial BMP levels.
The findings in the present study that agonists of PPARd
can down-regulate the BMP signalling system may be of
particular relevance during diseases such as EAE since
inflammatory conditions have been shown to increase BMP
signalling. For example, in prostate cancer cells, NF-kB
(nuclear factor kB) binds to the BMP2 promoter and induces
BMP2 expression, and in chondrocytes, TNFa (tumour necrosis
factor a) induces BMP2 (Fukui et al., 2006), most probably by
also binding to the BMP2 promoter (Feng et al., 2003). It is
known that certain cytokines including TNFa and IFNc, which
are present in the EAE brain, cause reversible inhibition of
OPC proliferation and maturation (Agresti et al., 1996), and
that neurogenesis is sensitive to the inflammatory milieu
and that chronic inflammation can reduce neurogenesis
(Monje et al., 2003; Pluchino et al., 2008; Ekdahl et al., 2009;
Whitney et al., 2009). Therefore, in addition to direct effects
on BMPs and BMP antagonists, it is likely that PPARd down-
regulates BMP signalling by attenuating inflammatory
activation, as it has been shown to do in different cells and
tissues (Delerive et al., 1999; Planavila et al., 2005; Kilgore
and Billin, 2008; Smeets et al., 2008).
In summary, the results of the present study confirm that
PPARd mediates the effects of the synthetic agonist GW0742
in EAE and also plays a role in normal OPC maturation.
Treatment with GW0742 regulates both BMP, as well as BMP
antagonist, expression in astrocytes and OPCs, although with
distinct effects. The molecular mechanisms underlying the
ability of PPARd agonists to modulate BMP and BMP
antagonist regulation could involve both direct effects on
transcription via binding to PPAR-responsive elements, and
indirect effects due to anti-inflammatory actions which could
reduce inflammatory up-regulation of BMPs. The recent
demonstration that PPARc agonists can be protective in
relapsing/remitting MS patients (Kaiser et al., 2009), together
with the observations that PPARd agonists promote OPC
maturation, suggests that clinical trials of pure or mixed
PPAR agonists may be of therapeutic value in the treatment
of MS.
