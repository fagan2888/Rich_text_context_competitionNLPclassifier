Terror Management Theory
According to Terror Management Theory, people tend to
react to reminders of their own mortality and existential
threats by striving for self-preservation. Anxiety ensues at
the thought of death, and people feel a need to buffer against
that existential anxiety. One response is to cling to beliefs
that give meaning to life and provide a sense of security.
Reaffirming personal belief systems, including political and
religious beliefs, provides some anxiety relief (Solomon,
Greenberg, & Pyszczynski, 2004).
People with death anxiety, therefore, value their own cul-
tural worldview; they value the set of beliefs that give them
a sense of belonging and worth as a way of transcending
existential angst. In turn, people tend to value others with
similar beliefs when dealing with death anxiety. Ingroup
membership provides a feeling of belonging and validates
the shared worldview; as such, ingroup evaluation rises with
death anxiety. "Across different countries more than 350
studies have found that reminders of mortality increase such
responses as positive evaluations of those who validate the
participants' belief system and negative evaluation of those
who threaten it" (Niesta, Fritsche, & Jonas, 2008, p. 49).
Terror Management Theory therefore posits that people
tend to be more discriminatory toward those they perceive as
different from themselves, or as violating the values of their
worldview, when death is salient. When faced with the idea of
their own mortality, people seek to solidify their own cultural
worldview as a form of protection against feelings of anxiety
and terror. Individuals reward those who validate their own
belief system and reject those whom they deem to hold an
opposing worldview (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon,
Simon, & Breus, 1994; McGregor et al., 1998; Niesta et al.,
2008; Solomon et al., 2004). Targets for rejection may include
people of different races or religions as well as people who
have violated the law. For example, mortality salience has been
linked to legal judgments about prostitutes (Jonas et al., 2008;
Rosenblatt, Greenberg, Solomon, Pyszczynski, & Lyon, 1989),
jail sentencing (Greenberg, Schimel, Martens, Solomon, &
Pyszczynski, 2001), hate crimes (Lieberman,Arndt, Personius,
& Cook, 2001), armed robbery (Pickel & Brown, 2003), prop-
erty crimes, fraud, and negligence cases (Dechesne et al., 2003;
Florian & Mikulincer, 1997), among others.

Empathy, Social Dominance Orientation,
Mortality Salience, and Perceptions of a
Criminal Defendant
Donna Crawley1 and Richard Suarez1
Abstract
In two studies, participants completed measures of trait empathy and social dominance orientation, read a summary of a hit
and run trial, and provided reactions to the case. In Study 1, the three randomly assigned conditions included a prompt to
empathize with the victims, the empathy prompt with a mortality salience manipulation, and a control condition. Participants
high in trait empathy were harsher in their judgments of the defendant than were low empathy participants, particularly after
having read the mortality salience prompt. The results indicated that mortality salience had triggered personality differences.
Participants high in social dominance assigned harsher sentences across conditions. Study 2 involved the same paradigm, but
the prompts were presented on behalf of the defendant. Despite the pro-defendant slant, the pattern of results was similar
to Study 1. Differences by trait empathy were more apparent among participants experiencing mortality salience, and social
dominance was related to sentence choices. There were no indications in either study of mortality salience increasing bias
against defendants in general or increasing racial bias.

However, the exact effects of mortality salience regarding
legal decisions differ from study to study, as a function of the
nature of the case and experimental paradigm, the values and
personality traits of the perceivers, and the type of dependent
measure examined. For example,Arndt, Lieberman, Cook, and
Solomon (2005) reviewed a series of terror management stud-
ies involving legal judgments; an analysis of those 25 studies
indicated that in approximately 70%, participants experiencing
mortality salience were harsher in their judgments of criminal
or civil defendants. However, those effects were sometimes
mitigated by personality factors. Furthermore, in approxi-
mately 20% of the studies reviewed, mortality salience had no
effect or increased leniency. Finally, 10% of the studies exam-
ined racial effects, and judgments were harsher against defen-
dants of a different racial group as compared with ingroup
members. Thus, although most of the research found greater
bias against those who had violated the law in mortality salience
conditions, especially if they were of another racial group, that
finding was not true in all situations.
Jonas et al. (2008) argued that mortality salience increases
people's desires and proclivities to cling to their cultural
worldviews and values, but that the specific values salient in a
given situation differ based on what is primed in that situation.
For example, Jonas, Schimel, Greenberg, and Pyszczynski
(2002) found greater generosity toward personally valued
charities over neutral charities among participants in a mortal-
ity salience condition. In later research, Jonas et al. (2008)
demonstrated that mortality salience sometimes leads to
greater altruism toward others, even outgroup members, when
prosocial values are primed and the target is relevant to the
prime. For example, when a prosocial norm was experimen-
tally primed in participants, mortality salience resulted in a
greater tendency to help others, especially when the altruistic
targets were children (Jonas et al., 2008). Prosocial norms are
particularly strong when children are involved (cf. Penner,
Dovidio, Piliavin, & Schroeder, 2005). Thus, there appears to
be an interaction among factors that can result in greater help-
ing rather than greater discrimination under mortality salience
conditions.
Consistent with the findings of Jonas et al. (2008), there
may be cultural differences in reactions to mortality salience.
For people from Western cultures, mortality salience
increases adherence to an individualistic worldview, and a
personal defensive stance. Thus, unless primed with proso-
cial norms, those from Western cultures tend to value similar
others, and to show greater prejudice against different others
while in a death aware state. However, people from eastern
cultures hold a different type of worldview featuring a more
collectivist perspective. Ma-Kellams and Blascovich (2011)
demonstrated that mortality salience increased the tendency
of participants from eastern cultures to defend others and to
reaffirm a collective mentality.
Thus, although there are hundreds of studies supporting
the role of mortality salience in increasing adherence to per-
sonal and cultural values, the outcomes of specific mortality
salience conditions depends on many factors: The cultural
worldview held, the specific values within that worldview
that are primed at the time of response, and the relevance of
the attitudinal target to the primed values.
Terror Management and Justice
Disparities by Race
Racial disparities in treatment by the justice system are well-
documented. "African-Americans make up 13% of the gen-
eral US population, yet they constitute 28% of all arrests,
40% of all inmates held in prisons and jails, and 42% of the
population on death row" (Hartney & Vuong, 2009, p. 2).
Racial disparities have been documented with respect to
police contacts (Crutchfield, Skinner, Haggerty, McGlynn, &
Catalano, 2012), charge severity (Martin, 2014), and severity
of sanctions across decision points within the criminal jus-
tice system (Stolzenberg, D'Alessio, & Eitle, 2013). See
Kansal and Mauer (2005) and the report by the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU, 2014) on Racial Disparities in
Sentencing, submitted to the Inter-American Commission on
Human Rights for reviews of the literature on race and
sentencing.
Factors affecting racial disparities in treatment are numer-
ous, complex, and involve both overt and subtle forms of
discrimination. Under certain circumstances, mortality
salience may be one of the subtle contributing factors to
racial disparities in treatment within the criminal justice sys-
tem. As discussed above, when manipulated in research stud-
ies, mortality salience has been shown to increase bias
against criminal defendants, particularly outgroup defen-
dants. In actual criminal proceedings, the types of cases
likely to "naturally" invoke mortality salience within jurors,
attorneys, and the public are cases involving death, some of
which would be capital cases. Thus, cases in which death has
occurred could trigger mortality salience, adding to potential
racial biases in treatment.
If it were true that mortality salience increases the ten-
dency for individuals to judge criminal defendants harshly,
especially defendants from a racial group different than the
perceiver, then there are some specific patterns of racial dis-
parity that should appear. First, there should be greater racial
disparity within the criminal justice system in regions where
the racial composition of a jury is likely to be different than
a minority defendant. There is statistical evidence that this is
true. Within the United States, the states with the highest lev-
els of racial disparity in incarceration are among those with
the lowest levels of diversity within the state population. For
example, we compared the 10 states with the highest levels
of racial diversity and the 10 least diverse states, based on the
percentage of non-White, foreign-born, and mixed race pop-
ulations (Emerson, 2011). Racial disparity in incarceration in
2011 for the most diverse states was significantly less than
the disparity for the homogeneous states, based on data from
The Sentencing Project (2014). The mean 2011 Black:White
Crawley and Suarez 3
incarceration ratio for the 10 most diverse states was 5.87:1
(SD = 2.17) and the mean ratio for the homogeneous states
was 9.05:1 (SD = 2.87), t(17) = 2.70, p = .02. In comparison,
the mean Black:White population ratio in the diverse states
was .16:1 for 2010, and the population ratio for the homoge-
neous states was .05:1, based on U.S. census data. Thus, the
homogeneous states have proportionally more Black indi-
viduals incarcerated even though the proportion of Blacks in
the state population is lower. Furthermore, the relatively high
racial disparity in prison in these homogeneous states does
not appear to be due to overt racism in general within those
regions. For instance, we note that most diverse states in this
sample have more hate groups (M = 22.78) listed by the
Southern Poverty Law Center (2014) than the least diverse
states (M = 8.80).
Second, there should be significant racial disparity in
treatment in cases involving death. An examination of mur-
der cases and racial disparities in the death penalty would be
informative. Sorensen and Wallace (1999) found that Black
individuals accused of killing Whites were more likely to be
charged with first-degree murder by prosecutors, with the
possibility of the death penalty, than any other racial combi-
nation in murder cases. Furthermore, 97.5% of the chief
District Attorneys making decisions about whether or not to
pursue the death penalty in this time period were White in the
United States; only 1.2% were African American (Pokorak,
1998). This pattern of racial disparity in charging was sub-
stantiated more recently by Baldus, Grosso, Woodworth, and
Newell (2011) in their examination of military death penalty
cases.
With respect to sentencing, in 2002, the Supreme Court
ruled that within jurisdictions that have capital punishment,
defendants have the right to have a jury decide on eligibility
for a death sentence, rather than a judge alone (Ring v.
Arizona). Therefore, in death penalty cases, unlike other types
of cases, the jury plays a significant role in the sentencing.And
in death penalty cases, the jury is likely to be in a state of mor-
tality salience. Research indicates that racial disparity in sen-
tencing does increase as the severity of sentences increases.
Black defendants are more likely to receive the death penalty
in murder cases than are White defendants, controlling for
other relevant legal factors (ACLU, 2014; Baldus &
Woodworth, 2004; Baldus, Woodworth, Zuckerman, Weiner,
& Broffitt, 1998).
What of cases involving death that are not death penalty
cases? In these cases, judges decide the sentences rather than
the jury, often with state guidelines informing their deci-
sions. In her study of over 1,000 homicide cases in
Philadelphia, 98.8% of which did not involve the death pen-
alty, Auerhahn (2007) found that while race alone did not
predict sentences, it did interact with age and other charac-
teristics to increase sentence severity.
In contrast, the literature on racial disparities in sentenc-
ing across nonhomicide cases is mixed (Mitchell, Haw,
Pfeifer, & Meissner, 2005). Kramer and Steffensmeir (1993)
found race to be a small factor in sentencing across cases in
their review of the Pennsylvania courts. Auerhahn's (2007)
review of the literature indicates that most, but not all, stud-
ies of race and sentencing find harsher sentences for minority
defendants across crime categories. Yet, data on weapons
offenses do not show racial disparities in sentencing (Hartney
& Vuong, 2009). Data presented by the ACLU (2014) and
Hartney and Vuong (2009) indicate that racial disparities in
sentencing appear to be the greatest for drug offenses.
Based on the pattern of findings cited above, mortality
salience may be one of the factors affecting judgments by
prosecutors, judges, and juries in death related cases, and
thus merits study. Racial bias in death penalty cases is clear,
for example, and racial disparity in incarceration is more
common in regions which are overwhelmingly White.
However, racial disparities within the criminal justice system
appear to be prevalent in a wide variety of cases, not just
those involving death. Thus, mortality salience is but one of
many factors leading to potential biases in criminal justice
cases.
Furthermore, past research has documented that the effects
of mortality salience depend on situational primes and indi-
vidual differences in personal values (cf. Arndt et al., 2005).
If indeed mortality salience leads to a reaffirmation of per-
sonal belief systems as a way of relieving anxiety (Solomon
et al., 2004), then individual value systems moderate the
effect of mortality salience on judgments of others, including
criminal defendants. For example, two personality traits that
have been linked to judgments of criminal defendants, and
which may interact with mortality salience, are empathy and
social dominance orientation.
Individual Differences Affecting
Perceptions of Criminal Defendants
Empathy
Empathy has been defined in various ways by different
researchers. Mehrabian and Epstein (1972) discussed two
types of empathy: cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.
Cognitive empathy involves understanding another's reac-
tions and feelings, while emotional empathy is a shared emo-
tional response to what another is experiencing. Mehrabian
and Epstein designed a measure of emotional empathy, and
during validation found that this measure correlated nega-
tively with aggression toward another, and positively with
altruistic behavior. People scoring high in empathy tended to
be less aggressive and more helpful to others.
Similar to the definition of emotional empathy above,
Hoffman (1987) has defined empathy as "an affective
response more appropriate to someone else's situation than to
one's own" (p. 48). He also discussed the role of empathy in
the perception of justice. Empathy toward the victim of a per-
ceived offense is particularly strong if a person can readily
identify with the victim and the victim's actions at the time of
4 SAGE Open
the crime (cf. Sundby, 2003). In addition to expressed support
for such a victim, Hoffman described the development of
empathic anger, a process by which environmental cues divert
a perceiver's empathic attention from a victim, and turn that
attention into empathic anger at the culprit responsible for
harm to the victim. Rather than focus emotion on the victim,
the emotional reaction becomes focused on the offender in
the situation. Within a legal case involving victim harm,
therefore, empathy with the victim may be exhibited in terms
of harsh judgments against a defendant.
In contrast, it is also possible to induce empathy for a
defendant, depending on the type of offense and characteris-
tics of the defendant. Such empathy should result in more
lenient judgments against the defendant. These effects have
been demonstrated in research by Plumm and Terrance
(2009) with a simulated domestic violence trial, and with a
patricide mock trial in research by Haegerich and Bottoms
(2000). In both cases, manipulations of mock juror empathy
affected perceptions of the defendant.
In addition, empathy has been found to interact with mor-
tality salience in affecting perceptions of offenders. Schimel,
Wohl, and Williams (2006) demonstrated that overall people
are more likely to forgive an ingroup member for an aggres-
sive act than an outgroup member when in a mortality
salience condition. However, people high in trait empathy
were equally likely to forgive an outgroup offender as an
ingroup offender. Those low in empathy were only forgiving
of the ingroup offender. Thus, there was an interaction
between empathy and mortality salience in perceptions of an
outgroup offender. Schimel et al. argued that to people high
in empathy, exhibiting a sympathetic reaction is a value
within their worldview and thus the tendency to be forgiving
was heightened by mortality salience with respect to both
ingroup and outgroup offenders. It is important to note that in
their study, the empathic focus was on a male adult offender,
the same gender and age as the person injured.
Social Dominance Orientation
Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, and Malle (1994) have defined
social dominance orientation as "one's degree of preference
for inequality among social groups" (p. 741). Past research-
ers have found respondents scoring high in social dominance
orientation to endorse conservative and nationalistic political
ideologies (Passini & Villano, 2013; Pratto et al., 1994),
existing status hierarchies and stereotypes (Tausch &
Hewstone, 2010), military actions (Cohrs, Moschner, Maes,
& Kielmann, 2005; Dunwoody, Plane, Trescher, & Rice,
2014; Pratto et al., 1994), and various forms of prejudice
(Bäckström & Björklund, 2007; Cohrs, Kämpfe-Hargrave,
& Riemann, 2012; Gatto & Dambrun, 2012; Kteily, Sidanius,
& Levin, 2011; Whitley, 1999). In Pratto et al.'s work, social
dominance was negatively related to support for women's
rights, social programs, and gay and lesbian rights. In addi-
tion, social dominance was found to be negatively related to
empathy and tolerance (Bäckström & Björklund, 2007;
Pratto et al., 1994; Sidanius et al., 2013).
In examining the interplay between social dominance ori-
entation and mortality salience, Bassett (2010) found that
participants who were high in social dominance were more
negative toward illegal immigrants in a mortality salience
condition, but not in a control condition. There was no main
effect for mortality salience on attitudes toward illegal immi-
grants in Bassett's findings, only an interaction between
social dominance orientation and mortality salience on atti-
tudes. Similarly, Crawley, Bacs, Nascimento, and Pavon
(2014) found that social dominance orientation was related
to racial bias in the perceived guilt of a suspect in a fictional
stabbing case in a mortality salience condition, but not in a
control condition.
Based on all of the research described above, it appears
that mortality salience elicits anxiety and people attempt to
alleviate that distress via adherence to their personal values
and by embracing beliefs and others that are familiar.
Individual personality traits, such as empathy and social
dominance orientation, reflect those personal values and thus
shape the specific effects of mortality salience. Finally, situ-
ational prompts also play a role in the form and strength with
which those personal values are manifested. We designed the
present research to further investigate these relationships.
The focus of the present studies was on the impact of mortal-
ity salience, empathy, social dominance orientation, and race
on reactions toward a criminal defendant, specifically in a hit
and run case.
The target of the dependent measures in these studies was
the defendant; the victims of the crime were children.
Therefore, attitudes toward the defendant may be shaped in
part by values evoked by reading about injured children. The
case presented to participants in a trial summary was based
on a real incident and part of the trial description was taken
from an online news account of the actual trial to increase the
realism of the experimental materials. Although some details
were changed, including the names, ages, ethnicities, and
location of the incident, the summary was very similar to
what a person reading the news might encounter.
We designed this research to examine mortality salience in
the context of an ambiguous criminal case, rather than a case
in which the evidence was overwhelming. Past research has
indicated that the strength of presented evidence is a signifi-
cant predictor of case judgments (cf. Devine, Clayton,
Dunford, Seying, & Pryce, 2001) such that biases tend to show
up more in ambiguous cases. The hit and run case selected was
not clear cut; the evidence was open to interpretation.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Mortality salience increases percep-
tions of culpability for criminal suspects because, for
many people, criminals disrupt an ordered worldview.
This is particularly true when the victims of a crime are
children because the normative value of protecting chil-
dren is also salient.
Crawley and Suarez 5
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Mortality salience increases bias
against criminal suspects from different racial groups, at
least among participants from Western cultures.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Empathy impacts judgments of crim-
inal suspects alone and in interaction with mortality
salience.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Social dominance impacts judgments
of criminal suspects alone and in interaction with mortal-
ity salience.
Study 1 Method
Participants
Four hundred and thirty-three adults completed an online
study, 234 female, 196 males, three not indicating gender.
The racial diversity in the sample by self-identification was
65.36% White, 15.70% Asian, 6.24% as Black, 7.16% as
Latino/Hispanic, and 5.54% as either another racial group or
multiracial. The mean age was age was 31.33 (SD = 11.86),
with a range from 18 to 75. Participants were solicited via
mturk and a participant pool at a public college in the north-
eastern United States.
Materials and Procedure
An online survey included the following components: a
consent statement with a warning not to participate if the
participant was at all depressed or would be discomforted
by reading about a violent crime, a 33-item Empathy Scale
(Mehrabian & Epstein, 1972), a 14-item Social Dominance
Orientation Scale (Pratto et al., 1994), 11 items about expe-
riences with the criminal justice system, and the presenta-
tion of a trial summary for an alleged felony hit and run
case. Four dependent measures followed the trial summary,
including a 6-point rating scale for defendant's probable
guilt, a 6-point scale for confidence in that verdict, six sen-
tence choices if the defendant were found guilty ranging
from 200 hours of community service, no jail time to 10
years in prison per victim (max sentence allowed), and a
6-point scale of the likelihood that the participant would
forgive such a defendant. See Appendix A for a copy of the
dependent measures. Finally, demographic items, a mortal-
ity salience manipulation check, and a debriefing com-
pleted the survey. The debriefing included an item asking if
the participant had been familiar with the case before the
study began. The study used was based on an actual case
that had been adjudicated earlier in the year in the north-
west, although identifying details of the case were changed.
An additional change to the case was the outcome for the
victims. The victims in the actual case died; however, we
did not want all of our participants to be in a state of mortal-
ity salience; thus, we described the victims as injured rather
than killed. In total, 35 (11.33%) of the participants answer-
ing the question had heard of the case before.
The case presented involved a 22-year-old male named
Michael who had driven through a pile of leaves, not know-
ing that there were two children playing in the leaves. The
children, one male and one female, were described as "seri-
ously injured." The driver heard a bump going through the
leaves, but did not stop. He discovered later in the day that
the children had been hit by a car, but he did not contact the
police, nor did he return to the site of the crime (as required
by law). The male was randomly described as an African
American, Asian, Hispanic, or White, and was given one of
the statistically most common surnames associated with each
racial group in the United States (Washington, Wong,
Rodriguez, or Anderson). The neighborhood in which this
incident took place was described as having a population of
the same racial identity as the defendant so that each case
involved an intraracial incident.
Participants were randomly assigned to one of three ver-
sions of the prosecutor's closing statement within the trial
summary. The prosecutor ended with a request that the jury
think about the fact that they themselves could be victims
of a hit and run driver like the defendant (empathy condi-
tion), that they themselves could be victims of a hit and run
driver like the defendant and could be killed (mortality
salience condition), or no such request was included (con-
trol condition).
Design
The study was a 3 (mortality salience, empathy, or control) ×
4 (race of defendant) factorial design, with the additional
personality variables of empathy and social dominance ori-
entation. Participant race and gender were also included in
analyses. The dependent variables included rating of guilt,
confidence in verdict rating, sentence choice, and rating of
likely forgiveness.
Study 1 Results
Correlations Among Measures
There were significant correlations among the personality
scores and dependent measures. For example, social domi-
nance orientation was negatively correlated with empathy,
r(431) = -.43, p < .001. Guilt rating was negatively related to
the likelihood of forgiveness, r(430) = -.20, p < .001, and
positively related to confidence, r(430) = .33, p < .001. In
addition, participant age correlated with guilt rating, forgive-
ness, and confidence as presented in Table 1.
Manipulation Check
At the end of the survey, participants were asked whether or
not they thought about their own possible deaths while com-
pleting the dependent measures. The response options were
"yes," "slightly but not much," or "not at all." These three
6 SAGE Open
responses were not significantly correlated with the manipu-
lation of mortality salience within the trial summary, 2(4, N
= 399) = 6.12, p = .19. Although more participants reported
thinking of death in the mortality salience condition than in
the other two conditions, the difference did not reach signifi-
cance, even when combining the "slightly but not much" and
the "not at all" respondents together, 2(2, N = 399) = 5.32,
p = .07. Therefore, the analyses involving mortality salience
were done using self-reported thoughts of death as an indica-
tion of the presence of mortality salience.
Familiarity With the Case
The dependent variables were analyzed to determine whether
familiarity with the actual case before the study affected out-
comes for those participants who answered this question.
Although the sample sizes are very different, there were no
significant differences between those who had heard of the
case (n = 35) and those who reported they had not (n = 274)
in the ratings of guilt (p = .41), confidence (p = .83), or sen-
tence (p = .45). However, those familiar with the case were
more likely to forgive the defendant (M = 3.11, SD = 1.17)
than those unfamiliar with the case (M = 3.76, SD = 1.43),
t(306) = 2.61, p < .01. We note that the parents of the victims
in the real case did forgive the defendant.
Gender Differences
Gender differences appeared for empathy scores, t(428) = 6.29,
p < .0001, and for social dominance orientation, t(428) = 4.29,
p < .0001. Females scored higher in empathy (M = 4.82,
SD = .59) than males (M = 4.43, SD = .56); males scored higher
in social dominance orientation (M = 2.62, SD = 1.24) than did
females (M = 2.15, SD = 1.01). We found no significant gender
differences for the dependent variables.
Race of the defendant. There were no main effects by the race
of the defendant on any of the dependent variables (p = .61
for guilt, p = .99 for confidence, p = .30 for type of sentence,
and p = .33 for forgiveness).
Hypotheses
Given the correlations among the dependent measures, we
performed a principal components analysis for the evaluative
dependent variables of guilt, forgiveness, and sentence sever-
ity. This analysis resulted in a single component with an
eigenvalue of 1.50, accounting for 49.84% of the variance.
Therefore, we created a composite dependent variable as a
measure of overall harshness toward the defendant consist-
ing of the sum of the guilt rating, the forgiveness rating, and
a rating (1-6) for the severity of the specific sentence chosen.
For each variable, the higher score indicated the harshest
judgment of the defendant. The lowest possible score on the
composite was a 3, indicating leniency toward the defendant,
and the highest was an 18, indicating a very harsh reaction to
the defendant. This composite score was the primary depen-
dent variable used in the analyses.
For most of the following analyses, we used a MANOVA
to examine the effects of self-reported mortality salience,
defendant race, empathy, and social dominance orientation
on the composite measure and the rating of confidence. The
self-reported responses of mortality salience of "slightly, but
not much" and "no" were combined for the analyses.
H1 and H2: Mortality salience.There were no significant
main effects of mortality salience on the composite measure
of harshness (p = .84) or on ratings of confidence in judg-
ment (p = .30). These results indicated no bias against the
defendant due to mortality salience.
In addition, there were no interactions between defendant
race and mortality salience for the composite score (p = .84)
or confidence (p = .46). We also did these analyses using only
the White participants to examine same race/other race judg-
ments with a sufficient sample size and found no significant
effects by mortality salience and defendant race. The first two
hypotheses were not supported by these data.
H3: Empathy and mortality salience. The mean empathy score
was 4.64 (SD = .60); participants with scores below the mean
were categorized as low in empathy (n = 227) and those

above the mean as high in empathy (n = 205). Respondents
high in empathy had higher composite scores (M = 11.30,
SD = 2.73), indicating harsher overall judgment of the defen-
dant, than did participants low in empathy (M = 10.59,
SD = 2.62), F(1, 361) = 3.70, p = .05, 2 = .01. High empathy
participants appeared to empathize with the victims more
than did low empathy participants, supporting H3. There was
no significant two-way interaction between trait empathy
and self-reported mortality salience on the composite mea-
sure (p = .28). However, there was an interaction between
trait empathy and mortality salience experience for confi-
dence in judgment, F(1, 361) = 5.12, p = .02, 2 = .01. An
examination of the simple effects in post hoc comparisons
indicated that high empathy participants experiencing mor-
tality salience were significantly more confident (M = 4.88,
SD = 1.03) than low empathy participants experiencing mor-
tality salience (M = 4.43, SD = .91), albeit only at the .05
level. There was no difference between high empathy
(M = 4.40, SD = 1.21) and low empathy (M = 4.61,
SD = 1.03) participants without mortality salience. Differ-
ences in confidence by empathy category only appeared
when mortality salience was also present.
In a separate analysis, we also examined the effect of
trait empathy on each of the individual dependent mea-
sures as a function of the empathy prompts embedded in
the experimental texts. The three experimental conditions
involved trial descriptions with no-prompt, an empathy-
only prompt, or an empathy with mortality salience prompt.
In this analysis, similar to the results above, respondents
high in trait empathy were slightly more likely to find guilt
(M = 4.56, SD = 1.18) than participants low in empathy
(M = 4.28, SD = 1.24), F(1, 414) = 3.41, p = .07, 2 = .01
as a main effect. However, the difference in guilt ratings by
trait empathy level occurred primarily in interaction with
the mortality salience prompt condition, F(2, 414) = 2.98,
p = .05, 2 = .01. An examination of the simple effects in
post hoc comparisons indicated that high empathy partici-
pants in the mortality salience prompt condition were sig-
nificantly more likely to rate the defendant guilty
(M = 4.64, SD = 1.05) than low empathy participants in
that condition (M = 4.04, SD = 1.27), t(153) = 3.09, p =
.002. There were no difference between high empathy and
low empathy participants in the other conditions (see
Figure 1). Thus, neither the control condition nor the
empathy-only prompt condition seemed to cause a differ-
ence in judgment by trait empathy. Only the mortality
salience prompt yielded such a result.
H4: Social dominance orientation.Participants were catego-
rized as high in social dominance orientation (n = 193) if
their score was above the sample mean of 2.36 (SD = 1.14)
and low in social dominance orientation (n = 240) if below
the mean. Although there were no significant main effects of
social dominance orientation on the composite measure
(p = .87) or confidence (p = .07), high social dominance
participants were more likely to select a jail sentence for the
defendant, 2(1, N = 423) = 4.10, p = .04 than participants
low in social dominance (see Figure 2).
Finally, a significant three-way interaction was found
between self-reported mortality salience, social dominance,
and empathy for the composite measure, F(1, 361) = 9.85,
p = .002, 2 = .03. There was a significant interaction between
empathy and social dominance for the composite score only
for participants self-reporting mortality salience, F(1, 95) =
8.16, p = .005, 2 = .08). As shown in Figure 3, when experi-
encing mortality salience, participants low in social domi-
nance were harsh in their judgments of the defendant when
high in empathy (M = 12.49, SD = 2.40) and lenient (M =
9.06, SD = 2.98) when low in empathy. In contrast, partici-
pants high in social dominance demonstrated the opposite
pattern: harsher when low in empathy (M = 11.65, SD = 2.70)
and more lenient when high in empathy (composite M =
10.42, SD = 2.41). For those participants not experiencing

mortality salience, there were no differences by personality
(see Figure 4). These results support H3 and H4.
Discussion
There was no indication of mortality salience increasing bias
against defendants in general or increasing bias against
defendants of a different racial group as some past research
on terror management theory might suggest. However,
results did indicate that mortality salience, empathy and
social dominance orientation were all related in some way to
the participants' reactions to the events described in this hit
and run trial summary.
Schimel et al. (2006) also found an interaction between
empathy and mortality salience in their research, with dif-
ferences by trait empathy appearing in the mortality salience
condition. In their research, the ingroup and outgroup
offenders and victims were all adults, and high empathy par-
ticipants did not exhibit bias against outgroup offenders
under mortality salience conditions. Low empathy partici-
pants showed such bias in all conditions. In the present
study, empathy was directed toward the child victims by
high empathy participants, not for the offender. If anything,
high empathy participants exhibited empathic anger against
the defendant in this case. Overall, children as victims
appeared to prime prosocial values for high empathy partici-
pants, consistent with the findings of Jonas et al. (2008).
However, the effects were moderated by social dominance
and mortality salience experience. In effect, mortality
salience triggered personality differences in reactions to the
victims and defendant.
In Study 1, the wording and presentation of the empathy
prompt and mortality salience prompt pushed for empathy
toward the child victims. In addition, the prompts appeared
toward the end of the trial descriptions and thus were among
the last things the participants in those conditions read before
completing the dependent measures. It was not entirely clear,
therefore, whether the child victims would have primed proso-
cial values in high empathy participants absent those specific
prompts. We also were concerned that the results involving
trait empathy, social dominance, and mortality salience might
be due in part to the specific wording and placement of the
prompts because most of the participants self-reporting mor-
tality salience (73.74%) were in one of the prompt conditions.
Therefore, we designed Study 2 to investigate whether mortal-
ity salience, empathy, and social dominance would affect per-
ceptions of a hit and run case in similar patterns if the prompts
appeared earlier and were in favor of the defendant, rather than
on behalf of the victims.
Study 2 Method
Participants
At total of 159 adults completed an online study, 75 female
and 84 male. The sample was 67.30% White, 13.21% Asian,
6.92% Black, and 6.29% Latino/Hispanic, with 5.66% self-
identifying as another racial group or multiracial. The mean
age was 33.41 (SD = 9.83), with a range from 19 to 68.
Participants were solicited via mturk.
Materials and Procedure
The same design and materials from Study 1 were used.
However, there were only two levels of defendant racial
identity, Hispanic or White. Moreover, the three experimen-
tal conditions involved versions of the defense attorney's
summation, rather than the prosecution. The defense ended
the closing statement with a request that the jury think about
Figure 3. Mean composite scores by personal empathy level
and social dominance among participants experiencing mortality
salience in Study 1. Higher scores indicate harsher judgments of
the defendant. A significant interaction between the personality
variables was present for participants who reported mortality
salience, p = .003.

and social dominance among participants who did not report

the fact that they themselves make mistakes as drivers
(empathy condition), that they themselves make mistakes as
drivers and possibly could even be killed in an accident while
driving (mortality salience condition), or no such request
was included (control condition). The additional statements
in the defense summation were approximately equal in
length to the comparable statements in the prosecutor's sum-
mation in Study 1. In this sample, 18 (11.30%) of the partici-
pants had heard of the case before (see Appendix B).
Design
The study was a 3 (mortality salience, empathy, or control) ×
2 (race of defendant) factorial design, with the additional
personality variables of empathy and social dominance ori-
entation. The dependent variables included ratings of guilt,
confidence in verdict, sentence choice, and ratings of for-
giveness. Sentence choice was measured in two ways. In
addition to selecting one of the six specific sentence choices
as in Study 1, respondents also selected a general category of
sentence from a 3-choice item: "no jail," "a brief jail term,"
or "a long jail term."
Study 2 Results
Correlations Among Measures
Similar to the results of Study 1, social dominance orientation
was negatively correlated with empathy scores, r(157) =
-.57, p < .001 and confidence, r(157) = -.22, p < .01. In addi-
tion, guilt ratings were related to confidence, r(157) = .35,
p < .001, and forgiveness, r(156) = -.35, p < .001. Finally,
participant age was related to empathy, social dominance ori-
entation, guilt rating, and confidence as presented in Table 2.
Manipulation Check
At the end of the survey, participants were asked whether or
not they thought of their own possible death while completing
the dependent measures. The four response options were
"yes, thought of death a lot"; "yes, slightly"; "no, not much";
"no, not at all." These responses were correlated with the
experimental mortality salience manipulation. There was no
relationship at all between the manipulation check responses
and the manipulated conditions, 2(2, N = 159) = .55, p = .76.
The mortality salience prompt in the defense attorney's clos-
ing statement in this study did not increase participants'likeli-
hood of reporting a focus on their own death. Given the
apparent failure of the manipulation, we used the self-reported
mortality salience in the analyses rather than the manipulated
conditions.
Gender Differences
Gender differences appeared for empathy scores, t(157) =
4.81, p < .001 and to a lesser degree for social dominance
orientation, t(156) = 1.80, p = .07. Females scored higher in
empathy (M = 4.84, SD = .67) than males (M = 4.35,
SD = .61); males scored higher in social dominance orienta-
tion (M = 2.69, SD = 1.27) than did females (M = 2.31,
SD = 1.43). We found no significant gender differences for
the dependent variables (see Table 3).
Race of the defendant. There were no main effects by the race
of the defendant on any of the individual dependent variables
(p = .84 for guilt, p = .65 for sentence category, p = .81 for
confidence, p = .57 for forgiveness).
Hypotheses
We again created a composite variable, consisting of the sum
of the guilt rating, the forgiveness rating, and a rating (1-6)
for the severity of the specific sentence chosen, to measure
the harshness of judgment against the defendant. For most of
the following analyses, we used a MANOVA to examine the
effects of self-reported mortality salience, defendant race,
empathy, and social dominance orientation on the composite
measure and the rating of confidence. The "yes" choices on
the self-reported responses of mortality salience were com-
bined, as were the "no" choices, to produce two levels of this
variable. We note that the overall sample size for this study
was too small to reliably interpret three- or four-way

interactions. Thus, the main effects and two-way interactions
were analyzed for the composite measure and confidence.
H1 and H2: Mortality salience.Mortality salience was not
related to the composite measure of harshness toward the
defendant (p = .40) or confidence (p = .28). Similarly, a sepa-
rate analysis on the general sentence category indicated no
effect of mortality salience (p = .56). Thus, there was no over-
all bias shown by participants based on their experience of
mortality salience.An analysis of the interaction between mor-
tality salience and defendant race also indicated no significant
effects for the composite (p = .25) or for confidence (p = .56).
In addition, using White participants only to examine
same race/other race effects, there were no racial biases by
reported mortality salience (p = .86 for the composite
measure).
H3: Empathy and mortality salience. Participants were catego-
rized as high in empathy (n = 73) if their scores were above
the mean of 4.55 (SD = .68) and low in empathy (n = 86) if
below the mean. Although there was no main effect of empa-
thy on the composite score (p = .44), there was an interaction
between empathy and mortality salience, although
not significant, F(1, 150) = 3.08, p = .08, 2 = .02. Empathy
differences in the composite score were exhibited when in a
state of self-reported mortality salience; such differences
were absent without mortality salience. For the composite,
participants high in empathy were harsher on the defendant
when experiencing mortality salience; those low in empathy
were more lenient toward the defendant in a mortality
salience state. See Figure 5 for the composite measure data.
These results are similar to those in Study 1; mortality
salience appeared to trigger differences in reactions to the
defendant by empathy. Once again, there was greater appar-
ent empathy with the child victims for high empathy partici-
pants experiencing mortality salience, leading to harsher
perceptions of the defendant. No such personality differ-
ences appeared among participants not experiencing mortal-
ity salience.
H4:Social dominance. Participants were categorized as high in
social dominance orientation (n = 67) if their score was above
the mean of 2.51 (SD = 1.35) and low in social dominance
orientation (n = 92) if below the mean. There was no main
effects of social dominance on the composite measure (p =
.90), but there was an effect on confidence, F(1, 150) = 3.89,
p = .05, 2 = .03. Participants low in social dominance were
more confident in their judgments (M = 4.78, SD = 1.11) than
those high in social dominance (M = 4.44, SD = .96).
In addition, there was a main effect of social dominance
orientation on choice of sentence category. Participants
low in social dominance were equally likely to give no jail,
a brief jail term, or a long term, whereas those high in
social dominance were more likely to selected at least
some form of jail sentence, 2(1, N = 157) = 7.32, p < .01
(see Figure 6).
General Discussion
The most strikingly findings in these studies is the relation-
ship between mortality salience and personality differences
in reactions to the defendant. When mortality salience was
absent, personality differences were minimal. When mortal-
ity salience was experienced, differences by personality,
notably by empathy, were present. This pattern of results

makes sense in light of the theory that people deal with exis-
tential anxiety by clinging to their values (cf. Solomon et al.,
2004) and that those values are reflected by personality traits.
In some sense, people become more true to themselves when
experiencing mortality salience. In support of this theory,
participants' values regarding care for others or empathy in
the present studies was evidenced most when they were
experiencing mortality salience.
There were two common results across these two studies.
First, differences by empathy were more likely to be exhib-
ited when people were experiencing mortality salience,
regardless of whether there was also a prompt to empathize
with the victims or the defendant (see Figure 7). Furthermore,
the pattern of differences by empathy level was the same
regardless of the type of mortality salience prompt: High
empathy participants were harsher on the defendant and the
low empathy participants were more lenient regardless of the
type of mortality salience statements included in the trial
summary.
In the case presented to participants in these two studies,
the injured victims were children. Results indicate that high
empathy participants empathized with the children and their
families, especially when experiencing mortality salience.
Low empathy participants did not show particular empathy
with the victims and were more lenient on the defendant
under mortality salience conditions. This consistency in
results by empathy level and mortality salience suggests sup-
port for the position presented by Jonas et al. (2008) and the
literature on altruism presented by Penner et al. (2005) that
children in need evoke or prime a prosocial norm in people
for whom benevolence is a personal value.
Evidence for the unique position of children as victims of
crime is presented by Sundby (2003) in his research on capi-
tal juries and empathy. Sundby studied jurors' perceptions of
"worthy" and "unworthy" victims and found that jurors were
significantly affected by the age of the victim. No other vic-
tim characteristic affected jurors as much as whether or not
the victim was a child. Although not all jurors indicated that
they would judge a defendant more harshly with a child vic-
tim, 53% of Sundby's respondents did indicate they would
be "much more likely" to select the harshest sentence, the
death penalty, for defendants who had killed children. This
pattern of response indicated greater empathy with child vic-
tims and their families than with any other type of victim
(Sundby, 2003).
The second common finding was that participants high in
social dominance orientation selected harsher sentences
across conditions. This finding is consistent with past
research on social dominance orientation (cf. Pratto et al.,
1994). Social dominance orientation is related to conserva-
tive values, and the finding that people with a high social
dominance orientation were more likely to select a jail sen-
tence for the hit and run driver is consistent with a "law and
order" conservative political stance.
The results of these studies do not support the idea that
mortality salience may significantly contribute to differ-
ences in perceptions of cases based on defendant race
within the criminal justice system, however. There were no
significant findings regarding the interaction between the
race of the defendant and race of the participants for this
case and this research design. As discussed above, it is pos-
sible that having children as the injured parties evoked
norms strong enough to erase other types of bias. Past
research with adult defendants and adult victims has found
effects of mortality salience on both overall and racialized
views of criminal defendants (cf. Arndt et al., 2005;
Greenberg et al., 2001).
In addition, the findings of the two present studies do not
necessarily reveal factors that would appear among jurors in
an actual courtroom. The lack of racial disparity in the treat-
ment of the defendant in these studies does not negate the
possibility of racial effects by personality and mortality
salience within the criminal justice system. Given the design,
we have studied perceptions and judgments when reading
about a case, as if in a news report. We did not ask partici-
pants to engage in a mock trial, nor did we study

decision-making processes by police, attorneys, judges, and
juries in cases carrying real consequences.
The findings of this research do inform an understanding
of public perceptions of criminal cases, however. When
cases appear in electronic or print media, people react as to
the perceived fairness of trial outcomes. In turn, perceptions
of the criminal justice system are affected by such percep-
tions. Based on our research, more conservative members of
the public who are high in social dominance orientation are
likely to expect harsher sentences and may therefore be criti-
cal of leniency by judges. Similarly, people high in empathy
may expect harsher treatment of defendants in cases that
prompt victim empathy for them.
Limitations
Based on the discussion above, the general limitations of
these two studies include the following. First, participants
read about cases via a written summary presented online;
they did not participate in any deliberations or view a live-
action trial. The victims in the case were children, which
may evoke a different pattern of normative reactions from
participants than evoked by adult victims. In addition, the
case involved an ambiguous unintentional criminal inci-
dent. Judgments about cases with offenders who engaged
in intentional crimes, violent or nonviolent, may be quite
different.
There are also limitations due to the nature of the samples.
Using both a college participant pool and mturk increased
the diversity of the sample in term of age and racial identity.
However, the sample is still not representative of adults in
the United States who might serve on juries or who might
read about criminal cases in a news source. For example, the
present samples were younger in age (median = 29) than the
general population in the United States (median = 37.70;
U.S. Census Bureau, 2015a). Furthermore, the samples
underrepresent the percentage of Hispanic (17.40%) and
Black or African American (13.20%) individuals, and over-
represent Asians (5.40%) in the United States (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2015b). Finally, the samples are not random; the stu-
dents and adults on mturk are self-selected; their views may
differ from the general adult population. Therefore, further
research is needed to determine whether the current findings
generalize.
