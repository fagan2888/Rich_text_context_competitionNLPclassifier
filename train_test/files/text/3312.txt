The Soviet Union's achievement of being the first to trans-
verse the space barrier with unmanned and manned vehicles
could be considered one of the major defining moments in
schooling for contemporary America. According to Brand
and Johnson (2001), the Soviet's feat led to the belief that the
nation's schools were deficient in math, science, and tech-
nology. Consequently, the National Defense Education Act
(NDEA) was enacted in 1958 to fund and promote educa-
tional activities to advance the use of technology, and teach-
ing and learning to strengthen national security. Similar to
how NDEA was established to address the problem of tech-
nological readiness, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)
was established to address the increasing problem of poor
school performance. Its purpose was to initiate a launch
sequence to boost the nation's sputtering schools out of the
low orbit of failure for far too many children to a higher
orbit--encompassing success for all children. This time,
with NCLB as the boosters, public school principals were to
be the thrusters that steered the ship.
The NCLB provided motivation to identify the most
important factors contributing to school success or failure.
Its mandate was driven, in part, by the need to address the
failure of Black students (U.S. Department of Education
[U.S. DOE], 2005). There is now a significant concern over
the failure of male students (disproportionately Blacks),
which is being blamed on the "feminization of schools"
(Bradley, 2004; Chen & Addi, 1992; Mulvey, 2009;
Steffenhagen, 2001). According to Bitterman, Goldring, and
Gray (2013), in the 2011-2012 school year, 52% of the
nation's 89,810 public school principals were females of
whom 64% were in primary, 42% in middle, and 30% in high
schools.
Noteworthy, it has been suggested that within the White
male (androcentric) establishment, which significantly con-
trols school superintendencies, there are sectors cultivating
bias against female principals; such an exercise is not the
purpose of this study. The rhetoric from both sides of the
debate is heated, situational, and personal. As such, Froese-
Germain (2006) called for a dialogue informed by research.
The findings of such possible research, demonstrated by the
result in Figure 1, would provide empirical evidence reveal-
ing that in 18 years, females moved from 34.5% of nation's
overall public school principalship to the most recent 52%, a
17.5% gain. In the same time frame, Whites lost 4.2% of
principalships (84.2%-80%), Blacks lost 0.1% (10.1%-10%),
and Hispanics lost 1.1% (4.1%-3%). On the contrary,
"Other," which includes Asians, made a 2.2% gain. The

Effect of Principal and Student Gender on
New York City High School Performance
Outcomes
Rupert Green1
Abstract
A mixed-methods study enabled the exploration of New York City high school data, analyzing performance/demographic
scores based on principal and/or student gender, boroughs, and other factors found the following: Significant differences in
boroughs' college and career readiness scores, 2(4, N = 369) = 26.830, p = .00, with (a) the highest mean rank of 251 for
Staten Island, and the lowest mean rank of 156 for Brooklyn; (b) larger socioeconomically integrated schools more successful;
(c) failure in small Manhattan and Bronx segregated/poverty female-majority schools; and (d) male students, F(4, 359) = 2.49,
p = .043, partial 2 = .027, attained significantly lower scores. Enrollment was significant, F(1, 457) = 7.215, p < .05 partial
2 = .940, with male principals (M = 746.40, SD = 903.58) leading larger schools. Recommendations include the following:
gifted vocational education school, gauging for feminization, more Black/Hispanic principals; and assurance of licensed
vocational educators.

significance of such result is as follows: Although Blacks
and Hispanics made gains to now constitute the nation's stu-
dent majority, they lost principalship positions.
Purpose
The purpose of the present study was to examine the rela-
tionship, if any, between principal and student gender, New
York City (NYC) high school performance scores, and/or
other select moderators.
Definition of Key Terms
Large schools. Large schools are those with 1,000 or more
students (U.S. DOE, 2009).
Medium schools. By default, for this study, medium
schools are those with 451 to 999 students. These are the
schools not within the range of small and large schools.
Small schools. Small schools are those with 450 or fewer
students (New York City Department of Education
[NYCDOE], 2013b).
Moderator. "Factors that affect the strength or the direction
of the relationship between the intervention and student
education outcomes" (Institute of Education Sciences,
2014, p. iii). Such could be a function of students' demo-
graphic characteristic, or factors within schools, neighbor-
hoods, or educators (Institute of Education Sciences, 2014).
Literature Review
Previous research has shown that gender-specific behaviors
affect school principals'practices and may affect the individual
performance of students as well as the overall performance of
schools. Females were shown to utilize a collaborative team
approach that involves consensus-building in a system where
males represented the established and idealized concept of
leadership (Durrah, 2009). The idealization of male character-
istics emanated from an androcentric perspective, whereby
masculine values were elevated as superior and female values
were discounted to make them appear inferior (Bethel-Jackson,
2005). Androcentrism has been described as a "pervasive cul-
tural bias that affects interpretations of both gender similarities
and gender differences" and is evident when maleness is the
default value, resulting in "masculine pronouns being used to
represent women and men" (Hegarty, 2006, p. 1).Addi-Raccah
(2002) found that, under such conditions, female principals
were more likely to appoint males as assistant principals (APs).
Principals appointing APs may be the case in Israel, on which
Addi-Raccah's study focused, but it is not the case in NYC.
However, it is believed that as the power of U.S. female
principals increased with their growing number, they were
more likely to alter the gender composition of their schools'
pedagogical staff (Addi-Raccah, 2002). Nevertheless, sev-
eral other studies have reported that the success of female
principals is dependent on access to resources that are more
readily available to male principals within their androcentric
network (Jull, 2002; Mertz, 2006).
Freigruber (2009) reported that principals were a critical
factor in school success and that characteristics related to
their gender and race influenced the achievement scores of
urban schools and principal behavior. The significance of
principal behavior is found in Winfrey's (2009) study "How
Teachers Perceive Their Job Satisfaction Is Influenced by
Their Principals' Behaviors and Attitudes Related to Race
and Gender," wherein student academic performance was
found to be a function of teacher job satisfaction.
Notwithstanding that principals do not regularly teach, they
are held responsible for student performance (Eginli, 2009).
While some studies found no difference in how male and
female principals ran their schools (Lally, 2008), Durrah
(2009) reported that teachers and principals perceived dif-
ferences in behavior between male and female principals.
She found that male principals exhibited leadership charac-
teristics that were challenging in nature (i.e., nonsubmis-
sive). Earlier studies also found that men were aggressive,
assertive, and domineering (Eagly, Karau, & Johnson,
1992), which led teachers to prefer them as principals of
high schools (Brooks, 2009). Shakeshaft (1987, as cited in
Chen & Addi, 1992) also reported that females preferred
males as principals. Another study reported that male princi-
pals were more successful at long-term planning, which is
an important component of annual school performance indi-
cators (Brooks, 2009). Finally, Chen and Addi (1992) found
that more senior and higher ranked teachers worked more
with male principals than female principals, and both male
and female teachers expressed greater satisfaction working
with male principals.

Female principals, on the contrary, were perceived as
appealing to the heart, responsive, sensitive, and having a
nurturing disposition (Durrah, 2009; Eagly etal., 1992)--
qualities more conducive to working with children and
endearing to some teachers and parents (Brooks, 2009).
Furthermore, female principals were reported to have an
affinity for lower socioeconomic status (SES) students, to be
more engaging with teachers, and to be more effective at
day-to-day running of the school, resulting in better daily
performance indicators such as attendance (Brooks, 2009).
Other studies revealed that students performed better and
teachers were more involved, collegial, and cooperative with
administration when the principals were females (Chen &
Addi, 1992).
As the number of female principals increased, strong
women principals could emerge to change the narrative that
previously described such school leaders as token women.
Token women lacked power, requiring some to either act as
males to prove their competence, or be more prone to employ
males as APs (Addi-Raccah, 2002). As previously noted,
NYC principals do not employ APs, and so I digress to elab-
orate. In NYC, the process of hiring APs (or other adminis-
trators) was compromised to ensure whomever the principals
or the superintendents wanted was hired. Such nepotism was
routine, and it was for such and similar reasons that
Chancellor Fariña issued new regulations mandating that all
individuals wishing to become school principals or APs have
either 5 or 7 years teaching experience (NYC DOE, 2014).
To return to the previous discussion, Kanter (1997, as
cited in Cognard-Black, 2004) described token women as
those few in an organization dominated by men. Such women
were made highly visible, were more scrutinized, and were
taxed with a higher expectation of success. Female Black
principals reported being even more scrutinized and having
to create a persona of authority and competence (Pollard,
1997).
As more females began to fill principal positions, a grow-
ing concern was the significant "feminization of schools" led
by female principals compared with those led by males
(Chen & Addi, 1992). Anecdotal reports depicting concerns
about school feminization have been found in countries such
as Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Three examples are
(a) Bradley's (2004) publication "Why Boys Drop Out: Few
Male Teachers; Feminization of Our Schools Hurts Boys,"
(b) Steffenhagen's (2001) "The `Feminization'of Elementary
Schools: Absence of Male Teachers a `Worldwide Puzzle,'
Professor Says," and (c) Gray's (2004) "Canty Boys Keen on
Segregated Classes With More PhysicalAction." Meanwhile,
National Public Radio's (NPR; 2011) "Are Single-Sex
Classrooms Better for Kids?" is indicative of U.S. public
debate on the matter.
A question relevant to the above concerns was found in
the title of Chen and Addi's (1992) article "Are Male
Teachers in a Female-Dominated Workplace Gender
Tokens?" Male teachers became opposed to the idea of being
token males working in female-dominated schools, which
decreased the likelihood that schools led by female princi-
pals would have more male teachers (Chen & Addi, 1992).
However, these findings were contradicted by Cognard-
Black's (2004) study, which found that male elementary
school teachers enjoyed more privileges and preferred work-
ing with female principals. Other studies have suggested that
men who occupy seats of power in school administrations
tend to promote actions and narratives that sustain and sup-
port the traditional patriarchal framework to maintain their
career, power, and perks (Jull, 2002; Mertz, 2006). Such
actions could impede the success of female principals.
With the number of female principals steadily rising, prior
discussions around token women may no longer be relevant.
However, Black and Latino females comprise a small per-
centage of public school principals (National Center for
Educational Statistics [NCES], 2013a) and, as the demo-
graphic shift elevates their significance, White males who
are predominantly school superintendents may hire Blacks
and Latinos as token principals. The implication is that the
closely guarded and hard-to-penetrate "old boys' network"
could deny Black, Latino, and other female principals,
resources such as mentoring that they need to succeed at
their jobs (Jull, 2002; Mertz, 2006).
However, Carter (2009) found that schools with mentored
principals did not achieve higher performance scores than
schools with nonmentored principals. Still, Citty (2010)
found mentoring to be most effective at helping principals
become successful school leaders. Based on the discrepancy,
Citty revealed a list of other resources that will aid principal
success. They include authority and autonomy, start-up
funds, management teams, and access to advanced profes-
sional development that teaches how to use data to drive
school improvement.
As asserted in numerous studies cited in Méndez-Morse
(2004), mentoring was an established and recommended
practice in the androcentric culture of educational adminis-
tration. According to Schwiebert (2000), mentors "provide
support to their protégés in an effort to remove organiza-
tional barriers, to assist protégés in negotiating the `sys-
tem,' and to provide protégés with opportunities for upward
mobility" (as cited in Méndez-Morse, 2004, p. 3). Because
mentors were likely to choose similar and like-minded indi-
viduals (i.e., White males) as protégés, those of a different
race, ethnicity, or gender were generally overlooked
(Méndez-Morse, 2004). Consequently, Black and Latino
female administrators, who are often placed as leaders of
difficult schools (NCES, 2013b), must contend with "isms"
associated with race, ethnicity, and gender while being
denied the needed help that mentoring could accord
(Méndez-Morse, 2004) and those outlined in Citty (2010).
Flores (2011) coined the term racialized tokens to describe
Latina administrators serving the same token roles under
White female principals as the White female principals
served under male principals.

In Regents (1998), the New York State Education
Department (NYSED) outlined the inextricable link between
student performance and capable school leadership as well as
the Regents' calls for diversity in the state's school leadership
cadre. Children in urban schools, especially those belonging to
racial minorities, need to see in their leaders role models with
which they could identify and emulate (Ett, 2008). It has been
opined that "administrators and staff should be accountable for
their position as leaders and role models that students will
emulate" (Anthony, 2008, p. 123). Méndez-Morse (2004)
stated that school superintendents should be similarly held
accountable as role models for female and minority school
leaders. The NYSED's plan to expand diversity in the state's
school administrative cadre was dictated by NCLB. An earlier
mandate, Title IX, also addressed gender inequality in school
administrations (Mertz, 2006).
As noted above, the NYSED action has implications for
the success of NYC schools, especially those that are racially/
ethnically segregated. It could help the many NYC male and
female Black and Hispanic teachers who aspire to leadership
positions in their schools but cannot get their foot in the door
because of the barriers they face (Green, 2012). As princi-
pals, such individuals could help address the issue of teach-
ers who, being oblivious to, or dismissive of, students'
culture or lived experience, resort to disciplinary actions that
initiate students' school failure (Graham & Erwin, 2011;
Green, 2012). The school-to-prison pipeline is the common
term used to explain the causal effect of such action.
According to Editorial Board (2013),
One unfortunate result has been the creation of a repressive
environment in which young [Black] people are suspended,
expelled or even arrested over minor misbehaviors--like talking
back or disrupting class--that would once have been handled by
the principal. (para. 1)
Apart from their fear of Black students (Green, 2012), the
basis for such action on the part of many White school
administrators is explained in Cohen (1973). She revealed
that many Whites may lack frequent encounter with experi-
enced Black teachers of their own age, who made impressive
display of their skills and the role modeling of Black compe-
tence. In addition, they infrequently met (Black) authority
figures who exuded confidence and an unequivocal and
jovial (nondefensive) attitude regarding their ability to
impart their skills to benefit Whites. Such Blacks would
exhibit "equal status behavior" as opposed to the "diffused
status characteristics," whereas Whites expected them to
assume an inferior role. Cohen reminds me of a White stu-
dent-teacher colleague who, more than 25 years ago, revealed
to the class that her first interaction with Blacks began with
her tenure as a New York teacher. She revealed her opinion
of them was informed by the media.
In 1997, Pollard, foreshadowing the demographic shift, dis-
cussed the paltry number of Blacks in school administration,
the lack of research considering the interaction of race and gen-
der, and the failure of researchers to illuminate the gender of
participants referred to as minorities. (Of course, such state-
ment may have been made with or without the knowledge of
Cohen's seminal work.) She (Pollard) further revealed the
shortcomings of the few studies on Black school leaders, which
rendered invisible the historical pedigree of their involvement
in school administration and their success as administrators
under the nation's earlier segregated school system.
In addressing her concerns, a later study outlined the dev-
astation that Brown v. Board of Education (1954) wrought on
Black principals (Gooden, 2012; Karpinski, 2006). Some
were summarily fired, forbidden to be administrators of
White teachers or of schools with White children, made into
janitors, or given menial tasks. Underlying this treatment
was the propagation of the narrative depicting Black princi-
pals as callous, ineffective, or unqualified (Gooden, 2012;
Karpinski, 2006).
The removal of Black principals from prominence as role
models for children and members of the Black community
certainly contributed to the current school failure of Black
males and the corresponding adverse impact on those seek-
ing career in education (Karpinski, 2006). The U.S. Secretary
of Education, Arne Duncan, outlined the basis of the current
problem in Graham and Erwin (2011), where he stated, "It is
especially troubling that less than 2 percent of our nation's
3.2 million teachers are African American males. It is not
good for any of our country's children that only one in 50
teachers is a Black man" (p. 398). The evolving shortage of
Black male teachers resulted in fewer Black male principals
(Greenlee, 1997; Madkins, 2011). Female Black teachers
and principals were similarly affected (Berry, 2005).
Fairchild (2009) found that Black female principals were
negatively correlated with White teachers' job satisfaction.
In contrast, Pollard (1997) found that Black principals used
racial identification with Black students to bridge the barrier
for White teachers, helping them better educate those stu-
dents. These findings highlighted the need for principals to
adopt practices that bridge achievement gaps between vari-
ous student groups. According to Brown and Beckett (2007),
the failure of Black students in segregated schools led to the
employment of more Black administrators who were
building on a practice of school and community leadership in
separate Black education that involved extensive engagement
with White school district officials and other individuals and
groups, was able to facilitate communication between
disadvantaged Black families and middle-class White teachers
and school district officials, with the result that all stakeholders
worked together effectively to develop policies and programs
that improved student behavior and academic achievement. (p. 8)
Cooper (2006) described the pioneering work of a female
principal, Leah Hasty, who established an all-Black class-
room with a male Black teacher to provide a role model for
Green 5
Black Baltimore school boys, which resulted in a modifica-
tion of NCLB. To advance Hasty's work, the U.S. DOE
adopted new rules giving public schools the option to estab-
lish single-sex schools and classes as long as equal opportu-
nity and choice was available to all students (Cooper, 2006).
The modification of NCLB by three U.S. Senators, including
Hillary Clinton of New York, allowed principals in New
York and other states to experiment with all-male school
improvement initiatives (Cooper, 2006). In NYC, examples
of such schools are the Eagle Academy, the Urban Assembly
for Law and Justice, and the Bedford Academy. These were
reasonably high performing schools, with all-male Black and
Latino students and male principals who focused on learning
rather than raising test scores (Rios, 2012).
The counterpart is the all-female student, and female-
principal-led and high performing Young Women's
Leadership School. All-female schools generally outperform
all-male schools (Cooper, 2006). While the NCLB modifica-
tion is silent regarding the noted self-selected racial segrega-
tion of the schools referenced, given the gravity of school
failure of Black and Hispanic students, the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and
other groups have also remained mute with respect to legal
challenges (Cooper, 2006), giving principals the leeway to
experiment.
While some studies explain that urban students'success is
influenced by principals who are role models by virtue of
sharing gender and racial characteristics with students, other
studies (Larsen, 2008; Toure, 2008) have described success-
ful Black and high-poverty urban schools led by White male
administrators. These studies outlined how some principals,
with the aid of Black APs, were able to advance culturally
relevant pedagogical practices described in Ladson-Billings
(1995)1 and serve as a bulwark against White staff members
who would advance deficit-thinking theory to stereotype stu-
dents and their families.
Deficit-thinking theory ascribes various labels to urban
students and blames school failure on students' unprepared-
ness to learn, parental disinterest in education, and family
lifestyle (Ford, Moore, & Scott, 2011). In contrast, the litera-
ture contains several reports of high-poverty urban schools
where both Black and White principals, male and female,
were successful (Gerhart, Harris, & Mixon, 2011; Gulbin,
2008; Williams, 2008). Various keys to the success of such
schools were their winning grant writers, embrace of paren-
tal involvement, collective efficacy, data driven assessment
to improve teaching and learning, and/or mindfulness--a
function of transformative school leaders (Gulbin, 2008).
With respect to the relationship between principal behav-
ior and student gender, several studies reported that females'
collaborative and consensus-building style was being
imposed on, and reinforced in, children from kindergarten to
Grade 12 (Mulvey, 2009; Rowley & Wright, 2011). Such
approach was reported to adversely affect the education of
boys and was a factor in their academic lag behind girls
(Johnson & Gooliaff, 2013). It was suggested that such a
feminine approach to teaching and learning was incompati-
ble with boys' socialization and learning styles (Martino &
Kehler, 2006). In addressing the problem with New Zealand
boys, a principal revealed boys do not succeed "in the sit
down, shut up and open your books environment" they have
a kinesthetic (movement orientated) learning style that
requires more physical actions (Gray, 2004, p. 1). In a U.S.
study, Chambers (2009) found that males tended to be louder,
more physically aggressive, and they exhibited classroom
behaviors that forced teachers to engage in more male-
dominated classroom activities. Boys in that study received
70% of the F grades. However, a solution may be found in
Johnson and Gooliaff (2013) who wrote,
Hawley and Reichert (2010) found that what works well for
boys were lessons that: * produce products; * are structured as
games; * involve vigorous motor activity; * give boys
responsibility for promoting learning of others; * challenge boys
to address "open" unsolved problems; * require a combination
of teamwork and competition; and * introduce dramatic
novelties and surprises. (p. 29)
As noted above, there is growing support for all-boys
schools with males as teachers and administrators. However,
some have expressed concern and caution against pigeonhol-
ing and warehousing male students as low performers
(Cooper, 2006). "Despite the claim that male teachers are
more tolerant of `hands-on' learning, there is no available
evidence that this actually produces better educational out-
comes for boys" (Martino & Kehler, 2006, p. 123). Still,
Green (2012) advocated a 21st-century Vocational Education
(VE) Curriculum to address students' school failure. Froese-
Germain (2006) advised that attempts should be made to
identify which boys were failing, rather than categorizing
them all as failures based on their gender. Nevertheless, low
SES boys generally do have poorer educational outcomes
(Arnold & Doctoroff, 2003; Legewie & Diprete, 2012).
Notwithstanding, a solution is possible.
Public school educators and parents have expressed sup-
port for single-gender schools (Chambers, 2009; Harris,
2009). Such support could compel principals to address the
concern raised in Boys ("Let Boys Be Boys," 2003), which
reported,
Educators are beginning to quantify an "enthusiasm gap"
between girls and boys in co-ed public schools. The reason:
Schools, especially elementary schools, have become feminized.
Elementary school teachers and administrators, who once
understood that boys will be boys, now act, at least, as though
they expect boys to be more like girls. Their hostility to the male
character--intentional or not--is turning boys off learning. (p. 1)
The NCLB has offered principals the means to eliminate
maleness as an excuse for male student failure, just as Title 1
was earlier enacted to eliminate poverty as an excuse for the
6 SAGE Open
failure of low SES students (Ett, 2008). A history of the prob-
lem illuminates the issue. According to Ett (2008), way prior
to NCLB (in 1935-1936), when rural schools were poor and
failing, and the majority of the nation's northern students
were from prosperous families, because an influx of poor
students began to enter northern schools, schools adopted a
stance aimed at education of the majority. Thus, Ett (2008)
revealed, "early attempt at `tracking' created special schools
for physically and mentally handicapped children" (p. 29).
Those schools
contained "special classes" filled with children who were
considered "backward" or "disruptive." These were unruly
classes filled with a majority of boys, most of who suffered from
no physical or developmental problems. They simply did not fit
the profile of the normal child and were relegated to a limited
education. (Ett, 2008, p. 29)
Given that NCLB requires success for all the nation's
schools, principals are situated at the forefront of this chal-
lenge, similar to how schools were similarly situated and
challenged to regain the nation's pride after the Soviet's
spectacular space success. Principals have the power to
shape school culture and the tools to make a difference (Deal
& Peterson, 1999). Irrespective of the challenges presented
by their gender and other characteristics, they must possess
the wisdom to guide change while navigating resistance
(Evans, 2004). However, moderators and malleable factors
influence school performance.
Socioeconomic Integration
Kahlenberg (2012-2013) has long advanced socioeconomic
integration to correct the failure of Black (and Hispanic)
urban students. He asserts that Blacks who attended (White)
schools desegregated by socioeconomic integration attained
greater school success than their peers in urban segregated
schools. He revealed that the assertion angered Black leaders
because they misunderstood him. The 1960 Coleman Report
advanced similar argument (Mickelson & Greene, 2006).
Kahlenberg (2012-2013) reported that in desegregated
White suburban schools, Blacks (and Hispanics) were
exposed to their peers' self-empowering linguistics, their
middle-class values, and related social and cultural capitals.2
He asserts middle-class values, not students' color, was the
most significant factor behind Black (or Hispanic) success in
aforementioned schools. Such values included middle-class
parents' in-school involvement--which was more highly
regarded and respected by school administrators. Herein one
can understand the angst of Black leaders who challenged
Kahlenberg's assertion. They were being asked to accept that
their children's success impinged on the devaluation of their
communities and the embrace of "Acting White" advanced
in Fordham and Ogbu (1986)--which caused many smart
Black youth to devalue achievement striving, not wanting to
be isolated from, or ostracized, by their peers in their neigh-
borhoods. The phenomenon is a troubling problem that needs
to be explored. Many smart NYC Black youth may not get
into the city's specialized high schools for the reasons
discussed.
In Search of Framework for a Model to Counter
Blaming the Victims of Miseducation
Not everyone agrees with Kahlenberg (2012-2013). Many
individuals (including educators) subscribe to deficit-think-
ing theory in blaming the victims (Blacks and Latinos) for
school failure (Ford etal., 2011). Some studies highlight
the dearth of Black role models in school leadership posi-
tions who could (a) provide a counter narrative in culturally
relevant pedagogy advanced in Ladson-Billings (1995) or
(b) the embrace of intercultural sensitivity wherein "they
are willing to modify their behavior as an indication of
respect for the people of other cultures" (Bhawuk & Brislin,
1992, p. 416).
However, other studies provide a framework for improv-
ing NYC urban schools. Examples are works such as Larsen
(2008) and Toure (2008). They revealed successful Black
urban schools led by White and Black male administrators.
Again, the literature is informative, with studies (e.g., Gerhart
etal., 2011; Gulbin, 2008; Williams, 2008) reporting suc-
cessful urban schools led by either Black or White adminis-
trators, or both groups coleading schools to successful
outcomes for students.
Notwithstanding the need for racial minorities to see role
models in school leadership (Ett, 2008), the remedy must
neither be underscored nor obviated with principals who are
racialized tokens (Flores, 2011), token men, token females
(Addi-Raccah, 2002; Cognard-Black, 2004), or those who
are not reflective practitioners. Token individuals, especially
given the condition of some male teachers' reluctance to
working with female principals, are unlikely to be up to the
challenge, or possess the withitness (Barton, 2010) to edu-
cate NYC (difficult) youth. For example, as a VE teacher, I
was subjected to the meet, greet, and discuss modus operandi
of a White female AP; I thoroughly resented the process
because I had never done such things before; I came out of a
school where such activities were never practiced, and I
frankly viewed it as feminine. Consequently, a charge of
insubordination was lodged against me, which the White
male principal overturned.
It is not that I lacked commitment to students. But inter-
acting with male students who have been exposed to the
criminal justice system, who may both look up and down on
me (I am 6 feet tall and many students are more than 6 feet),
who are street-wise, and who have been failed by traditional
school required that I develop a different persona or a withit-
ness to relate to them. The newly appointed AP lacked such
withitness regarding her staff.
Green 7
The emerging problem NYC schools must address is to
avoid having administrators of either gender with no trade or
industry experience flaunting NYSED regulation and lead-
ing VE or Career and Technical Education (CTE) schools.
The problem has emerged because of the state's Career
Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) require-
ments necessitating more CTE certified instructors and
administrators. It is a problem similar to that where, under
the Bloomberg administration, individuals with little or no
teaching experience became school administrators, causing
Chancellor Fariña's previously noted action.
It is an imperative to address the problem because VE was
found to encourage dropout-prone male students to complete
their education (Green, 2012), and undermining the program
with unqualified administrators is counterproductive and in
violation of the NYSED laws and hurtful to students. Schools
cannot grant CTE credits if the teachers are not certified, as
some NYC schools/programs are presently doing.
VE
Chambers (2009) revealed how loud, boisterous, and physi-
cal male students received significant number of Grade F.
Those students' behavior could be frightening to teachers,
and the resulting loss of class time due to office referrals or
suspensions could contribute to the number of F grades
given. However, previously referenced studies, and some I
am currently undertaking in NYC schools, confirm that male
students received significantly more Grade F compared with
female students. A noteworthy contradiction is that in NYC
gifted high schools, there are more male students, implying
more gifted males received higher grades than gifted female
students. According to the latest data, the majority of stu-
dents in the city (and the nation's) gifted schools were Asians
(NCES, 2008). Nonetheless, various studies (e.g., Gloria &
Ho, 2003; Zhao & Qiu, 2009) outline some reasons for their
success and the problems Asians face with meeting the
expectations of being the "model minority" and the poster
child for academic success. The fact that students can be
vocationally gifted (Green, 2012) warranted this line of dis-
cussion. It is also noteworthy that throughout the nation,
Asians generally shun VE (Green, 2012).
Gray (2004) explained how male students need kinesthet-
ically enhanced (mobile) classrooms experience. An exam-
ple of such pedagogical practice/classroom facilities is
provided in the School of Cooperative Technical Education
(Co-Op Tech). It is an alternative education VE program in
NYC's District 79.
NYC school performance is also assessed on college or
career readiness performance scores. The career component
is the assessment of CTE/VE subjects taught in schools.
Some of the city's academic schools also offer CTE/VE.
Co-Op Tech, established in 1946, is a model VE program
that attracts many interested students, especially males who
failed regular schools, or those sentenced by the courts to
attend school as an alternative to incarceration. Students in
the program are not subjected to the high-stake tests they
faced in regular high schools. Many successful students
complete their study with a high paying skill, and New York
State (NYS) or industry licenses/certificates. Skills include
plumbing, carpentry, computer repairs, welding, child care,
vision care, building maintenance, and culinary arts. Male
students enjoy the hands-on approach to learning, the com-
petition, the interaction with male teachers and their no-non-
sense approach--gained from their earlier experience as
industry tradesmen.3 Their interactions exemplify the vigor-
ous activities recommended in Johnson and Gooliaff (2013)
to address male students' failure.
However, in a manner demonstrating the devaluing of VE
in NYC (as it was eliminated from NYC middle schools),
Co-OpTech's school building was sold by Mayor Bloomberg.
Consequently, some teachers were left floundering to find
new sites, while others were assigned to cold basements.
Despite the problem, students attended the unsuitable classes.
Other evidence of VE devaluation is its current use as pro-
grams to shunt/"dump" special need students.
While Common Core State Standards (CCSS) is designed
to eliminate curricula that are not rigorous, schools are
required to educate students who can only be a tradesper-
son's helper. According to NYSED (2013), disabled students
who are unable to earn a regular diploma may graduate with
only the NYS CDOS Commencement Credential, only as
long as the students are provided "access to career and tech-
nical education (CTE) coursework and opportunities to
engage in school supervised work-based learning experi-
ences, either in school and/or in the community" (paras. 4-5).
Some such students cannot remember instruction without
being continually told what to do, whereas others can master
a single skill and perform it repetitiously; thereby justifying
my earlier tradesperson helper reference.
Previously, such students were kept in academic schools
and were issued a "worthless" Individualized Education
Program (IEP) diploma if they passed the state exam.
College and the military did not accept the IEP diploma, but
would accept it in conjunction with the local high school
diploma. Said institutions do not accept the CDOS creden-
tials, which some educators revealed is so worthless the
state does not call it a diploma. Its purpose is to certify to
employers that the holder possesses employability and
trainability skills. Because of the new state regulations,
academic schools without certified CTE personnel are inca-
pable of providing CTE/credits or certification. Therefore,
a once vibrant VE curriculum at Co-Op Tech is becoming
watered down as a very expensive way to accommodate
special needs students, whom principals from other schools
are happy to send. According to Lehr and Lange (2003),
"Use of alternative schools avoids addressing the systemic
issue. Once we create an alternative school, the high school
is off the hook. They don't have to change in order to serve
these kids" (p. 10).
8 SAGE Open
At Co-Op Tech, the principal revealed, it costs over
US$100,000 a year to educate a student--more than the
combined costs of any two Ivy League colleges. Still, Co-Op
Tech is a program and is not listed as one of the DOE's CTE
schools. Currently, 38% of the city's 50 CTE schools are
female led; in 2010, it was 48% of the 29 schools, and in
2008, it was 45% of the 22 schools. Such data suggest that
CTE schools are mostly led by males. However, the gender
of the staff and the type of courses being offered were not
determined.
The aforementioned undertaking is an expensive way to
track students (assigned to certain classes based on real or
perceived ability). Notwithstanding, tracking has a historical
pedigree in the U.S. educational system, wherein VE was
used as a dumping ground for Blacks and those described as
the intellectually feeble-minded (Green, 2012). Historically,
such actions caused many Black and other interested parents
to shun VE for their children. It must be noted, nationwide,
Asians do not take VE in any significant number (Green,
2012).
At Co-Op Tech, VE teachers are generally older males, but
as they retire, and there is a problem with finding experienced
tradesmen to become vocational instructors, more female
educators are being hired. However, they are not entering as
teachers of carpentry, welding, plumbing, bricklaying, elec-
tricity, and other hard-hat VE trades more appealing to male
students, but rather as special needs teacher, teachers of
courses such as medical billing, medical office assistants--
more appealing to female students. The problem here is while
hard-hat and kinesthetically orientated VE courses encourage
male students to complete their education, CTE schools are
now offering more sit-down and less movement-orientated
courses, such as those previously described and others deal-
ing with some areas of information technology.
A reason is many of the new teachers do not have the
NYSED licensure requirements of 2 years industry experi-
ence. Consequently, because finding qualified CTE teacher
is a widespread problem (Green, 2012), some principals hire
uncertified individuals with work experience alluding to
CTE. The problem of hiring is more pronounced when the
principals have no CTE experience, as required by NYSED
laws.
It is less risky for principals to employ individuals claim-
ing to have medical office management or web design skills
as opposed to employing those claiming to have carpentry or
electrical installation skills. Although the former individuals
can have students sit at a computer and learn, even if experi-
enced carpenters were employed, without CTE credentials,
they cannot teach students how to use power saw and other
power equipment. In fact, in NYS, a non-CTE certified
teacher cannot legally cover a CTE shop class if the CTE
teacher is absent, but a CTE teacher can cover an academic
class.
The overall fact is, though "VE" has been changed to
"CTE" to provide more acceptability (and perhaps finesse),
it is a viable option for all students (Green, 2012), and the
voluntary sabotaging described in the preceding may have
implications related to the feminization of VE courses, short-
age of CTE teachers and administrators, and the attempts to
comply with NYSED law by trying to circumvent them.
Notwithstanding, as advanced in Green (2012), there is a
need for NYC to establish VE schools for students who are
also gifted in that field. Therefore, more technically compe-
tent, higher educated, and state-licensed VE teachers are
needed. Such requirements are a tenet of NCLB. According
to NCLB, every public school teacher must be highly quali-
fied. "Under the law, `highly qualified' generally meant that
a teacher was certified and demonstrably proficient in his or
her subject matter" ("No Child Left Behind," 2004, para. 7).
The establishment of a gifted vocational program is within
the purview of current District 79's superintendent, Dr. Tim
Lisante, who can make the recommendation to the current
NYC school chancellor, Carmen Fariña. The framework for
a gifted VE high school could be similar to the city's special-
ized high schools for linguistically and logically mathemati-
cally gifted students. However, for that to happen, District 79
must embrace a Type I alternative education framework, as
opposed to a Type II or III.
According to Raywid (1994), Type I includes magnet
schools with high quality programs. Type II offers programs
for students who are too disruptive for regular school and are
being offered a last chance before expulsion. Type III is for
remedial and rehabilitation to allow students to return to their
homeschool. For District 79 to adopt a Type I framework,
stakeholders must apply pressure. The District was over-
hauled in 2007 because many at-risk students--identified by
markers such as poor grades, truancy, pregnancy, and disrup-
tive behavior--were being abandoned in its programs
(Bosman, 2007; Robinson, 2005).
Many NYC children from other parts of the world were
exposed to strong VE programs, as I was exposed as a youth
in Jamaica, West Indies (WI). Based on my 20 years teaching
experience in the United States, students who have previous
VE experience are more likely to activate their prior knowl-
edge and excel at the subject when reintroduced to it.
Therefore, Green (2012) outlined the importance for students
to be exposed to VE at an early age and not when they are 19
years old. At that age, they are mostly sent to be hidden in a
VE program to get them out of academic schools, where the
principals do not want those students'low-performing scores
to negatively affect the (principals') schools' report card
grades. So students may be pushed out of traditional school
in a subtle or overt manner (Lehr & Lange, 2003).
School Size
"School size affects student participation and satisfaction
independent of the effects of SES and academic ability"
(Mickelson & Greene, 2006, para. 6). Most learning was
generated in midsize schools of "600 to 900 students," less in
Green 9
relatively smaller schools, and the least in large schools (Lee
& Smith, 1997, p. 217). The various pathologies and the det-
rimental impact that large schools imposed on students, in
particular low SES students and students of color, were
delineated in numerous studies (Darling-Hammond, 2006;
Darling-Hammond, Ross, & Milliken, 2007). On the con-
trary, small schools had positive impact on such students.
In NYC for example, Manpower Demonstration Research
Corporation (MDRC, 2013) reported, "Findings show that
the [small] schools, which serve mostly disadvantaged stu-
dents of color, continue to produce sustained positive effects
. . ." (para. 1). However, small schools and success were not
an absolute, as a school's success could be a function of the
impact of principal gender (Freigruber, 2009). Ornstein
(1993) found students had higher achievement in larger
schools of "495-1000 students." He also found students in
large schools took more courses compared with those in
small schools. Given the mixed results, this study is
warranted.
The literature justified the need for a study of principal
gender, school performance, and related factors. This study
will contribute to the present body of knowledge by situating
the nation's largest school system in the literature regarding
the impact of principal and student gender on school perfor-
mance. Its approach encourages the inclusion of the point of
view of stakeholders who are fast becoming the new major-
ity, and who seek answers to their questions regarding NYC
school failure, especially the failure of male youth. In addi-
tion, it lays the foundation for future studies to examine the
interactions of race and gender, concentrating on the experi-
ences of Black and Latina principals, as recommended in
Pollard (1997) and Flores (2011).
Method
This study employed five research questions to determine
whether differences in performance/demographic scores
existed in NYC schools based on the interactions of principal
and/or student, gender, or other factors. Publicly available
data were obtained from the NYCDOE (2013a) website con-
taining the 2012-2013 progress report data for all 459 report-
ing high schools, and NYCDOE (2013b) containing the
2012-2013 demographic data for all 1,557 NYC schools. The
merging of data from both sites resulted in 459 high schools
with the requisite data set. To facilitate data analysis, the
schools'performance grades (A, B, C, D, or F) were assigned
numerical values as follows (NCLB grade definitions are
shown in brackets):
·
· A = 4 (schools making excellent progress),
·
· B = 3 (schools making above-average progress),
·
· C = 2 (schools making satisfactory progress),
·
· D = 1 (schools making less than satisfactory prog-
ress), and
·
· F = 0 (schools failing to make adequate progress).
In addition, gender was also assigned a numerical value
(female = 1, male = 2).
Microsoft Excel was used to perform sort functions, cal-
culate mean, percentages for principal and student gender,
and to filter data.
Data Analysis
Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statis-
tics. Excel database was used to perform initial sorting and
filtering functions, while Predictive Analytics
Software (PASW) facilitated statistical analyses. Tests
included ANOVA, independent-sample t test, and a Kruskal­
Wallis.ANOVAs returning significance were further explored
with Levene's test of equality of variance and Tukey's post
hoc. The Kruskal­Wallis was used to facilitate nonparametric
and inferential statistical analysis. Kruskal­Wallis is not
encumbered by strict requirements of mean and variance,
relative to sample size, that is required for parametric analyti-
cal procedures (Green, 2012). Notwithstanding, it has its own
strict requirements. Its use was appropriate because some
independent variables had four or more outcomes, and Staten
Island introduced low sample sizes. The different tests
negated the possibly of Type I error. A Type I error can lead
the researcher to draw erroneous conclusions (Yockley, 2011).
Analysis for Research Question 2 was conducted in three
phases. The first phase incorporated the A, B, C, D, and Fs of
school assessment more familiar to parents, educators, and
other stakeholders. The second, with boxplots, checked
assumptions and obtained a sense of the data, while the third
accommodated in-depth statistical analysis. The approach
was undertaken to help advance the use and/or understanding
of data analysis in stakeholders such as students, parents, and
educators.
Results
Research Question 1: Based on the NYC school perfor-
mance scores (OS and college and career readiness scores
[C&CRS]), is there a significant difference in the school
boroughs' capacity to educate students?
A Kruskal­Wallis explored the question. The result
depicted in Figure 2 indicates significant differences between
the boroughs' OS, 2(4, N = 369) = 11.88, p = .018, with the
highest mean rank of 223.15 for Staten Island compared with
the lowest mean rank of 169.04 for Brooklyn. Significant
differences were also found between the boroughs' C&CRS,
2(4, N = 369) = 26.830, p = .000, with the highest mean rank
of 251 for Staten Island compared with the lowest mean rank
of 155.86 for Brooklyn.
Overall, Staten Island's schools were the highest ranked
for (a) educating NYC students and (b) preparing them for
college. Brooklyn's schools were the lowest rated in both
regards.
10 SAGE Open
Research Question 2: Based on principal gender and
school borough, is there a significant relation in the distri-
bution of the C&CRS NYC schools received?
Phase 1
Table 1 displays the result of a cross-tabulation of the factors
under study. It reveals that of the 100 schools that received
GradeA, the majority had female principals and were located in
Manhattan. Of the schools that received Grades D and F, the
majority had male principals and were located in Bronx (n = 13)
and Brooklyn (n = 18). Based on the data, Manhattan's female
principals generated the most Grade A (n =19). In contrast,
Brooklyn's male principals generated the most Grade F (n = 5).
Phase 2
A boxplot (see Figure 3) reveals Brooklyn female principals
received a few extremely low scores (outliers), but Bronx
and Brooklyn male principals had higher frequencies of out-
liers. Such low scores could indicate skewness and a viola-
tion of the normal distribution and equal variance
requirements for analysis with two-way ANOVA (Weinberg
& Abromowitz, 2008). However, a histogram (see Figure 4)
reveals the appearance of normal distribution; thus, a threat
to my ANOVA was mitigated. In sum, cursory analysis indi-
cates that scores did not vary significantly as a function of
principal gender, but they did as a function of borough.
Phase 3
A two-way between-subject ANOVA with the C&CRS as the
dependent variable and principal gender and NYC borough as
the independent variables (see Table 2) reveals that (a) princi-
pal gender was not significant, F(1, 359) = 0.26, p = .61; (b)
the NYC boroughs, F(4, 359) = 8.01, p < .05, partial 2 = .08,
was significant; and (c) the combination of principal gender
and NYC borough was not significant, F(4, 359) = 1.16,
p = .33.
Overall, principal gender did not make a borough-wide
significant difference in the NYC schools' capacity to pre-
pare students for college or career. However, the data on
NYC borough (p = .00) in Table 2 confirmed that individual
differences existed between the boroughs. How the boroughs
differed from one another was the subject of further
analysis.
In the appendix, pairwise comparison using the multiple
comparisontablegeneratedfromaTukeyHonestlySignificant
Difference (HSD) post hoc reveals that Manhattan against
Brooklyn's scores produce a mean difference of .54 and a p
value of .001. As p is less than .05, Brooklyn's schools were
significantly less capable of preparing students for college or
career compared with Manhattan's schools. A comparison of
Bronx against Queens' scores produces a mean difference of
-.50 and a p value of .015.As p is less than .05, Bronx schools
were significantly less capable of preparing students for col-
lege or career compared with Queens' schools. A comparison
of Brooklyn and Queens' scores produces a mean difference
of -.67 and a p value of .001. As p is less than .05, Brooklyn's
schools were significantly less capable of preparing students
for college or career compared with Queens' schools. The
comparison of Staten Island against Brooklyn's scores pro-
duces a mean difference of .96 and a p value of .027. As p is
less than .05, Brooklyn's schools were significantly less capa-
ble of preparing students for college or career compared with
Staten Island's schools.
Overall, as confirmed by the score (M = 2.44 = Grade C)
in Figure 5, Brooklyn's schools taught by either male or
female principals were the least successful at preparing NYC
students for college or career. Staten Island's schools with
score amounting to Grade A, especially in schools taught by
male principals (no significant differences in principal gen-
der withstanding; t = .552, p >.05), were the most successful
at preparing NYC students for college and career.
Research Question 3: Is there a significant relation
between the college and career readiness scores (C&CRS)
of NYC male students based on percent mean enrollment
and principal gender?
Figure 6 indicates the majority of the city's male students
generated Grade F irrespective of principal gender. In addi-
tion, fewer male students received Grade A, especially those
in schools led by female principals.
A two-way between-subject ANOVA with the percent
male students as the dependent variable and principal gender
and C&CRS as the independent variables facilitated in-depth
analysis. The result in Table 3 reveals as follows: (a) C&CRS
was significant, F(4, 359) = 2.49, p = .043, partial 2 = .027,

Research Question 4: Based on principal gender and
school borough, what can be learned from a comparison
of select demographic factors between NYC highest and
lowest rated schools for preparing students for college or
career?
The result is depicted in Figure 7. The most highly rated
(successful) schools were large (M = 1,701.33), were led by
male principals, and were located in Staten Islands. In con-
trast, the least successful (failed) schools were small
(M = 390), were led by a female principals, and were located
in Manhattan.
The most successful schools with Blacks or Hispanics
(M = 86.60) were led by male principals and were located in
Bronx. In contrast, the least successful (failed) schools with
Blacks or Hispanics (M = 95.64) were led by female princi-
pals and were located in Manhattan.
The most successful schools with male students
(M = 50.52) were led by male principals and were located in
Manhattan. In contrast, the least successful (failed) schools
with male students (M = 23.85) were led by female principals
and were located in Manhattan. The most successful schools
with students with disabilities (M = 21.22) were led by
12 SAGE Open
female principals and were located in Staten Island. In con-
trast, the least successful (failed) schools with students with
disabilities (M = 27.85) were led by male principals and were
located in Bronx.
Overall, the city's largest schools led by male principal
in Staten Island were significantly the most highly rated
(successful) at preparing students for college or career.
They had the least number of Black or Hispanic students,
slightly fewer number of male students, and slightly
above-average students with disability. (Noteworthy:
Black or Hispanic students achieved the highest college or
career preparation scores in large female-led Staten Island
schools.)
The city's smallest schools located in Manhattan and led by
female principals were the lowest rated for preparing students
for college or career. They were 96% Black or Hispanic stu-
dents, had significantly fewer male students (76.15% female
students), and the majority of the students had disabilities. Male
principals in similarly small schools in Bronx and Brooklyn had
equal or worse scores. Common to failed NYC schools in the

based on principal gender and school borough?
The result generated from mean test is outlined in Table 4.
It reveals the following.
Staten Island's male principals had the highest perform-
ing English Language Arts (ELA) students (M = 3.04, SD =
0.36) compared with Bronx female principal lowest
(M = 2.54, SD = 0.25). Staten Island schools also had the
highest performing math students (M = 3.31, SD = 0.52)
compared with Bronx female principal lowest (M = 2.72,
SD = 0.29). Bronx female principal had the highest percent-
age of English language learner (ELL) students (M = 19.61,
SD = 25.32) compared with Staten Island male lowest (M =
2.08, SD = 2.39). Staten Island female principal had the high-
est percentage of students with disabilities (M = 25.10, SD =
4.74) compared with Queens' male principal lowest percent-
age (M = 12.76, SD = 6.57). Bronx male principal had the
highest percentage of Black or Hispanic students (M = 94.15,
SD = 9.78) compared with Staten Island male principal low-
est (M = 30.86, SD = 24.65).
This question did not seek to ascertain significance, but
such information is of relevance to the pending discussion.
Therefore, it is included. As such, the schools led by
Brooklyn male principals generated significantly higher
ELA and math tests scores compared with female-princi-
pal-led schools. In addition, Queens's female principals had
significantly higher percentage of Black and Hispanic stu-
dents compared with the borough's male principals. No
other results were significant. Overall, while Staten Island's
male principals benefited from having the higher perform-
ing students, its female principals had the highest number
of special needs students. The result is manifested in the
discrepancy in scores where Staten Island male-principal-
led schools, with fewer Black students and with fewer indi-
ces of poverty, returned higher scores than schools led by
its female principals.
Discussion
This study used secondary NYC school report card data to
determine whether there were differences in the boroughs'
capacity to educate students; if feminization was occurring,
how it possibly shaped school achievement scores and the
possible implications for male students; whether there were
moderating variables that informed the performance of NYC
schools; and how the characteristics of schools differed
based on principal gender. Overall, principal gender did not
make a borough-wide significant difference in the NYC
schools' capacity to prepare students for college or career.

However, it affected an individual borough. Therefore,
Staten Island male principals were the most successful at
preparing NYC students for college or career. Male or female
principals in Brooklyn's schools were the least successful in
that regard. Female principals led the city's smallest schools,
which concentrated poverty, had more female students, and
were the lowest performing schools.

Asian population (M = 59%). In contrast, Brooklyn had a
lower household income (US$46,085), and its schools had a
majority Black or Hispanic population (M = 86%).
Principal Gender and School Borough, and
Relation to School Performance
Female Manhattan principals generated the most Grade A
(n = 19). In contrast, male principals in Brooklyn generated
the most Grade F (n = 5). In addition, as previously stated,
Staten Island male-principal-led schools were rated the high-
est compared with Brooklyn's male- and female-principal-led
lowest rated schools. The discrepancy was explained by insti-
tutional and situational segregation. In addition, Ett (2008),
Arnold and Doctoroff (2003), and Legewie and Diprete
(2012) aligned school failure with the poverty of various stu-
dents based on gender and other characteristics. This is a key
point because Staten Island schools had the lowest ELL,
Black, or Hispanic students; the lowest poverty levels; as well
as the highest performing math/ELA students.
In regard to poverty, the difference in household income
(US$26,474) between Staten Island and Brooklyn is stark.
However, the lowest income among the boroughs was Bronx at
US$34,388. Such disparity illuminates the possible middle-
class factor outlined in Kahlenberg (2012-2013). He revealed
how socioeconomically integrated schools, irrespective of
locations, were more successful than segregated Black schools.
Staten Island schools were fairly socioeconomically integrated,
while Brooklyn's were highly Black or Hispanic segregated.
Paradoxically, if poverty was a major factor in school per-
formance, Bronx with a household income of US$34,388,
instead of Brooklyn, should be the lowest performing bor-
ough. Coincidentally, Bronx's schools with Black or Hispanic
student populations (M = 92.3%) were the most segregated
of all the boroughs--predicting its failure as per the Coleman
Report. However, the paradox in its better performance than
Brooklyn's performance is explained by the fact that Bronx
had more than twice the percentage of Hispanic or Black and
fewer male students compared with Brooklyn. Nationwide,
Hispanic students now generate higher achievement scores
than Blacks (U.S. DOE, 2014). In addition, male students
generated lower academic scores (Chambers, 2009).
College and Career Readiness Scores, Male
Students Enrollment, and Principal Gender
Principal gender was not a significant factor in the college or
career scores received by male students. However, male stu-
dents received significantly lower number of Grade A college
and career readiness scores compared with female students.
In addition, Brooklyn's male principals had significantly
more male students. Thus, Brooklyn results contradict the lit-
erature (e.g., Addi-Raccah, 2002; Bradley, 2004; Mulvey,
2009; Steffenhagen, 2001) regarding the relation between
feminization and male students' failure. Still, it is no
consolation to parents, and the borough's political leadership,
that Brooklyn, a significant African American community,
was the worst performing school borough in the city. The
basis for the discrepancy may transcend principal gender and
points to other factors in the discussion. However, the numer-
ical majority of the city's schoolteachers were females.
Therefore, if "feminized" pedagogical practices were a factor
in male students'lower school performance, it would be inde-
pendent of principal gender (male and female principals will
have more female teachers compared with males).
Notwithstanding, as previously noted, feminized pedagogical
practices would be incompatible with boys' socialization and
learning styles (Martino & Kehler, 2006).
Beyond feminization is the racial component, wherein the
majority of NYC principals were White middle-class
females, and the majority of students were low SES Black
and Hispanic and males. Pollard (1997) spoke of the need to
examine the interactions of race and gender as this is a criti-
cal issue not covered well in the literature. Principals' role
modeling to, interaction with, and understanding of students
and their cultures can enhance success for both groups
(Anthony, 2008; Ett, 2008; Graham & Erwin, 2011; Green,
2012). Importantly, the NYSED and the Regents identified
the need for diversity in the state's school leadership cadre.
Regents (NYSED, 1998) reveals,
We need to recruit from a more diverse talent pool when we look
for school leaders. At least that is the impression one gets in
looking over the crowd at many of the Leadership Forums. This
is part of the problem, and part of the opportunity before us. It
must be made a high priority. (para. 8)
Graham and Erwin (2011) supported Secretary of
Education Duncan's assessment implicating the pathology of
employment discrimination facing Black teachers as a root
cause for the dearth of Black school administrators. Karpinski
(2006) revealed how the dearth of Black principals contrib-
uted to the current failure of Black males.
Principal Gender, School Borough, and
Characteristics of Schools at the Highest and
Lowest Performance Levels
The findings here indicate that large male-principal-led
schools (M = 2,180), with majority White and Asian student
population of practically equal gender, in the majority White-
populated Staten Island school borough returned the highest
scores for preparing the city's youth for college and careers.
This result is inconsistent with the findings of MDRC's
(2013), linked to the Gates Foundation, that touted the higher
success of small NYC schools serving Black or Hispanic and
disabled students. It offers a rival hypothesis that asserts that
the city's small school initiative of shuttering large failed
schools and converting them to smaller more expensive ones
highlight an issue of major significance to NYC schools.
Green 17
To further refute other findings, medium size schools (M =
516) led by female principals in the majority White-populated
borough of Manhattan, with the third lowest Black and
Hispanic student population, were also found to be more
effective at preparing NYC students for college or career.
Mickelson and Greene (2006) reported on the higher success
of medium size schools. In contrast, small male- or female-
principal-led majority Black or Hispanic schools in the city's
largest White-populated borough--Brooklyn (more than
twice the White population of Staten Island)--were the least
successful. Highlighting the racial/ethnic population of the
boroughs is key because four of the five boroughs are major-
ity Whites, yet the most integrated one (Staten Island)--with
majority White students--attained the highest success. This
was also true for the second highest integrated borough,
Queens, whose schools attained the second highest perform-
ing scores of all the boroughs. Therefore, socioeconomically
integrating NYC schools could improve their performance.
Socioeconomically integrating NYC schools avoids the
dilemma in desegregating the city's failing schools.
According to Kahlenberg (2012-2013), bussing and other
methods of forced desegregation, now being overturned by
the Supreme Court, were ineffective. Therefore, NYC alter-
native initiative to improve its schools by restructuring large
failed ones into smaller ones is supported by Kahlenberg.
However, he asserts that the new schools must be socioeco-
nomically integrated, which can also be achieved through the
creation of magnet schools to attract middle-class students.
Therefore, merely converting large schools to smaller ones
would not assure success (Lee & Smith, 1997; Schneider,
Wyse, & Keesler, 2007).
The Select Characteristics of Schools Based on
Principal Gender and School Borough
The city's smallest schools led by female principals in
Manhattan were the lowest rated for preparing students for col-
lege or career. The schools enrolled 96% Black or Hispanic
students, had significantly fewer male students (76.15% female
students), and the majority of the students had disabilities. The
pathological outcomes of (a) school segregation, (b) concentra-
tion of poverty, (c) the warehousing of students with special
needs, and those who received the lowest scores on NYS's
eighth-grade ELA and math tests were demonstrated. Those
factors were found to be significantly associated with failing
NYC schools. The issue of the new state requirements for spe-
cial needs student was thoroughly discussed, and the pathology
of their warehousing was discussed in Lehr and Lange (2003).
In this study, female principals' wish to be associated with
challenged students is in keeping with Durrah (2009) and Eagly
etal. (1992). However, the failing schools they led here, with
majority Black or Hispanic female students, were almost like
single-gender schools. Their dismal failure was not what stake-
holders envisioned in their support for small single-gender
schools, as revealed in Chambers (2009) and Harris (2009).
The question is whether female administrators, especially
Black and Latina, have a choice in accepting schools with chal-
lenged students. Are such schools and students stepping stone
for experience and later move to better positions?
To ensure that NYC school failure is not being ascribed to
female principals, it must be pointed out that male principals
in similarly small schools in Bronx and Brooklyn had com-
parable scores. In addition and in contrast, Staten Island male
principals had insignificant number of ELL students.
Therefore, failure could be attributed to the attitudes and per-
ceptions of educators, as it could be to factors in students'
homes or in their early education. The basis for such state-
ment is evident in the disparate scores generated when the
state's third-grade students are first exposed to high-stake
ELA and math test. The result shows Asians, Whites, Native
Americans, Latinos, and then Blacks in order of highest to
lowest rankings (NYSED, 2015).
Conclusion
Principal leadership, which entails guidance for administrative
staff, community outreach, and public relations, affects both
teachers' effectiveness and students' performance. Therefore,
it is critical that principals receive support and are provided
with needed resources. Principals must have the flexibility
needed to mediate between schools and their various public
stakeholders such as parents, teachers, and students.
As our demographic shift unfolds, schools and their com-
munities will become more diverse. Therefore, principals
must act to include all vested members of the school com-
munity and to develop ways to address their concerns
(Piraino, 2009). Similar to how the failure of the nation's
schools is a pressing concern of NCLB, as reaffirmed by the
Obama administration (U.S. DOE, 2015), the failure of
Black male students is a pressing concern among many New
York residents, demanding attention from the city's high
school principals.4 This study provides a way for NYC prin-
cipals to navigate the complexity of the problem and respond
to their various communities with answers that are research
based. The following reiterates some important findings:
·
· Staten Island's male-principal-led schools were the
highest rated at preparing NYC students for college or
careers. The schools were large and majority Whites;
they had the highest math and ELA scoring students.
The relevance of this result speaks to the impact of socio-
economic integration as a means to improve the city's
schools.
·
· Brooklyn's highly Black or Hispanic segregated schools
led by either male or female principals were rated the
lowest at preparing NYC students for college or careers.
18 SAGE Open
The relevance of this result speaks to the need to address
a looming problem, where students comprising the
nations' minority­majority are not being properly edu-
cated, especially in the areas of science, technology, engi-
neering, and math (STEM). This pathology bespeaks a
looming national security crisis, wherein the groups his-
torically receive the least number of STEM degrees. The
Department of Defense is concerned that, in the next
decade, there will not be enough STEM graduates to
replace its aging STEM workforce. In addition, to have
Brooklyn, the de facto Black capital of the world (Shipp,
1991), seen internationally as a borough of academically
challenged Blacks, is not befitting of the borough of kings.
·
· The city's male students received significantly more
Grade F for college or career preparedness. They also
constituted the lowest overall percentage of enrollees
in the city's highest performing schools. The rele-
vance of this result speaks to the need to address the
continued failure of male students. VE can address the
problem, but its current misuse as a dumping ground
is reminiscent of a past practice, where poor male stu-
dents were housed in special schools for physically
and mentally handicapped children (Ett, 2008). In
addition, evidence of the feminization of VE courses
does not augur well for male students who need the
dynamic and mobile learning environment.
·
· The city's large, followed by its medium, schools
were the highest performing, whereas its small schools
were the lowest performing.
The relevance of this result speaks to the need to reexam-
ine the city's small school policy, where large schools are
been converted to smaller more expensive ones. Large
failing schools converted to small schools with the same
failed students will amount to the concentration of failure
and poverty in more schools. For the conversion to work,
schools must adopt socioeconomic integration, also
achievable through magnet schools.
Other important findings are stated below without elabo-
ration. They are stated to generate a conversation between
educators, parents and their children, stakeholders, their
schools, and their political leaders.
·
· Queens' female principals had significantly more
Black or Hispanic students compared with the bor-
ough's male principals.
·
· Brooklyn's male-principal-led schools generated sig-
nificantly higher math/ELA scores compared with the
borough's female-principal-led schools.
·
· The city's female principals had more special needs
students compared with male principals.
·
· Staten Island's female principals had the highest per-
centage of students with disabilities, whereas Queens'
male principals had the lowest percentage.
·
· Bronx's male principals had the highest percentage of
Black or Hispanic students, whereas Staten Island had
the lowest.
·
· Queen's schools were the second highest performing
and, like Staten Island's schools, were reasonably
socioeconomically integrated.
A major finding generated from my qualitative analysis of
the school report card data used in this study is that schools
with more Asian students attained higher performance
scores. In addition, Asians along with Whites were key com-
ponents of the success of the city's socioeconomically inte-
grated schools. Therefore, it is of great importance to
compare the third-grade ELA and math scores of all racial/
ethnic student groups to pinpoint where school success or
school failure begins. Third grade is where public school stu-
dents take their first state assessment test.
This study emanated from Pollard's (1997) and Flores's
(2011) recommendations for further studies on the topic, and
it lays the foundation for the future examination of the expe-
riences of Black, Hispanic, male, female, and other NYC
principals. It illuminated issues of educational significance
that will be taking center stage as the race to improve the
nation's schools to educate the emerging "minority­major-
ity" becomes a matter of national security. It informs the
need for stakeholders in the various boroughs, especially
Brooklyn, to demand accountability, and for the state to scru-
tinize alternative schools/programs, as it moves to effectively
implement the CDOS program.
The findings, in part, reveal a link between the capacity of
NYC schools to prepare students for college or careers, prin-
cipals and students' gender, poverty indices, how the bor-
oughs with their different socioeconomic levels performed,
and how complex the problem is. It highlights the need for
forward-thinking policy decisions also focused on improving
the educational outcome for both male and special needs stu-
dents, as well as critically examining the effectiveness of the
city's small school initiative, and its VE programs. However,
a limitation is this study only elicited input from three school
administrators. One, Dr. Michael Wiltshire, related how his
Caribbean roots and his shared culture with his students
enabled his school to be highly successful. Another adminis-
trator highlighting the racism and discrimination he faces,
and an administrator who is surreptitiously and overtly chang-
ing a prime VE school into a dumping ground for lower per-
forming students, as a means to accommodate the dumping of
students being undertaken by academic school principals.
The data the principal presented to staff at the commence-
ment of the 2015 school year revealed the significant increas-
ing number of special needs students from District 75, which
is responsible for educating the city's special needs students.
Additional data he presented revealed that it cost the school
more than US$100,000 a year to educate one student com-
pared with the approximately US$16,000 a year it costs for
the average NYC school. Are taxpayers and students being
Green 19
adequately served? Such answers can be determined by
NYSED scrutiny and future research.
Recommendations
The findings of this study recommend mindful examination
of NYC school staffing to gauge the impact of possible femi-
nization of the educational opportunities of both male and
female students and how the lack of male role models affects
both groups. In addition, it supports the call for more Black
and Hispanic administrators, culturally relevant and respon-
sive mentoring, and other resources to help principals
improve performance outcomes for underperforming stu-
dents, especially Black and Hispanic youth. It also recom-
mends the establishment of gifted and talented VE schools,
and an examination to determine whether VE schools were
being used as dumping grounds for special needs and other
low-performing students.
Given the difficulties associated with preparing the data, it
is also recommended that principals' gender and the number
of male and female teachers should be included in the schools'
demographic data, and that the enrollment data for high
schools (9th-12th grades) should be disaggregated from the
lower grades of schools that serve a K-12, or similar popula-
tion. Finally, the findings indicate that future mixed-methods
studies explore variables such as educators' attitudes and per-
ception in a post majority White school, students' country of
origin, especially in the light of literature revealing immigrant
students, including those from countries such as Jamaica,
Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Barbados, and some countries
in Africa, outperform native Black students (Green, 2012).

Notes
1. Such practices required parental and community involvement
to ensure that all students, regardless of their different pheno-
types, were accorded equal opportunity for quality education
from caring educators.
2. Blacks benefited from Whites' discussions about attending
college and about their parents' careers.
3. More female teachers are now teaching, as the program has
evolved from its founding strict vocational trades theme.
4. Because of the numerous compromises President Obama
offered to school districts, some, mistakenly, believe that
under his administration, No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) is
not the guiding force in American education. However, it is the
force that compels schools to improve or be reorganized.
