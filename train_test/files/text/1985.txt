ABSTRACT
Objectives Although occupational noise is a well
known risk factor for hearing loss, little epidemiological
evidence has been reported on its association with
hearing loss in the general population, in part, because of
the difficulty in exposure assessment. This study
introduced a quantitative occupational noise exposure
assessment tool using the Occupational Information
Network (O*NET) database and evaluated its
applicability for epidemiological research using data from
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999e2004.
Methods The O*NET noise exposure data were
assessed by questionnaires across numerous
occupations, asking the frequency of exposure to sounds
and noise levels that are distracting and uncomfortable
(with five possible responses from `never' to `every day').
Means of the O*NET noise scores were computed to
correspond to NHANES occupational categories and
assigned to 3828 adults aged 20e69 years, who
participated in the 1999e2004 NHANES. Pure-tone
averages (PTA) of hearing thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and
4 kHz were computed, and hearing loss was defined as
a PTA >25 dB in either ear. Linear and logistic
regression models with either continuous or quintiles of
the O*NET noise scores were fitted on log-transformed
PTA and binary hearing loss, respectively.
Results Noise scores ranged from 1.80 to 4.37 with
mean6SE of 3.0660.02. After controlling for potential
confounders, the highest (vs lowest) noise score quintile
had a 22.5% (95% CI 11.0% to 35.2%) increase in PTA,
and there was a linear dose-dependent trend across the
quintiles of noise scores (p trend<0.0001). The adjusted
OR for hearing loss comparing the highest with the
lowest noise score quintiles was 2.1 (95% CI 1.2 to 3.6).
Conclusion This study suggests that the O*NET noise
score is a useful tool for examining occupational noise-
induced health effects in the general population in the
absence of actual occupational noise exposure
assessment data.
INTRODUCTION
Hearing loss is one of the leading chronic health
disabilities experienced by older adults.1 More than
35 million Americans aged 18 years and older suffer
from hearing loss, and the number of people with
hearing loss tends to increase dramatically with
advancing age.2 In addition to ageing, noise is one
of the most important determinants of hearing
loss. While hearing loss could occur purely by noise
induction, it usually occurs from a combination of
different factors.
Occupational noise exposure has been associated
with hearing loss, especially among workers with
high noise exposure levels.3e7 Approximately 16%
of hearing impairment worldwide is attributed to
occupational noise.7e9 In the USA, about 5e30
million workers are exposed to noise levels at work
that put them at risk of hearing loss.10
Hearing loss can be diagnosed through review of
an audiogram, regardless of whether the hearing
loss is caused by noise or other factors, such as
ageing.11 12 Noise-induced hearing loss usually
begins at 3, 4 or 6 kHz (higher frequencies). With
noise-induced hearing loss, thresholds at these
frequencies are higher (indicating hearing loss) than
at that of 0.5 and 1 kHz (lower frequencies) and at
8 kHz (recovery), which is named a noise notch.12 13
In contrast, the audiogram of age-related hearing
loss shows substantial down-sloping (higher
thresholds) in higher frequencies.11 13 The associa-
tion between noise exposure and noise notch allows
us to observe the distinct effect of noise exposure on
noise-induced hearing loss while excluding the
effect of changes in hearing ability by other factors.
Although previous epidemiological studies have
consistently shown a positive association between
occupational noise exposure and hearing loss, few
studies have been able to measure cumulative
personal noise exposure in the general population.

between occupational noise estimated using
this new assessment tool and hearing impair-
ment in the US general population.

Exposure assessment
Occupation and/or industry classifications can be used through
job-exposure matrix (JEM),14 15 and several studies conducted in
the USA and Europe reported an association between JEM-
estimated noise exposure and hearing loss.6 8 16 However, such
JEMs are limited to occupations and industries with high noise
exposures, which preclude studies of the health effect of occu-
pational noise exposure in the general population.
Recent studies have reported that the Occupational Infor-
mation Network (O*NET) has the potential to serve as JEM for
selected environmental factors, applying it to national health
surveys to examine associations with health outcomes.17 18 This
study used the O*NET database as a surrogate measure for
occupational noise exposure estimates. The O*NET is the
survey-based database system generated by the US Department
of Labor providing information on skills, abilities, knowledge,
work activities and interests across occupational groups.19 Data
were collected through questionnaires from employees selected
in every occupation group coded as the Standardized Occupa-
tion Codes (SOC) and were scored by mean scales in each SOC
group. Because a question about occupational noise exposure is
included in the questionnaire, mean scores of such a question
may provide quantitative measures of occupational noise expo-
sure in all occupation groups, those occupations with high noise
exposure as well as those with low exposure. This allows us to
evaluate the potential health effects of noise within various
occupational groups of the general population. An important
limitation of this approach is the fact that it cannot be validated
as a method of assessing occupational exposure without being
compared to direct measurements of workplace noise in each
occupation. Nonetheless, if the O*NET noise estimates have
a significant association with hearing loss in a well-defined
population with a wide range of occupation groups, the
applicability of this method may be confirmed.
The aims of this study were to introduce a quantitative
occupational noise exposure assessment tool using O*NET and
to evaluate its applicability using data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999e2004 in
the general US population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
O*NET noise exposure assessment
The O*NET is a publicly available on-line database that describes
occupational features across SOC taxonomy. This study used the
recent version `O*NET 12.0' available at the O*NET website
(http://www.onetcenter.org/database.html#download) or the
National Crosswalk Service Center (http://www.xwalkcenter.
org). We extracted the data of the occupational noise scale scores
as the element name `Sounds, Noise Levels are Distracting, etc'
(element ID IV.C.2.b.1.a) across 801 SOC groups. Occupational
noise exposure was scored by frequency-type answers to the
question, `In your current job, how often are you exposed to
sounds and noise levels that are distracting and uncomfort-
able?'.20 Five responses are possible, `never (1)', `once a year or
more but not every month (2)', `once a month or more but not
every week (3)', `once a week or more but not every day (4)' and
`every day (5)'.21 An example of the O*NET database structure
(O*NET SOC code, noise estimates, SE and survey sample size)
is presented in supplemental table 1. We used the mean of
responses in each 801 SOC occupation as a proxy measure of
occupational noise exposure. For example, the category
`accountants' (SOC: 13-2011.01) has the mean score of 1.49
(SE¼0.24), whereas the category `construction carpenters' (SOC:
47-2031.01) has 4.17 (SE¼0.26). If the score is closer to 5, most
workers in that job category are exposed daily to `distracting and
uncomfortable noise levels'. Likewise, if the score is close to 1,
workers in that category are almost never exposed to such noise
levels. The mean O*NET noise scores, therefore, represent the
probability of a worker in a certain job category being exposed to
`distracting and uncomfortable sounds and noise' and do not
reflect the loudness of sound wave (such as decibels).
Application of the O*NET noise estimates to a hearing loss study
Study population
The NHANES, conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) since the early 1960s, is an ongoing series of
cross-sectional surveys designed to assess health and nutritional
status in the civilian non-institutionalised US population.
In NHANES 1999e2004, half of the subjects aged
20e69 years were randomly selected to participate in the Audi-
ometry Examination Component. Subjects were excluded if
they used hearing aids that were not able to be removed for
testing or had sufficient ear pain at the time of the examination
that they could not tolerate headphones.22 The eligible sample
size was 5742 participants: 1807 in 1999e2000, 2046 in
2001e2002 and 1889 in 2003e2004.
Audiometric measures
Audiometry examination was performed in a sound-isolated
room in the mobile examination centre by health technicians
trained by a National Institute for Occupational Safety and
Health-certified audiologist. Instrumentation for the Audiometry
Component included an Interacoustics Model AD226 audiom-
eter with standard TDH-39 headphones and EtymoticEar Tone
3A insert earphones.22 Pure-tone air conduction hearing thresh-
olds were obtained on both ears at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6
and 8 kHz across an intensity range of À10 to 120 dB. Partici-
pants with missing value at one or more frequencies were
excluded from analysis. Procedural details in collecting the
audiometric data have been described elsewhere.22 23
We computed hearing thresholds (decibels) at speech
frequencies as a pure-tone average (PTA) of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz
and the hearing thresholds at high frequencies as a pure-tone
average (high PTA) of 3, 4 and 6 kHz.24 According to classifica-
tion by the WHO, hearing loss is defined as PTA greater than
25 dB in either ear.24 25 Noise notch was defined as the hearing
threshold at 3, 4 and/or 6 kHz at least 10 dB greater than at 1 or
2 kHz and at least 10 dB greater than at 6 or 8 kHz.11 12
Of the initial sample of 5742 participants eligible for inclusion
in the audiometry examination, 324 (6%) were excluded from
the analysis because a test was not performed at all and 152
(3%) were excluded because tests have missing values at one or
more frequencies. As an additional measure of reliability of
participant responses, all audiograms tested the 1 kHz frequency
twice in each ear.22 Three participants were excluded because
there was >10 dB difference between the 1 kHz testeretest
thresholds.24 An additional 452 participants were excluded
because of unilateral hearing loss defined as >10 dB difference
between the PTAs of left and right ears. Therefore, audiometric
results for 4811 participants were included for analysis in the
present study.
Occupational noise estimates
Participant occupation information was obtained from the
occupation questionnaire, which contains personal interview
data on employment and variables relating to the work envi-
ronment, such as workplace noise exposure history.26 We used
the participant's longest job as a measure of past noise exposure.
The longest job information was obtained by asking the
Occup Environ Med 2012;69:176e183. doi:10.1136/oem.2011.064758 177
Exposure assessment
question directly: `What kind of work were you doing the
longest?'.27 Occupation data were then coded by trained coders
using the US Census Bureau's Census 1990 or 2000 indexes of
occupation, which are the three-digit NCHS Occupational
Classification Source Codes.28 In the publicly available NHANES
data, these codes were collapsed into 41 occupation categories.27
Of the 4811 participants with available audiometric measure-
ments, 4547 had information available on their longest
jobd2498 participants who answered their longest job plus an
additional 2049 participants who answered their longest job
were the same as their current job and for whom the current job
code was assigned as their longest job. To link the O*NET noise
estimates to the 41 occupation categories, we grouped the 801
O*NET SOCs available into the corresponding NHANES occu-
pation categories and computed the averages of the O*NET noise
scores in each category. Because military occupations were not
included in the O*NETsurvey, we could not generate an O*NET
noise score for the military occupation group and so resulted in
40 occupation groups for analysis. After linking O*NET noise
estimates to occupation categories, we assigned an average noise
score to each participant. Of the 4547 participants with available
longest job information, we excluded 66 participants whose
longest jobs were not coded to any of the 41 occupation groups
and 59 participants who had military occupation, yielding 4422
participants available for statistical analyses.
We also computed the weighted averages of O*NET noise
scores for the 40 NHANES occupation groups, accounting for the
SEs of the noise scores in each O*NET SOC group and which
reflect the precision of the O*NETsurvey data (see supplemental
table 1). Because SEs were not available for 58 of the 801 SOCs, we
used the unweighted averages as our primary index of occupa-
tional noise and examined the weighted ones as a sensitivity
analysis. The unweighted and weighted average O*NETscores for
40 occupation categories are presented in table 1.

Exposure assessment
The characteristics between participants with and without
the longest job information were similar in terms of prevalence
of hearing loss, age, body mass index (BMI) and the status
of hypertension and diabetes. Compared to included partici-
pants, excluded participants were less likely to be male, non-
Hispanic white and smokers, less educated, and less exposed to
occupational noise (see supplemental table 2).
Demographic and hearing-related variables
Other demographic and hearing-related variables were obtained
from the NHANES questionnaires. BMI was calculated as
weight in kilograms/height in metres squared (missing for 49
participants). Use of ototoxic medication was counted when
participants reported medications of aminoglycoside, loop
diuretics, antineoplastic drugs or non-steroidal anti-inflamma-
tory drugs (missing for five participants). Smoking pack-years
were computed and grouped into non-smokers, smokers who
smoked <20 pack-years or smokers who smoked >20 pack-years
(missing for 392 participants). Hypertension was defined as self-
reported physician diagnosis, use of antihypertensive medica-
tion, systolic blood pressure $140 mm Hg or diastolic blood
pressure $90 mm Hg at the time of examination (missing for
189 participants). Diabetes mellitus was defined as those who
self-reported either previous physician diagnosis or use of anti-
hyperglycemic medication (missing for two participants). Non-
occupational noise exposures were determined by audiometry
questionnaires asking if the subject had ever been exposed
outside of work to the noise of a firearm for a mean of at least
once a month for 1 year (missing for five participants) and if the
subject had ever been exposed outside of work to loud noise
(eg, power tools or loud music) for a mean of at least once
a month for 1 year (missing for six participants). Socioeconomic
status, such as education attainment, may be a potential
confounder, but we did not consider it because education is
highly correlated with job title used for our O*NET noise esti-
mates, and controlling for such a socioeconomic status may
result in over adjustment for our exposure effect.
Our study sample was limited to adults who had complete
information on these important covariates, and therefore, a total
of 3828 participants were available for data analyses.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS survey
procedures (SAS V.9.2) and the Rsurvey package (R V.2.9.1) to
account for the complex survey design of the NHANES.1 29
Sample weights for the combined 6-year sample were used as per
NCHS recommendations in order to provide annual national
estimates, which accounted for the unequal probabilities of
selection due to over sampling and non-response.24
Linear regressions were used for continuous hearing thresholds
in each frequency and PTA. Hearing threshold outcomes were
log-transformed to normalise distributions. Eighty subjects
(2.1%) with better-than-normal hearing had zero or negative
hearing thresholds. We excluded these subjects to better interpret
regression results of log-transformed thresholds in our primary
linear regression analyses. Linear regressions including all avail-
able subjects were considered in sensitivity analyses to evaluate
the effect of the exclusion. In sensitivity analyses, a constant 6
was added before log-transformation to make all hearing
threshold values positive and the resulting data as normal as
possible. We examined the O*NET noise score as a continuous
variable and in quintiles. For the latter, we tested for linear trend
across quintiles using ordinal terms. For dichotomous hearing loss
and noise notch outcomes, we determined the OR and 95% CI
using logistic regression models. In multiple regression analyses,
we identified a priori those covariates that needed to be
controlled for, based on biological consideration and the current
state of the literature: age (years), sex, race/ethnicity, BMI
(kilograms per square metre), cigarette smoking (pack-years),
ototoxic medication, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, firearm
noise exposure and recreation noise exposure.30 We fit age and
age-squared to capture non-linear effects of age. To identify
influence of potential confounders, we developed sequential
models: (1) age, sex and race/ethnicity adjusted; (2) additionally
adjusted for BMI, ototoxic medication, cigarette smoking, current
diagnosis of hypertension and current diagnosis of diabetes and
(3) additionally adjusted for recreational noise and firearm noise
exposures. We examined subgroup analyses by age, sex and
race/ethnicity to identify the most susceptible subpopulations.
RESULTS
O*NET noise exposure assessment
Table 1 shows the unweighted and weighted averages of O*NET
noise scores by 40 occupation groups. `Private household occu-
pations' had the lowest noise score in both unweighted (1.80)
and weighted averages (2.02), whereas `extractive and precision
production occupations' and `other transportation and material
moving occupations' were highest in unweighted (4.37) and
weighted (4.63) averages, respectively. We used the unweighted
scores in all subsequent analyses.
Application to hearing loss study
General characteristics
Table 2 shows descriptive characteristics of study participants.
Overall, 456 subjects (11.9%) had a mild or greater hearing loss.
After accounting for sampling weights, cluster and strata of the
NHANES complex design, the mean of O*NET noise scores in
the entire population was 3.06 (SE¼0.02), and subjects with
hearing loss had a significantly higher noise score than those
without hearing loss (3.26 (SE¼0.04) vs 3.04 (SE¼0.02)). The
means of O*NETscores in the entire population and for subjects
with and without hearing loss which were not considered
sampling weights were 3.09 (SD¼0.60), 3.26 (SD¼0.65) and 3.07
(SD¼0.59), respectively. Distributions of the O*NET noise
scores in the NHANES participants are shown in supplemental
figure 1. Subjects with hearing loss were older (54.8 vs
40.4 years), more likely to be male (66% vs 46%), non-Hispanic
white (80% vs 71%) and ever smoker (59% vs 46%), used
ototoxic medication (24% vs 15%), less educated (percentage of
greater than high school diploma 43% vs 60%), more likely to be
exposed to occupational noise (45% vs 32%) and firearm noise
(13% vs 7%), and more likely to have hypertension (43% vs 21%)
and diabetes (12% vs 3%) than those without hearing loss.
Table 3 presents the distributions of participant characteristics
by quintiles of the O*NET noise scores. Subjects with higher
occupational noise were more likely to be male and of race/
ethnicity other than non-Hispanic white, more likely to have
higher hearing thresholds, less educated and more likely to be
exposed to firearm and recreational noises than those with lower
occupational noise.
Occupational noise exposure and hearing thresholds
Table 4 shows per cent changes in PTA in associations with the
O*NETscore as a continuous variable and in quintiles in various
covariate-adjusted models. An increase in occupational noise
exposure either as a continuous variable or in quintiles was
significantly associated with higher (poorer) hearing thresholds.
In the fully adjusted model (model C), subjects in the highest

Exposure assessment
noise quintile had 22.5% (95% CI 11.0% to 35.2%) higher
hearing thresholds than those in the lowest quintile. A unit
increase in the O*NET noise score was associated with a 15.4%
(95% CI 9.7% to 21.5%) increase in hearing thresholds in the
fully adjusted model. The same trends were also observed in
high PTA (see supplemental table 3) and all individual frequen-
cies (see supplemental figure 2). Table 4 was designed to show
results from the linear regression of log-transformed PTA with
the O*NET score, which excludes the subjects with zero and
negative hearing thresholds (2.09%) for better interpretation of
log-transformation. Supplemental table 4, panel A versus B.,
compares results in subjects with only positive hearing thresh-
olds with results in all available subjects. Panel A was designed to
show results from the linear regression of log-transformed (PTA
+6) with the O*NET score in all available subjects, whereas
panel B was designed to show results from the linear regression
of log-transformed (PTA+6) with the O*NET score in subjects
with only positive hearing thresholds, the same subjects as

table 4. From the comparison of supplemental table 4, panel A
versus B, linear regression in subjects with only positive hearing
thresholds showed consistent patterns to those of linear
regression in all available subjects.
Occupational noise exposure and hearing loss and noise notch
Table 5, panel A, shows the association between O*NET noise
score and the risk of hearing loss in different covariate-adjusted
models. There were significant dose-dependent relationships in
all models, and further adjustment for potential confounders
including ototoxic medication, cigarette smoking, hypertension,
diabetes, recreation noise and firearm noise did not change the
result. The fully adjusted OR for hearing loss comparing
the highest versus the lowest quintiles was 2.07 (95% CI 1.18
to 3.63).
Table 5, panel B, shows OR for risk of the noise notch by
quintiles of O*NET noise score. The association showed
a statistically significant dose-dependent relationship, and the
increase pattern in the risk of noise notch in association with
O*NET noise score explains better the dose-dependent rela-
tionship between occupational noise and hearing loss than that
in the OR of the risk of hearing loss by the O*NET noise score in
panel A. The fully adjusted OR for noise notch comparing the
highest versus the lowest quintiles was 1.51 (95% CI 1.09 to
2.09).
As a sensitivity analysis, we also examined associations with
the weighted O*NET noise scores. Overall, associations were
similar to those with unweighted scores (supplemental tables 5
and 6).
Effect of occupational noise at participants' subgroups
We examined the association of the O*NET noise score,
modelled as a continuous variable, with PTA in the subgroups by
important demographic characteristics such as sex, age and race/
ethnicity. The association was strongest among the age group of
40e59 years, whereas it was less significant among the age
group over 60 years. Men or non-Hispanic white also had higher
O*NET noise-associated PTAs than did women or other race/
ethnic groups (see supplemental table 7).
DISCUSSION
The present study introduces a new occupational noise exposure
assessment tool using the O*NET database, evaluating its
applicability to an examination of noise-related adverse health

Exposure assessment
effects in the general population using hearing loss, a well-
established noise-induced health outcome.
Our findings suggest that the use of O*NET scores may
provide enough variation in the proxy measure of occupational
noise exposure so that it can be applied for the general popula-
tion with a wide range of occupation groups. It should be noted
that this study did not attempt to validate the O*NET scores as
a surrogate for personal occupational noise exposure levels.
Rather, we evaluated an applicability of the O*NET scores as
a proxy measure in association with occupational noise-related
health effects in the general population, given available job title
information. We found a significant doseeresponse relationship
of O*NET noise scores with hearing loss and noise notch in
NHANES, confirming that O*NET scores would be useful for
examining noise-related health effects in the absence of personal
occupational noise exposure data. Our results also extend
evidence of noise-induced hearing loss in workers with
extremely high noise exposure to the general population with
low noise exposure, reinforcing occupational noise as an
important risk factor for hearing loss. We found that men, non-
Hispanic white and the age group of 40e59 years were more
susceptible to occupational noise-associated hearing loss than
other groups.
In fact, we ran regression analyses dealing with O*NETscores
as a continuous variable and estimated the b coefficients corre-
sponding to a one-unit increase in O*NET scores. The OR for
risk of hearing loss corresponding to a one-unit increase in
O*NETscores (range between 1 and 5) was 1.65 (95% CI 1.28 to
2.13) in a multivariable-adjusted model. A significant dose-
dependent relationship with O*NET scores was retained in
sequential models after adjusting for socioeconomic factors,
non-occupational noise exposures and other potential risk
factors. This suggests that the association between occupational
noise exposure and hearing loss is independent of such risk
factors. This increased risk is roughly equivalent to 20 or more
pack-years of smoking (OR¼1.54), diabetes (OR¼1.66) and
recreational noise exposure (OR¼1.62) (see supplemental table
8). The estimated effect size of O*NET score is also similar
to the effects of 5 years of ageing (OR¼1.69) when age is fit
linearly.
It is difficult to compare our findings to other studies because
there are no studies of doseeresponse relationship between
occupational noise exposure and hearing loss in the general
population with low to high exposure as a continuous variable.
A few previous investigations of noise and hearing loss have
been made across crude occupational groups in the general
population. In one such study, over 3500 older adults in Beaver
Dam, Wisconsin, were examined for hearing loss in six occupa-
tion categories. A statistically significant increased risk of
hearing loss was found in service (OR¼1.85, 95% CI 1.40 to
2.43), operations/fabricators (OR¼1.99, 95% CI 1.53 to 2.59)
and production (OR¼3.48, 95% CI 2.53 to 4.79) compared to
management as a reference group.6 Another study mailed
a questionnaire over 22 000 adults of working age across Britain
and examined the association between years worked in a noisy
job and self-reported hearing difficulty. That study found an
increase in hearing difficulty by years worked in a noisy job and
a statistically significant increased risk of hearing loss in
5e10 years (prevalence ratio¼3.0, 95% CI 1.5 to 6.1) and over
10 years (prevalence ratio ¼3.8, 95% CI, 2.4 to 6.2) compared to
non-exposed group.16 Our findings are broadly compatible with
these studies and confirm the evidence of increased risk of
hearing loss with increase in occupational noise exposure in the
general population.
In addition to its relationship with hearing loss, the O*NET
occupational noise score had a strong dose-dependent relation-
ship with noise notch. The presence of noise notch is one
diagnostic in determining that hearing loss is noise induced
rather than the effect by other factors such as ageing.11 12 The
ORs of the risk of noise notch increased also gradually across the
O*NET noise score quintiles (ORs 1 (Reference), 0.96, 0.79, 1.35
and 1.51). This suggests that the O*NET occupational noise
could be a good proxy for occupational noise exposure.
The main strengths of this study include (1) the use of
representative samples of the US general population, including
over sampled minority populations, which enables the observed
results to be generalisable; (2) the adjustment for various
potential confounding factors of the association between occu-
pational noise and hearing loss, especially noise exposure other
than workplace noise, such as firearm and recreational noise, and
use of ototoxic medication and (3) the use of NHANES data
conducted with strict quality control procedures.
This study has several limitations that should be considered.
Because the O*NET database we used is based on the frequency
of exposure to sounds and noise levels considered distracting and
uncomfortable rather than on actual noise measurements,
exposure misclassification may exist. Moreover, the O*NET data
are classified only by occupation groups and do not account for
variations in noise exposure from different industry groups or
different job task groups within the same occupation classifi-
cation. The assumption that jobs with the same title have
similar occupational noise exposure could also lead to misclas-
sification of exposure. Misclassification might also have occurred
when 801 O*NET occupation groups were combined into 40
NHANES occupation groups. Because the O*NET survey is
totally independent of the audiometry tests in NHANES,
however, such exposure misclassification is likely to be
non-differential and leads to a true association towards the null.
Although our study showed that as an exposure proxy,
longest job is better than current job in predicting occupational
noise-induced hearing loss, we could not account for the job
history nor the duration of each job. Because the reported
longest job is more likely to be related to hearing loss, however,
the bias would be non-differential. Collecting information on
full job history and duration would improve validity and
reliability of any noise exposure assessment using O*NET.
Although we examined three cycles of the NHANES data,
which offers significant power, causal inferences may not be
made because of the cross-sectional nature of the NHANES data.
Nevertheless, use of the longest job may be temporally relevant
to current audiometry test results.
One might argue that there is selection bias in that the
association between occupational noise and hearing loss is
different for subjects included in our analysis who provided
information on their longest job and those excluded due to no
longest job information. We found that the prevalence of noise
notch for included subjects was significantly different from the
prevalence for excluded subjects and that included subjects were
more likely than excluded subjects to have been exposed to loud
job noise for at least 3 months on all previous jobs (supple-
mental table 2). Most of the excluded subjects had never worked
(75%), are currently housewives (67%, all women), disabled
people with no job history (10%) and students (8%). Although
our results cannot be generalised to the non-included people
(housewives, students and the disabled), we believe that the
observed associations are valid to conclude noise exposure at
workplaces as an important risk factor for hearing loss and that
the selection bias is unlikely.

Exposure assessment
In summary, the present study supports the hypothesis that
occupational noise exposure increases the risk of hearing loss
across various occupations. Utilisation of the O*NET noise
exposure data would allow us to perform epidemiological
studies of occupational noise exposure in the general population
and to better understand the health effects of occupational noise
exposure.
