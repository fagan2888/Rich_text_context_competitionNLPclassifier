ABSTRACT
In multiple sclerosis, microglia/macrophage activation and
astrocyte reactivity are important components of the lesion
environment that can impact remyelination. The current
study characterizes these glial populations relative to
expression of candidate regulatory molecules in cuprizone
demyelinated corpus callosum. Importantly, periods of
recovery after acute or chronic cuprizone demyelination
are examined to compare conditions of efficient versus
limited remyelination, respectively. Microglial activation
attenuates after early demyelination. In contrast, astrocyte
reactivity persists throughout demyelination and a 6-week
recovery period following either acute or chronic demyeli-
nation. This astrocyte reaction is characterized by (a) early
proliferation, (b) increased expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein), Vim (vimentin), Fn1 (fibronectin) and CSPGs
(chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans) and (c) elaboration of a
dense network of processes. Glial processes elongated in the
axonal plane persist throughout lesion areas during both
the robust remyelination that follows acute demyelination
and the partial remyelination that follows chronic de-
myelination. However, prolonged astrocyte reactivity with
chronic cuprizone treatment does not progress to barrier
formation, i.e. dense compaction of astrocyte processes to
wall off the lesion area. Multiple candidate growth factors
and inflammatory signals in the lesion environment show
strong correlations with GFAP across the acute cuprizone
demyelination and recovery time course, yet there is more
divergence across the progression of chronic cuprizone
demyelination and recovery. However, differential glial scar
formation does not appear to be responsible for differential
remyelination during recovery in the cuprizone model. The
astrocyte phenotype and lesion characteristics in this
demyelination model inform studies to identify triggers of
non-remyelinating sclerosis in chronic multiple sclerosis
lesions.

INTRODUCTION
Glial cells are exquisitely sensitive to CNS (central nervous
system) damage. The complex reactions of astrocytes and mi-
croglia are key components of the pathological environment.
Astrocytes, more so than microglia, are associated with tissue
modifications that form barriers to regeneration, such as
axon growth and remyelination (Sofroniew and Vinters,
2010). In demyelinating diseases, the progression of astrocyte
reactivity and the associated regulatory signalling in the
lesion environment that inhibit remyelination are poorly
understood.
In the demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, astrocyte scar
formation is considered a prominent feature of the sclerotic
lesions observed in chronic cases. Furthermore, remyelinating
and non-remyelinating regions of multiple sclerosis lesions
exhibit differential astroglial phenotypes (John et al., 2002; Nair
et al., 2008). Inflammatory mediators in this autoimmune
disease can induce reactive changes in astrocytes (John et al.,

2005). Breakdown of the blood足brain barrier can also stimulate
astrocyte reactivity. Inflammation and blood足brain barrier
leakage are associated with active multiple sclerosis disease
stages. It is not clear how these processes may contribute to the
phenotype of astrocytes associated with non-remyelinating,
sclerotic lesions of chronic, inactive multiple sclerosis lesions. It
is also not known whether the duration of astrocyte reactivity
influences the astrocyte phenotype and progression of sclerosis
in chronic lesions.
The cuprizone neurotoxicant model of experimental
demyelination is advantageous for characterizing the glial
response during prolonged demyelination and differential
remyelination. Cuprizone ingestion causes oligodendrocyte
loss and microglial activation without a marked lymphocytic
response (Matsushima and Morell, 2001). These pathological
features are similar to pattern III lesions of multiple sclerosis
(Lucchinetti et al., 1999). Early microglial activation initiates
a cascade of signals that stimulates astrocytes to express
signalling molecules which contribute to demyelination,
indicating a key role of reactive astrocytes in the progression
of demyelinating disease (Kang et al., 2012). The ability to
remove the demyelinating agent simplifies studies of the
remyelination phase. When used as a short-term protocol,
cuprizone produces a single episode of `acute' demyelination
followed by efficient spontaneous remyelination. More
prolonged cuprizone ingestion results in a continuous
`chronic' demyelination state which subsequently remyeli-
nates poorly. Therefore cuprizone can facilitate comparison
of the tissue environments associated with efficient against
limited remyelination (Armstrong et al., 2006; Mason et al.,
2004).
Astrogliosis in the cuprizone model has typically been
characterized using immunohistochemical detection of GFAP
(glial fibrillary acidic protein) either to count the number of
astrocytes or measure immunoreactivity in a region of interest.
Astroglial activation begins during initial stages of cuprizone
demyelination (Buschmann et al., 2012; Hiremath et al., 1998)
and continues through at least 12 weeks of cuprizone
ingestion (Kipp et al., 2011; Lindner et al., 2009; Plant et al.,
2005; Xie et al., 2010). Following acute demyelination, GFAP
expression remains elevated for several weeks (Plant et al.,
2005). However, the astroglial response to injury is much more
complex than GFAP staining intensity or astrocyte cell number
can capture. More thorough characterization of the astroglial
reaction is required. Astroglial characteristics may be especially
important in the cuprizone model with respect to envir-
onmental features that influence differential remyelination
following acute versus chronic cuprizone. Therefore studies are
needed to phenotype the astrocytic response in the period
after removal of cuprizone from the diet.
The current studies characterize microglial activation and
astrogliosis throughout acute and chronic cuprizone demye-
lination with a focus on the subsequent recovery periods on
normal chow. We find that astrocyte reactivity, in contrast
with microglial activation, continues during chronic demye-
lination and through a 6-week recovery period to allow for
remyelination. A battery of immunohistochemical and his-
tological indicators is used to phenotype the astrocytic re-
sponse. QPCR (quantitative PCR) gene arrays further
characterize the pattern of genes expressed in the corpus
callosum throughout the periods of cuprizone treatment and
recovery. These arrays include analysis of indicators of
astrogliosis and candidate genes in the lesion environment
that may stimulate astroglial responses and/or regulate the
extent of remyelination. These QPCR arrays are the first to
examine expression patterns of environmental signals for
comparison between recovery periods with distinctly different
remyelination efficiencies, i.e. robust remyelination after an
acute episode of cuprizone demyelination as compared with
limited remyelination capacity after more prolonged cuprizone
treatment.
METHODS
Cuprizone model
The cuprizone model was performed as in our previous studies
of short- and long-term administration protocols (Armstrong
et al., 2006; Vana et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2012). Male C57BL/
6 mice (6足7 weeks of age) were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories and housed two per cage on a 12 h light足dark
cycle at the Uniformed Services Health Sciences animal
facility. Food and water were provided ad libitum. To induce
demyelination, 8-week-old mice were fed a 0.2% (w/w)
cuprizone diet [finely powdered oxalic bis(cyclohexylidene-
hydrazide); Sigma-Aldrich] mixed into milled chow (Certified
LM-485 code 7012CM; Harlan Teklad). Mice were fed
cuprizone continuously for either 6 weeks for `acute' or 12
weeks for `chronic' demyelination models. After cuprizone
feeding, mice were returned to normal chow for either 3- or
6-week periods to evaluate spontaneous recovery. Control
mice were fed normal chow without cuprizone and analysed
at ages matched to the start of cuprizone (8 weeks) and the
end points of each time course for 6 weeks of cuprizone and
6 weeks of recovery (20 weeks) or 12 weeks of cuprizone
and 6 weeks of recovery (26 weeks).
Analysis of tissue sections
Mice were perfused with 4% PFA (paraformaldehyde) and
brains were dissected prior to overnight post fixation in 4%
PFA. Brains were then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose overnight,
embedded in Tissue Tek OCT, and stored at 280属C. For immu-
nohistochemical analysis, 15 mm coronal sections were cut and
mounted on Superfrost Plus slides.
MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) was detected
with the monoclonal antibody 8足18C5 (Dr Minettia Gardinier,
Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City,
IA U.S.A.). GFAP was detected using a rabbit polyclonal IgG

antibody (DAKO). In combination with GFAP immunostaining,
Ki67 was detected following heating in Antigen Retrieval Citra
Solution (Biogenex). Vim (vimentin) was detected using a
mouse monoclonal antibody (Millipore). Fn1 (fibronectin) was
detected using a rabbit anti-Fn1 antibody (Chemicon,
Millipore). A mouse monoclonal anti-chondroitin sulphate
antibody (Clone CS-56, Sigma) was used to immunostain the
GAG (glycosaminoglycan) moiety of CSPGs (chondroitin
sulphate proteoglycans). DSD-1 is the mouse homologue of
rat Ptprz1 (phosphacan) and was detected with a monoclonal
against DSD-1 (Millipore). Anti-CD11b (Abcam) was used to
identify microglia/macrophage cells. Anti-CD36 (Abcam) was
used to identify endothelial cells of blood vessels. Primary
antibodies were detected with Alexa FluorH 555-conjugated
goat anti-rat IgG, Alexa FluorH 488-conjugated goat anti-
rabbit IgG (Invitrogen), Cy3 (indocarbocyanine)-conjugated
donkey anti-mouse IgG F(ab)2
(Jackson Immunoresearch), or
Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgM (Jackson
Immunoresearch). For collagen histology, paraffin sections
were stained using Masson's Trichrome Blue (Sigma) stain to
detect collagen fibres. Corpus callosum myelination status and
astrogliosis was estimated based on the area of MOG or GFAP
immunostaining, respectively, quantified in coronal sections
(Armstrong et al., 2006). An index of proliferation was
determined by counting all Ki67 immunolabelled nuclei in
the corpus callosum. MOG, GFAP and Ki67 were quantified in
the corpus callosum between the midline and the point
under the peak of the cingulum. At least three sections per
mouse and three mice per condition were included in the
quantification.
Custom array analysis of gene expression
RNA was isolated following a modified protocol from
SABiosciences (Zhou et al., 2012). At least three mice were
processed for each experimental condition and control group.
Briefly, the corpus callosum was microdissected on ice,
homogenized in 0.3 ml of TRIzolH (Invitrogen) and stored at
280属C. An additional 0.7 ml of TRIzolH was added to the
samples when the RNA was isolated according to the ma-
nufacturer's instructions. The RNA was purified using the RT2
QPCR-Grade RNA Isolation Kit (SABiosciences, PA-001). Purity
readings were determined with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer
(ThermoScientific). Samples were required to have A260/280
ratios above 2.0 and A260/230 ratios above 1.8. If necessary,
samples were re-purified according to the SABiosciences
protocol. Purified RNA samples were converted into cDNA
(600 ng per reaction) using the RT First Strand Kit
(SABiosciences, C-03) and used at 5 ng/10 ml in QPCR arrays.
A custom 386-well plate (SABiosciences) was designed for
QPCR expression analysis of 96 genes relevant to character-
ization of astrogliosis and the cuprizone lesion environment
(Supplementary Table S1 available at http://www.asnneuro.
org/an/004/an004e100add.htm). On each plate, four different
experimental conditions were run as a set of three disease
time points and one control time point without cuprizone
treatment. For each time point, cDNA was pooled from three
mice of the same condition. Each experimental and control
condition was run as technical triplicates on three different
plates. Raw Ct (cycle threshold) values of 0 (failed reaction)
and above 35 (below detection threshold) were excluded.
Values from four housekeeping genes (Tbp, Hprt1, Actb and
18 sRNA) were used for loading normalization and quality
screening for each sample. Relative changes across the
disease time course and control ages were determined using
the DDCt method relative to gene expression values for
control mice (no cuprizone; 8 weeks of age matched to 0
week of cuprizone treatment). GenePattern 2.0 was used for
analysis of relative mRNA expression patterns (Reich et al.,
2006).
Statistical analysis
Prism 5.0 (GraphPad, Inc.) was used for graphing and statistical
analyses. One-way ANOVA measures were used to determine
significant differences between cuprizone treatment groups
across the disease time course. Relative gene expression values
were individually compared with a theoretical value of 1.0, for
significance relative to no fold change, using a Student's t-test.
Probability values of P,0.05 were considered significant.
RESULTS
Immunohistochemical confirmation of major
disease stage of tissues used in analyses
Although cuprizone produces a relatively reproducible pattern
of demyelination and remyelination, variations between
anatomical sites and assessment methods lead to differences
in comparison between studies, especially relative to remye-
lination (Armstrong et al., 2006; Kipp et al., 2011; Lindner et al.,
2009; Mason et al., 2004; Xie et al., 2010). Therefore it is
important to first illustrate the relative changes in myelination
status across the time points to be used in the current study.
Coronal sections through the caudal corpus callosum were
immunostained for MOG, a myelin-specific glycoprotein, to
estimate myelination status throughout the course of
cuprizone treatment and recovery in the current study
(Figure 1). MOG immunoreactivity is present throughout the
extent of the corpus callosum in normal adult mice at 8 (start
of cuprizone treatment; results not shown) and 26 weeks of
age (end of time course; Figure 1A). The cuprizone treatment
protocol resulted in consistent and extensive corpus callosum
demyelination as shown at 6 and 12 weeks of cuprizone
ingestion (Figures 1B and 1C). Myelin recovery throughout the
corpus callosum indicated efficient spontaneous remyelination
within 6 weeks of return to normal chow after a 6-week
cuprizone treatment period (Figures 1D and 1F). In contrast, 12

weeks of cuprizone feeding followed by a return to normal
chow for 6 weeks resulted in partial, patchy remyelination
(Figures 1E and 1F).
Quantitative analysis of the MOG immunostaining shows
the reproducibility of these changes in myelination with each
cuprizone paradigm (Figure 1F) and informs interpretation of
the tissues used in the current studies for immunohistochem-
istry and QPCR. The myelination pattern shown here is
consistent with our previous studies of demyelination and
recovery with the same cuprizone protocol in C57BL/6 mice
using MOG immunostaining and electron microscopy
(Armstrong et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2010). The 6-week cuprizone
treatment will be referred to as `acute' demyelination,
denoting a single transient episode of demyelination. The 12-
week cuprizone treatment will be referred to as `chronic'
demyelination since these mice experience repeated demyeli-
nation and partial remyelination during prolonged cuprizone
exposure (Armstrong et al., 2006; Mason et al., 2004).

Immunohistochemistry to detect MOG in coronal sections through the corpus callosum of mice without cuprizone (A; 26 weeks

cuprizone from the diet (D, E). Myelination status was estimated as the immunostained area of the corpus callosum (F). Compared
with control mice at 8 (n58) or 26 (n53) weeks of age, myelination is significantly reduced after 6 (n55) or 12 weeks (n58) of
cuprizone. The myelinated area returns to normal levels during the 6-week recovery period following 6 weeks of cuprizone (n55) but
not following 12 weeks of cuprizone (n58). *P,0.05 compared with 26-week mice without cuprizone. Scale bar5100 mm for (A足E),

Relationship of astrocyte reactivity and microglia
activation during demyelination and recovery
time periods
We examined microglia and astrocyte populations as
potential regulators of the lesion environment during the
recovery period following cuprizone demyelination (Figure 2).
Astrocytes and microglia were detected by immunoreactivity
for GFAP and CD11b, respectively. In the corpus callosum of
normal adult mice, GFAP is present in fine processes of
distributed astrocytes and CD11b immunoreactivity is present
on small microglia with branched processes (Figure 2A). After
3 weeks of cuprizone feeding, CD11b immunolabelled cells
are present at a very high density in the corpus callosum
(Figure 2B). At this early time point, astrocyte reactivity was
also evident based on increased GFAP expression, hyper-
trophy, and disorganized process distribution (Figure 2B).
CD11b immunoreactivity is attenuated at 6 weeks and further
reduced at 12 weeks in contrast with the persistent astrocyte
reactivity detected by GFAP immunohistochemistry
(Figures 2C and 2E). Astrocyte reactivity continues to be
evident at 6 weeks after the removal of cuprizone from the
diet (Figures 2D and 2F), indicating that astrocyte reactivity
may influence remyelination following acute and chronic
demyelination.
Astrogliosis is induced for prolonged periods with
cuprizone treatment
GFAP immunoreactivity was further examined for changes in
astrocyte morphology and distribution (Figure 3) that
indicate progressive stages of astrogliosis (Nash et al., 2011;
Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). In non-treated adult mice,
astrocytes are distributed in discrete territories throughout
the corpus callosum (Figure 3A). High GFAP expression in
dense processes is prominent during cuprizone feeding
Figure 2 Relationship of astrocyte reactivity and microglia activation during demyelination and recovery time periods
GFAP (green) and CD11b (red) immunohistochemistry shows astrocyte reactivity and microglia/macrophage activation, respectively,
after 3 weeks of cuprizone (B) in comparison with mice fed normal chow without cuprizone (A). CD11b immunoreactive cells are
attenuated by 6 weeks of cuprizone (C) and then further reduced at the later time points either with continuous cuprizone (E; 12
weeks cuprizone) or during the recovery period following cuprizone for the acute (D; 6 weeks cuprizone followed by 6 weeks on
normal chow) or chronic conditions (F; 12 weeks cuprizone followed by 6 weeks on normal chow). In contrast, strong astrocyte
reactivity continues with continued cuprizone treatment as well as during the recovery periods. Scale bar shown for (A足F) shown in

Figure 3 Reactive astrogliosis and proliferation throughout chronic cuprizone treatment and recovery
GFAP (green) immunohistochemistry shows increased immunoreactivity and altered astrocytic morphology after 6 (B) or 12 (C) weeks
of cuprizone treatment in comparison with mice fed normal chow without cuprizone (A). These characteristics of reactive astrocytes
continue to be prominent after a 6-week recovery period on normal chow following cuprizone treatment for 6 (D) or 12 weeks (E).
Nuclear immunoreactivity for Ki67 (red; arrows) detects proliferating cells, some of which are clearly expressing GFAP (C, D inset
arrows). Estimation of the percent area of the corpus callosum immunostained for GFAP shows increased reactive astrogliosis that is
maintained throughout cuprizone treatment and during recovery on normal chow (F). Quantification of Ki67 positive cells shows
significantly increased labelling at 3 weeks of cuprizone but proliferation is relatively mild across the later cuprizone time points (G).
Quantification of cells double immunolabelled for GFAP and Ki67 shows a significant increase early during acute demyelination at 3
weeks of cuprizone treatment (H). *P,0.05 compared with control mice (8 weeks of age) without cuprizone (n53足4 mice per time
point). Scale bar shown for (A足E) shown in (C)5100 mm and inset550 mm.

(Figures 3B and 3C). Extensive GFAP immunoreactivity in
elongated processes persists during the recovery period on
normal chow after either 6 or 12 weeks of cuprizone (Figures 3D,
3E and 3F).
GFAP immunolabelling was combined with detection of
Ki67, a marker of cycling cells, to evaluate astrocyte prolife-
ration as an additional factor indicating reactive astrogliosis
(Nash et al., 2011; Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010). Overall cell
proliferation is significantly increased only at the 3-week
time point but is evident at each of the disease stages
analysed in cuprizone-treated mice (Figure 3). Ki67 labelling
is observed in cells that often appear as doublets consistent
with cycling cells (Figures 3A and 3G). GFAP+ Ki67+ cells
comprise a minority of the cycling cells, ranging from 29足
40% across cuprizone time points (Figure 3H). Notably,
astrocyte proliferation is significantly increased at 3 weeks
of cuprizone, which is early during the acute demyelination
period (Figure 3H).
Vim expression was also examined as an indicator of
reactive astrocytes (Fuller et al., 2007; Nash et al., 2011). In
the normal adult CNS, Vim is localized along blood vessels but
is not expressed by astrocytes (Figure 4). Vim expression is co-
localized with GFAP in reactive astrocytes throughout the
cuprizone treatment period and continues during recovery on
Figure 4 Vim expression in astrocytes after chronic cuprizone
(A) Strong Vim immunoreactivity is evident in the corpus callosum (CC) after 3 weeks of cuprizone. Double immunostaining with
CD36, a marker of endothelial cells of blood vessels, accounts for only a subset of Vim expression. (B) Vim (red) and GFAP (green)
double immunostaining shows extensive co-localization (yellow) in the corpus callosum at 6 weeks of cuprizone treatment.
Astrocytes of the cerebral cortex have a lower level of Vim expression as compared with the adjacent corpus callosum. (C足H) Co-
localization of Vim expression with GFAP continues through the recovery phase following chronic cuprizone demyelination. Regions
of the corpus callosum in coronal tissue sections of mice without cuprizone treatment (C, E, G; 26 weeks of age) or after 12 weeks of
cuprizone followed by 6 weeks on normal chow (D, F, H). Normal white matter astrocytes detected with immunolabelling for GFAP (C
and green in G) do not express Vim (E and red in G), which is found in blood vessels and may co-localize with astrocyte processes
that extend to blood vessels (arrows in C, E, G). In contrast, Vim (D and red in H) is co-localized with GFAP (F and green in H) in the
cell body and processes (arrows in D, F, H) of elongated astrocytes during acute and chronic cuprizone treatment (not shown) that
continues through the 6-week recovery period on normal chow (D, F, H). Scale bar for (A, B)5100 mm; (C, E, G) shown in

normal chow (Figure 4). Vim up-regulation is most evident in
the corpus callosum and much less pronounced in astrocytes
of the adjacent cerebral cortex. GFAP and Vim intermediate
filament proteins illustrate marked co-localization in astro-
glial processes elongated parallel to axons.
Expression of extracellular matrix molecules in
cuprizone lesions indicates severe, diffuse
astrogliosis without fibrotic scar formation
Astrogliosis can lead to deposition of extracellular matrix mo-
lecules to form a glial scar, which has been correlated with
chronic forms of multiple sclerosis and implicated as a barrier to
oligodendrocyte progenitor recruitment and/or differentiation
after demyelination (Haist et al., 2012; Siebert and Osterhout,
2011; Siskova et al., 2006). CS-56 antibody was used to detect
the GAG moiety of CSPGs. CS-56 immunoreac-
tivity is low in the normal adult corpus callosum (Figure 5A)
but is increased after cuprizone treatment (Figure 5). Fn1
immunoreactivity also accumulated in the corpus callosum
during cuprizone treatment (Figure 6). However, collagen fibrils
are not observed in chronic cuprizone lesions (Figure 7), which is
consistent with a lack of blood足brain barrier disruption or overt
tissue destruction (Sofroniew and Vinters, 2010).
QPCR array analysis throughout acute and
chronic cuprizone treatment and recovery
QPCR was performed using a custom array to quantify
gene expression patterns in the corpus callosum throughout
the course of cuprizone treatment and recovery periods.
Candidate genes were selected for two main purposes: (1)
characterization of astrogliosis, in support of our immunohis-
tochemical analysis, and (2) analysis of candidate signalling
molecules in the lesion environment that may mediate astro-
glial reactivity or may impact remyelination. Supplementary
Table S1 shows the full list of genes analysed along with gene
names, abbreviations and sequence reference numbers. RNA
isolated from the corpus callosum was analysed at 3-week
intervals throughout the progression of cuprizone treatment
for either 6 or 12 weeks. Importantly, the studies examined
recovery periods after chronic cuprizone treatment to
compare the expression pattern associated with limited
remyelination with that of the more effective remyelination
during recovery following acute cuprizone demyelination.
Heat maps were generated to identify gene expression
patterns that clustered with GFAP as a marker of astrogliosis
(Figure 8).
The heat map for genes analysed throughout the acute
(Figure 8A) and chronic (Figure 8B) cuprizone treatment and
recovery time course show broad pattern similarity.
Hierarchical clustering driven by GFAP identifies a set of
genes with a similar pattern (above arrow in Figure 8).
Overall, the genes clustering most closely with GFAP show
relatively low expression (dark blue) in normal adult and
undergo strong up-regulation during early demyelination
(dark red at 3 weeks) with elevated levels continuing through
6 weeks and 12 weeks of cuprizone. Normalization during the
recovery period appears less efficient following 6 weeks
against 12 weeks of cuprizone. This heat map shows the
correlation of GFAP with Vim and Fn1, supporting the immuno-
staining patterns shown above. Among the CSPGs examined,

specifically detect DSD-1 confirmed that this specific CSPG
isoform is expressed in lesions (Figure 9) in a pattern similar to
the pan-CSPG antibody CS-56 (Figure 5).
Table 1 shows the specific fold-change values for these
genes and other established indicators of reactive astrogliosis
(Nash et al., 2011; Sofroniew, 2009; Zamanian et al., 2012).
This QPCR array approach can reliably detect differences of
greater than 1.33 fold (Hoebeeck et al., 2007). Significant but
relatively mild up-regulation is observed for Sox9, a
transcription factor associated with astrocyte synthesis of
genes involved with the production of chondroitin sulphate
side chains (Gris et al., 2007). Nes (nestin) is an intermediate
filament protein that is up-regulated in astrocytes following
some forms of CNS damage. With cuprizone treatment, Nes is
only significantly increased at the 3-week time point, which
is consistent with a previous immunohistochemical study of
Nes expression (Gudi et al., 2011). TnC (tenascin C) is also
often up-regulated in reactive astrocytes but is not strongly
activated with cuprizone treatment. S100b and Glu1
(glutamine synthetase) are also associated with astrocytes
but do not show an expression pattern that clusters with
GFAP across either cuprizone time course. Genes associated
with oligodendrocytes, Plp1 (proteolipid protein) and Gm98,
serve to differentiate from the GFAP cluster and monitor
oligodendrocyte loss and recovery (Figures 8A and 8B).
Interestingly, CSPG4 (Figures 8A and 8B) also known as
NG2, clusters more toward GFAP in the acute time course and
more closely with Plp1 in the chronic time course.
Supplementary Table S2 (available at http://www.asnneuro.
org/an/004/an004e100add.htm) shows the fold-change
values and statistical analysis for genes that did not cluster
with GFAP, i.e. genes below the arrows in Figures 8(A) and
8(B).
In addition to characterization of astrocyte reactivity, our
custom array examined candidate factors that can regulate
astroglial reactivity as well as factors that can regulate oli-
godendrocyte lineage responses and remyelination. Analysis of
this set of inflammatory and growth factor components
facilitates an understanding of the lesion environment relative
to astroglial reactivity across each disease time course. Table 2
shows the fold-change values of growth factor and inflammat-
ory signalling components that clustered with GFAP across the
acute and chronic demyelination and recovery time courses.
Interestingly, the set of 22 candidate genes that correlate most
closely with GFAP is the same in both the acute and chronic time
courses. Among the genes clustering with GFAP (Figure 8), the
fold change values and extent of correlation are highest during
the acute demyelination and recovery time course (Figure 10).
During the chronic time course, several growth factors,
including FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2) and IGF-1 (insulin-
like growth factor 1) maintain high GFAP correlations at or
above the acute levels. However, TGFb (transforming growth
factor b) signalling components, BMP4 (bone morphogenetic
protein 4) and LIF (leukaemia inhibitory factor) do not correlate
as well with GFAP during the chronic time course.
Microglia are important contributors to the expression of
inflammatory signals and growth factors in the cuprizone
lesion environment. The microglial marker Itgam (integrin

and present at lower levels by 12 weeks of cuprizone (D). The CC exhibits relatively minimal Fn1 immunoreactivity after a 6-week

alpha M or CDllb) is increased during the initial episode of
demyelination and also clusters with GFAP. However, Itgam
and several genes clustering nearby (i.e. Itgam through BMP4)
exhibit normalization during chronic cuprizone (blue shades at
12 weeks in Figure 8B) that is not observed for GFAP (red
shades at 12 weeks in Figure 8B). These findings are consistent
with the early-stage activation of microglia yet prolonged
astrocyte reactivity that was observed in our immunohisto-
chemical analysis of CD11b and GFAP expression (Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
The current study characterizes the expression of candidate
regulatory molecules in cuprizone demyelinated corpus
callosum to compare conditions of efficient with limited
remyelination. Our analysis demonstrates that astrocyte
reactivity persists during remyelination, in contrast with
transient microglial activation, and therefore may be an
important component of the lesion environment during the
recovery period to influence remyelination efficiency.
Cuprizone mediated demyelination in the corpus callosum
results in severe, diffuse astrogliosis. Astrocytes exhibit
increased expression of GFAP, Vim, Fn1 and CSPGs with a
dense elaboration of processes and proliferation occurring
during an early disease stage. Astrogliosis continues through-
out the period of active demyelination. Prolonged astrocyte
reactivity does not lead to progressive severity of astrogliosis or
transition to a compact barrier or fibrotic scar. However, after
removal of the demyelinating agent astrocyte reactivity does
not normalize rapidly. Up-regulation of GFAP and Vim persists
following either acute cuprizone demyelination in conjunction
with extensive spontaneous remyelination or chronic demye-
lination with poor remyelination. Surprisingly, array expression
analysis of candidate genes most closely correlated with GFAP
in the corpus callosum tissues showed that the top 22 genes
are shared between the acute and chronic time courses. The set
of inflammatory mediators and growth factors that clusters
with GFAP is most strongly up-regulated during acute
demyelination.
Characterization of astrogliosis in the cuprizone demyelina-
tion model provides an important comparison with astrocyte
reactivity stimulated by distinct mechanisms of CNS damage,
such as penetrating injuries, ischaemia or inflammation.
Astrocyte reactivity is heterogeneous with differential pheno-
types dependent upon the inducing stimulus (Zamanian et al.,
2012). Comparison of an ischaemic stimulus [MCAO (middle
cerebral artery occlusion)] with an inflammatory stimulus [LPS
(lipopolysaccharide) injection] showed differential expression
among four established markers of reactivity in cortical
astrocytes. MCAO induced elevation of GFAP, Vim, Nes and
TnC while LPS elevated GFAP and Vim expression without up-
regulation of Nes or TnC (Zamanian et al., 2012). In contrast
with MCAO or LPS, the cuprizone model involves white matter
astrocytes with demyelination as the predominant stimulus
and occurs over a time course of several months. Astrocytes in
the cortex exhibited cuprizone effects of hypertrophy and
increased GFAP but these effects were less pronounced than in
the corpus callosum (Figures 2足4), which is consistent with
GFAP data from others (Buschmann et al., 2012; Gudi et al.,
2011). Relatively mild changes were observed in the corpus
callosum across the cuprizone time course for Nes and TnC as
well as S100b and Glu1. The dramatic and prolonged elevation
of GFAP and Vim in demyelinated white matter, as well as in
cortex with diverse injury models (i.e. MCAO and LPS), shows
that up-regulation of these intermediate filament proteins is a
consistent marker of reactive astrocyte phenotypes.
Astrogliosis in multiple sclerosis lesions varies with
autoimmune activity, blood足brain barrier integrity, location
within the lesion area and disease duration (Lassmann, 2005;
Wu and Raine, 1992). Astrocytes express GFAP and Vim in

lesions across multiple sclerosis stages while scar forming
astrocytes of chronic lesions exhibited antigenic changes that
included increased expression of Nes and both TnC and TnR
(Holley et al., 2003). However, another study showed
demyelinated inactive multiple sclerosis lesions had increased
levels of TnC but not TnR while neither tenascin was
increased in demyelinated active lesions (Mohan et al.,
2010). An increase of astrocytes expressing GFAP can be
associated with actively demyelinating through early remye-
linating multiple sclerosis lesions (Schonrock et al., 1998).
Astrocytes undergoing proliferation, identified by Ki67, were
relatively rare or absent in multiple sclerosis lesions but most
frequently observed in early active and early remyelinating
lesions (Holley et al., 2003; Schonrock et al., 1998), which is
consistent with findings in the cuprizone model (Gudi et al.,
2009) and current study (Figure 3). Accumulation of fibrillar
collagen is associated with perivascular inflammation in
multiple sclerosis lesions (Black et al., 2010; Mohan et al.,
2010). The cuprizone lesions did not exhibit an astroglial scar
interface with areas of fibrillar collagen. This result is
consistent with the cuprizone mechanism of demyelination
and indicates an absence of astroglial barrier formation that

RNA was isolated from the corpus callosum of mice at each time point shown along the top of the heat map. The time points are
indicated as the number of weeks of cuprizone ingestion (0, 3, 6, 9 or 12) followed by the weeks on normal chow for recovery (+3 or
+6). Results show fold-change values for each gene from triplicate PCR reactions which were each run on a separate plate. For each
gene, relative expression levels are shown with the highest as dark red and the lowest as dark blue. Genes are hierarchically clustered
based on correlation with expression of GFAP across each time course. Genes above the arrow on each heat map show a pattern
similar to GFAP. The age-matched equivalent to the beginning of cuprizone treatment is shown as 0 week while the equivalent to the
end of the time course of treatment and recovery is 20 week (A) for the acute and 26 week (B) for the chronic time course.

would typically be associated with fibromeningeal cell
infiltration during tissue destruction from trauma (Heck
et al., 2007) or perivascular infiltration of immune cells in
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Voskuhl et al.,
2009). Chronic cuprizone lesions did show a dense network of
thin astrocyte processes expressing GFAP and Vim similar to
the astroglial morphology observed in chronic multiple
sclerosis lesions (Black et al., 2010).
A major effect of astrocytes in a lesion environment is
through expression of extracellular matrix molecules. Fn1 is
normally present at low levels in the adult white matter but
was increased in the corpus callosum during acute cuprizone
demyelination. Deposition of Fn1 has been reported in active
but not inactive multiple sclerosis lesions (Sobel and Mitchell,
1989; van Horssen et al., 2007). Fn1 in multiple sclerosis
lesions was associated with extravasation from blood vessels
or localized to astrocytes. Expression of Fn1 in white matter
may inhibit oligodendrocyte process outgrowth and myelin
sheath formation (Siskova et al., 2009).
CSPGs in glial scars inhibit axon regeneration (Bartus et al.,
2012). Our array analysis indicated that Ptprz1 expression
clustered with GFAP, in contrast with the other CSPGs
examined (neurocan, Ncan; brevican, Bcan; aggrecan, Acan;
NG2, CSPG4) or the xylotransferase enzyme isoforms (Xylt1,
Xylt2) that initiate glycosylation of CSPGs. While NG2 is
expressed by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, astrocytes
express each of the other CSPGs. Increased expression of
CSPGs in reactive astrocytes may be mediated by BMP4 or
TGFb (Fuller et al., 2007; Susarla et al., 2011). Distinct CSPGs
may have differential effects on oligodendrocyte lineage cell
responses. Immunolabelling confirmed expression of phos-
phacan/DSD-1 in cuprizone lesions (Figure 9). Ptprz1 can be
expressed by astrocytes, neurons and oligodendrocytes in the
CNS (Faissner et al., 2006). Given that DSD-1 is a secreted
protein, additional studies would be required to determine
the cellular source(s) of DSD-1 during cuprizone demyelina-
tion and recovery. Both the pan-CSPG antibody CS-56
(Figure 5) and the DSD-1 antibody (Figure 9) consistently
exhibited normalization of immunoreactivity following acute
demyelination that was less evident following chronic demy-
elination. In vitro studies have indicated that neurocan and
Ptprz1 inhibit oligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation
(Siebert and Osterhout, 2011). However, Ptprz1 bound to
contactin-1 on the surface of oligodendrocyte precursor cells
inhibits proliferation and promotes differentiation into
mature oligodendrocytes based on analysis of glial popula-
tions in Ptprz deficient mice (Lamprianou et al., 2011).
Furthermore, Ptprz2/2 mice exhibit impaired recovery from
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that is assoc-
iated with increased apoptosis of oligodendrocytes (Harroch
et al., 2002). In a lysolecithin mediated demyelination,
Ptprz2/2 mice exhibited accelerated axon loss (Huang
et al., 2012). Therefore primary and secondary effects of
Ptprz isoforms could be involved in neuron-glial interactions
in lesions. In multiple sclerosis biopsies, Ptprz1 is expressed in
lesion areas with cells expressing PLP, which together with
the mouse studies indicates a potential role of Ptprz1 in
oligodendrocyte survival and remyelination in demyelinating
diseases (Harroch et al., 2002).
The current data from our QPCR analysis provides an
important comparison of expression patterns during the
recovery phase following acute against chronic demyelina-
tion. Our previous cuprizone QPCR study, using independent
sets of mice, provided similar results for GFAP and Vim along

tion in the greyscale images on the right. DSD-1 immunoreactivity is

6-week recovery period on normal chow, DSD-1 immunoreactivity was more
prominent after 12 weeks of cuprizone (I, J) than after only 6 weeks of
cuprizone (E, F). Scale bar for (A, C, E, G, I) shown in (A)5200 mm. Scale bar

with multiple myelin genes as indicators of demyelination and
remyelination (Zhou et al., 2012). However, acute and chronic
recovery periods were not examined for comparison. Another
group performed an Affymetix GeneChip array study of corpus
callosum tissues following acute and chronic cuprizone but
limited the recovery interval to only 2 days after return to
normal diet (Kipp et al., 2011). The majority of hybridization
array studies using the cuprizone model have focused on
demyelination progression and the role of inflammatory
components (Arnett et al., 2003; Jurevics et al., 2002; Morell
et al., 1998). A QPCR study of a set of 13 candidate growth
factors during acute demyelination showed results similar to
the current study with significantly increased expression of
TGFb1, IGF-1, LIF and FGF2 (Gudi et al., 2011). Up-regulation
of IGF-1 and FGF2 in microglia isolated during acute cuprizone
demyelination complements in situ analysis, indicating
expression of these growth factors in both microglia and
astrocytes in demyelinating lesions (Armstrong et al., 2002,
2006; Gudi et al., 2011; Komoly et al., 1992; Messersmith et al.,
2000). Thus, both astrocytes and microglia may contribute to
the significant increase of expression of IGF-1 and FGF2 during
demyelination. The presence of a specific growth factor and
inflammatory signals in the lesion environment indicates
potential activity, but extensive in vivo analyses are required to
delineate functional effects on remyelination (Moore et al.,
2011). Studies in the cuprizone model using transgenic or
knockout mice indicate a role for IGF-1 in supporting oligo-
dendrocyte survival and FGF2 as an inhibitor of oligoden-
drocyte progenitor differentiation (Armstrong et al., 2006;
Mason et al., 2000; Murtie et al., 2005).
After 3 weeks of cuprizone, IL-1b (interleukin 1b) and TNFa
(tumour necrosis factor a) are among the most highly up-
regulated genes in our analysis (Table 2: Il1b, TNF). IL-1b and
TNFa can be secreted by astrocytes or microglia and are
involved in microglial activation (Nair et al., 2008). Microglial
activation is strong during the initial phase of demyelination
and much less robust during the chronic phase, as shown in
Figure 2 and at additional time points in our previous study
(Xie et al., 2010). Importantly, early microglial activation and
release of inflammatory signals, such as IL-1b, can activate
CD3 T-cells and initiate a cascade resulting in astrocyte
secretion of TNFa, chemokines and ROS (reactive oxygen
species) that induce demyelination at 3足4 weeks after
initiation of cuprizone (Kang et al., 2012).
Together, these studies demonstrate several key findings
that are important in the interpretation of environmental
effects on remyelination capacity. Astroglial reactivity
persists throughout the period of cuprizone feeding, in
contrast with microglial activation which is more transient.
The astroglial response is relatively similar during the recovery
phase following acute or chronic demyelination even though
the extent of remyelination is significantly different. Signals
that may inhibit the efficiency of remyelination following
chronic demyelination do not appear to be significantly
increased after chronic demyelination. Therefore inhibitory
molecules may simply have a greater effect when the pool of
oligodendrocyte progenitors is reduced compared with the
amplified progenitor pool that is available after acute
demyelination (Armstrong et al., 2002, 2006; Mason et al.,
2004).

Figure 10 Comparison of acute and chronic time courses based on the Pearson correlation with GFAP
Genes that clustered with GFAP are ordered as in the heat map for the acute time course (Figure 7A). Correlations above 0.65 are
considered significant (grey line) (Krasnov et al., 2005). Genes associated with characterization of astrocyte reactivity have a similar
correlation across the acute and chronic time courses, as shown for Vim, Nes, TnC, Ptprz1 and Fn1. A similar tight correlation with
GFAP for both time courses is found for FGF2 and IGF-1. However, many of the signalling components in the lesion environment
show lower correlations with GFAP during the chronic time course, as shown for the TGFb1, TGFbR1 and TGFbR2, BMP4 and LIF.

The cuprizone model has been extremely useful for
identifying the specific molecular signals that regulate oligo-
dendrocyte survival and the efficiency of oligodendrogenesis
and remyelination (Deverman and Patterson, 2012; Gudi et al.,
2011; Moore et al., 2011; VonDran et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,
2012). The current studies now show the cuprizone model to be
a relatively simple, reproducible model of persistent astrogliosis
that continues during recovery following both acute and chro-
nic demyelination. Prolonged astroglial reactivity from chronic
cuprizone toxicity is not sufficient to lead to increased
astrogliosis severity associated with barrier formation, fibrosis
or sclerosis. These findings indicate that cuprizone demyelina-
tion may be an ideal system to test cellular and molecular
factors that induce the endogenous astrocyte reactivity to
progress to more severe astrogliosis and form non-remyelinating
sclerotic areas of multiple sclerosis lesions.
