Factors Influencing the Total Inpatient
Pharmacy Cost at a Tertiary Hospital in
Malaysia: A Retrospective Study
Syed Mohamed Aljunid1,2 and Saad Ahmed Ali Jadoo1
Abstract
The steady growth of pharmaceutical expenditures is a major concern for health policy makers and health care managers in
Malaysia. Our study examined the factors affecting the total inpatient pharmacy cost (TINPC) at the Universiti Kebangsaan
Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). In this retrospective study, we used 2011 administration electronic prescriptions records
and casemix databases at UKMMC to examine the impact of sociodemographic, diagnostic, and drug variables on the TINPC.
Bivariate and multivariate analyses of the factors associated with TINPC were conducted. The mean inpatient pharmacy cost
per patient was USD 102.07 (SD = 24.76). In the multivariate analysis, length of stay (LOS; B = 0.349, P < .0005) and severity
level III (B = 0.253, P < .0005) were the primary factors affecting the TINPC. For each day increase in the LOS and each
increase of a case of severity level III, there was an increase of approximately USD 11.97 and USD 171.53 in the TINPC per
year, respectively. Moreover, the number of prescribed items of drugs and supplies was positively associated with the TINPC
(B = 0.081, P < .0005). Gender appears to have affected the TINPC; male patients seem to be associated with a higher TINPC
than females (mean = 139.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 112.97-166.13, P < .001). Surgical procedures were associated
with higher cost than medical cases (mean = 87.93, 95% CI: 61.00-114.85, P < .001). Malay (MYR 242.02, SD = 65.37) and
Chinese (MYR 214.66, SD = 27.99) ethnicities contributed to a lower TINPC compared with Indian (MYR 613.93, SD =
98.41) and other ethnicities (MYR 578.47, SD = 144.51). A longer hospitalization period accompanied by major complications
and comorbidities had the greatest influence on the TINPC.

Introduction
The steady growth of pharmaceutical expenditures is a major
concern for health policy makers in Malaysia, where medi-
cine expenditures have grown to represent approximately
11.4 % of the operating budget of the Ministry of Health
Malaysia in 2012.1 The lack of a of national pricing policy
has led to escalating medicine prices, significant variation
between private and public sectors, and limited accessibility
to affordable medicines.1 Consequently, the Malaysian
National Medicine Policy (MNMP) was developed with an
agenda that primarily focuses on how to manage medicine
and how to reduce unnecessary resource consumption.
Methods such as cost containment, cost-effectiveness assess-
ment, generic drug promotion, and international price refer-
encing are being considered.1 The need for cost and
pharmacoeconomics evaluations is well acknowledged.2-6 In
terms of health-policy comparatives and analytic techniques,
health economic studies provide important and valuable
information that enables health care decision makers to
adjust and effectively use of pharmaceuticals.3 In this article,
we used normal linear specifications to test a number of
factors (eg, sociodemographic, diagnostic, and drug data)
that are thought to impact the total inpatient pharmacy cost
(TINPC), and we compared our results with others from lit-
erature. To establish these linear relationships, we needed 2
essential sources of individual patient-level data (IPD): phar-
maceutical cost data and patient characteristics (ie, diagno-
sis, procedures, and e-prescriptions data).
IPD captures the details of specific patient (depending on
the data source) and serves as a potential tool to analyze
pharmaceutical cost.4 However, many countries including
Malaysia are hindered by the lack of the availability of
detailed illness costs at IPD, which can reflect negatively on

the health economic analysis relevant to the local health care
system. The National University of Malaysia Medical Center
(UKMMC) was a pioneer that adopted and developed its
own casemix and Malaysian Diagnosis-Related Groups
(MY-DRGs) system in 2002.7
DRGs are patient classification systems (PCSs), which
are technically and clinically practical systems that facilitate
the estimation of patient costs. They classify each patient
case according to the diagnosis and other case characteris-
tics, such as the patient's age, gender, case severity, comor-
bidities, and procedures performed.8 PCSs have long been
recognized as being of great importance in supporting deci-
sion makers with resource utilization and helping with bud-
get planning as well.9 MY-DRGs have been linked to and
supported by an effective pharmacy electronic prescribing
(e-prescribing) system, which provides information about
the medicine prescribed as well as the quantity, dose, and
pathology at the individual level.10
Considerable research has been performed worldwide to
correlate the cost-affecting factors with total hospital costs. A
combination of the drug and diagnostic data, rather than either
type of data alone, can better estimate total health care
costs.4,9,11 Most research, however, has had to use surrogate
data for the cost of individual patient care; some studies have
used length of hospital stay,12-14 severity of illness,15,16
increase in the number of prescribed items,3 and demographic
structure17; and some have modeled drug expenditures based
on morbidity data.18
This article describes some factors that are likely to influ-
ence the TINPC. Our intent is to provide information to aid
health policy makers, health-system pharmacists, and other
health care managers to determine how future sociodemo-
graphic, diagnostic, and drug data will jointly affect phar-
macy expenditures in their own organizations.
Methods
Study Design and Sampling Technique
This study is a secondary analysis of a retrospective study
conducted at the University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical
Center (UKMMC) in 2015.4,19 Briefly, information on all
patients admitted in UKMMC from January 1 to December
31, 2011, was collected from the pharmacy e-prescribing and
Casemix databases. Outpatient visits and patients who were
admitted before or after 2011 were excluded. To produce one
set of data, shared variables such as patient medical registra-
tion number (MRN), date of admission, and the principle
diagnosis were used to join the 2 sets electronically.
Study Outcomes and Definitions
The primary outcome of this study was the TINPC per
patient. Figure 1 illustrates the costing approaches used to
calculate the TINPC, and the complete estimation methods
are described in detail elsewhere.4
A number of proposed factors that may have impacted the
TINPC are shown in Figure 2. Patient sociodemographics
(age, gender, and ethnicity) and diagnostic data (the LOS,
type of the cases) were extracted from casemix database, and
the drug data (the number of medications and supplies items
prescribed in each episode of care) were extracted from the
e-prescribing database.
Patient age was defined as age at the last birthday on the
day the patient was admitted to UKMMC. Gender was
assigned base on sex, male (1) and female (2). The ethnici-
ties of the target population were Malay (1), Chinese (2),
Indian (3), and other nationalities (a small minority of
Malaysians who do not fit into the broader 3 ethnic groups)
(4). Hospital LOS was defined as the duration the patient
stayed in the ward from admission until discharge. In the
MY-DRG system, the minimum LOS for any patient is 1
day (at least), including patients who were admitted and dis-
charged on the same day. Therefore, the LOS was calculated
for each patient / episode using the following equation: (date
of discharge ­ date of admission) + one. The number of
drugs and supply items is defined as the number of drugs
and supplies prescribed in each e-prescription for each inpa-
tient episode. Patient cases are categorized into 2 case
groups: medical and surgical cases. Medical cases are
patients who were admitted to a medical-based discipline
ward without any major procedures. Surgical cases are
patients who were admitted to surgical-based discipline
wards and (usually) underwent major surgical procedures.
MY-DRG is a casemix system used in Malaysia: it was
developed based on an international grouper called United
Nations University-Case Based Groups (UNU-CBG) grou-
per. There are 3 severity levels for acute conditions in
MY-DRG: severity level I (no complications or comorbidi-
ties), severity level II (minor complications or comorbidi-
ties), and severity level III (major complications or
comorbidities). The severity levels are determined by the
grouper based on the secondary diagnoses and procedures.
The severity level is assigned by the grouper software fol-
lowing the algorithm.
Statistical Analysis
Clinical and demographic characteristics were reported for
each patient based on the episode of care (admission and
discharge). Some missing data were found during the data
analysis process; however, the extent to which the data
were missing was limited and did not affect the structure of
study. The collected data were analyzed using Statistical
Package for Social Science (SPSS) program version 16.0
(SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois).20 A normality test
(Kolmogorov-Smirnov) was performed and all quantitative
data were found to be normally distributed. Descriptive
analyses were used to summarize the primary outcome of
this study (TINPC per patient) and the affecting factors.
Furthermore, bivariate analyses (eg, Pearson's correlation
analysis, independent-sample t tests, and analysis of
Aljunid and Ali Jadoo 3
variance [ANOVA]) were performed to test the association
between the factors and the study outcome. Significant fac-
tors affecting the TINPC in the bivariate analysis (P value
< .05) were included in the multivariate analysis.
Multivariate linear regression analysis (backward
technique) was performed to identify the significant factors
affecting TINPC. In "backward elimination," all indepen-
dent variables are entered into the equation first and the
variables that are not significant are removed one by one
until a satisfactory model is obtained.

Results
Descriptive Analyses
The average patient ages was 43.53 years (SD = 22.28 years)
(range:0-107),and7906(57.8%)werefemales.
Approximately half of the patients were Malay (6738,
49.3%), diagnosed as medical cases (8469, 61.9%), with
severity level I (53.6%). The LOS ranged from 1 to 69 days
with an average LOS of 6.76 (SD = 7.16) days and a median
of 4 days. In total, more 111 794 items (ie, the number of
drugs and supplies) were prescribed for all 13 673 patients
with an average of 8.18 (SD = 5.81; range, 1 to 25 items;
median, 6 items). The TINPC calculated for all 13 673
patients was Malaysia Ringgit (MYR) 4 326 458.36, which
is equivalent to USD 1 395 631.73 (based on the exchange
rate from August 27, 2014). The mean cost for each patient
was MYR 316.42 (SD = MYR 76.75), which is equivalent to
USD102.07 (SD = USD24.76), and a median cost of MYR
109.65, which is equivalent to USD 35.37 (Table 1).
Bivariate Analysis
A Pearson product moment correlation was performed to
determine the relationship between the patient age, LOS,
number of items of drugs and supplies, and TINPC. As
shown in Table 1, there was a positive correlation between
the patient age, LOS, number of items of drugs and supplies,
and TINPC. The correlation was statistically significant for
age (r = 0.147, n = 13673, P < .0001), LOS (r = 0.502, n = 13
673, P < .0001) and number of items of drugs and supplies (r
= 0.376, n = 13 673, P < .0001).
An independent-sample t test was performed to determine
whether there were differences in the TINPC between males
and females and between medical and surgical cases sepa-
rately. There were differences in the TINPC between males
and females. The TINPC was higher among males (m = MYR
397.11, SD = 84.50) than among females (m = MYR 257.56,
SD = 68.89), and this difference was statistically significant,
m = 139.55, 95% CI = 112.97-166.13, t(10851.317) =10.292,
P < .001. Surgical procedures incurred a much higher TINPC
compared with medical cases, and this difference was statisti-
cally significant, m = 87.93, 95% CI = 61.00-114.85,
t(10132.631) = 6.402, P < .001 (Table 1). A 1-way between-
groups ANOVA was conducted to explore the impact of eth-
nicity and case severity on the TINPC. A statistically
significant difference was observed between ethnic groups as
determined by 1-way ANOVA, F(3, 13669) = 197.320, P <
.0001. The Tukey post hoc test revealed that the TINPC was
statistically significantly higher among patients of Indian eth-
nicity (MYR 613.93, SD = 98.41, P < .0001) and other eth-
nicities (MYR 578.47, SD = 144.51, P < .0001) compared
with Malay ethnicity (MYR 242.02, SD = 65.37, P < .0001)
and Chinese ethnicity (MYR 214.66, SD = 27.99, P < .0001),
respectively. There was a statistically significant difference
between the severity of cases groups, as determined by 1-way

ANOVA, F(2, 13670) = 1327.693, P < .0001. The Tukey post
hoc test revealed that the TINPC was statistically signifi-
cantly higher among patients with severity level III (MYR
1008.59, SD = 157.23, P < .0001) and patients with severity
level II (MYR 296.98, SD = 49.28, P < .0001) compared with
patients with severity level I (MYR 126.05, SD = 21.81, P <
.0001) (Table 1).
Multivariate Linear Regression Analysis
In backward elimination (or backward deletion), the vari-
ables of age and Indian ethnicity did not contribute to the
regression equation because their coefficients were statisti-
cally insignificant (P = .789, P = .162), respectively. The
multivariate linear regression analysis (after excluding of
age and Indian ethnicity) was statistically significant, and
overall, explained 32.7% of the variance in the TINPC, F(8,
13664) = 829.328, P < .0005.
The LOS and severity level III appeared to be the stron-
gest factors affecting the TINPC; followed by the number of
items of drugs and supplies and severity level II (Table 2).
Patients with a longer LOS in the hospital were more likely
to have high a TINPC (B = 0.349, P < .0005). Patients with
severity level III were more likely to have high TINPC (B =
0.253, P < .0005). Patients with more items of prescribed drugs
and supplies were more likely to have a high TINPC (B =
0.081, P < .0005). Patients with severity level II were more
likely to have high TINPC (B = 0.050, P < .0005). Patients who
had have undergone more complex procedures (surgical case)
were more likely to have a high TINPC (B = 0.020, P = .005).
Male patients were more likely to have a high TINPC than
female patients (B = 0.018, P = 0.010). Malay and Chinese eth-
nicities were more likely to have lower TINPC compared with
other ethnic groups (B = -14.141, P < .0005), (B = -13.901, P
< .0005), respectively (Table 2).
Discussion
It was an interesting exercise to examine factors that may
have impacted on the TINPC at UKMMC. However, it was
not possible to capture all possible factors. Only 32.7% of
the variation was explained; 67.3% of the variation remained
unexplained. Clearly, other factors may affect the TINPC.
In the multivariate regression analysis, LOS and severity
level III showed the strongest impact on the TINPC. These
factors appeared to have a significant and positive linear
association with the TINPC. After controlling for other fac-
tors, for each 1-day increase in LOS, there was an increase
approximately MYR 37.118 (equivalent to USD 11.97)
increase in TINPC per year; and for each increase in one case
of severity level III, there was an increase approximately
MYR 531.75 (equivalent to USD 171.53) in the TINPC per
year.
These outcomes are expected in a tertiary hospital such
UKMMC because the more severe cases are referred or
admitted. Most of these cases will be seen by the specialists
and consultants, who are more likely to prescribe high cost
and new generation drugs, as opposed to the first line or
generic drugs that are often prescribed for less severe cases
(level I and II).3,21 Moreover, patients with worse conditions
are likely to need longer hospitalization stays because they
must be transferred to the high dependency health service.
Consequently, they tend to consume more resources. These
patients usually presented with severe complications and
comorbidities.
Public health care continues to be the most popular choice
among Malaysians when seeking medical treatment, with a
significant increase in hospital admission (ie, 1.53% from
2010 to 2014). The percentage of total allocation to the
Ministry of Health Malaysia in the national budget has
increased from 8.02% in 2010 to 8.39% in 2014.22,23
In this study, the number of prescribed drugs and supplies
averaged of 8.18 (SD = 5.81), which is comparable to the 7.56
(SD = 3.37) items reported in an earlier study conducted by
Al-Junid et al (2007) at UKMMC.3 However, the number is
higher than the average number of 1.4 to 3.8 in South-East
Asian countries.24,25 Indeed, similarities and differences in
prescribing patterns and number of items have been reported
across different type of health organization.25 Various reasons
such as financial incentives, lack of therapeutic training, and

availability of drugs, result in prescribers increasing the num-
ber of drugs.24
The study results showed that the prescribed number of
drugs and supplies has a significant and positive association
with the TINPC; for each increase in an item of prescribed
drugs and supplies, there was an increase of approximately
MYR 10.553 (equivalent to USD 3.40) in the TINPC per
year. Al-Junid et al (2007) and his team found that higher
drug costs are related to an LOS of 6 or more days, severity
level II and III, and an increased number of prescribed
generic drugs (ie, 7 or more items).3
Demographic structure is undoubtedly one of the most
influential factors affecting the TINPC. Our study showed
that the patient's age has a significant and positive correla-
tion with the TINPC. More resources are used for older
patients, and more drugs are prescribed to them. This finding
could also result from the increasing health care demands
attributed to steady increase in life expectancy as well as an
aging population and wide spread chronic diseases in
Malaysia.1 Moreover, gender appears to affect the TINPC;
male patients seem to be associated with a higher TINPC
than female patients. For each increase in the number of
males, there was an increase of approximately MYR 28.378
(equivalent to USD 9.15) increase in the TINPC per year.
Note that the prescribed number of medications was higher
in male patients 60 years of age and older, with an average
LOS of more than 7 days.3
Surgical procedures may also increase the LOS and con-
tribute to high cost. UKMMC provides a tertiary referral ser-
vices at the primary emergency reception center. In this
study, surgical cases were significantly and positively related
to the TINPC compared with medical cases. For each
increase in the number of surgical procedure cases; there was
an increase of approximately MYR 31.432 (equivalent to
USD 10.14) in the TINPC per year.
Malay and Chinese ethnicities constituted up to 77.1% of
our total sample population. However, in the multivariate
regression analysis, these ethnicities unexpectedly contrib-
uted to a lower TINPC compared with Indian and other eth-
nicities; for each increase in cases of Malay and Chinese
patients, there was a decrease of approximately MYR
193.938 (equivalent to USD 62.56) and MYR 212.117
(equivalent to USD 68.42) in the TINPC per year, respec-
tively. Statistical differences have been reported in the inci-
dence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among the
multiethnic Malaysians.26 Teh et al (2011) found that the
rates of arthritis, diabetes, and ischemic heart diseases among
Malaysian Indians were higher than Malay and Chinese
people.27 Moreover, study conducted by Tan et al (2011)
revealed that Malaysian Indians experienced poor health
with high prevalence of metabolic syndrome than Malays
and Chinese.28 Patients with NCDs impose economic burden
on governments and households, because they need recurrent
use of medical services and long-term medications.29
In fact, comparison with similar findings was difficult and
restricted because most studies tend to correlate the predict-
ing factors with total hospital cost or drug cost rather than the
total pharmacy cost alone. However, most of these studies
reported that drugs and supplies constituted the highest per-
cent of total hospital cost,4,12-14,16 and LOS and severity of
cases are the primary drivers for health care cost.3,12-14,16
It is not clear what the implications of testing factors
against the TINPC are for policy makers in Malaysia.
However, any discussion of new strategies to address the
issues of pricing and even reimbursement policies should
consider the results of relevant pharmacoeconomic evalua-
tions. The findings of this study should be interpreted in
light of a number of limitations. Because of limited time
and resource constraints, this study was not designed to
cover a representative number of hospitals in Malaysia. A
limited number of factors were tested against the TINPC.
Therefore, our findings may not be generalizable to all
medical settings. However, we think that results of this
study will contribute greatly toward the establishment of
baseline data to service and advance policy makers and
health care providers to optimize and refine existing medi-
cine policies.
Conclusion
Pharmaceutical expenditures have generally been viewed as
a potentially driver of total health care expenditures.
Therefore, decision makers and pharmacy leaders are encour-
aged to stay appraised of important developments in research
methodology and health care policy to be effectively pre-
pared to address changes that might impact pharmacy spend-
ing. The analyses provided in this study focus on factors that
are more likely to influence inpatient pharmacy cost.
However, health care managers and pharmacy leaders should
also carefully monitor other factors that are related to outpa-
tient visits and patient day care and that are likely to impact
total pharmacy cost and, consequently total hospital costs.
Our study results suggest that more complicated cases result
in longer LOSs and that as more drugs and supplies are pre-
scribed, the TINPC increases.
