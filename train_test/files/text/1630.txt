Abstract
There has been extensive previous research examining the connection between obesity and food insecurity, 2 serious
nutrition challenges facing low-income children in the US. All of this work used BMI to categorize a child as obese.
Although BMI is one way to categorize the obesity status of a child, other measures have not been used to understand the
connection between food insecurity and obesity. In response, this study used multiple measures of obesity taken from the
2001 to 2004 NHANES. The sample included 2516 children between the ages of 8 and 17 y in households with annual
incomes ,200% of the poverty line. Within this sample, 36.6% of children were in food-insecure households. The
prevalence of obesity depended on the measure employed (BMI, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness, trunk fat
mass, body fat), with prevalence rates ranging from 15.4 to 44.8%. Logistic regression models estimated the probability of
a child being obese using multiple measures of obesity conditional on food-insecurity status and other covariates. The
results indicated that food-insecure children were no more likely to be obese than their food-secure counterparts across all
measures of obesity. This relationship held after controlling for other factors and examining subpopulations based on race/
ethnicity, gender, and race/ethnicity and gender. These results suggest that efforts to alleviate food insecurity and
childhood obesity will work independently. J. Nutr. 139: 1173­1178, 2009.
Introduction
The problem of pediatric obesity in the United States has been
well documented (1,2). As measured by BMI, recent estimates
indicate that almost 1 in 5 children are considered obese (1).
Both genetic (3,4) and environmental (5­7) factors contribute to
the energy imbalance that leads to obesity. Another public health
concern in the US is food insecurity. A household is considered
food insecure if it does not have the financial means to access
enough food for all household members to sustain active,
healthy living (8). Approximately 1 in 5 children in the US lives
in a food-insecure household as measured via the USDA Core
Food Security Module (CFSM)6 with substantially higher rates
for those below the poverty line (8). Both obesity and food
insecurity have been shown to lead to a plethora of medical
problems for children (9­15).
Research on the relationship between food insecurity and
childhood obesity has lead to mixed results. Some studies have
found a positive relationship (16­19), others have found no
relationship (10,20­25), others have found a negative relation-
ship (26­28), and 1 study found that the relationship depended
on whether self-reported or measured heights and weights were
used (29). Food insecurity has also been found to influence
obesity through its interaction with stress (30,31) and with
depression, parenting, and infant feeding (32). This work has
used a variety of data sets and methods. Common to all these
studies is the use of a child's BMI to delineate whether he or she
is obese, overweight, healthy weight, or underweight.
The central advantage of using BMI to establish the weight
status of a child is that, compared with other measures of obesity,
stature and weight are considered the easiest and most reliable
measures to obtain across the wide range of settings in which
routine preventive screenings are conducted (33). A key disad-
vantage is that excessive body fatness is the pathology associated
with obesity and it cannot be measured directly using BMI insofar
as BMI does not distinguish between mass in the form of fat, lean
tissue, or bone (33,34). Additionally, gender- and age-specific
BMI-derived guidelines are confounded by the onset of puberty
(34) and are not appropriate for children with contractures or
deformities (33). Therefore, scientists argue that multiple mea-
sures of childhood obesity should be assessed (34­36).
In addition to BMI not presenting a full picture of obesity,
research has shown that connections between obesity and child

used. For example, compared with BMI, waist circumference
(WC) and waist:height ratios were better predictors of cardio-
vascular disease risk factors (37), WC and hypertiglyceridemic
waist phenotype were better predictors of metabolic syndrome
(38,39), and fat mass was more closely associated with physical
activity (40). Moreover, the distribution of obesity within
populations (e.g. by race and by sex) differs depending on
which measure of obesity is used (41­44). Just as relationships
between obesity and health outcomes differ by choice of
measure, the same may be true for the relationship between
childhood obesity and food insecurity.
Within the obesity literature, there is no consensus on which
measure of obesity is preferable in all instances (45). As a
consequence, we used a wide variety of measures [BMI, WC,
triceps skinfold (TSF), trunk fat mass, percentage of body fat]
and their respective obesity cutoffs. We analyzed these relation-
ships for children between the ages of 8 and 17 y with data from
the 2001­2004 NHANES.
Methods
Participants
Participants were from the 2001­2004 waves of the NHANES, which is
a program of studies conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics, CDC (46) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults
and children in the United States. NHANES examines a nationally
representative sample of ;5000 persons each year, about one-half of
whom are children (46). The NHANES samples examined for these
analyses were limited to households , 200% of the poverty line, because
food insecurity is rare among households above this threshold (8). The
resulting sample included 2516 children (1239 girls, 1277 boys) between
the ages of 8 and 17 y.
Measures
Classification of weight status. All physical assessments of the child
(e.g. height, weight, WC) were measured by a trained technician in the
NHANES mobile examination center. We derived 5 indicators of obesity
from this information. In each instance, if a child was not classified as
obese, we referred to the child as being nonobese. First, BMI (kg/m2) was
calculated from the child's weight and height and mapped into a
percentile using age- and sex-specific reference values obtained from
CDC growth charts for the US (47). A child was classified as obese if his
or her BMI was $ the 95th percentile. Second, WC was measured at just
above the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium at the end of a
normal expiration. A child was classified as obese if his or her WC was $
the 90th percentile reference value for their age and sex in models for the
full population or by gender, and their age, sex, and race in models by
race (48). Third, TSF thickness was determined at the midpoint between
the acromion and olecranon process on the posterior surface of the right
arm with a Lange caliper. A child was classified as centrally obese if his or
her TSF was $ the 95th percentile reference value for their age and sex in
models for the full population or by gender, or age, sex, and race in
models by race (49,50). Fourth, trunk fat mass was determined using
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. The trunk included the thoracic and
lumbar spine, and left and right ribs and pelvis. A child was classified as
obese if his or her trunk fat mass was greater than or equal to established
age-sex reference values for identifying high trunk fat mass (51). Our
final indicator of obesity was percentage of whole-body fat measured via
whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans taken with a
Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer. Hologic software version
8.26:a3* was used to administer all scans. For the scans, children wore
disposable paper gowns, removed all objects that would interfere with
obtaining an analyzable scan image, and were positioned supine on the
tabletop with their feet in a neutral position and hands flat by their side
(52). A child was classified as obese if his or her percentage of body fat
was $ the 95th percentile reference value for their age and sex (34).
Food insecurity. Food insecurity was measured using the same
methodology employed by the USDA, a well-established and reliable
methodology that has been used in the official classifications of food
insecurity since the mid-1990s (8). Defined over a 12-mo period, a series
of 18 questions taken from the CFSM was posed to NHANES mothers;
the full set of questions can be found in Supplemental Table 1. As done
with the official measures (8), a household with #2 affirmative responses
to the CFSM was categorized as food secure and a household with $3
affirmative responses was categorized as food insecure.
Confounders. Several demographic characteristics were included as
covariates in the multivariate analyses. Each has been related to children's
weight status and the food insecurity status of the child's household
(10,16­32). These cofounders included the child's age (y), race/ethnicity
(Hispanic of any race, non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White, other),
gender, and annual household income divided by the poverty line.
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were calculated for the total sample, by race/ethnicity
(non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic), by gender, and by
race/ethnicity and gender. Comparisons between the obesity statuses of
food-insecure and food-secure children were made for each of the obesity
measures. To test for the statistical significance of differences, x2 tests were
used. Logistic regression models were estimated to assess the association
between childhood obesity and food insecurity, controlling for other factors
(i.e. the list of confounders above). The bivariate comparisons and logistic
regression models were conducted on the full sample and subsamples of
non-Hispanic White children, non-Hispanic Black children, Hispanic
children, girls, and boys. We further estimated the logistic regression
models for each of the race/ethnicity categories separately for girls and boys
(i.e. White non-Hispanic girls, Black non-Hispanic girls, Hispanic girls,
White non-Hispanic boys, Black non-Hispanic boys, and Hispanic boys).
As described above, when race-specific obesity cutoffs were available, we
used these in our subsample analyses. In light of the oversampling of
Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks in the NHANES, we used the sampling
weights supplied by the NHANES for all estimations (48). All analyses
were conducted using Stata Version 10 for Windows (53).
Results
The sample when weighted was 44% non-Hispanic White, 22%
non-Hispanic Black, and 26% Hispanic (Table 1). Fifty-two
percent of the children were males and the mean age of the child
was 12 y. The mean income:poverty line ratio was 1.04. Regard-
ing our key variables of interests, nearly 37% of the households
were food insecure and for the 5 measures of childhood obesity,
the range of obese children varied from 15 to 45%. Specifically,
18% of children were considered obese via BMI assessments,
21% via WC, 15% via TSF thickness, 30% via trunk fat mass,
and 45% via body fat. Along with the proportions defined as
obese differing markedly by obesity measure, there were also
differences within measures by race/ethnicity and by gender.
Next, we broke down food insecurity status by whether a child
was obese or not obese according to the 5 measures of obesity
noted above (Table 2). Bivariate x2 results for the entire sample
and for each of the subsamples showed that food-insecure children
were no more likely to be obese than their food-secure counter-
parts across the 5 measures of obesity. It should be noted, however,
that food insecurity and obesity often coexist in low-income
children, because, depending on the obesity measure and subsam-
ple assessed, 12­57% of food-insecure children were also obese.
We used logistic regressions to control for other factors. The
association between food insecurity and obesity was nonsignif-
icant at usual confidence levels for the sample of all children for
all 5 measures of obesity (Table 3). The nonsignificance of the
relationship between food insecurity and obesity also held when

we limited the sample to non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic
Blacks, and Hispanics, as well as by girls and boys. In addition,
when we assessed the association between food insecurity and
obesity status for race by gender subgroups (e.g. White non-
Hispanic girls) (results not tabulated), all relationships were
nonsignificant across all subgroups for all 5 measures of obesity.
Discussion
Food insecurity and childhood obesity were not associated for
children between the ages of 8 and 17 y in households with
incomes ,200% of the poverty line. This was true when we
examined the full sample and when we broke down the sample
by gender, race/ethnicity, and gender and race/ethnicity. These

results are consistent with recent findings of no relationship
between food insecurity and childhood obesity (10,20­24). We
emphasize that our results held across a wide array of obesity
measures. Previous findings of no relationship between food
insecurity and childhood obesity were based only on the BMI
of the child. Our results demonstrate that the findings from
these previous studies may also be robust to other obesity
measures.
Despite finding no association between food insecurity and
childhood obesity, an important point (and paradox) still
remains: food insecurity and overweight coexist in low-income
children. In our sample, depending on the obesity measure, 12­
57% of food-insecure children were obese. The possible reasons
why food-insecure children are also obese may include over-
consumption of cheaper, energy-dense foods (54,55), overeating
during times when food is more plentiful (56), metabolic
changes to ensure a more efficient use of energy (57), different
standards of what constitutes an adequate diet (58), parents
overprotecting their children by giving them more food than
needed when food is available (59), and the mother being food
insecure during pregnancy (60).
Low-income, food-insecure children may be obese due to
other factors associated with residing in a low-income house-
hold. As noted in the annual reports on food insecurity in the
United States (8), households with lower incomes (vs. those with
higher incomes), households headed by a Black non-Hispanic or
Hispanic person (vs. households headed by a White non-
Hispanic person), and households headed by a single person
(vs. households headed by a married couple) are all more likely
to be food insecure. These are all factors that have been
associated with childhood obesity (1,61­65).
Four limitations of this study and subsequent directions for
future research warrant mention. First, we were unable to
examine associations with food insecurity specifically for the
child in question. As the availability of food to eat may vary
among the members in a household, analyses testing the
relationship between food insecurity and weight status for a
particular child are needed (22,31). Second, compared with
other data sets, the NHANES more precisely measures the
physical characteristics of children, but it does not have as rich a
set of socioeconomic confounders and income is not as precisely
measured. Future researchers on this topic may wish to use other
data sources with richer sets of possible cofounders. To the best
of our knowledge, a data set that provides measures of the
physical characteristics of children as precise as those in the
NHANES and also has a rich set confounders does not exist for
the US. Third, we have not made any causal claims about the
relationship between food insecurity and childhood obesity.
Future researchers may wish to utilize data sets and empirical
models that allow for establishing causality. Fourth, we did not
consider the potential effect of dietary intake and physical
activity on childhood obesity. Future work might consider how
the interaction of these factors is associated with food insecurity
and childhood obesity.
In conclusion, we emphasize policy implications of our
work. Alleviating food insecurity and childhood obesity have
been priorities among policymakers. Policymakers have tools
to address these issues. Chief among food programs is the Food
Stamp Program. Previous work has presented some evidence
that food stamps help to alleviate food insecurity (66­70).
Along with food stamps, policymakers can use other programs
such as the National School Lunch Program, the Temporary
Assistance to Needy Families program, and the Earned Income
Tax Credit to aid low-income families in meeting the food
needs of their children. Regarding childhood obesity, school
fitness programs and, more broadly, nutrition and wellness
programs have had some success in combating child weight
issues. Our findings that food insecurity and obesity are not
associated mean that policymakers can address the dual
problems of alleviating food insecurity and childhood obesity
without worrying about possible negative spillovers from one
to the other.
