Sexual Assault Case Outcomes:
Disentangling the Overlapping Decisions
of Police and Prosecutors
Cassia Spohn and Katharine Tellis
The rape reform movement of the 1970s and 1980s was designed to improve
the likelihood of prosecution and conviction in sexual assault cases. How-
ever, there is evidence that the attrition rate for sexual assaults reported
to the police remains high, and that the locus of case attrition is arresting
and charging decisions. In this paper, we analyze police and prosecutorial
decision-making in sexual assault cases using quantitative data on sexual
assaults reported to the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department in 2008. We argue that decisions made by
police and prosecutors should not be examined in isolation from one
another and that researchers who analyze arrest decisions by examining only
cases that are formally cleared by arrest or who focus only on charging
decisions that follow the arrest of a suspect may be ignoring important
aspects of police and prosecutorial decision-making. This is confirmed by
the results of our study, which reveal that a significant proportion of cases
in which the police appear to have probable cause to make an arrest do not
result in the arrest of the suspect and that a substantial number of cases
are rejected for prosecution by the district attorney before an arrest is
made. Moreover, the factors that predict arrest and charging vary depend-
ing upon the way in which the outcome is operationally defined. These
results have a number of important policy implications for police and prose-
cutors handling sexual assault cases.

More than three decades after the inception of the rape reform movement,
which saw significant changes to the definition of rape, elimination of resis-
tance and corroboration requirements, and enactment of rape shield laws
(Estrich, 1987; Spohn & Horney, 1992), the response of the criminal justice sys-
tem to the crime of sexual assault remains highly problematic. Victims are
reluctant to report crimes to the police and, when they do, are often met with
skepticism and suspicion on the part of police and prosecutors. This results in
a substantial number of cases being unfounded, a low arrest rate, and shock-
ingly low rates of prosecution and conviction (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Spohn
& Tellis, 2014).
In this paper, we analyze police and prosecutorial decision-making in sexual
assault cases using data on sexual assaults reported to the Los Angeles Police
Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) in 2008.
Using Black's (1976, 1980, 1989) sociological theory of law and the focal con-
cerns perspective developed to explain judges' sentencing decisions (Steffens-
meier, Ulmer, & Kramer, 1998), we examine the effects of victim
characteristics, indicators of case seriousness, and measures of evidentiary
strength on the decision to arrest and the decision to charge, with both deci-
sions conceptualized in multiple ways. We contend that decisions made by
police and prosecutors cannot be examined in isolation from one another and
that researchers who analyze arrest decisions by examining only cases that are
formally cleared by arrest or who focus only on charging decisions that follow
the arrest of a suspect may be ignoring important aspects of police and prose-
cutorial decision-making. They also may be reaching misleading conclusions
about the factors that influence arrest and charging decisions. Our goal in this
study is to disentangle these overlapping decisions and, in so doing, to illumi-
nate the ways in which the policies and practices of these law enforcement
agencies contribute to high rates of case attrition in sexual assault cases.
Prior Research on Sexual Assault Case Outcomes
There is compelling evidence that sexual assault is a seriously underreported
crime. Tjaden and Thoennes (2006, p. 33), who analyzed the results of the
National Violence Against Women Survey, found that only 19.1 percent of
women who were raped since their 18th birthday reported the crime; a similar
survey in Canada found that only 6 percent of sexual assaults were reported to
the police (Du Mont, Miller, & Myhr, 2003). There is also evidence that victims
of sexual assault who report the crime and are willing to cooperate with police
and prosecutors as the case moves forward may confront criminal justice offi-
cials who are skeptical of their allegations and who question their credibility
(Estrich, 1987). The process begins with the police, who decide whether a
crime has occurred, the amount of investigative resources to devote to identi-
fying the suspect, whether to make an arrest of an identified suspect and, if
so, the charges to file, and whether to refer the case to the prosecutor. These
2 SPOHN AND TELLIS
"gatekeeping" (Kerstetter, 1990) decisions, which largely determine the fate
of the case, do not necessarily produce the outcome--arrest and successful
prosecution--that the victim expected. As Taylor (1987, p. 89) explains, "After
giving a valid rape report and fully cooperating with the police, a woman may
find herself in the unexpected and bewildering predicament of having come to
the police for aid ... only to have the door slammed firmly in her face."
There is very limited research on police decision-making in sexual assault
cases and much of the research that does exist is dated. Researchers have
examined the decision to unfound the charges (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Ker-
stetter, 1990; LaFree, 1989; Spohn, White, & Tellis, 2014), the decision to
make an arrest (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Bachman, 1998; Bouffard, 2000; Du
Mont & Myhr, 2000; Horney & Spohn, 1996; LaFree, 1981), the decision to pre-
sent the case to the prosecutor for charge evaluation (Alderden & Ullman,
2012; Spohn & Tellis, 2014), as well as the victim's decision to cooperate in
the investigation of the crime (Alderden & Long, 2016). These studies reveal
that police decision-making is influenced by a combination of legal and extra-
legal factors. An early study (LaFree, 1981), for example, found that the deci-
sion to arrest was affected by the victim's ability to identify the suspect, the
victim's willingness to prosecute, whether the victim engaged in any type of
misconduct at the time of the incident, the promptness of the victim's report,
whether the victim was assaulted by an acquaintance rather than a stranger,
and the suspect's use of a weapon. On the other hand, the arrest decision was
not affected by the victim's race, whether the victim resisted, the location of
the incident, whether there was a witness who could corroborate the victim's
allegations, or whether the victim was injured. These findings led LaFree
(1981, p. 592) to conclude that the emphasis on the role played by the victim's
background characteristics was "greatly overstated" and that "legally relevant
variables were paramount." However, more recent research calls this conclu-
sion into question. Bouffard (2000) found that arrest was more likely if the vic-
tim and suspect had a prior relationship, the victim agreed to undergo a sexual
assault exam, and the credibility/seriousness score of the crime was higher.
Alderden and Ullman (2012) similarly found that police decision-making was
determined primarily by extra-legal factors--the victim's preference for how
the case should be handled, discrepancies in victim statements, and victim
resistance, while Schuller and Stewart (2000) found that police officers'
responses to sexual assault vignettes were affected by the intoxication and
credibility of the complainant.
The findings regarding prosecutors' charging decisions in sexual assault cases
are very similar. This research, which is much more extensive than the
research on police decision-making, reveals that although these decisions are
strongly influenced by legally relevant factors such as the seriousness of the
crime, the offender's prior criminal record, and the strength of the evidence
in the case (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Frazier & Haney, 1996; Kingsnorth,
MacIntosh, & Wentworth, 1999; Spohn & Holleran, 2001; Tellis & Spohn, 2008),
victim characteristics also play a role. Studies have documented the influence
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 3
of the victim's age, occupation, and education (McCahill, Meyer, & Fischman,
1979), "risk-taking" behavior such as hitchhiking, drinking, or using drugs
(Alderden & Ullman, 2012; LaFree, 1981; Lord & Rassel, 2000; McCahill et al.,
1979; Spohn & Holleran, 2001; Tellis & Spohn, 2008), and the character or rep-
utation of the victim (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Feldman-Summers & Lindner,
1976; Field & Bienen, 1980; Martin & Powell, 1994; McCahill et al., 1979;
Reskin & Visher, 1986; Spohn, Beichner, & Davis-Frenzel, 2001).
Research also has demonstrated that the relationship between the victim
and the accused has a significant effect on charging decisions in sexual assault
cases. Consistent with Black's (1976) relational distance theory, these studies
conclude that reports of sexual assaults by strangers are less likely than
reports of sexual assaults by acquaintances or intimate partners to be rejected
by the prosecutor (Alderden & Ullman, 2012; Spohn et al., 2001; Tellis &
Spohn, 2008); sexual assaults involving strangers also are more likely to result
in police and prosecutor agreement on the severity of charges to be filed (Hol-
leran, Beichner, & Spohn, 2010). Other studies find that different predictors
affect charging decisions in stranger and acquaintance cases (Kingsnorth et al.,
1999; Spohn & Holleran, 2001). Spohn and Holleran (2001), for example, found
that characteristics of the victim affected charging decisions only in cases
involving non-strangers and that the suspect's use of a gun or knife affected
charging only in cases involving strangers.
Two studies used qualitative data to explore in more detail the reasons why
prosecutors reject charges in sexual assault cases (Frohmann, 1991; Spohn
et al., 2001; see also, Frohmann, 1997). The notion that decisions in rape
cases are affected by the "typifications of rape held by processing agents"
(LaFree, 1989, p. 241) plays a central role in the research conducted by Froh-
mann (1991, 1997), who used data gathered during observations of the case
screening process and interviews with prosecutors to analyze explanations of
and justifications for case rejection. Frohmann (1991) asserted that prosecu-
tors' concerns about convictability led them to question the credibility of the
rape victim and the veracity of her story. She found that prosecutors used
inconsistencies in the vicitm's story, incongruities between the victim's
account and prosecutors' beliefs about "typical" rapes, and assertions about
ulterior motives on the part of the victim to justify case rejection. Spohn and
her colleagues (Spohn et al., 2001) used data on sexual assaults cleared by
arrest in Miami to replicate and extend Frohmann's (1991) research. Their
examination of prosecutors' written justifications for rejecting charges in these
cases led them to conclude that the prosecutor's assessment of the likelihood
of conviction was based on factors other than typifications of rape and rape
victims. In a substantial number of their cases, the decision to reject charges
could be traced to the victim's failure to appear for a pre-file interview, the
victim's refusal to cooperate in the prosecution of the case, or the victim's
admission that the charges were fabricated. As they noted, in these types of
cases "the odds of conviction were low (or nonexistent), not because the pros-
ecutor believed that the facts in the case contradicted potential jurors'
4 SPOHN AND TELLIS
assumptions about rape and rape victims, but because the unavailability of a
victim who was willing to testify made it impossible to proceed with the case"
(Spohn et al., 2001, p. 228).
In summary, prior research on police and prosecutorial decisions in sexual
assault cases suggests that these decisions are affected by a combination of
legal and extra-legal factors. As they evaluate cases and assess the likelihood
of prosecution and conviction, police and prosecutors consider, not only the
seriousness of the offense and the strength of evidence against the defendant,
but also the characteristics, behavior, and reputation of the victim, the rela-
tionship between the victim and the suspect, and the willingness of the victim
to cooperate in the investigation of the case.
Theoretical Perspectives on Police and Prosecutor Decision Making
Research on police and prosecutor decision-making is somewhat a-theoretical.
Black (1976, 1980, 1989) contended that police decision-making "is predictable
from the sociological theory of law," which holds that the quantity of law
applied in any particular situation depends on factors such as the social status
of those involved, the relational distance between the parties, and the degree
of informal social control to which the parties are subjected. In discussing the
investigation of crimes by detectives, Black (1980) argued that the amount of
time and energy that will be devoted to a case will depend, not only on the seri-
ousness of the crime, but on the social status, background, reputation, and
credibility of the victim and suspect. Although this perspective has not been
applied to decisions made by prosecutors, it clearly is relevant. Prosecutors,
like police, will devote more resources to cases that have a strong likelihood of
a successful outcome.
Another theoretical perspective applicable to decision-making in sexual
assault cases is the focal concerns perspective (Steffensmeier et al., 1998).
Although this perspective was developed to explain judges' sentencing deci-
sions, it has been applied to prosecutors' charging decisions (see, for example,
Spohn et al., 2001) and, as we explain below, is also relevant to police deci-
sion-making. According to this perspective, judges' sentencing decisions are
guided by three focal concerns: their assessment of the blameworthiness of
the offender; their desire to protect the community by incapacitating danger-
ous offenders or deterring potential offenders; and their concerns about the
practical consequences, or social costs, of sentencing decisions. The first focal
concern--offender blameworthiness--reflects judges' assessments of the seri-
ousness of the crime, the offender's prior criminal record, and the offender's
motivation and role in the offense. By contrast, the second focal concern--
protecting the community--rests on judges' perceptions of the dangerousness
and threat posed by the offender and the offender's likelihood of recidivism.
Judges' concerns about the practical consequences or social costs of sentenc-
ing decisions reflect their perceptions regarding the offender's ability "to do
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 5
time" and the costs of incarcerating offenders with medical conditions, mental
health problems, or dependent children, as well as their concerns about main-
taining relationships with other members of the courtroom workgroup and pro-
tecting the reputation of the court.
We suggest that the focal concerns that guide police and prosecutor deci-
sion-making in sexual assault cases are similar, but not identical, to those that
guide judges' sentencing decisions. Like judges, police officers and prosecuting
attorneys consider the seriousness of the crime, the degree of injury to the
victim, and the blameworthiness and dangerousness of the offender. They also
are concerned about the practical consequences or social costs of their deci-
sions, but their concerns focus more on the likelihood of conviction than the
costs of incarceration. Although, technically, police decisions to unfound the
report or arrest the suspect do not rest on an assessment of convictability, as
a practical matter the police do take this into consideration. They view the
decision to arrest as the first step in the process of securing a conviction in
the case; as a result, they are reluctant to make arrests that are unlikely to
lead to the filing of charges against the suspect.
We suggest that this concern with convictability creates what Frohmann
(1997, p. 535) refers to as a "downstream orientation" to decision makers who
will handle the case at subsequent stages of the process. Whereas Frohmann
(1997), whose work focused on charging decisions in sexual assault cases, argued
that prosecutors consider how the judge, jury, and defense attorney will react
to the case, we contend that the downstream orientation of detectives investi-
gating sexual assault cases is to the prosecutors who make filing decisions. That
is, detectives attempt to predict how prosecutors will assess and respond to the
case. Because prosecutors' assessments of cases are based on a standard of con-
victability that encourages them "to accept only `strong' or `winnable' cases for
prosecution" (Frohmann, 1991, p. 215), this means that detectives' decisions
similarly will reflect their assessment of the likelihood of conviction should an
arrest be made. In sexual assault cases, in which the victim's testimony is cru-
cial, these assessments rest squarely on an evaluation of the victim's credibility.
As a result, if the victim's allegations are inconsistent or do not comport with
detectives' beliefs about the typical sexual assault or if the detective believes
that the victim has ulterior motives for reporting the crime or will not cooperate
as the case moves forward, the likelihood of arrest will decrease.
Both the sociological theory of law and the focal concerns perspective sug-
gest that the "social structure" (Black, 1989) of the case influences how the
case will be handled. As Black (1989, p. 21) put it, "the handling of a case
always reflects the social characteristics of those involved in it." Similarly, the
focal concerns perspective holds that the limited information available about
the case, especially at early stages in the process, means that decision makers
will "rely on attributional decision-making processes that invoke societal
stereotypes" (Johnson & Betsinger, 2009, p. 1055). In the context of police
and prosecutor decision-making generally and decisions to arrest and charge
specifically, these perspectives suggest not only that the social status of the
6 SPOHN AND TELLIS
complainant and suspect will be influential, but that stereotypes of "real
rapes" (Estrich, 1987) and "genuine victims" (LaFree, 1989) will also play a
role. Thus, decisions to arrest and to charge the suspect will be based on a
combination of factors related to crime seriousness and victim credibility.
These perspectives suggest that arrest and prosecution will be more likely if
the crime is serious, the victim and suspect are strangers, the victim was
injured, the victim's allegations are consistent with detectives' "typifications
of rape scenarios" (Frohmann, 1991, p. 217), and the victim is viewed as credi-
ble and without ulterior motives for making allegations against the suspect.
The Current Study
The purpose of this study is to examine the decisions made by police and pros-
ecutors in sexual assault cases and to identify the predictors of those decisions
(Spohn & Tellis, 2012). As noted above, the focal concerns perspective sug-
gests that police and prosecutorial decisions in these types of cases will be
affected by a combination of legally relevant indicators of crime seriousness
and evidentiary strength and legally irrelevant victim characteristics. Our pur-
pose also is to demonstrate the ways in which police and prosecutorial deci-
sions overlap. To illustrate this, we present descriptive data on case outcomes
and we analyze arrest and charging decisions using multiple indicators of those
outcomes. Our results indicate that the conclusions one would draw regarding
the factors that influence outcomes in sexual assault cases vary depending
upon the way in which arrest and charging decisions are conceptualized.
In the next section, we discuss the policies and practices that guide the
investigation and prosecution of sexual assault cases in Los Angeles County. This
information was gleaned from interviews conducted with detectives and assis-
tant district attorneys (ADAs) who handle sexual assault cases in Los Angeles.1
Policies and Practices in the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual
Assault Cases
Los Angeles Law Enforcement Agencies
Reports of sexual assault are handled differently by the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) and the LASD. Crimes reported to the LAPD are initially
1. To enhance our understanding of policies and practices that guided the handling of sexual
assault cases and to enable us to more accurately interpret the quantitative data, we also con-
ducted interviews with LAPD and LASD detectives who had experience investigating sexual assaults,
and ADAs from the Victim Impact Program (VIP). During June and July of 2010, we interviewed 52
detectives from the LAPD, 24 detectives from the LASD, and 30 attorneys from the Los Angeles
County District Attorney's Office. For a more detailed description of the policies and procedures in
Los Angeles, see (Spohn & Tellis, 2014).
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 7
handled by a uniformed patrol officer in one of the LAPD's 21 divisions. The
responding officer will prepare the initial report of the crime based on the
statements of the victim and witnesses (if any); included will be a description
of the suspect and, if known, identifying information about the suspect. If the
crime was reported promptly, the responding officer also will collect evidence
from the scene of the crime and from the victim and, if she agrees, transport
the victim to a rape treatment center or other medical facility for a forensic
medical exam. The case is then investigated by one of the detectives in that
division who handles sex crimes.
The LASD has (or, rather, had at the time of data collection) a bifurcated
approach to the investigation of sexual assault based on the age of the victim.
Crimes involving victims 18 years old or older are handled in much the same
way as are all sexual assaults reported to the LAPD; the initial report is taken
by a sheriff's deputy in the jurisdiction where the crime occurred and the case
is then assigned to a detective from the station house in that jurisdiction.
Crimes involving victims under the age of 18 are referred to the Special Vic-
tims Bureau; detectives assigned to this unit take the report from the victim
and investigate the crime.
For both the LAPD and the LASD, the follow-up investigation of a sexual
assault is handled by the detective assigned to the case, who will pursue leads,
interview the victim and any witnesses, and attempt to identify, locate, and
interview the suspect. If the detective believes that the complaint is false or
baseless, s/he can unfound the report. If there is an identified suspect and
probable cause to make an arrest, the detective can clear the case by arrest
or, under specified circumstances, by exceptional means. If a suspect has not
been identified or there is not probable cause to make an arrest, the case can
be kept open or, in the vernacular of the LAPD, "IC'd" (investigation continu-
ing).
Los Angeles District Attorney's Office
Since 2001, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office has had a special-
ized sex crimes unit, the VIP, that vertically prosecutes sexual assault. Each of
the 11 branches of the District Attorney's Office utilizes a VIP team approach,
with an experienced attorney designated as the VIP Deputy-in-Charge (DIC).
The VIP DIC works closely with the ADAs assigned to the VIP team to ensure
that sexual assault cases are appropriately prepared and prosecuted. All ADAs
assigned to a VIP team receive enhanced, on-going training focusing on legal
issues, potential defenses, and trial tactics.
Although all of the prosecutors interviewed for this project affirmed that
the VIP is philosophically committed to the notion of vertical prosecution,
many noted that the case screening process varied by branch and by the VIP
DIC. In some branches case screening and filing decisions are handled by the
DIC, in others there is a designated case screener, and in still others all
8 SPOHN AND TELLIS
members of the VIP team participate in case screening and make filing deci-
sions. In branches where "everyone screens cases," if the ADA screening the
case decides to file charges, s/he is assigned to prosecute the case. As one
respondent noted, "After filing, we own the case so we take the filing decision
very seriously." Another respondent expressed a more cynical attitude, noting
that "If you file the dog, you walk the dog." In some branches, the VIP DIC
screens cases initially and decides whether the case should be rejected; cases
that are not rejected outright are assigned to a member of the VIP team, who
will conduct the pre-filing interview with the victim and decide whether
charges should be filed and, if so, what the charges should be. In other
branches, the VIP DIC conducts the interview with the victim and makes the
filing decision; cases that are filed are assigned to a member of the VIP team
for prosecution.
It is important to point out that the standard used by the Los Angeles
County District Attorney's Office in screening cases is a trial sufficiency stan-
dard (Jacoby, 1980). That is, the ADA will file charges only if there is sufficient
evidence to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt at a jury trial. More-
over, the policy in sexual assault cases is that charges will not be filed without
some type of corroboration of the victim's testimony--DNA evidence that
establishes the identity of the perpetrator, injuries to the victim, witnesses
who can corroborate the victim's testimony, or physical or medical evidence
that is consistent with the victim's account of the incident. Although there are
some exceptions, a pre-filing interview designed to assess the victim's credibil-
ity and willingness to cooperate in the prosecution of the case also is required.
The Process of Case Clearance
According to the Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook (Federal Bureau of Inves-
tigation, 2004), law enforcement agencies can clear offenses either by arrest
or by exceptional means. The handbook states that "an offense is cleared by
arrest, or solved for crime reporting purposes, when at least one person is
(1) arrested, (2) charged with the commission of the offense, and (3) turned
over to the court for prosecution (whether following arrest, court summons, or
police notice)" (p. 79). Regarding exceptional clearances, the handbook notes
that there may be occasions where law enforcement has conducted an investi-
gation, exhausted all leads, and identified a suspect but is nonetheless unable
to clear an offense by arrest. In this situation, the agency can clear the
offense by exceptional means, provided that each of the following questions
can be answered in the affirmative (pp. 80Â­81):
Â· Has the investigation definitely established the identity of the offender?
Â· Is the exact location of the offender known so that the subject could be
taken into custody now?
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 9
Â· Is there enough information to support an arrest, charge,2 and turning over
to the court for prosecution?
Â· Is there some reason outside law enforcement control that precludes
arresting, charging, and prosecuting the offender?
To illustrate the types of cases that might be cleared by exceptional means,
the handbook provides a list of examples, many of which involve the death of
the offender or an offender who is unable to be arrested because s/he is being
prosecuted in another jurisdiction for a different crime or because extradition
has been denied. One of the examples provided is when the "victim refuses to
cooperate in the prosecution," but there is an added proviso, which states that
this alone does not justify an exceptional clearance and that the answer must
also be yes to the first three questions outlined above (Federal Bureau of
Investigation, 2004, p. 81).
Analysis of case outcomes and interviews with detectives and district attor-
neys revealed that both the LAPD and the LASD have complicated rules for
clearing cases, misinterpret UCR guidelines regarding the two types of case
clearances (cleared by arrest and cleared by exceptional means), and overuse
(misuse) the exceptional clearance (for a more detailed discussion of this pro-
cess, see Spohn & Tellis, 2011). If the detective investigating the crime has
identified a suspect and has probable cause to arrest the suspect, the detec-
tive will either arrest the individual and present the case to an ADA from the
VIP of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office for a filing decision, or
delay making an arrest and present the case to an ADA for a pre-arrest charge
evaluation.
The ADA reviewing the case following the arrest of the suspect can either
accept the case for prosecution, send the case back to the investigating officer
(IO) for further investigation (although this is complicated by the fact that
charges must be filed within 48 hours of the suspect's arrest), send the case to
the city attorney for prosecution as a misdemeanor, or decline the case for
prosecution. Because LAPD policy states that cases can be cleared by arrest
only if the district attorney files charges, if charges are declined, the LAPD
detective changes the case clearance category from cleared by arrest to
cleared by exceptional means. The LASD does not have a similar policy, but,
depending on the preferences of the detective's supervisor and/or the detec-
tive's own interpretation of UCR policies on exceptional clearances, a LASD
detective may also recategorize the case from cleared by arrest to cleared by
exceptional means if the district attorney declines to file charges against the
suspect. Because the UCR Handbook clearly states that cases can be cleared
by exceptional means only if there is something beyond the control of law
enforcement that prevents them from making an arrest, this is a misuse of the
2. This refers to a police booking procedure; not a prosecutorial filing decision (FBI Section Chief
R. Casey, personal communication, January 14, 2011).

exceptional clearance. Cases in which a suspect is arrested should be cleared
by arrest, regardless of whether charges are filed by the district attorney.
Similar procedures are followed if the case is evaluated by the district attor-
ney prior to the arrest of the suspect. If the evidence in the case meets the
district attorney's standard for filing, the suspect will be arrested and the case
will be cleared by arrest. If the case is sent back for further investigation or if
the evidence is deemed insufficient to justify charging, the IO will either con-
tinue the investigation and, once additional evidence is obtained, resubmit the
case for a second review by the district attorney, or--and this is what more
typically happens--end the investigation and clear the case by exceptional
means. This, too, may be a misuse of the exceptional clearance. If the detec-
tive has probable cause to make an arrest but the victim tells the district
attorney that she does not want the suspect arrested or is unwilling to cooper-
ate in the prosecution of the case, the case can be cleared by exceptional
means (provided that the identity and location of the suspect are known).
Although one might argue that the suspect should be arrested if there is proba-
ble cause to make an arrest, the victim's unwillingness to cooperate is some-
thing that is beyond the control of law enforcement. On the other hand, the
case should not be cleared by exceptional means if the district attorney decli-
nes to file charges because the evidence in the cases does not meet the filing
standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. If there is probable cause to
arrest the suspect and the victim is cooperative, the suspect should be
arrested and the case cleared by arrest, as there is nothing beyond the control
of law enforcement that prevents them from making an arrest. Alternatively,
the detective could continue the investigation and, once additional evidence is
obtained, resubmit the case to the district attorney.
Research Design and Methods
This study entailed the collection of quantitative data on sex crimes reported
to the Los Angeles Police Department and the LASD. From each agency, we
obtained the complete case files for sexual assaults involving female victims
over the age of 12 that were reported in 2008; the LAPD and the LASD
redacted all information that could be used to identify the victims, suspects,
witnesses, or law enforcement officials assigned to investigate the case and
then provided us with a copy of the redacted file. From the LASD we obtained
case files for all reports that met our selection criteria (N = 543). Due to the
large number of cases reported to the LAPD in 2008, we selected a stratified
random sample of cases (N = 401). Because we wanted to ensure an adequate
number of cases from each of the LAPD's 19 divisions,3 as well as an adequate
number of cases from each case clearance category (i.e. cleared by arrest,
3. The LAPD currently has 21 divisions in 4 bureaus, but in 2008 there were only 19.

cleared by exceptional means, investigation continuing, and unfounded), the
sample was stratified by LAPD division and, within each division, by the type of
case clearance.4 For this study, we include only cases in which the most seri-
ous charge was rape or attempted rape (N = 650); cases in which sexual bat-
tery (i.e. sexual contact) was the most serious charge were deleted.
Because we were provided with the complete case file for each of the 2008
cases, we were able to extract very detailed quantitative and qualitative infor-
mation on each case. The case file included the crime report prepared by the
patrol officer who responded to the crime and took the initial report from the
victim, all follow-up reports prepared by the detective to whom the case was
assigned for investigation, and the detective's reasons for unfounding the
report or for clearing the case by arrest or by exceptional means. The case
files also included either verbatim accounts or summaries of statements made
by the victim, witnesses (if any), and the suspect (if the suspect was inter-
viewed); a description of physical evidence recovered from the alleged crime
scene; and the results of the forensic medical sexual assault exam of the vic-
tim (if she reported the crime within 72 hours of the alleged assault). Members
of the research team read through each case file and recorded data in an SPSS
data file. Coding protocols were developed by the researchers, who reviewed
and double-coded a sample of the files to ensure that there was consistency
and intercoder reliability (Alpha = .91)
Data for the Study
Because our focus is on arrest and charging decisions, and because arrest (and
charging) is not possible unless there is an identified suspect, for this project
we selected all rape and attempted rape cases in which the police knew the
identify and location of the suspect. Of the 650 cases in the original sample,
530 (81.5 percent) were cases with an identified suspect. Because there were
very few victims who were not white, Black, or Hispanic, we also eliminated
cases (N = 31) involving victims who were Asian American or other races. This
resulted in a data file with 491 cases; 171 were cases reported to the LAPD
and 320 were cases reported to the LASD.
4. Our goal was to select 6 cases from each case closure type from each of the 19 divisions that
existed in 2008. This would have produced a sample of 456 cases. Because each division did not
necessarily have 6 cases from each case closure type in 2008, the final sample included 401 cases.
We created a weighted sample that divided the percentage of each stratum (that is, each case clo-
sure type for each division) in the population of cases by the percentage of each stratum in the
sample (see footnote 1). We use the unweighted data when we are focusing on a particular type of
case closure (e.g. unfounded cases or cases that were cleared by exceptional means). We use the
weighted data when discussing 2008 case outcomes and when providing descriptive statistics for
these cases.

Dependent and Independent Variables
Our dependent variables are measures of decisions made by police and prose-
cutors in sexual assault cases. Beginning with the decision to arrest, we con-
ceptualize this decision in two ways. The first is a dichotomous measure of
whether the case was cleared by arrest and the second is a dichotomous indi-
cator of whether the suspect was arrested. As explained above, both the LAPD
and, to a lesser extent, the LASD change the case clearance category from
cleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional means in cases in which they make
an arrest but the district attorney does not file felony charges. Focusing only
on cases that were cleared by arrest, in other words, means that not all cases
that resulted in the arrest of a suspect are "counted" as arrests. Our third
dependent variable is a dichotomous indicator of whether the investigating
detective presented the case to an ADA for pre-arrest charge evaluation. This
variable is coded 1 if the case was presented to the district attorney prior to
the arrest of the suspect; it is coded 0 if the case was presented following the
arrest of the suspect. We also conceptualize the charging decision in two
ways.5 The first, which is the conceptualization used by prior research, exami-
nes charging outcomes only for cases that resulted in the arrest of a suspect
(N = 210); the second, which we argue more accurately captures the decisions
that prosecutors make, examines charging decisions in all cases that were pre-
sented to the district attorney for a charge evaluation, regardless of whether
the suspect was arrested or not (N = 357). For both variables, cases in which
charges were filed are coded 1 and cases in which charges were rejected are
coded 0. We use binary logistic regression analysis to analyze each of our
dichotomous dependent variables.
Our independent variables are drawn from Black's sociological theory of law
and from the focal concerns perspective (as applied to police and prosecutor
decision-making). They include victim characteristics, indicators of crime seri-
ousness, and measures of the strength of evidence in the case. The victim
characteristics include the victim's age, race/ethnicity, relationship with the
suspect, whether the victim engaged in what might be perceived as risky
behavior at the time of the incident, and whether the case file indicated that
the victim had characteristics that would make police and prosecutors question
her credibility. The victim's age is a continuous variable that ranges from 12
to 60 (mean = 26.03). The victim's race/ethnicity is coded as white, black, or
Hispanic (whites are the reference category) and the relationship between the
victim and the suspect is coded as intimate partners, nonstrangers, or stran-
gers (strangers are the reference category). The risk-taking variable, which
reflects legally irrelevant stereotypes about real rapes and genuine victims, is
coded 1 if the case file indicated that at the time of the incident the victim

either was walking alone late at night, accepted a ride from a stranger, volun-
tarily went to the suspect's house, invited the suspect to her residence, was in
a bar alone, was in an area where illegal drugs were sold, was drinking alcohol,
was drunk, was using illegal drugs, or had passed out after drinking alcohol
and/or using illegal drugs. We use this composite variable, rather than the
individual variables, because of the small number of victims who were engaged
in any of these types of behavior at the time of the incident. Of the cases in
which the most serious charge was rape or attempted rape, 35.1 percent
(N = 125) involved some type of risky behavior, typically walking alone late at
night or drinking alcohol.
The character/reputation variable is also a composite of several factors that
might lead officials to question the victim's credibility. This variable was
coded 1 if there was information in the case file indicating that the victim had
a pattern of alcohol or drug abuse, had a disreputable job (e.g. stripper, exo-
tic dancer), or was a prostitute, or had a criminal record. There were 49 cases
(13.8 percent) with one or more of these character issues.6 The final two vic-
tim characteristics measure whether there was information in the case file to
indicate that the victim had a mental illness or mental health issues (yes = 1;
no = 0)7 or to indicate that the victim had a motive to lie about being sexually
assaulted (yes = 1; no = 0).8
Consistent with the focal concerns perspective, our model also includes a
number of indicators of the seriousness of the sexual assault and the danger-
ousness of the suspect, including whether the most serious charge was rape
(which includes oral copulation, sodomy, and penetration with an object in
addition to penile-vaginal penetration) rather than attempted rape, whether
the suspect used a weapon during the assault (yes = 1; no = 0), and whether
the suspect physically as well as sexually assaulted the victim (yes = 1; no = 0).
In addition, our indicators of case seriousness include a variable that measures
whether the victim suffered some type of collateral injury (e.g. bruises, cuts,
6. This variable was coded 1 if the case file indicated that the victim was currently or had been in
the past a patient at a mental health facility, that the victim was taking medication for a mental
health problem, or if a family member or friend told the responding officer or the detective that
the victim had a mental illness or mental health issues.
7. Information about whether the victim had a motive to lie was obtained either from the victim's
statement, the interview of the victim by the IO, or the statement of witnesses. Examples of the
types of statements found in the case file regarding the victim's motive to lie are the following:
"all informants interviewed said the victim fabricated the incident because her parents found out
she was sexually active," "victim was angry with suspect because he would not give her crack
cocaine," "the victim was angry that the suspect returned to his wife," "the victim is involved in a
custody dispute with the suspect," "victim was angry with suspect because he broke off the affair
with her," "victim did not want her mother to find out what she did," "victim was cheating on her
husband with the suspect," "suspect (victim's boyfriend) was flirting with another woman at a
party," "suspect has nude photos of victim and victim found out that suspect has another girl-
friend," "the girls were afraid that they would get in trouble for coming home late."
8. This information was obtained from the report of the sexual assault examination, from the
responding officer's description of the victim's physical condition, and/or from the victim's and/or
witnesses' statements in the case file.

choke marks) during the assault (yes = 1; no = 0) (see footnote 8). Finally, we
measure whether the victim verbally or physically resisted the suspect using a
set of dummy variables that includes no verbal or physical resistance, verbal
resistance only, physical resistance only, and both verbal and physical resis-
tance (no verbal or physical resistance is the reference category).9
Because of the importance of evidentiary factors in arrest and charging
decisions, we control for several variables that measure the strength of evi-
dence in the case. The first is whether the victim made a prompt report
(yes = 1; no = 0), which we define as a report within one hour of the incident.10
Other evidentiary factors include the number of witnesses to the alleged
assault and whether the victim was willing to cooperate as the case moved for-
ward (yes = 1; no = 0).11 Our final evidentiary factor is a composite measure
that is coded 1 if any of the following types of evidence were collected from
the victim or from the scene of the incident: fingerprints, blood, hair, skin
samples, clothing, bedding, or semen. To capture differences between the two
law enforcement agencies, we include a variable measuring whether the case
was reported to the LAPD (coded 1) or the LASD (coded 0).
Findings
Case Outcomes
The outcomes of the sexual assault cases reported to the LAPD and the LASD
are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The data presented in Table 1 indicate that, for
both agencies combined, the percentage of rape and attempted rape cases
with an identified suspect in which a suspect was arrested was 46.8 percent;
9. The type of resistance was obtained from the victim's statement. We originally coded six types
of verbal resistance (cried, screamed, refused/protested/said stop, attempt to dissuade/fool, calls
names/denigrates suspect, passive/saying nothing) and five types of physical resistance (fled/at-
tempted to flee, resisted/struggled, fought (hit, scratched, bit), used a weapon to defend, pas-
sive/did nothing to resist). Because there could be multiple types of resistance, we coded verbal
resistance 1 if the case file indicated that there was any type of verbal resistance; similarly, we
coded physical resistance 1 if the file indicated that there was any type of physical resistance.
10. One fourth of the victims in these cases reported the incident within one hour. We opera-
tionalized a prompt report in this way based on our interviews with detectives, who emphasized
that the failure to report the crime within an hour or two made it more likely that the victim
would shower or launder clothing or bedding, which would reduce the likelihood of collecting phys-
ical evidence from the victim or the crime scene.
11. Whether the victim was willing to cooperate with the detective assigned to the case was deter-
mined from the case file. If the victim was uncooperative, it would be noted in the file by the IO.
For example, the IO might have noted that he/she had attempted to contact the victim but the
victim refused to talk to him/her (either via telephone or in person), that the victim stated that
she did not want anything to happen to the suspect/that she did not want the suspect arrested,
that the victim said (for a variety of reasons) that she did not want to take the case to court, that
the victim stated that she was no longer interested in pursuing a criminal prosecution, or that the
victim refused to participate in a pre-filing interview with the district attorney's office.

the arrest rate was 40.4 percent for the LAPD and 50.3 percent for the LASD.
Of the cases that resulted in an arrest, only 71.3 percent were cleared by
arrest; the remaining cases (28.7 percent) were cleared by exceptional means
when the district attorney refused to file felony charges. The rate at which
arrested cases were formally cleared by arrest was higher for the LASD (75.2
percent) than for the LAPD (62.3 percent). Considering both law enforcement
agencies, there were 357 cases in which the district attorney made a charging
decision. As shown in Table 2, 147 cases (41.2 percent) were presented to an
ADA before the suspect was arrested and 210 cases (58.8 percent) were pre-
sented after the suspect was arrested. Of the cases presented before arrest,
the ADA filed charges in only 9 (6.1 percent) cases. By contrast, charges were
filed in 106 (50.5 percent) of the cases presented to the ADA following the
arrest of the suspect. The discrepancy in outcomes for cases reviewed by the
prosecutor before and after the arrest of the suspect--and especially the fact
that cases reviewed prior to the suspect's arrest rarely resulted in the filing of
charges--suggests that detectives present weak or problematic cases to the

ADA prior to making an arrest, perhaps with an expectation that charges will
be rejected and the case can be closed. Coupled with the fact that more than
a fourth of the rape and attempted rape cases in which the police made an
arrest were not cleared by arrest but by exceptional means, this suggests that
the decision to arrest is not adequately measured by examining only cases that
were cleared by arrest and that the charging decision is not effectively mea-
sured by examining only cases that were evaluated following the arrest of the
suspect.
Predictors of Police Decision Making
The results of our analysis of the two arrest variables (suspect arrested and
case cleared by arrest) and of the detective's decision to present the case to
the district attorney for charge evaluation prior to the arrest of the suspect
are presented in Table 3. The decision to arrest the suspect was not affected
by any of the victim characteristics; instead, this decision was affected by all
of the indictors of crime seriousness except the type of resistance offered by
the victim and by all four measures of the strength of evidence in the case.
Consistent with our theoretical expectations, arrest was more likely if the
crime was more serious, as measured by whether the suspect physically, as
well as sexually, assaulted the victim, whether the suspect used a weapon,
and whether the victim suffered some type of collateral injury; by contrast,
arrest was less likely if the crime involved rape rather than attempted rape.
The police were more likely to arrest the suspect if the victim reported the
crime within one hour, the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation,
and there was physical evidence from the victim or the crime scene; the likeli-
hood of arrest also increased as the number of witnesses increased.
In contrast to these results, which suggest that arrest decisions are based on
legally relevant factors, the results of the analysis of cases that were officially
cleared by arrest indicate that this outcome was affected by a combination of
indicators of crime seriousness and evidentiary strength and victim characteris-
tics. The case was less likely to be cleared by arrest if the case file contained
information that raised questions about the victim's reputation or character,
the victim had a motive to lie, or the case involved rape rather than
attempted rape. Consistent with the results for the arrest decision, the case
was more likely to be cleared by arrest if the suspect used a weapon, the vic-
tim suffered collateral injuries, the victim reported the crime within one hour,
and the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation of the crime. Nei-
ther outcome, on the other hand, was affected by the victim's age, race/eth-
nicity, or relationship with the suspect; by whether the victim engaged in
behavior that could be perceived as risky at the time of the incident or had a
mental illness or mental health issues, or by the type of resistance offered by
the victim.

We also analyzed whether the detective investigating the crime presented
the case/case file to the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation.
The frequency with which sexual assault cases are presented to the district
attorney for charge evaluation prior to the suspect's arrest, coupled with the
fact that the outcomes of cases evaluated prior to and following the arrest of
the suspect differ significantly, suggests that it is important to identify the fac-
tors that predict whether cases will be presented to the ADA and evaluated
before or after arrest. As shown in the third column of Table 3, only one vic-
tim characteristic--whether the victim engaged in any risky behavior at the
time of the alleged assault--influenced whether the case would be presented
to the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation. Cases involving vic-
tims who engaged in what could be perceived as risky behavior were 1.9 times
more likely to be presented to the district attorney prior to the arrest of the
suspect. Surprisingly, given the comments of detectives, many of whom stated
that cases involving non-strangers were much more likely to be subjected to
pre-arrest charge evaluation, the relationship between the suspect and the vic-
tim did not affect the likelihood that the case would be presented to the dis-
trict attorney prior to the arrest of the suspect.
The odds of a pre-arrest charge evaluation also were affected by two indica-
tors of crime seriousness and all four measures of evidentiary strength. Com-
pared to cases in which the most serious charge was attempted rape, cases in
which rape was the most serious charge were over six times more likely to be
presented to the district attorney before the suspect could be arrested. The
likelihood of a pre-arrest charge evaluation was significantly lower for cases in
which the suspect used some type of weapon, the victim reported the crime
within one hour, the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation, there
was some type of physical evidence, and there were one or more witnesses.

SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 19
These results, then, suggest that detectives bring cases in which the evidence
is weaker or there are questions about the victim's behavior at the time of the
incident to district attorneys for a pre-arrest charge evaluation.
Predictors of Prosecutors' Charging Decisions
As noted above, the outcomes of cases presented to the district attorney for a
charging decision before and after the arrest of the suspect were very differ-
ent: only 9 of the 147 cases evaluated before the suspect was arrested were
accepted for prosecution; by contrast, 106 of the 210 cases evaluated after
the suspect was arrested were accepted for prosecution. We therefore analyze
two indicators of charging--whether the district attorney accepted the case
for prosecution following the arrest of the suspect and whether the district
attorney accepted the case for prosecution either before or after the arrest of
the suspect--and we argue that the latter is a more accurate and valid mea-
sure of prosecutors' charging decisions.
The results of our analysis of these variables, which are shown in Table 4,
reveal that different factors affect the two outcomes. Beginning with the more
traditional conceptualization of charging--charging decisions that follow the
arrest of the suspect--only three variables affect this outcome: the victim's
age (charging is four and a half times more likely if the victim is under the age
of 18); whether the victim had a motive to lie; and whether the victim was
willing to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the case. In fact,
prosecutors were nearly 19 times more likely to file charges if the victim was
cooperative and they were about 6 times more likely to accept the case for
prosecution if the victim did not have a motive to lie. Although our broader
indicator of charging, which includes charging decisions made before or after
the arrest of the suspect, is affected in the same way by these three variables,
it also is affected by victim behavior that can be perceived as risky, whether
the most serious charge was rape rather than attempted rape, whether the
suspect used a weapon, and whether the victim reported the crime within one
hour. Consistent with the results of the arrest decisions, charging was not
affected by the victim's race/ethnicity or relationship with the suspect,
whether the victim had a mental illness or mental health issues, or the type of
resistance offered by the victim.
Discussion
The results of our analysis reveal that arresting and charging decisions in sex-
ual assault cases are affected by legally relevant indicators of case seriousness
and evidentiary strength and, depending upon the way in which the outcome is
operationally defined, by legally irrelevant indicators of the victim's behavior
at the time of the incident and her character, reputation, and motivation in
20 SPOHN AND TELLIS
reporting the crime to the police. These findings are consistent with the focal
concerns perspective and, to a lesser extent, with Black's sociological theory
of law. They suggest that the decisions of police and prosecutors, like those of
judges, are affected by their perceptions of crime seriousness and offender

dangerousness and by their assessments of the likelihood of conviction, which
are themselves influenced not only by the strength of evidence in the case but
by stereotypes (Johnson & Betsinger, 2009) or typifications (Frohmann, 1991,
1997) of rape and rape victims. Our results thus provide further evidence of
the utility of the focal concerns perspective and of its applicability to decisions
other than sentencing.
Our findings are not consistent with Black's (1989, p. 21) assertions that the
"handling of a case always reflects the social characteristics of those involved
in it." The race/ethnicity of the victim did not affect any of the case out-
comes and the age of the victim affected charging, but not arrest, decisions.
In contrast to prior research (Frazier & Haney, 1996; Holleran et al., 2010; Tel-
lis & Spohn, 2008), which found that sexual assaults involving strangers were
treated more harshly than those involving acquaintances or intimate partners,
we also found that the victim/suspect relationship did not affect any of the
outcomes we examined. This is surprising, given Black's (1976) contention that
case outcomes are affected by the "relational distance" between the victim
and the suspect and given that all of the cases included in our study were
cases with an identified suspect. We expected that in cases with an identified
suspect, the police would be more likely to arrest and the prosecutor would be
more likely to file charges if the victim and the suspect were strangers. The
fact that the relationship between the victim and suspect did not affect case
outcomes once other victim characteristics, indicators of case seriousness, and
measures of evidentiary strength were taken into consideration suggests that it
is not the victim/suspect relationship per se that influences arresting and
charging decisions; rather, the characteristics of cases and the strength of the
evidence vary depending on the type of relationship.
The findings of our study also make a number of important methodological
contributions.
Prior research on police and prosecutorial decision-making has been criti-
cized for failure to control adequately for crime seriousness and strength of
evidence in the case, with critics arguing that models that lack these measures
are misspecified. Because we had access to the case files, we were able to col-
lect detailed data on physical evidence, witnesses, whether the victim was
willing to cooperate at various stages in the process, and whether the victim
reported the crime promptly. We also were able to collect several indicators
of crime seriousness--whether the suspect used a weapon or physically
assaulted the victim and whether the victim suffered some type of collateral
injury. The fact that we were able to control for these legally relevant factors
may explain why some of the factors identified by prior research did not affect
the arrest and charging decisions we examined.
We also demonstrate the importance of the ways in which arrest and charg-
ing decisions are conceptualized and operationalized. The concept of "cleared
by arrest" plays a key role in research on police and prosecutorial decision-
making. Policing researchers often operationalize the decision to arrest based
on whether the crime was cleared by the arrest of a suspect and researchers
22 SPOHN AND TELLIS
examining prosecutorial charging decisions typically examine data on cases
that resulted in an arrest and were presented by law enforcement for a formal
charging decision. These operational definitions are based on assumptions that
all cases that result in the arrest of a suspect are cases that are cleared by
arrest and that the only cases on which prosecutors make charging decisions
are cases in which a suspect was arrested. As we have shown, these assump-
tions are not necessarily valid. At least in this jurisdiction (Los Angeles) and
for this type of crime (sexual assault), a substantial proportion of cases in
which a suspect was arrested were not cleared by arrest; this occurred when
the district attorney reviewing the case following the arrest of the suspect
rejected the case for prosecution and the detective investigating the crime
changed the case clearance from cleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional
means. Moreover, a significant number of cases were evaluated--and rejected
for prosecution--by the district attorney prior to the arrest of the suspect.
Defining the decision to arrest as cases that were formally cleared by arrest
and operationalizing the charging decision as cases that were evaluated follow-
ing arrest is misleading, as doing so undercounts both types of decisions.
Further evidence of this surfaced in our multivariate analyses of arresting
and charging decisions. We found that the predictors of these outcomes varied
depending on the way in which the outcome was defined. For example, none
of the victim characteristics affected whether the suspect was arrested by the
police, but whether there were questions about the victim's character or repu-
tation and whether the victim had a motive to lie about the incident predicted
the likelihood that the crime would be cleared by arrest. These differences
reflect the fact that many of the cases that resulted in the arrest of the sus-
pect, but did not result in the filing of charges by the prosecutor, are not
defined as cases that are cleared by arrest (due to the fact that the detective
changed the case clearance from cleared by arrest to cleared by exceptional
means). The cleared by arrest variable, in other words, conflates decisions
made by police and prosecutors. The fact that these victim characteristics
affected whether the case was cleared by arrest but not whether the police
made an arrest suggests that the police are willing to make arrests in poten-
tially problematic cases but that prosecutors are not willing to file charges in
these cases. Alternatively, it may be that questions about the victim's charac-
ter, reputation, or motivation for filing the complaint do not surface--or do
not raise red flags if they do--until the victim is interviewed by the district
attorney.
We also found that different variables affected our two indicators of charg-
ing. When we used the traditional operational definition--the suspect was
arrested and the district attorney evaluated the case for prosecution--we
found that only three variables (the victim's age, whether the victim was will-
ing to cooperate, and whether the victim had a motive to lie) affected the
likelihood of charging. Our analysis of the charging variable that combined
cases screened before and after the arrest of the suspect revealed that four
additional variables--whether the victim engaged in risky behavior, whether
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 23
the most serious charge was rape, whether the suspect used a weapon, and
whether the victim reported the crime within one hour--had an effect. These
results suggest that detectives present problematic cases in which there is an
identified suspect and in which there may be probable cause to make an arrest
to the district attorney for a charge evaluation before arresting the suspect
and that these cases are rejected for prosecution. That this is, in fact, what is
occurring was confirmed by our analysis of the detective's decision to present
the case to the district attorney for a pre-arrest charge evaluation. Detectives
were significantly more likely to bring the case to the district attorney before
arresting the suspect if the victim engaged in risky behavior, did not report
the crime promptly, and was unwilling to cooperate as the case moved for-
ward; if the suspect did not use a weapon; if there was no physical evidence,
and if there were no or few witnesses. In fact, we found that the various mea-
sures of the strength of evidence in the case had a positive effect on whether
the suspect would be arrested and whether the case would be cleared by
arrest, but a negative effect on whether the case would be presented to the
district attorney for charge evaluation prior to the arrest of the suspect. Cou-
pled with the fact that all but 9 of the 147 cases evaluated by the district
attorney prior to the arrest of the suspect were rejected for prosecution, this
suggests that pre-arrest charge evaluation is an important component of both
police and prosecutorial decision-making.
The detectives and district attorneys we interviewed acknowledged that
pre-arrest charge evaluation either was unique to sexual assault or occurred
with much greater frequency in sexual assault cases than in other types of
cases. They attributed this to the fact that many sexual assaults involve vic-
tims and suspects who are acquainted in some way and that a good portion of
these involve a consent defense, delayed reporting, and/or alcohol or drug use
by the victim. Although a number of respondents--especially district attorneys
--justified pre-arrest charge evaluation as a means of ensuring that the evi-
dence in the case was solid before the suspect was arrested, many detectives
acknowledged that they presented cases to the district attorney before arrest-
ing the suspect with the expectation that the case would be rejected for pros-
ecution. This suggests that pre-arrest charge evaluation is being used, not to
ensure that "all of the i's are dotted and the t's crossed," but to dispose of
weak or problematic cases. This is confirmed by the fact that all but three of
the 138 cases rejected for prosecution prior to the arrest of the suspect were
cleared by exceptional means. Rather than arresting the suspect, detectives
present cases that they believe will be rejected for prosecution to the district
attorney and, when that happens, they clear, or solve, these cases exception-
ally.
One other finding merits comment. We found that only one variable--
whether the victim was willing to cooperate in the investigation and prosecu-
tion of the case--affected all five of the outcomes we examined. In fact, vic-
tim cooperation had a substantial effect on each outcome. The police were six
times more likely to arrest the suspect and were nearly 10 times more likely
24 SPOHN AND TELLIS
to clear the case by arrest if the victim was cooperative; they were signifi-
cantly less likely to present the case to the district attorney for a pre-arrest
charge evaluation if the victim was willing to cooperate. The effect of victim
cooperation on charging decisions was even more pronounced; cases with a
cooperative victim were almost 15 times more likely to result in the filing of
charges before or after the suspect's arrest and were almost 19 times more
likely to result in the filing of charges following the arrest of the suspect.
These findings, although not surprising, point to the importance of the individ-
ual-level dynamic between victims and detectives and between victims and
prosecutors. They also suggest that a fruitful avenue for future research would
be to determine why victims withdraw their cooperation after making a sexual
assault report.
Our results have important policy implications. We found that law enforce-
ment officials in Los Angeles overuse (in fact, misuse) the exceptional clear-
ance in two important situations: when an arrest does not lead to the filing of
felony charges and when cases are rejected for prosecution during the pre-ar-
rest charge evaluation. Regarding the first situation, cases that result in the
arrest of a suspect should be cleared by arrest, as these cases do not meet the
fourth requirement for clearing cases by exceptional means. Given that the
suspect was arrested, there is by definition nothing beyond the control of law
enforcement that prevents an arrest. Thus, cases in which a suspect is arrested
should be cleared by arrest. The second situation in which cases may be
cleared incorrectly by exceptional means is where probable cause to arrest the
suspect exists but the detective chooses instead to present the case to the dis-
trict attorney's office, where charges are rejected based on insufficient evi-
dence. Like the first scenario, this situation is problematic in that it does not
involve something beyond the control of the law enforcement that prevents
the arrest of the suspect. There is probable cause to make an arrest but the
case is cleared exceptionally because a prosecutor determined that the evi-
dence is insufficient to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.
Whether a suspect is arrested should not be contingent on whether the pros-
ecuting attorney believes that the evidence meets the standard of proof
beyond a reasonable doubt and that the case therefore would result in a jury
conviction. Doing so subjects the decision to arrest to a higher standard of
proof than is required by law and effectively gives the prosecutor control over
the decision to arrest. It also means that individuals who may have committed
a serious crime are not held accountable for their behavior and denies justice
to victims who made a difficult decision to report the crime and are willing to
cooperate with the police and prosecutor as the case moves forward. Failure
to make an arrest in spite of probable cause to do so is reminiscent of police
inaction in response to domestic violence prior to the implementation of
mandatory arrest policies. Although we are not suggesting that police depart-
ments should adopt mandatory arrest policies for sexual assault cases, they
should make an arrest when there is sufficient evidence that a crime occurred
and that the suspect is the person who committed the crime.
SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE OUTCOMES 25
Clearly, there are cases where the police cannot--indeed should not--make
an arrest. If probable cause to arrest does not exist or if the prosecutor rejects
the case for further investigation as a result of a pre-arrest screening process,
the case should be left open and investigated further. These cases should not
be cleared by exceptional means, as they do not meet the UCR criterion that
there must be "enough information to support an arrest, charge, and turning
over to the court for prosecution." The case cannot be solved--that is,
cleared--if probable cause to make an arrest does not exist. Cases in which
the police know who and where the suspect is and in which probable cause
exists to make an arrest, but the victim refuses to cooperate with the police
can legitimately be cleared by exceptional means if the victim's lack of coop-
eration means that the police cannot make an arrest.
We believe that our study, which was conducted in one of the largest and
most diverse cities in the United States, makes important theoretical and
methodological contributions to our understanding of police and prosecutorial
decision-making. However, our approach is not without limitations, the most
important of which stems from our reliance on the information contained in
official case files. Although we were provided with redacted copies of all docu-
ments in the case files, the material contained in the files ultimately reflects
the perceptions and biases of individual law enforcement officers, who
describe the incident, recount the victim's allegations, and document the
results of interviews with victims, witnesses, and suspects. Although we have
no reason to believe that their accounts were slanted or written in such a way
as to make the department "look good," there is obviously a possibility of "bi-
ased reporting," which we cannot measure or take into consideration.
Conclusion
Like prior researchers, we began our project on police and prosecutorial deci-
sion-making in sexual assault cases with an assumption that law enforcement's
decision to arrest and the district attorney's decision to file charges were sep-
arate decisions that reflected different standards of proof and different deci-
sion rules. We recognized that prosecutors' filing decisions would be based in
part on the adequacy of the investigation conducted by law enforcement and
on the willingness of the victim to cooperate, which, in turn, would be
affected by the handling of the case by the IO. We also recognized that the
IO's decision to arrest or not might reflect to some extent his/her beliefs
about the likelihood of successful prosecution. However, we did not expect to
find that the decision to arrest the suspect or not would in many cases be de-
termined by the prosecutor's evaluation of the case or that a substantial pro-
portion of cases would be rejected for prosecution prior to the arrest of the
suspect.
The findings of our study illuminate the ways in which the decisions of police
and prosecutors overlap and influence one another. Our findings also illustrate
26 SPOHN AND TELLIS
that, at least in the context of sexual assault, it is misleading to assume that
data on cases cleared by arrest accurately reflect police arrest decisions and
that data on cases that were evaluated for charging following the arrest of the
suspect accurately capture prosecutors' charging decisions. More importantly,
our findings illustrate that the conclusions we draw about the factors that
influence sexual assault case outcomes depend to some extent on the concep-
tualization and operationalization of decisions to arrest and charge. Our
research has attempted to disentangle these complicated relationships in one
jurisdiction and with respect to one type of crime. Future research should
focus on determining whether these overlapping decision rules are found in
other jurisdictions and for other types of crimes.
It is also important to point out that the findings of our study confirm what
research conducted 30 or 40 years ago revealed about the response of the
criminal justice system to the crime of sexual assault. Although legally rele-
vant indicators of crime seriousness and evidentiary strength predicted
whether the suspect would be arrested and charged, legally irrelevant victim
characteristics also played a role. The rape reform movement and more recent
attention to the problematic nature of attrition in sexual assault cases
notwithstanding, police and prosecutors continue to make decisions based at
least in part on their assessments of the victim's character, reputation, behav-
ior at the time of the incident, and motivation for reporting. This suggests that
stereotypes about real rapes and genuine victims have endured and that they
continue to negatively affect the likelihood of arrest and successful prosecu-
tion of those who commit this violent crime.
