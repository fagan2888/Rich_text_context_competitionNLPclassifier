Introduction
In recent years, expectations have risen for effective risk over-
sight, especially during the recent financial crisis, and most of
those expectations have been placed explicitly on the shoul-
ders of boards of directors. Stock exchanges, regulators, legis-
lators, credit rating agencies, and industry associations have
implemented changes designed to strengthen enterprise-wide
risk oversight with an emphasis on enhancing the board's role
in risk governance (Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, 2010; National
Association of Insurance Commissioners, 2013; New York
Stock Exchange [NYSE], 2004; Securities and Exchange
Commission [SEC], 2009; Standard & Poor's [S&P], 2012).
Most of these place the onus of responsibility for owning risk
governance on the board.
In terms of risk governance, there are two overarching
responsibilities being placed on boards of directors:
1. The board of directors should understand and approve
management's process for overseeing enterprise risks
(i.e., the board assesses the enterprise risk manage-
ment [ERM] process).
2. The board of directors should evaluate the risks iden-
tified by management's process for overseeing enter-
prise risks to govern the actions taken by management
to create value (i.e., the board uses information from
the ERM process).
Pressure to fulfill these responsibilities is causing many
boards to place expectations on management to design and
implement robust processes for identifying, assessing, man-
aging, and monitoring the most significant enterprise-wide
risks. In fact, almost 70% of over 1,000 executives surveyed
indicate that many board members are asking for greater risk
oversight involvement by senior management. That percent-
age grows to 88% for public companies (Beasley, Branson,
& Hancock, 2015).
Often the board works through its audit committee to over-
see management's risk management processes, and that results
in the audit committee turning to executives in key accounting
and financial reporting roles, such as the chief financial officer
(CFO) or chief audit executive, for initial risk management
leadership. Accordingly, the accounting profession has been
actively involved in developing ERM methods. Specifically,

Research Insights About Risk Governance:
Implications From a Review of ERM
Research
Therese R. Viscelli1, Mark S. Beasley2, and Dana R. Hermanson3
Abstract
In recent years, expectations for increased risk governance have been placed explicitly on boards of directors. In response,
boards are being held responsible for not only understanding and approving management's risk management processes, but
they are also being held responsible for assessing the risks identified by those processes as part of overseeing management's
pursuit of value. These increasing responsibilities have led a number of organizations to adopt enterprise risk management
(ERM) as a holistic approach to risk management that extends beyond traditional silo-based risk management techniques.
As boards, often through their audit committee, consider management's implementation of ERM as part of the board's risk
oversight, a number of questions emerge that can be informed by academic research related to ERM. This article summarizes
findings from ERM research to provide insights related to the board's risk governance responsibilities. We also identify a
number of research questions that warrant further analysis by governance scholars. It is our hope that this article will spawn
varying types of research about ERM and corporate governance.

2 SAGE Open
Commission (COSO; 2004) issued Enterprise Risk
Management--Integrated Framework to provide directors
and managers with a model of the ERM process.
In response to these emerging expectations, a number of
organizations have adopted ERM to enhance the organiza-
tion's enterprise-wide risk oversight. ERM is a way to coor-
dinate all the risk management activities so that management
and the board have a top-down, enterprise-wide view of the
most important risks to the enterprise (COSO, 2004).
One of the challenges for the board of directors in fulfilling
its risk governance responsibilities is determining whether or
not management's ERM practices are designed and operating
effectively. In most situations, the board of directors is heavily,
if not solely, dependent on management's description and self-
assessment of the effectiveness of their risk management pro-
cesses. Boards may be unsure as to whether the ERM processes
implemented by management are appropriate and consistent
with emerging best practices, and they may question whether
those processes generate risk information that the board and
management can use to design and implement strategies to pro-
tect and enhance stakeholder value. In summary, boards are in
need of information to help them fulfill their risk governance
oversight responsibilities.
To respond to this need, we examine the emerging body of
ERM-related research to provide insights relevant to board of
director risk governance responsibilities. While the overall vol-
ume and extent of ERM research is relatively small, we review
the emerging academic literature on ERM by performing sev-
eral searches for articles that provide insights related to ques-
tions boards may have in regard to enterprise risk governance.
Specifically, we summarize findings from ERM research that
provides insights to the following questions related to the
board's two primary risk governance responsibilities:
1. Research insights to inform the board as it assumes
responsibility for understanding and approving man-
agement's risk management processes that address
these questions:
a. What types of organizations adopt ERM as a
risk management paradigm?
b. What techniques comprise an ERM process?
c. What is the role of internal audit (IA) in ERM?
2. Research insights to inform the board as it assumes
responsibility for evaluating risk information gener-
ated by ERM processes as it governs management's
strategic actions to protect and enhance stakeholder
value that address these questions:
a. How are organizations integrating ERM pro-
cesses with strategy?
b. How does ERM affect firm value and perfor-
mance?
c. How does organizational culture affect the value
of ERM?
We believe the emerging stream of academic research
about ERM provides insights to boards as they assume
responsibilities for risk governance. To synthesize that
research for boards and other governance players, we sum-
marize key insights by organizing our review of the key find-
ings along the above questions. One of our goals is to
synthesize this research to inform boards as they assume
greater risk oversight responsibilities.
Because research on ERM is still emerging, we also
believe there is significant opportunity for future research to
provide additional analysis of a number of issues related to
enterprise-wide risk management. Building on a model simi-
lar to Bromiley, McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov (2015),
who reviewed ERM literature to promote research by man-
agement scholars, we review ERM research to develop a
number of ERM-related questions to be examined by gover-
nance scholars (including those in accounting, auditing, and
finance), which is a second goal of this study.
The remainder of the article is organized as follows.
The next section summarizes our methodology for identi-
fying ERM-related research, and the following section
summarizes key findings from articles that provide insights
to inform the board as it assumes responsibility for under-
standing and approving management's risk management
processes. We also include calls for additional research to
provide additional insights related to that responsibility.
The subsequent section summarizes key findings from
articles that provide insights to the board as it assumes
responsibility for evaluating risk information generated by
ERM processes as it governs management's strategic
actions to protect and enhance stakeholder value. That sec-
tion also includes identification of a number of additional
research topics relevant to the board. Finally, we provide
overall conclusions.
Methodology for Reviewing ERM
Academic Literature
We conducted several searches for articles to include in this
review, focusing mostly on topics related to ERM. Using the
electronic databases EBSCO, ProQuest, Science Direct, and
Google Scholar, we searched on "ERM," "risk," "enter-
prise," and "COSO." The search was limited primarily to
articles published after 1999, as ERM emerged mostly in the
2000s. While some articles from financial and insurance
journals are included in this review, overall, we have
excluded most highly technical, industry-specific research
that does not directly address ERM. The references in each
of the articles selected for review were examined to identify
additional articles that may not have been found in the search
of the electronic databases. The focus was on published aca-
demic journal articles, but selected working papers have
been included as well. Thus, we summarize the key findings
from ERM-related research papers to provide insights rele-
vant to the board's two overarching risk governance respon-
sibilities (see Figure 1).

Research Insights Related to Board's
Role in Assessing Management's ERM
Processes
As expectations for more effective board risk governance
have emerged, boards are being held accountable for under-
standing and approving management's processes for manag-
ing enterprise-wide risks. For example, the NYSE's
governance rules place explicit responsibilities on the audit
committee of the board to "discuss management's risk man-
agement and risk assessment processes," and the SEC's
proxy disclosure rules implemented in 2010 require public
companies to include disclosures about the board's role in
risk oversight in the annual proxy statement (NYSE, 2004;
SEC, 2009).
As boards assume greater responsibility for governance of
management's risk oversight processes, they face a number
of questions relevant to their obtaining an understanding of
and approving management's approach to enterprise-wide
risk oversight:
a. What types of organizations adopt ERM as a risk man-
agement paradigm?
b. What techniques comprise an ERM process?
c. What is the role of IA in ERM?
We use these questions as a framework for organizing our
understanding of insights from ERM-related research per-
formed to date, and we build upon that to generate a number
of research topics that governance scholars may consider for
future examination. See Table 1 for a summary of the
insights.
Organizational Characteristics of ERM Adopters
In light of limitations associated with traditional risk man-
agement, a number of organizations have begun to adopt
ERM. The goal of ERM is to manage risks at an enterprise
level to ensure that entity-wide risks to the organization have
been assessed, rather than just one aspect of risk to the orga-
nization. As boards of directors respond to the increasing
expectations for more effective board risk governance, many
are placing pressure on senior executives to implement ERM.
However, in making that decision, boards may question
whether the implementation of ERM in their organization
makes sense.
Colquitt, Hoyt, and Lee (1999) conducted one of the first
studies on risk management as it applied to risk financing
strategies, describing it as Integrated Risk Management. The
authors surveyed 379 firms and found that the role of risk
manager was growing in scope to integrate across the organi-
zation, beyond traditional financial risk management.
Industry and firm size also were associated with a more inte-
grated approach to risk management and affected the finan-
cial tools used to oversee risk.
Subsequent studies examine organizational factors and
financial characteristics of entities that adopt ERM to under-
stand factors that affect the embrace of ERM as a risk man-
agement paradigm. However, as firms do not usually
announce when they are embarking on an ERM implementa-
tion, it can be difficult for researchers to determine who has
implemented ERM. Some researchers have used announce-
ments of appointments of individuals to serve as chief risk
officer (CRO) or disclosures of ERM activities as proxies for
ERM adoption, while others have surveyed companies to
understand their stage of ERM adoption.
Using the announcement of a CRO as a signal of ERM
implementation, Liebenberg and Hoyt (2003) found that
firms announcing a CRO were among the largest in their
industry and were primarily in the financial and energy
industries. While they did not find significant differences in
firms' ownership (institutional vs. individual shareholders),
the study did show a relationship between higher leverage
and a greater likelihood to announce a CRO appointment.
Pagach and Warr (2011) also used the announcement of a
CRO as a signal of ERM adoption to provide additional anal-
ysis of firmwide factors that might explain an entity's ERM
implementation. The study found that firms with higher lev-
els of leverage and larger size (assets) were more likely to
announce the appointment of a CRO, consistent with
Liebenberg and Hoyt (2003). In addition, they found that
more volatile operating cash flows and greater stock volatil-
ity were positively associated with the announcement of a
CRO. Contrary to findings of Liebenberg and Hoyt, who did

not find a difference in ownership structure between ERM
adopters and the control group, Pagach and Warr found that
firms with a high percentage of shares owned by institutional
investors were more likely to have announced a CRO
appointment, consistent with institutions' desire for greater
risk control. In a subsample of firms where CEO compensa-
tion could be determined, Pagach and Warr found that firms
where CEO compensation was sensitive to stock volatility
were more likely to have a CRO.
In a study of U.S. insurers with ERM initiatives found
using a word search, Hoyt and Liebenberg (2011) found that
firms that have ERM initiatives were larger in size (assets)
and had more institutional ownership, consistent with Pagach
and Warr (2011). They did not find any significant associa-
tion between the extent of leverage, stock return volatility, or
opaqueness and the presence of ERM, as had been found in
some previous studies. In another study of U.S. insurers, Lin,
Wen, and Yu (2012) performed a similar word search and
found that firms that had implemented ERM had more rein-
surance and had greater geographic diversification compared
with firms that had not implemented ERM.
Lundqvist (2014a) examined the relationship between
ERM and credit risk management for a sample of banking
institutions. The author found that credit risk was reduced as
the level of ERM quality increased. No significant relation-
ship was found between ERM quality and credit rating when
controlling for governance characteristics such as board
independence, large ownership by a group, and corporate
governance measured by Thompson Reuters ASSET4 envi-
ronmental, social, and governance (ESG) content. The author
explains this last finding by suggesting that the market per-
haps values the risk management function itself, while the
credit rating agencies focus on risk governance aspects.
Other studies have used different proxies for ERM imple-
mentation. Beasley, Clune, and Hermanson (2005) explored
organizational factors and their relationship to the stage of
ERM implementation, based on surveys completed by internal
auditors. Like other studies that focus on the association of
firm characteristics and ERM implementation, they found
firm size (revenues) was positively related to the stage of
ERM. In addition, the study found firms that had a CRO, more
independent directors, or explicit ERM calls from the CEO

Board's role in assessing ERM Board evaluation of risk information
Characteristics of ERM adopters Strategy and ERM
Certain firmwide characteristics, such as size and industry,
and certain board and other governance characteristics
may be important factors that explain the decision by an
organization to adopt ERM; however, there are mixed
results related to other organizational factors and financial
characteristics of firms that may be associated with ERM
implementations.
While ERM is envisioned to provide an organization the opportunity
to manage risks to achieving its strategic objectives, the limited
academic research suggests that the integration of ERM and strategy
has not been fully achieved, and organizations are struggling to fully
leverage the strategic benefits of ERM.
ERM implementation ERM and firm value and performance
Only a few studies specifically address the use of ERM
frameworks, and they tend to focus on the COSO
framework. Organizations might rely to some extent
on those frameworks, but they are not likely to have
implemented significant aspects of them. Articles that
present specific case studies of firms adopting ERM show
that ERM implementation varies widely across firms, even
in the same industry. There is no one way to implement
ERM, and organizations have approached the launch of
ERM in a number of different ways. The limited access
to data about specific techniques and internal processes
used by organizations as they implement ERM has
limited the ability to conduct academic research about
the effectiveness of those processes. There is limited
knowledge about specific factors that may affect the
effectiveness of any number of ERM processes.
Better firm performance and increases in shareholder value are often
used as arguments to embrace ERM. There is some research that
contains evidence that ERM provides value, which is measured in
different ways across those studies. While there is a general theme
that ERM is associated with enhanced firm value, a number of those
studies are limited to the insurance industry.
Culture and ERM
Organizational culture has a significant impact on the decision to
implement ERM and on the effectiveness of that implementation.
Without sufficient support of ERM by the CEO or board of
directors, organizations may struggle in their efforts to find strategic
value in their ERM processes. Research about the role of culture in
the context of ERM is limited.
Internal audit and ERM
Internal auditors have facilitated a number of ERM
implementations, and there are concerns about
the potential compromising of IA's objectivity and
independence when IA assumes responsibility for ERM
implementation.
Note. ERM = enterprise risk management; COSO = Committee of Sponsoring Organization; IA = internal audit.
Viscelli et al. 5
and CFO were more likely to be at a more advanced stage of
ERM, suggesting that top management support for ERM is
critical for ERM implementation. Firms that engaged a Big
Four auditor were also found to be further along in ERM
implementation than were firms using smaller auditing firms.
Firms in the banking, education, and financial industries were
at a more advanced stage of ERM implementation than other
industries. Finally, the study found that U.S. firms were less
advanced in ERM implementation stage than international
firms.
Using a sample of 825 firms located in the Netherlands,
Paape and Spekle (2012) used the stage of ERM implemen-
tation (based on an ordinal scale of 1 to 5 with 4 to 5 being
adopters of ERM and 1 to 3 having traditional, silo
approaches to risk) to examine firm characteristics of those
with more advanced ERM. They found larger firms and
firms in financial industries were further along in ERM
stage, and stock ownership was not found to be significant,
which is consistent with findings in Liebenberg and Hoyt
(2003). Unlike some of the other studies focused on ERM
implementation, they did not find a relationship between
having a Big Four auditor and ERM development. The
authors also found that publicly traded firms, firms with a
CRO, and those with an audit committee were further along
in ERM implementation.
Baxter, Bedard, Hoitash, and Yezegel (2013) used S&P
ERM quality ratings for banking and insurance industry
firms to investigate variations in firm characteristics in rela-
tion to ERM ratings. Their results showed that companies
with higher ERM ratings were more complex, had greater
financial resources, and had better corporate governance.
They also found that higher risk firms had lower quality rat-
ings, which they attributed to resource constraints limiting
the investment in ERM.
Lundqvist (2015) surveyed 145 firms on two major
Nordic stock exchanges across multiple industries and found
that firms implementing ERM are larger, in line with Beasley
et al. (2005), Liebenberg and Hoyt (2003), and Pagach and
Warr (2011). As with Paape and Spekle (2012), having a Big
Four auditor did not affect risk governance, and firms in the
financial industry were marginally more advanced in ERM,
consistent with previous studies (Beasley et al., 2005;
Liebenberg & Hoyt, 2003). In addition, the quality of the
ERM governance and the following year's extent of leverage
were positively related, consistent with limiting the use of
free cash available to well-monitored managers. Finally,
unlike prior research, organizations with higher leverage
were less likely to have embraced ERM.
With the passage of Sarbanes­Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX),
external auditors and corporate boards were assigned spe-
cific responsibilities for risk assessments related to financial
statements. Farrell (2003) and Roth (2006) argued that firms
can leverage SOX Section 404's requirement that manage-
ment and auditors attest to the state of internal control over
financial reporting effectiveness to promote the evaluation of
risk at an enterprise level. Arnold, Benford, Canada, Kuhn,
and Sutton (2007) found in a study of four firms that all of
the firms believed their ERM was made more effective by
the effort to become SOX compliant, but it was an "unin-
tended" consequence of the 404 compliance effort.
Many companies have either board-level or management-
level committees that have responsibility for ERM imple-
mentation. Previous studies identified as a limitation the
ability to identify these firms. Subramaniam, McManus, and
Zhang (2009) used the presence of a Risk Management
Committee (RMC), as disclosed in a firm's annual report, to
signal ERM implementation in 200 of the top 300 Australian
Stock Exchange listed companies. Unlike some previous
studies, they did not find a significant relation between ERM
adoption and financial industry, board independence, or
leverage. The authors did find that an independent board
chair and larger boards were positively related to the pres-
ence of an RMC, as was organizational complexity as mea-
sured by the number of firm segments. Like Paape and
Spekle (2012), having a Big Four auditor was not related to
having an RMC.
Hines and Peters (2015) found that firms within the finan-
cial industry that formed an RMC had higher leverage (unlike
Subramaniam et al., 2009); had a larger, more independent
board; and were more likely to have a Big Four auditor. The
authors also found that lower financial quality, international
banking activity, and merger and acquisition activity where
related to having an RMC.
Key implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to
address our first question of interest (What types of organiza-
tions adopt ERM as a risk management paradigm?) reveals
that that certain firmwide characteristics, such as size and
industry, and certain governance characteristics may be
important factors that explain the decision by an organization
to adopt ERM. In particular, most studies find that larger
firms and firms in certain regulated industries, particularly
financial services and insurance, are associated with ERM
adoptions. We also observe in some studies that certain gov-
ernance factors, such as the level of board engagement, inde-
pendence, and the presence of institutional investors, are also
associated with ERM adoptions. Other factors, such as lever-
age, stock price or cash flow volatility, and the presence of a
Big Four auditor are sometimes associated with a firm's deci-
sion to implement ERM. We summarize these insights in
Table 1.
Opportunities for future research.The mixed results suggest
the need for additional studies of the relationship of organi-
zational factors and firm-level financial characteristics with
ERM initiatives. There are a number of research questions
related to firm- or industry-level characteristics that might
affect a firm's decision to implement ERM that warrant fur-
ther analysis. Column A of Appendix A includes a summary
of these research questions.

ERM Implementation Process
While boards of directors and senior executives may concep-
tually embrace ERM, they often face a number of questions
related to how organizations are implementing ERM to
ensure its effectiveness in risk oversight. Because ERM is a
relatively recent business paradigm, organizational leaders,
including the board, have been calling for insights to help
them understand specific processes that are needed when
implementing ERM. A number of practitioner articles have
been published with insights and suggestions related to pro-
cesses important when implementing ERM. Some articles
provide detailed steps, activities, and tools that should be
used, while others describe individual firms that have imple-
mented ERM, but not necessarily how they did it.
A number of ERM frameworks have been developed over
the last decade to assist organizations in their design and
implementation of ERM (COSO, 2004; International
Organization for Standardization [ISO], 2009). When a
board and its senior management team decide to implement
ERM, they may seek conceptual frameworks related to ERM
to guide the design of their ERM processes. In doing so, they
may question what frameworks exist and which framework(s)
are embraced by other organizations. Although only a few
studies specifically address the use of ERM frameworks, we
examine that research to summarize insights related to ERM
conceptual frameworks.
In light of the prominence of COSO as a thought leader in
ERM, Hayne and Free (2014) sought to understand the rise
of the COSO framework to its point of prominence in risk
management. The authors describe the processes and mecha-
nisms used by COSO to create the COSO ERM framework
and enable it to become so dominant. Through a series of
interviews with key stakeholders in risk management and
analysis of secondary documentation, the authors describe
the creation of "hybrid" professional groups and the impact
of these groups on the eventual adoption of the framework.
Tekathen and Dechow (2013) studied a German organiza-
tion while it implemented ERM by using semi-structured
interviews to understand how the organization implemented
ERM. Because the organization professed to having used the
COSO ERM framework, the authors compared the insights
from the interviews with the COSO ERM framework to
determine a fit to the framework. The authors stated that the
COSO framework was based on "radical assumptions," and
they asserted that the COSO framework implies that experts,
expertise, and eventualities are aligned within an organiza-
tion. The authors did not find this alignment in practice and
concluded that ERM is not effective in reducing uncertainty,
but instead increases the organization's interaction with
uncertainty, unless processes are designed to support the
alignment.
Paape and Spekle (2012) addressed the actual use of an
ERM framework, in particular the COSO ERM framework,
by 825 firms based in the Netherlands. The authors reported
that 43% of the firms indicated they used the COSO
framework, but the study only dichotomously captured the
use of the framework (i.e., framework used or not used) and
did not provide any detail as to how much or how the frame-
work was used.
Beyond studying the use of ERM frameworks, the ability
to conduct rigorous academic research about ERM imple-
mentation processes has been significantly limited by the lack
of publicly available data about specific internal tools and
techniques used as part of the risk oversight process. To
address this limitation, studies that have focused on specific
techniques used by firms when implementing ERM typically
have used a case study approach or surveys to examine inter-
nal activities that are associated with ERM implementations.
Articles that present specific case studies of firms adopt-
ing ERM show that ERM implementation varies widely
across firms, even in the same industry.1 Arena, Arnaboldi,
and Azzone (2010) studied three non-financial Italian firms
over a 7-year period. All three firms professed to have an
enterprise-wide risk management process, but each firm's
approach and resulting ERM process was influenced by the
firm's risk rationale. One firm's rationale for ERM was for
compliance, the second firm's rationale was for stronger cor-
porate governance to provide external assurance, and the
third firm's rationale was to improve performance that would
lead to enhanced company value. In another study, Arena,
Arnaboldi, and Azzone (2011), again studied non-financial
firms to understand the extent of ERM use and the relation-
ship of ERM use to the characteristics of the ERM tools
implemented. The authors found that firms that used ERM
for proactive actions, such as planning at the strategic level,
had ERM tools that were highly integrated through the orga-
nization at all levels and risk was centrally managed. The
study also found that the role played by the ERM coordinator
must include interaction with managers at all levels to help
those managers understand the value of ERM and to encour-
age open discussions across functional areas of the risks.
A working paper by Mikes and Kaplan (2014) used con-
tingency theory to identify design parameters that can explain
variation in how three different case study organizations
implemented ERM. Using interviews over the period of
2008-2012, they studied the implementation of ERM in
detail at the three organizations. They classify the implemen-
tation into three fundamental risk management components
and then classify the types of risks each firm encountered
into three categories.2 The authors found that organizations
approached risk management in different ways, and the
authors ultimately proposed that risk management is contin-
gent on the organization's nature and ability to control differ-
ent types of risks, which supports the view that risk
management is different for each firm.
In a single-organization study, Aabo, Fraser, and Simkins
(2005) studied ERM implementation at a Canadian electric
company. They chronicle the process beginning with the cre-
ation of a CRO position. The authors describe the actual pro-
cess including the techniques and tools that were used by the
firm. The successful implementation of ERM integrated risk
Viscelli et al. 7
into the workplace to the extent that the CRO position evolved
into a low-maintenance position within the company.
Two articles examine the use of risk maps in the imple-
mentation of ERM. Woods (2009) performed a case study
focused on a public sector entity's risk management control
system to examine whether risk management systems are
similar across large organizations by comparing the risk pro-
cess with the Institute of Risk Management (IRM; 2002)
model. Because the organization's process was easily
mapped to the IRM model, the author argued that large orga-
nizations' overall risk processes are similar, as many organi-
zations are following the IRM model. Woods also described
the use of heat maps (risk maps) to rank the organization's
risks on a scale from tolerable to material to severe (traffic
light), which determines the level of control and monitoring
(the resulting level of control and monitoring is the risk con-
trol system for the organization). The author concluded that
the control system was affected by government policy, tech-
nology, and organization size.
Jordan, Jørgensen, and Mitterhofer (2013) examined the
use of risk maps in the Norwegian petroleum industry as a
way to represent risks within project management. They
found that risk maps are being used to negotiate the boundar-
ies of different project areas. The appearance of a risk object
on a risk map resulted in it being more likely to be discussed.
The risk maps were used to mediate concerns between groups
and resulted in topics not shown being avoided, thus setting
boundaries on the meeting discussions. Overall, the risk
maps were used to create project identity, increase commit-
ment to the project, and mediate between different groups in
the company.
Studies that used surveys have each developed their own
set of questions and surveyed a variety of groups, such as the
American Institute of Certified PublicAccountants (AICPA),
The Conference Board, companies listed on the two Nordic
stock exchanges, and firms based in the Netherlands. Paape
and Spekle (2012) examined design choices of ERM by
firms and the effects of the choices on risk management
effectiveness. The authors found that the frequency of risk
assessments and risk reporting and the use of quantitative
approaches are associated with higher stages of ERM imple-
mentation. They also found that use of the COSO framework
did not contribute to higher risk management effectiveness.
Another article based on the COSO ERM framework,
Gates, Nicolas, and Walker (2012), surveyed Conference
Board member firms to study the practical side of ERM.3
Based on 150 completed responses, the authors modeled the
direct impact that each of the components has on the subse-
quent component beginning with objective setting through
performance. The study found that a structured approach to
risk management can result in enhanced management and
improved performance.
Beasley, Branson, and Pagach (2015) examined specific
risk management processes associated with greater ERM
maturity using a sample of 645 organizations across a number
of industries. They found ERM maturity to be positively asso-
ciated with boards of directors that are more actively engaged
in risk oversight. ERM maturity also was positively related to
organizations with risk management responsibilities assigned
to a board committee, formal risk management reports to the
board, and a formally articulated risk appetite.
Lundqvist (2014b) used survey results from 153 firms on
two Nordic stock exchanges to understand ERM implemen-
tation and found four ERM implementation factors: (1) gen-
eral internal environment and objective setting, (2) specific
risk identification and risk assessment activities, (3) holistic
organization of risk management, and (4) general control
activities and information and communication. Lundqvist
explained that Factors 1 and 4 could be viewed as "prerequi-
sites" of an ERM implementation because they are necessary
to support ERM but can exist without any effort toward risk
management. Factor 2 represents efforts by the organization
to manage certain types of risks, such as financial and com-
pliance. Lundqvist identified Factor 3 as the true ERM iden-
tifier. Factor 3 represents organizational activities such as a
formal, written risk appetite definition, senior management
responsible for overseeing risk and risk management, and
formal risk management reports provided to the board on a
regular schedule. These activities are typical of firms
approaching risk holistically the definition of ERM.
Ittner and Oyon's (2014) data consisted of responses from
the corporate-level finance and risk executives of 1,051
international firms in multiple industries. The authors found
that the breath of functional and hierarchical ownership of
risk is positively associated with the sophistication of a
firm's ERM implementation and that management practices
are more closely associated with the levels and functions of
the risk owners, not the number of owners. When the CFO of
a firm has risk ownership, significantly larger contributions
are made to a wider range of strategic and operational risks.
Finally, Viscelli, Hermanson, and Beasley (2016) con-
ducted a series of semi-structured interviews with 15 ERM
champions representing 14 organizations headquartered in
the United States to gain insight into how firms actually
implement ERM. They found that most firms began their
process by developing a list of risks. Very few of the firms
provided formal education on ERM to the employees
involved in the ERM implementation. Most of the organiza-
tions did not define risk appetite. The most positive ERM
impact on the firm was greater risk awareness, risk manage-
ment, and risk mitigation, and more timely dissemination of
risk information was identified as the Number 1 change to
the firm.
Key implications for boards. Akey "takeaway" from our analy-
sis of ERM research to address our second question of inter-
est (What techniques comprise an ERM process?) is that
there is no one specific approach used by organizations to
implement ERM. While several organizations mentioned
they have found some benefit in considering aspects of an
ERM framework, such as COSO (2004), our review of the
8 SAGE Open
research suggests that organizations approach the launch of
ERM in a number of different ways, and they have not
focused on implementing all elements laid out in an ERM
framework. Some start by leveraging existing processes,
while others start by appointing individuals to serve in new
CRO roles or they create a RMC among the executive team
to launch the process. But, one common aspect noted in sev-
eral studies is that most organizations engaged management
in an initial risk identification task early in an ERM launch,
and a number of those organizations used "heat maps (risk
maps)" to summarize the most important risks identified.
Opportunities for future research.The limited access to data
about specific techniques and internal processes used by
organizations as they implement ERM has limited the ability
to conduct academic research about the effectiveness of
those processes. There is limited knowledge about specific
factors that may affect the effectiveness of any number of
ERM processes. Research that sheds insights into tools and
techniques, including both their advantages and disadvan-
tages, would be extremely beneficial to better understand
factors that strengthen an entity's overall risk oversight. As
researchers can gain access to data about specific ERM
implementations, there are a number of important research
questions specific to ERM implementation processes that
warrant academic study by governance scholars. We sum-
marize a number of research questions related to ERM
implementations in column B of Appendix A.
Internal Auditing and ERM
In response to growing expectations for more effective board
risk governance, a number of boards have called upon IA to
assist them with their ERM efforts. In many organizations,
the audit committee of the board is responsible for oversight
of the IA function, and there are direct lines of communica-
tion between IA and the board via the audit committee.
Because IA has an enterprise-wide focus and because IA pro-
cedures are often risk-based, a number of boards of directors
have initially assigned responsibility for ERM leadership to
IA. However, in doing so, some boards may question what
IA's role in ERM should be, and they may have concerns
about how ERM leadership affects IA's objectivity.
The IA function, especially the chief audit executive, is
frequently tasked with the leadership of ERM implementa-
tion (Viscelli et al., 2016). While there is disagreement in the
IA community about how closely the Institute of Internal
Auditors (IIA; 2004) guidelines about IA involvement in
ERM should be followed, there is agreement that IA should
never "own" risk, because owning the risk would jeopardize
IA's independence and objectivity in evaluating risk (Jackson,
2005). Several articles discuss the appropriate role of the IA
function in ERM.
The IIA released a position paper, The Role of Internal
Auditing in Enterprise-Wide Risk Management (IIA, 2004),
shortly after COSO (2004) released its ERM framework. The
IIA provided guidance on the roles internal auditors should
or should not perform in risk management, and it stated that
IA's core role is to "provide objective assurance to the board
on the effectiveness of risk management" (p. 3). Some prac-
tice-based polls of IA practitioners provide some insights
about consistency with the IIA guidelines. For example,
Gramling and Myers (2006) found in a survey that the
responsibilities held by internal auditors differed somewhat
from The IIA's guidelines, but that internal auditors under-
stood the guidance. Also, Sobel (2011) surveyed IIA mem-
bers through the IIA's Global Audit Information (GAIN)
Flash system and found that IA was not participating in core
ERM roles, consistent with IIA guidelines on ERM imple-
mentation. In addition, Thompson (2013) provided a frame-
work that can be used to evaluate the potential conflicts that
an internal auditor might face while implementing ERM.
Fraser and Henry (2007) found in a study of U.K. compa-
nies that internal auditors were playing a bigger role in ERM
than recommended by the IIA, and there was concern that
they were doing so at the risk of losing independence.
Interviews revealed that internal auditors were in the role of
risk management facilitators and consultants, rather than
evaluators of risk management processes. This raised the
question of whether the internal auditors were maintaining
their independence.
Beasley, Clune, and Hermanson (2008) focused on the
macro-level impact of ERM on IA. They surveyed 122 firms
and found that, overall, ERM implementation positively
affects IA by expanding IA's work as the organization pro-
gressed through its implementation. This is not surprising, as
ERM implementation requires significant resources, and, as
outlined by The IIA's guidelines, there are many roles for IA
in the process. The authors also found a greater impact on IA
by ERM when the CFO and audit committee have called for
IA to have greater involvement in the ERM process and
when IA has a greater role in leadership of the ERM imple-
mentation. This suggests that CFOs and audit committees
may recommend that IA take a leadership role, thus leading
to an impact on IA resources, which could lead to a loss of
independence. The authors did not conclude whether greater
IA involvement in ERM was helpful or harmful to IA's inde-
pendence and objectivity.
Key implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to
address our third question of interest (What is the role of IA
in ERM?) indicates that IA has played an active role in the
initial launch of ERM in a number of organizations. In some
ways, this is not surprising given the board of directors often
delegates day-to-day responsibility for the board's risk over-
sight to the audit committee. Because the audit committee
has direct oversight responsibility over IA, it is not surpris-
ing that boards, through their audit committees, have asked
IA to assume some ERM leadership. However, that has led to
concerns about continuing to use IA in an ERM leadership
role. A number of studies have called attention to the impact
of IA's leadership of ERM on its ability to
Viscelli et al. 9
objectively evaluate the functioning and effectiveness of the
organization's ERM processes. Boards may benefit from
considering whether IA should continue in its ERM leader-
ship role.
Opportunities for future research. Because many ERM imple-
mentations have been facilitated by internal auditors, there
are a number of research questions related to the impact of
that reality. Although most IA functions use a risk-based
approach to their audit scoping, it is uncertain the extent to
which IA activities focus on risks beyond operations, finan-
cial reporting, and compliance into those risks related to
strategy. In addition, while there are concerns about the
potential compromising of IA objectivity and independence
when IA assumes responsibility for ERM implementation,
there is limited research as to whether that concern can be
empirically supported. In response, we summarize, in col-
umn C of Appendix A, a number of future research questions
that governance scholars could examine to provide addi-
tional insights about the role of IA in ERM.
Research Insights Related to Board's Evaluation
of Risk Information Generated by ERM Processes
In addition to responsibilities related to understanding and
approving management's approach to risk oversight, boards
also are responsible for understanding risk information out-
put from the ERM process as part of the board's oversight of
management. Conceptually, ERM is a process designed to
increase the likelihood that entity objectives are achieved
(COSO, 2004). Thus, ultimately, ERM is designed to provide
strategic value. But, as boards evaluate information gener-
ated by ERM processes in organizations they serve, they may
have questions about how organizations integrate ERM with
the strategy of the organization, and they may ask whether
ERM processes actually enhance stakeholder value. We
examine ERM-related research to summarize insights to
these governance questions:
a. How are organizations integrating ERM processes
with strategy?
b. How does ERM affect firm value and performance?
c. How does organizational culture affect the value of
ERM?
We use these questions as a framework for organizing our
understanding of insights from ERM-related research per-
formed to date and we build upon that to generate a number
of future research topics that governance scholars may con-
sider for future examination.
ERM and Strategy
The COSO (2004) framework emphasizes that ERM is a pro-
cess "applied in strategy setting" designed "to provide rea-
sonable assurance regarding the achievement of entity
objectives" (p. 2). That definition indicates that ERM is
intended to focus on the management of risks affecting the
strategy a firm uses to achieve its objectives. Similarly, Frigo
and Anderson (2011) stated that ERM must take place within
a strategic setting to actually create value.4 Despite these
assertions, the academic literature indicates that firms typi-
cally are struggling to effectively link ERM to strategy.5
Beasley, Branson, and Pagach (2015) examined firm-spe-
cific factors associated with the perceived strategic value of
ERM, using a sample of 645 organizations across a number
of industries. They found that ERM is more likely to be
viewed as a strategic tool when the organization has stated its
risk appetite in the strategic planning process and when the
board of directors receives, at least annually, a management
report describing top risks. As for management-level pro-
cesses, they found greater linkage of ERM and strategy when
the organization has a management-level risk committee,
provides ERM training to executives, and regularly updates
the key risk inventories. Interestingly, they also found that
the presence of an explicit relationship between executive
compensation and risk management increases the perceived
strategic value of ERM. In addition, larger firms were more
likely to view ERM as a strategic tool, while private firms
were more likely than public firms to view ERM as value
adding.
Cohen, Krishnamoorthy, and Wright (2014) interviewed
CFOs, audit committee members, and audit partners within
the same firms (which they referred to as the governance
triad) for 11 organizations. They found that CFOs and audit
committee members more often included strategic elements
in their definition of ERM than did audit partners. In only
two of the organizations did all three members of the gover-
nance triad mention strategy. Of the remaining organizations,
half had triads where the majority of the triad members noted
strategy in their responses, and in most of those triads, the
audit committee member and the CFO were the ones noting
the strategy connection most often. When asked about their
individual role in addressing risks related to the four objec-
tives (strategic, operational, reporting, and compliance) out-
lined in the COSO (2004) ERM framework, the CFOs and
the audit committee members were more likely to respond
that they played a significant role in assessing risks related to
the strategic objective. The external auditors saw their role as
weak in the assessment of risks related to the strategic objec-
tive. The authors also reviewed the responses through the
lens of agency theory and resource dependence theory. While
they found that ERM was mostly playing a monitoring role
(agency theory), they did see it being used to balance corpo-
rate strategy and business risks (resource dependence) in
some cases.
Viscelli et al. (2016) interviewed ERM champions in
14 organizations and found that most of the organizations
adopted ERM due to a "strategic need to understand
risk." However, the most common area cited by inter-
viewees for future improvement in the ERM process was
10 SAGE Open
the link to strategic planning, and making ERM more a
part of the organization's strategy was cited when asked
about goals for the ERM implementation over the next 3
to 5 years. Overall, the responses seem to indicate that
ERM's strategic impact is limited and that the ERM
implementation process often begins with a resource
dependence/strategic focus, but ultimately emerges as
more of an agency theory/monitoring tool. As a result, the
overall impact of ERM is limited by the failure to tightly
link ERM and strategy.
In a study of 110 non-financial Canadian firms, Ben-
Amar, Boujenoui, and Zéghal (2014) found that a firm's risk
management approach is directed by the firm's corporate
strategy. Content analysis was performed on annual reports
for 2007 to examine risk management. The authors reported
that a firm's business sector affects the risk exposure level,
perception of risk consequences, and risk management strat-
egy for both individual risks and risk categories.
Key implications for boards. Akey "takeaway" from our analy-
sis of ERM research to address our fourth question of interest
(How are organizations integrating ERM processes with
strategy?) is that while ERM is envisioned to provide an
organization the opportunity to identify and manage risks
most likely to affect the organization's achievement of its
strategic objectives, the integration of ERM and strategy has
not been fully achieved, and organizations are struggling to
fully leverage the strategic benefits of ERM. Organizations
that have realized some strategic benefit are found to have
boards of directors more engaged in the risk governance
process.
Opportunities for future research. Future research is needed on
the processes and activities used to incorporate ERM into
strategic planning, the related keys to how organizations
have successfully connected risk management and strategic
planning, and the extent that ERM is considered a priority for
running the business. We summarize in column A of Appen-
dix B a number of research questions related to the integra-
tion of ERM and strategy that can be examined by governance
scholars to provide insight to boards to help them properly
position risk governance for strategic value.
Firm Value and Performance
As noted in the COSO definition of ERM, the goal of an
effective ERM process is to increase the likelihood that orga-
nizations achieve their objectives. Although that is conceptu-
ally appealing, a number of boards may question whether
actual ERM implementations have demonstrated value-add-
ing contributions.6 To explore answers to that question, we
examine prior ERM research for insights about the associa-
tion of ERM with firm value and performance.
Nocco and Stulz (2006) argued that the implementation of
an integrated, holistic risk management environment (ERM)
can be used to create value by better managing risk at a
macro and micro level. By looking across the enterprise's
risks and coordinating them, ERM helps to ensure that no
single project has a negative impact on the firm (Stulz, 1996).
Unlike Nocco and Stulz (2006), Schiller and Prpich (2014)
argued that ERM is lacking in solid empirical validation that
the comprehensiveness is worth the effort, and its adoption is
limited by its lack of solid theoretical support. The authors
also point out that ERM does not provide institutional design
recommendations.
While ERM has been widely accepted, there has been
some resistance to the value proposition of ERM. For exam-
ple, Power (2009) argued that ERM encourages a "logic of
auditability," which results in process-based rules with an
ever-expanding reach leading to "the risk management of
everything" (Power, 2004). The author also argues that the
narratives of risk management cannot articulate nor compre-
hend the interconnectedness of critical risks. Power (2009)
suggested that business continuity management (BCM) is a
better way to manage risk because it potentially has a better
consideration of interconnectedness. Overall, Power (2009)
suggested that ERM ultimately can lead to the "risk manage-
ment of nothing." These views illustrate how some question
whether ERM has the potential to be value adding.
Beasley, Pagach, and Warr (2008) used announcements of
appointments of senior executives into ERM roles such as
CRO to proxy for the launch of ERM. In a sample of 120
announcements of a senior executive being appointed to an
ERM role, they found that there are significant relations
between the magnitude of abnormal returns for the 2-day
period surrounding the announcement and certain firm-spe-
cific characteristics. The authors state,
For nonfinancial firms, announcement period returns are
positively associated with firm size and the volatility of prior
periods' reported earnings and negatively associated with
leverage and the extent of cash on hand relative to liabilities. For
financial firms, however, there are fewer statistical associations
between announcement returns and firm characteristics.
(pp. 311-312)
Overall, the study found that the value of ERM is dependent
on the overall risk profile of the firm, with shareholders of
higher risk firms placing greater value on the announcements
of CRO appointments relative to other firms.
Gordon, Loeb, and Tseng (2009) used a word search to iden-
tify 122 firms that disclosed ERM activities. Using Compustat
data to measure strategy, operations, reporting, and compliance
(the four objectives in COSO's ERM Framework), they devel-
oped an index of the effectiveness of a firm's ERM initiative.
The ERM effectiveness measure was then used in a regression
with independent variables representing firm characteristics.7
The authors used a subsample of high performance firms, as
measured by 1-year excess stock returns (2% or better), to
establish coefficients (best practices) of the firm characteristics
of high performing firms. The authors then developed an opti-
mum ERM score, which was compared with actual ERM
Viscelli et al. 11
scores. They found that the smaller the difference in optimum
score and actual score, the greater the expected performance.
The results of the study indicated that firms whose ERM initia-
tive characteristics were properly aligned with the firm's char-
acteristics should experience greater firm performance.
Hoyt and Liebenberg (2011) performed a similar word
search as Gordon et al. (2009) to identify insurance firms
between 1998 and 2005 that had ERM initiatives. Using
Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value, they found that firms
with an ERM initiative had a higher median change in value
than firms without an ERM initiative. On average, their
results showed that firms with ERM initiatives were valued
approximately 4% higher than firms without an ERM initia-
tive. However, unlike Hoyt and Liebenberg (2011), Lin et al.
(2012) found that the market responded negatively to ERM
adoption in a study of insurance firms using Tobin's Q and a
similar word search to identify ERM adoption.
McShane, Nair, and Rustambekov (2011) also used
Tobin's Q as a proxy for firm value and the S&P ERM rat-
ing. The authors found that insurance firms experienced an
increase in firm value as the firms increased their risk man-
agement sophistication in traditional risk categories. As
the firms moved beyond silo risk management to a coordi-
nated (holistic) approach, the firms did not see an increase
in firm value. This suggests that firms achieve a higher
level of performance as the firm improves overall risk
management and controls, but further performance
improvement is not apparent as firms move into more
advanced ERM processes.
Gupta, Prakash, and Rangan (2012) examined 73 publicly
traded firms, using a word search (1999-2009) to find the
announcement of a CRO, and found that the market was
more likely to react positively, as measured by increase in
stock price, if the organization had few outside directors,
suggesting that CRO appointments may lead to better
governance.
Nair, Rustambekov, McShane, and Fainshmidt (2014)
examined 60 insurance firms during the 2008 financial crisis
to determine if the ERM processes align with the dynamic
capabilities of the firm, allowing firms to better manage a
changing environment. They calculated the stock decline
between October 9, 2007 (S&P peak) and March 6, 2009
(S&P lowest point). Profitability return was calculated from
the lowest point and post-crisis high in April 2011. Using the
S&P rating, translated to a scale of 1 (weak) to 5 (excellent),
they found that a superior ERM rating (5) resulted in a
smaller stock decline during the downturn and superior prof-
itability during the recovery period.8
Baxter et al. (2013) examined 165 insurance and banking
firm-years that received ERM ratings from S&P from 2006
to 2008 to investigate the rating in relation to firm perfor-
mance as measured by return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's
Q. They found that firms with a higher ERM rating had
higher operating performance (ROA) and higher Tobin's Qs.
The authors attributed this to ERM helping to mitigate risks
and/or allowing the firms to take advantage of opportunities.
The study also found that firms receiving a strong/excellent
ERM rating initially had a stronger market reaction to the
disclosure of the rating than those with lower ratings. In
addition, they considered the time period before the global
financial crisis, during the crisis, and after the crisis. They
found a strong relationship between higher ERM ratings and
market value only after the crisis and attributed this to inves-
tors looking for information such as the ERM rating to pro-
vide insight into a firm's ability to address future risks.
In an additional study evaluating ERM maturity and firm
value as measured by Tobin's Q, Farrell and Gallagher
(2015) used the Risk Management Society (RIMS) risk
maturity model (RMM) to evaluate whether ERM maturity
had an impact on firm value. Using the results collected from
2006 to 2011, which resulted in 225 firms across various
industries, the authors found that there is significant evi-
dence that ERM maturity has a positive impact on firm value.
For firms with an overall RMM score of 3 to 5 (mature), firm
value increased 25% and was highly significant as measured
by Tobin's Q. All of the areas of the RMM online tool were
found to affect value, except risk appetite management and
business resilience and sustainability.
In a study of U.S. insurers who answered the Tillinghast
Powers Perrin ERM survey of 2004 and 2006, Grace, Leverty,
Phillips, and Shimpi (2015) studied cash flow implications of
the adoption of ERM and found that organizations having a
cross-functional dedicated risk manager who reported to the
board or CEO, along with a simple economic model, had sig-
nificant increases in revenue and cost efficiency.
Key implications for boards. Our analysis of ERM research to
address our fifth question of interest (How does ERM affect
firm value and performance?) reveals evidence that imple-
mentations of ERM do affect positively different measures
of firm value. Some studies find stock market reactions to
ERM implementation announcements, while others (but not
all) find a relationship between ERM and firm value as mea-
sured by Tobin's Q. Thus, there is empirical evidence that
there is a connection between ERM and value creation.
Opportunities for future research. Because questions about the
value relevance of ERM are often posed by boards of direc-
tors and senior executives who may be reluctant to embrace
ERM as an effective risk oversight technique, further
research is needed that might help to demonstrate whether, or
when, ERM provides value to organizations. While there is
some research that suggests ERM does provide measurable
value, more research is needed to expand our understanding
of the various dimensions of value for ERM. We summarize
in column B of Appendix B a number of research questions
that governance scholars could examine in future research.
Culture and ERM
Three of the major organizational change initiatives of recent
decades, reengineering, total quality management (TQM),
12 SAGE Open
and firm downsizing, have had less than stellar success
(Cameron & Quinn, 2006). Lack of organizational culture fit
to an initiative was given as a common reason for failure,
leading to the belief that an organization's culture and strat-
egy must be aligned to be successful. As ERM is a change
initiative similar to the previously mentioned initiatives, it is
reasonable to assume that an organization's culture would be
a significant factor in explaining the strategic value of ERM.
Mikes (2009) found in a longitudinal study of two banks that
two cultures emerged, "ERM by the Numbers," driven by a
strong shareholder value imperative, and "Holistic ERM," driven
by a risk-based internal-control imperative. The ERM by the
Numbers firm relied heavily on calculations for quantitative risks,
which resulted in a diagnostic risk model.The Holistic ERM firm
quantified risks but did not rely solely on the numbers. Also,
senior risk managers with intimate knowledge of the business
sectors responded to management's concerns and thus influenced
the actions beyond what the numbers might have shown.
In a follow-on study, Mikes (2011) interviewed 53 indi-
viduals in risk management positions at five major banks over
the period of 2001-2010. The article sought to determine if the
pursuit of expanding risk measurement in risk management
was leading to a dysfunctional environment, as espoused by
Power (2009) and Tabel (2007), and if the type of culture as
defined in Mikes (2009) explained why some organizations
become committed to risk measurements, whereas others do
not. The author used boundary-work to suggest that organiza-
tions that are "ERM by the Numbers" create risk measure-
ments that imply the expertise on risk lies in the risk
organizations and can lead to greater organizational control.
Mikes described these organizations as having "quantitative
enthusiasm" and being dedicated to risk measurements.
Organizations that approach ERM in a holistic manner focus
on combining risk measures with experience and intuition to
develop soft measurements, which better reflect the risk of
non-measurable strategic risks. The approach seems to leave
the boundaries blurred as to where the expertise lies in an
organization. These organizations were described as having
"quantitative skepticism" and providing top management with
alternative scenarios on emerging risks.
Cooper, Faseruk, and Khan (2013) performed a meta-
analysis of practitioner studies to determine the relationship
between ERM and organizational culture. By grouping rele-
vant questions from 14 major risk studies published from
2006 through 2010, the authors analyzed the responses from
the perspective that organizational culture was a "major ben-
efit" or a "major barrier" to implementation of ERM. Their
study did not put forth an answer to this question but did find
that a significant number of entities consider organizational
culture important to ERM implementation.
A common way of describing organizational culture is on
a continuum from mechanistic to organic (Burns & Stalker,
1961). Mechanistic cultures have a chain of command struc-
ture in the form of rankings of positions, vertical communi-
cation paths, and decisions driven down to employees from
top management. On the other end of the continuum, organic
cultures have a network of control and authority, lateral com-
munication paths, and employees who receive information
and advice in a cooperative manner rather than instructions
from supervisors.
Kimbrough and Componation (2009) used an instrument,
Organizational Culture Assessment (OCA; Reigle, 2001,
2003), which was based on the mechanistic/organic continuum
of Burns and Stalker (1961), to study how the organizational
culture framework is related to ERM implementation. In a
study of 116 firms from 21 different industries, the authors
found that organizations with higher organic scores were more
likely to have a risk management program, were more likely to
state that culture aided in the speed and effectiveness of ERM
implementation, and were more satisfied overall with the effec-
tiveness of the firm's ERM program. Firms with higher OCA
scores (organic culture) were more likely to answer "yes" to the
question of whether the firm's culture has been modified to
support ERM. This finding is not surprising given that organic
firms are more open to change and innovation. The study did
not find that culture was related to the presence of a CRO, but
for the firms that did have a CRO, the firms with organic cul-
tures were more likely to have a formal risk management pro-
cess and to be further along in the ERM implementation.
Similarly, Kleffner, Lee, and McGannon (2003) found that a
hindrance to ERM adoption was a silo mentality at firms due to
the firms' organizational structure, which could be interpreted
as a characteristic of a mechanistic culture.
Key implications for boards. Akey "takeaway" from our analysis
of ERM research to address our final question of interest (How
does organizational culture affect the value of ERM?) is that
organizational culture has a significant impact on the decision
to implement ERM and on the effectiveness of that implemen-
tation. Some have argued that "culture is king" when it comes
to ERM. Without sufficient support of ERM by the CEO or
board of directors, organizations may struggle in their efforts to
find strategic value in their ERM processes. Thus, boards may
need to consider the organization's culture as it evaluates the
effectiveness of management's risk management processes.
Opportunities for future research. Because research about the
role of culture in the context of ERM is limited, additional
studies are warranted to answer the question as to how orga-
nizational culture influences an ERM implementation.
Research about elements of culture that affect the overall
effectiveness of ERM is needed to help boards and senior
executives in their efforts to implement risk oversight pro-
cesses that help them navigate risks that may be on the hori-
zon. We summarize in column C of Appendix B a number of
potential research questions related to the role of culture in
ERM that governance scholars may want to examine.
Conclusion
ERM is emerging corporate governance topic, particularly for
boards of directors as they respond to increasing expectations
Viscelli et al. 13
for more effective risk governance. ERM has become a major
focus of many organizations because of legislation and regula-
tions, as well as recent corporate failures. While the academic
research related to ERM is emerging, it is still in its early
stages. Despite that, we believe that there are a number of key
insights from research conducted to date that boards may ben-
efit from considering. We have highlighted a number of those
in this article and in Table 1. We also believe that there are
many other potential research questions that warrant rigorous
academic study by governance scholars. In this article, we
have identified a number of research questions in Appendices
A and B related to the two primary ERM-related responsibili-
ties of the board of directors.
In some ways, the academic world's embrace of ERM has
lagged the business world. There is tremendous opportunity
for researchers to contribute insights that would be highly
relevant to business leaders, and this study attempts to pro-
vide motivation to encourage scholars to continue their
examination of a number of issues that can inform key gov-
ernance players, including the board of directors and audit
committee, in their risk governance efforts.
Research is needed along multiple dimensions of
ERM, and expertise bridging a number of academic fields
is needed. Because ERM is intended to oversee risks aris-
ing across the enterprise, academic experts in a variety of
business disciplines (i.e., accounting, finance, informa-
tion technology [IT], marketing, strategy, and organiza-
tional behavior), in addition to experts in disciplines
beyond business (i.e., economics, sociology, psychology,
industrial engineering, computer science, statistics, and
data analytics) have significant opportunities to contrib-
ute to our understanding of ERM. More importantly,
research that integrates academic analysis of business
and non-business disciplines can provide unique insights
about what works well and what does not in managing the
volume of complex risks facing enterprises. Because
organizations will always face risks in the pursuit of
value, organizations will constantly be seeking insights
about more effective techniques to proactively manage
the risks that may emerge. The academic community is
uniquely positioned to assist with providing rigorous
analyses that will provide insight into the effectiveness of
ERM processes. The landscape of research questions
related to ERM is open and diverse. The academic com-
munity needs to take advantage of this significant
opportunity.

Notes
1. For example, Acharyya and Johnson (2006) interviewed four
insurance companies and found the answers so diverse that
they concluded the implementation of enterprise risk manage-
ment (ERM) varies widely.
2. The components were (a) processes for identifying, assessing,
and prioritizing risks; (b) frequency of risk meetings; and (c)
risk tools. The types of risk were (a) preventable, (b) strategy
execution, and (c) external (as proposed by Kaplan & Mikes,
2012).
3. The survey questions measured eight components: (a) objec-
tive setting, (b) risk identification, (c) risk reaction, (d)
oversight, (e) information and communication, (f) internal
environment, (g) management, and (h) performance.
4. Funston (2004) found that of the 100 companies with the big-
gest stock-price loss during 1995 to 2004, 66 experienced stra-
tegic risks and 80% of the largest loss firms experienced two
or more interrelated risks. Slywotzky and Drzik (2005) argued
that companies are becoming better at managing overall cor-
porate risks but have yet to address the management of strate-
gic risks.
5. Gates (2006), in a survey of 271 The Conference Board mem-
bers, found that 66% of the firms were implementing ERM to
foster a greater understanding of strategic risks but were more
willing to accept strategic risks over more traditional risks,
such as legal or financial risks.
6. Kraus and Lehner (2012) reviewed the ERM literature on value
creation. They found that there is a lack of reliable proxies for

value and an inability to determine what part of ERM influ-
ences value.
7. The independent variables used were environmental uncer-
tainty (earnings volatility), industry competition (highly com-
petitive), firm size (total assets), firm complexity (diversity of
business transactions), and monitoring by the board (size of
board divided by the log of sales).
8. Aebi, Sabato, and Schmid (2012) found that banks with a chief
risk officer (CRO) who reported to board instead of the CEO
exhibited higher stock returns and return on equity (ROE)
during the 2007/2008 financial crisis than firms whose CRO
reported the CEO. Eckles, Hoyt, and Miller (2014) found that
insurance companies that adopted ERM experienced a reduc-
tion in stock volatility that gradually grew over time.
