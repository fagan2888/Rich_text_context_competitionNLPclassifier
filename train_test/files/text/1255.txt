The association between serum osmolality
and lung function among adults
Z.E.K. Pogson, T.M. McKeever and A. Fogarty
ABSTRACT: The extensive pulmonary vasculature results in the lungs being intimately exposed
to circulating blood. As increased serum osmolality may be associated with an increase in pro-
inflammatory activity, this has the potential to result in damage to the lungs and reduced lung
function. The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that increased serum
osmolality is associated with a lower forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced
vital capacity (FVC).
The present study was a cross-sectional study of 10,602 participants in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aged o17 yrs for whom there were adequate data on all
outcomes and exposures.
After adjustment for age, smoking and other confounding factors, increased serum osmolality
was inversely associated with both FEV1 and FVC. An increase of 1 SD in serum osmolality was
associated with a decrease in both FEV1 of 19.8 mL and FVC of 35.3 mL. The constituent assays
demonstrated a complex relationship with both FEV1 and FVC.
Increased serum osmolality was associated with decreased forced expiratory volume in one
second and forced vital capacity. If causal, this may have implications for the understanding of the
processes that are involved in the pathophysiology of decline in lung function.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) affects up to 24 million people
in the USA, has a global prevalence of 9­
10% in adults aged .40 yrs [1] and is a major
cause of morbidity and mortality. Although
cigarette smoking is the main risk factor for the
development of COPD [2], ,18% of adults living
in the USA with undiagnosed airflow obstruction
have never smoked cigarettes, suggesting that
other factors contribute to the pathophysiological
processes involved [3]. These include blood
glucose level, which has been demonstrated to
be inversely related to forced expiratory volume
in one second (FEV1) [4­18]. Plasma glucose is
one of the molecules that contribute towards
serum osmolality (along with sodium, chloride
and potassium ions, and urea). Human epithelial
cells respond to alterations in the osmolality of
their local environment by changes in transmem-
brane ion transport [19], which may constitute
part of the airways' physiological response to a
change in the humidity or temperature of inhaled
air. In a rat model, an increase in serum osmola-
lity is associated with a systemic increase in pro-
inflammatory cytokine levels [20]. The increase in
neutrophils, eosinophils and inflammatory cyto-
kines in induced sputum after dietary salt load-
ing in adults suggests that the pro-inflammatory
effect of salt loading extends to the lungs in
humans [21], and this effect may be mediated by
changes in serum osmolality [20, 22]. Since COPD
is associated with airway inflammation [23­27],
it was hypothesised that serum osmolality is
inversely related to lung function as measured
by FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). This
hypothesis was tested by examining the relation-
ship between serum osmolality and its constitu-
ent nutrients with lung function using the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) cross-sectional dataset.
METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study population
The present study was conducted using data
from the NHANES III, a cross-sectional survey
designed to examine the health and nutrition
of the noninstitutionalised US population.
Data were collected from .30,000 participants
between 1988 and 1994. Full details of the
examination and survey procedures have been

Data collection
The questionnaire data were initially collected by trained
interviewers who gathered information on a number of factors,
including race/ethnicity, medical history, socioeconomic sta-
tus, use of medication and smoking history. Participants then
attended sessions in a mobile examination unit in which blood
samples were obtained for biochemical assays. These included
serum osmolality, and sodium, potassium, urea and plasma
glucose concentrations. The measured serum osmolality assay
was an additional blood assay performed once the NHANES
data collection was already underway, and the present study
population consists of those who were eligible to provide a
sample for serum osmolality analysis. Height and weight
measurements were obtained and used to calculate body mass
index (BMI). Data on lung function were collected in order to
provide measures of FEV1 and FVC. Spirometry was super-
vised by technicians who had completed formal spirometry
training. All participants were asked to perform at least five
FVC manoeuvres. The FEV1 and FVC used represented the
largest values from the acceptable manoeuvres. For a man-
oeuvre to be acceptable, it had to be a maximal exhalation free
of cough, excessive hesitation, leak, an obstructed mouthpiece,
variable effort or early termination.

Statistical analysis
Using self-reported smoking history, the participants were
classified into three groups: never-smokers, ex-smokers, and
current smokers. Lifetime cigarette consumption was quanti-
fied in pack-years. The association between serum osmolality
and lung function (FEV1 and FVC) was the primary outcome of
interest, and the associations between the results of the four
assays measuring contributors to osmolality (serum sodium,
chloride, potassium and urea and plasma glucose) and lung
function were examined as secondary outcome measures. The
data were analysed using linear regression. The likelihood
ratio test was used to assess the presence of linear trends. As
serum osmolality exhibited a linear relationship with lung
function, it is presented as the change in FEV1 and FVC per
16SD increment of exposure. Chloride concentration exhibited
a linear relationship with lung function, but sodium, potas-
sium, urea and glucose concentrations did not, and hence the
sizes of effect are presented in terms of lung function by
quintile of exposure of interest. All analyses were adjusted for
a priori confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, BMI, sex,
height, smoking status and smoking history. Owing to the
nonlinear relationship of BMI with lung function, this was
treated as a categorical variable. In addition, the analysis was
restricted to individuals with plasma glucose levels of ,7 mM
in order to exclude the possibility that any relationship
demonstrated was only related to hyperglycaemia. Potential
confounders were investigated and included poverty index
and serum levels of C-reactive protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, b-
carotene and vitamin C. They were only included in the model
if this resulted in a change in the measure of effect of o10%.
Data were considered significant if the p-value was ,0.05.
Whether there was any effect modification of the association
between osmolality and lung function by smoking status was
investigated. Owing to the complex multistage probability

sample design of the NHANES III, estimates were calculated
accounting for the survey design.
In a secondary analysis, the relationship between serum
osmolality and FEV1 was investigated for a nonlinear associa-
tion using fractional polynomials [29]. Briefly, in this method,
various models are explored and the two polynomial terms
which best fits a nonlinear relation between FEV1 and
osmolality are selected. However, this method does not permit
adjustment for the complex sampling frame used to collect
data for the NHANES.
RESULTS
A total of 13,893 individuals were eligible to provide a sample
for serum osmolality measurement. Of these, 10,602 (76%)
participants provided complete data for analysis and so
constitute the study population. Reasons for exclusion are
shown in figure 1. The present study population was similar to
the excluded population in terms of demographic character-
istics (table 1). The only significant differences were that the
study population was older (p50.001) and less likely to be
from a non-Hispanic black population (p,0.001).
Serum osmolality was significantly associated with a decrease
in FEV1 of 19.8 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) -30.3­ -9.3)
and FVC of 35.3 mL (95% CI -47.9­ -22.7) per 16SD increase in
serum osmolality. Restriction of the analysis to individuals
with plasma glucose levels of ,7 mM resulted in a decrease in
FEV1 of 14.8 mL (95% CI -26.0­ -3.6) and FVC of 26.3 mL (95%
CI -39.5­ -13.1) per 16SD increase in serum osmolality.
The associations of serum osmolality, serum sodium, potas-
sium, urea and chloride levels and plasma glucose level with
FEV1 and FVC are presented in tables 2 and 3, respectively.
This showed complex associations between the exposure of
interest and FEV1 and FVC. Mutual adjustment for the effect of

all of the constituents that contribute to serum osmolality
suggests that serum sodium level is inversely associated with
FEV1, whereas serum urea and chloride levels are positively
associated with FEV1, with similar relationships being
observed for FVC, with the addition of an inverse association
with increasing plasma glucose level.
There was no effect on these results after adjusting for the
potential confounding effects of poverty index and serum
levels of C-reactive protein, vitamin A, vitamin E, b-carotene
and vitamin C. There was no effect modification of the
association between serum osmolality and either FEV1 or
FVC by smoking status. There was no significant association
between serum osmolality and the FEV1/FVC ratio (data not
presented).
When the relationship between serum osmolality and FEV1
was examined using fractional polynomials, it was found that
elevated serum osmolality remained a significant predictor of
decrease in FEV1 (p50.002), although this relationship was
attenuated at lower serum osmolalities, as demonstrated in
figure 2.
DISCUSSION
The present study of a cross-sectional population of adults
from the USA demonstrated that increasing serum osmolality
is associated with decreased lung function in a generally linear
relationship, with a decrease of 19.8 mL for FEV1 and 35.3 mL
for FVC per 16SD increase in serum osmolality after adjusting
for likely confounding factors. There was a complex associa-
tion between the individual components of osmolality and
lung function. However, when all of the constituents were
adjusted for, serum urea and chloride ion concentration were
positively associated with lung function and serum sodium
and plasma glucose concentration were negatively associated
with lung function.
The strength of the present study lies in its use of biological
markers of serum osmolality and physiological measurements
of lung function in a well-defined population, ignorant of the
hypothesis being tested. NHANES III had a high participation
rate, with 86 and 78% of those invited, participating in the
questionnaire survey and medical examination, respectively
[28]. Complete data were available for 76% of those who were
eligible to participate. As those who provided complete data
were similar to those who did not, it was not considered likely
that selection bias would influence the present observations.
One limitation of the present study is its cross-sectional design,
which is unable to establish causality and susceptible to
reverse causality. It was considered unlikely that reverse
causality is the explanation for the association between higher
serum osmolality and lower lung function; indeed, it would be
anticipated that the increased ventilation associated with
higher lung function would lead to greater loss of water from
the airways and hence an increase in serum osmolality. It was
also not possible to exclude the possibility of residual
confounding from environmental exposures, such as recent
infection or pollution, which may impact upon both serum
osmolality and lung function.
To the best of the present authors' knowledge, this is the first
report of an inverse association between serum osmolality and
FEV1 and FVC, and it is important to consider the biological
plausibility of this observation and its consistency with other
data. Cells lining the human airways respond to hypertonicity
with changes in ion transfer and membrane conductance, and
it has been speculated that airway cells might play a role as an
osmotic transducer, sensing and responding to changes in their
local osmotic environment [19]. Evidence that increased
extracellular osmolality is associated with pro-inflammatory
effects is provided by studies manipulating serum osmolality
using salt-loading in rats, in which an increase in serum
osmolality resulted in an increase in levels of pro-inflamma-
tory cytokines, such as interleukin-1b, that was sustained after
rehydration [20]. Further in vitro studies support the concept
that high extracellular fluid osmolality modifies neutrophil
activity and leukotriene production, and that this is a
consequence of changes in extracellular osmolality rather than
changes in glucose concentration [30]. Thus changes in
osmolality have the potential to modify the activity of the
immune system with pro-inflammatory effects. The fact that, in
the present study, adjusting for levels of serum C-reactive
protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, did not affect the
results suggests that, if a rise in serum osmolality were pro-
inflammatory, this effect might possibly be localised to the
airways, or alternatively mediated by pathways not measured
by C-reactive protein. The concept that pulmonary inflamma-
tion can be mediated by changes in serum osmolality is
consistent with the observation that dietary salt-loading (which
may increase serum osmolality [22]) increased the amount of
both inflammatory cells and cytokines in the sputum of adults
with exercise-induced asthma [21]. Since COPD, a disease
defined by decreased lung function, is associated with airway
inflammation [23­27], it was speculated that an increase in
serum osmolality might play a role in the pathophysiology of
accelerated loss of lung function, although the absence of any
effect on the FEV1/FVC ratio suggests that this effect is
unlikely to result in an obstructive lung defect in the absence of
other risk factors
The relationships between lung function and the molecules
that contribute to serum osmolality are more complex.

This may be a consequence of the fact that the individual
contributions of the molecules that contribute to serum
osmolality can be difficult to quantify precisely, as demon-
strated by the observation that calculated osmolality varies
from directly measured osmolality by up to 35% [31], or that
the important exposure is the total serum osmolality rather
than that of a single constituent molecule. The present data
provide a potential mechanism to account for the consistent
inverse association between blood glucose level and lung
function reported in numerous cross-sectional studies [4­18]
since blood glucose contributes towards total serum osmol-
ality. In order to clarify the nature of the relationship between
osmolality and lung function, prospective studies with
adequate information regarding potential confounding factors
are required since cross-sectional associations identified
between exposure and lung function do not necessarily
indicate the existence of an association with decline in lung
function [32].
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated for the first time that
increasing serum osmolality is associated with lower lung
function. This provides a potential mechanism to explain the
previously observed relationship between glucose and lung
function. This observation is novel and deserves further
investigation.
