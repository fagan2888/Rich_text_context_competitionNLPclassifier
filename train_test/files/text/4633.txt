Introduction
Pregnancy places increased stress on the maternal cardio-
vascular system. The renin­angiotensin aldosterone system
(RAAS) is a hormone cascade responsible for blood pres-
sure homeostasis and is upregulated during pregnancy.1­3 A
significant increase in plasma volume is essential for a suc-
cessful pregnancy; these changes in plasma volume are
mediated in part by the actions of angiotensin (Ang) II on
the adrenal cortex, which releases aldosterone and stimu-
lates fluid retention.4
Ang II has vasopressor effects, increasing systemic vas-
cular resistance through central and peripheral actions. The
RAAS is activated in early pregnancy to maintain blood
pressure as maternal peripheral blood flow increases, par-
ticularly in the skin,5 kidneys6 and uterus.7 A rise in glo-
merular filtration rate (GFR)8 and an increase in
progesterone levels9 occur early in pregnancy and would
promote salt excretion if not offset by an activated RAAS.
As well, sodium retention has to occur to allow for the
increase in maternal blood volume and to meet the demands
of the growing fetus.
In pregnant women, plasma levels of active renin, and
its precursor prorenin, are increased. Prorenin levels
increase to 100 times those of active renin, while in non-
pregnant individuals they are only 10 times greater.10­12
Under physiological conditions, 2% of this prorenin will
spontaneously activate,13 thereby adding to the circulating
renin enzyme activity. Recently, we showed that decidual

Abstract
Hypothesis: There are fetal sex-associated differences in the circulating maternal renin­angiotensin system (RAS) in early
pregnancy.
Methods: Plasma prorenin, angiotensin (Ang) II, Ang 1-7 and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) concentrations were
measured at 15 weeks' gestation in 131 women with uncomplicated pregnancies from the Adelaide SCOPE cohort.
Uterine and umbilical artery Doppler sonography was performed at 20 weeks' gestation.
Results: At 15 weeks, women bearing female fetuses had higher maternal Ang II concentrations (p = 0.017) and lower
Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios (p = 0.016) than women bearing males. In women with male fetuses, Ang II positively correlated
with birth weight (p = 0.028) and prorenin negatively correlated with placental weight (p = 0.014). Female fetuses had
higher umbilical artery resistance indices (p = 0.019) that were related to maternal prorenin concentrations (p = 0.007).
Conclusions: In early human pregnancy, the maternal RAS is influenced by fetal sex. The lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios in
women with female fetuses may contribute to the lower maternal peripheral microvascular flow as described previously
and the lack of any positive effect of Ang II on fetal growth, as seen in women with male fetuses.

explants collected at term from women carrying a female
fetus secrete more prorenin ex vivo than explants collected
at term from women with a male fetus.14 Furthermore, these
sex-specific effects on decidual prorenin secretion were
still apparent when decidual explants were incubated for 48
hours ex vivo.
The activity of the RAAS is strongly influenced by the
sex steroids, oestrogen and progesterone.15­17 Most signifi-
cant is the effect of oestrogen on hepatic production of
angiotensinogen (AGT).18 Renin cleaves AGT to form Ang
I; a reaction rate limited by AGT levels. Ang I is cleaved by
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce Ang II.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the predomi-
nant enzyme for producing the heptapeptide Ang 1-7, with
this reaction 500 times faster when using Ang II as the sub-
strate rather than being generated from Ang I.19 Renin and
prorenin are also influenced by sex, being lower in the cir-
culation in women than in men, possibly because the influ-
ence of oestrogens on AGT generates more Ang II leading
to negative feedback on renin release.20,21 Conversely,
Broughton-Pipkin et al.,22 who examined the renin and
angiotensin levels in children less than 8 years of age, have
found that plasma renin activity and Ang II levels are lower
in boys than girls.
Ang peptides have been measured in pregnancy and
both plasmaAng II andAng (1-7) are increased.23,24 Urinary
Ang 1-7 also increases throughout gestation.25 Ang II has
not been measured in early gestation at the same time as
Ang 1-7. Ang 1-7 has been shown to be a vasodilator by
inducing endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production,26
kinins27 and prostaglandins28 so the balance between the
levels ofAng II andAng 1-7 may be important in regulating
maternal vascular tone. Interestingly, in preeclampsia and
gestational diabetes Ang (1-7) levels are low in late gesta-
tion.29,30 In order to fully elucidate the functional role of
these peptides in pregnancy and the use of Ang 1-7 and/or
Ang II as potential biomarkers for pregnancy pathologies
such as preeclampsia and gestational hypertension in which
the RAAS has been implicated,31 we first needed to estab-
lish the normal levels of these peptides and other compo-
nents of the RAAS in early gestation in women with
uncomplicated pregnancies.
We therefore tested the following hypotheses: first, that
a factor associated with fetal sex alters the balance between
the Ang II and Ang 1-7 axes of the maternal RAS; second,
these sex-based differences in angiotensin peptides are due
to differences in the upstream components of the RAS, i.e.
prorenin and ACE; third, since the circulating RAAS is a
key regulator of cardiovascular and renal function and Ang
II is a pro-inflammatory peptide,32,33 these differences in
circulating RAAS components would affect other measures
of maternal cardiovascular and renal health as well as a
marker of inflammation (C-reactive protein; CRP). Finally,
we postulated that differences in Ang peptides, and there-
fore differences in the vasodilator/vasoconstrictor balance,
would alter uterine artery and umbilical artery resistance
indices as well as fetal growth.
Materials and methods
Study design
The current study is a nested case-control study within the
Adelaide Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE)
cohort. Women attending the Lyell McEwin Hospital
(South Australia, Australia) were recruited, after giving
informed written consent, if they were nulliparous with a
singleton pregnancy, less than 15 weeks' gestation and had
fewer than three previous terminations of pregnancy or
miscarriages. Samples collected at 15 weeks' gestation
were selected if women had no pregnancy-associated com-
plications (n = 131), that is, if they remained normotensive
(<140 and/or <90 mmHg prior to labour), showed no pro-
teinuria, delivered a live born baby who was normally
grown after 37 weeks' gestation and had no other sign of
pregnancy complications. All the women included in the
current study self-reported as being Caucasian, except for
one who was listed as a Maori/Cook Islander. Ethics
approval for this work was given by the Central Northern
Adelaide Health Service Ethics of Human Research
Committee (study number: REC 1714/5/2008).
Sample collection
Non-fasting blood was collected into ethylenediaminetet-
raacetic acid (EDTA) vacutainers at 15 weeks' gestation by
venepuncture from patients who had been either sitting or
supine for 10 minutes (min). Blood pressure and other clin-
ical measurements were also recorded at this time. Mid-
stream urine was collected into 50 ml pots. All samples
were placed on ice before processing and storage at ­80°C
within 30 min of collection. Doppler sonography was con-
ducted at 20 weeks' gestation on the umbilical and uterine
arteries to measure blood flow resistance. Birth and placen-
tal weights were measured following delivery. Maternal
daily cigarette consumption from before and during preg-
nancy was also recorded.
Laboratory measurements
Plasma Ang II and Ang 1-7 were measured at ProSearch
International Australia Pty. Ltd. (Malvern, Victoria,
Australia) using a direct radioimmunoassay employing
delayed tracer addition. Ang II assay sensitivity was 4
pmol/l; with intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation
of 6.4% and 12%, respectively. Cross-reactivity to Ang I,
Ang 1-7 and all other pertinent hormones is 0.52%, 0.01%
and <0.1%, respectively. Cross-reactivity to Ang III and
Ang IV are 98% and 100%, respectively, as these peptides
have the same c-terminal as Ang II. Quality controls for
Sykes et al. 525
Ang II measured 35.9, 37.5 and 33.8 pmol/l. Ang 1-7 assay
sensitivity was 13 pmol/l; with intra- and inter-assay coef-
ficients of variation of 4.5% and 10%, respectively. Cross
reactivity to Ang I, Ang II, Ang III and Ang IV were 0.11%,
0.04%, 0.53% and 0.25%, respectively. Quality controls for
Ang 1-7 measured 135.8, 158.2 and 149.2 pmol/l. The Ang
1-7 to Ang II ratios were derived from the plasma concen-
trations of these peptides.
Maternal plasma concentrations of ACE (Duoset, R&D
Systems, MN, USA) and prorenin (Molecular Innovations,
MI, USA) were measured using commercially available
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits and conducted
according to manufacturer's instructions.
Biological analytes were measured by SA Pathology at
the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science (South
Australia, Australia). Plasma and urinary electrolytes
were measured using ion-selective electrodes, while cre-
atinine was measured using the Jaffé method and CRP
determined with an immuno-turbidimetric assay. All
assays were read on an Olympus AU5400 Chemistry-
Immuno Analyzer.
Data analysis
The rate pressure product, which is an indirect measure of
cardiac work, was calculated by multiplying heart rate and
systolic blood pressure. Plasma creatinine was used as a
surrogate measure of GFR because equations that derive
GFR from the plasma creatinine cannot be used in preg-
nancy because of the physiological changes in GFR and the
progressive changes in body weight.34 Urinary protein to
creatinine, urinary albumin to creatinine and urinary
sodium to potassium ratios were determined and the frac-
tional excretion of sodium calculated from the formula:
FENa (%) = (UNa × (PCr/1000))/(PNa × UCr)*100
Where UNa and PNa are urinary and plasma sodium levels
(mmol/l), respectively, and UCr and PCr are urinary (mmol/l)
and plasma creatinine levels (µmol/l), respectively.
Values are expressed as medians and interquartile ranges,
unless otherwise stated. Statistical significance was deemed
as p < 0.05. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to determine
fetal sex-dependent differences (male fetuses: n = 68, female

to identify significant relationships between RAS variables
thought to interact on a physiological basis. Data were ana-
lysed using Stata/IC 11.0 (StataCorp LP, TX, USA) and
scatter plots generated with this software. GraphPad Prism
5.0 was used to generate box and whisker plots.
Results
The only difference in maternal physiological variables,
measured at 15 weeks' gestation, between women who
subsequently delivered a female baby compared with those
who had a male baby was higher umbilical artery resistance
indices at 20 weeks'gestation in women who carried female
fetuses (Table 1).
Plasma Ang II levels were higher in women with female
fetuses compared with women carrying a male fetus (n =
68, p = 0.017), but Ang 1-7 levels were the same irrespec-
tive of fetal sex (Figure 1). Therefore, Ang 1-7 to Ang II
ratios were lower in women carrying female fetuses com-
pared to males (p = 0.016, Figure 1). The total concentra-
tion of Ang II plus Ang 1-7 was similar in both groups of
women, as were plasma ACE concentrations and prorenin
concentrations (Figure 2). At 15 weeks' gestation, maternal
heart rate, blood pressure, rate pressure product, plasma
urea, plasma sodium, plasma creatinine, urinary albumin to
creatinine ratio, urinary protein to creatinine ratio and the
urinary sodium to potassium ratio were not affected by fetal
sex (Table 1).
CRP concentrations were inversely related to maternal
prorenin concentrations (Figure 3), as was placental weight
if the fetus was male (Table 2). In women with female
fetuses, maternal prorenin concentrations at 15 weeks'

gestation positively correlated with umbilical artery resist-
ance indices at 20 weeks' gestation.
In contrast to the negative relationships between maternal
prorenin concentrations and CRP concentrations in women
with either a male or female fetus, there were positive rela-
tionships betweenAng II concentrations and CRP (Figure 3).
Significantly, there was a sexually determined difference in
the relationships between Ang II concentrations at 15 weeks'
gestation and birth weight. There was a positive relationship
between Ang II concentrations at 15 weeks' gestation and
male birth weights that was not seen if the fetus was female
(Table 2). There was also a positive correlation in women
carrying male fetuses, between Ang 1-7 and maternal heart
rate and plasma sodium concentrations.
Only one relationship between the limited measures of
renal health that we could obtain and the maternal RAS was
found. In women carrying female fetuses, plasma creati-
nine (a surrogate measure of GFR) was positively related to
plasma ACE concentrations (Table 2).
Discussion
The observations that Ang II concentrations are higher if
the fetus is female and Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios lower sup-
port our hypothesis that the balance between these RAS
peptides is influenced by the sex of the fetus. Our second
hypothesis was that any differences in the Ang II and Ang
1-7 axes of the RAS were associated with differences in

maternal prorenin or ACE levels. Since there were no dif-
ferences in prorenin or ACE levels between the two groups,
the higher Ang II concentrations in women with a female
fetus did not depend on parallel differences in those factors
that control its production, which we measured. There was
also no difference between the two groups of women in the
total concentration of Ang peptides measured. Taking these
two observations into account, the sex-specific differences
in maternalAng II concentrations and in theAng 1-7 toAng
II ratios in these women could be due to a greater rate of
conversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7 in women carrying a male
fetus. ACE2, which converts Ang II to Ang 1-7, is found in
abundance in the syncytiotrophoblast of both the early- and
late-gestation placenta,35­38 where it could convert maternal
Ang II, perfusing the intervillous space to Ang 1-7. Thus
the sex difference in the Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratio could be
conferred by exposure of maternal Ang II to male
syncytiotrophoblast.
Levels of Ang II and Ang 1-7 were measured in blood
collected in EDTA tubes. This was because they were col-
lected for a multicentre study looking for biomarkers of
pregnancy outcome. At the time of collection, peptides of
the RAS were not considered and so tubes containing pro-
tease inhibitors were not made available to the clinic. There
may have been some post-collection activity of proteases
not sensitive to EDTA. It is unlikely that either ACE or
ACE2 were active post-collection since both are inhibited
by EDTA39 and plasma ACE2 activity is blocked by an
endogenous inhibitor.40 Be that as it may, this does not
account for the striking sexual dimorphism in theAng 1-7 to
Ang II ratios. The greater amount of Ang II in women carry-
ing female fetuses and the lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios are
indicative of a lesser rate of conversion of Ang II to Ang 1-7
in these women. Adult males have higher circulating ACE2
activity than that of adult females41 and ACE2 activity is
higher in the kidney of male mice due to an increased
enzyme velocity.42 We suggest that if ACE2 in the syncytio-
trophoblast35­38 of women carrying male fetuses also exhib-
its the same higher enzyme velocity, Ang II would be more
rapidly converted to Ang 1-7 by the male placenta.
Our third hypothesis was that differences in circulating
RAS components would affect other measures of maternal
cardiovascular and renal health, as well as a marker of
inflammation (CRP; Table 2). Overall there were no sex-
specific differences in maternal cardiovascular function or
in indices of renal health at 15 weeks' gestation. Although
several sex-specific relationships between RAS compo-
nents and measures of cardiovascular and renal health were
found (Table 2), the sex-specific mechanisms behind these
relationships are unclear. While these are only associations
and require experimental validation, they may imply sex
differences later in gestation in women who develop gesta-
tional hypertension or preeclampsia.
Stark et al.43 found that near term, women carrying a
female fetus had lower peripheral microvascular skin
blood flow than women carrying a male fetus. We think
that the higher Ang II concentrations in women carrying a
female fetus and the consequent lower Ang 1-7 to Ang II
ratios could explain this difference in maternal skin blood
flow. Ang II is both directly and indirectly a potent vaso-
constrictor44 and Ang 1-7 a vasodilator,45 so the lower Ang
1-7 to Ang II ratios in women carrying a female fetus could
result in increased vascular tone. The study by Stark et al.43
also showed a greater increase in maternal peripheral
microvascular flow in response to corticotrophin-releasing
hormone (CRH) in women carrying male fetuses. This
might also be explained by our finding that Ang 1-7 to Ang
II ratios were higher in women carrying male fetuses
because both Ang 1-7 and CRH increase endothelial NO
production.26

If, as postulated above, ACE2 activity is greater in the
male fetus and in its placenta than the female, then this
could also explain the lower umbilical artery resistance
indices of male fetuses compared with female fetuses, since
ACE2 is also found in abundance in the fetal endothelium
of the villous placenta.35,38
In both groups of pregnant women, Ang II and CRP con-
centrations were directly related. CRP is a non-specific
marker of inflammation. Ang II is commonly regarded as a
pro-inflammatory peptide which has been shown to stimu-
late CRP synthesis in vascular endothelial cells,32 as well as
macrophages,33 and blockade of the Ang II-AT1
receptor is
associated with decreased plasma CRP concentrations.46
CRP is synthesised by the liver in response to factors
released from adipocytes and is known to be associated
with obesity.47 We cannot explain the negative correlation
seen in both groups of women between maternal prorenin
and CRP. Although it may occur indirectly through nega-
tive feedback effect of Ang II on renal prorenin production,
we found no evidence for a negative relationship between
prorenin and Ang II in maternal plasma in this study (data
not shown).
Finally, we postulated that differences in Ang peptides,
and therefore differences in the vasodilator/vasoconstrictor
balance, would be associated with altered uterine artery and
umbilical artery resistance indices as well as fetal growth.
Here we have shown that there is a positive relationship
between maternal Ang II levels and birth weight in women
carrying male fetuses but neither Ang peptide was related
to uterine or umbilical artery resistance indices in this con-
trol population. In contrast, a positive correlation between
maternal prorenin and umbilical artery resistance indices of
female fetuses and a negative correlation between maternal
prorenin and placental weight of male fetuses was observed,
suggesting that prorenin within the utero-placental circula-
tion has adverse effects on fetal health and well-being.
In conclusion, in healthy pregnancies with normal out-
comes, maternal plasma Ang II concentrations were higher
and Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios were lower at 15 weeks' gesta-
tion if women were carrying a female fetus. This could
account for the higher maternal peripheral vascular tone seen
at term in pregnancies carrying female fetuses compared to
those with males.43 There is no evidence that these differ-
ences are due to higher concentrations of prorenin or ACE. It
is possible that the rate of conversion ofAng II toAng 1-7 by
ACE2 is slower in women bearing female fetuses.
This work shows for the first time that early in normal
human pregnancy the concentration of two biologically sig-
nificant angiotensin peptides in the maternal circulation is
influenced by fetal sex. The higher Ang 1-7 to Ang II ratios
could explain findings by others that maternal microvascu-
lar skin flow is higher if a woman is carrying a male fetus,
as Ang 1-7 is a vasodilator and Ang II is a vasoconstrictor.
The higher umbilico-placental vascular resistance of female
fetuses and the negative impact of high maternal prorenin
levels on placental weight if the fetus is male further sug-
gest that the intrauterine RAS may influence placental
development and function.
This study also highlights the need to take into account
fetal sex when studying the role of the maternal circulating
RAS in pregnancy.
