Context: The contribution of reproductive hormones to
mood has been the focus of considerable research. Re-
sults from clinical and epidemiological studies have been
inconsistent. It remains unclear whether alterations in
serum hormone levels across the menopausal transition
are linked to depressive symptoms.
Objectives: To evaluate the relationship between se-
rum hormone levels and high depressive symptoms and
whether hormone levels or their change might explain
the association of menopausal status with depressive
symptoms previously reported in a national sample of
midlife women.
Design: Alongitudinal,community-based,multisitestudy
of menopause. Data were collected at baseline and annu-
ally from December 1995 to January 2008 on a range of
factors. Early follicular phase serum samples were as-
sayed for levels of estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone,
testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate.
Setting: Seven communities nationwide.
Participants: A community-based sample of 3302 mul-
tiethnic women, aged 42 to 52 years, still menstruating
and not using exogenous reproductive hormones.
Main Outcome Measure: Depressive symptoms as-
sessed with the Center for Epidemiological Studies De-
pression Scale (CES-D). The primary outcome was a
CES-D score of 16 or higher.
Results: In multivariable random-effects logistic regres-
sion models, log-transformed testosterone level was sig-
nificantly positively associated with higher odds of a
CES-D score of 16 or higher (odds ratio=1.15; 95% con-
fidence interval, 1.01-1.31) across 8 years, and a larger
increase in log-transformed testosterone from baseline
to each annual visit was significantly associated with in-
creased odds of a CES-D score of 16 or higher (odds ra-
tio=1.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.45). Less edu-
cation, being Hispanic, and vasomotor symptoms, stressful
life events, and low social support at each visit were each
independently associated with a CES-D score of 16 or
higher. No other hormones were associated with a CES-D
score of 16 or higher. Being perimenopausal or post-
menopausal compared with being premenopausal re-
mained significantly associated with a CES-D score of 16
or higher in all analyses.
Conclusions: Higher testosterone levels may contrib-
ute to higher depressive symptoms during the meno-
pausal transition. This association is independent of meno-
pausal status, which remains an independent predictor
of higher depressive symptoms.

THE CONTRIBUTION OF REPRO-
ductive hormones to mood
has been a focus of efforts to
explainsexdifferencesinde-
pression. Recent longitudi-
nalstudieshavefoundthatwomenaremore
susceptible to higher levels of depressed
mood during the menopausal transition
than just prior to it,1-3 reinforcing the need
to address the question about the role of re-
productive hormones in the development
of depression and negative mood.
Multiple theories have been proposed to
identify and explain the hormonal dynam-
ics that might be physiologically related to
depressed mood. These range from early
notionsthatthedecreasesinorultimatelow
levels of estradiol (E2
) induce depression
postmenopausally to the more recent hy-
pothesis that the unstable and irregular pat-
tern of hormone production during the
perimenopausal transition may increase
vulnerability to mood disorders in suscep-
tible women.4 Indeed, neurobiological data
have indicated that gonadal steroids are ca-
pable of influencing all aspects of neuro-
transmitter activity.4 Specific nuclear re-
ceptors for estrogen have been identified in

areas of the brain such as the pituitary and hypothala-
mus,5 and estrogens, progestins, and androgens affect a
wide range of neuromodulator processes, including the
neuromodulators serotonin and norepinephrine, impli-
cated in the development of depression.6,7
Yet, the numerous epidemiological and clinical stud-
ies that have examined associations between reproduc-
tive hormones and depression have yielded inconsis-
tent results, showing both a positive and a negative
association between depression and E2
or its variabil-
ity,2,8 follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),2,8 testoste-
rone (T),9,10 dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and DHEA
sulfate (DHEA-S).11,12 The net result of this literature is
the absence of a consistent or coherent hormonal expla-
nation for depression particularly during the meno-
pausal transition.
The research to date has also had methodological limi-
tations, including cross-sectional designs, small sample
sizes, primarily white participants, and, in the few lon-
gitudinal studies, limited periods of follow-up. The Study
of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a pro-
spective study of the menopausal transition, has fol-
lowed up a large, ethnically diverse sample for 8 years.
Thus, SWAN has addressed many of the previous stud-
ies' limitations. In the current analyses, we build on our
earlier findings from analyses of the first 5 annual as-
sessments in which we reported that high depressive
symptoms as measured by a standard questionnaire, the
CenterforEpidemiologicalStudiesDepressionScale(CES-
D), were more likely to be reported when midlife women
were perimenopausal and postmenopausal than when pre-
menopausal,1 independent of multiple psychosocial fac-
tors and vasomotor symptoms.
The overall aim of the current analyses was to exam-
ine the relationship between serum hormone levels and
high depressive symptoms. We evaluated the following:
(1) whether our previously reported findings were rep-
licated with 3 additional years of follow-up; (2) the con-
current relationships of depressive symptoms and se-
rum levels of the reproductive hormones (FSH, E2
, T, and
the somatic adrenal hormone DHEA-S) over 8 years; (3)
associations between changes in each hormone from base-
line and high depressive symptoms; and (4) whether the
hormones attenuated or nullified the association of meno-
pausal status defined by bleeding patterns with elevated
depressive symptoms.
METHODS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS
The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation is a longitu-
dinal, multiethnic, multisite, community-based study of meno-
pause and aging among 3302 premenopausal and early peri-
menopausal women.13 Eligibility for enrollment was assessed
between December 1995 and October 1997 with a screening
survey of health, reproductive, demographic, and lifestyle in-
formation. Of the 16 065 women screened, 3302 eligible women
were enrolled in the longitudinal cohort. Each of 7 sites re-
cruited white women and women from 1 specified minority
group (African American women in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
in Boston, Massachusetts, in the area of Detroit, Michigan, and
in Chicago, Illinois; Japanese women in Los Angeles, Califor-
nia; Chinese women in the region of Oakland, California; and
Hispanic women in Newark, New Jersey). Eligibility included
being aged between 42 and 52 years, having an intact uterus,
having at least 1 menstrual period and no use of exogenous re-
productive hormones in the previous 3 months, not being preg-
nant or lactating, and self-identification with 1 of the site's des-
ignated racial/ethnic groups. Study retention at the end of the
eighth follow-up visit was 74%, at which time two-thirds of the
participants (66%) were postmenopausal and 11% were late peri-
menopausal. The New Jersey site did not retain women be-
yond year 5 because of administrative reasons unrelated to the
purpose of the study. The institutional review boards at all par-
ticipating sites approved the study protocol. After excluding 2
women missing the CES-D data,14 1 woman missing covariate
data, and 3 women missing serum hormone levels at all ex-
aminations, our sample consisted of 3296 women.
PROCEDURES
The SWAN participants were assessed at study entry (base-
line) and once a year with a common standardized protocol.
All study forms and materials were available in English, Span-
ish, Japanese, and Cantonese and bilingual staff was used as
appropriate. Baseline and annual assessments included self- and
interviewer-administered questionnaires about health, life-
style, and psychosocial factors. Height and weight were mea-
sured using a common protocol, and a fasting blood sample
was obtained in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle
if possible. Participants provided signed, written informed con-
sent prior to study entry.
MEASURES
Assessment of Depressive Symptoms
Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and annually
with the CES-D Scale, a 20-item measure that asks about the
frequency of being bothered by depressive symptoms during
the previous week on a 4-point scale of 0 (rarely) to 3 (most or
all of the time).14 A score of 16 or higher is generally used to
identify potential clinical depression15 and was used to indi-
cate clinically relevant depressive symptoms in this study. The
CES-D has been shown to be valid and reliable in diverse eth-
nic populations.16-18 To examine more or less severe depres-
sive symptoms, we also compared 3 groups of women: those
with CES-D scores lower than 16, those with CES-D scores of
16 to lower than 22, and those with CES-D scores of 22 or higher
(the median of the group with CES-D scores of 16).
Serum Hormone Measurements
The fasting blood draw was targeted to days 2 to 5 of the fol-
licular phase of the menstrual cycle in menstruating women and
within 90 days of the anniversary of the baseline examination
date. If a timed sample could not be obtained after 2 attempts, a
random fasting sample was taken within a 90-day window of the
annual visit. Blood was refrigerated within 1 to 2 hours after phle-
botomy. All samples were maintained at 4°C until separated; fol-
lowing centrifugation, the serum was aliquotted, frozen at -80°C,
and shipped on dry ice to the central laboratory. All assays used
a double-antibody chemiluminescent immunoassay with a solid-
phase anti-IgG immunoglobulin conjugated to paramagnetic par-
ticles, antiligand antibody, and competitive ligand labeled with
dimethylacridinium ester.
The E2
assay modified the rabbit anti-E2-6

(FTI=[100Tinnanogramsperdeciliter]/[28.84SHBGinnano-

says were conducted at the SWAN Endocrine Laboratory, Uni-
versityofMichigan,AnnArbor,usingtheACS-180automatedana-
lyzer (Bayer Diagnostics Corp).
Menopausal Status
Menopausal status was based on menstrual bleeding patterns
in the previous 12 months and was categorized as the follow-
ing: (1) premenopausal (menstrual period in the past 3 months
with no change in regularity in the past 12 months); (2) early
perimenopausal (menstrual period in the past 3 months with
change in regularity over the previous 12 months); (3) late peri-
menopausal (no menstrual period within the past 3 months but
some menstrual bleeding within the past 12 months); and (4)
postmenopausal (no menstrual period within the past 12
months). The classifications are similar to those recom-
mended by the World Health Organization19 and the Stages of
Reproductive Aging Workshop.20 Based on SWAN eligibility
requirements, all women were premenopausal or early peri-
menopausal at baseline.
Covariates
Age, race/ethnicity, and education were obtained at the base-
line examination. The CES-D score and all other variables were
obtained at each annual examination. Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated as weight (obtained with a calibrated scale) in
kilograms divided by height (obtained with a stadiometer) in
meters squared. Smoking status was assessed as current vs not.
Women self-reported medication use for nerves or depression
at least twice per week in the month prior to interview; this
was verified by examination of medication containers in the
clinic by the interviewers or participants reading labels to the
interviewer over the telephone.
Vasomotor symptoms were coded as presence or absence
of hot flashes, cold sweats, or night sweats in the previous 2
weeks. Psychosocial variables included social support, 4 items
from the Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey (score
ranged from 0-16),21 and upsetting life events based on a check-
list of 18 life events since the last study visit rated according to
how upsetting they were (categorized as 0, 1, or 2 very up-
setting events).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For the longitudinal analyses, we excluded observations (ie, vis-
its) at which a woman reported using exogenous hormones,
being pregnant, or breastfeeding since the last study visit; we
censored data from women who reported surgical menopause
(bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy) at subsequent fol-
low-up visits; and we did not include observations with miss-
ing covariate data. Minimally adjusted models examining con-
current serum hormone levels from baseline through follow-up
visit 8 included 3296 women. Models examining change in hor-
mone levels at the follow-up visits included 2882 women. The
decrease in sample size came primarily from women who
dropped out after the initial visit (n=293). Women who dropped
out were more likely than those who enrolled to smoke, to have
depressive symptoms, lower education, and higher BMI, and
to be of Hispanic race/ethnicity and were less likely to be Chi-
nese or Japanese. These women did not differ on menopausal
status, age, or hormone levels at baseline.
Separate random-effects logistic regression analyses were con-
ducted to determine associations between CES-D scores of 16
or higher and concurrent serum hormone levels and change
in hormone levels through visit 8. We ran 3 sets of models: (1)
a replication of previously reported associations between meno-
pausal status and high depressive symptoms with 3 years of ad-
ditional data; (2) an analysis of concurrent hormones; and (3)
an analysis of change in hormones from baseline. Each set of
analyses consisted of a minimally adjusted model and a fully
adjusted model as described later. The inclusion of a (woman-
specific) random intercept quantifies the correlation between
all observations from a given woman to overall variation and
enables us to ascribe a woman-specific interpretation to model
parameters. Random-effects logistic regression models are rela-
tively robust to missing data and make use of all available data
across all visits. Natural logarithm transformation was used for
serum hormone concentrations to reduce skewness. To exam-
ine more or less severe depressive symptoms, separate models
were repeated comparing the middle CES-D score group (scores
16 and 22) and the highest CES-D score group (scores 22)
with the lowest CES-D score group (scores 16).
We modeled T and DHEA-S as a function of aging because
these hormones have been shown to decrease slowly with age
and show little effect of the menopausal transition itself.22 In
minimally adjusted models for each of the hormones predict-
ing high depressive symptoms, we included race/ethnicity, study
site, baseline age, and years since baseline (ie, aging). Al-
though E2
and FSH manifest a clear inflection at the time of
the final menstrual period, only 1272 women had observable
final menstrual periods. Thus, we conducted and report analy-
ses of E2
and FSH as a function of time. Results of these analy-
ses were similar to those from analyses modeling E2
and FSH
as a function of age at the final menstrual period. We also in-
cluded a quadratic term for each hormone to account for po-
tential nonlinear associations with depression scores across time.
None of these analyses yielded significant results, and they are
not discussed further.
Hormones showing significant associations with depressive
symptoms in a minimally adjusted model were assessed further
in analyses that included covariates. For the fully adjusted model,
we selected potential confounders and covariates based on the
literature and a priori hypotheses. Appropriateness of each vari-
able was evaluated individually and via model-building tech-

niques, including using a cutoff of P.05. Final models also in-
cluded baseline education and time-varying covariates of
vasomotor symptoms, medication use, BMI, social support, life
events,smoking,andmenopausalstatus.Whenexaminingchange
in hormone levels, the minimally and fully adjusted models in-
cluded baseline serum hormone values.
Because bleeding patterns became less predictable as women
progressed through the transition, it became increasingly dif-
ficult to anchor a serum sample to a phase of the menstrual pe-
riod. We previously found that the timing of the blood draw
can be considered a surrogate for the transition.23 Therefore,
given the larger portion of noncycling observations (ie, late peri-
menopausal and postmenopausal) over the 8 years and ob-
served links between status and depressive symptoms in SWAN,1
we included menopausal status (rather than cycle day) in mul-
tivariable analyses.
Additional analyses explored the association of the E2
-T ratio
with high CES-D scores and examined whether the relationship
between hormones and depressive symptoms differed for women
with certain characteristics, including low education, high finan-
cial strain, low social support, or very upsetting life events, using
interaction terms between significant serum hormone levels and
dichotomous variables of each characteristic. Neither the E2
-T ra-
tio nor any of the interactions were significant.
Analyses were run using SAS version 9.1 statistical soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and Stata ver-
sion 9 statistical software (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas).
P.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Participants are described in Table 1. At baseline, en-
dogenous hormone levels did not differ between women
with high CES-D scores (16) and those with low CES-D
scores (16). Women with depressive symptoms at base-
line were more likely to be African American or His-
panic, be current smokers, have a higher BMI, and be early
perimenopausal. Over the 8 years of follow-up, mean
log
FSH values increased and mean log
E2
values decreased,
whereas there were minimal changes in mean log
T and
mean log
DHEA-S values (Figure 1).
MENOPAUSAL STATUS AND
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
Consistent with the previously reported first 5 years of
follow-up, with an additional 3 years of follow-up, women
continued to have monotonically increasing odds of a
CES-D score of 16 or higher when they were early and
late perimenopausal and postmenopausal compared with
when they were premenopausal (adjusted models ex-
cluding hormone levels), with odds ratios (ORs) rang-
ing from 1.31 (early perimenopause) to 1.79 (postmeno-
pause) (P.001).

SERUM HORMONE LEVELS
AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
In the minimally adjusted random-effects logistic models,
no significant effects of log
E2
, log
FSH, log
DHEA-S, or log
free
E2
index were observed in odds of a high CES-D score
(Table 2). However, log
T and log
FTI each significantly in-
creased the odds of a high CES-D score by 19% and 11%,
respectively, for each 1-unit increase in the log-
transformed value of each hormone. In the fully adjusted
models, log
FTI was no longer significant, whereas log
T re-
mained significant (Table 3). In the fully adjusted analy-
ses of the 3 levels of CES-D scores, concurrent log
T was as-
sociatedwithanORof1.20(95%confidenceinterval,1.00-
1.44)forthegroupwiththehighestCES-Dscorescompared
with the group with low CES-D scores and was associated
with an OR of 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.25)
for the group with middle CES-D scores compared with
the group with low CES-D scores.
CHANGE IN SERUM HORMONE LEVELS
AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
In the minimally adjusted models, only change in levels
of log
T and log
FTI over time were significantly associated
with high CES-D scores (Table 2), while only change in
log
T remained significant in the fully adjusted analyses
(Table 4). Overall, about 75% of the observed differ-
ences in log
T over time were either decreases (-3.93 to
0.00 ng/dL) or very small increases (up to 0.16 ng/dL);
25% were increases (0.16 to 2.42 ng/dL). Results for the
change in log
T from baseline showed that women with high
depressive symptoms had smaller decreases or greater in-
creases in log
T from baseline. For ease of interpretation,
Figure 2 illustrates the relationship of quartiles of change
in all hormones with odds of a high CES-D score. It can
be seen that as the change in log
T positively increases, the
greater the odds of a high CES-D score become. In the
fully adjusted analyses of the 3 levels of CES-D scores,
change in log
T from baseline was associated with an OR
of 1.38 (95% confidence interval, 1.09-1.75) for the group
with the highest CES-D scores compared with the group
with low CES-D scores and was associated with an OR
of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.32) for the group

low CES-D scores.
Finally, in all analyses, the odds of high depressive
symptoms were significantly greater when women were
perimenopausalandpostmenopausalthanwhentheywere
premenopausal (Table 3 and Table 4).
COVARIATES AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS
Associations among the covariates and between each co-
variate and log
T were small (r0.16). Although associa-
tions were significant, the covariates reduced the effect
of log
T by only a small amount (concurrent log
T: OR=1.19
in the minimally adjusted model; OR=1.15 in the fully
adjusted model). Of note, in models of both concurrent
log
T and change in log
T over time, covariates including up-
setting life events, lower education, and vasomotor symp-
toms showed strong associations with high depressive
symptoms. Social support had a protective effect, being
associated with lower odds of having high depressive
symptoms (Table 3 and Table 4).
COMMENT
In this study, we assessed whether reproductive hor-
mones were related to risk of high depressive symptoms
(CES-D score 16) over 8 years of follow-up and whether
they might explain the previously observed association
between menopausal status and these symptoms in the
early years of SWAN.1 Although we found no signifi-
cant effect of the level of or change in E2
or FSH on risk
of depressive symptoms, we did find that higher current
total testosterone levels and an increase in testosterone
levels from baseline were significantly associated with high
CES-D scores whether defined as a score of 16 or greater
or 22 or greater. This association was independent of mul-
tiple covariates and confounders and, most important,
of menopausal status and vasomotor symptoms. Impor-
tantly, perimenopause and postmenopause continued to
be significantly independently associated with odds of
high depressive symptoms.
Neuroendocrine theories suggest that estrogens in par-
ticular have a role in the development of depression in
women as they may modulate the activity of the seroto-
nin neurotransmitter system that has been linked to de-
pression.24,25 At one time, the biological link between
menopause and mood was hypothesized to be that low
levels of estrogen were associated with negative mood.
However, epidemiological studies of menopause have
shown either no relationship between negative mood
symptoms and menopausal status26-28 or higher levels of
symptoms during perimenopause29-33 and not during post-
menopause when estrogen levels are low. Although sev-
eral short-term randomized controlled trials have shown
efficacy of exogenous estrogen in attenuating depres-
sion in perimenopausal women,34,35 no studies demon-
strate direct associations between depression and se-
rum E2
levels.8,9,36
More recently, it has been postulated that the fluctu-
ating and irregular pattern of E2
and FSH secretion oc-
curring during the menopausal transition37,38 may con-
fer neuroendocrine susceptibility to depression in
vulnerable women.36 However, by its very nature, the
changing hormonal milieu during the transitional years
is difficult to measure adequately. Two studies have sup-
ported this hypothesis.2,39 Freeman et al2 found that over
8 years of follow-up of 231 premenopausal women with-
out high depressive symptoms at baseline, average vari-
ability in the means of FSH and E2
levels was signifi-
cantly positively associated with odds of high depressive
symptoms. Ryan et al39 reported that among postmeno-
pausal women, declines in serum E2
levels and large in-
creases in FSH levels over 2 years were associated with
increased odds of high depressive symptoms, but abso-
lute hormone levels were not. These studies included only
select periods of the menopausal transition, including pre-
menopause and early perimenopause in the study by Free-
man and colleagues and postmenopause in the study by
Ryan and colleagues. Neither study encompassed the en-
tire menopausal transition through postmenopause. The
use of 2 annual blood draws 1 month apart by Freeman
et al2 may have increased the ability to detect effects of
hormones during the transition. In the postmenopausal
cohort,39 serum hormone levels of E2
and FSH are more
stable than are those obtained in perimenopausal wom-
en; thus, the hormone measures may be more reliably
informative.

Animal and clinical studies indicate that androgens,
which are produced in women directly or indirectly
from peripheral conversion of precursors from the
adrenal glands and the ovaries, influence mood and
behavior--particularly aggressive and sexual behav-
ior.24,40 The literature indicating that DHEA and
DHEA-S may modulate mood has yielded contradictory
findings; depressive symptoms have been positively12
and negatively11,41,42 correlated with these androgen
precursors.
Although T in women has typically been studied in
the context of sexual behavior, the cross-sectional and
longitudinal studies that have considered the associa-
tion between T and mood have reported mixed re-
sults.8-10,42-45 In the Seattle Midlife Women's Health Study,
urinary T collected repeatedly over 10 years was not as-
sociated with high depressive symptoms, nor were any
otherreproductivehormones.8,43 Similarnullfindingswere
reported for serum T in a group of midlife women in Bal-
timore, Maryland,9 and Victoria, Australia,46 and in a group
of women aged 49 to 65 years participating in the Afri-
can American Health project in St Louis, Missouri.42 A
study of a large sample of elderly women reported an in-
verse association between free T levels and depressive
symptoms.47 Several studies found an improvement in
mood and well-being with the use of exogenous T, but
these produced supraphysiological levels.48-50
Studiesofselectsamplesoffemales,includingearlyado-
lescents,45 women with severe premenstrual symptoms,51
peripartal women,52 those with major depression,10,53 and
women with polycystic ovary syndrome,54,55 have re-
ported findings similar to ours. Two small clinical trials re-
ported a significant positive relationship between log
T and
major depression in women compared with age-matched
controls.10,53 Eriksson et al51 in Sweden found that serum
levels of T were significantly higher at 3 points during the
menstrual cycle in 11 women with severe premenstrual ir-
ritability and dysphoria than in age-matched controls with-
outmenstrualsymptoms.Inastudyof193pregnantwomen
at term, serum log
T levels were significantly correlated with
depression scores prepartum and on the first and second
postpartum days (r=0.15-0.18).52 Among a representa-
tive sample of 369 girls aged 9 to 13 years residing in west-
ern North Carolina, mean levels of log
T were highly signifi-
cantly associated with major depression. Finally, among
women with polycystic ovary syndrome, a common en-
docrine disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism, log
T
and depression were positively associated.55

of T and mood associations may be explained in part by

the heterogeneity of the samples and designs. Further,
the positive associations between log
T and depression have
been reported largely in select samples during periods
of reproductive hormone fluctuations and extreme ex-
cursions as exemplified by puberty, by peripartum, and
premenstrually or among women with an endocrine dis-
order, suggesting that the hormonal milieu at these times
may alter the dynamics of the relationship between T and
depressive symptoms in vulnerable women.
In women, the adrenal glands and the ovaries are the
main sources of circulating T, derived either directly from
these organs or indirectly through the peripheral con-
version of androstenedione.22,56 Testosterone is also aro-
matized to estradiol and, similar to E2
, T increases den-
sity of serotonin receptors in the brain.40 If this were the
mechanism by which T influences mood, we would ex-
pect to find an inverse association between T and mood.
On the other hand, perhaps the relative androgenicity of
the hormonal milieu as women move through the meno-
pausal transition influences neurotransmission and dis-
rupts mood. However, we found no significant effects of
a higher level of serum T relative to E2
(E2
-T ratio) or
change in this ratio on depressive symptoms, which may
be owing to the limitations of annual serum samples to
adequately measure the variability in E2
levels during the
menopausal transition. As noted later, T is not subject
to the same variability.
Noteworthy is that although we observed a significant
association of log
T with depressive symptoms, this was sub-
stantially smaller than those between other independent
variables and symptoms, including menopausal status.
Importantly,upsettinglifeeventsincreasedtheoddsofhigh
depressive symptoms by 2.5- to 5-fold, and high social sup-
port decreased the odds by one-fifth.
The study had several limitations. Serum samples were
collected annually, which underrepresents the variabil-
ity of E2
and FSH levels and limits the capturing of the
dynamic nature of the changes in these hormones dur-
ing the early menopausal transition and the increasing
menstrual irregularity of late perimenopause. This is some-
what less of a problem for the measurement of T be-
cause it changes more slowly with age and is not subject
to the variability that E2
and FSH levels are during the
menopausal transition.22,57 Commercially available T as-
says have limitations.58 Therefore, SWAN used a modi-
fied immunoassay that extends the low limit of detec-
tion and was cross validated with mass spectrometry.
Another limitation was that the CES-D is a measure of
depressivesymptoms,notmajordepression.Additionally,
some studies in primary care settings show that the cut-
off score of 16 or higher is also a useful screen for general
anxietyandpanicdisorders59,60 andthattheCES-Dishighly
correlated with anxiety measures such as the Beck Anxi-
etyInventory(r=0.68),59 suggestingthattheCES-Disnot
specificfordepression.However,ouranalysesusingahigher
CES-Dcutoffscore(22)showedresultsconsistentwith
those identified with the cutoff score of 16 or higher.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first lon-
gitudinal study of serum hormones, particularly T, and
depressive symptoms to be conducted in a large and di-
verse sample of midlife women traversing the meno-
pausal transition. The results are independent of mul-
tiple relevant and confounding covariates, including BMI
and the presence of vasomotor symptoms. Notably, the
association between menopausal status and high depres-
sive symptoms remained strong and consistently inde-
pendent of any of the specific hormones. Along with the
modest association between T and high depressive symp-
toms, this suggests that high depressive symptoms dur-
ing the menopausal transition are unlikely to be due only
to levels of or marked changes in the reproductive hor-
mone environment during this period.
