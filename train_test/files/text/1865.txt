ESRD incidence is much lower in Europe compared with the United States. This study investigated whether this reflects a
difference in the prevalence of earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) or other mechanisms. CKD prevalence in
Norway was estimated from the population-based Health Survey of Nord-Trondelag County (HUNT II), which included
65,181 adults in 1995 through 1997 (participation rate 70.4%). Data were analyzed using the same methods as two US National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys in 1988 through 1994 (n  15,488) and 1999 through 2000 (n  4101). The primary
analysis used gender-specific cutoffs in estimating persistent albuminuria for CKD stages 1 and 2. ESRD rates and other
relevant data were extracted from national registries. Total CKD prevalence in Norway was 10.2% (SE 0.5): CKD stage 1 (GFR
>90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and albuminuria), 2.7% (SE 0.3); stage 2 (GFR 60 to 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and albuminuria), 3.2% (SE
0.4); stage 3 (GFR 30 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2), 4.2% (SE 0.1); and stage 4 (GFR 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2), 0.2% (SE 0.01).
This closely approximates reported US CKD prevalence (11.0% in 1988 through 1994 and 11.7% in 1999 through 2000). The
relative risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRD in US white patients compared with Norwegian patients was 2.5.
This was only modestly modified by adjustment for age, gender, and diabetes. Age and GFR at start of dialysis were similar,
hypertension and cardiovascular mortality in the populations were comparable, but US white patients were referred later to
a nephrologist and had higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. In conclusion, CKD prevalence in Norway was similar to
that in the United States, suggesting that lower progression to ESRD rather than a smaller pool of individuals at risk accounts
for the lower incidence of ESRD in Norway.

There has been a dramatic rise in the number of patients
with ESRD in both Europe and North America during
the past decades. There is significant disparity, how-
ever, in ESRD incidence rates between the two continents:
Incidence rates are three times higher in the United States
compared with Norway and Great Britain (1,2). Data on the
prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Europe are
limited, making it unclear whether the higher ESRD incidence
in the United States reflects a higher burden of all stages of
CKD (3,4).
The relationship between the prevalence of earlier stages of
CKD and the incidence of ESRD is complex (5­9): US CKD
prevalence has been relatively stable in the past decade,
whereas ESRD incidence has increased significantly, and US
black patients have a three times higher incidence of ESRD
despite similar prevalences of CKD. This can be due to differ-
ences in other mechanisms, such as more rapid progression or
greater initiation of dialysis. Early stages of CKD also result in
a higher risk for complications, cardiovascular disease, and
mortality, which pose a larger absolute risk than ESRD. Fur-
thermore, identifying and treating individuals with early stages
of CKD is increasingly proposed for prevention of ESRD and
cardiovascular disease (9,10). This requires solid documenta-
tion of a high prevalence of preclinical disease. Thus far, Euro-
pean studies on CKD prevalence have been hampered by se-
lection bias or incomplete data for defining CKD stages (11­13).
Therefore, there is a need for more information on the prev-
alence of CKD in European populations as well as a better
understanding of the relationship of CKD prevalence to ESRD
incidence. The second Health Survey of Nord-Trondelag
County (HUNT II) is a large, population-based, cross-sectional
study that was conducted in central Norway with a high par-
ticipation rate (14). We used HUNT II data to assess the prev-
alence of CKD using calibrated serum creatinine values and
repeated measurements of albuminuria. Combining these prev-
alence estimates with available information on ESRD, health

care, and population characteristics, we also examined the ex-
tent to which the low incidence of ESRD in Norway compared
with the United States reflects a difference in the earlier stages
of CKD between the two countries.
Materials and Methods
During August 1995 through July 1997, a large-scale general health
survey was conducted in Nord-Trondelag County, Norway (HUNT II).
Every individual who was 20 years or older and residing in the county
(n  92,939) was invited, and 70.4% of this total adult population
participated. The survey comprised an extensive questionnaire and a
brief clinical examination, including analysis of serum creatinine in all
participants and urine albumin in a subgroup. The population in Nord-
Trondelag is stable (net out migration of 0.3% per year) and ethnically
homogeneous (97% white). Nord-Trondelag County is located in cen-
tral Norway, and it is representative regarding geography, economy,
industry, morbidity, and total and cardiovascular mortality (15). The
age and gender distribution of Nord-Trondelag County is identical to
Norway, but the participation rate in HUNT II was strongly age de-
pendent. Participation rate was highest in the age group 60 to 69 yr
(86%) and declined toward 50% in the youngest as well as the oldest
age groups (14). A more detailed description on objectives, contents,
and methods (including reasons for nonparticipation) in HUNT II has
been given elsewhere (14). All participants signed an informed consent,
and additional permissions were obtained from the Regional Ethics
Review Committee and the National Data Inspectorate.
Data Collected
The participants self-reported health status, family history, socioeco-
nomic status, and medication use. The clinical examination included
measurement of height, weight, and BP. Three consecutive standard-
ized BP measurements were recorded in the sitting position using an
automatic oscillometric method (Dinamap 845XT; Criticon, Tampa, FL).
Participants were classified as hypertensive when the mean of the two
last measurements was 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic or
when they reported taking antihypertensive medication (16). Partici-
pants were classified as having diabetes when they reported having
diabetes ("sugar disease") or when they were found to have venous
plasma glucose 200 mg/dl (11.2 mmol/L) 2 h or more after the last
meal (17).
Laboratory Investigations
Blood was drawn, often in the nonfasting state, from all participants,
and fresh serum and urine samples were analyzed within 2 d at the
Central Laboratory of Levanger Hospital on a Hitachi 911 Autoanalyzer
(Mito, Japan). Glucose was measured by means of an enzymatic hex-
okinase method, cholesterol by an enzymatic calorimetric cholesteroles-
terase method, and serum creatinine by a kinetic Jaffe method with
water blank using reagents from Roche (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim,
Germany). Day-to-day coefficients of variation were 1 to 2% for all
analyses. There was no drift in mean serum creatinine over time when
the entire population was examined (0.001 mg/dl per month [0.1
mol/L]). Local serum creatinine cutoffs for abnormality (97.5th per-
centile) were 1.30 mg/dl (115 mol/L) for women and 1.50 mg/dl (133
mol/L) for men.
A 5% random sample of the total population was included for
screening of albuminuria. Participants delivered urine samples for
analysis on three consecutive mornings, and those who reported urine
infection during the previous week or menstruation at time of collec-
tion were excluded. Urine albumin was measured by an immunotur-
bidimetric method (anti-human serum albumin; Dako AS, Glostrup,
Denmark), and urine creatinine was measured with the Jaffe
´ method.
The albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) was used as an expression for
urine albumin excretion. We used similar cutoffs as in previous analysis
of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) study (18): Participants with two or three ACR determi-
nations that ranged from 17 to 250 mg/g (1.9 to 28.3 mg/mmol) for men
and 25 to 355 mg/g (2.8 to 40.2 mg/mmol) for women were classified
as having persistent microalbuminuria, and participants with one or
more samples above the microalbuminuric range were classified as
having macroalbuminuria.
GFR Estimation
GFR was estimated with the new re-expressed four-variable Modifi-
cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula for isotope dilution
mass spectrometry (IDMS) traceable serum creatinine values: GFR 
175  (serum creatinine)1.154 age0.203 ( 0.742 if female) (1.21 if
black) (19). The Jaffe method used for analyzing HUNT II samples in
1995 through 1997 was switched to an enzymatic creatinine test (CREA
Plus; Roche Diagnostics) in 2003. Two hundred samples from the
HUNT II study were thawed and reanalyzed to ensure stability of the
Jaffe method over time (mean difference 0.018 mg/dl [1.6 mol/L]; r2
 0.994), and a recalibration of the Jaffe assay in HUNT II to the
enzymatic method was established: Serum creatinine (mg/dl, enzy-
matic)  0.31  1.11  serum creatinine (mg/dl, Jaffe). This enzy-
matic method was the same as used for recalibrating the original
MDRD creatinine values to the IDMS level (19), and the method also
was found to be comparable to the IDMS level in the Nordic Reference
Interval Project (20). The resulting GFR estimates also were found to be
unbiased at all ages in the general population (21).
To unmask analytical bias in our comparisons of the HUNT II and
NHANES III studies, we also compared estimated GFR (eGFR) in a
subgroup of healthy, low-risk participants in HUNT II with a corre-
sponding group in NHANES III. Participants who were included ful-
filled the criteria that would make them eligible for kidney donation:
No hypertension, no diabetes, no macroalbuminuria, good or excellent
general health, and a normal serum creatinine. For all age groups (10
yr), mean GFR differed by 0 to 3 ml/min per 1.73 m2, indicating
minimal calibration bias between the two studies. Additional analyses
were performed with the original four-variable MDRD formula (22)
with an indirect recalibration of our creatinine values to the same level
as used when developing the MDRD formula (23). This indicated a 3-
to 7-ml/min per 1.73 m2 difference between the two studies; we there-
fore used the new MDRD formula for analysis unless otherwise stated.
Statistical Analyses
Stage 1 CKD was defined as an eGFR 90 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and
either macroalbuminuria or persistent microalbuminuria. Stage 2 CKD
was eGFR 60 to 89 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and either macroalbuminuria or
persistent microalbuminuria. Stages 3 through 5 CKD were classified
according to the level of kidney function (eGFR 30 to 59, 15 to 29, and
15 ml/min per 1.73 m2, respectively), regardless of the presence of
other markers of kidney damage (9). Participants with stage 5 CKD
were excluded because of the small number of participants, and non-
participation rates caused by related illness would be expected to be
particularly high, biasing downward these prevalence estimates. Mi-
croalbuminuria was defined using gender-specific cutoffs in the pri-
mary analysis with additional results presented for non­gender-spe-
cific cutoffs.
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 12.0.1 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize vari-
ables, to calculate prevalence estimates, and for stratification of the
2276 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology J Am Soc Nephrol 17: 2275­2284, 2006
HUNT II data. When odds ratios (OR) in various strata were homoge-
neous, the Mantel-Haenszel common OR estimate was used. A logistic
regression model for prevalence of CKD stages 3 to 4 was fitted to the
data to predict prevalence in various subgroups. Linearity in age was
checked, and significant interactions were accounted for by using sep-
arate models.
HUNT prevalence estimates were age and gender standardized by the
direct method to the Norway 1996 or US 1991 populations as appropriate
(24). US prevalence estimates were obtained from the published literature
(6,25), with the exception of some subgroup analyses that were obtained
directly from the authors (J.C. and B.C.A., personal communication, Feb-
ruary 2005). An ecologic estimate for risk for progression from CKD stages
3 or 4 to ESRD was calculated by dividing the annual ESRD incidence rate
among individuals who were older than 20 yr by the number of patients
who had CKD and were at risk.
Results
Participants in HUNT II had a mean age of 50.2 yr, and 10.0%
were 75 yr or older. They were characterized by the following
renal and cardiovascular risk factors: The prevalence of diabe-
tes was 3.4%; BP was 140 systolic or 90 diastolic in 44.4%,
and 11.0% were on antihypertensive medication; 33% reported
daily smoking; the mean cholesterol level was 5.9 mmol/L; 8%
reported having angina pectoris, previous myocardial infarc-
tion, or previous stroke; obesity, defined as body mass index
(BMI) 30 kg/m2, was present in 15.9%, and morbid obesity
(BMI  40) was found in 0.7%. Serum creatinine was analyzed
in 65,181 (99.4%) participants. Values above normal levels (1.30
mg/dl [115 mol/L] for women and 1.50 mg/dl [133 mol/L]
for men) were found in 0.1% of participants at ages 20 to 39 yr,
0.5% at ages 40 to 59, 2.1% at ages 60 to 69, and 6.2% at ages 70
yr.
Table 1 presents the prevalence of normal and decreased kidney
function in the HUNT II study by demographics and clinical
characteristics. The prevalence of mildly decreased (eGFR 60 to 89
ml/min per 1.73 m2), moderately decreased (eGFR 30 to 59
ml/min per 1.73 m2), and severely decreased kidney function
(eGFR 15 to 29 ml/min per 1.73 m2) were 38.6, 4.5, and 0.2%,
respectively (45.1, 4.7, and 0.2% using the original four-variable
equation). Older age was very strongly associated with decreased
kidney function: The prevalence of eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
was 50 to 100 times higher in the oldest compared with the
youngest group. Hypertensive individuals had five-fold higher
prevalence compared with nonhypertensive individuals, but
adjustment for age reduced the OR to 1.5 (95% confidence
interval [CI] 1.3 to 1.6). Similarly, individuals with diabetes had
1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) higher odds for CKD than individuals
without diabetes after adjustment for age. Gender-specific preva-
lence was only slightly confounded by age, with an adjusted OR
in women compared with men of 1.5 (95% CI 1.4 to 1.6).
Table 2 gives the prevalence of CKD in the HUNT II study as
based on the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative clas-
sification system. CKD stages 1 and 2 require macroalbumin-
uria or persistent microalbuminuria as well as normal (90
ml/min per 1.73 m2) or only mildly decreased eGFR (60 to 89
ml/min per 1.73 m2), respectively. Albuminuria was measured
at three visits in a randomly selected subgroup (n  3270), with
a 77.2% response rate, whose characteristics were similar to the

other individuals (gender, age, diabetes, hypertension, cardio-
vascular disease, cholesterol, smoking, BMI, eGFR; P  0.45 for
all comparisons). Persistence was defined as the presence of
albuminuria in two or more urine samples, and its prevalence
at each eGFR range was applied to the proportion of individ-
uals with eGFR in that range. The overall prevalence of CKD
stages 1 through 4 was 11.2% (11.5% using the old four-variable
MDRD formula with indirect recalibration of creatinine values).
The prevalence for CKD stages 3 and 4 by age, gender, hyper-
tension, and diabetes was estimated using stratified logistic
regression models. The prevalence was equal to 1/[1 
exp(Logit)], where Logit  11.01  0.117  age (0.71 if
diabetes present) for nonhypertensive men; Logit  9.079 
0.095  age (0.302 if diabetes present) for hypertensive men;
Logit  8.728  0.091  age (0.678 if diabetes present) for
nonhypertensive women; and Logit  8.048  0.087  age
(0.262 if diabetes present) for hypertensive women. For ex-
ample, the group of 75-yr-old nonhypertensive women with
diabetes will have Logit  8.728  0.091  75  0.678 
1.23 and an estimated prevalence for CKD stages 3 through
4  1/{1  exp[(1.23)]}  22.7%.
Table 3 compares prevalence of CKD in Norway with that in
the United States. After age and gender standardization of the
HUNT II data to the Norwegian 1996 population, national
prevalence of CKD stages 1 through 4 was 10.2% in Norway
(95% CI 9.2 to 11.2). After age standardization to the US 1991
population, the prevalence was a little lower at 9.3%, still close
to US white prevalence of 11.0%. As reported previously, the
US prevalence of CKD stages 1 through 4 remained relatively
stable from 1988 to 1994 through 1999 to 2000 and was not very
different in black and white individuals. Because of the smaller
sample size, the 1999 to 2000 estimates are not race stratified,
and detailed comparisons of ESRD to CKD incidence in white
individuals are made using the 1988 to 1994 data.

Figure 1 shows that the incidence of ESRD increased from
1984 to 2002 in both countries but was much lower in Norway
at all times. The incidence rate ratio for US white individuals to
Norwegians increased from 2.1 in 1988 to 2.9 in 2000. Table 4
gives the risk for progression from CKD stages 3 or 4 to ESRD
for adult US white individuals and Norwegians stratified by
age, gender, and diabetes status. The risk for progression in
general was higher for US white individuals than for Norwe-
gians. Every year, there are 61 new ESRD patients in the United
States and 24 in Norway for each 10,000 patients with CKD
stages 3 to 4. Adjusting for age, gender, and diabetes only
modestly affected the increased risk in US white individuals.
US white patients without diabetes had 2.0 times higher risk for
reaching ESRD, and the relative risk was 2.8, even higher,
among patients with diabetes.
Table 5 shows characteristics of incident patients who started
ESRD treatment in Norway and the United States. Incidence
rates of ESRD that was caused by diabetes and hypertension
were much lower in Norway compared with US white patients,
whereas the incidence of ESRD that was not related to these
factors was similar. Mean eGFR at start of ESRD treatment was
equal, and similar proportions of older patients and those with
disabilities were included. Norwegians were referred earlier to
a nephrologist, and more had an adequate number of predialy-
sis visits. More Norwegian patients were treated with erythro-
poietin, and they started dialysis with higher hemoglobin and
albumin levels. More Norwegian patients had a kidney trans-
plant as their first treatment, and more patients had an arterio-
venous fistula as their first access. Data regarding economy and
general population characteristics of importance for the inci-
dence of ESRD are given in Table 6. Income per capita were
similar in the two countries, but significant differences in the
proportion living in poverty and without health insurance or
lacking functional literacy skills were present. Diabetes and
obesity were much more prevalent in the United States,
whereas the proportion of people who were on antihyperten-
sive treatment was similar. Mortality rates from ischemic heart
disease, one of the leading causes of death in the general
population and among patients with CKD and ESRD, were
similar.
Discussion
This large, population-based study found the overall CKD
prevalence to be 10.2% in Norway, close to the prevalence in
the United States, with similar estimates even for severe CKD
(eGFR 15 to 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2). This is at odds with a three
times lower incidence of ESRD in Norway than in US white
patients. Stratification by race, gender, age, hypertension, and
diabetes indicates that within each of these factors, the preva-
lence of CKD is similar between the two countries, whereas the
risk for ESRD among individuals with CKD is markedly higher
in the United States than in Norway. The ESRD to CKD ratio
was nearly two-fold higher in the United States than in Norway
at age 60 yr and three-fold higher at older ages. These eco-
logic data, although subject to bias, indicate that the higher risk
for ESRD in the United States compared with Norway is not
due to a markedly higher prevalence of CKD but a higher rate
of progression from CKD to treated ESRD.
The risk for starting ESRD treatment is a combination of
surviving competing causes of death, reaching kidney failure,
being offered renal replacement therapy, and accepting this
therapy. This study cannot dissect the relative contributions of
these factors, but national data are informative in considering
these aspects. Overall cardiovascular mortality, the leading
cause of death in both countries, is similar, and life expectancy
in Norway is higher than that in the United States, suggesting
that competing mortality may not be a large factor. Kidney
disease progression itself and the role of comorbidity and ac-
cess to treatment are more difficult to assess. The lower prev-
alence of diabetes in Norway can explain some of the lower
progression to ESRD. However, even among patients with
diabetes, US white patients had a much higher risk for progres-
sion to ESRD. Hypertension, the second established risk factor
for progression, was equally prevalent in the two countries.
Another difference that could affect progression was the strik-
ing difference in obesity; 4.0% of white participants in the
NHANES 1999 Survey were morbidly obese (BMI  40 kg/m2)
compared with only 0.7% of HUNT II participants. Obesity is
known to lead to ESRD through diabetes and hypertension, but
emerging experimental evidence also indicates that obesity can
contribute directly to kidney damage, through a cascade of
additional hemodynamic, metabolic, and inflammatory mech-
anisms as well as by mechanical compression (26­29). Obesity
thereby can be an important exacerbating factor, at least in
patients with preexisting nephropathy or reduced renal mass.
Ratios of ESRD to CKD in this article are based on ecologic
rather than individual follow-up data, limiting inferences about
risk factors for progression.
Pre-ESRD care is increasingly recognized as important for
reducing ESRD mortality and, at least equally important, in
Figure 1. Annual incidence of ESRD (per million inhabitants) in
Norway and the United States.

slowing progression of CKD and development of ESRD (30,31).
The quality of pre-ESRD care has been reported to be subopti-
mal in the United States (32,33), and several key markers of
predialysis care in our study indicate differences between the
two countries. Norwegian patients with CKD were referred
earlier to a nephrologist and had more pre-ESRD visits. As a
result, more patients received erythropoietin treatment, and
they had a higher hemoglobin level when starting dialysis
treatment compared with US white patients. Such treatment is
increasingly recognized as potentially important for reducing
the progressive loss of remaining nephrons (34­37). Norwegian
patients also had higher serum albumin levels, indicating better
nutritional status (38).
The lower incidence rate of ESRD in Norway could be due to
different acceptance criteria and different indications for start-
ing dialysis and transplantation. Acceptance criteria have be-
come broad in Norway, as in most other Western countries. The
mean age at start of renal replacement therapy was identical for
Norwegians and US white patients and so was the proportion
of patients with disabilities. The eGFR level at the start of
treatment was similar in the two countries, suggesting similar
timing of the start of dialysis. All health services, including
predialysis treatment as well as ESRD treatment, are free in
Norway. An active transplantation program has managed to
keep the pool of dialysis patients small; 73.1% of prevalent
ESRD patients receive a transplant, median time on the waiting
list is 10 mo, and only 15% have waited 2 yr (39). The
available data do not suggest large differences in treatment
availability, but quantification of treatment access is difficult.
For example, we are not aware of data to allow for comparison
of the proportion of patients who reach kidney failure but do
not start long-term dialysis.
The situation for US white versus Norwegians patients are
somewhat analogous to US black versus US white patients.
Black Americans experience a three times higher incidence of
ESRD compared with white Americans despite similar preva-
lence of CKD stages 3 to 4. Hsu et al. (8) concluded that this
probably is due to different rates of progression. A higher
prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, and other conventional
risk factors as well as lower socioeconomic status explain part
but not all of the difference (40). To eliminate the effect of true
racial differences, we focused on comparing Norwegians with
US white patients.
Our international comparison has a number of limitations.
The MDRD formula is known to perform well in patients with
CKD and low GFR, but its use in populations with higher GFR

aPrevalence (per 100,000 adults) of CKD stages 3 to 4 is from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III; 1988 to 1994, which is not significantly different from NHANES 1999 to 2000) and from HUNT II (1995 to
1997). Incidence of ESRD (per 100,000 adults per year) is from the US Renal Data System (USRDS; 1995 to 1997) and from the
Norwegian Renal Registry (1995 to 1997). Data on patients with diabetes represent CKD or ESRD in patients with diabetes as
primary renal diagnosis or as a secondary complicating diagnosis (25,39,44­46).
2280 Journal of the American Society of Nephrology J Am Soc Nephrol 17: 2275­2284, 2006
has shown varying results (41­43). Errors in eGFR are caused
partly by calibration differences between the creatinine assay in
the study and in the laboratory where the GFR equation was
developed. This possible problem was addressed in both the
HUNT and the NHANES analyses (23,25), and the new MDRD
formula that was used in our analysis seems unbiased in the
Norwegian population and at all ages (21). Imprecision in eGFR
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 is not critical, because classification
into CKD stages 1 to 2 depends on the presence of proteinuria.
Finally, methodologic limitations of the MDRD equation likely
would apply similarly to the US and Norwegian populations.
Although albuminuria was not measured in all participants in
HUNT II, ACR was measured in multiple urine samples in a
large random subsample. Both HUNT II and NHANES en-
rolled a large, representative sample of the general population,
with high rates of participation and completion rates, suggest-
ing that the similar prevalence rates of CKD represent true
similarities.
Conclusion
We found a high prevalence of CKD (10.2%) in a European
general population, close to the US prevalence (11.5%). There-
fore, the much lower incidence of ESRD in Norway compared
with US white patients is not explained by a lower prevalence
of the earlier stages of the disease. National data from Norway
and the United States show no large differences in competing
mortality, treatment availability, or timing of the start of dial-
ysis. The difference in risk for ESRD remains large after ac-
counting for the lower prevalence of diabetes in Norway com-
pared with the United States. The effects of a lower prevalence
of obesity as well as earlier referral to a nephrologist before the
start of dialysis and national health care system could not be
quantified. In conclusion, the large difference in ESRD rates
between Norway and the United States lies in the management
and fate of patients with existing CKD in these two populations
rather than the prevalence of CKD.
