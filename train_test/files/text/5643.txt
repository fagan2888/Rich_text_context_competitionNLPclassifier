ABSTRACT
Horrnesis is a dose-response phenomenon that has received little recognition,
credibility and acceptance as evidenced by its absence from major toxicological/risk
assessment texts, governmental regulatory dose-response modeling for risk assess-
ment, and non-visibility in major professional toxicological society national meet-
ings. This paper traces the historical evolution of the horrnetic dose-response hy-
pothesis, why this model is not only credible but also more common than the widely
accepted threshold model in direct comparative evaluation, and how the toxicologi-
cal community made a critical error in rejecting horrnesis, a rejection sustained over
70 years.

INTRODUCTION
The central pillar of toxicology is that of the dose-response relationship. The na-
ture ofthe dose response has long been assumed to follow a threshold model (Bliss,
1935a, 1935b, 1935c; Clarke, 1937; Finney, 1952; Gaddum, 1953). This has been
especially the situation for non-carcinogens. In the case of carcinogens, regulatory
agencies such as the EPA and FDA have assumed that the shape ofthe dose response

is linear at low doses based principally on a conservative precautionary-type philos-
ophy. Advocates for either a threshold or linear model perspective have engaged in
a long-term debate over the biological plausibility of their respective models, espe-
cially in the contentious area of carcinogen risk assessment/regulation. While the
threshold vs linearity at low-close debate has cast a dominant shadow over the field
of risk assessment for nearly three decades, in this paper we propose that the most
fundamental shape of the dose-response relationship is neither threshold nor linear
but U-shaped. This challenge for the primacy of dose-response model dominance
in toxicology and, in fact, the vast array of biological disciplines by the U-shaped
perspective cuts to the core beliefs of the field with extremely significant evolution-
ary, ecological, biomedical, clinical, economic and social implications (Calabrese
and Baldwin, 2001a). The present paper will establish that the hormetic dose re-
sponse is the most dominant dose-response model in toxicology based on objective,
head-to-head comparison with the threshold model; it will demonstrate how the
toxicological community missed this basic feature of the dose response, a mistake
of historical proportions and implications; it will also provide a mechanistic frame-
work that can account for quantitative features of the hormetic dose response. This
evaluation will be placed within an historical context to enhance a balanced under-
standing of the unfolding of toxicological thought concerning the dose-response
throughout the past century. The paper argues that the hormetic dose response is
the central dose-response model in toxicology and needs to be included in all lead-
ing texts and taught as a routine feature of toxicological instruction dealing with the
dose response and principles of risk assessment.
DEFINITION
The U-shaped dose response model is commonly referred to as hormesis, a dose
response phenomenon characterized by a low-dose stimulation and a high dose
inhibition. This dose response may take the shape of either the inverted U or a
j-shaped dose response depending on the endpoint that is measured (Figure 1).
In the case of the inverted U-shaped dose response, this may be observed when
endpoints such as growth, fecundity and longevity are measured. In the case of
j-shaped dose response relationships, this may be observed when endpoints such as
disease incidence are measured.
While the hormetic dose response is often described as either an inverted U- or
j-shaped dose response, it is best described as a dose-time-response, in which there
is an initial disruption of homeostasis (i.e., toxicity) followed by a modest overcom-
pensation response which eventually leads to a re-establishment of homeostasis. It
is this modest overcompensation response which is seen as the hormetic low-dose
stimulation (Figure 2) (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2001c, 2002a).
mSTORICAL PERSPECTIVES
The phenomenon of hormesis has had a long, but spotty history. For the most
part it has been a marginalized dose-response theory with occasional vocal advocates

over the past century. Once toxicology became a reasonably well organized and
professional discipline this dose-response theory found itself excluded from the
principal textbooks, developments of professional societies and the activities of an
ever dominant governmental toxicological/risk assessment influence. Despite this
shunned perspective by the dominant influences in the field of toxicology over the
past 70 to 80 years, there has been a continuous flow of articles published that
provides support to this hypothesis across the broad spectrum of biological sub-
disciplines.
The term hormesis entered the scientific literature in 1943 when Southam and
Ehrlich reported that extracts from the red cedar tree enhanced the metabolism of
fungi at low concentrations but inhibited it at higher concentrations. These inves-
tigators were apparently unaware of a substantial body of literature that described
similar dose responses in plants, microorganisms, insects, and mammalian models
from a variety of chemical agents, including most of the well-studied inorganic con-
taminants as well as various forms ofradioactivity (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2000a-e).
The primacy of the concept of hormesis is generally credited to Hugo Schulz, a
pharmacologist at the University of Greifswald in northern Germany who based ex-
periments dealing with the effects of disinfectants on the metabolism of yeasts in
the mid 1880s (Schulz, 1887). The terminology that grew up around the concept of
hormesis reflected the culture of the time, which had a tendency to name phenom-
ena after their discoverers and to quickly conclude that they reflected some type of

biological "Law." Thus, the initial observations of Schulz along' with his attempts to
generalize the concept resulted in this phenomenon being called the Arndt-Schulz
Law or Hueppe's Rule, after the bacteriologist who extended the findings to bac-
teria (Hueppe, 1896). However, these terms are rarely used today, giving way to
hormesis or other terms such as U- orj-shaped, biphasic dose response, dual effects,
bidirectional responses and several others.
The early history of what are now called hormetic effects was surprisingly im-
pressive. This phenomenon attracted a number ofwell-known researchers who pub-
lished their findings in the leading journals of the day. A detailed assessment of
the historical foundations of chemical and radiation hormesis has been published
by Calabrese and Baldwin (2000a-e). Even more impressive was the fact that sev-
eral of the early leading hormetic researchers were direct descendants from Nobel
Prize winners' laboratories such as Ferdinand Hueppe (see Hueppe, 1896) from
Robert Koch's lab, Louis Kahlenberg (University ofWisconsin) (see Kahlenberg and
True, 1896a,b) from Willhem Ostwald's lab, and Charles Richet (1905, 1906-1907), a
Nobel Prize winner for the discovery ofanaphylaxsis. Other early leaders in hormetic
research with outstanding scientific reputations were Charles Edward Winslow (see
Winslow and Dolloff, 1928; Winslow and Haywood, 1931; Falk, 1923) atYale Univer-
sity, Benjamin Duggar (1901, 1936) of Cornell University/University of Wisconsin,
andJensen (1907) at Stanford University. Due to the fact that X-rays and radionu-
elides were discovered about a decade after the initial research of Schulz, the
322 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol.1, No.3, 2003
Hormesis as Dose-Response Model
association of radioactivity and hormesis was delayed relative to chemical findings.
Nonetheless, substantial evidence emerged by the early 1920s that radiation-induced
biphasic dose-response relationships were considered common, reproducible and
independent of biological model (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2000c-d). In fact, the
hormetic dose response wascommonly reported and diagrammed in leading texts on
botany and microbiology into the middle decades of the twentieth century (Marshall
and Hrenoff, 1937).
Despite the initial decades of successful hormetic research it became the object
of opponents who successfully linked it with the medical practice of homeopathy
(Clark, 1937). This was an easy thing to do since the creator of the concept of
hormesis, Hugo Schulz, was a very strong proponent of homeopathy and in fact
interpreted his findings as providing the scientific foundations of the medical prac-
tice ofhomeopathy. In fact, the Arndt-Schulz Law was named, in part, after Rudolph
Arndt, a homeopathic physician. As a result ofthe very close association between the
Arndt-Schulz Law and homeopathy it became targeted by enemies ofhomeopathy in
the long-running confrontation with what is today called traditional medicine. Even
today, the proponents of homeopathy still point to the work of Schulz as providing
important historical foundations of the biological basis of homeopathy (Bellevite
et al., 1997). However, in the early decades of the twentieth century the homeopa-
thy movement had major setbacks with numerous homeopathic medical schools in
the U.S. being forced to close due to poor academic standards. How these actions
affected the Arndt-Schulz Lawhas never been studied but it is likely that it negatively
impacted its general recognition and acceptance. In fact, as early as 1896 Hueppe
argued that the findings of Schulz were reproducible and needed to be judged on
their own merits, not coupled with homeopathy, even though this was how Schulz
himself framed the question.
The downfall of the Arndt-Schulz Law,however, cannot be solely laid at the feet of
its close association with homeopathy. It had a number ofotherlimitations ofnotable
importance that combined to make this theory play scientific catch-up throughout
the remainder of the century. For example, the proponents of the Arndt-Schultz
Law attempted to transform this dose-response theory into a range of profitable
businesses, claiming, for example, that low doses of radium could be used not only
as a human elixir but also as a fertilizer for plants at low doses. In both cases it
had major public relations failures. In the case of the elixir, its greatest proponent,
Eben Evers, died a very public and painful death from radium-induced bone cancer.
In the case of radium as a fertilizer, the findings were consistently equivocal; most
notably was the 1948 13-site USDA study although it had important study design
weaknesses (Alexander, 1950). In addition, the emphasis on the nature of the dose
response during the 1920s and 1930s was not on low-dose effects; in fact, just the
opposite. Issues that received greatest attention were the effects of disinfectants on
microbes, the effects ofpesticides on a wide range oforganisms, as well as protection
ofworkers from toxic substances. These cases involved instances ofhigh-dose effects.
Furthermore, it was evident that the investigations of that era did not address the

quantitative features of the hormetic dose response, which in fact are rather modest,
at least as far as the low-dose stimulation is concerned.
By the 1930s, the collective criticisms of the Arndt-Schulz Law had significantly
eroded many of the earlier gains it had made in both the chemical and radiation do-
mains. Despite the legitimacy of many of these criticisms, this was unfortunate since
the data underlying the hormetic hypothesis were generally sound and substantial.
However, as is common in such debates, commercial claims were often proven wrong
while scientific limitations were often exaggerated. This fall from centrality within
the scientific community during the early 1930s and subsequent decades occurred
as major consolidations were taking place in the U.S. and elsewhere with respect to
health and safety issues, statistical foundations of dose-response relationships and
governmental decisions of how to estimate risks from radiological and chemical
hazards. At this point, tlle Arndt-Schulz Law became generally ignored and has con-
tinued to be so.
This brief assessment of the historical foundations ofhormesis reveals that it was
a theory without either a financial sponsor or a core of leading scientific propo-
nents, In addition, U.S. science in the twentieth century became one that was nearly
entirely dependent upon government agency funding and responsive to its intellec-
tual agenda, often supported by influential bodies such as the National Academy of
Sciences. Lacking tllese crucial elements, hormesis was an hypothesis that failed to
thrive.
NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND INTEREST
Major developments in environmental regulation over the past 40 years have
provided the necessary incentive for the reexamination of the hormesis hypothesis.
While this may not seem obvious, it is directly linked to the extraordinary conservative
protectionist philosophy of governmental agencies such as the U.S. EPA in their
risk-assessment procedures for carcinogens, which assume linearity at low doses.
Such governmental actions have led to very high costs being imposed on affected
industries and organizations such as the U.S. DOD and DOE. This led to interest
not only in exploring the biological foundations of low-dose extrapolation but also
alternative models of low-dose responses. It became very evident to those leading
the affected organizations that if hormesis was right then linearity at low doses was
wrong. At that point, the 1981 book by Luckey dealing with hormesis and ionizing
radiation became potentiallysignificant. Ironically, Luckey did not even mention any
relationship between hormesis and carcinogenicity. Nonetheless, it sparked interest
in the concept of radiation hormesis, especially in light of reports in the 1950s and
1960s suggesting that low doses of radiation may reduce the risks of certain cancers
in natural high background radiation settings (Luckey, 1991), as well as reports
suggesting enhanced longevity in survivors of the atomic bomb blast (Kondo, 1993)
and numerous animal model validation experiments during the 1970s and 1980s
(see Calabrese and Baldwin, 2002b for review).

Hormesis as Dose-Response Model
This combination of factors and the leadership of the Electric Power Research
Institute (EPRI) led to the first-ever conference on Radiation Hormesis in1985 in
Oakland, California. Of particular note was that the proceedings were published
two years later in the prestigious journal Health Physics, adding not only enhanced
visibility to the topic but that elusive credibility that hormesis lacked. Several years
later, Leonard Sagan (1989), who directed the 1985 EPRI conference, and Sheldon
Wolff (1989) of the University of California at San Francisco debated the viability
ofhormesis as a credible biological hypothesis in the journal Science. Following the
publication of the Science articles a meeting was held in May 1990 at the University of
Massachusetts, Amherst to devise a plan to provide balanced leadership for assessing
how biological systems respond to low levels ofchemical and physical stressors. Based
on this meeting, the BELLE (Biological Effects ofLow Level Exposures) organization
was created that has played a significant role in assessing the hormesis concept (see
commentary by Rodricks, 2003).
OBJECTIVE EVALUATION
By the mid-1990s the assessment ofhormesis seemed to fall into groups that either
thought it was a concept based on reproducible data or were unconvinced, generally
concluding that the low-dose stimulation was most likely that of normal variation.
These critics contended that the evidence in support ofthe hormesis hypothesis had
simply been overinterpreted.
In order to move beyond this impasse concerning hormesis, we developed a priori
evaluative criteria to assess whether a dose-response displayed features consistent
with the hormetic/biphasic dose-response. These criteriawere based on study design
characteristics, such as whether the experiment displayed a NOAEL (No Observed
Adverse Effect Level) and the number ofdoses less than the NOAEL, the magnitude
ofthe low-dose stimulation, the presence or absence ofstatistical significance for the
stimulatory effects, and the reproducibility of the findings. Each factor considered
received a numerical ranking, which provided a basis for a mathematical algorithm
to estimate the likelihood that each dose-response yielded evidence consistent with
the hormetic hypothesis. We also developed a relational retrieval database into which
information from numerous different content fields from each study could be en-
tered. With these two tools, evidence from about 5000 experiments was accumulated
that provided positive evidence of hormesis. An assessment of the findings indicates
that hormetic dose-response relationships are very generalizable, being indepen-
dent of biological model, endpoint measured and chemical class/physical stressor
(Calabrese and Baldwin, 1997; Calabrese et al., 1999). Figure 3 provides a diverse
set of examples of dose-response relationships that are consistent with the hormetic
hypothesis. They were selected to demonstrate the range of biological models and
endpoints in which hormetic responses may occur.
The creation of this hormesis database using objective criteria was an impor-
tant first step in the assessment of hormesis as a credible biological hypothesis. Of

importance was that the evaluative criteria were sufficiently specific and objective
that they led to negligible variation among those evaluating dose responses for the
presence or absence of evidence concerning hormesis. It was this type of consis-
tency that was sought in order to overcome the disparity of the conclusions that
proponents and opponents had expressed on the topic.
An assessment of this database revealed important characteristics of hormetic
dose-response relationships. Most notably, the magnitude ofthe low-dose stimulation
was generally quite modest. In most cases the maximum stimulation did not exceed
two-fold greater than the concurrent control group. The maximum response was
generally about 30-60% greater than the control group response. The width of the
stimulatory response was more variable than that of the magnitude of the low-dose
stimulation. Typically the range of the stimulatory responses was within a factor of
10-20 of the NOAEL dosage. In a small proportion of the cases the dosage range of
the stimulation would exceed a factor of 100-fold. In addition, there were occasions
when the stimulatory dosage range would reproducibly exceed 1000-fold.
Ofimportance was that the hormetic stimulation was graphically contiguous with
and ended at the traditional toxicological NOAEL (Figure 4). This allowed risk
assessors the opportunity to place hormetic responses within a risk assessment dose-
response context. This would prove to be the case not only for testing purposes
within a hazard assessment framework but also for modeling oflow-dose responses.
The second reason is that the hormetic response was closely linked to the occur-
rence of the initiation of toxicity. In fact, since 1896 (Townsend, 1896) the low-dose
stimulation had been reported to occur as a result of an overcompensation to a
disruption in homeostasis. In fact, this observation, which has been repeatedly re-
ported (Calabrese, 2001), provides the foundation for why the hormetic response is
invariably adjacent to the toxicological NOAEL.

That hormesis may occur as a result of an overcompensation to low-level toxic
insult accounts for why the stimulation is modest, based on the assumption that
the disrupted biological process/system will re-establish homeostasis. Under such
circumstances it would be expected that the biological processes would use suffi-
cient resources to ensure that homeostasis is achieved within an appropriate time
period but not to be wasteful of resources. This would result in a predicted modest
"overshoot" phenomenon, which is what is typically observed with many hormetic
dose-time responses.
The quantitative characteristics of the hormetic dose response are therefore con-
sistent with expected features of a dose time response relationship in which there
is an initial toxic response. The principal difference in responses between the low
and high doses is that the low-dose toxicity becomes fully compensated and, in
fact, modestly overcompensated, resulting in the apparent "stimulation." However,
the high-dose toxicity remains unable to fully recover from the extensive damage
and displays the so-called high-dose "inhibition." Thus, when viewed at the appro-
priate time in the dose-time response, the hormetic-like biphasic dose response is
observed. However, if the dose-time response is seen at an earlier stage of respon-
siveness, then the dose response could appear as a traditional dose-dependent toxic
response (Figure 2).
This initial assessment ofhormetic responses not onlyyielded evidence to support
the existence of hormesis but it also provided valuable toxicological insights. These
findings permitted an evaluation of the generalizability of hormesis as well as pro-
viding a quantitative description of its dose-response features that were consistent
with a plausible toxicological model of dose-time responsiveness. In fact, now it be-
came clear why hormesis was hard to prove, challenging to replicate and a source of
contention among those who had long debated its existence. The key for studying
hormesis was to be found in the quality of the study design, such as the number
and spacing of doses below the NOAEL, a definitively characterized NOAEL, and
the inclusion of a temporal component that could capture the initial disruption in
homeostasis followed by the modest overcompensation response. Likewise, it was
critical to select an appropriate biological endpoint in which the control group had
an adequate background response. For example, selection of a tumor type with an
animal strain in which the control group had a negligible background incidence
would preclude the assessment of hormesis.
Despite the advances offered by the database-facilitated assessment of hormesis,
it did not permit an evaluation of the frequency of hormesis in the toxicological
literature. That is, while numerous, in fact thousands, ofexamples ofdose-responses
consistent with the hormetic hypothesis existed, this information offered no quan-
titative insight concerning the frequency of hormetic responses in the toxicolog-
ical literature. That is, did hormetic effects occur in 1% or 50% of toxicological
studies, or someplace in between? This was an important issue to resolve for reg-
ulatory agencies. If a response was real, but a relatively rare phenomenon, then it
could be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. If, on the other hand, it was commonly
336 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.3, 2003
Hormesis as Dose-ResponseModel
seen, then it would have to be considered as part of the "rule" and dealt with
accordingly.
To address the question offrequency, an entirely new database was created which
had apriorientry as well as apriorievaluative criteria (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2001a).
These new criteria were applied to essentially every article (i.e., 21,000) published in
three toxicologically orientedjournals (i.e., EnvironmentalPollution, Bulletin ofEnvi-
ronmental Contamination and Toxicology andLife Sciences) from their creation (i.e., mid
1960s)to the present. Thesejournalswere selected because they included the spec-
trum of ecologically to pharmacologically oriented toxicology. This was important
in order to address issues related to generalizability by model, endpoint and agent.
The data revealed that a priorientry criteria [i.e., a dose-response was required to
have a LOAEL (Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level), NOAEL, at least two doses
less than the NOAEL dose and a concurrent control] were satisfied in only about
2% of the articles assessed. However, of dose responses satisfying the entry criteria
approximately 40% satisfied a priorievaluative criteria, that is, the functional defini-
tion of hormesis (e.g., evidence of statistically significant responses for dosages less
than the NOAEL dosage).
The findings were important in several ways. For the first time there was an es-
timate of the frequency of hormesis in the broad toxicological literature. This fre-
quency revealed that hormetic responses were not rare occurrences and exceptions
but were commonly reported. Second, the very low proportion of studies that satis-
fied the a priorientry criteria indicated that the vast majority of toxicological studies
has been incapable of assessing whether hormesis existed or not. These studies, for
the most part, lack an adequate number of doses in the low-dose area and could not
therefore discern whether there was a reliable low-dose stimulation or not.
This insight was important because it provided a cogent explanation for how tox-
icologists could readily dismiss hormesis. The data indicate that 98% of toxicology
studies cannot address the hormesis hypothesis in an adequate evaluative fashion.
Only about 50% of the 2% of dose-responses that could assess the hormetic hy-
pothesis actually observed it. Consequently, only one out of every 100 published
dose-response relationships assessed displayed hormesis. In effect, this type of nu-
merical framework further emphasized the marginalized perspective within which
the hormetic hypothesis has been held.f
While this assessment addressed the issue ofhormetic effect frequency in the tox-
icologicalliterature, the second hormesis database (i.e., frequency database) also
provided a vehicle to determine which toxicological dose-response model may be
more frequent in the toxicological literature: the hormetic or the threshold model.
The threshold model assumes that there is no treatment-related effect for doses
Note that the criteria could have been even more stringent if temporal study design
criteria were also included. In fact, the lack of measurement at multiple time points in
most experiments satisfying the a priori criteria is a likely contributor to the reason why
only 40% of the experiments satisfied the definition of hormesis.

below the NOAEL, a type ofquasi-toxicological threshold dose. This further implied
that responses of doses below the NOAEL dose would be expected to vary randomly
on either side of the control value. For example, in our frequency database of about
650 dose responses that satisfied a priorientry criteria, there were nearly 1,800 col-
lective doses below the NOAEL. The threshold model predicts that there should
be a similar number of responses above and below the control value. "When this
was evaluated, the ratio was not 1:1 as predicted by the threshold model but 2.5:1,
a value highly consistent with the hormetic model. Further, the mean response of
the nearly 1,800 responses of doses below the NOAEL was 115%, a value consistent
with past observations ofhormetic responses (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a). These
findings indicated that the responses of doses below the toxicological NOAEL were
not randomly distributed butwere non-randomly distributed in a manner suggestive
ofhormesis.
Not only did these findings refute the perspective ofhormesis being a "paradox-
ical" phenomenon, it also suggested that the long-held beliefin the primacy of the
threshold model may have been misplaced. This conclusion is of obvious general
significance since acceptance of the hormetic model would irifer profound changes
in how studies are designed, biological models and endpoints selected, and risk
assessments performed.
The data also provided a framework to account for how the toxicological com-
munity, especially mammalian toxicologists, could have missed the hormetic dose-
response model and incorrectlyconcluded that the mostfundamental dose-response
model was the threshold model. This conclusion is supported by several consistent
observations. First, the NOAEL responses for about 70% of mammalian studies in
the frequency hormesis database were less than the control values. Even though
these NOAEL responses were not, by definition, statistically significantly lower than
the NOAEL, it is likely that a substantial proportion may have had a low level of
toxicity, even ifnot discernable at the P < 0.05 level. Second, in dose responses that
did not satisfy the functional definition of hormesis, where the NOAEL was S95%
of the control, the next lower dose adjacent to the NOAEL had a response that was
typically less than the control. At progressively lower doses from the NOAEL dose
the responses resembled more hormetic responses (i.e., responses greater than the
control) (Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a). This finding suggests that the majority of
mammalian toxicological studies have NOAEL values less than the control, many
probably have some degree of toxicity, and that toxicity may also be likely in the
first dose below the NOAEL; this makes the phenomenon of hormesis difficult, if
not impossible, to observe in such circumstances. Since most mammalian toxicology
studies rarely have more tllan one dose below the NOAEL it follows that the logical,
but incorrect, conclusion is that the most likely dose-response model would be the
threshold model. As a result of this rather limited/incomplete study design-based
perspective, the "collective" field of toxicology drew the wrong conclusion about the
nature of the dose response in the low dose zone. In fact, it is our contention that
simple limitation in the study design, which was focused on high-dose effects, led
338 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.3, 2003
Hormesis as Dose-Response Model
to the apparently "logical" conclusion that hormesis was wrong and threshold was
right, when in fact the full range ofdata are consistent with the opposite conclusion.
Despite these arguments in favor of the hormetic perspective, there has been
one overriding criticism that toxicologists skeptical of hormesis consistently raise.
That is, it is necessary to determine the mechanism(s) by which hormesis occurs.
Unless the issue of mechanism can be resolved acceptance of hormesis would be
seen as incomplete. A key limitation in the quest for the hormetic mechanism is
that the overwhelming majority of papers published on toxicological mechanisms
do not address the underlying explanations of transformations or switches in the
dose-response relationships from stimulation to inhibition. However, this question is
typically addressed in the sub-discipline ofmolecular pharmacology. Our assessment
of this literature has revealed that hormetic-like biphasic dose-response relationships
occurred with seemingly comparable frequency in the pharmacology and toxicology
domains. However, pharmacologists have both interest in switching mechanisms
and the molecular tools to assess such changes. We have determined that hormetic-
like biphasic dose response relationships have been reported in at least 30 receptor
systems (Table 1) for which a highly credible molecular explanation has been offered
at least to the level of receptor and often at levels of greater complexity (Calabrese
and Baldwin, 2001b).
These findings reveal that hormetic responses may occur as a result of numerous
mechanisms, depending on the cell type. There was clearly no single toxicological
mechanism. However, there appears to be a common biological regulatory strategy
that results in the achievement oflimited biological goals (e.g., smooth muscle con-
traction/relaxation, regulation of neutrophil migration, cell proliferation enhance-
ment or not) within the context of resource conservation while re-establishing and
maintaining homeostasis.

Over the past seven years, therefore, we have been able to demonstrate that:
1) hormesis is widespread in the toxicological literature; 2) that it has consistent
quantitative features of the dose response; 3) it is highly generalizable according
to model, endpoint and chemical class; 4) it has a frequency in the toxicological
literature that is approximately 40% using very rigorous objective criteria; 5) in
head-to-head competition with the threshold model the hormetic model clearly
outperforms it; 6) it has numerous underlying specific mechanisms. These findings
challenge the most basic pillar of the toxicological community concerning what
model best describes how biological systems responded to low levels of chemical
and physical stressor agents. The data also challenge how toxicological studies are
designed. That is, experiments with inadequate numbers of doses and dose spacing,
which also lack a temporal component, are not going to be able to address the issue
of hormesis. This is where the vast majority of toxicological studies reside.
HOW CAN HORMESIS BE USED?
The concept of hormesis changes how we think about toxicology and risk assess-
ment. In the domain ofhazard assessment; hormesis argues that there are meaning-
ful biological effects below the toxicological NOAEL. Over the past several decades
toxicologists and regulatory agencies have been content to derive NOAELs based
on the assumption that there were no treatment-related effects below the NOAEL.
If this can no longer be assumed, then it challenges researchers and regulat.ory
agencies to rethink their study designs and perhaps the biological models used and
endpoints measured.
The acceptance of hormesis as a default assumption in the risk assessment pro-
cess is one that should be taken seriously. This is because of the overwhelming
amount of data supporting it, especially those findings relating to its frequency in
the toxicological literature, its dominance over the threshold model, its widespread
generalizability and the fact that it is difficult to study unless adequate resources and
time are allocated. To require that hormesis be proven for every case would place a
substantial burden of both resources and time and for all practical considerations
would limit the application of hormetic phenomenon when, in fact, the evidence
argues that it is a general phenomenon.
The area of carcinogen risk assessment is likely to yield the biggest impact of
hormesis. The most obvious implication of the hormetic model is not that low doses
of carcinogens may actually reduce cancer risk, but that thresholds for carcinogens
exist. Even though hormesis was shown above to outperform the threshold model,
it may be ironically used to support the conclusion that thresholds exist for carcino-
gens. Unless hormesis can be demonstrated it is quite evident that thresholds for
carcinogens will be nearly impossible to prove, as has been the case over the past
two decades.
While the focus of this paper is environmentally oriented, it is important not
to ignore that the hormetic dose-response is quite common in pharmacology and
other biological fields concernedwith dose-response relationships. Numerous drugs,
340 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.3, 2003
Hormesis as Dose-Response Model
including antibiotics, anti-viral agents, anti-tumor agents and other chemotherapeu-
tic, as well as most peptides (see Calabrese and Baldwin, 2003a,b for their review),
often display hermetic-like biphasic dose responses. Similar dose responses are seen
for plant root exudates (Reigosa et al., 1999) and how they affect germination of
fungal spores and the growth of plant systems in soil. Biphasic responses are quite
common in the field ofexercise science especially with respect to immune responses
(Nieman, 2000). The hormetic dose response is therefore one that is most likely ba-
sic to all biological disciplines, the implications of which have only recently begun
to be specifically explored (Calabrese, 2000).
