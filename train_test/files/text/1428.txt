Abstract
Objectives: This study examined dietary intakes and nutritional status of marijuana
users and non-current marijuana users in US adults aged 20 to 59 years.
Methods: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III), 1988±1994. Information on self-reported drug use, including
marijuana, was obtained as part of the NHANES III physical examination component.
Nutritional status was assessed using height and weight, and blood biochemistries.
Dietary intake was assessed using a 24-hour recall and a food-frequency
questionnaire.
Results: Among adults 20±59 years of age, 45% reported ever having used marijuana
in their lifetime. A total of 8.7% reported using marijuana in the past month. Current
marijuana users had higher intakes of energy and nutrients than non-current
marijuana users; however, body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower. We found
higher cigarette-smoking rates and higher consumption of sodas and alcohol,
specifically beer, among marijuana users than among non-current marijuana users.
Marijuana users also consumed more sodium, fewer fruits, and more pork, cheese,
and salty snacks. Nutritional status, using indicators of serum nutrients, serum
albumin, haematocrit and haemoglobin, was similar between marijuana users and
non-current marijuana users. Serum carotenoid levels were lower among marijuana
users, independent of cigarette smoking.
Conclusion: Dietary intake was different among marijuana users than among non-
current marijuana users. Although overall nutritional status was similar, serum
carotenoid levels were lower in marijuana users. The long-term health effects of
these differences in marijuana users deserve careful consideration in future research.

Nutritional status
Marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the
USA. Approximately one-third of the US population aged
12 years or older, or 72 million persons, have reported
smoking marijuana at some point in their life1. Trends in
marijuana use have not changed dramatically since 19911.
The National College Health Risk Behavior Survey found
that 59.6% of students aged 25 years and older reported
ever having used marijuana, with 8.3% reporting being
current users of marijuana2.
In response to public pressure to allow for the medical
use of marijuana, the Office of National Drug Control
Policy of the United States evaluated the scientific
evidence for the benefits and risks of using marijuana as
a medicine3. We know little about the long-term effects of
marijuana use on the human body and other concomitant
health behaviours associated with marijuana consumption.
The report called for an increase in research to evaluate
the health consequences of marijuana use and other
behaviours associated with consumption of marijuana. It
is important that we learn more about the changes in
dietary habits that accompany marijuana use and their
beneficial or detrimental effect in the development of
chronic diseases later in life.
Use of psychoactive drugs, including marijuana, has
been reported to affect food and beverage consumption,
and body weight4±8. Mendelson studied chronic mari-
juana users in a laboratory setting and found that the
participants increased caloric intake and gained weight
during periods of active marijuana use5. Similarly, after
administering marijuana to 12 healthy volunteers, Hollis-
ter found total food intake, and reports of hunger and
appetite, to increase6. Foltin et al. also showed that

marijuana users increased their caloric intake and that this
increase was mostly due to increases in between-meal
snack items7. In a random double-blind study of eight
subjects, Zwillich et al. showed that the metabolic rate
was increased 15 to 120 min after marijuana administra-
tion8.
Most of these studies have focused on the immediate
effect of marijuana use. Limited information is available
about the intake of marijuana users in the free-living
population. We examined dietary intake and related
factors in the non-institutionalised US adult population
among those reporting using marijuana and those not
currently using marijuana.
Methods
Study population
The study population consists of participants of the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988±
1994 (NHANES III). The study design is described in detail
in the Plan and Operation of the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey9. NHANES III uses a
highly stratified multistage probability design and
employs over-sampling of the elderly, non-Hispanic
blacks and Mexican±Americans.
We limit this analysis to adults defined as aged 20 and
above. Additionally, only participants up to age 60 years
were asked about marijuana use. Our analytic sample
thus consists of those participants aged 20±59 years. A
sample of 14,883 persons 20±59 years old was selected
and asked to complete an extensive in-home interview
and a health examination at the mobile examination
centre (MEC). A total of 12,229 (82% of the sample
persons) were interviewed, and 11,271 (76% of the
sample persons) were examined. The total analytic
sample, excluding incomplete and unreliable dietary
recalls and incomplete marijuana data, is 10,623 adults,
which is 94% of those participants who were examined
and 71% of the total persons sampled.
The household interview generally took place one to
three weeks prior to the MEC health examination. Data on
marijuana use were collected during the health examina-
tion. Non-current marijuana users included never users
n  5843 and those who reported ever having used
marijuana, but who had not used marijuana in the past
month n  3928X Initial analysis showed these two
groups to be similar in social characteristics (e.g. age and
education) and dietary intake, and therefore they were
combined n  9771X We classified participants who
reported using marijuana in the past month (number of
days in the past month) by frequency of use: less than or
equal to four days per month n  541Y five to 10 days
per month n  135Y and 11 or more days per month
n  176X For the purpose of this paper, we shall refer to
these groups as light, moderate and heavy users,
respectively.
Dietary intake assessment
One 24-hour dietary recall was collected during the visit
to the MEC. The dietary interviewers used the Dietary
Data Collection system, which is an automated, standar-
dised, interactive dietary interview and coding system.
The system was specifically developed for NHANES III by
the University of Minnesota Nutrition Coordinating
Center. Participants were asked to report all foods and
beverages consumed, excluding plain drinking water,
during the previous 24 hours, from midnight to midnight.
During the household interview, a food-frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) with a one month reference period
was administered by an interviewer. The FFQ did not
include information on serving size and is not designed to
provide quantitative nutrient data. It does provide informa-
tion on the frequency of consumption of specific foods or
food groupings, such as frequency of beer use or frequency
of the use of salty snacks during the past month.
Blood measurements
Blood concentrations were determined on a specimen
obtained by venipuncture during the visit to the MEC.
Details of the laboratory procedures can be found in the
Laboratory Procedures Used in NHANES III10. The Coulter
Counter Model S-PLUS JR with Coulter histogram differ-
ential is a quantitative, automated haematology analyser
and was used to determine 16 haematologic parameters
including haemoglobin and haematocrit. Albumin was
measured with the Boehringer Manneheim Diagnostics
(BMD, Indianapolis, IN) albumin system and the bromo-
cresol purple binding agent. Folate was measured by
using the Bio-Rad Laboratories `Quantaphase Folate'
radioassay kit. Serum levels of vitamin A (retinol), vitamin
E (tocopherol) and carotenoids were measured by
isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography with
detection at three different wavelengths.
Serumtotalcholesterolwasanalysedenzymaticallyinthe
Johns Hopkins University Lipid Research Clinic Laboratory,
using the method of Allain et al.11 and the reagent mixture
from BMD (Cholesterol/HP, catalogue no. 816302).
Statistical analysis
Total and adjusted means and variances of dietary intake
and blood biochemistries were calculated using SAS
(Release 6.12, 1996; SAS, Inc., Cary, NC) and SUDAAN
(Release 7.5.2, 1998; Research Triangle Institute, NC).
Sample weights, provided by the National Center for
Health Statistics, were used to correct for differential
selection probabilities and to adjust for non-coverage and
non-response. Adjustments for confounding variables
were done using weighted general linear multivariate
regressions and we report the least of square means.
Significant differences between non-current marijuana
users and marijuana users were determined by two-sided
t-tests, and P-values are reported at levels #0.05 and
#0.0001.

Results
Among adults 20±59 years of age, 45% reported ever
having used marijuana, with 8% using it once or twice,
12% using three to 10 times, 12% using 11±99 times, and
13% using marijuana 100 times or more in their lifetime. A
total of 8.7% of the sample population reported using
marijuana in the past month, with 5.5% using one to four
times a month (light users), 1.3% using five to 10 times a
month (moderate users), and 1.9% using 11 or more times
a month (heavy users).
Table 1 shows the social characteristics of adults, 20 to
59 years of age, who participated in NHANES III by
marijuana use. Non-current users were older than users
and the proportion of men was higher among users than
non-current users. The proportion of participants with
annual household income of greater than $50,000 was
highest in the non-current users and lowest in the heavy
users. Similarly, the proportion of participants with an
education level of more than high school was highest in
the non-current users and lowest in the heavy users.
The proportion of participants who reported smoking
cigarettes was lowest in the non-current users and highest
in the heavy users. Among those who reported smoking
cigarettes, the mean number of cigarettes in the past five
days was also lowest in the non-current users and highest
in the heavy users. As shown in Table 1, mean body mass
index (BMI) was lower in the heavy users than in the non-
current users P , 0X0001 and these differences
remained after adjusting for age, gender, education,
cigarette smoking and caloric intake P  0X003 (data
not shown). A similar proportion was underweight
BMI , 18X5 among the heavy users (1.3%) and all
other groups (2.6% non-users, 2.3% light users, 1.0%
moderate users). The proportion overweight or obese
BMI $ 25 was also similar among all groups: 54%
among non-current users, 42% among the light users,
49% among the moderate users, and 42% among the
heavy users.
Dietary intake is shown in Tables 2 and 3. Total caloric
intake was highest in the heavy users. Light, moderate and
heavy users consumed 24%, 28% and 41%, respectively,
more calories than non-current users. After adjusting for
age, sex and education, the calories were 13%, 17% and
25%, respectively, higher than for the non-current users.
The percentage of energy from fat was lower among the
heavy users than among the non-current users, whereas
the percentage of calories from alcohol was higher in the
heavy users than in the non-current users.
Absolute and energy-adjusted values are provided for
the grams of protein, carbohydrate, fat and alcohol (Table
2), and micronutrients (Table 3). The absolute intake
reflects the actual amount consumed and is of interest for
examining differences in intake among the users and non-
current users. The energy-adjusted values are of interest
for examining the amount of nutrient relative to the total
energy intake. Absolute intakes among heavy users were
higher for all macronutrients and alcohol than among the
non-current users. Fat and alcohol intake remained higher
after energy adjustment.
Women tend to consume fewer calories than men, and
more men than women use marijuana. Therefore, we
compared dietary intake between male non-current
marijuana users and male marijuana users, and found
the macronutrient intakes to be higher in users than in
non-current users. We also compared women non-current
marijuana users and women marijuana users, and again
found macronutrient intakes to be higher in users than in

non-current users (data not shown). We therefore report
the combined, gender-adjusted data.
Vitamins B12
and B6
, folate, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin,
calcium, phosphorus, iron, zinc, potassium and sodium
were higher among the heavy users than among the non-
current users. Most of these differences were reduced or
disappeared after energy adjustment. Energy-adjusted
intakes of carotenes and vitamin C were significantly
lower among the heavy users than among non-current
users.
We subsequently examined the food-frequency data
(Table 4). The frequencies do not include serving sizes
and although we can determine the frequency of
consumption, we cannot compare the serving size.
Marijuana users had a higher frequency of beer, liquor,
regular sodas, pork, cheese and salted snacks consump-
tion than non-current users, whereas frequency of diet
sodas and fruits consumption was lower.
Table 5 shows serum values for various health
indicators and serum nutrient levels. Although serum
haemoglobin and haematocrit levels were higher in the
marijuana users than in the non-current users, the
differences were clinically small. Serum albumin, choles-
terol and triglycerides were similar between marijuana
users and non-current users. Most of the serum carote-
noids were lower in the heavy users than in the non-
current users.
Discussion
We examined food consumption, nutrient intake and
serum nutrients among US adults, aged 20±59 years, who
participated in the NHANES III and who reported using
marijuana in the past month compared with those who
did not report using marijuana in the past month.
Marijuana users were younger, had a lower income,
were more likely to be smokers and were less likely to
have completed high school than non-current marijuana

users. We found caloric intake to be higher among
marijuana users than among non-current users and that
the intake increased as frequency of marijuana use
increased (Table 2). Although energy intake was higher
among marijuana users, their BMI was somewhat lower.
Additionally, most of the indicators of nutritional status
(serum nutrients, serum albumin, haematocrit and haemo-
globin) were not different between marijuana users and
non-marijuana users.
The higher caloric intake findings agree with other
smaller studies looking at the effect of marijuana use on
caloric intake5±8. Foltin et al. found a 40% increase in
caloric intake among marijuana users7, while we found
that users had 24 to 40% higher intakes than non-current
users. We also showed that the higher caloric intake came
from higher absolute amounts of protein, carbohydrates,
fat and alcohol, and more specifically from the higher
frequency of beer, liquor, sodas, pork, cheese and salty
snacks consumption. It has been suggested that in addition
to stimulation of appetite, the reason for higher intakes
among marijuana users may be related to the notion that
marijuana is often used in social groups where food and
alcoholic beverages may be more readily available6.
In contrast to some studies that have reported an
increase in body weight with marijuana use5, we found
BMI to be somewhat lower among marijuana users than
in non-marijuana users. Given the higher caloric intake,
one might expect higher body weights among users than
non-current users; however, other factors may affect this
relationship. For example, higher energy intake may be
an indicator that physical activity and/or metabolic rate
could be higher among marijuana users than among non-
current users. When we adjusted caloric intake for
participation in leisure-time physical activity in addition
to age, sex and income, we found that the caloric
differences remained the same. We also adjusted for

cigarette smoking and again found that the caloric
differences remained (data not shown). Zwillich et al.
found that the metabolic rate of marijuana users increased
for up to 60 min after marijuana use in a placebo-
controlled study of eight volunteers8. Although we could
not test this hypothesis in our population-based study, a
higher metabolic rate may be a plausible explanation that
will need to be investigated further.
Some have suggested that drug users have diets poor in
vitamins and minerals, which could be a public health
concern3,12. We found that the majority of absolute
vitamin and mineral intakes were higher among mari-
juana users than among non-current users, and energy-
adjusted vitamin and mineral intakes were similar
between marijuana users and non-current users. More-
over, intakes for most nutrients were within the Recom-
mended Dietary Allowances (RDA) or the Dietary
Reference Intakes (DRI). Only folate intake was below
the DRI and this was the case for both marijuana users
and non-current users.
Serum haemoglobin, haematocrit, albumin and most of
the serum nutrients were within normal ranges for both
marijuana users and non-current users. This is in
agreement with Mendelson, who found no abnormalities
in blood chemistries in 70 male chronic marijuana users5.
We found, however, lower serum carotenoid levels
among marijuana users than among the non-current
users, which may be due to the oxidative effect of
cigarette smoking. When we examined serum carotenoid
levels stratified by cigarette smoking, we found that
among non-cigarette smokers, marijuana users had lower
carotenoid levels than non-current marijuana users.
Similarly, among cigarette smokers, marijuana users had
lower carotenoid levels than non-current marijuana users
(data not shown). These results suggest that marijuana
use is associated with lower serum carotenoid levels
independent of cigarette smoking. Sarafian et al. found
marijuana smoke to be a source of cellular oxidative
stress13, which may in part explain the differences in
serum carotenoids. The differences may also in part be
due to the lower dietary carotenoid intake, higher alcohol
intake, and lower frequency of fruit and vegetable
consumption among the heavy users than among non-
current users (Tables 3 and 4).
Using cross-sectional data limits our ability to assess
cause-and-effect relationships. However, these data are
very useful in estimating marijuana use and describing
intake patterns among groups of individuals. The 24-hour
recall does not reflect usual or individual intake and
does not include supplemental intake. It does provide
reasonable group estimates of dietary nutrient intake14.
The FFQ does not provide quantitative nutrient informa-
tion, but it does provide information on the usual
consumption of specific foods or food groupings. Little
is known about the cognitive impact of marijuana use on
diet recall. We also do not have information on the
amount of marijuana smoked and do not know the extent
of underestimation of marijuana frequency. Despite these
limitations, we consider that these data provide reason-
able estimates of dietary intake by marijuana use.
In summary, marijuana users had higher intakes of
energy and nutrients than non-marijuana users and did not
appear to have a poor nutritional status using indicators of
body mass index, serum nutrients, serum albumin,
haematocrit and haemoglobin. At the same time, marijuana
users had a higher consumption of sodium, lower fruit
intake, lower serum carotenoid levels, higher alcohol
intake, and higher rate of cigarette smoking. The long-
term health effects of these lifestyle habits among marijuana
users deserve careful consideration in future research.
