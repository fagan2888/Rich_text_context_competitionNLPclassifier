Abstract
Background: Education level is one indicator of socioeconomic position which, in several
countries including South Korea, is provided though death certificate data. Its validity determines
the usefulness of death certificate data for exploring the association between socioeconomic
position and mortality. This study was to compare education recorded on the death certificate with
that reported before death in a nationally representative cohort of participants in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Methods: The 1998/2001 NHANES data contained unique 13-digit personal identification
numbers that were individually linked to death certificate data from the Korean National Statistical
Office. Duration of mortality follow-up was 7.1 years. The data from 513 deaths were used to
determine sensitivity and specificity of education in death certificate and estimate agreement rates
of education level between NHANES data and death certificate data. Odds ratios for agreement in
education were also estimated. Covariates considered in the analyses were gender, age, duration
between NHANES and death, and cause of death.
Results: The proportion of deaths without recorded education in death certificate was very low
(0.2%). A total of 29.4% discordant pairs were found. Sensitivity and specificity for college or higher
education were 0.84 (95% confidence interval 0.71­0.97) and 0.99 (0.98­1.00). However,
sensitivity was poor for middle school education. The overall agreement rate was 70.7% (66.8%­
74.6%) when education was categorized into five groups and increased up to 88.9% (86.2%­91.6%)
when three education categories were used. The magnitude of validity and reliability for education
did not generally vary with age, duration between health survey and death, and cause of death.
However, a significantly smaller likelihood of agreement was found for middle and elementary
school education after adjusting for covariates.
Conclusion: Low percentage of missing information on education in South Korean death
certificate data could provide a great potential to monitor mortality inequalities. A more collapsed
categorization in education would be recommended when a more definitive conclusion on
educational mortality inequality is required.

Background
Education level is one indicator of socioeconomic posi-
tion which, in several countries including South Korea, is
provided though death certificate data. Its validity deter-
mines the usefulness of death certificate data for exploring
the association between socioeconomic position and
mortality [1]. Although education is likely to be more
accurately reported than measures such as income, some
evidence from Western studies suggests inconsistencies
can occur between education reported in health surveys
and that subsequently recorded on death certificates [2-4].
In a study by Lerchen and colleagues, a considerable gap
was found between education reported in health inter-
view data and education reported in subsequent follow-
up interviews from surviving spouses after death [5]. Con-
tradictory results have also been shown in other studies,
with some demonstrating a tendency for education to be
reported at a higher level on death certificates than at
baseline health survey, [2,3] while other studies showed
this was not true [1].
In addition, the reliability of reported education between
interview survey and death certificate data may vary with
decedent's gender, age, and educational level [3]. Educa-
tion can be reported less accurately for female decedents
since they are less likely than males to have surviving
spouses and are more likely to die at an older age [3]. The
overstatement of education was more common among
those decedents who, according to health survey data, had
a lower education level [3]. However, in a later study,
Rosamond and colleagues reported that death certificate
education level had substantial validity and that misclas-
sification was similar in both genders [1]. Reports have
shown that overstatement bias was more pronounced in
older than younger decedents [2]. Apart from these stud-
ies, little has been published on the validity and reliability
of education between health survey data and death certif-
icate data.
Education is known as a socioeconomic position indica-
tor that is less likely to change over time than occupation
and income [4]. As a result, misclassification of education
may not vary with the length of time between acquisition
of health survey and death certificate data. However, no
studies have proven this. In addition, little is known about
the misclassification of education by cause of death.
Recently, several studies have been conducted to examine
educational inequalities in mortality with use of census
and death certificate data in South Korea [6-8]. For exam-
ple, in prior studies we presented age-, gender-, and cause-
specific mortality inequalities by education [6] and exam-
ined trends in mortality inequalities by education [7].
However, the possibility of numerator-denominator bias
[9] could not be excluded in these studies since unlinked
data were used [6,7]. If education levels of the census were
more inflated than those of death certificate data, exagger-
ated educational mortality differentials could be made.
Son claimed that the reliability of education level between
survey and death certificate data can be poor [10]. A prior
Korean study examined the reliability of reported educa-
tion level between survey and death certificate data [11].
However, due to the small number of deaths, a more
detailed analysis by covariates such as cause of death and
duration between health survey and death was not possi-
ble and the validity (sensitivity and specificity) of each
educational category was not examined. Information on
gender, age, and cause-specific level of validity is useful to
assess any bias in the gender, age, and cause-specific mag-
nitude of socioeconomic mortality inequalities measured
with census and death certificated data. Therefore, the
purpose of this study was to compare education level
recorded on death certificates with that reported before
death in a nationally representative cohort of participants
in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) of South Korea. Specifically, we examined the
difference in the magnitude of validity and reliability for
educational attainment according to gender, age group,
duration between health survey and death, educational
category, and cause of death.
Methods
The Institutional Review Board of the Asan Medical
Center, Seoul, approved this study. The health survey data
used in this study were the 1998 and 2001 NHANES con-
ducted by the Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs.
Information was collected from a stratified multistage
probability sample of South Korean households repre-
senting the civilian, non-institutionalized population
[12]. Participation rates for the 1998 and 2001 NHANES
were 89.8% and 77.3%, respectively. At a baseline visit,
information on education level was obtained from an
adult household member. For each family member, the
highest education completed was reported. This data con-
tained unique 13-digit personal identification numbers
that were individually linked to mortality data from the
Korean National Statistical Office. By law, all Korean
deaths must be reported to the Korea National Statistical
Office. We identified deaths that occurred in the years
1999­2005 for those in the 1998 NHANES and 2002­
2005 for those in the 2001 NHANES. Duration of mortal-
ity follow-up was 7.1 years. Similar to that in NHANES,
levels of education reported on death certificates were
determined by the highest level of education completed.
The information on education was based on reports from
the decedent's kin.
Covariates considered in our analyses were gender, age,
duration between survey and death, and cause of death.
Duration between health survey and death was grouped
BMC Public Health 2007, 7:294 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/7/294

into categories of 3.4 years or less and 3.5­7.1 years to
allocate samples equally into groups. Causes of death
were coded according to the 10th revision of the Interna-
tional Classification of Disease (ICD-10) and grouped as
cancer (C00­C97), cardiovascular disease (I00­I99),
external causes (V01­Y98), and other.
For our analysis, we first compared education level
between NHANES data and death certificate data and cal-
culated the proportion of concordant and discordant
pairs. Then we determined sensitivity and specificity of
education in death certificate using the standard method,
[13] with education reported in NHANES considered the
gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity by cause of death
were not presented due to the small size of each education
group. We also estimated the agreement rates of education
level between NHANES data and death certificate data.
Overstatement and understatement rates were calculated.
Overstatement refers to the inflated education level
recorded in death certificates compared with that in
NHANES, while understatement means the reverse. Con-
fidence intervals (CI) for sensitivity, specificity, agreement
rates, overstatement rates and understatement rates were
calculated by asymptotic method. For these analyses, edu-
cation data from death certificates and NHANES were cat-
egorized into five levels (college or higher, high school,
middle school, elementary school and no education) and
three levels (college or higher, high and middle school,
elementary school or less). This was consistent with cate-
gorizations used in prior two studies [6,7]. Finally, after
adjusting for all covariates, we estimated odds ratios with
95% CI for agreement in educational attainment when
five and three educational groups were used. All statistical
analyses were performed with SAS statistical software.
Results
Unique personal identification numbers of 12,801 sub-
jects aged 20+ (6,900 for the 1998 NHANES and 5,901 for
the 2001 NHANES) were linked to mortality information.
A total of 513 deaths were identified: 376 deaths for the
1998 NHANES and 137 deaths for the 2001 NHANES. Of
these, 511 (99.6%) had education levels available from
both the death certificate and NHANES. One decedent
had no education information in the NHANES and
another decedent's education was not recorded in the
death certificate. Of the 511 participants included in our
analyses, 57.9% (n = 296) were men and 61.1% (n = 312)
were aged 65+. The mean age of subjects was 66.4 years
(SD 14.4). Decedent age varied with education from 52.7
years (SD 16.3) for those with college education or higher
to 75.8 years (SD 9.2) for those with no education. A
marked gender difference in education was also found
with 24.7% (n = 73) of men and 67.9% (n = 146) having
no education recorded in the NHANES. While the propor-
tion of those having college or higher education only
reached 2.3% (n = 5) for women, the proportion for men
was 8.8% (n = 26).
Table 1 shows the cross-classification of education level
by death certificate and the adult household member's
report at baseline visit in the NHANES of South Korea. For
511 deaths, 150 (29.4%) discordant pairs were found.
Inconsistencies were most common when education was
reported as middle school in NHANES. Of 54 participants
whose education was reported as middle school in
NHANES, only 25 (46.3%) were recorded as having mid-
dle school education in death certificate data.
Table 2 presents the sensitivity and specificity of educa-
tion in death certificate when education level derived
from the health survey was considered as the gold stand-

ard. The sensitivity and specificity of the death certificate
in classifying a decedent as having college or higher edu-
cation were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.71­0.97) and 0.99 (95% CI:
0.98­1.00), respectively. However, for middle school edu-
cation, the sensitivity was poor. While the level of sensitiv-
ity for high and middle school was greater in men than
women, this pattern could not be generalized to other
educational groups. A very low sensitivity (0.20) for mid-
dle school in women was based on the small sample
number (n = 5). With the exception of high school, the
sensitivity of education for ages 65+ was similar to that for
ages 20­64. In addition, the magnitude of sensitivity and
specificity did not vary with the length of time between
acquisition of health survey and death certificate data.
Table 3 shows the overall agreement rate, overstatement
rate and understatement rates with 95% CI. When educa-
tion level was categorized into five groups (college or
higher, high school, middle school, elementary school,
and no education), the overall agreement rate was 70.7%
(95% CI: 66.8%­74.6%). The magnitude of agreement
rate for education did not vary with gender, age, and dura-
tion between health survey and death. This was generally
true for cause specific analyses. The overstatement rate
tended to be greater than the understatement rate. The
education level of 87 (17.0%) subjects was reported as
greater in death certificate than NHANES data while 63
(12.3%) subjects were recorded with lower education in
death certificate data than in NHANES data. This was true

for both gender, age and causes of death except for exter-
nal causes. Meanwhile, the understatement rate for exter-
nal causes tended to be greater than the rates for other
three broad causes. When educational level was grouped
into five categories, understatement rate for external
causes was 20% while understatement rates for other
broad causes were about 10%. Based on logistic analysis
when the educational level was grouped into three catego-
ries, odds ratio of understatement for external causes (ref-
erence group = other broad causes) was 2.85 (1.15­7.05).
As presented in Table 3, the magnitude of reliability
increased as the number of educational groups decreased.
When the education level was categorized into three
groups (college or higher, high and middle school, ele-
mentary school or less), the overall agreement rates was
88.9% (95% CI: 86.2%­91.6%). For this categorization of
education, overstatement and understatement rates
diminished and there was no marked evidence of educa-
tion inflation in death certificate data compared with
health survey.
Table 4 presents odds ratio (95% CI) of agreement when
five and three educational groups were used to assess
agreement. When five educational groups were used, the
middle and elementary school education groups showed
a significantly smaller likelihood of agreement after
adjusting for gender, age (10-year age), duration between
health survey and death, and cause of death. However,
this was not true when assessing agreement with three
educational groups. No significant difference in odds ratio
was found for gender, age, duration between health sur-
vey and deaths, and cause of death, likely in part due to
small sample size.
Discussion
Results of this study showed that the proportion of deaths
without recorded education was very low, only one of 513

(0.2%) in death certificate, far less than prior US studies
in which information on education for about 15%­27%
of all deaths occurred was not available in the death cer-
tificate [1,2]. According to death certificate data covering
all South Koreans, the rate of failure to report the
decedent's educational attainment was 0.3% for men and
0.4% for women aged 35­64 [6]. This may be due to the
Korean death certification system where any vague or
missing item on the death certificate is further clarified by
the Korea National Statistical Office via telephone [6].
This low percentage of missing education information in
South Korean death certificate data could provide a great
potential to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in mor-
tality.
Direct comparison of the validity and reliability level
found in this study with prior reports in other countries
may be problematic because of differences in age distribu-
tion and educational categories used. Factors associated
with participation to health survey may also affect the
overall validity and reliability. Nevertheless, we may con-
clude that this study showed a similar or higher level of
validity and reliability in education information than in
Western studies. For example, the agreement rate for three
educational groups (less than high school graduate, high
school graduate, and greater than high school education)
in a prior study was 84% [1]. Results of this study showed
an agreement rate of 88.9% for the same categories. A
prior study presented a sensitivity of 0.85 for college or
higher education, [2] which is similar to what was found
in this study (0.84). It should be noted that in prior stud-
ies, a substantial number of subjects with missing educa-
tion information (15%­27%) were found but were
eliminated from analyses that reported the agreement rate
and sensitivity [1,2].
Despite the relatively high level for overall validity and
reliability, low sensitivity and agreement rates were found
in this study for participants with middle school educa-
tion. After adjusting for covariates, middle and elementary
school education groups were less concordantly recorded
in death certificate data. One possible explanation for this
may be related to historical changes in the education sys-
tem in South Korea. During Japanese colonial occupation
(1910­1945) and the Korean War (1950­1953), South
Korea could not establish a nationwide educational cur-
riculum [14]. An education system divided by elementary
school (6 years), middle school (3 years), and high school
(3 years) began in 1954 when the Ministry of Education
of Korea first introduced an official nationwide curricu-
lum. Various types of educational attainment, which are
difficult to group into the categories used in this study,
would be inevitable among decedents whose childhood
and adolescent education was achieved before the mod-
ern South Korean educational system was established.
Difficulties in determining one's educational level have
also remained in vital statistic records. For example, mid-
dle and high school levels were grouped as one category
in early 1990s death certificate data [7]. However, when
middle school and elementary school education were col-

lapsed into high school and no education respectively,
statistically significant differences in agreement of educa-
tion did not appear.
It was hypothesized that male decedents' education
would be more accurately reported by surviving female
spouses than female decedents' due to the gender gap in
life expectancy [3]. However, this study showed that the
agreement rate of education for women was generally
greater than that for men. Statistically significant gender
differences in odds of agreement were found for both edu-
cational categories (five and three groups) when only the
gender variable was entered into logistic model (data not
shown). In South Korea a woman's death is more fre-
quently reported by her children, who may know more
about her education than other informants. The widow's
cognitive or communication problems may lower the
agreement rate of male decedents' education. However,
the comparison of accuracy level between widow's report-
ing (for male decedents' education) and children's report-
ing (for female decedents' education) needs to be further
explored. If a woman's informants were uncertain as to
which education levels she achieved, it might be difficult
to accurately deduce and report the actual education level.
However, in this study reports of women's education in
the NHANES were concentrated around the "no educa-
tion" level (67.9%). The simplicity of a woman's educa-
tion might help informants for death certification to
report education information accurately. Based on logistic
model, significantly greater odds ratios of agreement for
women compared with men became insignificant after
adjusting for education (data not shown).
Although the magnitude of overall agreement rate for
education did not vary with causes of death, understate-
ment rate for external causes tended to be greater than the
rates for other broad causes. Higher understatement rate
for external causes was mainly due to stigmatized causes
of death rather than other external causes such as trans-
port accident. Understatement rate for suicide (n = 17)
was 35.3% (n = 6) while the rate for transport accident (n
= 24) was 8.3% (n = 2). Logistic analysis presented a
greater odds ratio of understatement for suicide (data not
shown). This suggests that a considerable understatement
for education may occur in stigmatized causes of death.
Overstatement and understatement of education by
descendants may vary with regions with different cultural
background. Results of this study showed a tendency for
inflation of education when grouped into five categories
but did not reveal any evidence of inflation when educa-
tion was collapsed into three categories. These findings
agree with prior US studies where inflation was found in
six educational groups [3] but did not appear in collapsed
educational groups [1]. Thus, when using unlinked data a
more collapsed categorization of education would pro-
duce a more valid result on estimating mortality inequal-
ity. However, as the sensitivity of college or higher
education was generally greater than that of no education
and the pattern did not vary with covariates, it can be sug-
gested that educational mortality differentials between no
education and college or higher education in the previous
study [6] were underestimated. Indeed, several longitudi-
nal mortality follow-up studies presented a substantial
difference in mortality by education in South Korea
[15,16]. Given that the level of agreement did not signifi-
cantly vary with cause of death, cause-specific analysis
may not result in biased results. However, a more col-
lapsed categorization in education would be recom-
mended especially when a more definitive conclusion
regarding educational mortality inequality is required.
Conclusion
The low percentage of missing education information in
South Korean death certificate data could provide a great
potential to monitor socioeconomic inequalities in mor-
tality. Despite the relatively high level for overall validity
and reliability, a more collapsed categorization of educa-
tion would produce a more valid result on estimating
mortality inequality when using unlinked data.
