Introduction
Identifying and understanding ideological categories ena-
bles observers of and participants in a political process to
summarize complex political positions efficiently. This
observation provides the foundation for many models in
political science used to determine ideological categories.
Spatial models, most notably the NOMINAL Three-step
Estimation (NOMINATE) models (Poole and Rosenthal,
1985), place both legislators and roll call votes into a spa-
tial context where the relative positions of the legislators
and the votes create the categories. In these systems, the
positions of legislators, which are given as ideal points in
the geometric space, serve as ideological markers.
One of the main findings in the NOMINATE literature
is that for most of the history of the United States Congress,
one-dimensional models reflecting our colloquial "liberal/
conservative" dichotomy are sufficient to explain the great
majority of roll call votes. The ideal points of the legisla-
tors on this ideological axis are estimated from the roll call
votes. As such, they serve as summarizations of various
forces that can influence the legislators' votes, including
personal preferences, party preferences, and constituent
opinion. Ideological groups are then determined by
groupings of ideal points. In this way, ideal point methods
(spatial models) derive ideological categorizations from
the characteristics of the individuals.
We take a different approach to the problem of identify-
ing ideology and sorting legislators into ideological catego-
ries. While spatial models summarize legislators as ideal
points measured relative to the positions of votes, our
model, which we call social identity voting (SIV), views
the legislator's ideology in terms of a weighted sum of the
ideologies of the groups to which they belong. This is moti-
vated by social identity theory (SIT), which posits that an
individual's social identity is determined by the collection
of groups to which the individual belongs (for a review, see
Hogg, 2006). Legislators derive utility from voting with the

and community structures

Abstract
Social identity voting (SIV) is a new model of voting behavior based on the principles of social identity theory. We
introduce and use this model to analyze roll call votes for the 35th through 112th US Congresses. Comparing out-of-sample
accuracy of SIV and Poole and Rosenthal's Weighted NOMINAL Three-step Estimation (W-NOMINATE), we find that
SIV performs better than the one- or two-dimensional W-NOMINATE model and that generally, W-NOMINATE needs
up to 10 dimensions to produce accuracy comparable to that of SIV. The differences between SIV and W-NOMINATE
are further clarified in three case studies: first, a longitudinal examination of all Congresses; second, an analysis of the
112th House of Representatives; and third, a study of the Tea Party caucus in the 112th House of Representatives. Each
study sheds new light on the potential motivations driving voting behavior, supporting our assertion that the SIV and
W-NOMINATE models provide two distinct approaches to understanding voting records. SIV, with its emphasis on
political identity derived from group membership, expresses combinations of individual and group preferences which
contribute to legislators' ideological classifications.

groups to which they belong and from voting against those
to which they do not belong. As a consequence, legislators
will select groups with ideologies consistent with their
own; subsequently, as group members, they face pressure
to conform in ideology to the majority ideology of that
group. Furthermore, in this model groups benefit from
larger memberships, as determining the outcome of votes
generates political power for the group and detracts from
other groups' political power.
Thus, the SIT framework suggests a model ­ the social
identity voting model ­ whose components can be esti-
mated from roll call data. First, we create the communities
using the roll call votes to group legislators together.
Second, we use the resulting mean votes of the communi-
ties to define their common ideological positions. Doing
this allows the communities to evolve over time, without
imposing groupings and labels that may not be universally
appropriate. We make one exception to this principle ­ we
fix the party caucuses as the dominant communities for all
the Congresses we study. We do this for three reasons. First,
in the United States, party affiliation carries a great deal of
information and weight ­ parties often provide infrastruc-
ture and money to support campaigns, and within Congress,
the legislative structure is defined entirely in the context of
party caucuses. Second, parties form the largest coherent
ideological units in a two-party system. Third, applying the
algorithms described below to the data yields partisan com-
munities broadly consistent with other results in the litera-
ture in almost all years (e.g. Porter et al., 2005; Waugh
et al., 2012).
To detect the communities, we use a variant of the parti-
tion decoupling method (PDM) (Leibon et al., 2008)
applied to roll call data. In this setting, the PDM detects and
delineates multiple partitions of a legislature at different
scales or layers. A first layer in the data is defined by party.
After identifying and removing the effect of the first layer
in the voting record, we derive the second layer from the
residual data. This layer reveals ideological groupings that
cannot be explained by party identification.
SIV applied to the US Congresses yields three main
findings. First, SIV outperforms W-NOMINATE with
respect to out-of-sample accuracy when we restrict to one-
or two-dimensional spatial models. In order to obtain com-
parable accuracy for the Senate, W-NOMINATE requires
10 dimensions. Even with this, in contrast to higher dimen-
sions in the W-NOMINATE model, the SIV clusters are
readily interpretable. For the House of Representatives, the
two are comparable except for two periods ­ after the Civil
War, and in the 1970s and 80s ­ where SIV uses only
one layer based on party and substantially outperforms
W-NOMINATE. Second, we find that in many instances
SIV and W-NOMINATE contain different information:
there is no clear mapping from ideal points to SIV groups.
This indicates that SIV is a new explanatory model for ide-
ological voting behavior. Third, SIV reveals interesting and
subtle details about the divisions between groups. In our
analysis of the 112th House of Representatives, for instance,
while some issues reveal groups whose members are defy-
ing their party's position, we find that several groups are
differentiated from each other by journal votes taken in
advance of contentious votes. Following Patty (2013), we
interpret this as intra-party signaling, demonstrating a
milder break from party orthodoxy for some groups than
others. Building on this new fine-grained ability to differ-
entiate inter-party signals, we also use SIV to understand
the extent to which the Tea Party is an independent ideo-
logical unit within the Republican Party at that time. We
find that it is not, but that it is rather two dominant, ideo-
logically distinct subgroups defined in opposition to the
broader party. In total, these findings demonstrate the nov-
elty and utility of SIV.
Theoretical underpinnings
Group membership and SIT
SIT is a theoretical framework for understanding group
dynamics. The foundation of SIT (Tajfel and Turner, 1979,
1986) rests on a distinction between personal and social
identities, where social identity is largely constructed
through group membership. Central to SIT is the thesis that
in social situations, social identity is the dominant force in
decision-making and action.
There is a large volume of literature on the construc-
tion and maintenance of social identity through group
affiliation (see Hogg, 2006), and while the full properties
of these mechanisms are not yet settled, there are some
basic principles that form a common foundation. First,
individuals aim to create and sustain a positive social
identity through group membership. Positivity is derived
from favorable comparisons between the individual's
group(s) and groups to which the individual does not
belong. Thus, individuals are motivated both to accentu-
ate the differences between groups and raise the reputa-
tion of their group(s). Second, once formed, groups can
exhibit in-group bias (Messick and Mackie, 1989; Mullen
et al., 1992). Bias can be both a result and a source of
group cohesion, although it is not a necessary accompani-
ment (Hinckle and Brown, 1990).
These kinds of ideas carry over to the political arena. In
political bodies, social identity is formed through member-
ship in many different types of groups, including political
parties, caucuses, and committees. We posit that the public
ideology of a legislator is largely determined by their social
identity, which in turn is at least in part articulated through
their group memberships. Not all group memberships are
explicitly declared; some can be revealed through action.
To this end, the theoretical underpinnings of SIT motivate
the articulation of group structure derived from legislator's
votes.
Pauls et al. 3
Social identity voting
SIV, based on SIT, thus emphasizes the construction of
social identity and its role in ideological identification. SIV
is built by delineating groups within the legislative body,
which in turn enables the estimation of weights measuring
degrees of group membership for each legislator. To com-
port with the other aspects of SIT, groups must be coherent
and facilitate intergroup comparison, which we accomplish
by assigning utility to the legislator based on his/her actions
with respect to the group's positions. We assess the utility
through the observation of public votes: legislators will
have high utility when voting in line with their group(s) and
low utility when voting against them. A central component
of group reputation is political power ­ large, ideologically
coherent groups have greater ability to determine the out-
come of votes. Thus, groups strive to maximize member-
ship without compromising their ideological profiles.
The NOMINATE family of models makes the strong
basic assumption that both legislators and bills can be
embedded into a spatial landscape where their relative posi-
tions determine voting behavior. One of the key novel fea-
tures of SIV is a relaxation of this assumption: in SIV,
legislators'votes are determined by the potentially conflict-
ing ideological markers of the groups to which they belong.
Methodology
Formal presentation of SIV
The vote data of legislator l who casts n votes is recorded
as a voting vector v l
j j

. Given a grouping of legisla-
tors, an ideological motivation is a voting vector
M v v

where i k
 ...
{ , , }
1 is an ideological group label, and vj
i is
defined as the mean of group i's votes on vote j.
The motivations Mi are the ideological markers of the
different groups present in the legislative body. To each leg-
islator l m

{ , , }

lator's membership in the different groups. Note that a
weight can be fractional ­ a legislator need not be "all in"
or "all out" with respect to a given group.
For a given vote, v l

where ( )
x is a smooth positive symmetric function with a
maximum at x = 0 and decaying to 0 as x  2 . Over all
votes, the total utility for legislator l is given by:
U l w l v l v

i j j

( ) = -

,
( ) ( ( ) ).
 (3)
It is easy to maximize utility if there are no other constraints
by simply placing each legislator into his or her own ideo-
logical group. Then, the motivation of such a (singleton)
group is simply the vote vector of the legislator, and utility
is maximized. But this group consisting of a single legisla-
tor has little political power. Consequently, we require
groups which are simultaneously large and have high total
utility over all members to balance political power and
coherent ideology.
After computing a set of motivations and weights, we
have an ideological representation of each legislator and an
approximation of their voting pattern according to their
ideology:
( ( ), , ( )) .

The initial application of SIV produces the components of
this representation: the partitioning of the legislators into
groups, the ideological marker associated with those
groups, and the social identity of the legislators derived
from group membership. Moreover, we can iterate SIV
multiple times, revealing different overlapping layers of
ideological composition.
Determining the elements of SIV
There are many different methods to find the groups that
define SIV. At one extreme, we can fix the groupings
according to information external to the roll call votes. At
the other, the groupings are determined from iterative
analysis of the roll call data itself. The latter thus shares
some similarities with NOMINATE, where the compo-
nents of the model are estimated directly from the data.
We take something of a hybrid approach and construct a
SIV model with two layers, one fixed a priori and the
other derived from data. The groups forming the first
layer, G G

we compute the components of the corresponding motiva-
tions (vote vectors)

The various pieces of the model for a second layer are now
calculated using a network theoretic formulation wherein
legislators are linked together by edges weighted by the
similarity of their voting records. Groupings are derived as
an optimal partitioning of the network. We use spectral
clustering to partition the legislator set into k clus-
ters,{ ,..., },
G Gk
1 which serve as the communities within
the legislature. These are subsidiary to the explicit party
structure. Using (5) and (6), we calculate the motivations
and weights for the second layer.
Spectral clustering requires two parameters: k, the num-
ber of clusters, and r, a parameter internal to the algorithm
related to the innate dimensionality of the data. To estimate
these, we use a holdout validation framework often used in
machine learning. We form a testing and training set from
the data. Using the training data to fit the model, we then
predict the testing data and measure the out-of-sample
accuracy of the model:

highest average accuracy over 10 holdout trials with the
testing data in each trial comprising 10% of the entire data
set. If multiple pairs achieve the highest average accuracy,
we choose the one with smallest k and, if necessary, small-
est r. SIV is a version of the PDM (Leibon et al., 2008). The
only modification is the deliberate choice of the first layer.
Others have used singular value decomposition (Porter
et al., 2005, 2007, 2009) or modularity (Waugh et al., 2012;
Zhang et al., 2008) for network community detection in
voting data. These methods differ by optimizing different
objective functions than does spectral clustering, but the
main difference between SIV and these approaches is the
construction of a subsidiary layer of overlapping structure.
For purposes of exposition and considerations of length,
technical details, code, and instructions for its use appear in
Appendix 1.
Data
We retrieved roll call vote data for the 35th through 112th
sessions of the US Congress from Keith Poole's Voteview
website. In order to make comparable the results of SIV to
W-NOMINATE, we use the standard pre-processing used
in W-NOMINATE's implementation in R: votes with less
than 2.5% of the total legislative body in the minority are
removed, as are legislators who voted on less than two
thirds of the votes. For SIV, we code "yea" votes as 1,
abstentions as 0, and "nay" votes as -1.
Results and discussion
One layer SIV: Party labeling carries a great deal
of information
The one-layer model, encoding only party identification,
has excellent out-of-sample accuracy (median 84.3% in the
House of Representatives and 80.6% in the Senate). This
result is consistent with literature that demonstrates party as
a dominant factor in determining voting patterns and fur-
ther supports our choice of the fixed first layer.
SIV outperforms W-NOMINATE
In out-of-sample accuracy, SIV generally performs as well
or better than high dimensional NOMINATE models.1
Comparing SIV to what Poole calls the "substantive dimen-
sions" (Poole, 2005: 141­155) ­ dimensions one and two ­
we find a persistent small advantage to using SIV. Figure 1
shows the out-of-sample accuracy of the SIV one- and two-
layer models (denoted SIV-1 and SIV-2) and that of
W-NOMINATE with at most 10 dimensions (WN-10).
Table 1 shows the quartiles of the differences between the
out-of-sampleaccuracyofSIVvs.WN-10orW-NOMINATE
with one or two dimensions (WN-2). In the Senate, SIV-2
always outperforms SIV-1 and WN-2, while it is very simi-
lar to WN-10. The picture in the House of Representatives is
more complicated. In two periods, after the Civil War
(1876­1883) and again in the 1970s and 1980s, SIV-1 out-
performs all models and the better of the two SIV models
outperforms both WN-10 and WN-2.
This is a new contribution to the discussion of the
dimensionality of roll call data (Cragg and Donald, 1997;
Heckman and Snyder, 1997; Poole, 2005; Poole and
Rosenthal, 2008; Poole et al., 1992). The debate over
dimensionality has been lively at times, but the general
conclusion that has emerged is that one or two substantive
dimensions explain virtually everything for US Congresses
(Poole, 2005). Additional dimensions seem to be "largely
fitting `noise'" (Poole and Rosenthal, 2008: Figure 3.6;
64), a point of view justified in part by the difficulty
researchers have finding apt descriptions for the higher
dimensions (the first dimension is interpreted in terms of
economic issues and the second, when relevant, is tied to
social issues). In distinction, SIV provides a different set of
dimensions which, when used predictively, significantly
best WN-2 in out-of-sample accuracy. These dimensions
Pauls et al. 5
are also interpretable: the contrast between the motivation
vectors of the groups provides ideological markers with
which to discriminate between them.
Both W-NOMINATE and SIV have a comparable
number of variables that are estimated or calculated from
the roll call data. We can encode the W-NOMINATE
model with d dimensions using d m n
( )
+ real numbers
­ coordinates of the ideal points for the m legislators and
cutting hyperplanes for the n votes. We can summarize
SIV with ( )( )
2 + +
k m n real numbers where k is the
number of groups in the second layer. The difference in
this measure of complexity for W-NOMINATE and that
of SIV is ( ( ))( )
d k m n
- + +
2 . Over all the legislatures we
study, this quantity is at times positive and negative, but
the median of the difference is 0 with quartiles{ , , }
-3 0 2 .
Consequently we have that, generally, models with com-
parable accuracy have similar complexity. Thus, if
out-of-sample accuracy and interpretability of the dimen-
sions are desirable, the use of SIV is warranted.
The 112th House of Representatives: a closer look
A detailed analysis of the 112th House shows two things:
SIV and W-NOMINATE uncover different information
about the legislators, and the motivation vectors give natu-
ral interpretations of the SIV groups.
To start, suppose the two models contain similar infor-
mation. We then would expect similar W-NOMINATE
scores for SIV group members and score separation between
different groups. We find some groups follow this pattern, but
others are not well-characterized by W-NOMINATE scores.
Figure 2 shows groups 1­6 are bipartisan and contain mem-
bers with very disparate W-NOMINATE scores. Groups 7­9
are partisan ­ one group of moderate Democrats (7) and two
Republican groups (8, 9) ­ and while their W-NOMINATE
scores are fairly coherent, they still overlap with those of
other groups. Table 2 in Appendix 2 lists group membership.
We can assess what distinguishes these groups by con-
sidering their motivation vectors. To compare group i and
group j, we record the 10 votes that best distinguish the two
groups: those with the highest value of v v

these votes concern appropriations for various agencies
(Defense; Homeland Security; Interior; Transportation;
Energy and Water; and Agriculture, Rural Development
and the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]). Other bills
deal with foreign policy, including votes relating to the War
Powers Act and withdrawing troops from Afghanistan and
Libya. Some groups are distinguished by their positions on
issues such as concealed carry laws, the Education Science
Reform Act, tax relief, small business investment, a bill
concerning asthma inhaler regulation, and the repeal of the

Affordable Care Act. Table 3 in Appendix 2 provides com-
plete details.
A significant number of these votes are journal votes, or
procedural votes that record the day's work. Some have
argued these journal votes serve a vital organization role as
a form of intra-party signaling: party leaders call for such
votes as a type of quorum call in advance of important or
controversial votes to ensure that a sufficient number of
their votes are present before proceeding (Patty, 2013;
Sinclair, 1995).
Appendix 2 details the Congressional votes before
which the journal votes were called. While these votes
appeared as distinguishing votes between several pairs of
groups, they were most significant in distinguishing Group
1 from 2, and 2 from 3 and 4. In these cases, the journal
votes give a measure of the members' loyalty to their party.
For example, most of the members of Group 1 vote with
their party on both the journal votes and the associated con-
troversial votes that follow, while most of the members of
Group 2 vote against their party on journal votes but vote
with their party during the subsequent Congressional vote.
Other than journal votes, these groups are defined pri-
marily along issues of appropriations and matters of
national security. This illumination of ideological structure
is not directly available via spatial models such as
W-NOMINATE, where one would need to look directly at
these votes and the groups of legislators to parse the same
information. One of the strengths of SIV over such spatial
models is the ability to identify such groups and their moti-
vation vectors automatically.
Case study: the Tea Party caucus
The "Tea Party" is a faction of the Republican Party that, in
the 112th Congress, formalized its membership as a recog-
nized caucus. Using SIV, we can analyze the ideological
structure of the Tea Party to understand the extent to which
it is an independent ideological faction.
In the 112th House, the Tea Party caucus splits mainly
between groups 3 and 9, with 40% of the Caucus in each of
these groups. Group 3 includes Representatives King
(R-IA), Bachmann (R-MN), and Gohmert (R-TX), while 9
includes Miller (R-CA), Barton (R-TX), and Sessions
(R-TX). Figure 3 shows a version of Figure 2 with the
Democrats removed and the Tea Party caucus highlighted.
As noted, groups are separated from one another on issues
of foreign policy and Defense ­ specifically on a resolution
to remove troops from Libya, appropriations for the
Department of Defense, and bills funding military con-
struction and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
They are also separated by two other bills: a bill funding the
Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and the
FDA, and one concerning the Education Sciences Reform
Act. The clearest delineation between the Tea Party por-
tions of the groups comes on an amendment to the Defense
Appropriations bill: the majority of the Tea Party members
in Group 9 voted against the amendment, while a majority
of those in Group 3 voted for it.
If the Tea Party caucus is an independent ideological
unit, we would expect that the Tea Party would largely
aggregate against other factions of the Republican Party
after we remove the first layer. Instead, it breaks down
into two primary groups with particular issues separating
the subsets. While the one-dimensional W-NOMINATE
model also demonstrates that the Tea Party is diffused
throughout the Republican Party, with ideal points scat-
tered through the ranks of the entire party, the one-dimen-
sional model misses the multiple party divisions that only
the SIV approach can illuminate.
Conclusion
SIV provides a new method for understanding ideological
categorizations based on voting behavior. SIV solidly out-
performs W-NOMINATE in out-of-sample accuracy when
the latter is restricted to one or two dimensions. Allowing
W-NOMINATE to use more dimensions brings its out-
of-sample accuracy roughly in line with SIV, but at a cost:
higher dimensions in NOMINATE models are difficult to
interpret, while the groups in SIV are easily compared
through differences in their motivation vectors.
SIV expresses ideological information differently from
W-NOMINATE, providing an alternate analysis comple-
mentary to the analysis of ideal points. A direct comparison
of the two for the 112th House of Representatives shows
that there is no clear mapping between the two descriptions,
a result that is typical of many sessions of Congress.
Consequently, we conclude that SIV and W-NOMINATE
provide different but equally valid methods for distilling
roll call voting data into manageable representations.
Three investigations demonstrate the potential useful-
ness of SIV over NOMINATE. We identify two periods ­
between 1876 and 1883, and in the 1970s and 1980s
­ where the one-layer SIV model, using only party identifi-
cation, outperforms W-NOMINATE significantly. This
indicates that situating legislators with respect to the mean
voting vectors of the two party caucuses is in those periods
a superior predictive model. Second, we discover that sev-
eral groups distinguished from each other by journal votes
in the 112th House. These votes, interpreted as within-party
signaling near contentious votes, show that SIV detects
fractures within party caucuses on two levels. When journal
votes distinguish groups, the groups are loyal to their cau-
cus, but are willing to send discordant signals to their lead-
ership. On the other hand, when the actual votes distinguish
groups, we see groups whose members are publicly and
directly voting against the party wishes. Lastly, an SIV-
directed analysis of the Tea Party in the 112th House shows
a split into essentially two subgroups which have issue-
specific ideological differences, demonstrating that the Tea
8 Research and Politics 
Party is not an ideologically distinct faction of the
Republican Party.
None of these findings are easily derived from the ideal
points produced by W-NOMINATE. By focusing on group
rather than individual preference, SIV provides a new lens
through which to view the forces that impact legislators'
voting behaviors and motivations.

Appendices
Appendix 1: finding ideological groups in SIV
Maximization of the total utility over all the legislators subject to our parsimony constraint requires a partition of the leg-
islators into k groups with high within-group voting agreement that are as large as possible. We approach this by viewing
the legislature as a network (a collection of nodes and edges) and re-formulating the maximization problem as a problem
of clustering on the network. The legislators are the network nodes. These are connected by edges weighted according to
the similarity of their voting records. For m legislators, this is represented by an m x m adjacency matrix A whose (i,j)
entry is the edge weight (possibly zero) between legislators i and j.
In this setting the utility maximization is re-framed as the graph (network) cut problem: finding a partition of the net-
work into k groups that simultaneously maximizes a within-group total edge weight measure while minimizing the total
edge weight needed to separate the groups from each other (Chung, 1995; Shi and Malik, 2000; von Luxburg, 2007). As
in social network analysis (Girvan and Newman, 2002), we use the solution of the graph cut problem to identify communi-
ties within a larger group.
Formally, a solution to the graph cut problem is a partition of the nodes into k groups {G1
, ..., Gk
} so that
cut G G

and vol G A

Solving the graph cut problem for this network therefore breaks legislators into groups that have high intra-group vot-
ing agreement but where intergroup voting agreement is relatively low (making cut G G
i i
( , ) small), while keeping the
groups relatively large (making the vol Gi
( ) large).
The similarity structure that we use is derived from a modification of the correlation of the voting profiles of the legisla-
tors. Given two voting vectors (1
(i),...,n
(j)) and 1
(j),...,n
(j)), we define the correlation between them as
c
v i v j
n s s
ij
k i k j
k

=
 ( ( ) ) ( ( ) )

where µi
, µj
and si
,sj
are the means and standard deviations of the voting vectors (respectively). We further define aij
=e-d
2
ij
where dij
=sin (cos-1(cij
)). This is a standard transformation of a similarity matrix (von Luxburg, 2007; see the case of "the
fully connected graph") into an adjacency matrix.
Alas, solving the (combinatorial) graph cut problem is NP-hard (all known algorithms have Non-Polynomial compu-
tational complexity) ­ essentially, it requires evaluating all possible partitionings into k groups ­ and as such is intractable.
Shi and Malik (2000) showed that the exact solution can be approximated by the solution to a "nearby" eigenvector/
eigenvalue ("spectral") problem. We use this spectral clustering algorithm to determine the groups within the legislature.
The details can be found in von Luxburg's excellent tutorial (2007).

The journal votes of the 112th Congress distinguishing the clusters came before other votes of import to the body,
including:
·
· The repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA);
·
· The Cut, Cap, and Balance Act;
·
· The Small Business Tax Cut Act;
·
· Appropriations for Defense and the Department of the Interior;
·
· Various regulatory bills;
