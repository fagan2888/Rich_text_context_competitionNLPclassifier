Abstract
Objective: Results of previous studies on diet and gallbladder disease (GBD), de®ned
as having gallstones or having had surgery for gallstones, have been inconsistent. This
research examined patterns of food intake in Mexican Americans and their
associations with GBD.
Design: Cross-sectional.
Subjects: The study population included 4641 Mexican Americans aged 20±74 years
who participated in the 1988±94 third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III). GBD was diagnosed by ultrasound. Food intake patterns were
identi®ed by principal components analysis based on food frequency questionnaire
responses. Component scores representing the level of intake of each pattern were
categorized into quartiles, and prevalence odds ratios (POR) were estimated relative
to the lowest quartile along with 95% con®dence intervals (CI).
Results: There were four distinct patterns in women (vegetable, high calorie,
traditional, fruit) and three in men (vegetable, high calorie, traditional). After age
adjustment, none were associated with GBD in women. However, men in the third
(POR = 0.42, 95%CI 0.21±0.85) and fourth (POR = 0.53, 95%CI 0.28±1.01) quartiles of
the traditional intake pattern were half as likely to have GBD as those in the lowest
quartile.
Conclusions: These ®ndings add to a growing literature suggesting dietary intake
patterns can provide potentially useful and relevant information on diet±disease
associations. Nevertheless, methods to do so require further development and
validation.

NHANES III
Gallstones or gall bladder disease (GBD) is an exception-
ally common source of morbidity worldwide, particularly
among women. Prevalence of the disease varies sub-
stantially across geographic and ethnic groups, and crude
prevalence is as high as 20% in some European1±3 and
native and Mexican American4±6 female populations. Diet
has long been of interest as a risk factor for gallstones.
Numerous mechanisms have been proposed by which
various dietary factors may in¯uence the formation of
gallstones, including effects on cholesterol metabolism,
bile lithogenicity and nucleation time7.
Ecological studies have noted a rise in the prevalence of
gallstones with more western diets, characterized by a
higher intake of fat and re®ned carbohydrate but a lower
intake of ®bre8±10. Overall, ®ndings from other observa-
tional nutritional epidemiological studies do not provide
strong evidence for an association with caloric intake or
intake of fatty acids or cholesterol11±19, but they offer
evidence of a positive association with simple
sugars12,14,15,19 and inverse associations with ®bre12,14,17±21
and alcohol5,12,14,16,19,20,22±31. While epidemiological and
aetiological studies suggest a role for speci®c nutrients,
however, it is unclear how these ®ndings relate to actual
dietary practice, since nutrients are consumed in complex
combinations. While perhaps useful for aetiological
understanding, such ®ndings do not directly address the
issue of whether or not certain characteristic combinations
of foods or food intake patterns are associated with
disease risk.
The objective of this research was to determine if certain
food intake patterns are associated with disease. Our goal
was not to elucidate aetiology, but to quantify the

aggregate risk associated with particular combinations
of foods32. We used data from NHANES III33,34 to examine
the association between food intake patterns and GBD in
Mexican Americans. We chose to focus on Mexican
Americans because prevalence of the disease is high,
particularly in Mexican American women; based on data
from NHANES III, age-adjusted prevalence in this
population is 8.9% in men and 26.7% in women, compared
to 8.6% and 16.6% in non-Hispanic white and 5.3% and
13.9% in African American men and women, respec-
tively35. We used NHANES III data to: (i) identify food
patterns in Mexican American women and men using
principal components analysis; and (ii) examine the
associations of these patterns of intake with GBD.
Materials and methods
Study population
NHANES III, a cross-sectional survey conducted from 1988
to 1994, followed a complex four-stage probability
sampling scheme designed to represent the entire United
States civilian non-institutionalized population over the
age of 2 months36. Mexican Americans were oversampled
to comprise nearly a third of the survey population, and
Mexican American ethnicity was self-reported. Participation
in the survey included interviews conducted at the subjects'
homes in either English or Spanish, followed by a physical
examination, a diet and health interview, and diagnostic
tests conducted at a mobile examination centre (MEC).
Disease status
Individuals between the ages of 20 and 74 years were
invited to receive a gallbladder ultrasound examination at
the MEC using real-time ultrasonography administered by
a certi®ed abdominal ultrasound technician. Cases were
de®ned as subjects with gallstones if opacity was viewed
in the gallbladder producing a distal shadow in both the
supine and the left decubitus positions, according to
commonly used criteria34. If the gallbladder was not seen
by ultrasonography and a right upper quadrant or
epigastric scar was observed, it was concluded that a
cholecystectomy, or surgical removal of the gallbladder,
had been performed. GBD was de®ned as either having
gallstones or having undergone cholecystectomy. Video-
tapes of all ultrasound examinations were independently
reviewed by radiologists specializing in abdominal
ultrasonography. The Kappa statistic37 was used to
evaluate agreement between technicians' and radiologists'
diagnoses and was found to be 0.94.
Dietary intake and other covariates
Household interviews included a food frequency ques-
tionnaire in which respondents estimated the number of
times per day, week or month that they ate each of 60 food
items during the previous month. Individuals were also
asked about the type of milk they usually drank; with the
replacement of one generic milk item with four more
speci®c milk items, there was a total of 63 food items from
the food frequency questionnaire. A list of these foods is
provided in the Appendix. The food list used for the
questionnaire is similar to those used in previous
NHANES, with several food items added to capture the
intake of important sources of nutrients related to cancer,
cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. The food list was
additionally modi®ed to include important foods con-
sumed by non-Hispanic whites, African Americans and
Mexican Americans, who made up the three major
subgroups of the NHANES III study population. Informa-
tion on foods consumed by these subgroups was based on
data from NHANES II and the Hispanic Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES). Food frequency
responses were used to identify patterns of food intake,
which were then related to GBD status.
Other interview information was obtained prior to
ultrasound examination. Regular breakfast consumption
was used as a proxy for length of overnight fast, and
attempted weight loss during the past 12 months was used
as a proxy for history of dieting. Subjects were classi®ed as
ever-smokers if they reported smoking at least 100
cigarettes during their entire lifetime. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated using measurements made at the
MEC. Information on reproductive factors for women was
obtained in a separate questionnaire administered at the
MEC and included current pregnancy, total number of live
born children, birth control pill use and oral oestrogen or
female hormone use.
Identi®cation of food intake patterns
We used principal components analysis38 to identify eating
patterns underlying the intake of foods in Mexican
American women and men (SAS version 6.11, SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). We conducted analyses in women
and men separately. Individuals were randomly placed
into one of two equally sized groups, or split samples, and
analyses were conducted in the two split samples for each
sex in order to con®rm the reliability of results. For each
of the four groups, we constructed a matrix of correlations
among the frequency of consumption per month for the
63 food items, and the correlation matrix was entered in
the principal components analysis.
The number of meaningful components to retain
from the total number extracted depended chie¯y on the
examination of scree plots and on interpretability of the
components39. Four components consistently emerged in
both split samples of women, and three consistently
emerged in men; thus, four components in women and
three in men were retained for rotation. Since orthogonal
and oblique rotations produced similar results, we present
the results from the orthogonal rotation only.
Although in general the same major patterns emerged in
both samples in women and men, slightly different sets of
foods loaded highly on each component across split

Food intake patterns and gallbladder disease
samples. To reconcile results from the split samples for each
sex, we identi®ed sets of `de®nite' and `possible' foods to
attach to each pattern. `De®nite' food items were those with
loadings of at least 0.30 in both split samples, but whose
loadings on other components were substantially less.
`Possible' foods were those whose loadings were above
0.20 for the given component in both split samples but less
for other components. The decision to include or exclude
these `possible' foods from the set of foods describing each
pattern was based on their effects on the component's
coef®cient alpha40, used to evaluate internal consistency for
each component retained. To ®nalize the set of foods to
attach to each pattern, we ®rst calculated a coef®cient alpha
based on both `de®nite' and `possible' foods together. If
removal of a `possible' food from the set resulted in a higher
coef®cient alpha for one or both split samples, then we
excluded that food from the pattern description.
We calculated factor scores for each pattern by taking
the unweighted sum of standardized frequencies of intake
for each food associated with the pattern. A factor score
was calculated for each dietary pattern for each individual
and was taken to represent the individual's level of intake
for the pattern.
Over 95% of the study participants responded to all 63
items in the food frequency questionnaire. Three
individuals who missed at least 54 items were excluded
from these analyses. If individuals were missing responses
on individual foods in any given pattern of food intake
identi®ed by principal components analysis, we imputed a
value for the missing food by taking the average
standardized frequency of all other non-missing foods in
that pattern. This was necessary in 40 instances in 38
women, and in 90 instances in 80 men. One man was
excluded from analyses on the traditional food intake
pattern because there were not enough non-missing
responses for other food items in that pattern to impute
values for missing foods.
Data analysis
We categorized factor scores into quartiles and calculated
prevalence odds ratios PORs as measures of association
between each food intake pattern and GBD41. PORs and
their 95%CI were estimated using unconditional logistic
regression modelling41 and were weighted using SUDAAN
software (SUDAAN version 7.0, Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) to take into account the
complex sampling design.
PORs were adjusted for age by including age in the
model as a continuous variable. They were further
adjusted for other potential confounders, including regular
breakfast consumption, attempted weight loss last year and
smoking history. In women, additional variables evaluated
as potential confounders were number of live births, ever
use of birth control pills, ever use of oral oestrogen or
female hormones, and current pregnancy status.
We also investigated the effect of controlling for BMI as a
possible intermediate in the pathway between some dietary
patterns and GBD. Because the log odds ratio for GBD did
not increase in a linear fashion with increasing BMI in men,
BMI was entered into logistic regression models as a
nominal variable, with BMI categorized as , 25, >25±29.9,
and > 30kgm-2, corresponding with categories of normal
range BMI, grade 1 overweight, and grades 2 and 3
overweight, respectively, as suggested by a World Health
Organization (WHO) Expert Committee42. We also left BMI
as a continuous variable in models for women since the log
odds ratio for GBD increased linearly with increasing BMI
in women. However, because results were similar
regardless of how BMI was coded, results are presented
only for the WHO method of categorization for both sexes.
We estimated PORs for selected individual foods from
the food frequency questionnaire that have been
associated with GBD previously. We estimated intake of
simple sugars from sweetened beverages and from
desserts. Monthly frequency of intake of sweetened
beverages was estimated by summing together responses
for regular sodas and Kool-Aid-type drinks, such as Hi-C,
Tang and Hawaiian Punch. Because including coffee and
tea did not materially affect results, we present ®ndings
without these two beverages. Desserts included summed
responses for chocolate and pastries, and alcohol included
summed responses for beer, wine and liquor. We created
categories of frequency of intake per month that were
equivalent to the following categories: never, less than
once a week, 1±2 times per week, 2±6 times per week,
every day and more than once a day. Categories were
subsequently collapsed depending on the frequency
distribution for each food item to ensure an adequate
number of subjects within each group.
We conducted tests for linear trend in the log odds ratio
of categories of intake for each food pattern by ®tting a
logistic model with age and an ordinal variable representing
the median factor score for each pattern quartile.
We performed additional analyses using more limited
case de®nitions by: (i) excluding cholecystectomy cases,
assuming that cases with gallstones at ultrasound were less
likely to alter their diets as a result of disease diagnosis or
symptoms; and (ii) additionally excluding gallstone cases
who had been told by a doctor that they had gallstones.
These exclusions served to limit cases to those least likely
to be aware of their disease status and, hence, least likely
to alter their dietary habits as a result of disease.
Results
Of 5551 Mexican Americans aged 20±74 years selected to
take part in NHANES III, 4641 (83.6%) ± 2306 women and
2335 men ± were interviewed at home and invited to
receive a gallbladder ultrasound. Characteristics of the
study population are shown in Table 1, and associations
between various risk factors and GBD in the population
are shown in Table 2.

We identi®ed four meaningful intake patterns in women
and three similar patterns in men (Table 3). The
components retained could explain only a small amount
of the variation in food intake in our population; together,
the four patterns in women accounted for 19±20% of the
total variance, while the three in men accounted for about
15%. Coef®cient alphas for the retained components are
also shown in Table 3.
To give an idea of the differences in food intake across
quartiles for each pattern, median monthly frequencies of
intake of selected foods for each pattern are shown in Fig.
1 for women and Fig. 2 for men. Median frequencies of
intake for these foods ranged from zero or once a month in
the ®rst quartile, to as high as once every day in the fourth
quartile. Mean BMI did not vary substantially by quartile
for any of the patterns (data not shown).
There were 2090 women and 2084 men with informa-
tion on disease status. Because adjustment for other risk
factors and for BMI did not appreciably change odds ratio
estimates or alter our conclusions, only age-adjusted
PORs are presented. None of the patterns of intake
appeared to be associated with prevalence of GBD in
women (Table 4). In men, the traditional pattern was
inversely associated with GBD prevalence: men in the
third and fourth quartiles of intake of this pattern were
roughly half as likely to have GBD as those in the lowest
quartile. Age-adjusted PORs were generally similar when
we used the more limited case de®nitions that excluded
cholecystectomy and diagnosed gallstones.
In analyses on individual foods (Table 5), alcohol was
inversely related to GBD in both women and men;
individuals who drank alcohol more than twice a week
during the previous month were about half as likely to
have GBD as non-drinkers. There was an inverse
association between beans and GBD in men only, and a
weak inverse association with desserts in women only.

Food intake patterns and gallbladder disease
However, no trend could be discerned in men for lower
GBD risk with increasing bean consumption. We found no
evidence of an association of GBD with intake of
sweetened beverages or ®sh (results not shown). When
we limited our case de®nition to gallstone cases unaware
of disease status, results were generally the same, but a
positive association emerged between beans and gall-
stones in women; PORs relative to those eating beans less
than once a week were 1.22 (0.73, 2.03), 1.24 (0.75, 2.06)

Food intake patterns and gallbladder disease
prevalence except the traditional intake pattern in men,
which was associated with decreased prevalence of GBD.
Among the individual food items that we investigated, intake
of beans was inversely associated with GBD in men, and
alcohol was inversely associated in both women and men.
Several studies have attempted to identify food intake
patterns in different populations using a variety of
methods43±54. We chose to use principal components
analysis to examine food intake patterns, ®rst identifying
foods that are correlated with each other or occur together
in the diets of our study participants, and then categorizing
people according to their level of intake of each set of
foods identi®ed. Although principal components analysis
has been criticized for de®ning patterns that may not be
reproducible across populations55, two patterns identi®ed
in the present study, the high-calorie and fruit/vegetable
patterns, resembled the `western' and `prudent' patterns
identi®ed in two recent studies conducted in two separate
US populations48,56. Hu et al.56 found the two patterns to
be reasonably reproducible and valid based on dietary
data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.
Another study looked at dietary patterns de®ned by
principal components analysis in Mexican American
women speci®cally, using data from HHANES46. Again,
there were similarities among patterns identi®ed in that
and the present study. The `nutrient dense' and `traditional'
patterns identi®ed in the HHANES analysis corresponded
with the vegetable and traditional patterns identi®ed in the
present study. Our `high-calorie' pattern appeared to be a
composite of the `transitional' and `nutrient dilute' patterns
identi®ed in that study. Other patterns identi®ed were
`protein-rich', `high-fat dairy' and `mixed dishes'. The
seven factors extracted in the HHANES analysis explained
59% of the total variance in frequency of consumption of
the food groups. In contrast, the three to four factors
extracted in our analyses could explain only 15±20%. The
difference in proportion of variance explained arose in
part because we extracted fewer factors. More important,
however, in the HHANES analysis, 47 foods were

collapsed into 18 food groups, and there is potentially less
unique variance among 18 food groups than among 63
food items, as in our analysis. We chose not to collapse
food categories because different individual food items ±
although it may seem to make biological or intuitive sense
to group them together ± are consumed in different
contexts and in different combinations of which we may
not be aware a priori. Thus, rather than create groups of
potentially dissimilar foods, we chose to use principal
components analysis to establish relationships among
individual food items empirically.
We are unaware of other studies that have systematically
described food intake patterns to evaluate GBD risk,
although two studies have found that vegetarians are less
likely to have gallstones than non-vegetarians57,58. Other
studies have looked at the association of GBD with
speci®c foods. Some have observed a positive association
with sweet foods19,59±61, and inverse associations with
®sh30,60±62 and with beans and pulses17,30,61,63. Observed
associations for foods may be attributed to speci®c factors
in these foods, or they may represent the effect of other
foods with which they are consumed in the diet.
In our study, there was no clear association of GBD with
sweetened beverages and desserts or with ®sh. We found
an inverse association with beans in men but no trend, while
beans appeared to be associated with higher prevalence in
women when we used a more limited case de®nition. An
experimental study in Chilean men suggested that legume
intake may increase biliary cholesterol saturation, thereby
contributing to gallstone occurrence64. Reasons for the
discrepant ®ndings regarding legumes are unknown.
Consistent with most previous research, we found an
inverse association between alcohol intake and
GBD5,12,14,16,19,20,22±31. Moderate alcohol intake may protect
against gallstone development through its association with
reduced biliary cholesterol saturation and higher serum
HDL7,23.
It is possible that diet is a more important contributor to
GBD in men than in women. While no strong risk factors
for GBD have emerged for men, several have been
identi®ed in women, including BMI, oral contraceptive
and oestrogen use, and parity. In the women in our study
population, BMI and number of live births were strongly
associated with GBD; these, rather than diet, may be more
important determinants of disease in this group.
Importantly, in men, a strong association with tradi-
tional intake pattern and GBD was found, while only a
limited, non-dose-related association was seen with
beans, which is a component of the traditional pattern.
Furthermore, it is unclear if the association between the
traditional pattern and GBD can be attributed to a single
speci®c component of the diet, such as ®bre. In this study
population, the traditional food pattern was associated
with a lower per cent of kilocalories from total fat, but a
higher intake of cholesterol and ®bre (data not shown). It
is notable, however, that one recent clinical trial found no
reduction in gallstone recurrence in individuals given a
high-®bre, low-re®ned-carbohydrate diet65. In additional
analyses in our study population, we found no major
differences in intake between those with and without
disease for any single nutrients of a priori interest,
including total fat, cholesterol and ®bre (data not shown).
Selection bias and selective over- or underreporting are
unlikely to have produced the observed inverse associa-
tion between the traditional intake pattern and GBD. The
extent to which the association might be confounded by
other potentially confounding factors such as physical
activity28,66,67 requires further evaluation.
Various features of NHANES III made it more dif®cult to
®nd an association between intake patterns and disease.
The dietary questionnaire used in NHANES III was not
designed speci®cally to measure dietary patterns. Also,
aspects of the food frequency questionnaire ± for
example, random error arising from dif®culty in estimating
frequency of intake ± may have attenuated correlations
among foods, leading to imprecise estimation of factor
scores. The grouping of dissimilar food items in the
NHANES III food frequency questionnaire may also have
attenuated correlations among foods, weakening the
factor structure of the food items, and contributing to the
relatively low coef®cient alphas we observed for some of
the components. A stronger factor structure might have
produced more internally consistent and precisely
quanti®able intake patterns.
Furthermore, dietary data were collected at the time of
disease ascertainment and may not re¯ect past intake or
intake during the relevant period of disease development.
Differential change in consumption patterns over time
may explain the failure to ®nd an association for some
dietary patterns. However, limiting cases to those
presumably unaware of their gallstones did not alter our
conclusions. Also, the proportion of non-cholecystectomy
gallstone cases reporting abdominal pain during the
previous year was similar to that in the non-case population
(data not shown), suggesting that most of them were
indeed asymptomatic. Although it is possible that such an
approach may limit ®ndings to asymptomatic or less severe
cases, we ®nd no reason to expect differences in risk
factors for the development of asymptomatic as opposed
to symptom-associated gallstones.
We found a traditional intake pattern to be inversely
associated with GBD prevalence, but only among Mexican
American men. This pattern proved at least as, if not more,
strongly associated with GBD as did examination of
individual foods. That none of the food intake patterns
identi®ed in women were associated with GBD may
suggest that other lifestyle factors are more important
determinants of GBD, such as BMI and reproductive
factors. The purpose of this research was not to uncover
aetiology but to determine if food intake patterns as a
means of characterizing dietary intake are associated with
disease. Our ®ndings add to a growing literature showing

Food intake patterns and gallbladder disease
that dietary intake does not have to be characterized in
terms of its individual (single nutrient) components to be
informative on diet±disease associations. Indeed, if
®ndings are to be used for preventive rather than
aetiological purposes, complete understanding of the
speci®c actions and contributions of individual compo-
nents may not be necessary ± an idea recognized in recent
clinical trials68,69. Measurement of dietary intake patterns in
observational studies can provide potentially useful and
relevant information on dietary in¯uences on disease risk,
but methods to do so require further development and
validation.
