Why are they worried?
Concern about HIV/AIDS in rural Malawi

Abstract
There are two main types of models of behavioral change. What are collectively
referred to as "individual models" are the predominant frameworks for studying risk
behaviors including those related to HIV/AIDS. Individual models focus on risk
perceptions, attitudes, outcome expectations, perceived norms, and self-efficacy.
Models of risk behavior that focus on social or community factors have more recently
been developed in response to criticisms of individual models. I use longitudinal data
from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project to study worry about
HIV/AIDS. Specifically, I ask, what factors determine how much a person worries
about HIV/AIDS, and are the predominant factors those that individual models would
suggest, or are there are other determinants that have a greater impact on worry? I find
that levels of network worry and suspected spousal infidelity have the strongest and
most robust influence on respondent worry, providing support for the importance of
social factors.

1. Introduction
In the literature on risk behaviors and behavioral change, there are two main types of
models. What are collectively referred to as "individual models" are the predominant
frameworks for studying risk behaviors, from smoking to unprotected sex. They are
also the predominant models used to study HIV/AIDS and its associated risk factors
and have been very influential in determining the nature of interventions designed to
stem the spread of HIV/AIDS in the developing and developed world. (Aggleton et al.
1994, Bunnell 1996, UNAIDS 1999, Denison 1996). The most influential individual
models used to study HIV/AIDS are the Health Belief Model (e.g., Becker 1974,
Rosenstock, Strecher, and Becker 1994), the Theory of Reasoned Action (e.g., Fishbein
and Ajzen 1975, Ajzen and Fishbein 1980, Fishbein and Middlestadt 1989), Social
Cognitive or Learning Theory (e.g., Bandura 1977), Stages of Change (Prochaska,
DiClemente, and Norcross 1992), and the AIDS Risk Reduction Model (Catania,
Kegeles, and Coates 1990).
To varying degrees, these psychosocial models, created using cognitive-attitudinal
and affective-motivational constructs (Kalichman 1998), are individual-centered,
focusing on the cognitive process leading to behavioral change (UNAIDS 1999,
Denison 1996). Based on the premise that humans control their own behaviors and
make decisions that impact those behaviors, these models consider how individuals
garner information about a particular behavior, assess its impact, and determine whether
they are willing and capable of acting differently. As such, they concentrate on
psychological and cognitive factors believed to influence behavioral change:
individuals' risk perceptions, attitudes and beliefs regarding risk reduction, outcome
expectations (which incorporate beliefs about the severity of a disease and perceived
benefits to action), intentions, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy, including
perceived barriers to action (Aggleton et al. 1994, UNAIDS 1999, Denison 1996,
Kalichman, Rompa, and Coley 1997).
Models and theories of risk behavior that focus on social and community factors
operating independently of individual factors have more recently been developed in
response to perceived limitations of the traditional cognitive-behavioral, individual
models. Purveyors of these newer "social models," which include Diffusion of
Innovation theory (Note 1) (Rogers 1983), social inoculation models (e.g., Howard and
McCabe 1990), social network theories (e.g., Morris 1997, Auerbach, Wypijewska and
Brodil 1994), and theories of gender and power (e.g., Connell 1987, DiClemente and
Wingood 1995), argue that behavioral change is not determined solely by individual
volition; rather, social relationships and structural and environmental factors constrain
people's options for change. According to a UNAIDS review article:
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 281
"[S]ocial researchers have come to realize that because complex health
behaviors such as sex take place in context, socio-cultural factors
surrounding the individual must be considered in designing prevention
interventions." (1999:5)
Consequently, social models concern themselves with influences that derive from social
relationships and the community of which the individual is a part.
"Social theories and models see individual behaviors embedded in their
social and cultural context. Instead of focusing on psychological processes
as the basis for sexual behavior, it tends to be social norms, relationships
and gender imbalances that create the meaning and determinants of
behavior and behavioral change." (UNAIDS 1999:10)
Factors considered by social models include social pressures, peer influences, cultural
expectations, economic factors affecting available resources, legal and political
structures, and political and religious ideologies that restrict individuals' options and
the flow of information (Aggleton et al. 1994).
One factor postulated implicitly or explicitly by almost all individual theories to
affect behavioral change is perceived risk (Bunnell 1996, UNAIDS 1999), which has
been described as the most salient feature of these models (Prochaska et al. 1990). The
bulk of HIV/AIDS interventions combine elements of various theories of behavioral
change, but perceived risk remains a critical construct for even these transtheoretical
approaches (UNAIDS 1999). The emphasis placed on perceived risk by theories and
interventions is supported by empirical studies that have found perceived risk to be a
prerequisite for or correlate of behavioral change (e.g., Cerwonka, Isbell, and Hansen
2000, Dodoo and Ampofo 1998, Estrin 1999, Lupton 1993, Weinstein and Nicolich
1993, Gillies and Carballo 1990).
In this study, I ask, what are the determinants of perceived risk? I also ask, are the
dominant factors individual-centered, the type of constructs that individual models of
behavioral change (which explicitly incorporate perceived risk) focus on? Or are they
social and environmental, the type of constructs that social models of risk behavior
argue matter most? I cannot definitively answer the question, "What causes perceived
risk?" since mine is a cross-sectional study. But I can explore correlates of perceived
risk, proxied through worry. As such, I ask two related questions: what factors are
associated with worry about HIV/AIDS, and are they predominantly individual or social
in nature?
The data for this study come from interviews conducted in 1998 and 2001 with
rural villagers in three areas of Malawi. In this population, worry is a good proxy for
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
282 http://www.demographic-research.org
perceived risk of HIV infection (Note 2). As Figure 1 shows, in Malawi in 2001,
current, future, and cumulative risk (defined as the maximum level of reported current
or future risk) were strong predictors of worry about HIV/AIDS; respondents who
believed that they were already infected or would become infected with HIV/AIDS
worried more than did respondents who reported that their risk of infection was
negligible. The correlations for men between worry and current and future risk were
0.36 and 0.37, respectively. The correlations for women were 0.38 and 0.42,
respectively.

Note:
Worry ranges from 1 (not worried) to 3 (very worried).
I chose to focus in this analysis on worry rather than perceived risk for four reasons.
First, the data set I use includes two rounds of data on worry but only one on perceived
risk. Since my ultimate goal is to contribute to theory building, it is advantageous for
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 283
me to be able to argue that the relationships I document are at least nominally enduring
for the population I am studying. This would not be possible were I to have only one
wave of data.
Second, worry, like perceived risk, has been linked theoretically and empirically to
behavioral change. For example, the Fear Drive Model of behavioral change argues
that fear causes discomfort, which in turn motivates behavioral change in order to
alleviate the discomfort. The Dual Process Model (Leventhal 1971, Leventhal, Safer,
and Panagis 1983) states that when a person feels at risk of an undesirable outcome, he
experiences fear, which produces discomfort. He can alleviate the discomfort either by
managing the emotion or by eliminating the danger that produces it. The title of the
model refers to the two components operating in parallel: fear control, or control of
one's emotions, and danger control, or as applied to HIV/AIDS, behavioral change.
According to the Fear Reduction Model (Rosenbaum and Heath 1990), information
about a potential threat produces a subjective feeling of risk, which in turn produces
fear and concern regarding the severity of the potential outcome. Fear and concern
motivate behavioral change. Lastly, the Virus of Fear Model (Ostrow 1990), which
draws an analogy between the process by which fear and contagion spread, asserts that
media-induced fear leads either to positive change or to panic, paralyzation, and
feelings of fatalism and hopelessness. Bunnell (1996) points out that in areas with high
HIV/AIDS prevalence and limited media penetration, the "fear environment" that
results from watching friends and family die from AIDS is probably a more potent
"transmitting agent" of fear than is the media.
Third, individual models typically emphasize intentions as an important precursor
to behavioral change, and some argue that emotions play an important role in their
determination. In fact, models that lack an emotive element have been criticized for
failing to explicitly consider the emotional arousal implicit in perceiving that one is at
risk of experiencing a negative outcome (Bunnell 1996). In the population I am
studying, worry is closely related to perceived risk. Yet worry adds an emotive
component that perceived risk lacks, which may render it a better predictor of
behavioral change. Lastly, some researchers have questioned the assumption implicit in
individual models that people perceive their risk accurately. Because worry is
universally experienced and more emotionally based than perceived risk, respondents
may have less difficultly understanding the concept of worry and articulating their
levels of worry than describing their perceived risk. For the same reasons, worry may
also be less prone to translation error (Note 3).
In order to determine what factors contribute to rural Malawians' worry about
contracting HIV/AIDS, I constructed a series of ordered categories logistic regression
models in which I regress respondents' levels of worry on a number of individual and
social factors. What these regressions say overall is that a person's worry about
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
284 http://www.demographic-research.org
contracting HIV/AIDS is little influenced by his own characteristics or behaviors.
What does make a difference is the behavior and worries of other people in his life.
Whether someone believes her spouse to be unfaithful or not matters. But even more
strongly associated with how much a respondent worries is how much people with
whom he converses about HIV/AIDS worry. The overall message of this analysis is
that social factors are important predictors of worry. Consequently, the assumption
implicit in conventional models of health behavior, that individual factors are the
primary determinants of perceived risk, is unsupported in this sample of rural
Malawians.
Most HIV/AIDS interventions consist of attempts to promote behavioral change,
either by educating or providing skills training (UNAIDS 1999, Bunnell 1996). The
overall results of these efforts have been disappointing (Bunnell 1996). Some
researchers have attributed the lackluster performance of prevention programs to
inadequacies in our collective understanding of the process of behavioral change and
how it varies across contexts. As the authors of a UNAIDS study observed, "most
behavioral models measure risk as individually determined which might not be relevant
in many contexts" (UNAIDS 1999:11). By investigating whether perceived risk is
influenced by factors other than those postulated by individual models to matter, this
study sheds light on the behavioral change process and its contextual variations. On a
theoretical level, it broadens understanding of how behavioral change models and risk
perception theory can be applied to non-Western contexts. On a practical level, it
informs strategies for HIV/AIDS prevention, providing information relevant to the
design of effective interventions in Malawi and other high prevalence areas.
2. Data & methods
The data that I use for this study comes from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational
Change Project (MDICP). Survey data were collected during the summers of 1998 and
2001 in three rural districts of Malawi: Rumphi District, located in the northern part of
the country, Balaka District, in the south, and Mchinji District, in the central region.
Extensive qualitative data also were collected as part of several smaller projects
associated with the MDICP. The first round of survey data consists of interviews with
1541 ever-married women of childbearing age (15-49) and 1065 men, husbands of the
currently married women. In the second round of data collection, these same
respondents and any new spouses were interviewed. Response rates for both waves
were high. In 1998, only 1.7% of men and 1.0% of women refused to be interviewed.
In 2001, the corresponding figures were equally low: 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively. In
regards to attrition, 16% of males interviewed in the first wave were lost to follow-up.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 285
Eleven percent of those died between surveys, and 0.5% were hospitalized or too ill to
be re-interviewed. Nineteen percent of the original female sample was lost to follow-
up; 14% of women not re-interviewed died between surveys, and 1.4% were ill or in the
hospital. The sample is described in greater detail in Watkins et al. (2003). More
information is also available at www.pop.upenn.edu/Social_Networks.
The questions that I seek to answer in this study are, what determines how much a
person worries about contracting HIV/AIDS, and are the predominant factors those that
the prevailing models of health behaviors would suggest, or are there other factors that
have a greater impact on the "average" Malawian's level of concern? To answer these
related questions, I constructed a series of cumulative logit models for ordered
categories analysis. The dependent variable was the respondent's answer to the
question, "How worried are you that you might catch AIDS?" Possible answers were
"Not worried at all," "Worried a little," "Worried a lot," and "Don't know." In the field,
great care was taken by the interviewing team to ensure that the question was translated
correctly and consistently. In my analysis, I discarded all cases (2 men, 12 women) in
which the respondent answered, "Don't know."
The underlying construct, worry, is in theory continuous, but for the purposes of
this study, it is measured in discrete categories that range from low to high. Because
the distance between categories is not fixed, appropriate methods for analysis need to
account for the potentially variable distance between categories. Ordered logit
regression, which is also known as cumulative logit regression, is well suited to this
task. In an ordered logit regression, the dependent variable consists of J ordered
categories, represented by the integers 1,2,...,J. The jth cumulative odds is the
probability of giving a response in category j or lower, as opposed to giving a response
in the category j+1 or higher. The log of this odds, the Jth cumulative logit, can be
modeled as a linear function (Allison 1999).
I selected my independent variables based on what the literature, models of health
behavior, and qualitative work associated with the MDICP survey suggested might
impact respondent worry about HIV/AIDS. For a detailed listing of the variables
analyzed, see Table 2. Empty cells in the table correspond to questions that were not
asked for that particular sex and wave. The variables of interest were divided into two
groups, individual and social, according to the underlying constructs they measure.
Individual factors tested consist of behaviors, knowledge and beliefs, and proxies for
outcome expectations. Social factors tested consist of perceptions of spouses' behavior,
characteristics of respondents' HIV/AIDS conversational networks, and community
markers. Since I lack adequate measures for capturing every salient component of any
given behavioral change model or theory, the purpose of this analysis is not so much to
refute the validity of a class of models as to argue for the importance of factors
neglected by that class.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
286 http://www.demographic-research.org
I restricted the analysis to respondents interviewed in both waves and with no
missing data for the variables of interest. I also excluded respondents who reported
having discussed AIDS with no one (74 men, 221 women) or who did not know how
worried at least one of their conversational network partners was (14 men, 17 women),
yielding a total of 878 women and 660 men. Analyzing males and females separately, I
conducted bivariate tests of association with worry for each variable in each wave. To
determine which relationships were significant after controlling for other relevant
factors, I combined the variables that were significant in the bivariate models in a series
of nested multivariate models. To qualify for inclusion, a variable had to be
longitudinal and at least marginally significant for either sex in either wave. Data were
collected in 145 villages in the first wave and 152 villages in the second wave. To
adjust for the possibility that observations were not independent within villages, I used
the Huber/White/sandwich estimator of variance method to calculate robust standard
errors in all models. I also used likelihood ratio tests to confirm that models with social
variables provided a significantly better fit to the data than did models without them.
The prevalence of HIV infection in Malawi ranks among the highest in the world.
At the end of 1999, an estimated 16% of adults were sero-positive (UNAIDS/WHO
2000). According to government estimates based on sentinel surveillance data from
antenatal clinics, 17% of pregnant women in Mchinji were HIV positive in 1998. In
Rumphi, the figure was 12.5%, and in Balaka, it was 14.9% (National AIDS Control
Programme 1998). Despite the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi, few people get
tested for HIV. For the purposes of this analysis, I assume that most people do not know
their HIV status. I also assume that those who do know or suspect that they have
HIV/AIDS will report that they are more rather than less worried about contracting the
disease. Given the afore-mentioned positive association between believing that you
already have AIDS and reporting that you are worried about contracting it, this seems a
safe assumption.
2.1. Individual factors
Behaviors. Two basic tenets in the theoretical and empirical literature on behavioral
change are that high perceived risk prompts the adoption of protective behaviors, and
positive behavioral change in turn reduces perceived risk (Weinstein and Nicolich 1993,
Bunnell 1996). The reciprocity of this relationship points to the need for establishing
sequential ordering when analyzing associations between perceived risk and behavioral
change. The MDICP contains no direct measure of behavioral change in response to
HIV/AIDS and only one indirect measure, previous experience with condoms.
Unfortunately, this variable lacks a time referent, which opens up its analysis to the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 287
problem of reverse causation. But because unprotected sex is a major HIV risk factor
and consistent condom use a widely promoted strategy for avoiding HIV/AIDS, I
decided to look at it regardless.
I looked at the effects of two behavioral constructs on respondent worry: previous
experience with condoms and having engaged in extramarital sex. For the former, I
used a variable constructed from questions regarding past condom use as a form of
contraception and with premarital and extramarital partners (Note 4). To measure
extramarital sexual activity, I used two indirect and one direct measure, answers to the
question, "Have you yourself slept with anyone other than your husband/wife in the last
12 months" (Note 5). The indirect measures that I used were answers to two questions
regarding time spent away from home. The first question asked whether the respondent
had spent more than one month of the past year away. The second asked whether the
respondent (if male) or her husband (if the respondent was female) usually "stays" in
his wife's village. Qualitative accounts suggest that men and women regard extended
spousal separations as opportunities for both spouses to stray, and an extensive
literature has argued that by separating husbands and wives for lengthy periods of time,
labor migration promotes extramarital sexual activity, thereby contributing to the spread
of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa (Packard and Epstein 1991, Aggleton et al. 1994,
Quinn 1994, Hunt 1996).
Knowledge/beliefs. Individual models of health behavior regard knowledge and
beliefs as important predictors of behavioral change (Bunnell 1996). Past research has
found that HIV/AIDS-related knowledge is significantly related to AIDS-related worry
(Klepinger et al. 1993), perceived risk (London and Robles 2000), and behavioral
change (Gregson et al. 1998). I test whether worry is related to four indicators of
knowledge about HIV/AIDS. The first variable indicates respondents' awareness that
even people who appear healthy may be HIV positive. The second measures beliefs
regarding the infectiousness of HIV (Note 6). The third variable, answers to the
question, "If a person gets very thin and dies, what disease do you think probably killed
them?", indicates an awareness of the presence of HIV/AIDS in the community and a
willingness to attribute local deaths to the disease.
One factor explicitly considered by individual models to affect behavioral change
is exposure to information about a potential threat. Previous research documented a
positive relationship between exposure to HIV/AIDS information and both worry
(Klepinger et al. 1993, Gregson et al. 1998) and perceived risk (London and Robles
2000). The final variable in the series is therefore a measure of exposure to HIV/AIDS
information from "expert" (as opposed to lay) sources. Values range from zero (having
had no exposure) to three (having received information from a community-based health
officer, a hospital or clinic, and via the radio).
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
288 http://www.demographic-research.org
Outcome Expectations. Individual theories emphasize that before people will be
motivated to avoid behaviors that put them at risk of acquiring an illness, they must first
believe that having that illness is both undesirable and avoidable. Two variables--
number of funerals attended in the past month and number of acquaintances suspected
to have died of HIV/AIDS--indirectly measure respondents' beliefs in the severity of
HIV/AIDS and the threat it poses. They also serve as rough proxies for perceived
prevalence of death due to AIDS (Note 7).
2.2. Social factors
Spouse. Individual models of HIV/AIDS-related behavioral change have been
criticized for giving inadequate attention to the role of spouses in facilitating or
impeding change (Denison 1996). In my sample of ever-married women and their
husbands, the behavior of current and ex-spouses constitutes a major source of past or
current HIV risk. The first variable in this series is therefore marital status. I include
the full four-category version of this variable in Table 2 for interest only, as most of the
categories have too few cases to allow for analyzing them separately. I distinguish
between monogamous and polygynous unions in the operational version of this variable
because polygyny has been shown by other studies to be positively associated with
perceived risk of HIV infection (Bunnell 1996). The second variable in the series is
respondents' perceptions of their spouses' fidelity. Respondents were asked whether
they know or suspect that their spouse has had extramarital sex during the course of
their marriage. Possible answers were "Yes" or "Suspect," "Don't know" or "Can't
know what (s)he does," and "Probably not." Respondents who answered "Probably
not" but reported elsewhere in the survey that their greatest risk of HIV/AIDS infection
comes from their spouse were recoded "Can't/Don't know." The third variable in this
series is answers to a question regarding the acceptability of using a condom with a
spouse.
Social models emphasize that social and cultural factors must be considered when
accounting for behavioral change or lack thereof. One factor frequently blamed for the
spread of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa and the unusually high percentage of
women that are infected is women's inferior position relative to men (Caldwell,
Caldwell, and Orubuloye 1989, Caldwell and Caldwell 1993, Chirwa 1993, Dodoo and
Ampofo 1998, McGrath et al. 1993, Ntozi and Kirunga 1997, Ray et al. 1995, Ray,
Gumbo, and Mbizvo 1996, Van de Wijgert et al. 1999, Watts et al. 1998). The basic
argument is that a multitude of factors forces women to "submit to their partner's [sic]
demands for sex" (Watts et al. 1998), impeding their ability to protect themselves
against HIV infection. Foremost among these factors is women's financial dependence
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 289
on their sexual partners due to limited economic opportunities for women. In its
extreme form, this dependence drives women into prostitution (Caldwell and Caldwell
1993, Quinn 1994). In its milder form, it reduces their ability to leave unfaithful lovers
or husbands and to insist on condom use during sex with risky partners (Aggleton et al.
1994). The fourth variable in this series is therefore whether or not the respondent
herself reports earning money, either in cash or kind. If it is the case that, by
eliminating their ability to deny sex, women's financial dependence on their sexual
partners increases their risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, then women with no independent
income should worry more about HIV/AIDS than should women with independent
income (Note 8). In support of this hypothesis, research in Zimbabwe (Watts et al.
1998) found that women with earnings worry less about HIV/AIDS than do women
without earnings. Conversely, if men use cash or financial clout to effectively
"purchase" sex--or at least, control over sex--then men with no independent income,
because their access to payment and influence is reduced, might worry less about
HIV/AIDS. Since previous research (Garnet and Anderson 1993) has suggested that
the tradition in sub-Saharan Africa of women marrying substantially older men has
contributed to the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS in the region, the final variable in this
series is respondents' reports of the difference between their and their current or most
recent spouse's age.
AIDS Conversational Networks. A central tenet of social theories of health
behavior is that social norms and relationships have a profound influence on people's
understandings of social phenomena and their motivations to change. According to this
view, the opinions and actions of those with whom a rural Malawian discusses
HIV/AIDS will play a significant role in shaping her own opinions and actions. The
variables concerning respondents' HIV/AIDS conversational networks assess the
magnitude of that influence in regards to worry about HIV/AIDS. Respondents were
asked with how many people they had chatted about HIV/AIDS; their answers
constitute the first variable in the series. They were then asked a number of HIV/AIDS-
related questions regarding up to four of these conversational, or network, partners.
The second variable is the number of network partners reported on (maximum of four).
The third variable indicates having a least one network partner who is moderately or
very worried about HIV/AIDS. The fourth variable is the number of network partners
who are moderately or very worried about HIV/AIDS. The final variable in the series is
the average level of worry of one's network partners. Ranging from 1 (not worried) to 3
(very worried), it was constructed by summing the worry of each network partner and
dividing the total by the number of partners (Note 9). To determine whether the
influence on respondent worry of network-partner worry depends on the size of
respondents' networks, I tested for an interaction between the two variables; when the
interaction term was significant in the bivariate models, it was retained in the
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
290 http://www.demographic-research.org
multivariate models. Because the network variables were highly collinear, I included only
number of network partners and average partner worry in the multivariate models.
Community Markers. Social theories emphasize the importance of environment
and social context in facilitating or impeding behavioral change. I include the final set
of variables, community markers, as indictors of extended social networks and cultural
or social environments that might impact respondents' experiences with HIV/AIDS.
Some of the variables denote membership in cultural groupings (e.g., religious
affiliation and ethnicity). Others, like region of residence, more abstractly assume that
people living in close proximity share similar cultural ideologies and social structures
(e.g., political, legal, and economic ideologies and structures) that shape their responses
to HIV/AIDS. The first variable in this series is religious affiliation. This variable was
coded differently in each wave, so to make the waves comparable, I combined the
categories "Protestant," "Revivalist," and "Traditional." The second variable, answers
to a question regarding the last time the respondent attended a religious service,
measures religiosity. The last two variables in this series are ethnic identification and
region of residence.
2.3. Demographic control variables
I control for age, education (specifically, the highest level of schooling attended), and
household wealth in the multivariate models. The wealth index, which ranges from 0
(poor) to 13.7 (rich), is a relative measure constructed by summing the number of
household items a respondent owns, weighted by the likelihood of owning each item in
the survey population. The possessions considered were a bed, sofa, lantern, bicycle,
metal roof, plough, and pit latrine.
I include education as a control variable because it has been shown to be
associated in sub-Saharan Africa with both fear (Ntozi and Kirunga 1997) and actual
risk (Dodoo and Ampofo 1998) of contracting HIV/AIDS. Research has shown that
over the last decade, highly educated people responded to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by
altering their AIDS-related behaviors to a greater extent than did less educated people
(Ntozi and Kirunga 1997, UNAIDS/WHO 2000). As a result, whereas in the early
1990s, risk of infection was positively associated with education, by the end of the
decade, the relationship had reversed (UNAIDS/WHO 2000). I control for age because
it, too, has been found to be associated with worry about HIV/AIDS (Ntozi and Kirunga
1997).

3. Results
Levels of worry in this sample are high, as shown in Table 1. In 1998, approximately
three-quarters of respondents reported that they worry about AIDS, although by 2001,
the proportion had declined to two-thirds. Worry declined over time for both sexes,
although in both waves, women were more likely than men to report being worried.
Women also were more likely to report that they already have HIV/AIDS or will
eventually contract it. Only 5% of women and 2% of men report that they do not know
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9

292 http://www.demographic-research.org
their risk of either having or contracting HIV/AIDS. The literature on HIV/AIDS in
Africa resounds with descriptions of the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS and people's
unwillingness to publicly entertain the possibility of their having it. The MDICP data
do not support this view, as evident in the nontrivial percentage of respondents who
report that the likelihood that they are currently infected is high.
3.1. Univariate and bivariate results
The results of the univariate and bivariate analyses are presented in Table 2. In this
section, I will restrict my discussion of results to variables excluded from the
multivariate analyses because they are not longitudinal or are not significantly related to
worry.

Individual factors. The percentage of respondents that report having had
extramarital sex did not change significantly from one wave to the next. Men's greater
reporting of infidelity is consistent with the literature's contention that in sub-Saharan
Africa, men are the more promiscuous sex (e.g., McGrath et al. 1993, Ray, Gumbo, and
Mbizvo 1996). However, given the illicit nature of infidelity, both men and women
likely underreported their extramarital sexual activity. As evidence of this possibility,
on average 2.5% of female and 10.5% of male respondents report having engaged in
extramarital sex in the past year, but a comparatively whopping 18% and 26%,
respectively, say their best friends have. The large discrepancy between these two sets
of figures casts doubt on the veracity of respondents' reporting of sexual partnerships,
especially their own.
Basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS, as indicated by the question about knowing a
person's sero-status from her appearance, is high and perhaps saturated given the lack of
change from one wave to the next. People are aware of the presence of HIV/AIDS in
their community, as indicated by the preponderance that attribute thinness followed by
death to HIV/AIDS. A majority of both men and women mistakenly believe that a
single act of unprotected sex with an infected person is certain to give you HIV.
Reporting that sex once with an infected person is not guaranteed to give you HIV is
positively associated with worrying about HIV/AIDS for men, negatively associated for
women. Respondents have attended a large number of funerals in the past month, but
the specific number is irrelevant to how much they worry about HIV/AIDS. Given that
on average, the number of funerals attended in the past month barely differs from the
lifetime number of acquaintances whom respondents suspect died of AIDS, a possible
explanation is that most deaths are not attributed to AIDS.
Social factors. Over half of women are older or approximately the same age as
their husbands, although the magnitude of the difference in spouses'ages is not related
to worry about HIV/AIDS for either sex. A large proportion of women earn an income,
but earning an income is not associated with worry. Most respondents are married, and
the percent married changes little from one wave to the next. However, this aggregate
stasis disguises more extensive marital change at the individual level. Based on
retrospective marital histories collected in 2001 and cross-checked against 1998 data,
14% of women and 18% of men experienced at least one marital dissolution or creation
between waves. The number of times respondents have been married is significantly
related to their worry about HIV/AIDS. Fewer men than women suspect their spouses
of infidelity. However, the difference may partially be due to differential reporting, as
men may feel greater pressure to say that their wives are faithful (Note 10). Approval
of using condoms with a spouse doubled between waves for both sexes.
The mean number of people rural Malawians report chatting with about HIV/AIDS
increased over time, suggesting that HIV/AIDS is still very much a topic of
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
296 http://www.demographic-research.org
conversation. Men report having spoken with slightly more people about HIV/AIDS
than women, and they have slightly more network partners in the first wave. The
number of network partners total that a person has does not significantly impact his
worry, but the number that are worried do. Similarly, if none of a respondent's
conversational partners worry about HIV/AIDS, then she, too, is less likely to worry.
Although women worry more about HIV/AIDS than do men, the two sexes' network
partners worry about the same amount according to the various measures. Just as
respondent worry declined for both men and women over time, so too did network-
partner worry despite an overall increase in the number of partners in respondents'
conversational networks.
Community markers serve as indicators of extended social networks, as well as
social environments that might impact experiences with HIV/AIDS. Men report being
slightly more religious than women, as measured by their attendance at religious
services. However, religiosity does not appear to be strongly associated with worry.
What relationship does exist suggests that women who are highly religious worry less
about HIV/AIDS.
3.2. Multivariate results
The results of the multivariate models are presented in Tables 3 through 6. Each
multivariate model consists of four regressions. The first is worry on individual factors
and controls only. The second is worry on individual factors, controls, and social
variables minus the network variables and region of residence. The third is worry on
individual factors and controls, plus all social variables except region. The final model
differs from the third in its inclusion of region. I split up the models with social
variables in this fashion in order to distinguish between the effects of social networks
and region on the other variables in the model. In the tables, the overall significance of
polytomous categorical variables--tests of the null hypothesis that all the dummy
coefficients are equal to zero--is indicated in the first line of variable results.

http://www.demographic-research.org 301
Looking at the results for the first set of models, which have only individual and
control variables, we see that certain individual factors are significantly related to
worry. The following variables are significant in at least one model: having engaged in
extramarital sex, having used condoms, where the husband usually stays, receiving
information about HIV/AIDS from multiple sources, the number of acquaintances that
died of AIDS, age, education, and wealth. To highlight a few of these relationships, in
some of the models, respondents who report having had extramarital sex in the past
year worry more about HIV/AIDS. The relationship between condom use and worry is
positive, suggesting that worry prompts condom use rather than the reverse, as the
model specifies. Knowing that you cannot tell someone's sero-status by their
appearance decreases worry, but having been exposed to information about HIV/AIDS
from multiple sources increases it. For men in 1998, knowing many people who died of
AIDS is associated with reduced rather than increased levels of worry, an unexpected
finding replicated by a Ugandan study that found that if a person knew more than 15
suspected AIDS victims, he was more likely than if he knew fewer to say that he was
certain he was HIV negative (Ntozi and Kirunga 1997). For men, age is positively
associated with worry (Note 11). Education is negatively associated with men's worry,
but positively associated with women's.
When the social variables minus the network variables and region are added to the
models, a number of individual variables cease being significant. Education ceases to
be significant in any model, as does condom use, the number suspected to have died of
AIDS, the wealth index, and knowing that a healthy-looking person can have AIDS.
Nonetheless, a few of the individual variables continue to be significant in some
models, and the overall pattern remains largely intact; specifically, behavior, as
indicated by having recently engaged in extramarital sex, and knowledge, as measured
by exposure to different sources of "expert" information about HIV/AIDS, are still
significantly related to respondent worry. In regards to social variables, especially for
women, being in a polygynous marriage and suspecting your spouse of infidelity are
associated with increased worry about HIV/AIDS. Research in Zimbabwe found that
divorced and separated women were more likely than currently married women to feel
at risk for contracting HIV/AIDS (Gregson et al. 1998), yet I find no consistent
differences between monogamously married and single respondents. Ethnicity is
significant in all of the models, and religious affiliation is significant in half.
Specifically, Catholics are not significantly different from Protestants, Revivalists, and
adherents to traditional religions, and Muslims worry more about HIV/AIDS than do
Christians.
Adding the network-partner variables to the models has a mixed effect on the
significance of the individual variables. Whereas the information variable drops out of
two of the four models in which it was previously significant, condom use and where
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
302 http://www.demographic-research.org
the husband usually stays become newly significant in two models. The extramarital
sex variable appears to have the most tenacious effect on worry of any individual
variable. Broadly speaking, the previously significant variables regarding one's spouse
remain significant, as do ethnicity and region in some models. That the other
significant variables remain largely unaffected suggests that while networks have a
large, significant effect on worry, that effect is largely independent of the effects of the
other variables in the models. In regards to the network effects themselves, as depicted
in Figures 2 and 3 (Note 12), for women in 1998 and men in 2001, the relationship
between respondent worry and the average level of worry in a respondent's network
depends on the number of people in that network. Specifically, the more numerous the
partners, the more closely the respondent's worry resembles that of his network
partners.

Region of residence is highly correlated with ethnicity, and to a lesser extent, religious
affiliation. Consequently, when we add region to the models, the biggest change is that
ethnicity ceases to be significant in three of the four models. The individual variable,
where the husband usually stays, becomes insignificant in the two models in which it
was previously marginally significant. The network coefficients change little, however,
suggesting that regional differences do not account for networks' strong effects on
worry. The relationship between region and worry is curiously inconsistent across time
and sex. Part of the explanation is divergent changes in regional levels of average
worry from one wave to the next. As illustrated in Table 7, while worry in Balaka
dropped precipitously for both sexes between 1998 and 2001, changes in worry in the
other two regions were smaller and inconsistent across sexes. Once we control for
social variables with which it is correlated, region has little explanatory power, as
indicated by the minimal increases in the pseudo R2 values when we add it to the
models.

The most notable finding to emerge from the multivariate models containing all the
variables, both individual and social, is the strong impact of network worry on
respondent worry. Not only is the significance across all four models remarkable, so,
too, are the large magnitudes of the effects. For example, according to the men's 1998
model, increasing average worry from not worried to moderately worried or from
moderately worried to very worried increases by a factor of six the odds that a
respondent is in a higher category of worry. Suspecting your spouse of infidelity also
stands out for its large and robust impact on respondent worry. Compared to
respondents who report that their spouses are probably faithful, those who suspect or
know of infidelity are between 2.7 and 3.1 times (depending on the model) more likely
to be in a higher category of worry. Respondents who "can't" or "don't" know if their
spouses are faithful or who report that their spouses pose the greatest threat for
transmitting HIV are between 1.4 and 3 times more worried about HIV/AIDS. It is also
worth noting that suspected infidelity has a greater effect on women's than men's worry
about HIV/AIDS, and more women than men doubt their spouses' fidelity.
The pseudo R2 statistic for ordered categories logistic regression is based on the
difference in the log-likelihoods for the fitted model and a model with no explanatory
variables (Allison 1999). While it cannot be interpreted as the proportion of variance
explained by the independent variables the way an OLS R2 can, it can be loosely
regarded as a measure of the extent to which a model's explanatory variables account
for observed differences in the dependent variable. The R2 statistics for the models
with only individual variables and controls range from 0.01 to 0.05, suggesting that
individual variables matter little when predicting respondents' worry about HIV/AIDS.
The values for the models with social variables minus the network variables and region
are at least three times as large as the R2 for the corresponding individual models. The
R2 statistic for the full model with the lowest predictive value is almost four times the
value for the individual model with the highest predictive value. Based on the
substantially higher R2 statistics for the models with social variables and the finding
that when I control for social variables in the models, individual variables are no longer
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 305
significant, I conclude that social factors have a greater influence on worry about
HIV/AIDS than do the individual factors included in this analysis. Variables related to
one's spouse and network-partner worry have the greatest and most robust impact on
respondent worry.
4. Discussion
Since it was learned that HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa is transmitted mostly
through heterosexual sex, researchers and interventionists have focused on individuals
under the assumption that, if Africans only had the necessary information and skills,
they would change their behaviors. In recent years, the focus has gradually shifted to
other, more macro-level factors like gender power imbalances, network influences, and
poverty. I contribute to the debate over whether this change in focus is appropriate by
evaluating the relative importance of individual versus social factors in contributing to
rural Malawians'worry about HIV/AIDS.
The overriding message that emerges from this analysis is that individual
characteristics and reported behaviors matter far less in determining worry about
HIV/AIDS than how much respondents' conversational partners worry and whether
they suspect their spouses of infidelity. This finding was remarkably consistent across
time and sex. People's concern rubs off on their friends such that, regardless of
whether or not a person is at risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, he is more likely to worry
about the disease if his friends are worried. Alternatively, we might suppose that, given
the uncertainty surrounding HIV/AIDS due to people's inability to tell if others--or
they, themselves--are infected, individuals look to those around them for clues as to
how they should feel and behave in the context of the epidemic. These clues may take
the form of information, or they may come by way of example. Yet the concerns of
those with whom a person regularly interacts are not the only factors that matter. Other
social variables, including ethnicity, region, and variables concerning one's spouse,
were also significantly related to respondent worry about AIDS. The individual
variable that had the largest, most robust effect on worry is reported engagement in
extramarital sex, which was positively associated with worry about HIV/AIDS. Yet
caution is called for in drawing conclusions from this finding, as it may be subject to
response bias. Given the illicit nature of infidelity, it is likely that respondents
underreported their extramarital sex, as suggested by a study from Malawi that used
biomarkers to validate reports of sexual activity (Taha et al. 1996). Studies that used
informal, in-depth qualitative interviewing to investigate whether extramarital sex is
underreported in the MDICP survey similarly concluded that infidelity is underreported,
although it is difficult to quantify to what extent (Tawfik 2003, Behrman et al. 2003).
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
306 http://www.demographic-research.org
Unfortunately, it is impossible to know whether respondents who admitted to having
extramarital sex are representative of the average person with extramarital partners.
While these findings of large, robust effects of social variables on worry do not
directly contradict the prevailing models of health behavior, which focus on individuals,
they do complicate them in interesting ways. According to a UNAIDS review of
theories of HIV/AIDS-related behavioral change, "Models of individual behavioral
change... generally do not consider the interaction of social, cultural, and environmental
issues as independent of individual factors" (UNAIDS 1999:6). One of the factors these
theories do consider is perceived risk, which they treat as a determinant of behavior:
"Although each theory is built on different assumptions they all state that behavioral
changes occur by altering potential risk-producing situations and social relationships,
risk perceptions, attitudes, self-efficacy beliefs, intentions and outcome expectations
[emphasis added]" (UNAIDS 1999:6). Although the association between worry and
perceived risk is imperfect, it is nonetheless strong. Consequently, my finding of a
strong social basis for worry calls into question these models' omission of a social
element. Other studies have similarly argued that theories of behavioral change that fail
to consider network and peer effects are inadequate (e.g., Vandlandingham et al. 1995,
UNAIDS 1999, Bunnell 1996). Thus, a more complete model of risk behavior must
take into account the social underpinnings of worry.
Another interesting finding to emerge from this study is that worry declined between
1998 and 2001 for both sexes. Evidence from rural Kenya has documented a similar
decline in that country (Watkins and Schatz 2001). The decline in worry evident in this
study was not due to unobserved heterogeneity since the MDICP as analyzed is a
longitudinal sample, so the same people were interviewed in both waves. It also cannot
be attributed to an age effect, as what little association exists between worry and age is
positive. That said, worry did not decline equally in all regions. In fact, women in the
central region and men in the north became slightly more worried about HIV/AIDS
over time. Additional research is needed to investigate why worry changed the way it
did in the different regions.
Another finding worth noting is that many of the variables that influence people's
levels of worry suggest a close correspondence between factors that epidemiologists
believe put people at risk and factors that are locally deemed risky (e.g., engaging in
extramarital sex, having an adulterous spouse). This correspondence may indicate that
both groups have independently picked up on the same real-world phenomena.
However, it could also reflect the possibility that respondents have absorbed
educational messages (e.g., unprotected sex is dangerous) disseminated by HIV/AIDS
prevention programs. Either way, this finding suggests that, if HIV/AIDS continues to
spread in Malawi, it is not for lack of awareness of the relevant risk factors. Additional
support for this conclusion is weakly (because it concerns data from another country)
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 307
provided by a recent Ugandan study that found that determinants of perceived risk of
HIV infection are also known risk factors for contracting HIV/AIDS. Moreover,
patterns of sex-specific perceived risk mirror differences in actual sero-prevalence
(Kengeya-Kayondo et al. 1999).
There are a number of limitations to this study. First, I conclude that, since few of
the individual variables analyzed are significantly related to worry, and the models with
individual variables only have low R2s, individual factors must not be important
determinants of worry about HIV/AIDS. However, strictly speaking, this would only
be the case if I had observations without measurement error for all the individual
variables of interest. Of course, I have neither: there are many potentially important
individual variables (e.g., risk aversion, tendency to discount the future) for which I
have no data, and other variables for which I do have information may be measured
poorly. The cross-sectional nature of the data as analyzed exacerbates the problem
because the effects of potentially endogenous variables such as condom use, which may
both affect and be affected by worry about infection, will be biased downwards.
Moreover, even if social variables have as large an effect on worry as I suggest, the low
R2s for the models with social variables mean that individual factors may as yet have a
sizeable, albeit unobserved, effect on worry.
Overall, it is important to emphasize that mine is not a direct test of the
comparative validity of the different types of models. Such an analysis is beyond the
scope of this article because I lack data on many of the relevant factors. Rather, this is a
more general test of what constructs matters, and which matter more--individual,
cognitive-behavioral factors, or social and environmental factors. The finding that
social factors, and in particular, network factors predominate is less a negation of the
validity of individual, psychosocial models than it is a demonstration of the importance
of social and environmental factors operating independently of individual factors.
Another limitation of this study is that the generalizability of my findings to
Malawi on the whole or to other populations in sub-Saharan Africa is questionable due
to restrictions placed on the sample that render it potentially unrepresentative. These
include limiting the original sample to ever-married women and their husbands,
dropping respondents interviewed in one wave only, and dropping respondents who
reported never having discussed AIDS with others or who were unable to report the
level of worry of at least one conversant. While these restrictions may limit the
generalizability of the conclusions to other populations within or outside Malawi,
analyses conducted by the author (not shown) and by Bignami-Van Assche et al. (2003)
suggest that they did not bias the results for the population studied.
A third limitation stems from my decision to use worry as a proxy for perceived
risk. As noted, although they are similar, the two concepts are not identical. While the
emotive component implicit in worry may be viewed as rendering it superior to
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
308 http://www.demographic-research.org
perceived risk as a predictor of behavioral change, to the extent that predictors of worry
are dissimilar from predictors of perceived risk as a result of this additional component,
my conclusions regarding perceived risk--the concept explicitly referred to in most
individual models of risk behavior--are invalid. For example, due to personality
differences such as differential propensities for risk aversion, individuals with the same
perceived risk of infection may express varying levels of worry about HIV/AIDS.
Differential exposure to other stressors or ability to manage stress may produce a
similar effect. Unobservables such as these, which are related to worry but not
perceived risk, may introduce bias not accounted for in the present analysis. While one
could argue that worry is interesting to investigate in its own right, this potential bias is
problematic for my conclusions regarding the salience of social factors in predicting
behavioral change within the framework of existing models of health behavior.
The final limitation has to do with the finding of strong network effects on
respondent worry. The network questions were designed to gage how worried are the
people with whom respondents discuss HIV/AIDS. If respondents projected their own
concerns onto their network partners rather than accurately reporting their partners'
feelings, they violated the basic premise of the exercise. Yet this is a real possibility,
and to the extent that projected concern accounts for the observed association between
respondent worry and network-partner worry, the results are biased. A second potential
problem is that of network endogeneity: do people intentionally choose as network
partners others who think or behave the way they do, or in this case, who worry about
HIV/AIDS to the same extent that they do? Research on fertility networks indicates
that respondents typically choose network partners based on similarities across a
multitude of characteristics rather than just one (Warriner and Watkins 2000).
Nevertheless, network endogeneity stemming from selectivity and unobserved
heterogeneity is still a troubling possibility.
Caveats notwithstanding, an Australian study on the determinants of perceived risk
found similar evidence of strong network effects, concluding "Perceived personal risk
was influenced most by perceived risk to friends and to people with the same sexual
practices" (Timmins et al. 1998). Providing further support, albeit indirect, numerous
studies in sub-Saharan Africa have documented the successes of peer-led intervention
programs (e.g., Mouli 1992, Williams and Ray 1993). My finding of a strong network
effect on respondent worry may help account for these successes, as people who are
worried about HIV/AIDS should be more willing to take precautions to protect
themselves against infection. Lastly, mounting evidence from the family planning
literature suggests that networks matter even after controlling for unobserved factors
that may influence both the selection of partners and the adoption of contraception,
lending credence to the independent effects of networks on behaviors (e.g.,
Montgomery, Casterline, and Heiland 2001, Behrman, Kohler, and Watkins 2002). An
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 9
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 309
analysis that used fixed effects and instrumental variables to control for the possibility
of non-random selection similarly found that effects of networks on worry about AIDS
are robust to these controls (Kohler, Behrman, and Watkins 2002).
While the importance of social-structural variables to behavioral change has been
demonstrated by past research, comparatively little attention has been focused on
predictors of a critical component of health behavior, perceived risk. I contribute to the
debate on the determinants of behavioral change by analyzing the relative importance of
individual versus social factors in accounting for levels of worry in a high-prevalence
population in sub-Saharan Africa. As such, I find support for the increasingly popular
notion that social influence must be incorporated into our understanding of how and
why people change their behavior in response to HIV/AIDS.

Notes
1. The AIDS Risk Reduction model also incorporates elements of Diffusion of
Innovation theory (UNAIDS 1999).
2. Values for current perceived risk are answers to a question regarding the
"likelihood or chance that [the respondent] is infected with HIV/AIDS now."
Possible answers were "no likelihood," "low," "medium," "high," and "don't
know." Respondents who did not answer "high" were then asked to evaluate the
likelihood of future infection.
3. Survey questions were written in English and then translated into three local
languages used to conduct the interviews: Chichewa, Yao, and Tumbuka.
4. To account for the likelihood that some respondents never used condoms because
they perceive their risk of HIV infection to be negligible, I tested for interactions in
the second wave between condom use and both current and cumulative risk.
Because neither interaction was significantly related to worry, they were dropped
from the model.
5. Unfortunately, because this question refers to the previous year, newlyweds may
have included premarital partners in their answers.
6. Because so few respondents (four in total) reported that the risk of infection associated
with a single episode of unprotected sex with an infected partner is zero, I combined
the corresponding response category with the next lowest category, "low." The true
likelihood of infection given one act of unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner
is less than ½ of one percent (Bracher, Santow, and Watkins 2003).
7. Treating the number of funerals attended in the past month as indicative of
perceived severity or prevalence of AIDS assumes that respondents attribute the
majority of local deaths to AIDS, which qualitative data suggest they do.
8. My intent in including a variable for self-employment in the women's models is to
assess whether the data support a hypothesis common in the literature rather than to
promote that hypothesis or suggest that it is the only reason we should expect to
find a relationship between women's paid work and worry about HIV/AIDS. It is
equally plausible that women who work are compelled to do so because their
husbands spend their earnings on girlfriends or are too ill to themselves work,
yielding a positive association between women's employment and worry.
9. Answers of "don't know" were excluded from calculations.

10. Studies (e.g., Njovana and Watts 1996) proclaim that while it is considered
acceptable in sub-Saharan Africa for men to engage in extramarital sex, husbands
are expected to divorce adulterous wives. Consequently, a man who stays with an
unfaithful wife may feel pressured to lie about her infidelity.
11. An age-squared term used to test for nonlinear relationships between age and worry
was not significant in any of the models, so it was dropped.
12. The graphs depict average predicted values calculated using the equation,
log[Fij
/(1-Fij
)] = xi1
+ xi2
+ xi3
, where xi1
is average value of network-partner
worry for individual i, xi2
is the number of AIDS network partners for individual i,
xi3
is the value of the interaction term for individual i (average worry * number of
partners), and Fij
is the probability that individual i is in the jth category or higher.
