Will the `Principles of Effectiveness' improve
prevention practice? Early findings from a
diffusion study
D. Hallfors and D. Godette
Abstract
This study examines adoption and implementa-
tion of the US Department of Education's new
policy, the `Principles of Effectiveness', from a
diffusion of innovations theoretical framework.
In this report, we evaluate adoption in relation to
Principle 3: the requirement to select research-
based programs. Results from a sample of 104
school districts in 12 states indicate that many
districts appear to be selecting research-based
curricula, but that the quality of implementation
is low. Only 19% of the responding district
coordinators indicated that schools were imple-
menting a research-based curriculum with
fidelity. Common problems included lack of
teacher training, lack of requisite materials, use
of some but not all of the required lessons and
teaching strategies, and failure to deliver lessons
to age-appropriate student groups. This study
represents the first attempt to assess the quality
of implementation of research-based programs
as required by the Principles of Effectiveness.
We conclude that low levels of funding, inad-
equate infrastructure, decentralized decision
making and lack of program guidance have
contributed to the slow progress in improving
school-based prevention.

Introduction
A critical issue in substance abuse prevention is
the gap between what is known to be effective and
what is actually being done in practice. The primary
context for providing substance abuse prevention
education to adolescents has been through the
schools (Ellickson, 1995). The US Department of
Education provides the largest single source of
federal prevention funding through its Safe and
Drug Free Schools (SDFS) program (US Depart-
ment of Education, 1998b). A new Department of
Education policy has created an opportunity to
close the gap by increasing research-based sub-
stance abuse prevention education in schools. The
new policy requires school districts to follow the
`Principles of Effectiveness' or run the risk of
losing their SDFS funding. The potential impact
of the policy is significant since almost all school
districts in the country currently receive such
funding (US Department of Education, 2000).
The new policy requires school districts to: (1)
conduct needs assessments, (2) set measurable
objectives, (3) choose research-based programs
and (4) evaluate progress towards objectives (US
Department of Education, 1998b). The present
paper focuses on data from the first of two success-
ive district surveys aimed at evaluating the impact
of the policy. For this report, only the third Principle
of Effectiveness, the requirement to choose
research-based programs, will be assessed.
The Department of Education's non-regulatory
guidance instructs grantees to `design and imple-
ment its programs for youth based on research or
evaluation that provides evidence that the programs
D. Hallfors and D. Godette
used prevent or reduce drug use, violence or
disruptive behavior among youth' [(US Department
of Education, 1998a), p. 1]. This study examines
whether school districts appear to be meeting this
standard in their choice of prevention curricula.
Further, it examines the quality of implementation
among those that report choosing research-based
programs.
The policy represents an innovation, i.e. a new
process of selecting school-based prevention pro-
grams, based on rational planning. Adoption is the
decision to make full use of an innovation as the
best course of action (Rogers, 1995). If the policy
is successful and school districts are adopting
the Principles, we expect that they are selecting
research-based programs and dropping programs
that have not shown evidence of effective preven-
tion. Implementation occurs when the organization
actually puts the innovation into use. Important
aspects of prevention program implementation
include teacher training, and the use of specified
lesson plans and teaching methods (Smith et al.,
1995; Hansen and McNeal, 1999). Since the ulti-
mate goal of the policy is to improve prevention
practices in school districts, it is important to assess
key issues in the selection process, the programs
districts are choosing and the quality of their
implementation.
Despite a concentrated effort over the past
decade by federal agencies to promote effective
prevention strategies (National Institute on Drug
Abuse, 1997; Center for Substance Abuse Preven-
tion, 2000; Division of Adolescent and School
Health, 2000), schools have continued to select
heavily marketed curricula that have not been
evaluated, have been evaluated inadequately or
have been shown to be ineffective in reducing
substance use (Rohrbach et al., 1996; Tobler and
Stratton, 1997; Swisher, 2000). Schools have also
commonly relied on untested `homegrown' preven-
tion curricula (Hansen and McNeal, 1999). The
Department of Education's new policy thus repres-
ents a bold attempt to change the way districts
choose programs, with an embedded financial
incentive for compliance.

Theoretical framework
Diffusion theory provides a useful framework for
evaluating the impact of this policy. Diffusion is
the process by which members of a social system
learn about, decide about and act on ideas, practices
or objects that they perceive as new (Rogers,
1995). The diffusion of innovations in schools has
been characterized as a four-stage process: (1)
dissemination, or planned efforts to make school
districts aware of a program and encourage its
adoption; (2) adoption, or the encouragement of
districts to make a commitment to initiate a pro-
gram; (3) implementation, or interventions to assist
teachers or other appropriate personnel to deliver
the program in accordance with its original design;
and (4) maintenance, or the encouragement of
school administrators and teachers to continue
using the program (Rohrbach et al., 1996).
This paper reports on information related to
adoption and early implementation of one aspect
of the Principles of Effectiveness. The policy was
enacted in July 1998 and data were gathered
in Fall 1999. Given that school districts have
traditionally not used rational planning in selecting
curricula and that there are more than 13 000
school districts in the US, we assumed that this
assessment would represent a relatively early point
in the diffusion process. Other studies have shown
that schools have difficulty implementing research-
based strategies, even under the most supportive
conditions (Gottfredson, 1997; Hansen and
McNeal, 1999). Our intent was to assess whether
the policy had actually begun to prompt selection
of research-based programs and, if so, how well
they were being implemented.
Several diffusion theory constructs are particu-
larly salient for the present analyses. First, diffusion
theory suggests that preventive innovations are
slow to be adopted, because individuals have
difficulty perceiving their relative advantage
(Rogers, 1995). Relative advantage refers to the
economic and social rewards that are thought
to follow adoption of an innovation. Prevention
rewards tend to be distant in time and there
is uncertainty whether prevention activities are
Diffusion study
actually needed (i.e. maybe students would not
use drugs even without the program). Financial
incentives can help to increase relative advantage
and the Department of Education's policy provides
an incentive for adoption. If districts do not adopt
the Principles of Effectiveness, they risk losing
their longstanding SDFS funding. On average,
schools receive about $6/student/year; because
most school districts are small, almost 60% receive
less than $10 000/year (Modzeleski, 1999). Large
districts can receive substantially more and, based
on state-determined criteria of need, certain dis-
tricts receive larger per pupil allocations ($12).
Although funding allocations may be relatively
small, many districts report that their prevention
efforts rely heavily on SDFS funding, which is by
far their largest source of drug abuse prevention
funding (Hantman and Crosse, 2000).
Incentives are useful, but can be a double-edged
sword. Incentives can increase the rate of adoption,
and motivate individuals and organizations that
would otherwise not adopt, but commitment to
the decision may be low, limiting the intended
consequences of adoption (Rogers, 1995). For
example, when districts select effective curricula,
they may not purchase adequate curricula materials
or they may neglect to train teachers in essential
methods for effectively teaching the curricula
(Smith et al., 1995). Teachers, in turn, may only
teach a portion of the lesson plans, resulting in an
insufficient `dose' to students (Pentz and Trebow,
1991; Drug Strategies, 1999). Given the issues
associated with relative advantage, we hypothes-
ized that there would be widespread adoption of
the Principles and evidence that school districts
were selecting research-based programs, but that
initial implementation would be of poor quality.
Compatability is a related diffusion construct
that can also influence the adoption of effective
prevention programs. Compatibility indicates the
degree to which the innovation is consistent with
existing values, past experiences and needs of
potential adopters (Rogers, 1995). If the innovation
is perceived as an extreme change, then it will not
be compatible with past experiences and will be
slow to diffuse. School districts are known to base
463
their prevention decisions on compatibility with
past experiences and satisfaction with programs
already in place (Hantman and Crosse, 2000).
Since programs such as the DARE program have
long enjoyed widespread name recognition and
community support, we expected that districts
would be slow to replace DARE and other familiar
programs.
Complexity is another construct that can influ-
ence the diffusion process. Innovations that are
relatively more complex are less likely to be
adopted, and more likely to be re-invented and
simplified if adopted (Rogers, 1995). Re-invention
of prevention curricula often results in a lowered
dose (i.e. reducing the number or content of lesson
plans) and has generally been found to decrease
effects in prevention science (Pentz, 1994; Botvin
et al., 1995). Positive program effects are attributed
to carefully crafted activities linked to theories of
moderators and mediators of behavior (MacKinnon
et al., 1991), and re-invention may occur because
of lack of knowledge about the concepts underlying
the prevention activity (Hansen and McNeal,
1999). We hypothesized that complex prevention
programs would be less likely to be adopted and
more frequently re-invented than simpler curricula-
based programs.
Methods
Sample
A mailed questionnaire was sent to the SDFS
coordinators in 104 districts in 12 states and
the District of Columbia. Sample districts were
selected because of their location in communities
participating in an existing study (Hallfors et al.,
1997; Saxe et al., 1997). A total of 81 district
coordinators (78%) in 11 states responded to the
survey. As can be seen in Table I, our sample of 81
school districts has a much greater representation of
large, urban districts, than the country as a whole.
Districts responding to the survey did not differ
from non-responders on either size or urbanicity.
Measurement and data collection
A survey was developed to capture key constructs
of diffusion theory predicting innovation adoption.

aBased on data obtained from the US Department of
Education's Common Core of Data (1997­1998).
In order to test convergent validity, the instrument
contained questions (including questions 2­6,
below) from a separate study that achieved a
nationally representative sample of school districts
(Ringwalt et al., 2000). The survey was reviewed
for construct validity by diffusion experts and also
tested for reliability through a series of cognitive
interviews with school district coordinators who
were not included in the sample. Cognitive inter-
views encourage respondents to think out loud,
prompted by probes to determine whether questions
are understood and measure the construct as inten-
ded (Sudman et al., 1996).
Responses to a subset of survey questions were
analyzed for the present report. These questions
included:
(1) When did you start working to implement the
Principles of Effectiveness (more than 1 year
ago, more than 1 month but less than 1 year,
have not started yet but will soon, do not
plan to)?
(2) In your district, how much input does each
of the following persons or groups have in
selecting your substance abuse curricula (a
great deal of input, some input, not too much
input, no input)?
(3) In your school district, can individual schools
decide whether or not they will implement
specific substance use prevention programs
(yes, no)?
(4) Which, if any, of the following substance use
prevention curricula, available commercially
or because of participation in a research study,
464
does your district use (responses described
below)?
(5) Has your district adapted or combined any of
the above curricula for use within your school
district (yes, no)?
(6) Does your district use a written substance use
prevention curriculum (or set of materials) that
was developed locally by your state, county,
school district or one of your schools (yes, no)?
Response categories for the fourth question
included a comprehensive list of 59 curricula
compiled and reviewed by a private non-profit
research institute, Drug Strategies (Drug Strategies,
1999). District coordinators could select more than
one curriculum from the list. Since curricula are
implemented at the school level, it is possible that
different schools in the same district use different
programs. In addition, curricula are grade-specific,
so we expected that districts would use different
programs for elementary, middle and high school.
Six programs on the curricula list were consid-
ered to be research-based, having been evaluated
in one or more randomized control trials. These
programs were: Alcohol Misuse Prevention Pro-
gram (Dielman et al., 1989), Life Skills Training
Program (Botvin et al., 1995), Project ALERT
(Ellickson and Bell, 1990), Project STAR or
I-STAR (Pentz et al., 1989), Reconnecting Youth
(Eggert et al., 1994) and Project Northland (Perry
et al., 1996). If any of the sampled SDFS district
coordinators reported use of one or more of the
six curricula, we conducted a follow-up telephone
interview with the coordinator, using a standard
protocol. In many cases (38% of contacts), we
spoke with a teacher or another person in the district
to whom the coordinator referred us, because that
person had more direct knowledge about program
implementation. The interviewer probed for (1)
confirmation that the program was the actual pro-
gram of interest, (2) teacher access to official
curriculum and materials, (3) teacher use of curric-
ulum and the extent to which he or she followed
program protocols, (4) teacher training in the use
of the curriculum, and (4) program delivery at the
appropriate grade level.
Diffusion study
All of the research-based programs have a pub-
lished curriculum with a set number of lesson
plans that include exercises for student interaction.
All require teacher training for proper implementa-
tion. Three of the six programs, however, are
more complex than the others, since they include
essential elements that go beyond these basic
features. The three programs are Project STAR,
Project Northland and Reconnecting Youth. Project
STAR and Project Northland are comprehensive
programs, with required features such as mass-
media events, parent activities and community
organizing to augment the school-based curricula.
Reconnecting Youth is a program for high-risk
students, which requires schools to use specific
criteria to identify eligible students and to identify
teachers with special characteristics to teach the
class. In contrast, the other programs were designed
for all students at a given grade level. The inter-
viewer asked additional questions for the three
complex programs, related to specific components.
For example, the interviewer asked how students
were identified and invited to participate in Recon-
necting Youth.
All aspects of the research plan were reviewed
and approved by the Institutional Review Board.
Results
Selection of prevention programs
Since only 59 (73%) of the 81 coordinators that
completed the questionnaire reported that they
had received information about the Principles of
Effectiveness, all but one of the others appro-
priately skipped the question `When did you start
working to implement the Principles of Effect-
iveness?'. Of those that responded to this question,
only one indicated that they had no plans to
implement the Principles of Effectiveness. Thirty-
eight coordinators (63%) reported that they had
been working on implementation for more than
1 year, 12 (20%) during the past year and nine
(15%) had `not started yet, but will soon'.
All other study questions were answered by all
respondents. In response to the question `In your
465
district, how much input does each of the following
persons or groups have in selecting your substance
abuse curricula', 70% indicated that the coordinator
themselves had `a great deal of input' in selection,
compared to district-level substance use advisory
groups (39%), classroom teachers (31%), district
administrators (26%), school principals (24%),
district school boards (16%), community coalitions
(10%) and students or parents (8% each). Neverthe-
less, individual schools decided whether they
would implement specific substance abuse preven-
tion programs in over half (53%) of the districts.
When asked to select the curricula that their
district was using, most respondents checked more
than one program from the list (range  1­20;
mean  6). Table II lists the programs that were
checked by at least 10% of study districts. As can
be seen, more than half of the sample checked
each of three programs--DARE, Here's Looking
at You, and McGruff Drug Prevention and Child
Protection. All three programs have been commer-
cially marketed, with a long history (10­15 years)
of development and dissemination. Forty-eight
coordinators (59%) reported use of one or more
of the six research-based programs in district
schools, although none reported use of either
Project Northland or the Alcohol Misuse Preven-
tion Program.
Finally, 53% of school coordinators who
responded to the survey said that they were using
locally developed curricula or materials that were
not on the survey list. Fifty-two percent of respond-
ents indicated that they had adapted or combined
curricula from the list.
Implementation of research-based
programs
Follow-up telephone calls were made to the 48
coordinators that checked one or more of the
research-based programs. Since some districts
checked more than one program, the total number
of possible interviews was 84. Fifty-eight inter-
views (69%) were completed (see results in Tables
III­VI). As can be seen in the tables, coordinators
often reported that they were not actually currently

using any of the effective curricula. Only a few of
the coordinators or secondary informants could
confirm that district teachers engaged in quality
implementation of the programs. Common quality
problems included lack of teacher training, lack of
requisite materials for every class and lack of
student exposure to the entire (or even majority
of) the curriculum (see Tables III­VI). In some
cases, curricula were used at the wrong grade
level or in alternative schools rather than regular
classrooms.
Discussion
Our findings supported two of our three hypotheses.
First, we expected that most districts would recog-
466
nize the relative advantage of adopting the Prin-
ciples, that they would begin selecting research-
based programs, but that many would implement
them with low quality. Indeed, almost every coord-
inator that knew about the Principles indicated that
they had adopted them and the majority of these
coordinators reported that they had been working
on implementation for 1 year or more. In relation
to Principle 3, the majority indicated that they
were selecting one or more research-based pro-
grams from our list; coordinators usually selected
the research-based programs along with several
other programs that were not research-based.
Follow-up telephone interviews, however, showed
that implementation quality of research-based pro-
grams was generally poor.
Second, we expected that well-known programs
such as DARE would be used more frequently
than research-based programs, because they are
compatible with past practices. The data supported
this assumption even more strongly than anticip-
ated. Two programs appear to be most prominent
in school districts: DARE and Here's Looking at
You. Unfortunately, neither is supported by peer-
reviewed evaluation studies (Hallfors et al., 2001).
DARE has been widely studied and found to have
relatively small short-term effects with no long-
term benefits on substance use behavior (Ennett
et al., 1994; Clayton et al., 1996); Here's Looking
at You has never been rigorously tested. DARE, in
particular, has observable qualities, i.e. uniformed
police officers, bumper stickers, tee-shirts and
related paraphernalia that facilitated its rapid dif-
fusion (Rogers, 1995). Both programs have been
heavily marketed, and closely aligned with `preven-
tion principles' (National Institute on Drug Abuse,
1997) and requirements of the SDFS policy.
In contrast, the programs that have been rigor-
ously tested and found to be effective have been
much slower to diffuse. Most of the research-based
programs have not been marketed to the same
extent as commercial programs. Two of the six
that were included in the survey were not used by
any of the 81 districts. A third, Project STAR, was
actually used in only one or two districts and not
faithfully implemented. Both Project STAR and

Project Northland have been under continued
development and testing, and are only now begin-
ning to be marketed. Two programs did appear to
have substantial market penetration: Life Skills
and Project Alert. Both curricula are universal
programs aimed at middle schools, which appears
to be the most popular venue for prevention pro-
gramming.
Finally, we expected that more complex pro-
grams would be re-invented, but there was no
consistent pattern supporting this assumption. All
of the programs were heavily modified by schools
and individual teachers. The exception was Life
Skills Training, which was reported to be faithfully
implemented by most of the districts that confirmed
they actually used the program.
Given these results, what are the implications
for closing the gap between science and practice?
On balance, it appears that the policy, with its
incentive, has mobilized school districts to recon-
sider their process for selecting prevention pro-
grams. Districts lacked guidance, however, in
choosing research-based programs. The US Depart-
ment of Education convened an expert panel in
1998 to review program effectiveness and provide
such guidance, but their report was not released
until January 2001, well after our survey. Change
agent effort is known to be a predictor in the rate
of diffusion (Rogers, 1995) and the lack of federal
guidance may have been an important contributor
to the poor implementation of Principle 3.
One example of how federal guidance and
consistent reinforcement can lead to the selection
468
of research-based programs is Life Skills. Life
Skills is a familiar name on every federal agency's
model substance abuse programs list and it is also
included on the US Department of Education's list
of exemplary programs. Some agencies, such as
the Office of Juvenile Justice, have even provided
support to school districts to implement the pro-
gram faithfully (Mihalic and Elliott, 2001). This
effort appears to have paid off with findings that
Life Skills was the most commonly selected of the
research-based programs and the best implemented.
Another diffusion problem may be the decentral-
ized decision making in school districts. Although
coordinators have great input in the selection of
prevention programs, schools can often make their
own decisions about the prevention programs that
they will implement. Rogers (Rogers, 1995) notes
that decentralized systems tend to lack quality
controls for effective diffusion. A related problem
is the relatively low funding for prevention.
Although half of our sample districts were large,
telephone interviews indicated that a well-organ-
ized central infrastructure to select, disseminate and
monitor the quality of substance abuse prevention
implementation was rare.
The present study has several notable limitations.
First, the sample is not representative of school
districts in the US; large school districts are over-
represented. Small and rural schools make up the
majority of districts in this country, and such
districts were less likely to know about the Prin-
ciples of Effectiveness or have a dedicated (more
than 25% time) substance abuse prevention coord-
Diffusion study
inator (Hallfors et al., 2000). Small and rural
districts also receive considerably less funding for
substance abuse prevention. Large districts make
up only 6% of districts, but they serve 50% of
school children in the US, giving some justification
for our over sample of large districts. Moreover,
our findings on popular curricula are supported by
a similar study that did achieve a population-based
sample of school districts (Ringwalt et al., 2000).
Another limitation was the difficulty in reaching
coordinators for telephone follow-up. Data were
incomplete despite repeated contacts to coordina-
tors by telephone and E-mail (average of six
contacts for each completed interview). Of the 84
interviews that we attempted to conduct across the
four research-based programs, only 58 (69%) were
actually conducted. Finally, an important limitation
was the reliance on reports of the coordinator.
Ideally, we would have made site visits to observe
prevention programming in all district schools, but
such methods were beyond the scope of the study.
Although imperfect, district-level substance abuse
coordinators are the most knowledgeable informa-
tion source about prevention curricula. Data collec-
tion was strengthened by including interviews with
staff closer to the actual implementation of specific
programs (e.g. teachers), whenever possible. Given
the findings of previous investigators (Hansen and
McNeal, 1997; Ennett and Burrit, 2000), we expect
that our 19% estimate of districts faithfully imple-
menting effective curricula is optimistic.
Despite the limitations, this study is the first
attempt to assess the quality of implementation of
research-based programs by school districts, in
relation to the new Department of Education policy.
Study findings were assessed at an early stage of
policy diffusion. The next phase of the study will
query the same sample of coordinators almost
3 years after policy implementation. If no further
progress is observed, then it is doubtful that the
policy will achieve the stated goals related to use
of effective programs. Given the low levels of
