Abstract
Introduction: We assessed the characteristics of adolescents and young adults who received tobacco direct mail materials and
the association of receiving these materials with subsequent smoking behaviors.
Methods: Adolescents from the upper Midwest region of the United States were sampled through clustered random sampling in
2000 and surveyed every 6 months. Participants (n = 3546) were asked at baseline (October 2006­March 2007) whether they had
received direct mail materials from tobacco companies during the previous 6 months. Smoking behaviors were assessed 6 months
later (April­September 2007). We assessed associations between demographics and receiving tobacco direct mail materials at
baseline and the association of receiving these materials with smoking behaviors at follow-up, stratified by baseline smoking status.
Results: Overall, 5.2% of nonsmokers and 23.9% of current smokers in our sample received tobacco direct mail materials
during the past 6 months (2.6% and 17.1% among nonsmokers and smokers <18 years old, respectively; p < .05). Participants
who were older and living with smokers were more likely to receive these materials (p < .05). Baseline nonsmokers who
received these materials smoked more cigarettes during the previous 30 days at follow-up (p < .05); baseline current smokers
who received these materials were less likely than those who did not to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked during the past
30 days at follow up (p < .05).
Conclusions: Those younger than 18 years old (particularly smokers) in addition to older individuals in our regional sample were
exposed to tobacco direct mail marketing. Exposure to this market strategy is associated with faster escalation of cigarette consump-
tion among nonsmokers and lower likelihood of smoking reduction among smokers in this adolescent and young adult sample.
Introduction
Tobacco use remains an important public health issue in ado-
lescents and young adults: 19.5% of 9th­12th graders reported
current smoking in 2009, and 34.2% of young adults (ages
18­25) reported current smoking in 2010 (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2012). Tobacco marketing has
been shown to be associated with adolescent smoking and adult
cigarette consumption (Biener & Siegel, 2000; National Cancer
Institute, 2008). Direct mail marketing is one of the advertis-
ing strategies used by the tobacco companies. Since the 1998
Master Settlement Agreement restricted tobacco companies'
ability to advertise their products in major media channels (e.g.,
newspaper, magazines, billboards), direct mail has been the only
media channel that showed an increase in cigarette advertising
expenditure. According to the Federal Trade Commission, the
expenditures on cigarette direct mail marketing increased from
about US$37 million in 1997, to about US$133 million in 2001
(a 359% leap from 1997), and to about $51 million in 2011 (a
138% increase from 1997; these figures did not include costs
for coupon redemption or gifts included in the mail) (Federal
Trade Commission, 2013; Lewis, Yulis, Delnevo, & Hrywna,
2004). Receiving tobacco direct mail materials (e.g., coupons,
advertisements, etc.) could have an impact on adolescents' and
young adults' smoking behaviors. For example, direct mail
coupons can induce experimentation with smoking among non-
smokers and shape repeated purchase behavior among current
smokers (Rothschild & Gaidis, 1981). Given that 99% of smok-
ers initiate smoking and become daily smokers before the age
of 30 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012),
it is important to examine the influence of tobacco direct mail
marketing in adolescents and young adults.
Little is known about prevalence and characteristics of ado-
lescents and young adults who receive tobacco direct mail mate-
rials. One study found that 4.9% of 12- to 17-year-olds reported
ever receiving direct mail materials from tobacco companies,

and ever receiving these materials was associated with current
smoking (Altman, Levine, Coeytaux, Slade, & Jaffe, 1996). The
proportion of adolescents currently receiving tobacco direct
mail materials is unknown. Another study showed that 15.2%
of young adults (aged 18­24) reported receiving tobacco direct
mail materials in the past 6 months but did not report charac-
teristics of young adults who received these materials. (Lewis,
Delnevo, & Slade, 2004). The prospective effect of receiving
tobacco direct mail materials on subsequent smoking behav-
iors among adolescents and young adults has not been previ-
ously examined. We used longitudinal data from the Minnesota
Adolescent Community Cohort (MACC) study to examine
characteristics associated with receipt of tobacco direct mail
materials and its influence on subsequent smoking behaviors
among adolescent and young adult nonsmokers and smokers.
Methods
Study Population
The MACC study is a population-based prospective cohort
study designed to further the understanding of the transitional
process from nonsmoking to smoking during adolescence and
to assess the effect of state- and local-level tobacco preven-
tion and control programs on adolescents and young adults in
Minnesota. The design of the study has been detailed elsewhere
(Forster, Chen, Perry, Oswald, & Willmorth, 2011). Briefly,
participants were selected in 2000­2001 and 2001­2002 from
60 randomly selected Minnesota geopolitical units (GPUs) and
5 GPUs from four comparison states (North and South Dakota,
Michigan, and Kansas). Clearwater Research, Inc. used modi-
fied random digit dialing and a combination of probability and
quota sampling methods to achieve an even distribution of ado-
lescents from ages 12 to 16.
Of the eligible households, 3,636 participants in Minnesota
and 605 participants in comparison states were recruited
between 2000 and 2001 (recruitment rates of 58.5% and
58.3%, respectively). An additional cohort of 585 twelve-year-
olds in Minnesota from the 60 previously randomly selected
Minnesota GPUs was sampled and recruited using the same
random digit dialing method during 2001­2002 (a recruit-
ment rate of 63.6%), resulting in an overall sample of 4,826.
Participants were surveyed periodically through 2011 using
computer-assisted telephone interviews. In this analysis, we
included participants who completed round 13 data collec-
tion (baseline for this analysis, conducted between October
2006 and March 2007, n = 3,526; response rate = 73.1% of the
original cohort; 81.9% of those eligible for round 13 survey).
Of these participants, 3,126 also completed round 14 data col-
lection (follow-up for this analysis, conducted between April
and September 2007; retention rate = 88.6%). Participants who
were lost to follow-up were more likely to be from racial/ethnic
minority groups, have lower education, and be heavier smok-
ers (p < .01). We included participants residing in other states
as well as Minnesota in the analysis because they did not dif-
fer in the prevalence of receiving tobacco direct mail materials
(p = .68). The University of Minnesota Institutional Review
Board approved this study. Participants (and their guardians
if less than age 18) provided consent before completing the
interviews, and monetary incentives ($10 for those aged 17 or
under, $15 for those aged 18 or older) were provided.
Measures
Participants were asked at baseline if they had received an
advertisement, a gift, or a coupon in the mail from a tobacco
company in the past 6 months (yes/no). We assessed partici-
pants' age, gender, race/ethnicity, and education at baseline,
and participants reported whether they lived with a smoker and
whether they had friends who smoke. Participants were asked
the number of days they smoked in the past 30 days and num-
ber of cigarettes smoked on the days they smoked in the past
30 days both at baseline and follow-up. Those who reported
smoking at least 1 day in the past 30 days at baseline were
classified as current smokers, and those who did not smoke
in the past 30 days at baseline were classified as nonsmok-
ers. Baseline current smokers were further dichotomized into
whether they smoked >15 days in the past 30 days (yes/no). We
derived the number of packs of cigarettes smoked in the past
30 days at baseline and follow-up by multiplying the number
of days smoked in the past 30 days and number of cigarettes
smoked on the days they smoked and divided the product by
20. Among baseline smokers, we subtracted the number of
packs of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at baseline from
that at follow-up. Participants with a negative difference were
classified as having reduced the number of packs of cigarettes
smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
We assessed the characteristics associated with receiving
tobacco direct mail materials at baseline by including age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education, living with a smoker, having
friends who smoke, and "smoked more than 15 days in the past
30 days" among baseline current smokers in logistic regres-
sion models, stratified by baseline smoking status (nonsmokers
vs. current smokers). To investigate the influence of receiving
tobacco direct mail materials on progression of smoking behav-
ior among nonsmokers, we assessed the association between
receiving tobacco direct mail at baseline and the number of
packs of cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up
using linear regression models, adjusting for age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, living with a smoker, and having friends
who smoke. Among baseline current smokers, we assessed the
associations between receiving tobacco direct mail materials
at baseline and reduced number of packs of cigarettes smoked
in the past 30 days at follow-up using logistic regression mod-
els, adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, living
with a smoker, having friends who smoke and whether the
participants smoked >15 days in the past 30 days at baseline.
Clustering by GPU was controlled for through specifying GPU
as a random effect. All analyses were performed in SAS®
v. 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., 2009), and significance level was
set at p < .05.
Results
At baseline for this analysis (2006­2007), among baseline non-
smokers, 5.2% (n = 130) reported receiving tobacco direct mail
materials in the past 6 months (>0%; p < .001; Table 1). Those
under the age of 21 were less likely than those 21 and older
to report receiving tobacco direct mail materials in the past
6 months (p = .008). However, 2.6% of nonsmoking adolescents

who lived with smokers (vs. not living with smokers) and had
friends who smoke (vs. not having friends who smoke) were
more likely to have received tobacco direct mail materials
(p < .05).
At baseline of this analysis (2006­2007), among baseline
current smokers, 23.9% (n = 221) reported receiving direct
mail materials from tobacco companies in the past 6 months
(>0%; p < .001; Table 1). Although those under the age of 21
were less likely than those older than 21 to report receiving
these materials (p < .001), 17.1% of smokers younger than 18
and 21.3% of 18- to 20-year-old smokers reported receiving
direct mail materials from tobacco companies (>0%; p < .05).
Current smokers who had lower education (vs. those enrolled
in a 4-year college) and living with other smokers (vs. not liv-
ing with other smokers) were more likely to have received
these materials (p < .05)
Pertaining to smoking behaviors at follow-up, we found that
baseline nonsmokers who received tobacco direct mail materials
reported smoking more packs of cigarettes in the past 30 days
than those who did not receive these materials (0.34 vs. 0.13
packs; adjusted regression coefficient = 0.21, 95% CI [0.01,
0.41]). Baseline current smokers who received tobacco direct
mail materials at baseline were less likely than those who did not
receive these materials to have reduced their number of packs of
cigarettes smoked in the past 30 days at follow-up (35.5% vs.
43.9%; adjusted odds ratio = 0.69, 95% CI [0.48, 0.99]).
Discussion
Few studies have examined population exposure to tobacco
direct mail marketing. We found that, overall, about 1 out of
20 nonsmoking and 1 out of 4 current smoking adolescents and
young adults in our regional sample reported receiving tobacco
direct mail materials in the previous 6 months. Most concern-
ing is that about 5% of adolescents (regardless of their smoking
status) reported receiving these materials in the past 6 months.
Although it is possible that the materials were sent to the adult
family members in the household, the fact that these adoles-
cents remembered seeing them indicated they were exposed
to this marketing strategy. Tobacco companies claim that they
limit their direct mail marketing to those 21 years old or above
(Philip Morris USA, 2012). However, we found that many of
those under 21 years reported receiving these materials: 4%
of nonsmokers and 21% of current smokers. Although it is
possible that these participants used older adults' identities to
register for tobacco direct mail marketing, our data suggested
that the Master Settlement Agreement and tobacco companies'

self-regulations are not enough to protect adolescents and 18-
to 20-year-olds from tobacco marketing. Overall, the propor-
tion of young adult participants who receive tobacco direct
mail materials in our sample is higher than a previous report
(which was 15.2%) (Lewis, Delnevo, et al., 2004).
Male nonsmokers and less educated smokers were more
likely to report receiving direct mail materials from the tobacco
companies, suggesting that tobacco companies may be target-
ing these subpopulations. The association between education
and receiving tobacco direct mail materials may partly explain
the tobacco use disparity for adolescents and young adults of
lower socioeconomic status (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, 2012).
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective analysis of the
influence of receiving tobacco direct mail materials on subse-
quent smoking behaviors.We found that having received tobacco
direct mail materials at baseline was associated with higher
cigarette consumption at follow-up among baseline adolescent
and young adult nonsmokers and lower likelihood of smoking
reduction at follow-up among baseline adolescent and young
adult smokers. This can be partly explained by the fact that 87%
of tobacco direct mail materials collected between July 2011 and
June 2012 by the Association for Nonsmokers­Minnesota con-
tains coupons for tobacco products (Brock & Moilanen, 2012).
As posited by marketing theory (Rothschild & Gaidis, 1981),
providing coupons can induce purchase among first-time users
and consolidate repeated purchasing behavior among current
users. If this is true, policy interventions to eliminate tobacco
coupons may be effective in reducing the influence of tobacco
direct mail marketing on adolescents and young adults.
One limitation of the study is that attrition may introduce
bias in our estimates. Given those who were lost to follow-
up were more likely to be smokers, which is associated with
receiving tobacco direct mail materials, we may have underes-
timated the prevalence of receiving these materials. However,
because we adjusted for variables associated with dropping out
from the study in the regression models, our estimates from the
regression models should not be severely biased. Our regional
and predominantly non-Hispanic White sample (reflective of
the upper Midwest population) also limits the generalizabil-
ity of our findings to regions of greater racial/ethnic diversity.
Despite these limitations, our findings suggest that the Master
Settlement Agreement and self-regulation by the tobacco
industry have not been effective in protecting adolescents and
young adults from tobacco direct mail marketing. Better sur-
veillance of this marketing strategy is necessary to confirm our
findings and to determine if policy interventions are warranted.
