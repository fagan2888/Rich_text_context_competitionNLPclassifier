Objectives. This study examined the differential impact of social roles and socioeconomic resources on the mental
health of Korean men and women aged 65 years or older.
Methods. The study sample was a weighted population of 930 people (905 survey samples) aged 65 years or older who
had responded to the health behavior survey of the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Results. We observed striking gender differences in the correlates of poor mental health. Living alone was significantly
associated with depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation in men but not in women. Living in a multigenerational family
without a spouse and having a lower household income were significantly associated with poor mental health in both men
and women.
Discussion. We discuss the intriguing evidence of gender differences in the correlates of mental health within the
context of traditional Asian society and suggest further research on social components of gender differences in mental
health across diverse cultures.
RESEARCHERS have attributed differences in the mental
health of men and women to the influence of gender-
related social exposures (Simon, 1995). Such exposures range
from differential socioeconomic experiences of men and
women in terms of labor force participation, financial in-
dependence, and the division of labor and exercise of authority
within households (Mirowsky, 1996; Mirowsky & Ross, 1995;
Turner & Turner, 1999), to health-related behaviors such as
smoking and drinking. These exposures become gender-related
because they are associated with gender roles and socialization.
Mental health problems may result in selection out of social
roles such as being married or employed (Aneshensel, Rutter,
& Lachenbruch, 1991). If the selection is gender related, it may
also contribute to differences in mental health between gender
groups.
Theoretical hypotheses on gendered patterns, arising from
the influence of different social exposures of men and women,
assume that men have traditionally been socialized to give
priority to the breadwinner role, so that any conflict affecting
the employee role may have greater adverse effects on the
mental health of men compared to women (Turner & Turner,
1999). For example, the loss of work roles (stemming from job
loss or retirement) is more threatening to the mental health of
men than of women (Mo
¨ller-Leimku
¨hler, 2003), particularly in
societies in which gender roles are much more strongly
demarcated (e.g., men as primary breadwinners). In contrast,
domestic caregiving needs, such as caring for the young and the
old, affect women's mental health more strongly than men's
(Rosenfield, Vertefuille, & McAlpine, 2000). Women and men
have different expectations of social roles and relationships in
the household over the course of their lives; thus, the health
consequences of family structure vary (Logan & Spitze, 1996).
For example, in midlife, men are the main beneficiaries of their
wives' household work and child care; they suffer more distress
than women after they lose their spouse, particularly due to the
burden of domestic tasks and their lack of social networks and
support through, for example, church attendance or voluntary
group participation (Lee, DeMaris, Bavin, & Sullivan, 2001;
Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Living alone is
particularly detrimental to men, whereas its effects on women
are weaker or inconsistent (Hughes & Waite, 2002; Joutsen-
niemi, Martelin, Martikainen, Pirkola, & Koskinen, 2006).
Likewise, Hughes and Waite found that women in late midlife
exhibited more depressive symptoms when living alone with
children, whereas men living in a similar situation did not.
Differences of gender-related social roles and relations
between countries may result in different gendered patterns
on mental health. Korea, like other East Asian societies, has
maintained a culture characterized to a great extent by
patriarchy and Confucianism, as evidenced by traditional
norms governing the household division of labor, the high
gender income gap (the ratio of female to male income is 0.48),
and the low representation of women in national politics (13%
of parliamentarians are women; United Nations Development
Programme [UNDP], 2005). As a result, Korea ranked 59th
on the 2005 UNDP index of gender empowerment, which
summarizes women's economic autonomy and political par-
ticipation in society. Takeda and colleagues (2004) observed
that patriarchal family structure may influence the mental health
of women. For example, women in multigenerational house-
holds have significantly higher caregiving concerns than
women living with only their husband. Patriarchal culture
may also impose a penalty on men through pressure to
overcommit to work, leading to health-damaging coping
behaviors such as heavy drinking with (male) colleagues after
work. Over the past decades, however, rapid social and

economic changes such as the rising standard of living,
industrialization, expansion of formal education, and increased
female labor force participation have had profound implications
for Korean women (Palley, 1990).
Given the persistence of traditional norms and concurrent
dramatic social changes, older Korean adults who have been
faithful in the performance of their filial duties and sex-
segregated roles are faced with the undesirable impact of rapid
social changes. For example, many older adults, especially
older women living with extended family members, cannot
alleviate their family obligations by deferring the burden to
their married children and daughters-in-law, as their parents did
under traditional norms. Rather, they, instead of their working,
married children and their children's spouses, often continue to
take care of the extended family.
In addition to gender differences, which researchers have
almost universally noted with respect to the prevalence of
psychiatric morbidity, predictors of mental health may also
be gendered. Therefore, this study examined social correlates
and gender differences in the socioeconomic and psychosocial
correlates of mental health among older Koreans. We hypoth-
esized that there would be a differential impact of social factors
on mental health between elderly women and elderly men in
South Korea.
METHODS
Design and Study Population
The data came from the Korean National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) conducted in
2001 by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare.
KNHANES surveys have been repeated with very similar
cross-sectional designs since 1992 at 3- to 4-year intervals with
nationally representative samples of noninstitutionalized per-
sons residing in Korea. The most recent data available at
present are from the 2001 survey.
For the 2001 KNHANES, researchers selected a nationwide
probability sample of the population via a stratified multistage
probability sampling design based on geographic area, gender,
and age group using the 2000 Korean National Census Registry
(Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare, 2002). For the health
behavior survey, investigators selected 4,400 households within
the primary sampling units (13,200), consisting of 10,368
noninstitutionalized individuals aged 12 and older. A total
of 9,170 individuals completed interviews by a trained inter-
viewer, constituting a response rate of 88.45%. The present
study limited its analysis to a weighted population of 930 (905
survey samples) elderly people aged 65 years or older from the
health behavior survey of the 2001 KNHANES. Comparisons
to census data showed that the sample was representative of
the Korean elderly population aged 65 or older in gender and
age. The Research Ethics Review Board of the Seoul National
University School of Public Health approved the protocol for
our analysis.
Mental Health Outcome Measures
We used two self-reported mental health indicators, de-
pressive symptoms and suicidal ideation, as outcome measures
for this analysis. Depressive symptoms were assessed by
a single item: ``How often have you felt depressed or sad during
the past year?'' Responses were on a 4-point interval scale:
always, sometimes, seldom, and never. We divided the
responses into categories for binary logistic regression analysis
by classifying responses of ``always'' in the depression
category and combining all other responses into the no
depression category. Researchers successfully used this method
in a previous study using 1998 KNHANES data (I. H. Kim,
Muntaner, Khang, Paek, & Cho, 2006). Different categoriza-
tions can be used with other statistical methods. For example,
three categories of outcomes (obtained by collapsing ``seldom''
and ``never'' into one category) may be used for multinomial
logistic regression analysis, and all four categories may be used
for ordinal logistic regression analysis. In our study, because
these methods gave similar results, we used the more simple
binary definition of depression for our analysis. Suicidal
ideation was assessed by a single yes/no response item:
``Have you ever thought of taking your life during the past
year?''
Socioeconomic Measures
Education levels were classified as middle school or higher,
elementary school, and uneducated. Current labor market
participation was categorized into yes or no (``no'' included
retired, unemployed, and disabled and out of work). Household
equivalized income (total household income divided by the
square root of the number of household members) was
calculated into tertiles to detect a nonlinear relationship.
Subjective socioeconomic status was assessed by the question
``How would you describe your current socioeconomic status?''
Possible answers were 1 ¼ very rich, 2 ¼ rich, 3 ¼ neither rich
nor poor, 4 ¼ poor, 5 ¼ very poor. To avoid collinearity with
household income, we dichotomized the responses so that
``poor'' and ``very poor'' contrasted with the remaining
categories.
Health Behavior and Living Arrangements
We used two indicators of health behavior. Smoking and
drinking status was classified as never, former, and current,
with never smokers/drinkers as the reference category. Living
arrangements were divided into four categories: (a) living with
spouse only; (b) living with spouse and adult children, elderly
parents, or nonrelated individuals; (c) widowed and living with
children or others; and (d) living alone.
Other Covariates
We also included age and self-reported health status (overall
perceived health, number of physical illnesses) as covariates.
We measured global self-rated health with the question ``How
would you rate your health in general?'' There were five
response options: 1 ¼ very good, 2 ¼ good, 3 ¼ fair, 4 ¼ bad,
and 5 ¼ very bad. We dichotomized the responses to this
question as ``very good'' or ``good'' versus the rest. We eval-
uated the number of physical illnesses using the responses to
questions inquiring about a history of chronic disease such
as cancer, stroke, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and
diabetes mellitus. We classified participants into three catego-
ries according to the total number of aforementioned physical
conditions: 0, 1 or 2, and 3 or more.

Statistical Methods
We calculated the age-standardized prevalence of the
endpoints (depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation) with
age adjustment for 5-year age groups using the direct method.
We used the distribution of all samples as the standard in cal-
culating prevalence. We performed logistic regression analyses
to assess the association between mental health indices and the
covariates. We present results here as odds ratios (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs). We evaluated possible multi-
collinearity between covariates such as age and labor market
participation by correlation analysis and collinearity statistics
tests (tolerance and variance inflation factor tests) as suggested
for logistic regression (Allison, 2003). There was no significant
collinearity between any of the covariates. As we found a
significant interaction between gender and living arrange-
ment in the case of both depression and suicidal ideation
( p , .05), we present all results separately for men and women.
To verify whether there was a significant difference between
gender groups, we performed statistical tests comparing logit
coefficients across groups (Allison, 1999) with the following
two steps. First, we used Wald chi-square statistics to test the
difference in the coefficients between the gender-specific
models. Second, we fitted disturbance variance unconstrained
models to assess whether there was significant residual varia-
tion across gender groups. All statistical analyses were pre-
formed with SPSS (Version 12.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL) or SAS
(Version 9, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Table 1 summarizes the descriptive information for our
sample, as well as the age-adjusted, gender-stratified prevalence
of mental health problems (depressive symptoms and suicidal
ideation). As expected, men reported significantly higher levels
of educational attainment than women, as well as higher levels
of active labor market participation. Men were less likely than
women to belong to the bottom tertile of household income and
were also less likely to be living alone. In addition, as expected,
men were more likely than women to be current smokers and
current drinkers. In contrast, women were more likely than men
to report physical illnesses. The majority of elders in our
sample rated their health as either poor or very poor (74.9% of
men and 83.7% of women).
Women reported significantly higher age-adjusted prevalence
for depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation than men. Among
both men and women, mental health problems were associated
with indicators of socioeconomic position in the expected
directions (i.e., lower educational attainment, lower equivalized
household income, and lower subjective socioeconomic status
were each associated with a higher prevalence of mental health
problems).Livingaloneoraspartof amultigenerationalhousehold
(couples living with their children, elderly parents, or others) was
also associated with significantly elevated risks for mental health
problems compared to living with a spouse alone. Mental health
problems were similarly associated with other predictors in the
expected directions (e.g., a higher prevalence of depressive
symptoms and suicidal ideation was associated with a greater
number of physical illnesses and poor self-rated health; Table 1).
Next we examined gender differences as correlates of mental
health problems. The adjusted ORs for depressive symptoms and
suicidal ideation stratified by gender showed some interesting
differences. Living alone was strongly associated with de-
pressive symptoms in men (OR ¼ 3.58, 95% CI ¼ 1.18­10.76)
but not in women (OR ¼ 1.10, 95% CI ¼ 0.56­2.17). Living in
a multigenerational family without spouse was significantly
associated with depression in women and with suicidal ideation
in both men and women. Gender difference was significant in
living arrangement by Wald chi-square test ( p , .05).
Although the difference in effects by gender was not sta-
tistically significant, being separated from the labor market was
significantly associated with suicidal ideation in men (OR ¼
2.19, 95% CI ¼ 1.12­4.26) but not in women (OR ¼ 1.24, 95%
CI ¼ 0.70­2.19). Among men, current drinkers were twice as
likely to report suicidal ideation in the past year than other
groups, whereas among former drinkers, higher depression
was reported by women; however, the difference in effects
by gender was not statistically significant. In addition, lower
equivalized household income was significantly associated with
poor mental health in both men and women (Table 2). None of
the unconstrained models showed a significant disturbance
variance, suggesting that the differences in the coefficients
between men and women had not arisen from differential
residual variation.
DISCUSSION
Our study revealed evidence of gender differences in
correlates of mental health among older adults in Korea within
their living arrangement. In addition, labor market participation
was a significant correlate among men but not among women.
Lower socioeconomic status was significantly associated with
poor mental health in both men and women.
Researchers have generally assumed that in cultures in which
intergenerational ties are highly valued, coresidence with
children has a positive influence on the mental health of elders.
For example, a study of people older than 65 in Spain, where
children's obligation toward their elderly parents is a social
norm, reported that coresidence was associated with a low pre-
valence of depressive symptoms (Zunzunegui, Be
´land, & Otero,
2001). Similarly, studies in rural Taiwan (Wang, Snyder, & Kaas,
2001) and rural China (Silverstein, Cong, & Li, 2006), where
extended family is culturally dominant, found a positive effect of
coresidence with children on mental health and physical well-
being. In contrast, studies in the United States (Hughes & Waite,
2002; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1994), where independence in
later life is highly valued, found that coresidence with children
can be detrimental to the psychological well-being of elders. Our
study shows that both older men and women living with other
family members (e.g., children or aging parents) reported worse
mental health than did those living with their spouses only. This
finding is consistent with the results from other studies that
suggested a social transition in Korea from multigenerational
coresidence as a standard living arrangement to a more
Westernized family lifestyle with heightened values of privacy
and independence (C. S. Kim & Rhee, 1997). Gender differences
arising from family living arrangements are even more striking if
the estimates are compared between living with children and
living alone. Compared to living with children, living alone
appears detrimental to men, whereas living alone appears
beneficial to women. This suggested difference may be explained
GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CORRELATES OF MENTAL HEALTH S325
by the fact that older women are often expected to provide
support and care for their grandchildren while their daughters or
daughters-in-law work outside the home. Today, working
married women are much more common among younger couples
in Korea (Brinton, Lee, & Parish, 1995). However, social support
of child care for working mothers is lacking, and, as a result, child
care is often transferred to grandparents in the same household
(Chae & Jeong, 2004). In a Korean study of parenting stress of
working mothers (Kang & Cho, 1999), 58.2% of employed
mothers with infants aged 4 to 36 months delegated their caring
responsibility to their mothers or mothers-in-law. Living alone
was also associated with a three- to sixfold increase in the risks
of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation among men but
not among women. When their spouses die, men lose many of
the benefits that wives provide, such as emotional support and
the maintenance of social contact with children and others

(Lee & DeMaris, 2007; Lee et al., 2001). In contrast, a longi-
tudinal health study of women aged 60 to 72 years found that
women living alone were not at risk for increased mental health
or for isolation from social networks and social engagement
(Michael, Berkman, Colditz, & Kawachi, 2001). Unlike our
results, the strong relationship between living alone and psy-
chological distress in men was attenuated after adjusting for
other social variables (i.e., unemployment, lack of social support,
and household income) in a recent representative Finnish study
(Joutsenniemi et al., 2006) and an American study (Hughes &
Waite, 2002). In our sample, the more strongly gendered pattern
of mental health among those living alone reflects the traditional
norms governing the roles of men and women in Korean society.
In our study, the harmful consequences of living with other
widowed people may partly reflect the influence of spousal loss
(Bennett, 1997, 1998; Carr, 2004; Zisook, Paulus, Shuchter, &
Judd, 1997). The gender differences in the effects of being
widowed and living with others may partly account for the
stronger adverse effects of depression on widowers than on
widows (Lee et al., 2001; Stroebe, Stroebe, & Schut, 2001)

GENDER DIFFERENCES IN CORRELATES OF MENTAL HEALTH S327
because the men are more recently bereaved than the women,
given the gender differences in mortality patterns (Lee et al.,
2001; Mastekaasa, 1994).
Regarding gender differences in other correlates of mental
health, we found that labor market participation was a signif-
icant correlate in suicidal ideation among men but not among
women. According to data compiled by the UNDP (2005),
Korean men spend 88% of their time in market activities and
12% in nonmarket activities. In contrast, Korean women
allocate 45% of their time to market activities and 55% to
nonmarket activities. Although this degree of gender imbalance
in time allocation is fairly typical of Asian societies (e.g., Japan,
India), the division of labor between market and nonmarket
activities is shared much more equally among men and women
in developed Western societies (UNDP, 2005). In other words,
compared to women, Korean men may be much more invested
in their work, deriving status, authority, and meaning from their
role as primary breadwinner for their household. Consequently,
separation from work roles through either job loss or retirement
may be more detrimental to the mental health of men than it is
to that of women.
In sum, gender difference in the effects of living arrange-
ments and labor market participation on mental health among
elderly Koreans seems to result from two sources specific to
Korean society: men's strong traditional social roles that are
lost later in life and women's traditional social burdens that are
intensified later in life. In addition, the social transition in Korea
has increased women's labor participation and has added a new
burden to their traditional burden of child care, which now
overflows to the older generation.
Turning to other correlates of mental health, our findings
demonstrate the importance of household income for mental
health among both older men and women. This result is con-
sistent with the results of other studies in Korea (Bae, Kim, &
Yoon, 2005; H. S. Kim, 2003) and in Hong Kong (Zhang,
Ho, & Woo, 2005). In contrast, evidence relating income to
mental health among elderly individuals in Western developed
countries is less consistent. Researchers have observed no
association of income with depression in some U.S. studies
(Kubzansky et al., 2005; Muramatsu, 2003); however, they have
found this association in other studies (Kahn & Fazio, 2005).
The finding of a strong association between household income
and mental health in Korea may be explained, in part, by
inadequate social safety nets for elders. For example, only
12.4% of elderly Koreans receive a public pension, and only
15.6% of these pensioners receive a pension designed to help
protect elderly people with low incomes who are excluded from
the National Pension Scheme (National Pension Service and
Korea Institute for Health and Social Affairs, 2005). Thus, the
family still remains the traditional unit for the care and support
of elders, who tend to live with their children, predominantly
with their sons (J. S. Kim, 2005). Taking care of elders has
become a burden for low-income families, especially since the
1997 economic crisis that has deepened income inequality in
South Korea (C. H. Kim & Jung, 2003).
Readers should consider several limitations when interpret-
ing our results. First, our data were cross-sectional, so we
cannot rule out reverse causation for several of the associations
we found. For example, mental health problems could
precipitate job loss and early retirement, rather than vice versa.
People with mental health problems may also tend not to marry
or may become separated from their spouses, and thus may
more frequently live alone. However, we would have expected
these biases to operate similarly for men and women, whereas
we found a strong association only among men and not among
women. This suggests that some other process is at work
besides social selection alone.
Our measures were also limited in several respects. The
KNHANES survey included information on living arrangement
only. No detailed information was available on such factors as the
household division of labor, caregiving burdens, availability of
social support, and expectations of reciprocity. Further studies are
needed to examine how such variables could explain gender
differences in mental health, as well as the relationships between
work and home conflicts and mental health. Finally, our study was
limited with respect to the single-item measures used to assess
mental health problems. Although the single-item assessments
probably had limited reliability, we nevertheless demonstrated
that each outcome (depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation)
was associated with known predictors in the expected directions.
In summary, this study provides support for the evidence of
differential impact of social resources in mental health between
men and women and suggests that social components of gender
differences in mental health may differ across diverse cultures.
We invite more empirical evidence from diverse cultural settings,
especially from Asian societies, to substantiate this finding.
