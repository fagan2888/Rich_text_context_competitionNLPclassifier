Introduction
As argued by Asadi-Lari, Packham, and Gray (2003b), to
improve health, health systems are required to be designed to
meet people's needs. However, what do we mean by the
word "need" especially with regard to meeting the individu-
al's need or needs in terms of health and health care?
Needs are what is necessary for humans to develop and
function normally (Brewster Smith, 1977; Lederer, 1980). A
need is created by something that is lacking and creates a
state of "disequilibrium" (Doyal & Gough, 1991). Alderfer
(1972) states that needs are required to be met for the "main-
tenance of homeostasis." Needs are something necessary to
achieve a given state of being, for example, being healthy, a
member of a family, a worker, and so on (McLean &
McMillan, 2009). Most authors agree that meeting basic
needs prevents "serious harm" and death (Doyal & Gough,
1991; Kamenetzky, 1992; Lederer, 1980; Mallmann, 1980;
Marshall, 1998; McLean & McMillan, 2009; Reader, 2005;
Soper, 1981; Thomson, 1987; Wiggins, 2005). Others add to
this definition, specifically referring to the avoidance of ill-
ness and improvement of quality of life (Loewy, 1990; C. B.
Macpherson, 1977). Gough (2004) and Alkire (2005) state
that needs and the way they are met are often determined by
experts and not people who they are supposed to benefit.
Needs as defined by experts are referred to as normative
needs. In looking at normative needs, these are defined
through guidelines. As experts may disagree and also evi-
dence may change over time, differences may exist in these
normatively defined needs. It is also debatable if these needs
are applicable to the population as a whole.
Need in health care is caused by some form of "distur-
bance in health and well-being" (Donabedian, 1973). Cohen
(1996) states that health care is a basic need as if the person
does not receive this care he or she will greatly suffer from it.
Also health and therefore health care are necessary for par-
ticipation in society, which makes it an essential need
(Loewy, 1990). In addition, needs in health care are "teleo-
logical" in that they serve a purpose rather than being needed
themselves (Asadi-Lari, Packham, & Gray, 2003a; Baldwin,
1998). For example, the need for insulin itself is linked to it
being necessary for survival. McKee (1996) discusses the
requirement to differentiate between the need for health care
and the need for health. The need for health care is based on
interventions and can be viewed as a medical approach,
whereas health incorporates wider social issues. The Medical
Subject Heading (MeSH) "Needs assessment" is defined as

Needs and Needs Assessments: A Gap in
the Literature for Chronic Diseases
David Beran1
Abstract
It is argued that to improve health, health systems are required to meet people's needs and therefore health systems should
identify these needs and find a way to prioritize these. For those with chronic diseases, these needs are necessary to manage
their condition and go beyond purely the health system. A literature search found that studies published on identifying the
needs of people with chronic diseases fall into the following categories: standardized tools, comparison of needs between
individuals and health professionals, tools for evaluation, and description of needs. This review highlights the gap between
tools used to assess health care needs versus needs for health. It found that a considerable portion of articles focused solely
on health care needs. Many tools focused specifically on psychological or psychosocial needs and only one tool identified
included a broad range of needs for health. The literature fails to address the wider needs of people with chronic conditions
and is still focused on medical interventions. Given the disease burden and the impact of needs outside of the formal health
system, needs assessments should be able to capture the full range and scope of the needs of an individual.

"Systematic identification of a population's needs or the
assessment of individuals to determine the proper level of ser-
vices needed" (National Library of Medicine, 2012). This
term captures the difference discussed by McKee between
health care needs and needs for health. This review will assess
whether for chronic diseases and diabetes needs assessments
focus on the delivery of health care services or address wider
social issues to assess the gap in the literature.
Method
Entering the term "needs assessment" into PubMed, with a
limit on the term only appearing in the title and abstract, no
limits on language and articles published in the past 20 years
yields 2,418 results. Adding the search term of "chronic dis-
ease" yields 18 results. From these, 9 were excluded as it was
felt that they did not fit in with this precise definition of the
MeSH term. For example, 3 of these articles focused on the
needs of professionals for specific training. This process is
detailed in Figure 1.
Further hand searches of articles referenced in these publi-
cations by the author enabled another 75 articles to be identi-
fied. Again, the MeSH definition of needs assessment was
applied focusing only on publications dealing with chronic
conditions or diabetes, but no limit was placed on time of
publication. A specific focus on diabetes was also used to
identify some of these further publications. Diabetes was cho-
sen as it has been argued that it is a good condition to be used
as a tracer for health systems and their management of chronic
diseases (Beran, 2012; Kessner, Carolyn, & Singer, 1973;
Nolte, Bain, & McKee, 2006). Each article was assessed
based on the definition and then classified into different cat-
egories as well as assessed if it addressed health care needs
and/or needs for health.
Results
A total of 63 articles were reviewed to assess whether they
assessed health care needs or needs for health. Fifty-eight
articles focusing on chronic diseases or diabetes were classi-
fied into the following categories:
·
· Standardized tools;
·
· Comparison of needs between individuals and health
professionals;
·
· Tools for evaluation;
·
· Description of needs.
Each of these types of tools plays a role in assessing the
range and scope of needs an individual may have taking dif-
ferent approaches. Five were specifically for diabetes and
proposed frameworks for assessing need in diabetes. Of the
58 articles, 23 of these (40%) did not address needs for health
and focused solely on health care needs (see Tables 1-4). The
following sections detail the main tools as well as including
a summary table highlighting if both health care needs and
needs for health are assessed and which specific needs for
health are included.
Standardized Tools
Specific tools such as the Camberwell Assessment of Need
(CAN) have been developed to measure the health and social
needs of people with mental health problems and have been
used in various settings (Iliffe et al., 2004; Institute of
Psychiatry, 2007). Specifically, for palliative care, the
"Problems and Needs in Palliative Care" questionnaire
assesses the needs of people and is used as a self-reporting
questionnaire (Osse, Vernooij-Dassen, Schade, & Grol,
2007). It employs a checklist to help people identify their
own needs and how and who should respond to these. This
focuses on different areas of need such as daily activities,
physical symptoms, autonomy, social issues, psychological
issues, spiritual issues, financial problems, and other issues
the individual may have. Another tool is the "Supportive
Care Needs Survey" (Bonevski et al., 2000). This tool has as
its aim to assess the needs of people with cancer. It looks at
different types of needs psychological, health system, treat-
ment, information, and impacts on lifestyle of cancer.
Standardized tools were also used to assess the needs of
people with diabetes. These focused on specific subpopula-
tions, for example, adolescent females who live with Type 1
diabetes (Dickinson & O'Reilly, 2004) or Hispanic patients
in inner city New York (Engel, Shamoon, Basch, Zonszein,
& Wylie-Rosett, 1995). Other tools identified were used in
specific contexts such as assessing needs in clinical trials
(Bradley, 1994) or identifying needs for a given patient during

a given consultation (White, 2000). Another structured tool
in diabetes, the Diabetes Patient Assessment Questionnaire
(DPAQ) focuses on improving the care process by collecting
subjective and objective data from the patients as well as
carrying out an assessment of their needs (Campbell &
Bennett, 2002). Table 1 summarizes the different tools
included in this section as well as describing which needs
they address.

Comparison Between Needs Defined by
Individuals and Health Professionals
Different tools and studies were used to compare the needs of
individuals, carers, and health professionals (Hallstrom &
Elander, 2001; Hansson et al., 2001; Walters, Iliffe, Tai, &
Orrell, 2000). Five out of 11 of these studies focus only on
health care needs (Table 2). Many of these studies note that
there are significant differences in the needs identified by
professionals versus those seen as important by patients
(Adab et al., 2004; Bouthillette, 2007; Canonica et al., 2007;
Farrell, 1991; Hallstrom & Elander, 2001; Hansen, Hatling,
Lidal, & Ruud, 2002; Lampic & Sjoden, 2000; Lasalvia,
Ruggeri, Mazzi, & Dall'Agnola, 2000; Lauri, Lepisto, &
Kappeli, 1997).
Tools for Evaluation
Poland, English, Thornton, and Owens (1970) define basic
clinical needs of a hospital-based pediatric population as
"dietary," "vital signs," "cleanliness," "suction," "oxygen
therapy," "toileting" and "turning." Poland et al. (1970)
argue that these needs should be used as a measure of hospi-
tal-based care rather than beds as each bed is occupied by a
patient with very different needs depending on the reason for
his or her admission.

Three studies use the CAN as tool for evaluation, one for
psychiatric reform in Sweden (Arvidsson, 2003), another
with regard to outreach programs in the United Kingdom
(R. MacPherson, Gregory, Slade, & Foy, 2007), and a third
looking at the link between meeting needs and Quality of
Life (QoL) showing that unmet needs may not be a direct
link to poor QoL, but rather act as an influence on this (Slade
et al., 2004). Other approaches looked more at satisfaction
of needs, looking to see if specific symptoms that children
had were responded to appropriately by the health system
(Liberatos, Elinson, Schaffzin, Packer, & Jessop, 2000),
people's expectations and satisfaction with health care
workers (Bendtsen & Bjurulf, 1993), or if the consultation
met people's needs (Benett, 1994; J. Miller, 1982). Needs
assessments for chronic diseases were also used by Chan
and Griffiths (2009) and Rodriguez et al. (2006) to look at
the needs of populations following natural disasters. It is
interesting to note that the majority of these studies do not
evaluate needs for health, but rather health care needs
(Table 3).
Description of Needs
Other studies identified take a descriptive approach to the
needs of people with different chronic diseases and diabetes.
A study of ethnic minority needs in cancer care by Moadel,
Morgan, and Dutcher (2007) looked at unmet needs, unmet
psychosocial needs, and "unwanted needs." "Unwanted
needs" were those that did not fit with what individuals
wanted and may have a negative impact. Needs for people
with cancer have been identified such as emotional, physical,
daily life, support, financial issues, information, and spiri-
tual, but Moadel et al. state that it is unclear if they are appli-
cable to the specific subpopulation they studied. This s of
needs for health that these studies highlight range from eco-
nomic support, food, and psychological as described in Table
4. In looking at health care needs, many studies focus on
information needs, information on medicines, and their side
effects (Beatty, Oxlad, Koczwara, & Wade, 2008; Coker,
2003; Jansen, van Weert, van Dulmen, Heeren, & Bensing,
2007; Tamburini et al., 2003). Gentz (2000), in a review, also
describes those informational needs that include aspects such
as understanding the actual procedure, anatomy and physiol-
ogy, management of risk factors, changes in lifestyle, and use
of medicines.
One of the key problems identified in tailoring the
response to the needs of the individual was that health care
workers are focused on treating the specific disease and do
not address the patient as a whole (Asadi-Lari et al., 2003b;
Brown, 1963). This issue was highlighted in a variety of
studies where the specific needs of the elderly were not taken
into account (Deck, Richter, & Huppe, 2009; King, Martin,
Morrell, Arena, & Boland, 1986). Other research shows that
psychosocial/psychological needs are often not addressed
with a few studies specifically looking at diabetes and
depression (Claiborne & Massaro, 2000; Joska & Flisher,
2007; Martin, Yip, Hearty, Marletta, & Hill, 2002; Piette,
Richardson, & Valenstein, 2004; Rubenzik & Derk, 2009).
Five studies looking at diabetes take different approaches
to identify needs. Hawthorne et al. (2011) looked at children
and their parents' experience and how this should be used to
inform practice. A cross-cultural assessment of need was
conducted by Smide, Ekman, and Wikblad (2002) in Sweden
and Tanzania with regard to different levels of satisfaction
around different aspects of treatment in these two countries.
Two studies looked at needs of people with diabetes in sub-
Saharan Africa, Msoka, Lugina, and Smide (2006) identify-
ing needs by looking at the quality of life of people with
diabetes and those without diabetes in Tanzania and de-Graft
Aikins (2004) in Ghana by taking a critical social-psycho-
logical approach. One of the largest needs assessments with
regard to diabetes was the Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and
Needs (DAWN) Study conceived and initiated by Novo
Nordisk1 (Alberti, 2002). The aim of the DAWN study was
to increase the "understanding of the role psychosocial fac-
tors play with regards to diabetes outcomes" and to find
ways to "improve the psychosocial management related to
diabetes care" (Rubin, Peyrot, & Siminerio, 2006, p. 1257).
It also had as its objectives to increase the understanding of
patient perceptions surrounding diabetes and to identify the
main psychosocial barriers and solutions to improve man-
agement of diabetes (Novo Nordisk, 2001). This study
included 5,426 people with diabetes, 2,194 primary care pro-
vides, 556 specialists, and 1,122 nurses (specialist and gen-
eral) from Australia, Poland, Denmark, France, Germany,
India, Japan, Norway, Spain, Sweden, The Netherlands,
United Kingdom, and United States (Novo Nordisk, 2001;
Peyrot, 2008; Peyrot et al., 2006)
Frameworks for Assessing Need in Diabetes
In addition, for diabetes, specific frameworks with regard to
need were developed. For example, in exploring the experi-
ences of children with Type 1 diabetes, Miller (1999) finds
that children's descriptions could fall into the following
themes and subthemes:
·
· "Finding out"
·
· "Daily discipline"
·
· "Being normal"
·
· "Good things"
·
· "Bad things"
·
· "Support"
Dickinson and O'Reilly (2004), in a study to gain insight
into the lives of adolescent females with Type 1 diabetes,
used Van Manen's phenomenological framework, which
aims to describe and interpret lived experiences. They ana-
lyzed five themes:
·
· "Blending in with the adolescent culture"
·
· "Standing out and being watched"
6 SAGE Open
·
· "Weighing the options and making choices"
·
· "Being tethered to the system and to diabetes"
·
· "Struggling with conflicts"
The Zuluaga­Raysmith model defines 10 basic needs for
elderly people focusing on not only health issues but also
living conditions (Zuluaga, 2000). This model defines 10
basic needs:
·
· Physical health;
·
· Mental, emotional, social, and spiritual health;
·
· Income;
·
· Accommodation;
·
· Protection and security;
·
· Knowledge;
·
· Mobility;
·
· Communication;
·
· Self-development;
·
· Need to make a contribution.
The model states that a deficit in any one of these may
have a negative impact on well-being.
Coles (1996) describes three models of adjustment to dia-
betes in that the physiological needs concern the manage-
ment of symptoms and everyday life, emotional needs relate
to the distress level of the person with diabetes, social needs
are linked to the person with diabetes' relationships and
interactions with others, and finally self-actualization with
the ability to function effectively with diabetes. Using this
model, Coles states that lower needs need to be met first
before moving to higher needs.
In a study looking at what children with Type 1 diabetes
know and want to know about their condition, Olsen Roper
et al. (2009) found that six themes emerged from this study:
"Care," "Physiology," "Consequences," "Impact on the fam-
ily," "Experience at time of diagnosis," and "Cure." The care
theme was divided into three subthemes with Physical,
Emotional, and Ambiguous care. Physical care was the prac-
tical aspects of managing diabetes, such as insulin adminis-
tration, diet, and on. Emotional care was linked to dealing
with the emotional and psychological aspects of diabetes.
The authors created the theme "Ambiguous care" for ele-
ments that could not be placed in the other two care sub-
themes. Physiology knowledge related to how the body
worked, the impact of diabetes, and the science behind the
disease. Consequences related to the short- and long-term
complications of diabetes. Impact on the family related to
how family members assisted children in the management of
diabetes.
Conclusion
This review of the literature was by no means systematic but
had as its aim to highlight the gap between tools used to
assess health care needs versus needs for health. It found that
a considerable portion of articles focused solely on health
care needs. Many tools focused specifically on psychological
or psychosocial needs. Different studies presented a variety
of needs assessed from sexuality and intimacy to food, but
only the CAN addressed a wide range of needs. A medical
view of needs is taken and, in some instances, these studies
were more "satisfaction surveys" or looking at the failings of
guidelines or consultations than true assessments of needs.
These tools developed for chronic diseases or diabetes are
standardized and very specific and do not allow for a wide
view or variation of needs for people at different disease
stages and also in different contexts to be studied. The
DAWN study focuses too much on psychological issues as
well as not presenting its methodology in detail. Msoka et al.
(2006) fail to combine both the wider issues and clinical
aspects, whereas de-Graft Aikins (2004) and Zuluaga (2000)
do the opposite with too much of a medical focus.
Osse, Vernooij-Dassen, de Vree, Schade, and Grol (2000),
in a review of tools used to assess the needs of people with
cancer and their families during palliative care, find that
most tools developed failed to address all aspects palliative
care and that these tools were often for research purposes and
not adapted to the clinical setting. Wen and Gustafson (2004),
in a review, find that the tools developed did not always look
at the needs at the different stages of the person's disease.
The focus of the MeSH term is on the population's needs
or the individuals' to determine the proper level of services
needed. The focus of the literature is still very much on med-
ical interventions and not needs outside of the health system.
For people with chronic conditions, these needs may be more
important than what is provided by the health system. It is
important in addressing the burden of chronic diseases to
look beyond specific health system needs as most of the time
the individual manages his or her condition falls outside of
the realm of the health system (Beran, 2014). In parallel,
nonmedical needs may affect clinical management and there-
fore the health system needs to be aware of these and be able
to include this in the management of the individual to ensure
good overall health.
The development of tools to assess the needs of patients
often do not include the beneficiaries themselves and assess
the needs that health care workers feel are important
(Richardson, Sitzia, Brown, Medina, & Richardson, 2005).
These assessments also fail to clearly define what they mean
by need as all needs cannot be met by the health system, but
in some cases it is important that the health care worker
knows that this need is or is not met. Richardson et al. (2005)
argue that needs assessments should be used
·
· As a communication tool for the interaction between
health care workers and their patients;
·
· As an integral part care;
·
· To identify patient needs;
·
· To identify areas where patients want health care
workers to focus on;
Beran 7
·
· To reassess the given situation of a patient;
·
· With a view that the outcomes should assist with clini-
cal care;
·
· For monitoring and evaluation.
To provide adequate care for chronic conditions, govern-
ments need to assess the health needs of their populations
and this should include the social, financial, or cultural fac-
tors that can be potential barriers (Bobadilla, 1996; Kay,
Bengoa, & Assal, 2006; World Health Organization [WHO],
2007). Needs are infinite, whereas resources for the health
system are finite (Bobadilla, 1996), and therefore with
increasing need and limited resources, there is a widening
gap between what people need and what can be provided.
With the increase in chronic diseases, these needs are also
becoming more complex and also should be adapted to each
individual (Beran, 2012, 2014). Therefore, as argued by
McKee (1996), people managing health systems should
identify the needs of users of the health system and find a
way to prioritize these. Therefore, a wider approach to care is
needed with an assessment of the individual's needs as an
integral part of the care process (Slade et al., 2004).
Interventions would then take into account not only the clini-
cal aspect of the illness but also all unmet needs the individ-
ual faces.
