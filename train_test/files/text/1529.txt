THE National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
(NSHAP) adopts a broad conceptualization of health as
consisting of physical and social well-being. The project is
designed to examine the complex relationships between
these domains. Undoubtedly, quality of life (QoL) and psy-
chological health are both an outcome and a correlate of
these relationships. Within the literature, QoL is defined
and operationalized in a number of ways and can easily
be confounded with health and social well-being (Gill &
Feinstein, 1994; Victor, Scambler, Bond, & Bowling, 2000).
Here, we will focus on the approach NSHAP used to assess
QoL and the benefits and drawbacks of these choices.
Focusing on the relationships between health and social
intimacy, NSHAP is interdisciplinary in its nature. The
project involves a variety of investigators from different
disciplines with different interests. With limited time for
the in-home interview, the operationalization of QoL and
psychological health needed to focus on the specific inter-
ests of the investigators while maintaining a brief, yet broad
approach. Ultimately, they were operationalized through
measures of self-reported emotional health, happiness, self-
esteem, loneliness, depression, anxiety, and stress. Mea-
sures of happiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness
are well established in the literature and, consequently, dis-
cussed only briefly in this manuscript. Alternatively, we
will focus on QoL measures which were modified for their
use in this project, including anxiety, stress, and self-reported
emotional health. We aim to provide evidence for the ade-
quacy of these measures.
Methods
Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
A nationally representative probability sample of commu-
nity-dwelling individuals aged 57­85 years was selected from
households across the United States screened in 2004.African
Americans, Latinos, men, and the oldest-old (75­84 years at
the time of screening) were oversampled. In-home interviews
were conducted in English and Spanish by professional inter-
viewers between July 2005 and March 2006, yielding 3,005
respondents (1,455 men and 1,550 women). The weighted
sample response rate was 75.5% (for extended info, see
O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman & Smith in this special issue).
To decrease respondent burden, minimize in-home inter-
view time, and maximize content, the interview used a
modularized format. During the in-person interview, all re-
spondents were administered indices of self-reported emo-
tional health, happiness, and depression. For all respondents,
the loneliness items were given in a self-administered paper-
and-pencil questionnaire which the respondents completed
after the interviewer had left and mailed back. Indices of
self-esteem, anxiety, and stress were modularized. Respon-
dents were randomly assigned to receive the questions

Background. The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) measures seven indicators of quality of
life (QoL) and psychological health. The measures used for happiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness are well
established in the literature. Conversely, measures of anxiety, stress, and self-reported emotional health were modified for
their use in this unique project. The purpose of this paper is to provide (a) an overview of NSHAP's QoL assessment and
(b) evidence for the adequacy of the modified measures.
Methods. First, we examined the psychometric properties of the modified measures. Second, the established QoL measures
were used to examine the concurrent validity of the modified measures. Finally, gender- and age-group differences were
examined for each modified measure.
Results. The anxiety index exhibited good internal reliability and concurrent validity. Consistent with the literature, a
single-factor structure best fit the data. Stress was satisfactory in terms of concurrent validity but with only fair internal
consistency. Self-reported emotional health exhibited good concurrent validity and moderate external validity.
Conclusions. The modified indices used in NSHAP tended to exhibit good internal reliability and concurrent validity. These
measures can confidently be used in the exploration of QoL and psychological health in later life and its many correlates.

in-person or in the leave-behind instrument. Approximately
33% of respondents received the questions in the self-
administered leave-behind instrument, thus affording an
opportunity to examine the impact of different modalities
on respondent responses to these questions.
The statistical analysis for testing the psychometric prop-
erties of the QoL measures was preformed using Stata 9.0
and SAS. In order to calculate the internal consistency of
the scale measures, we used the Cronbach's alpha coeffi-
cient. Concurrent validity was performed using Pearson
correlations between the modified QoL measures and the
established measures. Additional calculations, such as prin-
cipal components analysis (PCA) for structural validity,
were performed according to relevancy.
Quality of Life and Psychological Health Measures
Seven QoL and psychological health indicators were in-
cluded in NSHAP. First we will briefly introduce the indica-
tors already established in the literature. Second, we will
provide a detailed description of the modified measures.
Depression.--Depressive symptomology was assessed
using the Center for Epidemiological Studies­Depression
(CES-D) scale (Radloff, 1997). In the United States, the
CES-D is an effective and well-used measure of depression for
older adults (Lawton, Brody, & Saperstein, 1989). NSHAP
used the shorter 11-item Iowa form of the CES-D scale,
utilizing the same response categories as in the original
20-item scale. Factor analysis reveals that the Iowa short
form captures the same dimensions as the long-form CES-D
scale while giving up little precision (Kohout, Berkman,
Evans, & Cornoni-Huntley, 1993). Rather than function-
ing as a diagnostic tool to assess a depressive disorder, the
CES-D indicates depressive symptomology in this older
population. This is particularly the case with the shortened
instrument, which has been used successfully in other stud-
ies of aging, including the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) at the University of Michigan. Subjects are asked to
indicate on a 4-point scale how often in the past week they
have felt in accordance with 11 different statements. Responses
are summed for a total score, higher scores indicating more
depressive symptomology. In the NSHAP sample, the stan-
dardized Cronbach's alpha was .80.
Happiness.--Respondents were asked a single item: "If
you were to consider your life in general these days, how
happy or unhappy would you say you are on the whole--
extremely happy, very happy, pretty happy, unhappy some-
times, or unhappy usually?" The question was selected
because of its equivalence to an item from the General
Social Survey, which established concurrent validity (Lee &
Roebuck Bulanda, 2005) and was used in a substantial
number of different researches (Cohen, 2002; Kousha &
Mohseni, 2000; Maselko & Kubzansky, 2006).
Self-esteem.--Time constraints did not allow for an in-depth
assessment of self-esteem. However, Robins, Hendin, and
Trzensniewski (2001) established strong convergent valid-
ity of a single item taken from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale with the other self-esteem constructs. The item, "I
have a high self-esteem," also behaved similarly with a
wide range of criterion measures. Respondents indicate
how true the statement is for them: not very true, somewhat
untrue, neither true nor untrue, somewhat true, or very
true.
Loneliness.--The three items indicating loneliness--"I
lack of companionship," "I feel left out," and "I feel
isolated"--as well as the response categories were adopted
from the HRS 2002 loneliness module. These items were
taken from the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell,
Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Responses to each question are
summed with higher scores indicating greater loneliness.
Internal reliability as found in the HRS module is 0.72
(Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2004). In our sam-
ple, however, the loneliness scale achieved a higher internal
consistency with standardized alpha of 0.81.
The next QoL measures--anxiety, stress, and self-reported
emotional health--were used in a modified way in NSHAP.
Thus, we proceed with introducing their unique way of
measurement followed by evidence of their adequacy.
Anxiety.--A modified version of the seven-item anxiety
subscale of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS-A; Zigmond & Snaith, 1983) was used to assess
feelings of anxiety. Originally designed as a screening
instrument for the assessment of psychological distress in
patients (Zigmond & Snaith, 1983), the HADS has been
used successfully in population-based studies and has estab-
lished reliability and validity (Mykletun, Stordal, & Dahl,
2001). Respondents report on feelings of anxious mood,
thoughts, and restlessness over the past week on a 4-point
Likert scale from 0 to 3, with higher values indicating higher
anxiety levels; scores are summed, and a total score for the
anxiety subscale ranges from 0 to 21. The interviewees are
instructed to give their immediate reaction to each question.
There are two recent exhaustive reviews summarizing the
psychometric properties of the original HADS, populations
studied, testing characteristics, scale homogeneity, test­
retest reliability, and anxiety-case identification properties
(Bjelland, Dahl, Haug, & Neckelmann, 2002; Herrmann,
1997). The psychometric properties of the HADS anxiety
index compare favorably with other well-known scales, such
as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Beck
Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Roemer, 2001). Its internal con-
sistency in a large general population group reproduces that
in patient populations and easily meets the Cronbach's
alpha standard for internal consistency of .60 or greater for
self-administered items (Caci et al., 2003; Mykletun et al.,
2001).

In NSHAP, the same seven items of the anxiety subscale
(HADS-A) were used (see Table 1). In the original HADS
anxiety items, each question had a different set of response
choices. To ease respondent burden and increase consis-
tency throughout the questionnaire, the response categories
were modified to match those of the CES-D. Hence, for
each item, respondents were asked to indicate how often
they felt this way: rarely or none of the time, some of the
time, occasionally, or most of the time. Although these
question response categories have not been tested in a pop-
ulation-based sample, their use greatly improved the effi-
ciency of the questionnaire and decreased interview time.
As in the original anxiety subscale, the seven items were
summed after reverse coding of the single "positive" item:
"I can sit at ease and feel relaxed." Thus, the modified scale
range is 7­28, with higher values indicating higher levels of
anxiety. Due to the change in response options, we pro-
ceeded with a detailed examination of the modified scale to
determine the acceptability of the instrument as well as its
reliability and validity.
Acceptability.--The vast majority of the NSHAP respon-
dents found the anxiety scale acceptable. The response rate
for the seven-item scale was around 93%. This finding is simi-
lar to that found in the research field among patient and non-
patient populations (Herrmann, 1997). As described above,
approximately a third of the respondents received the anxi-
ety items in a leave-behind questionnaire. For the following
description of item response, we omitted from the analyses
respondents who did not return the questionnaire at all (17%
of respondents receiving the items in the leave-behind in-
strument). In all, 96.9% of respondents answered all seven
questions, and 97.9% answered at least 90% of the ques-
tions. Only 1.9% of these respondents answered less than
50% of the items.
Respondents who received the anxiety questions in
the in-person interview responded to more of the anxiety
questions than those respondents who received the anxiety
questions in the leave-behind instrument. In all, 98.7% of
respondents who received the questions in the in-person
interview answered all the questions and 99.5% answered
90% or more. In contrast, 92.6% of respondents receiving
the anxiety questions in the leave-behind instrument
answered all the questions, and 93.8% answered at least
90% of the questions; 5.7% of those respondents using the
leave-behind instrument answered less than 50% of the
questions, compared with only 0.3% of in-person interview
respondents. In addition, respondents using the leave-behind
instrument reported statistically significant higher levels of
anxiety than respondents using the in-person interview.
Reliability.--The standardized Cronbach's alpha coeffi-
cient indicating internal consistency for the HADS-A was
0.76 for the entire sample (The internal reliability across
gender and age groups ranges from 0.73 to 0.78.). This val-
ue, albeit moderate, is in the range found in other studies.
According to Bjelland et al. (2002), the reported HADS-A
alpha in 15 studies varied from 0.68 to 0.93. Caci and col-
leagues argue that "such a result is not surprising in a non-
clinical sample where the variances of the item scores are
classically low" (Caci et al., 2003, p. 93). Thus, we feel the
version of the HADS-A included in NSHAP to be within an
acceptable internal consistency range.
Validity.--Factor structure. Most studies examining the
factor structure of the entire HADS scale achieved a two-
factor solution (Bjelland et al., 2002), a factor for depres-
sion and a factor for anxiety. This two-factor structure
was substantiated among patients (Moorey et al., 1991)
as well as in a healthy large sample (Lisspers, Nygren, &
Soderman, 1997). We used PCA to examine the factor
structure of the HADS-A in NSHAP. In light of the factor
structure found using the entire scale, we expected to
achieve a one-factor solution, as we include only the anxi-
ety subscale.
The PCA verified the one-factor solution. The seven items
loaded heavily on one factor that accounted for 42% of the
variance. This factor was the only factor with an eigenvalue
higher than 1 (eigenvalue = 2.95). In order to test the stabil-
ity of the factor structure achieved, we repeated the analysis
among different age and gender subsamples (see Table 2).
As found in Mykletun et al. (2001), when the two subscales
of the HADS were tested separately, a single-factor solution
was obtained for almost all subsamples. Among males,
however, a two-factor structure was indicated, although all
the seven items loaded heavily on the first factor, which ex-
plained more than 40% of the variance.
Concurrent validity.--Within NSHAP, feelings of anxi-
ety are conceptually incorporated into the larger concept
of QoL and psychological health. As mentioned above,
other indicators of QoL include depression (measured by
the CES-D), stress (Perceived Stress Scale [PSS]-4),
loneliness, self-esteem, emotional health and happiness.

Concurrent validity for the HADS-A can be established by
examining the correlation between these constructs. As
seen in Table 3, the correlations are in the expected direc-
tion, with the strongest association found between depres-
sion and anxiety (.63, p < .001). Positive associations were
found among anxiety, stress, and loneliness. Additionally,
three negative correlations were found among the positive
aspects of QoL: good emotional health, high self-esteem,
and general happiness. As each of these correlations was in
the expected direction, concurrent validity for the HADS-A
was demonstrated.
Anxiety across gender and age.--As seen in Table 4, the
mean HADS-A score was significantly higher among women
compared with men. Additionally, the 65­74 age group was
less anxious compared with the younger age group (57­64).
However, we did not find a significant difference between
the oldest age group and the youngest in this sample. The
mean scores suggest a nonlinear relationship between anxi-
ety and age.
Stress.--In NSHAP, perceived stress was assessed using
the four-item modification of Cohen's PSS (Cohen, Kamarck,
& Mermelstein, 1983). The original PSS scale contains 14
items to assess the degree to which life situations are
appraised as having been stressful during the past month.
Respondents indicate how often they have felt or thought in
the way indicated by the statement on a 5-point Likert-type
scale. Responses range from never (0) to very often (4). The
PSS score is obtained after reversing its seven positive items
and summing all item scores (total score is 0­56), with
higher scores indicating a higher perceived stress level
(Cohen et al., 1983; Cohen, Sherrod, & Clark, 1986).
In the development of the 14-item scale, Cohen et al.
(1983) also validated a shortened version. The four items
(see Table 1) with the highest correlations to the 14-item
scale were selected to comprise the PSS-4. The authors
determined that the PSS-4 was a useful tool for assessing
perceived stress in research where a shortened measure was
required. For NSHAP, two changes were made in the PSS-4.
These changes were primarily to increase consistency across
the depression, anxiety, and stress scales. First, the respon-
dents were asked about feelings during the last week instead
of the last month (as in the original scale). Second, the
response categories were changed to match those of the
CES-D (see above). Due to these changes, we explored
the acceptability, reliability, and validity of this modified
measure.
Acceptability.--The response rate for the modified PSS-4
scale was close to 92%. This finding suggests a good acces-
sibility of the modified version used in NSHAP. As stated
above, approximately one-third of the respondents received
the stress items in the leave-behind instrument. When those
who did not return the leave-behind instrument were omit-
ted, 96.8% of remaining respondents answered all the stress
questions; 98% answered 90% or above. Only 2% answered
50% or fewer of the questions.
Respondents who received the stress questions in the in-
person interview responded to more questions than those
respondents who received the stress questions in the leave-
behind instrument. In all, 98.3% of respondents who re-
ceived the questions in the in-person interview answered all
the questions and 99.5% answered 90% or more. In con-
trast, 93% of respondents receiving the stress questions in
the leave-behind instrument answered all the questions and

94.5% answered at least 90% of the questions; 5.5% of
those respondents using the leave-behind instrument an-
swered less than 50% of the questions, compared with only
0.5% of in-person interview respondents. In addition, re-
spondents using the leave-behind instrument reported sta-
tistically significant higher levels of stress than respondents
using the in-person interview.
Reliability.--The literature supports good internal reliability
for the long version of the PSS (Cohen et al., 1983, 1986;
Cohen & Lemay, 2007; Cohen, Tyrrell, & Smith, 1993;
Hyman, Paliwal, & Sinha, 2007). The PSS-4 demonstrates
lower reliability (0.72) (Cohen et al., 1983). Consistent with
this literature, the reliability for the PSS-4 in our sample
was 0.63. Testing the reliability of the PSS across gender
and age showed the same tendency, with only one exception
concerning the oldest age group (a = 0.55).
Validity.--Concurrent validity. Stress as well as depres-
sion, anxiety, and loneliness reflect the negative aspect of
QoL. Thus, these "negative" facets of QoL were assumed
to be positively correlated. Indeed, The PSS-4 achieved
strong positive correlations with anxiety, depression, and
loneliness (.57, .59, .37, p < .001, respectively). We expect-
ed a negative correlation between perceived stress and the
positive aspects of QoL, measured by happiness, high self-
esteem, and good emotional health. As predicted, the three
positive indicators have significant negative correlations
with the PSS-4 scale (Table 3).
Stress across gender and age.--Similar to the results
found for the anxiety scale, the mean score of the PSS-4
was significantly higher among women compared with men
(see Table 4). The second age group (ages 65­74 years) had
lower scores compared with their younger counterparts. No
differences were found between the oldest and youngest age
groups in the sample. As with anxiety, the mean scores of
the PSS-4 suggest a nonlinear relationship between stress
and age.
Self-reported emotional health.--Self-reported physical
health, a widely used single-item indicator of health, has been
shown to be associated with a wide array of more specific
health measures (Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999; Ostbye
et al., 2006), and some scholars argue that self-reported
health is as useful an indicator of health and mortality as
physician diagnoses (Ferraro & Farmer, 1999; Maddox &
Douglas, 1973; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982). Additionally,
self-reported measures are useful because they define health
as well-being, not just the absence of disease (Ross & Wu,
1996).
With this in mind, we constructed a self-report emotional
health measure to mirror the structure of the self-reported
physical health indicator. NSHAP asked respondents to eval-
uate their emotional health status, using a modified version of
a question asked in the 1992 HRS. The original wording of
the emotional health question asked in HRS was "What about
your emotional health--how good you feel or how stressed,
anxious, or depressed you feel? Is it excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor?" whereas in NSHAP respondents were
asked "What about your emotional or mental health? Is it
excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" This question was
asked of all respondents. The response categories were coded
in NSHAP from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). Thus, higher scores
reflect better perceived emotional health.
Concurrent validity.--As self-reported emotional health
contributes to positive QoL, we anticipated that this mea-
sure would positively correlate with the rest of the positive
QoL indicators. As seen in Table 3, we found a strong posi-
tive correlation between emotional health and perceived
happiness (.43, p < .001). We also found a significant cor-
relation between self-esteem and self-reported emotional
health. We also expected a negative correlation with anxi-
ety, depression, stress, and loneliness. As expected, we
found a strong negative correlation between good self-
reported emotional health and anxiety (-.57, p < .001) and
depression (-.49, p < .001).
External validity.--As shown in Table 5, approximately
65% of respondents reported having very good or better
emotional health. These results differ somewhat from those
reported by the HRS in 1994. We suspect this variation is
the result of both the time lapse between HRS and NSHAP
data collection points as well as differences in question
wording. While NSHAP asked respondents a general ques-
tion about their emotional health status, HRS provided ex-
amples of possible emotional conditions. The inclusion of
emotions that characterize reduced emotional health status
may have encouraged respondents to limit the range of
emotions considered as negative. The NSHAP question,
without the specific clarifiers, should therefore produce a
less biased self-reported measure.

NSHAP INDICATORS OF QUALITY OF LIFE i35
Emotional health across gender and age.--We found sig-
nificant variation between men's and women's self-reported
emotional health. Specifically, women were more likely to
report poorer emotional health; 12% of female respondents
reported "fair" or "poor" health, as compared with only 8%
of males. Similarly, only 22% of women reported "excel-
lent" emotional health versus 30% of male respondents. Re-
sponse distributions were found to be consistent across our
two youngest age categories, with 66% of respondents in
both categories reporting "excellent" or "very good" emo-
tional health. However, fewer adults (57%) in the oldest age
group reported such positive feelings (Table 5).
Discussion
Seven indicators of QoL and psychological health were in-
cluded in the NSHAP. Four of them--anxiety, depression,
stress, and loneliness--reflect the more negative aspect of
QoL, whereas the three others--emotional health, happiness,
andself-esteem--indicateitspositiveside.AlthoughNSHAP's
framework encompasses established measures for happiness,
self-esteem, loneliness, and depression, some modifications
were made for the anxiety, stress, and emotional health mea-
sures. Thus, the central aim of this paper was to present the
changes that were made in NSHAP and to provide empirical
evidence for the adequacy of the modified measures.
The anxiety, stress, and emotional health indicators were
modified for NSHAP to increase efficiency, maintain con-
sistency in response categories across scales, and decrease
respondent burden by decreasing the time it took to admin-
ister the questions. In this article, we established the usabil-
ity of these modified indicators by demonstrating their basic
psychometric properties. The modified HADS-A was found
to be a reliable and valid measure in terms of internal con-
sistency, factor structure, and concurrent validity. Internal
reliability was established across the sample as well as in
gender and age subgroups. The one-factor solution for the
HADS-A found in NSHAP is supported by the literature.
The modified anxiety measure achieved satisfactory con-
current validity as well, with significant correlations to the
other indicators of QoL.
The modified PSS-4 achieved modest internal reliability,
particularly with the oldest age group; caution should be
used when applying the modified scale to the oldest-old. As
with the modified HADS-A, the PSS-4 demonstrated strong
concurrent validity. Finally, the single-item indicator of
self-reported emotional health correlated significantly with
the other measures of QoL in the expected directions.
Gender- and age-group comparisons were conducted for
all three modified measures. Consistent with the literature,
a systematic difference between men and women was found
across all three indices. Women tend to be more anxious
and are more likely to report poorer emotional health
(Christensen et al., 1999; Fuentes & Cox, 2000; Livingston,
Watkin, Milne, Manela, & Katona, 1997; Schoevers, Beekman,
Deeg, Jonker, & van Tilburg, 2003). The findings regarding
age differences, on the other hand, are somewhat more
complex. Findings suggest a nonlinear relationship across
age groups for anxiety and stress. Another explanation is
that the relationship between age, stress, and anxiety is
confounded with gender, as the oldest age group likely in-
cludes proportionally more women who tend to report
higher distress levels. The complex relationships between
age and QoL are certainly an area for further exploration.
Another important topic that could benefit further exami-
nation is the different modes of administration used in
NSHAP. The findings substantiate differences between the
in-person and the leave-behind questionnaires in reported
anxiety and stress levels, with higher levels shown in the
self-completion mode. A similar trend was found in another
study exploring the SF-36 health status scale (Lyons et al.,
1999) and emphasizes the need for further research.
Unfortunately, the inclusion of both the original indices
and their modified forms in the NSHAP questionnaire was
impossible due to time constraints. Consequently, we were
unable to compare the modified indices with their original
forms. As a result, a complete exploration of the validity of
the modified indices is impossible with these data. None-
theless, the modified QoL indicators used in NSHAP
tended to exhibit good quality in terms of internal reliabil-
ity and concurrent validity. We feel confident that these
measures, as well as the more established indicators of
happiness, self-esteem, depression, and loneliness, can be
used in studies of QoL and psychological health among
older adults.
