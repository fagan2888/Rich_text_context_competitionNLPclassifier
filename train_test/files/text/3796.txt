Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a
substantially increased cardiovascular (CV) risk,1,2 and
several international guidelines statements addressing
the management of T2DM3,4 underscore the need to
prevent and reduce CV complications.
Although it is conceivable that glycaemic control plays
an important role in this process, as suggested by epidemio-
logical studies, there remains great controversy concerning
the impact of glucose lowering on CV outcomes from
intensive glycaemic control trials.5 Thus, and in light of the
multiple CV risk factors beyond hyperglycaemia that exist
in most patients with T2DM,6 a multifactorial approach to
addressing CV risk has been emphasized. This includes, in
addition to glucose lowering, the control of blood pressure
(BP) and lipids, weight management, smoking cessation
and, when indicated, anti-platelet therapy.3,4 Despite these
recommendations, it is known to be difficult for most
patients in clinical practice to reach their therapeutic goals.7
Explanations include prevailing patient factors and clini-
cian factors superimposed upon the progressive nature of

Abstract
Given the multi-faceted pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), it is likely that interventions
to mitigate this risk must address cardiovascular (CV) risk factors beyond glucose itself. Sodium glucose cotransporter-2
(SGLT-2) inhibitors are newer antihyperglycaemic agents with apparent multiple effects. Inherent in their mode of action
to decrease glucose reabsorption by the kidneys by increasing urinary glucose excretion, these agents improve glycaemic
control independent of insulin secretion with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. In this review, we outline those CV risk factors
that this class appears to influence and provide the design features and trial characteristics of six ongoing outcome trials
involving more than 41,000 individuals with T2DM. Those risk factors beyond glucose that can potentially be modulated
positively with SGLT-2 inhibitors include blood pressure, weight, visceral adiposity, hyperinsulinaemia, arterial stiffness,
albuminuria, circulating uric acid levels and oxidative stress. On the other hand, small increases in low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol levels have also been observed for the class, which theoretically might offset some of these benefits.
The potential translational impact of these effects is being tested with outcome trials, also reviewed in this article,
powered to assess both macrovascular as well as certain microvascular outcomes in T2DM. These are expected to begin
to report in late 2015.

the disease, as well as the inherent limitations of our current
pharmaceutical armamentarium. In light of the multi-
faceted pathogenesis of CV disease in diabetes, it would be
viewed as an advantage if a specific intervention could
attenuate atherosclerosis risk in a multi-dimensional fash-
ion, and beyond glycaemic control alone.
The potential effect of such interventions on CV risk
might ultimately be dependent on the mode of action of the
drug in terms of which CV pathway(s) were being modu-
lated. However, to date, the potential effects of specific
glucose-lowering agents, that is, sulphonylurea (SU), glin-
ides, metformin, thiazolidinediones, insulin, glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor analogues or dipeptidyl-peptidase-4
(DPP-4) inhibitors, on CV events in patients with T2DM
remain uncertain.8 This was recently illustrated with the
neutral effect for the composite CV death, myocardial
infarction (MI) or stroke from the first two placebo-con-
trolled trials involving the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin
(i.e. SAVOR-TIMI53)9 and alogliptin (i.e. EXAMINE),10
a class associated with beneficial effects on several factors
and biological processes linked to atherogenesis in mecha-
nistic and preclinical studies.11 It should be noted that both
SAVOR-TIMI 53 and EXAMINE were relatively short in
duration (median follow-up 2.2 and 1.5
years, respec-
tively) and included patients predominantly, or exclu-
sively,withovertCVdisease­twoimportantconsiderations
when assessing the potential CV risk modulation of any
compound, although this is also contingent on the mode of
action of the therapy being studied. A sufficient duration of
treatment might be important since macrovascular (as well
as microvascular) disease may be a relatively late compli-
cation of a complex and progressive pathogenic process
that spans years.12 In addition, in T2DM patients with
established CV complications, who are often targeted by
these studies, it may be more difficult to further reduce the
residual CV risk beyond that which standard of care can
offer.13
Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors ­
beyond glucose lowering?
Sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are
a new class of glucose-lowering agents that reduce
hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM by reducing renal
glucose reabsorption; as a result, they increase urinary glu-
cose excretion (UGE).14 SGLTs are found in the proximal
tubule as SGLT-1 and SGLT-2. SGLT-1 is a low-capacity,
high-affinity transporter present in parts of the tubule (seg-
ment 3), but that also is expressed in the small intestine (to
a greater extent than in the kidney) and in the heart. In
contradistinction, SGLT-2, a high-capacity, low-affinity
transporter, is present in segment 1 of the tubule and nor-
mally accounts for ~90% of the glucose reuptake.15
There are currently three drugs of this class that have
been approved by US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA): canagli-
flozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin (Table 1),16­25 with
several others in global or regional development (e.g. ipra-
gliflozin, ertugliflozin, remogliflozin, luseogliflozin,
tofogliflozin and sotagliflozin). In placebo-controlled
phase III trials in patients with T2DM, these agents, as
monotherapy or in combination with other glucose-lower-
ing drugs, improve glycaemic control with a low risk of
hypoglycaemia. They also reduce body weight and BP
without compensatory increases in heart rate and have
some effects on plasma lipids (increase in high-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), increase in low-density
lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), with no change in
HDL-C/LDL-C).26 The class has also been reported to
increase the incidence of urinary and genitourinary tract
infections modestly, in particular in females.26 Common
for all labels of the class are also potential volume deple-
tion-related adverse events.16­21,26
This review provides an overview on the potential for
SGLT-2 inhibitors to reduce CV risk beyond glucose-
lowering effects and presents an overview of the similari-
ties and differences of the currently six ongoing outcome
trials from this class, currently involving more than 41,000
patients.

back into the circulatory system.14 Since the mode of
action of SGLT-2 inhibitors is independent of insulin
secretion, these agents are associated with a low risk of
hypoglycaemia, which has been linked to increased CV
events.27 In addition, they have been demonstrated to ame-
liorate a variety of CV risk factors and potential pathways
as described below (Figure 1).
Improvement in glucose perturbations and in
insulin sensitivity
One potential advantage of SGLT-2 inhibition compared
with other classes of glucose-lowering therapies relates to
the low potential of this class to induce hypoglycaemia,26
unless combined with insulin or an insulin secretagogue.26
This is attributed to several factors beyond the classes'
insulin-independent mechanism of action. These include a
diminished effect of SGLT-2 in the nephron owing to a
physiological decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
during sympathetic nervous system activation from hypo-
glycaemia,28 as well as a putative compensatory increase in
hepatic gluconeogenesis.29 With the potential for the class
to also correct post-prandial glucose levels,22­24 one could
at this point also speculate whether such reductions in glu-
cose variability could have beneficial CV effects. Both
post-prandial hyperglycaemia and glucose variability have
been linked by some investigators to increased CV risk.30
Recent studies have also suggested that enhancing glu-
cosuria with SGLT-2 inhibitors improves insulin sensitiv-
ity as measured by peripheral glucose uptake.29,31 One
investigation found that insulin-mediated tissue glucose
disposal increased by approximately 18% after 2
weeks
with dapagliflozin,31 although such changes are likely sec-
ondary to reductions in glucose toxicity, which improves
beta cell function, as also has been demonstrated with this
drug class. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia have
been associated with increased atherosclerosis risk,32
although proof that improving insulin sensitivity (and/or
reducing plasma insulin concentrations) leads to CV ben-
efit remains elusive. Moreover, the CV relevance from any
indirect changes in insulin sensitivity as a result of SGLT-2
inhibition is entirely unknown.
Reduction in BP and arterial stiffness
In most phase III pivotal trials with SGLT-2 inhibitors, a
reduction in systolic BP in the magnitude of ~3­5mmHg
and diastolic BP of ~2
mmHg has been documented.26
Importantly, this has been observed without a compensa-
tory increase in heart rate.
Figure 1. Identified potential and novel pathways associated with CV effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors based on clinical and
mechanistic studies.
Inzucchi et al. 93
Dedicated 24-h ambulatory BP measurement stud-
ies33,34 have confirmed these data, and interestingly, the BP
reduction seems to be of the same magnitude irrespective
of background therapy, that is, number or type of antihy-
pertensive agents.35
The reason for the observed BP reduction with SGLT-2
inhibitors is not fully understood but likely involves sev-
eral pathways including a modest diuretic effect,34 weight
reduction and potentially some sodium depletion.26
Interestingly, data from an 8-week mechanistic trial dem-
onstrated that empagliflozin reduced arterial stiffness in
patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM);36 thus, a
direct vascular effect might also contribute the BP changes.
SGLT-2 inhibitors may also improve endothelial function
or the vascular architecture, that is, collagen, elastin,
advanced glycation end-products and other components of
connective tissue that participate in the process of arterial
stiffening.37
The findings of no increased heart rate in the setting of
BP reduction are also of note since it may be interpreted as
a relative reduction in the sympathetic nervous system
tone, although modulation of other neurohormonal factors
also could play a role.36
Reduction in body fat and fat mass
With selective SGLT-2 inhibition, glucose reabsorption in
the kidneys is decreased and UGE increased, resulting in
negative energy balance and weight reduction.14 The gluco-
suria induced by the agents is typically associated with a
net calorie loss of approximately 200­300kilocalories per
day38 leading to weight reductions in studies of ~2­3
kg
over 24­52weeks. This is a consistent finding in the pivotal
programmes for the class.26 With SGLT-2 inhibition, as cir-
culating glucose levels are reduced, glucosuria decreases
but remains elevated even in those who achieve near-nor-
mal glucose control.22­25 The reason for a lesser weight loss
than expected from UGE and a plateauing of weight loss
after ~3­6months of therapy is not known, but it has been
suggested that this likely could be related to a compensa-
tory increased energy intake39 since these drugs do not
affect either resting or meal-induced energy expenditure.29
Of potentially greater interest from a CV risk factor
reduction perspective is how they change visceral fat
mass. Visceral adiposity is associated with increased risk
of T2DM, CV complications and overall mortality, pri-
marily related to abnormal adipocyte biology, with
altered production of adipocytokines, leading to modula-
tion of CV pathways that could promote atherosclero-
sis.40,41 In dedicated body composition studies comparing
canagliflozin with glimepiride for 52
weeks,42 dapagli-
flozin with placebo over 104
weeks43 or empagliflozin
with glimepiride44 over 104weeks and assessing changes
in visceral adiposity (VA) mass by dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA), computer tomography imaging
(CTI) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it was
demonstrated that the majority of weight loss associated
with SGLT-2 inhibition was due to reduction in visceral
fat or subcutaneous (SC) fat (Table 2). Interestingly,
even in shorter term studies, assessing changes in indi-
rect markers of visceral adiposity, that is, visceral adi-
posity index,45 waist circumference (WC) or index of
central obesity,46 significant reductions have also been
observed.47 Data on effects on circulating adipokines are
currently sparse. After 24weeks of therapy, dapagliflozin
did not significantly alter either adiponectin or leptin
levels in one study.48 Whether reductions in
visceral adiposity with SGLT-2 inhibition contribute to
CV risk reduction remains to be demonstrated, but it is
an interesting characteristic of this class of agents given
the discordant impact on visceral fat with other classes
of glucose-lowering agents, for example, thiazolidinedi-
ones reduce visceral fat whereas SU does not.49
Effects on proteinuria and kidney function
SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with reductions in uri-
nary albumin excretion as described in dedicated renal
studies with canagliflozin,50 dapagliflozin51 or empagliflo-
zin52 or in pooled analysis of phase III studies.53 To what
extent such a reduction translates into potential CV bene-
fits remains to be clarified; but from a vascular perspec-
tive, this is interesting in light of the haemodynamic renal
changes associated with diabetes. At the onset of diabetes
mellitus, hyperglycaemia causes increases in proximal
tubular reabsorption due to an upregulation of the SGLT-2
expression54,55 leading to secondary increases in sodium/
glucose cotransport. The increase in proximal reabsorption
leads to a decrease in solute load to the macula densa,
alteration of the tubuloglomerular feedback and an increase
in GFR. In a renal mechanistic study in T1DM, it was
observed that renal hyperfiltration was reduced with
SGLT-2 inhibition,56 attributable to increasing afferent
arteriolar resistance without altering efferent arteriolar
resistance,57 thereby leading to a partial correction of
abnormally high baseline glomerular hydrostatic pressure
in the context of hyperfiltration that characterizes early
diabetic nephropathy.58 These data suggest that SGLT-2
inhibition increases distal tubular sodium delivery, which
in turn leads to altered tubuloglomerular feedback and
attenuated intraglomerular hypertension. This is also inter-
esting from the single-nephron theory perspective since it
could in part explain why a slight reduction in GFR is
observed when treatment with SGLT-2 inhibitors is started
(i.e. as a consequence of reducing hyperfiltration in func-
tional nephrons). It has been observed that this GFR reduc-
tion, in patients with stage 2­4 chronic kidney disease, is
reversible when the medication is stopped.52
94 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 12(2)
Reduction in levels of uric acid
Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism in
humans, and hyperuricaemia is a diagnostic marker for
gout. Increased uric acid levels have, however, also been
associated with chronic kidney disease,59 CV complica-
tions60 and congestive heart failure,61 although a cause and
effect relationship of uric acid and CV outcomes is far
from proven.62 Reduction in levels of uric acid has consist-
ently been seen with SGLT-2 inhibitors,63­65 presumably
mediated by the actions of solute carrier family 2, facili-
tated glucose transporter member 9 (SLC2A9), also called
GLUT9, an urate transporter which secretes urate back
into the urine in exchange for glucose.66 It is entirely
unclear whether these uric acid effects might translate into
long-term beneficial outcomes on either renal function or
macrovascular complications.
Effect on lipid parameters
SGLT-2 inhibitors are associated with a small increase in
HDL-C as well as an increase in LDL-C with concomitant
reductions in triglyceride levels63,67­69 (Table 3). Whether
these small lipid changes are clinically relevant and
whether they could potentially offset any potential CV
benefit with SGLT-2 inhibitors will need further
clarification.
Effects on other CV risk pathways
In animal and mechanistic models, SGLT-2 inhibitors have
been shown to reduce leuokocytosis induced by hypergly-
caemia70 and to reduce inflammation and oxidative
stress,71­73 which are processes involved in the pathophysi-
ology of atherosclerosis.
Since inhibition of SGLT-2 leads to glucosuria with an
accompanying diuresis, weight and BP reductions, all of
which are theoretically beneficial in patients with heart fail-
ure, it is also conceivable that impaired ventricular function
and remodelling could be improved with such an interven-
tion. Although clinical data are yet to be reported, an animal
study suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition could attenuate the
increase in left ventricle mass and left ventricle end diastolic
diameter in a rat model of progressive heart failure.74

Clinical CV outcomes with the use of
SGLT-2 inhibitors in T2DM
Pooled analyses of completed phase II/III trials
and interim results from ongoing CV outcome
trials
While anticipating the results of the ongoing outcome tri-
als, several analyses with pooled data from shorter term
trials have been conducted to explore the CV safety pro-
files of the SGLT-2 inhibitors. One of these was a meta-
analysis of 25 canagliflozin and dapagliflozin trials
compared with placebo or an active comparator, involving
a total of 17,181 patients and 283 4-point major adverse
cardiac events (MACE) (CV death, MI, stroke, hospital-
ized unstable angina). The hazard ratio (HR) was 0.89
(95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70, 1.14) for the com-
bined SGLT-2 inhibitor group.26 This result is consistent
with data reported individually from the dapagliflozin trial
programme in conjunction with the FDA approval in
2014.75 That analysis included 21 phase 2b/3 studies that
combined 2.5­10
mg dose, of which two trials enrolled
high CV risk patients, also using a prespecified 4-point
MACE definition. MACE events were adjudicated by an
independent blinded clinical expert committee (CEC) in
19 of the 21 trials. In this analysis, 178 events occurred in
9339 patient analysis. The HR was 0.81 (0.59, 1.09) in
favour of the group randomized to dapagliflozin. A similar
pooled analysis from canagliflozin trials, combining 100
and 300
mg doses, was reported in conjunction with its
2013 FDA approval. 4-point MACE were accrued from
one phase 2 and seven phase 3 trials between 12 and
104weeksinduration(includingfive52-weekandtwo104-
week trials) and one interim analysis of the on-
going Canagliflozin Cardiovascular Assessment Study
(CANVAS) trial.76 In this analysis, 201 4-point MACE
events (all adjudicated by an independent CEC) occurred
in 9632 patients with an overall HR of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.68,
1.22), while the HR for the interim results of CANVAS,
which contributed 80% of the overall number of events
(n=161), was 1.00 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.39).
Another approach to assess potential impact on CV risk
stems from in silico analysis. One study used the
Archimedes Model to predict 20-year outcomes. This pro-
gramme simulates a projected disease trajectory in a
T2DM population with characteristics observed in T2DM
subjects in the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey with HbA1c 7.0%­10.0% and treated with a single
oral glucose-lowering agent. The 20-year simulated out-
come assumed that patients either received standard of
care or dapagliflozin (10
mg) on top of standard of care.
The model showed that patients receiving dapagliflozin
were likely to experience reductions in the incidence of
MI, stroke, CV death and all-cause death by 13.8%, 9.1%,
9.6% and 5.0%, respectively. In addition, there would be

relative reductions in the incidence of end-stage renal dis-
ease, foot amputation and diabetic retinopathy of 18.7%,
13.0% and 9.8%, respectively, when compared with the
current standard of care.77
Collectively, the results of these analyses suggest that
these drugs do not appear to increase CV risk. The limita-
tion of these analyses is that the pooled data of limited
number of CV events was from heterogeneous, short-term
follow-up studies that were neither adequately powered
nor designed to address CV outcomes.
Outcome trials in progress
Given the relationship between CV risk and T2DM, and
the uncertainty surrounding the CV risk of some glucose-
lowering therapies, the US FDA and EMA require evalua-
tion of CV risk for new compounds being developed as
therapies for T2DM.78,79 To comply with this, several large
clinical trials assessing the CV safety of SGLT-2 inhibitors
are ongoing.
There are several common features of these trials
(Table 4). They are all double-blinded and placebo-
controlled, with patients recruited all having T2DM and
being at increased CV risk. In addition, study patients are
all receiving standard of care according to recommended
guidelines. The trials differ in size and, to some degree, in
their target population spanning from higher to lower CV
risk, with some studying only people with established CV
disease (i.e. the highest CV risk population) and others a
mixed population consisting of those with CV risk factors
and/or previous macrovascular complications. Primary
outcomes also vary. Common to the four trials with a
primary CV focus is a primary endpoint definition of a
classical 3-point MACE composite (and not 4-point
MACE). In contrast, two trials remain focused primarily
on renal outcomes.
In each of the trials, CV events are being adjudicated by
an independent Clinical Endpoints Committee (CEC), as
also requested in the FDA safety requirements and EMA
guidance.
The first outcome trial expected to report will be
EMPA-REG OutcomeTM in 2015.80 This trial is investi-
gating the CV profile of empagliflozin versus placebo
superimposed upon prevailing standard of care. There are
several other secondary and tertiary outcomes preplanned
(e.g. hospitalization for heart failure and several renal
endpoints).80 With a minimum of 691 3-point MACE
captured, it will allow for both non-inferiority assessment
of CV safety as well as CV superiority assessment. The
trial commenced in July 2010 and completed recruitment in
April 2012 with 7034 patients (mean age 63.1
years,
HbA1c 8.1%, body mass index (BMI) 30.6
kg/m2,
women/men 28%/72%) with T2DM and established CV
manifestations (100%).
CANVAS,81 for which interim results have already been
disclosed as part of canagliflozins' FDA submission,76 will
continue until 420 3-point MACE events have been
accrued, resulting in relatively limited power due to its
relatively smaller number of events being accrued, for
evaluation of the potential for CV benefits. This trial
commenced in December 2009 and completed recruitment
in March 2011 of 4339 patients (mean age 62.4
years,
HbA1c 8.2%, BMI 32.1
kg/m2, women/men 34%/66%)
with T2DM and established CV disease (62.7%) or CV risk
factors. It is expected to report in 2017.82
The much larger DECLARE-TIMI58, a study that cur-
rently enrols participants with elevated CV risk, plans to
include 17,150 individuals with T2DM and has indicated a
target of 1390 3-point MACE.83 It is expected to report in
201882 and is currently the largest outcome trial ongoing
involving SGLT-2 inhibitors and will be well powered
to answer the question as to whether dapagliflozin could
offer CV benefits, as well as addressing other safety-
related questions.
Of interest, the SGLT-2 inhibitor outcome trial land-
scape also includes two trials primarily designed to assess
impact of canagliflozin on renal outcomes, one being the
CANVAS-R,84 planning to recruit 5700 individuals with
T2DM with change in albuminuria as the primary outcome,
and CREDENCE85 that targets a renal composite outcome
consisting of end-stage kidney disease, doubling of serum
creatinine and CV/renal death in 3627 individuals with
T2DM and established renal impairment/ complications.
Discussion
Given the increasing prevalence of T2DM in populations
worldwide and suboptimal control of glycaemia and
other CV risk factors achieved with currently available
agents, the need for therapies with novel modes of action
remains an important clinical priority. Of the large num-
ber of antihyperglycaemic drug classes now available for
patients with T2DM, none is recognized unequivocally to
reduce CV events over and above any modest effects of
glucose lowering itself. Metformin, which is widely
viewed as having CV benefits, has actually never been
studied in a large properly designed randomized clinical
trial powered to answer this specific question.
SGLT-2 inhibitors are novel oral glucose-lowering
agents that offer the potential to improve glycaemic con-
trol with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, independent of
insulin secretion, offering a modest reduction in BP and
body weight. Their mode of action, which is independent
of endogenous insulin secretion, enables their use in any
stage of T2DM. However, while the potential for CV
benefits from the SGLT-2 inhibitors is alluring, an actual
effect on CV outcomes remains to be proven.
Preliminary attempts have been made to quantify long-
term effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on macrovascular events.
These have included pooled analyses, showing beneficial
trends, from smaller randomized trials being performed
primarily to demonstrate glucose-lowering efficacy and an

in silico analysis of uncertain value. Given the frequent
discordance between the suspected and actual effects of
antihyperglycaemic agents on CV disease, it is important
to await the results of properly powered outcome trials
specifically designed to assess CV safety and/or benefits.86
Greater knowledge concerning the CV effects of our
glucose-lowering therapies is essential for improved evi-
dence-based management of patients with T2DM. As for
the class of SGLT-2 inhibitors, we anticipate first reports
from ongoing CV outcome trials in 2015.
