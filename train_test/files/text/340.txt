OVERWEIGHT and obesity are clearly associated with
the metabolic syndrome, an increasingly prevalent
cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors that predicts diabe-
tes, cardiovascular disease, and mortality (1­3). Yet, recent
research has identified subgroups of metabolically healthy
obese persons and high-risk normal-weight persons, high-
lighting the variability in cardiometabolic health across a
range of body mass index (BMI) groups (4,5). Although
most attention has focused on current weight, research sug-
gests that weight history can independently influence meta-
bolic and cardiovascular outcomes (6­8).
The vast majority of research on weight gain and cardio-
vascular risk controls for weight in early adulthood and ex-
amines the influence of subsequent weight gain (9­11).
Hence, a positive association between weight gain and car-
diovascular risk may occur simply because those who have
gained more weight also have higher current weight (12). In
contrast, we focus on whether weight history contributes to
metabolic risk controlling for current BMI. From a clinical
standpoint, it is important to know whether information on
a patient's weight history has relevance above and beyond
the patient's current weight status.
The age at which weight gain occurs (i.e., the timing of
weight gain) may also modify the risk of metabolic syndrome

Background. The influence of long-term adult weight history on metabolic risk independent of attained body mass
index (BMI) is unknown.
Methods. Using nationally representative data on adults aged 50­64 years from the 1999­2006 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys, we examined weight change for two periods of adulthood: prime age (age 25­10 years
ago) and midlife (the last 10 years). Weight changes in each period were categorized as stable (gain <10 kg) or gain (gain 10
kg) to create weight history comparison groups: stable-stable, gain-stable (prime age gain), stable-gain (midlife gain), and
gain-gain (continuous gain). Persons who lost weight were excluded. Logistic regression predicted odds of metabolic
syndrome and its subcomponents based on weight history, adjusting for current BMI and covariates.
Results. Participants in the gain-stable group had 89% elevated odds of metabolic syndrome (odds ratio = 1.89, 95%
CI: 1.19­3.01) relative to the stable-stable group, even after adjustment for current BMI. All weight gain groups had in-
creased odds of low HDL and high triglycerides relative to participants with continuously stable weights. No significant
associations were found between weight history and hypertension or high glucose.
Conclusions. Weight history confers information about metabolic risk factors above and beyond attained weight sta-
tus. In particular, adult weight gain is related to risk of low HDL and high triglycerides. Weight history may contribute to
our understanding of why some obese older persons are metabolically healthy but others are not.
Key Words: Metabolic syndrome--Weight history--Body mass index--Lipids.
(2). Research has shown that relative risk of hypertension,
high cholesterol, and diabetes associated with a given BMI is
higher at younger ages (13,14). Additionally, earlier adult
weight gain appears to confer a greater risk for coronary heart
disease than later life weight gain (15). The health conse-
quences of weight change may differ by age for a variety of
reasons, including age differences in the interrelationships be-
tween body weight, body composition, and health behaviors.
The aim of this analysis was to determine whether long-
term adult weight history predicts metabolic syndrome in-
dependent of current weight.
Methods
Analyses used participants from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted be-
tween 1999 and 2006. NHANES is an ongoing survey con-
ducted in 2-year cycles (16). Each survey consists of an
interview and a medical examination. Eight years of the most
recently available data are combined here to create an ade-
quate sample size. Eligible participants included persons aged
50­64 years who participated in the fasting subsample. Anal-
yses used STATA 10.0 survey commands to produce weighted
estimates and account for the complex survey design.
ALLEY AND CHANG
112
The NHANES interview component included a weight
history questionnaire with the following questions: "How
much did you weigh 10 years ago?" and "How much did you
weigh at age 25?" Recalled weight has been found to be
highly correlated with measured weight (Pearson correlations
of .73­.87) for men and women with recall periods as long as
37 years (17­20). Participants' current height and weight
were measured as part of the medical examination.
Analysis was restricted to participants aged 50­64 years
for three reasons: (a) Based on typical weight trajectories,
participants' current weights should be near each individ-
ual's highest BMI, providing the opportunity to collect a
complete weight history before significant age-associated
weight loss has occurred (21,22); (b) This age group is of
particular interest because it represents a period when the
prevalence of metabolic syndrome increases (23); and (c)
Because the weight history questionnaire asked about
weight at age 25 and 10 years prior to the interview,
the sample age range must be narrow enough to allow for
reasonably comparable weight change intervals across
participants.
Figure 1 depicts observed periods of weight change. Two
measures of weight change were computed. Prime age
weight change was computed as the difference between
self-reported weight 10 years ago and weight at age 25 years,
and midlife weight change was computed as the difference
between current measured weight and self-reported weight
10 years ago. We modeled weight change, rather than BMI
change, because information about height is incorporated
into analysis by controlling for baseline BMI and a measure
of absolute weight change may better reflect changes in fat
in adulthood (24).
Weight change for each interval was categorized as loss
(any weight loss), stable (a gain of less than 10 kg/22 lb), or
gain (gain of 10 kg/22 lb). Weight gains of 10 kg or more
are clinically meaningful (9), and slight variations in this
cut point did not meaningfully alter our results. Because in-
tentionality of weight loss was unknown and unintentional
weight loss may confound associations between weight
change and health (25), participants who lost weight were
excluded. Thus, our analysis of patterns of weight change
focused on participants with four possible patterns of weight
change across two age periods: stable-stable (stable weight),
gain-stable (prime age gain), stable-gain (midlife gain), and
gain-gain (continuous gain).

In accordance with guidelines of the American Heart As-
sociation and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
(26), metabolic syndrome was defined as having three or more
of the following: (a) triglycerides greater than or equal to 150
mg and the dL or treatment for elevated triglycerides; (b)
HDL cholesterol less than 40 mg/dL in men and less than 50
mg/dL in women or treatment for low HDL; (c) blood pres-
sure greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg or use of antihy-
pertensive medication; (d) fasting glucose greater than or
equal to 100 mg/dL or drug treatment for elevated glucose;
or (e) waist circumference greater than or equal to 102 cm
in men or 88 cm in women. Up to four blood pressure read-
ings were obtained, and all readings after the first were av-
eraged to compute systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest millime-
ter. Serum lipid and glucose measures were analyzed in the
fasting subsample. Triglycerides were measured enzymati-
cally using a series of reactions in which triglycerides
are hydrolyzed to produce glycerol. From 1999 to 2002,
HDL was measured using a heparin­manganese precipita-
tion method. In 2003­2006, HDL was measured directly in
serum using the Roche/Boehringer-Mannheim Diagnostics
(Branchburg, NJ) direct HDL method. Glucose concentration
was determined by a hexokinase method. Participants re-
ported whether they were currently taking medication to
lower their blood pressure or medication for diabetes. Current
use of fibrates and nicotinic acid were considered indicators
of treatment for elevated triglycerides and low HDL (26).
Using logistic regression, we predicted the relative odds
of metabolic syndrome and its subcomponents at age 50­64
years based on current measured BMI and weight history
pattern. The stable-stable category is used as the reference
category in all analysis. Hence, given the same current BMI,
we compare persons who have roughly maintained weight
(within 20 kg) since age 25 years with those who experi-
enced gains during prime age (gain-stable), gains during
midlife (stable-gain), and continuous weight gain (gain-
gain). Controlling for BMI at the time of the exam allows us
to examine whether weight history exerts an effect on meta-
bolic syndrome and its components that is independent of
current weight status. Figure 2 depicts a simplified schematic.
WEIGHT GAIN AND METABOLIC SYNDROME 113
Models compare those with a stable BMI (shown at the
sample mean of 30.4 kg/m2) with those who gained weight
(shown as 10 kg of weight change) during the prime age
period, the midlife period, or both.
If length of exposure to excess weight is the primary de-
terminant of metabolic syndrome risk, those with stable
weights should have the highest risk of metabolic syndrome
and its subcomponents and those who gained weight most
recently, in the midlife period, should have lower risk of
metabolic syndrome. However, if weight gain during the
prime age or midlife period has unique negative metabolic
consequences, participants who gained weight during that
period may have higher relative risk. The effect of weight
gain may also differ by current weight status. For example,
weight stability may be protective among those who are not
obese, but harmful among obese persons. Hence, we also
test for interactions between weight change categories and
obesity status.
All models additionally controlled for current age, sex,
race/ethnicity (African American, Mexican American, and
other compared with non-Hispanic white), education (less
than high school and more than high school compared with
high school graduate), income (using the poverty income
ratio), smoking history (current smoking and former smok-
ing compared with never smoking), and exercise (any vig-
orous activity in the past 30 days vs no activity). Because
waist circumference is strongly associated with BMI and
may have an overwhelming influence on any association be-
tween weight change and metabolic syndrome, additional
models excluded waist circumference from the definition
of metabolic syndrome and predict modified metabolic
syndrome (MMS), defined as having at least three of the
remaining four risk factors (27).
Of the 1751 participants aged 50­64 years who partici-
pated in the fasting exam components, 18 were missing
measured height or weight data, 65 were missing weight
history items, 97 were missing metabolic syndrome data,
and 121 were missing additional covariates. Additionally,
535 participants with weight loss or a history of under-
weight were excluded. Underweight has long-term health
effects thought to reflect unmeasured disease (28), and as-
sociations between weight gain and health are likely to be
significantly different in this group, where weight gain may
indicate recovery from disease (e.g., cancer). This yielded a
final analytic sample of 915 participants.

the sample, and 19%­23% of participants were in each of
the weight gain groups. Age varied across weight history
groups; participants in the stable-gain group were younger
than those with continuously stable weights but those in the
gain-gain group were older. Women were more likely to be
in the gain-gain group. Participants in the stable-gain and
gain-stable groups had lower incomes than those with con-
tinuously stable weights. Participants with a gain-gain pat-
tern were less likely to have been engaged in vigorous
exercise in the past 30 days relative to those with stable
weights. Participants in all three gain-related weight history
groups had higher current mean BMIs and a higher preva-
lence of obesity than those with stable weights. Participants
in the stable-gain and gain-gain groups had higher BMIs at
age 25 years than those with stable weights. The prevalence
of metabolic syndrome was significantly higher in all weight
gain groups relative to those with stable weights.
Table 2 provides odds ratios (ORs) from a logistic regres-
sion predicting the odds of metabolic syndrome and its sub-
components. Model 1 predicts metabolic syndrome based
only on weight history and demographic characteristics,
without controlling for current BMI. In this model, all three
gain weight history patterns were associated with elevated
risk of metabolic syndrome relative to continuously stable
weight. As expected, the highest risk was associated with
gain in both age periods (gain-gain); participants in this group
had more than five times the odds of metabolic syndrome
relative to participants in the stable-stable group (OR =
5.44, 95% CI: 3.40­8.71). After controlling for current BMI
(Model 2), participants in the gain-stable (prime age gain)
group had 89% increased odds of metabolic syndrome
(OR = 1.89, 95% CI: 1.19­3.01), but other weight history
patterns were not significantly associated with metabolic
syndrome after BMI adjustment.
High waist circumference may have an overwhelming in-
fluence on any association between weight change and met-
abolic syndrome. To address this issue, Table 2 also provides
ORs from a logistic regression predicting the odds of MMS
by weight pattern. MMS excludes waist circumference, so
that metabolic syndrome is defined by having three or more
of the remaining four risk factors (27). Using this definition,
participants with gain-stable (OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.42­
4.50) and gain-gain (OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.03­3.79) weight
histories had elevated odds of metabolic syndrome relative
to the stable-stable group.
Further analysis examined the association between weight
history pattern and the components of metabolic syndrome,
excluding waist circumference. Weight history pattern was
not associated with hypertension or high glucose, though
current BMI was significantly and positively associated
with these risk factors. Participants in all three weight gain
groups had elevated odds of low HDL, with more than twice
the odds of low HDL observed for the gain-stable group
(OR = 2.39, 95% CI: 1.45­3.94) and gain-gain groups (OR
= 2.18, 95% CI: 1.15­4.13) relative to continuously weight

stable participants. Participants in all three weight gain
groups also had elevated odds of high triglycerides, ranging
from 95% increased odds for the stable-gain (midlife gain)
group (OR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.25­3.04) to more than 2.5
times elevated odds for the gain-gain group (OR = 2.56,
95% CI: 1.52­4.31).
The advantage of weight stability may be protective among
those who are currently not obese but harmful among obese
persons. Interactions between obesity status and the weight
change categories, however, were not statistically significant
in any of our models. Indeed, the strength of the estimated
influence of weight gain on MMS, low HDL, and higher trig-
lycerides appears large and positive among obese persons.
Discussion
The aim of this analysis was to determine whether long-
term adult weight history predicts metabolic syndrome in-
dependent of attained BMI. Previous analysis has shown
that duration of overweight predicts metabolic syndrome in
U.S. adults (8). This article builds on prior analysis by ex-
amining weight gain itself across a broader span of adult-
hood. Compared with participants in the stable-stable group,
those in the gain-stable group, who experienced weight
gains during the prime age period (age 25 years to a mean
age of 47 years), had elevated odds of metabolic syndrome
at age 50­64 years, even after accounting for current BMI.
This relationship was particularly strong after excluding
waist circumference from the definition of metabolic syn-
drome; participants who gained 10 kg or more during the
prime age period had approximately twice the odds of MMS
at ages 50­64 years, regardless of whether prime age weight
gain was followed by weight stability (gain-stable group,
OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.42­4.50) or additional weight gain
(gain-gain group, OR = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.03­3.79).
These findings suggest that weight gain during adulthood
may have a unique effect on metabolic risk. Further analysis
suggested that this effect may occur through an association
between weight gain, low HDL, and high triglycerides.
These results point to a potential association between weight
gain during adulthood and atherogenic dyslipidemia, a pri-
mary mechanism through which obesity is thought to be as-
sociated with cardiovascular disease (29).
These relationships did not appear to vary by current
weight status. Even among participants who were obese at
midlife, weight gain during adulthood appeared to confer
additional risk relative to weight stability. Recent research
has highlighted the heterogeneity of metabolic risk among
those who are obese (4,5). These results suggest that weight
gain in adulthood may be one risk factor that could help us
understand why some obese persons are metabolically
healthier than others.
There are several potential explanations for the indepen-
dent effect of weight gain on lipid profiles. The pathways
that lead to obesity may differ by age and these varied path-
ways may exert unique effects on risk factors, such that in-
dividuals with the same current weight but different weight
histories have different metabolic profiles. For example,
weight gain in adulthood may be more a product of health
behaviors, but weight gains earlier in life may be more
heavily influenced by genetic disposition (30). The health
effects of obesity may be different for those with early-onset
obesity than for those who became obese related to factors
in adulthood. Previous research has identified a group of
metabolically healthy obese individuals, characterized by
an earlier onset of obesity (before age 20 years) and lower
levels of visceral adipose tissue, as well as lower levels of
triglycerides and higher levels of HDL relative to their met-
abolically unhealthy counterparts with later-onset obesity
(31). Weight gain in adulthood may be more likely to result
in visceral fat accumulation, which accords a higher risk for
high triglycerides than fat accumulation in other areas (32).
Thus, participants who became obese in adulthood may dis-
play particular behavioral or body composition characteris-
tics that alter risk profiles relative to those who became
obese at an earlier age.
In contrast to findings for HDL and triglycerides, none of
the measures of weight history used here was associated
with high glucose, consistent with the hypothesis that at-
tained weight may be the most dominant risk factor for dia-
betes, regardless of weight history (33). The same may be
true of hypertension.
Previous research on the association between weight
change and cardiovascular risk factors has typically exam-
ined the effect of weight change independent of baseline or
early-life weight, rather than current or attained weight (9).
This research has yielded critical public health insights: a
2001 meta-analysis concluded that every kilogram of weight
gain after high school increased the risk of coronary heart
disease by 5.7% for women and 3.1% for men (9). However,
this approach reveals little about whether prior weight infor-
mation is useful in the clinical setting, in which physicians
typically use current weight to assess cardiovascular disease
risk. Associations between weight gain and current health
status that control for baseline weight may simply reflect the
fact that those who have gained the most weight have higher
current weights. This analysis suggests that much of the ef-
fect of previous weight change on metabolic syndrome and
its subcomponents is accounted for by controlling for cur-
rent BMI. However, even after controlling for current BMI,
we found that participants who gained weight in adulthood
had substantially elevated odds of low HDL and high trig-
lycerides (relative to stable weight persons). Future research
should examine these associations using longitudinal data
that allows for more specific comparisons of the effects of
weight gain during different age periods.
There are important limitations to this analysis. First, any
attempt to categorize weight history is likely to be oversim-
plified and may obscure differences within weight history
groups. For instance, by coding all participants who gained
ALLEY AND CHANG
116
less than 10 kg as having stable weights, we include partici-
pants who could have gained as much as 19.8 kg since age
25 years in the stable-stable category. If anything, however,
this is likely to result in an underestimate of the effects of
weight gain, because participants in the reference group
have not had truly stable weights. Previous studies have
suggested that slight weight gain in late adulthood may be
associated with improved health (relative to stable weight,
declining weight, or larger gains), but it is not possible to
distinguish these potential differences in the coding scheme
used here (34). We experimented with modeling weight
history using several different methods. These included the
use of multiple categories for each age period (e.g., stable,
weight loss, gain of 10­19 kg, gain 20 kg); the use of cat-
egories based on quintiles of weight change for each period;
classifying persons based on the percentage of total weight
gain that can be attributed to each period; simply modeling
continuous BMI in each period; and modeling total weight
gain without separating by age period. In each case, results
suggested that larger weight gains were associated with
MMS, low HDL, and high triglyceride levels. We elected to
use the method presented in this article because we find it to
be the most straightforward to interpret. Future research us-
ing more complex measures and categorizations of weight
history is needed.
Another limitation was our use of self-reported weight
history. Although recalled weight has been found to be
highly correlated with measured weight, those who most
seriously misreport weight gain may bias results, particu-
larly if participants with metabolic syndrome were more
likely to underreport previous weights. An additional limi-
tation of this self-reported weight history questionnaire is
that the period of weight change differed based on current
age, resulting in overlap between the prime age and midlife
periods. Alternate models that excluded participants aged
60­64 years to create a more narrow current age range
yielded generally similar results, but had less power due to
reduced sample size. Finally, our analysis was based on
adults aged 50­64 years in 1999­2006. Given the rapid
secular trend of increasing weight across all ages (35), it is
difficult to know whether these results are generalizable to
other cohorts with different weight histories.
Despite these limitations, this research has yielded impor-
tant findings. Weight history confers information about met-
abolic risk factors above and beyond attained BMI. In
particular, adult weight gain is related to risk of low HDL
and high triglycerides. Weight history may contribute to our
understanding of variability in cardiometabolic health within
categories of current weight status (e.g., why some obese
older persons are metabolically healthy but others are not).
