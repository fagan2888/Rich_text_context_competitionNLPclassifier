DataWatch
State Estimates Of Uninsured Children
by Jenifer D.C. Cartland and Beth K. Yudkowsky
Abstract: About twelve million American children lack health insurance. Attempts to assess the
effectiveness of Medicaid expansions and other reforms are hampered by the lack of reliable state-level
data on this population. This DataWatch presents baseline statistics on the insurance status of
children, based on the Current Population Surveys from 1988, 1989, and 1990. The study finds the
sharpest increase in uninsured rates from 1987 to 1989 among middle-class children and among
children ages seven to twenty-one, suggesting that expanding Medicaid will fail to reach a large
portion of the population at greatest risk.
In the United States approximately twelve million children are unin-
sured. Children who do not have health insurance have diminished
access to the health care system, use fewer health services, and are more
likely to have adverse health outcomes.1 Recent Medicaid expansions have
been designed to help states to reduce the large numbers of children without
health insurance. One major obstacle faced by state policymakers in assess-
ing performance of the expansions and other reforms has been the lack of
accurate state-level data on uninsured children.
Previous attempts to estimate the number of uninsured children by state
have met with limited success. Several reports that have used the Current
Population Survey (CPS) to estimate states' uninsured rates are problem-
atic.2 First, because the CPS was designed to provide national estimates,
many such reports yielded imprecise state estimates, especially for smaller
states. Second, reports that combined several years of CPS data to increase
state sample sizes did not measure the precision of those estimates.3
This DataWatch describes a methodology for pooling three years of CPS
data, provides more accurate baseline statistics on the uninsured child
population for each state, and tests the precision of those estimates. State
and national estimates of uninsured children by age and poverty level are
presented. Our findings indicate that (1) the percentage of uninsured
children continues to increase, (2) the percentage of middle-class (family
income greater than 185 percent of the federal poverty level) uninsured

children is growing, and (3) the proportion of children who are uninsured
varies dramatically from state to state.
Methods
Pooling CPS data`. Since 1942 the Bureau of the Census has conducted
the CPS each month to estimate the number of employed and unemployed
individuals. Since 1980 the March survey has included a supplement that
queries subjects about health insurance coverage during the previous calen-
dar year. Because of the CPS's small sample size for many states, pooling
multiple years of data is one strategy for computing state-level demographic
and economic characteristics.4 Hence, to circumvent the small sample
problem in the current study, we employed a similar strategy, pooling three
years of CPS March supplement data into one data set.5
We attempted to identify any national trends that would indicate that
the pooled estimates are overestimates because they do not fully take into
account the effects of the Medicaid expansions implemented during the
period under study. National estimates of the percentage of children who
are uninsured were computed for each age and income group potentially
affected by the expansions: infants, young children, and older children,
with family incomes less than or equal to 100 percent, 185 percent, and
more than 185 percent of the federal poverty level. No trends that might be
attributable to the Medicaid expansions were apparent.
Computing uninsured rates. In this study the uninsured population is
defined in the same way that the Census Bureau defines it for March
supplements conducted after 1987. If a child is covered by any private,
employer-sponsored, or public (Medicaid) insurance, whether that insur-
anee is provided by someone inside or outside of the household, that child
is considered insured. As a result of apparent contradictions in CPS report-
ing for children, other methods of imputing insurance status have been
developed. For example, the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI)
considers a child to have private health insurance coverage if the head of
household has private insurance and the child's coverage comes from
someone residing in the household.6 EBRI also considers a child insured if
he or she receives outside financial assistance and coverage comes from
someone not in the household. In addition, all active military personnel
and their families are excluded from EBRI's analysis. We use the Census
Bureau methods because they err on the conservative side and are consis-
tent with commonly used estimates of insurance status. Family income is
derived from the total family income variable computed by the Census
Bureau, which includes all sources of income.
Limitations. Although pooling multiple years of CPS data provides

more precise estimates of uninsured children by state, even some of the
estimates from the pooled data set were based on rather small sample sizes
(that is, fewer than fifty observations). The precision of particular estimates
can be determined either by examining the sample size or by computing the
standard error, the latter being the more accurate indicator.7
Increase And Variation In Number Of Uninsured Children
In 1989 almost twelve million children in the United States were unin-
sured (Exhibit 1). This represents an increase of 600,000 children since
1987. Nearly two-thirds of the increase is attributable to children between
the ages of seven and twenty-one. The number of uninsured middle-class
children (those children whose family income exceeds 185 percent of the
federal poverty level) increased sharply from 6.6 percent in 1987 to 7.9
percent in 1989--an increase of nearly 700,000 children. Again, children
in the oldest age group experienced the largest increase: from 7.2 percent in
1987 to 8.7 percent in 1989.
The uninsured rates for children vary dramatically by state (Exhibits 2
and 3). States in the northeastern United States have lower percentages of
uninsured children, generally below 10 percent. Rates for states in the
South and West are generally over 15 percent (Exhibit 3). States with the

Conclusion
More uninsured children. Our findings are threefold. First, the number
of uninsured children continues to climb: In only two years, the number of
uninsured children increased by 600,000. Of these children, two-thirds are
between the ages of seven and twenty-one.
Growing middle-class problem. Second, the percentage of middle-class
children who are uninsured is increasing. The number of uninsured middle-
class children increased 20 percent, from 3.1 million in 1987 to 3.8 million
in 1989. All age groups of middle-class children experienced a similar
increase in their uninsured rate. It seems clear that the reduced availability
of health insurance is no longer a problem just for the poor.
This finding has profound policy implications. Although Medicaid has
been expanded substantially, the protection it now provides helps only very
young and very poor children. The income eligibility threshold signifi-
cantly limits the relief that it can provide children of the working poor and
middle class. Moreover, because of the slow phase-in of the eligibility
expansion (the phase-in of children through age eighteen is scheduled to be
completed by 2002), scant protection is available now to older children. By
accelerating the Medicaid expansion phase-in process, immediate relief
could be provided to the poorest of these older children. However, even if
such an acceleration is enacted, children--infants and older children
alike--in working poor and middle-class families would remain vulnerable.
Dramatic state variation. Finally, the extent of the insurance crisis
varies dramatically by state and region, revealing that the nature of the
insurance crisis may vary as well. For example, children in the northern and
eastern parts of the country fare better than children in the western and
southern regions. This may be due to the fact that southern and western
states have large agricultural sectors and that agricultural workers are far less
likely than manufacturing workers to gain insurance through employment.8
In many states the percentage of uninsured middle-class children is three
times higher than it is in other states. These examples indicate that the
depth of the insurance crisis for children appears to be related to fundamen-
tal characteristics of states' economies. If this is the case, federal reforms
that aim to support states' efforts to address the problem of the uninsured
must consider states' unique economic challenges and policy capacities.
With tight federal budgets, some federal lawmakers appear to prefer that
states play the major role in reform. However, federal leadership is still
required. Because of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act's
(ERISA's) preemption of self-insured employers from state mandates, fed-
eral Medicaid income eligibility limits, and other federal stumbling blocks,
states are restricted in their capacity to address the growing problems these

data have uncovered. Without federal reform and support, states are un-
likely to hold the key to universal insurance coverage for children.
Our findings permit each state to obtain comparable baseline informa-
tion from which to measure progress in reducing uninsured rates among
children. They also may be used to target future insurance reforms by states
and the federal government. However, without more aggressive national
leadership, new reforms are likely to result in the continuation of state
disparities in lack of health insurance coverage for children and mounting
impediments to adequate access to health services for this vulnerable group.

5. This decision raised two methodological issues: ( 1 ) year-to-year dependence, resulting
from the fact that 50 percent of the sample from each year is included in the sample for
the following year, and (2) panel-to-panel dependence, resulting from the cluster
sampling design used for the CPS. See Bureau of the Census, Current Population Survey:
Design and Methodology, Technical Paper no. 40 (Washington: U.S. GPO, 1985); and
D.P. Warwick and C.A. Lininger, The Sample Survey: Theory and Practice (New York:
McGraw-Hill, 1975). The sampling error computation for the estimates drawn from
the pooled data set considers both of these sources of dependence.
