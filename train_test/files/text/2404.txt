Trade-Offs Between Public And
Private Coverage For Low-Income
Children Have Implications For
Future Policy Debates
ABSTRACT Much of the discussion around the Affordable Care Act has
focused on likely changes in coverage and access to care for adults.
However, the law also alters coverage options for many low-income
children. We used data from the new Health Reform Monitoring Survey
Child Supplement to examine access to care and related outcomes for
low-income publicly and privately insured children. We found that over
90 percent of low-income insured children had a usual source of care and
had parents who were confident that their children could get the health
care they need, regardless of their type of coverage. However, on a variety
of cost-related measures, including difficulty paying the child's medical
bills, out-of-pocket expenses, and satisfaction with health insurance
premiums and copayments, children with Medicaid or the Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) fared better than those with employer-
sponsored insurance. These results have implications for debates about
the future of CHIP and other policies that affect public and private
coverage options available to children and families.
Largely because of the success of Med-
icaid and the Children's Health In-
surance Program (CHIP), the un-
insurance rate for children under
age eighteen fell from 13.9 percent
in 1997, when CHIP was signed into law, to
6.6 percent in 2012.1 The Affordable Care Act
(ACA) primarily expands coverage for adults,
but it also has important implications for
children.
Children may gain coverage through new sub-
sidies for low- and moderate-income families to
purchase private plans in new health insurance
Marketplaces or as a consequence of the ACA
requirement that people have health insurance
or pay a penalty. Children's participation in pub-
lic coverage programs may also increase as par-
ents' eligibility for Medicaid expands or because
of new outreach efforts and streamlined eligibil-
ity and enrollment systems in Medicaid and
CHIP. As a result of these and other provisions,
theuninsurancerate forchildren mayfallfurther
under the ACA.
The ACA may also lead to shifts in the distribu-
tion of public versus private coverage for
children. Fewer than 500,000 children had
enrolled in Marketplace (exchange) plans as of
April 2014.2 However, subsidized private plans
may cover more children over time because fund-
ing for CHIP is authorized only through Sep-
tember 2015.3
Thereareat least two proposals to extend CHIP
beyond that deadline. In its June report to Con-
gress, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Ac-
cessCommission proposed atwo-yearextension,
to allow time to address concerns about the
affordability and adequacy of exchange cover-
age--with the possibility of a further extension
if the concerns are not addressed.4 In addition,

the CHIP Extension Act of 2014, which seeks a
four-year extension of the program.5
If CHIP is not reauthorized, many people al-
ready enrolled in or currently eligible for the
program may seek coverage in the Marketplaces.
However, children in families with an offer of
"affordable" employer-sponsored insurance will
not be eligible for federal subsidies. This restric-
tion applies even if the insurance requires a large
contribution to cover the child, which may limit
the affordability of Marketplace coverage for
some low-income families.
Several states have also proposed implement-
ing the ACA Medicaid expansion by using Med-
icaid funds to help newly eligible beneficiaries
purchase private Marketplace coverage, with the
possibility of extending this option to children in
future years.6 Such an approach could shift addi-
tional children from public to private coverage.
Thus, as policy makers consider issues related to
CHIP reauthorization, subsidy eligibility rules,
and alternative approaches to expanding Medic-
aid, it will be important for them to better un-
derstand how well public versus private coverage
succeeds at meeting the health care needs of low-
income children.
A great deal of research has found consistent
evidence that health insurance improves access
and service use for children.7 Several studies
have also compared access and use for children
with public versus private insurance using a va-
riety of federal surveys, including the Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey, the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS), and the National Sur-
vey of Children's Health.8­11 After differences
across the two populations are controlled for,
the evidence suggests that children with public
and private insurance are equally likely to have a
usual source of care and to obtain recommended
preventive visits.9­11
Studies have alsofound that children withpub-
lic coverage have more difficulty accessing spe-
cialist care, family-centered care, and after-hours
care.10,11 In contrast, children with private cover-
age experience more cost-related barriers to
care.11
Building on this previous research, we used a
new data source to provide a more recent picture
of access and affordability for low-income chil-
dren with public and private coverage just before
the ACA's 2014 coverage expansions. The Health
Reform Monitoring Survey (HRMS) was initiat-
ed in 2013 in response to the limited availability
of timely data from federal surveys to track
health insurance and access to care under the
ACA.12
We present estimates from the survey's Child
Supplement (HRMS-Kids), which was added in
summer 2013 to provide estimates of health in-
surance and related health outcomes for chil-
dren. This study provides current comparisons
of access and use for children with public and
private coverage and explores access to employ-
er-sponsored insurance among the children who
would be most likely to lose public coverage if
CHIP were not reauthorized. Our results are de-
signed to help inform emerging policy debates
about the structure of health insurance for low-
income children and families under the ACA.
Study Data And Methods
Data Source The HRMS is a quarterly survey
drawn from KnowledgePanel, a probability-
based Internet panel maintained by GfK Custom
Research and based on a representative sample
of US households.13 More information on the
survey's methodology can be found in the online
Appendix.14 The core HRMS targets nonelderly
adults because the ACA coverage expansions pri-
marily affect this population. Because children
may also experience significant effects of the
ACA, HRMS-Kids was added to the core survey
in the summer of 2013. If a respondent to the
core survey reports that there are any children in
the household, a sample child is selected and the
respondent--a child's parent, in the vast majori-
ty of cases--is asked to provide information
about that child's health and health care experi-
ences. This article presents estimates based on
data collected in June­July, September, and De-
cember 2013.15
Sharon Long and colleagues found that the
HRMS produced reliable estimates for adults
when compared to other nationally representa-
tive surveys.16 Similarly, we found that the
HRMS-Kids benchmarks closely to national sur-
veys on key demographic and socioeconomic
characteristics for children. For example, HRMS
estimates of the uninsurance rates for all chil-
dren and for age and racial or ethnic subgroups
are similar to those from the American Commu-
nity Survey (ACS) (Appendix Tables 1 and 2).14 At
the same time, the HRMS finds a higher rate of
employer-sponsored insurance and a lower rate
of Medicaid or CHIP coverage than does the
ACS.17
Rates of health care use on the HRMS-Kids are
comparable to those on the NHIS, with just over
80 percent of children on each survey reporting
a routine checkup in the past twelve months
(Appendix Table 3).14 However, compared to
the NHIS, the HRMS reports that children are
less likely to have a usual source of care and more
likely to report other access problems. A more
detailed discussion of the HRMS-Kids and com-
parisons to the ACS and the NHIS can be found in
the online Appendix.14

The HRMS cannot substitute for established
federal surveys. However, it does provide an op-
portunity to monitor ACA implementation in the
period before estimates from these surveys are
available. For example, HRMS estimates from
March 2014 were released in April 2014, nearly
six months before the expected release of NHIS
estimates from the first three months of 2014.
Moreover, an Internet survey provides consid-
erable flexibility in the instrument, which allows
for the addition of relevant questions in re-
sponse to the changing insurance and policy
landscape. Thus, despite potential anomalies
in the sample compared to established federal
surveys, we believe that the HRMS-Kids can play
an important role in monitoring health insur-
ance and access to care for children under
the ACA.
Analyses To provide insights about the trade-
offs between public and private coverage for low-
income children, we examined several measures
of access, affordability, and satisfaction with cov-
erage for these children in 2013.18 Because peo-
ple can report having multiple types of coverage,
we assigned each child to one type according to
the following hierarchy: employer-sponsored in-
surance; Medicare; Medicaid or CHIP; private
nongroup insurance; nonspecified coverage;
and uninsured.19
An estimated 35 percent of children with fami-
ly incomes of less than 250 percent of the federal
poverty level--which is how we defined low
income20--had employer-sponsored insurance
at the time of the survey, while 50 percent had
Medicaid or CHIP, and 11 percent were un-
insured (Appendix Table 4).14 The remaining
4 percent had Medicare, nongroup insurance,
or unspecified coverage. Our study sample fo-
cused on low-income children under age eigh-
teen who had been insured for the full twelve
months before the survey and who had employ-
er-sponsored insurance, Medicaid, or CHIP at
the time of the survey.
Based on parental reports of children's expe-
riences, we measured the share of children who
had a usual source of careand the shareswho had
had a routine checkup, a dental checkup, and any
emergency department visits in the previous
twelve months. We also examined parents' re-
ceipt of anticipatory guidance (developmentally
based information on healthy lifestyles and the
prevention of accidents and disease) from a
health care provider. The five anticipatory guid-
ance topics we measured were as follows: how to
keep a child from getting injured, how much or
what kind of food the child eats, how much or
what kind of exercise the child gets, how smok-
ing in the house can be bad for the child's health,
and how the child behaves and gets along with
parents and others.
We explored nonfinancial and financial bar-
riers to care, including measures of difficulty
in finding various providers who would see the
child, estimates of out-of-pocket spending, un-
met needs for various types of care that resulted
from affordability concerns, and problems pay-
ing any of the child's medical bills. We also ex-
amined parents' satisfaction with several fea-
tures of their child's coverage. We defined
satisfaction as being very or somewhat satisfied.
Finally, we examined whether parents were con-
fident that their child could get health care if
needed. We defined confidence as being very or
somewhat confident.
We present both unadjusted and regression-
adjusted differences between children with
Medicaid or CHIP and those with employer-
sponsored insurance. Regression-adjusted dif-
ferences controlled for the child's age, sex, race
or ethnicity, general and mental health status,
and functional limitations; and for the respon-
dent's marital status, education, family income
and homeownership status, census region, and
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) status.
The adjusted differences were designed to
make the low-income children with public and
private coverage more comparable to one anoth-
er in terms of their observed health, demograph-
ic, and socioeconomic characteristics so that we
could assess the extent to which the differences
in outcomes were related to insurance status as
opposed to other factors. For example, low-
income children with Medicaid or CHIP were
younger, less likely to be white, and more likely
to live with an unmarried parent, compared to
low-income children with employer-sponsored
insurance (Appendix Table 5).14
People with access to affordable employer-
sponsored insurance are ineligible for federal
subsidies under theACA. Thus,we also examined
access to employer-sponsored insurance for low-
income publicly insured children. We identified
children on the HRMS whose adult respondent
was covered by or had been offered employer-
sponsored insurance. Using information not
typically available on establishedfederal surveys,
we also identified children with access to depen-
dent employer-sponsored insurance through ei-
ther parent.21 We used this information, along
with the current coverage distribution by in-
come, to consider potential changes in coverage
for low-income families under the ACA.
Limitations This study had several limita-
tions. Importantly, our adjusted differences
could not account for unobserved differences
between children with public and private cover-
age that may affect access to care.
In addition, reports on the presence or ab-

sence of insurance coverage are fairly reliable,
but information on type of coverage is subject to
greater measurement error.22,23 Thus, some
respondents might have incorrectly reported
that their child had public versus private cover-
age. Similarly, adult respondents might not al-
ways have accurately recalled the timing of the
child's health care experiences.
Additional measurement issues include sub-
jective perceptions of unmet needs, which might
not align with clinical judgment, and an inability
to precisely identify subsidy eligibility because of
a lack of information on premiums for employer-
sponsored insurance. We were also limited to
national estimates, despite the importance of
state variation in Medicaid and CHIP programs.
Finally, we provide evidence that selected esti-
mates from the HRMS-Kids are consistent with
those from federal surveys. However, we cannot
rule out the possibility of selection bias in our
sample.
Study Results
Access To Care And Service Use Low-income
children with public and private coverage were
equally likely to have a usual source of care
(Exhibit 1). However, publicly insured children
were more likely than children with private cov-
erage to have had a routine checkup in the pre-
vious twelve months (86.3 percent versus
80.1 percent). This difference remained signifi-
cant after we adjusted for demographic, socio-
economic, and health characteristics. Children
with Medicaid or CHIP were also more likely to
have had a dental checkup than those with em-
ployer-sponsored insurance, but this difference
was no longer statistically significant after we
adjusted for potential confounders.
Nearly 40 percent of children with Medicaid or
CHIP had a parent who reported receiving advice
on all five of the recommended anticipatory
guidance topics, compared to 26.0 percent of
children with employer-sponsored insurance
(Exhibit 1). After we adjusted for the character-
istics of the two populations, the magnitude of
the difference was diminished, but it remained
significant.
Nonfinancial And Financial Barriers To
Care An estimated 4.8 percent of children with
Medicaid or CHIP had a parent report trouble
finding a general physician who would see their
child, compared to 4.0 percent of children with
employer-sponsored insurance (Exhibit 2). On
othernonfinancialbarriersto care, childrenwith
Medicaid or CHIP also had slightly higher levels
of difficulty in finding a specialist and a dentist
than children with employer-sponsored insur-
ance. However, none of these differences were
statistically significant.

On cost-related barriers to care for low-income
children, those with public insurance consistent-
ly fared better than those with private insurance.
An estimated 19.0 percent of children with em-
ployer-sponsored insurance had a parent report
difficulty paying their child's medical bills, com-
pared to 9.7 percent of children with Medicaid
or CHIP.
On each of six measures of unmet need, chil-
dren with Medicaid or CHIP were less likely than
those with employer-sponsored insurance to
have problems affording needed care, after dif-
ferences between the two populations were con-
trolled for (Exhibit 2).
Furthermore, 69.4 percent of children with
Medicaid or CHIP had no out-of-pocket spending
for their health care in the previous year, com-
pared to 21.6 percent of children with employer-
sponsored insurance (Exhibit 2). Only 4.7 per-
cent of children with Medicaid or CHIP had
out-of-pocket spending of $500 or more for their
health care in the previous year, while 28.4 per-
cent of children with employer-sponsored insur-
ance had such costs. Adjusting for differences in
the characteristics of the populations reduced
the magnitude of these differences but did not
eliminate their significance.
Satisfaction With Health Insurance Con-
sistent with our findings on cost-related barriers
to access in the previous section, we found that
publicly insured children were much more likely
to have a parent report being satisfied with
the premiums (75.0 percent) and copayments
(73.2 percent) than children with employer-
sponsored insurance (59.3 percent and 60.2 per-
cent for premiums and copayments, respective-
ly) (Exhibit 3). However, whether their child had
public or private insurance, parents reported
high levels of confidence that the child could
get health care if needed.
Access To Insurance Among Low-Income
Children Among children with family incomes
below 138 percent of poverty, 20 percent had
employer-sponsored insurance, 64 percent had
Medicaid or CHIP, and 12 percent were un-
insured (data not shown).24 The remaining 4 per-
cent had Medicare, nongroup insurance, or un-
specified insurance. Most of these children were
eligible for public coverage and would maintain
their eligibility for Medicaid under the ACA
(some children were not eligible because of their
immigration status).

Among children with family incomes of
138­249 percent of poverty, 61 percent had em-
ployer-sponsored insurance, 25 percent had
Medicaid or CHIP, and 8 percent were uninsured
(Exhibit 4). The remaining 6 percent had Medi-
care, nongroup insurance, or unspecified insur-
ance. Children with public insurance could expe-
rience a change in their coverage if CHIP were
not reauthorized. Their income would qualify
them for federal subsidies in the Marketplaces.
However, their eligibility would also depend on a
lack of access to affordable employer-sponsored
insurance.
Among thesepublicly insuredchildren,38per-
cent had access to dependent coverage through a
parent's employer-sponsored insurance, and an-
other 19 percent had a parent with access to
employer-sponsored insurance (Exhibit 4).25 Be-
cause any access to affordable employercoverage
could make the family ineligible for a subsidy,
these estimates suggest that as many as half of
the children with Medicaid or CHIP coverage and
family incomes above 138 percent of poverty
might not qualify for Marketplace subsidies if
CHIP were not reauthorized.26 This could force
families to choose between purchasing a costly
private plan and allowing their child to become
uninsured.
Discussion
Much of the ACA research and policy attention is
currently concentrated on adults. However, chil-
dren may also experience major changes in cov-
erage and access to care under the ACA.
Using estimates from the 2013 HRMS-Kids, we
found that over 90 percent of low-income in-
sured children had a usual source of care and
had parents who were confident that their child
could get the care he or she needed, regardless of
their type of coverage. We also found that low-
income publicly insured children fared better
than those with employer-sponsored insurance
on a variety of cost-related measures, including
parents' difficulty paying the child's medical
bills, level of out-of-pocket expenses, and satis-
faction with health insurance premiums and
copayments. Our analysis also suggests that up
to half of publicly insured children with family
incomes above 138 percent of poverty could
be ineligible for federal subsidies because of
their potential access to affordable employer-
sponsored insurance.26
Our findings have implications for debates
about the future of CHIP and other policies that
affect the public and private coverage options
available to children and families. Allowing CHIP
funding to expire under the assumption that
children eligible for CHIP are in families that
qualify for federal subsidies to purchase Market-

place coverage could leave low-income children
and their families vulnerable on two fronts. First,
many children enrolled in CHIP will not qualify
for Marketplace subsidies if they have a parent
with access to affordable employer-sponsored
insurance.27 Second, children with private cover-
age often face higher premium and cost-sharing
burdens than those with public coverage.3,11
Similarly, efforts to increase reliance on pri-
vate coverage, including state waivers to expand
Medicaid by using federal funds to purchase
Marketplace coverage for eligible people, may
also subject low-income families to significant
out-of-pocket costs. Thus, it will be critical for
policy makers to take into account the health
careneeds and financial resources of low-income
families as they consider options that could alter
the mix of public versus private coverage for low-
income children.
Both public and private coverage may have
other benefits for children that we did not mea-
sure. Medicaid and CHIP often provide coverage
for transportation and a variety of case manage-
ment services, which address the complex needs
of low-income families.28 Along with lower costs,
these benefits may account for the significant
share of children whose families choose Medic-
aid or CHIP when they have access to employer-
sponsored insurance.
At the same time, there are long-standing con-
cerns about access to care for publicly insured
children because of lower payments to providers
and limited provider participation in public pro-
grams.29,30 The fact that over one-third of low-
income children have employer-sponsored in-
surance when some are likely to be eligible for
public insurance suggests that some low-income
families may prefer private coverage for their
children. This may reflect a desire to keep fami-
lies in the same plan or to address provider ac-
cess, stigma, or administrative concerns associ-
ated with public coverage. These families could
benefit from the premium assistance approach
to expanding Medicaid that is being proposed in
several states.6
Conclusion
This analysis has provided important pre-ACA
benchmarks on coverage, access, and affordabil-
ity for low-income children. It will be important
to continue monitoring these and other out-
comes for children as implementation of the
ACA continues.

foundations and the Urban Institute. The
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
the Ford Foundation provide funding for
the core survey and the topical modules.
The Child Supplement was conducted in
partnership with the Center for Children
and Families at Georgetown University
and funded by Atlantic Philanthropies,
the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, and an anonymous donor.
The supplement has benefited from the
input of many of the authors' colleagues.
The authors especially appreciate
contributions by Dana Goin, Michael
Karpman, Joan Alker, and Martha
Heberlein. The HRMS is fielded by GfK
Custom Research. The authors are
particularly grateful for Jordon Peugh's
help in designing the early rounds of the
HRMS and for the ongoing support of
Larry Osborn and Stefan Subias.

SOURCE Authors' analysis of data from the Health Reform Monitoring Survey Child Supplement, sec-
ond quarter of 2013 through first quarter of 2014. NOTES "Access to dependent ESI" means that at
least one parent had an offer of ESI that could cover the child. "Parent has/does not have access to
ESI" refers only to the parent responding to the survey. Percentages may not sum to 100 because of
rounding. CHIP is Children's Health Insurance Program.

17 ACS estimates are subject to more
extensive editing than those of the
HRMS to reflect underreporting of
Medicaid or CHIP coverage and
other issues.
18 Our findings were consistent when
we included data from the first
quarter of 2014.
19 Where applicable, we used state-
specific program names to identify
Medicaid or CHIP coverage and to
assign coverage types based on
write-in responses.
20 We defined low income as less than
250 percent of poverty because the
HRMS includes income breaks only
at 138 percent, 250 percent, and
400 percent of poverty. We also ex-
cluded fifty-four observations with
missing values for key analytic var-
iables.
21 We knew only the respondent's cov-
erage and individual offer status.
However, respondents with children
reported whether either parent had
employer-sponsored insurance that
could cover the child.

under CHIPRA using federal surveys.

summary. Washington (DC): Na-
tional Academies Press; 2010.
p. 14­31.
24 Estimates were based on four quar-
ters of HRMS-Kids data, with 2,606
observations for children whose
family incomes were less than
138 percent of poverty.
25 This estimate is inconsistent with
employer-level data, which suggests
that when employers offer any cov-
erage they generally offer dependent
coverage. See Vistnes J, Zawacki A,
Simon K, Taylor A. Declines in em-
ployer-sponsored insurance between
2000 and 2008: examining the
components of coverage by firm size.
Health Serv Res. 2012;47(3 Pt 1):
919­38. The discrepancy could be
because low-income families are
more likely to work in jobs without
dependent coverage and may report
no offer of coverage if the employer
does not contribute, or it could re-
flect measurement error.
26 These estimates are similar to those
in Medicaid and CHIP Payment and
Access Commission, Report to Con-
gress on Medicaid and CHIP
(Note 4), p. 8, which are based on
data from the Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey.
