Serum Total Cholesterol Concentrations and
Awareness, Treatment, and Control of
Hypercholesterolemia Among US Adults
To the Editor:
The report by Ford et al1 showed, disappointingly, that the
average serum total cholesterol concentration of US adults in the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
declined by only 0.4 mmol/L (2 mg/dL) between 1988 to 1994
and 1999 to 2000. Ford et al1 commented that "the epidemic of
obesity may have slowed the trend" but did not quantify the
degree to which this speculation might be true.
Between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2000, the mean weight of
adults in NHANES increased 4.1 kg, from 75.9 to 80.0 kg (Dr.
Earl Ford, personal communication, May 15, 2003). A pooled
estimate from clinical trials indicates that a 1-kg weight loss
lowers total cholesterol 1.9 mg/dL.2 Assuming weight gain has
an opposite effect, the 4.1-kg increase in the weight of US adults
may have otherwise prevented a 7.8-mg/dL additional decline in
total cholesterol beyond the 2 mg/dL observed. A 7.8-mg/dL
cholesterol decrement potentially could have reduced coronary
heart disease mortality by an additional 11.7% and total mortality
by 8.6%, based on an estimate that a 1-mg/dL decrease in total
cholesterol translates to a 1.5% fall in coronary heart disease
mortality and a 1.1% fall in total mortality.3
Thus, the increase in weight in the US population in the 1990s
indeed very likely had a major blunting effect on the serum
cholesterol trend and possibly on mortality trends as well.

Response
In our article,1 we suggested that the increase in the prevalence
of obesity in the United States that occurred during the 1990s
probably affected the trend in total cholesterol concentration. Dr
Folsom explores the issue in further detail and concludes that the
obesity epidemic may indeed have played an important role.
We examined this issue in a different way by comparing the
change in mean age-adjusted total cholesterol concentrations
with that of age- and body mass index­adjusted concentrations.
We created 3 age groups (20 to 39, 40 to 59, and 60 years) and
3 body mass index groups (25, 25-30, and 30 kg/m2) using
the age or age and body mass index distribution from the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to make these
adjustments. Among all participants, the decrease in the age-
adjusted mean total cholesterol concentration was 0.04 mmol/L
(P0.249) and that in the age- and body mass index­adjusted
mean concentration was 0.06 mmol/L (P0.055). However, the
effect was greatest among white women and was present to a
lesser degree among white men. Adjusting for age and body mass
index had almost no effect on the change in total cholesterol
concentration among African Americans, but this adjustment
resulted in smaller changes than that produced by age adjustment
alone among Mexican Americans.
We should note that the likely effect of obesity is probably
greater than we estimated because sample size considerations led
us to use relatively broad categories of age and body mass index
to adjust. Finer adjustment for body mass index would likely
have accentuated the difference between the change in the mean
age-adjusted and age- and body mass index­adjusted total
cholesterol concentrations.
Two different approaches reach the same conclusion, as
follows: the obesity epidemic likely reduced the change in total
cholesterol concentration that might have occurred in the absence
of this epidemic. Although the disappointingly small change in
mean total cholesterol concentration could affect the future
incidence and mortality of coronary heart disease in the United
States, trends in smoking, hypertension, physical activity, and
other risk factors for coronary heart disease need to be consid-
ered as well.
