Abstract
Objective: To test the hypothesis that double bundle posterior cruciate ligament (PCL)
reconstruction yields better improvement in stability and functional recovery of the knee than the
single bundle technique.
Methods: PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Wanfang and CBM disc databases
were searched for comparative trials of PCL reconstruction using the single- versus double bundle
technique. Data were extracted and meta-analysis was performed for stability improvement and
functional recovery.
Results: The meta-analysis included 435 patients in three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and
eight non-RCTs. Double bundle reconstruction provided significantly better 90 posterior stability
than the single bundle technique (weighted mean difference 0.81, 95% confidence interval, [CI] 0.2,
1.42). Double bundle reconstruction resulted in a significantly higher likelihood of International
Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) examination grade A than the single bundle technique
(odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.24, 0.72).
Conclusions: The small amount of data available indicates that double bundle reconstruction is
superior to the single bundle technique after isolated PCL injury. These findings should be
interpreted with caution due to the low quality and limited sample size of the studies concerned.

Introduction
The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) is
twice as strong as the anterior cruciate
ligament (ACL) and is one of the most
important stabilizers of the knee.1 Around
44% of knee injuries involve damage to the
PCL.2 Both the ACL and PCL comprise two
bundles.1,3 Single bundle PCL reconstruc-
tion cannot always effectively replicate
normal knee joint motion,4 whereas double
bundle reconstruction restores the normal
PCL anatomy and may offer improved
clinical and biomechanical outcomes.4­7 It
has been suggested that double bundle PCL
reconstruction is surgically more complex
than the single bundle technique and may
not be sufficiently clinically superior to
render it worthwhile.7­9
A number of evidence-based systematic
reviews have attempted to determine the
optimal technique for PCL reconstruction,
but their findings are inconclusive.10­14 The
aim of the present evidence-based systematic
review was to perform a meta-analysis to
compare clinical and functional outcomes of
PCL reconstruction using single- and double
bundle techniques. Our hypothesis was that
double bundle PCL reconstruction provides
better restoration of normal knee motion
than the single bundle technique, with con-
sequent improvements in clinical outcome
measurements.
Materials and methods
Search strategy
In accordance with guidelines from the
Cochrane handbook,15 searches of
PubMedÕ, EmbaseÕ, the Cochrane Library,
CNKI, Wanfang and CBM disc databases
were performed for all peer-reviewed studies
published up to April 2014 that compared
double bundle with single bundle PCL recon-
struction. There were no restrictions on pub-
lication language. Search terms were:
``reconstructive surgical procedure''; ``oper-
ation''; ``surgery''; ``posterior cruciate
ligament''; ``single bundle''; ``one bundle'';
``one tunnel''; ``one band''; ``one socket'';
``double bundle''; ``two bundles''; ``two tun-
nels''; ``two bands''; ``two sockets''; ``bi
band''; ``bi socket''; ``bi bundle''; ``bi tunnel''.
Study criteria
Studies were considered eligible for inclusion
if they met the following criteria: (i) com-
parative studies (randomised controlled trials
[RCTs] or non-RCTs); (ii) patients with PCL
tear with or without other knee injuries; (iii)
comparison of arthroscopic single bundle
and double bundle PCL reconstruction; (iv)
outcomes at !12-month follow-up ­ knee 90
posterior stability, knee 30 posterior stabil-
ity, range of knee motion (ROM) and clinical
functional outcomes. The main endpoints for
the meta-analysis were knee posterior stabi-
lity and subjective outcome (Lysholm knee
function score16 or Tegner activity scale17)
and the International Knee Documentation
Committee (IKDC) grade examination.18
Exclusion criteria were: open or repeat
PCL reconstructive surgery; ligament or
other injuries in the contralateral knee;
studies with ``time zero'' (e.g., intrasurgical)
outcome measures; technique articles; com-
parisons within single- or double bundle
techniques; review articles.
Study selection
Article titles and abstracts were independ-
ently screened by two reviewers (X.Y.S. and
Z.Z.). Subsequently, the full text of the
studies that potentially met the inclusion
criteria were read and reviewed to determine
their suitability for inclusion or exclusion in
the present analysis.
Data extraction
Data were extracted independently by two
reviewers (J.X.Z. and Z.M.). Data included
title, authors, year of publication, study
150 Journal of International Medical Research 43(2)
design, sample size, population, age, sex,
type of graft, fixation method, accompany-
ing injuries, surgical procedures, duration of
follow-up and outcome parameters.
Assessment of methodological
quality
Methodological quality of RCTs and non-
RCTs was appraised using the Cochrane
collaboration tool for assessing the risk of
bias15 and Methodological Index for Non-
Randomized Studies (MINORS) form,
respectively.19
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were expressed as weighted
mean difference (WMD) with 95% confi-
dence interval (CI). Dichotomous data were
presented as odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI.
Statistical analyses for continuous and
dichotomous data were performed by inde-
pendent sample Student-t test and Chi-
square test, respectively, using Review
Manager software, version 5.2 (The Nordic
Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane
Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark). P-
values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. Heterogeneity was assessed with
the I2 statistic, where I2 > 50% was con-
sidered substantial heterogeneity. In the case
of substantial heterogeneity, data were
pooled using a random-effects model. A
fixed-effects model was used in the absence
of heterogeneity.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to
explore the influence of preoperative condi-
tions, tools for outcome assessment and
other techniques that varied between
studies.
Results
A total of 157 titles and abstracts were
preliminarily reviewed,9,20­29 of which 11
studies satisfied the eligibility criteria.
These studies included 3 RCTs20­22 and
eight retrospective cohort studies,9,23­29
with a total of 435 patients (n ¼ 229
single bundle; n ¼ 206 double bundle).
The studies were published between 2004
and 2014. Figure 1 shows the process of
literature selection. The characteristics and
demographic data of each study are given
in Table 1. Follow-up duration ranged
from 12­90.5 months.
All RCTs were single-centre studies. Of
these, two21,22 were judged as having mod-
erate risk of selection bias (no details of
random sequence generation;21,22 no details
of blinding method for participants, person-
nel or outcome assessors21). A further study
was judged to have a high risk of perform-
ance bias and detection bias (all procedures
and outcome assessments were performed
by the same author).20 In two studies, over
5% of patients were lost to follow-up.20,22 A
single study reported adequately generated
allocation concealment.22
MINORS quality scores of non-RCTs
are presented in Table 2. The mean score
was 13.5 (range, 12­17), indicating consid-
erable variability in the evidence base. The
comparability of baseline characteristics of
all studies was generally acceptable.
Ten studies (n ¼ 431) reported knee pos-
terior stability at 90 flexion.9,20­28 Double
bundle reconstruction provided significantly
more posterior stability than the single
bundle technique (WMD 0.81; 95% CI
0.20, 1.42 Figure 2), but heterogeneity was
high (I2 74%). There was no significant
between-group difference in posterior stabil-
ity when RCTs alone were analysed
(n ¼ 134).20­22 Sensitivity analyses Table 3
indicated that the double bundle technique
was significantly superior in patients with
PCL isolated injuries (n ¼ 244; P ¼ 0.001 for
all studies; P < 0.001 for RCTs;
Table 3).9,20,22­24,29 There were no signifi-
cant between-group differences in knee sta-
bility at 30 (n ¼ 138)9,21,26,27 or ROM
(Table 4) (n ¼ 88).20,21
Zhao et al. 151
Studies using the Lysholm test found no
significant between-group difference in out-
come (n ¼ 372; Figure 3).9,21­24,26­29 Those
reporting the Tegner activity scale indicated
significantly better outcomes after double-
rather than single bundle reconstruction
(n ¼ 247; OR À0.34, 95% CI À0.68, 0.00;
Figure 4).9,21­23,26 The IKDC examination
was reported in five studies (n ¼ 222)20­23,28
with outcomes categorized as grade A or
grades C/D (Table 4). There were
significantly more patients with grade A
outcomes in the double bundle group than
in the single bundle group (P ¼ 0.002).
Discussion
The optimal technique for PCL reconstruc-
tion remains unclear. The present meta-
analysis comparing single- and double
bundle techniques found that double
bundle reconstruction resulted in superior

dies were subject to reporting bias. The
majority of studies included in the present
analysis had high methodological

meta-analysis. Double bundle reconstruc-
tion was significantly superior to the single
bundle technique, although heterogeneity
was high. Since there was a lack of uniform-
ity regarding injury type as well as assess-
ment tool used, we used sensitivity analyses
to determine the influence of these factors on
the pooled results. Due to the limited data
available, it was not possible to determine
which measurement tool was more accurate
and reliable. Future studies are required to
test and verify the accuracy and sensitivity of
different examination tools, and allow the
standardization of the method used to assess
knee stability.
Biomechanical studies have indicated
that single bundle reconstruction did not
prevent posterior laxity at a flexion angle
<30, and the double bundle technique
resulted in significantly less internal rota-
tional laxity at flexion angles >90.30 The
present analysis included four studies that
assessed posterior laxity at 30 flex-
ion.9,21,26,27 Heterogeneity was high among
these studies (I2 98%), but sensitivity ana-
lyses were unable to identify the source of
bias. Evaluation of knee rotational instabil-
ity was not performed in all studies in the
present analysis, and would be a useful
primary endpoint in future studies in order
to elucidate the reasons for the biomechan-
ical superiority of the double bundle
technique.
Functional clinical outcomes, determined
via the objective IKDC grade and subjective
Tegner activity scale, were significantly
better after double bundle than single
bundle reconstruction, but there was no
significant between-group difference in
Lysholm score. This may be due to the
limited sample size of the present analysis.
The present meta-analysis has several
limitations. First, it included only three
RCTs, and these were of low quality. In
addition, knee posterior stability was
assessed using three different tools, and
rotational instability was not evaluated in
all studies. Finally, complication rates
(including repeat surgery, revision or graft
rupture rate) were not reported. Further
clinical studies are needed to analyse these
points.
In conclusion, the small amount of data
available indicates that double bundle
reconstruction is superior to the single
bundle technique after isolated PCL injury.
These findings should be interpreted with
caution, however, due to the low quality and
limited sample size of the studies concerned.
Further high quality clinical studies are
required to assess the relative merit of
double- and single bundle PCL
reconstruction.
