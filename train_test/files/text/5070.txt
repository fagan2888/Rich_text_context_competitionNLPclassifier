ABSTRACT
GM (grey matter) changes of thalamus and basal ganglia
have been demonstrated to be involved in AD (Alzheimer's
disease). Moreover, the increase of a specific EEG
(electroencephalogram) marker, a3/a2, have been assoc-
iated with AD-converters subjects with MCI (mild
cognitive impairment). To study the association of
prognostic EEG markers with specific GM changes of
thalamus and basal ganglia in subjects with MCI to detect
biomarkers (morpho-physiological) early predictive of AD
and non-AD dementia. Seventy-four adult subjects with
MCI underwent EEG recording and high-resolution 3D MRI
(three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging). The a3/
a2 ratio was computed for each subject. Three groups
were obtained according to increasing tertile values of a3/
a2 ratio. GM density differences between groups were
investigated using a VBM (voxel-based morphometry)
technique. Subjects with higher a3/a2 ratios when
compared with subjects with lower and middle a3/a2 ratios
showed minor atrophy in the ventral stream of basal ganglia
(head of caudate nuclei and accumbens nuclei bilaterally) and
of the pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus; The integrated analysis
of EEG and morpho-structural markers could be useful in the
comprehension of anatomo-physiological underpinning of
the MCI entity.

INTRODUCTION
EEG (electroencephalogram) has been demonstrated as a
reliable diagnostic tool in dementia research (Stam et al.,
2003; Jeong, 2004; Babiloni et al., 2006; Rossini et al., 2008;
Dauwels et al., 2010, 2011) The increase of high a relative to low
a power has been recently demonstrated as a reliable EEG
marker of hippocampal atrophy as well as conversion of patients
with MCI (mild cognitive impairment) in AD (Alzheimer's disease;
Moretti et al., 2011). Moreover, the increase of the h/c ratio has
been found to be associated with the atrophy of amygdala
complex as well as with the conversion of MCI patients in non-
AD dementias (Moretti et al., 2009a, 2009b).
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and PET
(positron-emission tomography)-based studies, approaching
the large-scale neural connectivity issue, showed that
impaired visual working memory correlated with brain
activity within the posterior parietal association cortex,
prefrontal cortex, as well as thalamus nuclei in AD (Collette
et al., 1997; Desgranges et al., 1998; Bokde et al., 2009). A
study using an associate memory task with healthy controls,
MCI subjects and AD patients (Celone et al., 2006) found a
pattern of normal activation in the hippocampus-related
network in healthy controls, a pattern of hyperactivation in
more mildly impaired MCI subjects, a pattern of hypoactiva-
tion in more severe MCI subjects and a pattern of no
activation in AD patients. The non-linear changes in the
memory network activation across the various groups
provided further evidence of previous studies suggesting this
non-linear dynamic in the hippocampus (Dickerson et al.,
2005; Moretti et al., 2007b). Other studies of interest found

that the activation during a task was not altered between the
MCI subjects and the healthy controls (Bokde et al., 2008),
suggesting that connectivity within a network is first altered
due to the putative AD neuropathology, and then changes in
activation occur in the brain. A possible explanation is that
the functional connectivity would be the first step leading to
increased activation in a region that would activate as a
compensatory mechanism.
The large neural network altered in AD encompasses also
deep GM (grey matter) structures (Frisoni et al., 2006, 2007,
2008, 2009; van Strien et al., 2009). In particular, atrophy of
thalamus and basal ganglia has been demonstrated to be
involved in AD (Canu et al., 2010; Cherubini et al., 2010). In
particular, AD is associated with neuronal loss not only in the
hippocampus and amygdala but also in the thalamus and
basal ganglia. Anterodorsal, centromedial and pulvinar nuclei
are the main sites of degeneration in AD (Zarei et al., 2010).
Moreover, volumes of putamen and thalamus were found
significantly reduced in patients diagnosed with probable AD,
and the decrease in volume correlated linearly with impaired
global cognitive performance (de Jong et al., 2008). These
findings strongly suggest that, besides neo-cortical atrophy,
deep GM structures in AD suffer structural changes and that
degenerative processes in the basal ganglia and thalamus may
contribute to cognitive decline in AD.
The relationship between the sources of different EEG
rhythms and thalamus­basal ganglia structure have been
widely studied and accepted. For instance, findings in human
and animal studies suggest that coordinated simultaneous h
activity is observed in two networks linked, respectively, to
striatal nucleus (Llina
´s et al., 1999) and to the frontal­
anterior thalamic system (Kirk and Mackay, 2003; Schmiedt et
al., 2005). The a rhythm generation is quite more complex.
The a dominant rhythm arises from the continuous interplay
among posterior thalamo­caudate loop, posterior cingulated
and parieto­occipital cortical areas (Steriade, 2006; Cantero
et al., 2009). As a consequence, the generation of a rhythm is
linked to the cortico­thalamo­caudate loops Of note,
changes in a and c oscillatory activity, impinging on
thalamo­cortical posterior networks, have been shown to
play a relevant functional role during perceptual, executive
and mnemonic processes (Klimesch, 1997). Moreover, episodic
memory process studies have demonstrated the modulation
of the EEG rhythms by deep brain structure, such as basal
ganglia and thalamus (Hart et al., 2012). Depending on the
context, caudate modulation of interactions between cortical
and the thalamus or cortical and more posterior cortical
regions could suppress incorrect objects and enhance
representations of the correct object, followed by termination
of the retrieval process revealed by increase in upper a or b
band (Crosson et al., 2003). Thalamic function is essential to
effective semantic-memory retrieval and is disrupted to
varying degrees in cognitive impaired patients. In particular,
it has been demonstrated that in the most impaired patients,
who made more errors and had longer reaction times, there
was an increase in thalamic BOLD signal as reaction times
increased. These findings demonstrate that thalamic dys-
function correlates with object memory retrieval errors.
An important component of the circuit is the pulvinar
synchronization of primary and non-primary visual cortices via
a/c EEG rhythms propagated through corticothalamic pathways
(Bekisz and Wrobel, 1999; Sherman and Guillery, 2002; Shipp,
2003; Wrobel et al., 2007). An important question is what
semantic operations engage this mechanism or specific aspects
of it. A recent work (Hart et al., 2012) has proposed that the
cortical­thalamus­caudate circuit is engaged for complex,
controlled semantic search and retrieval. This notion extends
from the proposition that the thalamus and basal ganglia
(caudate) are engaged by higher-order language processing that
cannot rely on automatic processing, but which recruits
controlled processes and might reflect a strategic semantic
search mechanism (Ketteler et al., 2008). These processes are
reflected by modulation of upper a frequency.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that the increase of
high a relative to low a power is a reliable EEG marker
of hippocampal atrophy (Moretti et al., 2007b) and amigdalo-
hippocampal complex atrophy (Moretti et al., 2009b).
Furthermore, the increase in a3/a2 power ratio has been
demonstrated predictive of conversion of patients with MCI
in AD, but not in non-AD dementia (Moretti et al., 2011). The
same increase of a3/a2 power ratio was found to be
correlated with hippocampal atrophy in subjects with AD
(Moretti et al., 2012). For these previous findings, the a3/a2
power ratio analysis has been focused on in the present study.
In the present study, the association of EEG index with GM
changes in thalamus and basal ganglia has been studied in
subjects with MCI. The working hypothesis was that modifica-
tions of the EEG marker could be underpinned by specific deep
brain structures, unveiling the possibility to identify different
MCI populations. Results show that subjects with higher a3/a2
ratios when compared with subjects with lower and middle a3/
a2 ratios showed minor atrophy in the ventral stream of basal
ganglia (head of caudate nuclei and accumbens nuclei
bilaterally) and of the pulvinar nuclei in the thalamus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
For the present study, 74 subjects with MCI were recruited
from the memory IRCCS (Clinic of the Scientific Institute for
Research and Care) of Alzheimer's and psychiatric diseases
`Fatebenefratelli' in Brescia. The data of same subjects were
used in previously published works of our group (Moretti et al.,
2009a,b,c). All experimental protocols had been approved by
the local Ethics Committee. Informed consent was obtained
from all participants or their caregivers, according to the Code
of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of

Helsinki). The research was undertaken with the understanding
and written consent of each participant.
Diagnostic criteria
Patients were taken from a prospective project on the na-
tural history of MCI. The project was aimed to study the
natural history of non-demented persons with apparently
primary cognitive deficits, i.e. deficits not due to psychic
(anxiety, depression etc.) or physical (hypothyroidism, vitamin
B12 and folate deficiency, uncontrolled heart disease,
uncontrolled diabetes etc.) conditions.
Patients were rated with a series of standardized diagnostic
and severity instruments, including the MMSE (Mini-Mental
State Examination; Folstein et al., 1975), the CDRS (Clinical
Dementia Rating Scale; Hughes et al., 1982), the HIS (Hachinski
Ischemic Scale ; Rosen et al., 1980) and the IADL and BADL
(Instrumental Activities of Daily Living and Basic Activities of
Daily Living; Lawton and Brodie, 1969). In addition, patients
underwent diagnostic neuroimaging procedures (MRI), and
laboratory testing to rule out other causes of cognitive
impairment. These inclusion and exclusion criteria for MCI were
based on previous seminal studies (Petersen et al., 2001; Portet
et al., 2006; Geroldi et al., 2006; Dubois et al., 2007). Inclusion
criteria of the study were all of the following: (i) complaint by
the patient or report by a relative or the general practitioner, of
memory or other cognitive disturbances; (ii) MMSE score of 24­
27/30 or MMSE of 28 and higher plus low performance (score of
2­6 or higher) on the clock drawing test (Lezak et al., 2004); (iii)
sparing of IADL and BADL or functional impairment steadily due
to causes other than cognitive impairment, such as physical
impairments, sensory loss, gait or balance disturbances etc.
Exclusion criteria were any one of the following: (i) patients
aged 90 years and older; (ii) history of depression or juvenile-
onset psychosis; (iii) history or neurological signs of major
stroke; (iv) other psychiatric diseases, epilepsy, drug addiction,
alcohol dependence; (v) use of psychoactive drugs, including
acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or other drugs enhancing brain
cognitive functions; and (vi) current or previous uncontrolled
or complicated systemic diseases (including diabetes mellitus)
or traumatic brain injuries.
All patients underwent: (i) semi-structured interview with
the patient and ­ whenever possible ­ with another
informant (usually, the patient's spouse or a child of the
patient) by a geriatrician or neurologist; (ii) physical and
neurological examinations; (iii) performance-based tests of
physical function, gait and balance; (iv) neuropsychological
battery assessing memory (Babcock Story Recall-Rey-
Osterrieth Complex Figure, Recall-Auditory-Verbal Learning
Test, immediate and delayed recall; Lezak et al., 2004) verbal
and non-verbal memory, attention and executive functions
(Trail Making Test B, A and B-A; Inverted Motor Learning-
Clock Drawing Test; Lezak et al., 2004), abstract reasoning
thinking (Raven Coloured Progressive Matrices; Lezak et al.,
2004), frontal functions (Inverted Motor Learning), language
(Phonological and Semantic fluency-Token test, Lezak et al.,
2004) and apraxia and visuo-constructional abilities (Rey-
Osterrieth Complex Figure, Rey figure copy, Clock Drawing
Test; Lezak et al., 2004); (v) assessment of depressive
symptoms by means of the CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression scale; Radloff, 1977). As the aim of our
study was to evaluate the relationship between GM loss and
a2/a3 or h/c ratios, we did not consider the clinical subtype of
MCI, i.e., amnesic or non-amnesic, single or multiple domains.
EEG recordings
The EEG activity was recorded continuously from 19 sites by
using electrodes set in an elastic cap (Electro-Cap International,
Inc.) and positioned according to the 10­20 international
systems (Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, T3, C3, Cz, C4, T4, T5, P3, Pz,
P4, T6, O1 and O2). The ground electrode was placed in front of
Fz. The left and right mastoids served as reference for all
electrodes. The recordings were used off-line to re-reference the
scalp recordings to the common average. Data were recorded
with a band-pass filter of 0.3­70 Hz, and digitized at a sampling
rate of 250 Hz (BrainAmp, BrainProducts). Electrodes­skin
impedance was set below 5 kV. Horizontal and vertical eye
movements were detected by recording the EOG (electrooculo-
gram). The recording lasted 5 min, with subjects with closed
eyes. Longer recordings would have reduced the variability of
the data, but they would also have increased the possibility
of slowing of EEG oscillations due to reduced vigilance and
arousal. EEG data were then analysed and fragmented offline in
consecutive epochs of 2 s, with a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz.
The average number of epochs analysed was 140 ranging from
130 to 150. The EEG epochs with ocular, muscular and other
types of artefact were preliminarily identified by a computerized
automatic procedure (Moretti et al., 2003). Two expert
electroencephalographists manually double-checked and con-
firmed the automatic selections. The epochs with ocular,
muscular and other types of artefacts were discarded. We are
confident about the stationarity of EEG signal in our traces. Our
recordings were performed at rest state, without any external
stimulation that could bias the signal, maintaining the
stochastic nature of spontaneous ongoing EEG. Moreover, it is
widely accepted that the duration of a so-called quasi-
stationary interval of continuous EEG recordings is expected
not to exceed 2­4 s (Kaplan, 1999), but some authors found
much longer fragments of even 12 s (Cohen and Sances, 1977),
25 s (Kawabata, 1976) or 40­60 s (McEwen and Anderson 1975)
to be approximately stationary. Of note, our spectral analysis has
been evaluated on 2 s epoch in each subject. Finally, the spectral
power was averaged across all electrodes to obtain sort of global
field power, which would have reduced the channel-to-channel
variability, with the advantage to extract a high stationary
measure. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the analysis of
the EEG recording in frequency domain (i.e. power spectra)
results in high stationary signal (Kipin
´ski et al., 2011). Anyway
as a control analysis, the stability of the EEG signal was tested as
follows: the power spectra of ten epochs lasting 2 s each were
averaged both at the beginning at the end of the free-artefact

EEG trace of any subjects, since testing for stationarity of the
variability of trial-to-trial power spectra required equal time
intervals between consecutive observations (Kipin
´ski et al.,
2011). ANOVA showed no statistical difference (P50.2) between
the beginning and the ending epochs in each subject and among
all subjects.
Analysis of individual frequency bands
All recordings were obtained in the morning with subjects resting
comfortably. Vigilance was continuously monitored in order to
avoid drowsiness. A digital FFT-based power spectrum analysis
(Welch technique, Hanning windowing function, no phase shift)
computed-ranging from 2 to 45 Hz­the power density of EEG
rhythms with a 0.5 Hz frequency resolution. Two anchor
frequencies were selected according to the literature guidelines
(Klimesch, 1997, 1999), that is, the h/a TF (transition frequency)
and the IAF (individual a frequency) peak. The TF marks the TF
between the h and a bands and represents an estimate of the
frequency at which the h and a spectra intersect. TF was
computed as the minimum power in the a frequency range, since
our EEG recordings were performed at rest. The IAF represents
the frequency with the maximum power peak within the
extended a range (5­14 Hz). Based on TF and IAF, we estimated
the frequency band range for each subject, as follows: d from TF-
4 to TF-2, h from TF-2 to TF, low a band (a1 and a2) from TF to
IAF and high a band (or a3) from IAF to IAF+2. The a1 and a2
bands were computed for each subject as follows: a1 from TF to
the middle point of the TF­IAF range, and a2 from such middle
point to the IAF peak (Moretti et al., 2004, 2007a,b; 2008a,b;
2009a,b,c). Moreover, individual b and c frequencies were
computed. Three frequency peaks were detected in the frequency
range from the individual a3 frequency band and 45 Hz. These
peaks were named b1 (IBF 1), b2 (IBF 2) and c (IGF). Based on
peaks, the frequency ranges were determined. b1 ranges from a3
to the lower spectral power value between b1 and b2 peak; b2
frequency ranges from b1 to the lower spectral power value
between b2 and c peak; c frequency ranges from b2 to 45 Hz,
which is the end of the range considered. Moreover, within h
frequency, the frequency peak ITF (individual theta frequency)
was also individuated. The mean frequency ranges computed in
MCI subjects considered as a whole are: d 2.9­4.9 Hz; h 4.9­
6.9 Hz; a1 6.9­8.9 Hz; a2 8.9­10.9 Hz; a3 10.9­12.9 Hz; b1
12.9­19.2 Hz; b2 19.2­32.4; c 32.4­45. Finally, in the frequency
bands determined on an individual basis, we computed the
relative power spectra for each subject. The relative power
density for each frequency band was computed as the ratio
between the absolute power and the mean power spectra from 2
to 45 Hz. The relative band power at each band was defined as
the mean of the relative band power for each frequency bin
within that band. The a3/a2 and h/c ratio was computed in all
subjects. Three groups were obtained according to increasing
tertile values of a3/a2: low (a3/a2,1); middle (1,a3/a2,1.16);
and high (a3/a2.1.17). A tertile subdivision was chosen in which
each tertile is statistical significantly different from others. It
should be possible to obtain three groups with equal size or only
two groups, but the analysis of the results would be less sensible
as compared with three groups, whose average values were
significantly different from each other.
MRI scans
For each subject, a high-resolution sagittal T1 weighted
volumetric MR scan was acquired by using a 1.0 T Philips
Gyroscan scanner, with a gradient echo 3D technique:
TR520 ms, TE55 ms, flip angle530, field of view5220 mm,
acquisition matrix 2566256, slice thickness 1.3 mm.
The pattern of GM atrophy was studied using the VBM
(voxel-based morphometry) technique (Ashburner, 2007).
Voxel-based morphometry
The 3D images were processed through the SPM5 software
package (Statistical Parametric Mapping, Version 5; Welcome
Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK; http://
www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), running on Matlab 7.0.1 (Math-
Works). DICOM files were converted into ANALYZE format
image, the extra-cranial voxels were removed and the AC
(anterior commissure) was manually set for all images as the
origin of the spatial coordinates for an anatomical normal-
ization algorithm implemented in SPM. Converted files were
then segmented into GM and white matter and normalized to
the GM population templates, generated from the complete
image set, using the DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical
Registration using Exponentiated Lie) algebra registration
method (Ashburner, 2007). This non-linear warping technique
minimizes between-subject structural variations.
Spatially normalized images were modulated by the Jacobian
determinants derived from the spatial normalization to ensure
that the overall amount of each tissue class was not altered by
the spatial normalization procedure. The final voxel resolution
after DARTEL was 1.561.561.5 mm. Finally, each modulated,
warped GM image was transformed to MNI space and smoothed
with an 8 mm FWHM (full-width at half-maximum) Gaussian
kernel filter. The experimenter performing the MRN computa-
tions was blinded to the results of previous EEG works so that
there were not biases in the analysis.
Statistical analysis
VBM results were assessed at an uncorrected threshold of
P,0.001. This threshold has an important limit in that it
allows the type I statistical error. Anyway, a more permissive
threshold could be more adequate to this explorative study,
in order to avoid the b (or type II) statistic error, with the risk
to neglect interesting results. The power of the study was
allowed by size of the sample and by the robust results of the
subsequent analyses. The sample was disaggregated into
three groups according to three increasing values of a3/a2
ratio: low-a3/a2 (a3/a2,1), middle-a3/a2 (1,a3/a2,1.16),
high-a3/a2 (a3/a2.1.17).

Voxel-based analyses were carried out first comparing the
three patient groups with increasing values of the a3/a2 ratio
(high-a3/a2; middle-a3/a2; low-a3/a2).
For each EEG group, between-group regional differences in
GM volumes were assessed by using an ANCOVA model,
modelling the effects of groups (high, middle, low) and
parametric nuisance covariates (age, gender, education,
MMSE scores as covariates). For continuous variables, post-
hoc pairwise comparisons among groups were performed
with the Games-Howell or Bonferroni tests depending on
homogeneity of variance tested with Levene's test.
Moreover, the TIV (total intracranial volume) was intro-
duced in the statistical analysis as a covariate to avoid the
confounding item of the global cortical atrophy. The TIV was
computed by manually tracing the entire intracranial cavity
on 7 mm thick coronal slices, by the use of the software
DISPLAY 1.3 tools.
All the analyses were restricted to the thalamus and basal
ganglia as regions of interest in order to focus on the
relationship between the brain areas and EEG markers. It
should be possible to perform a computation encompassing
other brain areas, but this was beyond the scope of the
present work. Moreover, the relationship of EEG markers with
hippocampus and amygdala was addressed previously
(Moretti et al., 2009b). For this purpose, a mask including
caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, accumbens
nucleus and thalamus was entered into the models as explicit
mask. It was manually traced, through the software MRIcroN,
on the previous template generated from the complete image
set.
The detection of the anatomical regions was based on the
localization of the thalamic nuclei and basal ganglia in
histological sections from a human atlas (Mai et al., 1997).
RESULTS
EEG a3/a2 ratio
Low-a3/a2 group
Subjects with low a3/a2 ratio exhibited a region of GM more
atrophic than subjects with high a3/a2 ratios located in the
head of caudate, specifically in the ventral part and
accumbens nuclei bilaterally, slightly wider on the right side
(see Figure 1).
No regions of GM tissue loss were found when patients
with low a3/a2 ratio were compared with those with middle
a3/a2 ratio.
Middle-a3/a2 group
Subjects with middle a3/a2 ratio, contrasted with individuals
with high a3/a2 ratios, showed the same cerebral atrophic areas
observed in the previous contrast (low a3/a2 compared with high
a3/a2 ratio) including the bilateral head of caudate. Specifically,
the GM loss was located in the medial, ventral caudate and
accumbens nuclei on the right brain hemisphere, whereas the
atrophy was restricted to the ventral part of caudate and in
the accumbens nucleus on the left one (see Figure 2).
No regions of significant GM tissue loss were found in
other comparisons in this group.
DISCUSSION
Preliminary remarks
In this study, we have considered the GM changes of deep
brain structures, basal ganglia and thalamus, based on brain
electrical activity markers. As a consequence, the analysis of
anatomical structural changes in MCI patients was EEG
marker driven. This is a crucial point for considering the
results of the present study. Indeed, it is not a simple
detection of atrophy pattern between two clinically different
populations of subjects, but it would investigate the
association of EEG markers with specific GM changes of
thalamus and basal ganglia in subpopulations of subjects
with MCI in order to detect biomarkers (morphophysiological)
early predictive of AD and non-AD dementia. The a3/a2
frequency ratio has been chosen for two principal reasons: (1)
previous studies demonstrated their association with import-
ant anatomical substrates for atrophy, namely the hippocam-
pus for a3/a2 (Moretti et al., 2009b); and (2) a previous study
has demonstrated that those EEG indexes have different
diagnostic and prognostic value: the increase in a3/a2 ratio is
associated with the conversion of MCI subjects in AD (Moretti
et al., 2009c). Moreover, the increase of this EEG index has
been previously correlated with impairment in psychometric
tests in MCI subjects (Moretti et al., 2009a,b). Of note, the
present results derive from comparisons within masked
regions along with relatively liberal statistical thresholds.
This implies that these findings need to be confirmed by
further studies with larger size patient populations. On the
other hand, the presence of a peculiar pattern of association
between EEG and MRI markers in a subgroup of MCI subjects
could be useful in the comprehension of anatomo-physio-
logical underpinning of the MCI entity. Indeed, in the
previous studies published by our group, the increase of a3/
a2 ratio was associated with a decrease (or atrophy) of the
hippocampal volume. On the contrary, in the present study,
the a3/a3 ratio is associated with a bigger volume (or minor
atrophy) in the basal ganglia and thalamus.
Association between EEG markers and GM
changes
The increase of a3/a2 ratio is associated with minor atrophy
of caudate nuclei, accumbens nuclei in the basal ganglia,

and of the pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus. These results
confirm previous studies on AD patients, showing both basal
ganglia and thalamic involvement in AD (de Jong et al., 2008;
Canu et al., 2010; Cherubini et al., 2010; Zarei et al., 2010).
The principal difference with the most of the other studies is
that they reported a greater atrophy of thalamus and basal
ganglia. There are some possible explanations: (1) the EEG-
driven evaluation of atrophy, focusing on specific morpho-
structural features of patients, have magnified only some GM
patterns; (2) previous observed atrophy patterns could be
linked to specific regressive processes due to aging (Cabeza

Anatomo-physiological relationship between
EEG markers and GM changes
Our results show the presence of different patterns of GM
changes associated with EEG marker. This could suggest
the existence of specific neural networks underlying the
degenerative disease. We suggest an interesting, although
speculative, hypothesis that could explain the novelty
emerging from our results. A ventral stream, encompassing
striatum (ventral caudate nuclei), and accumbens nuclei
together with pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus, seems to be
less affected in MCI patients who will develop AD. The
relatively preserved anatomical structure could suggest a state
of compensatory hyperfunction of this circuitry, determining
both cognitive and psychiatric symptoms of prodromal AD
(Spalletta et al., 2010). Indeed, the ventral caudate and
accumbens nuclei are related to the regulation of emotional

control function, in particular with the impulsivity and fear
behaviour control (Basar et al., 2010). In turn, the pulvinar
nuclei are involved in cognitive visuo-spatial function (Berman
and Wurtz, 2010). The brain electrical activity marker of these
structural changes is represented by the increase of a3/a2
ratio. This could be due to the prevalence of an anterior circuit
impinging on anterior cingulate cortex, ventral (limbic)
striatum and orbito-frontal cortex, relatively spared (in the
initial time of disease) in prodromal AD patients. The disrupture
of the posterior circuit, encompassing hippocampal cortex,
posterior cingulate, precuneus, posterior parietal cortices, will
give rise to the decrease of low a (a2 in our analysis) rhythm,
whereas the dominance of an anterior circuit gives rise to the
increase of high a. This explanation is supported by two well-
known neurophysiological phenomena in AD: (1) the decrease
of power of the dominant a rhythm on posterior cerebral
areas; and (2) the so-called `anteriorization' of a frequency
(Klimesch et al., 2007). The anterior a is higher in frequency for
two possible reasons: (1) the lack of large areas to synchronize,
as the posterior sibling usually does; and (2) the association
with attentive phenomena, more than with visuo-spatial
analysis, usually related to higher a rhythm (Klimesch, 1999).
The lack of results in the comparison between middle and
low ratios of a3/a2 is counterintuitive and puzzling to be
interpreted. The most plausible reason is that the neurophy-
siological phenomena become evident when the atrophy of
deep GM nuclei reaches a threshold level, highlighting the
strength of the EEG markers-guided analysis in a prognostic
view. Indeed, the other groups could present MCI subjects
that will remain stable or with depression or with prevalent
cerebrovascular disease.
Anatomo-physiological implications at network
level
Ventral stiatum (ventral caudate and accumbens nuclei) is a
key entry point structure for afferent information from the
periphery as well as for afferents and efferents of wider
CSPTC (cortico­striatal­pallido­thalamo­cortical functionally
segregated loops; Kopell and Greenberg, 2008). Of note, this
network has peculiar functions within the loop associated
with characteristic modulation effects.
The ventral striatum/accumben complex is related to
orbito-frontal cortex and is involved in the weighting of
stimuli in the reward against punishment evaluation.
Moreover, these structures provide a vital link between the
internal state of emotion and the external state of motor
behaviour (Kopell and Greenberg, 2008; Haber and Knutson,
2010). The involvement of pulvinar nuclei is well associated
with visuo-spatial associative function as well as with a
modulation of the limbic system through the connection
between medial pulvinar and the amygdala (Berman and
Wurtz, 2010).
There are some limitations due to the explorative nature
of the present study: (1) the lack of the estimation of other
EEG frequencies; and (2) the lack of the estimation of
synchrony or coherence measures (see also Dauwels et al.,
2009). Anyway, along the conceptual frame of the study,
both of them need to be associated with morpho-structural
parameters. These aspects need to be addressed in future
studies.
Previous studies, facing the neural network connectivity
issue, using fMRI and PET as well as EEG, demonstrate that
connectivity of brain activity is altered in AD and correlates
with cognitive deficits (Bokde et al., 2009). Grady et al.
suggested a functional disconnection between the hippocam-
pus and the frontal cortices in the AD patients, and that the
disconnection was underlying the memory deficit in the AD
patients (Grady et al., 2001, 2003). On the other hand, a
hyperactivation of memory networks was found in subjects
with MCI with clinical memory impairment (Dickerson et al.,
2005; Bokde et al., 2008, 2009). Our present results could
offer a possible comprehensive explanation. As a speculative
hypothesis, it could be possible that in MCI subjects at risk to
develop AD, discrete networks prevail on long-range net-
works (disconnection theory). At the same time, the survival
of hyperactive, although short-range, networks permit the
maintenance of a normal performance (compensation
theory), at least in the early phases of disease.
Conclusion
The integrated analysis of EEG and morpho-structural
markers could be useful in the comprehension of anatomo-
physiological underpinning of the MCI entity.
