Profile of Home Care Aides, Nursing Home
Aides, and Hospital Aides: Historical Changes
and Data Recommendations
Yoshiko Yamada, MSW1
Purpose: To examine demographic characteristics and
work conditions of home care aides, nursing home aides,
and hospital aides in the late 1980s and late 1990s.
Design and Methods: This study replicated a previous
study which examined the Current Population Survey
(CPS) March supplement from 1987 to 1989. The present
study examined CPS data from 1997 to 1999 both to ob-
tain a profile of aides in the late 1990s and to compare
1990's work conditions and demographic characteristics
with those of aides in the late 1980s. Results: Whereas
demographic characteristics and work conditions of hos-
pital and nursing home aides show little change over the
decade, home care aides today are generally younger,
more educated, more likely to hold full-time positions, and
more likely to have health benefits than their counterparts
10 years ago. Yet work conditions are still poorer for
home care aides than for the other types of aides.
Implications: Work conditions need further improvement,
particularly for home care aides. More accurate data to
describe paraprofessional care workers are also neces-
sary to address the serious worker shortage problems.

care aides, Paraprofessionals
The United States has been facing a serious short-
age of direct care workers in long-term care settings in
the last few decades. Several factors, including the ag-
ing population and changes in health care systems,
have resulted in a dramatic increase in the demand for
direct care workers. The combination of persistent
worker shortages, increasing demands, and record-
low unemployment rates has exacerbated the short-
ages of direct care workers in the late 1990s. A recent
nationwide survey found that for 42 states recruit-
ment and retention of paraprofessional aide workers
was a major workforce issue in 1999 (North Carolina
Division of Facility Services, 1999). Another study,
composed of 86 telephone interviews of a variety of
long-term care providers in New York state, found
that the direct care worker shortage has hit all set-
tings, including 92% of nursing homes, 82% of home
health agencies, and 70% of adult care facilities
(New York Association of Homes and Services for the
Aging, 2000).
Previous studies suggest that recruitment and re-
tention of direct care workers are closely associated
with a number of factors, including workers' demo-
graphic characteristics, work conditions, organizational
culture, and macroeconomic conditions (Banaszak-Holl
& Hines, 1996; Friedman, Daub, Crisci, & Keyser,
1999; Gilbert, 1991; Halbur, 1983; Hill Simonton
Bell, 1998; Kiyak, Namazi, & Kahana, 1997; Wax-
man, Carner, & Berkenstock, 1984). However, little
is known about these workers, such as basic demo-
graphic characteristics and work conditions. Most
existing studies profiling the characteristics of para-
professional care workers are limited to particular
agencies or local areas with very limited generaliz-
ability (Crown, Ahlburg, & MacAdam, 1995). Since
those variables appear to affect recruitment and re-
tention of the paraprofessional care workforce, accu-
rate information gathering and reporting on key char-
acteristics of these workers are essential to identify
strategies to address this growing labor shortage
problem.
The only studies with nationally representative
samples of direct care workers were undertaken by
Leon and Franco (1998) and Crown and colleagues
(1995). Leon and Franco developed a profile of agency-
based and self-employed home health care workers at
a national level. They conducted telephone interviews
with 623 home care workers identified by the respon-
dents of the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey
(MCBS). Despite the seemingly sufficient sample size,
Leon and Franco (1998) pointed out that the response
rate was lower than preferred (1,368 MCBS clients

were originally contacted) due in part to concurrent
government investigations in the industry and the
high turnover rate among home care workers. Hence,
their estimates should be interpreted with caution.
Another study, conducted by Crown and col-
leagues (1995), compared demographic characteris-
tics and work conditions for three types of aides: hos-
pital aides, nursing home aides, and home care aides.
This study used data from the Current Population
Survey (CPS) March supplement. The CPS is a
monthly survey of about 50,000 households, con-
ducted by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS; BLS, 1996). The sample is rep-
resentative of national civilian noninstitutional popu-
lations aged 15 and older. The March supplement is
the primary source of detailed information on in-
come, work experience, geographic mobility, educa-
tional attainment, and poverty status (BLS, 2001).
Despite difficulties in identifying different types of
aides, particularly home care aides, in the CPS data,
Crown and colleagues' study provides comparisons
of different types of aides.
Given the growing labor force problem, it seems
opportune to examine more recent data and facilitate
comparisons with earlier studies. For these reasons
this study will replicate the approach taken by Crown
and colleagues (1995). This study will also examine
the continued usefulness of the CPS to describe direct
care workers.
Methods
Crown and colleagues (1995) merged 1987,
1988, and 1989 data from the CPS March supple-
ment. The present study used a similar approach
utilizing 1997, 1998, and 1999 data to examine the
demographic characteristics and work conditions of
aides. I compared findings from the 1997­1999
data set with those from the 1987­1989 data set. To
make the variables as consistent as possible with
Crown and colleagues' study, I used the same defi-
nitions to identify the three types of aides from the
CPS data by using the cross tabulation of occupa-
tional (OCC) and industry (IND) codes. Table 1
summarizes the definition of each aide group in the
present study.
The sample size for each type of aides is presented
in Table 2. For the 1990s data, I used chi-squared for
categorical variables (e.g., marital status, educational
attainment), and analysis of variance for quantita-
tive variables (e.g., income, wages). Because the 1980s
data were available only in the aggregated form, I
conducted no statistical tests to compare the signif-
icance of differences in data for the two different
time periods.
Results
Demographic Characteristics
Table 2 provides demographic characteristics of
nursing home aides, home care aides, and hospital
aides. The age distributions of each occupation group
show that home care aides tended to be older than
both nursing home and hospital aides in both the late
1980s and 1990s. However, the mean age of home
care aides declined in the 10 year period. As for gen-
der distribution, although the proportion of males in-
creased somewhat in the nursing home and home care
industries during the 1990s, the direct care workforce
is still predominantly female. Hospital aides who
work as orderlies may be a possible explanation for
the higher proportion of males in hospital settings
(Crown et al., 1995).
Racial distributions did not change dramatically
in the last decade, and the 1990s data showed no sig-
nificant differences in racial characteristics among
the occupations. However, the data showed that
home care aides were significantly less likely to be
native-born U.S. citizens than were nursing home
and hospital aides in the late 1990s. The late 1990s
data also showed that nursing home aides were more
likely (52%) to have children younger than age 18
than were home care aides (40%) or hospital aides
(46%).
There were consistent differences in educational at-
tainment among the occupation groups in the two pe-
riods studied. Despite overall improvement in educa-
tional attainment in the last decade, home care aides
still have less education than other aides. Yet it should
also be noted that almost one third of nursing home
aides and home care aides now have at least some col-
lege education, which seems contrary to the public
perception of aides.

Work Experience
Table 3 reports labor force participation for the
three types of aides. Although the proportions of full-
time, full-year aides did not change for hospital and
nursing home aides, home care aides were more likely
to work full time and full year in the 1990s (46%)
than in the late 1980s (29%). Even in the late 1990s,
however, home care aides were still less likely to work
full time and full year than nursing home aides (55%)
and hospital aides (63%). Home care aides were also
somewhat more likely to work part time and part
year (16%) than nursing home aides (11%) and hos-
pital aides (8%). Whereas more than half of part-time
hospital aides (54%) and nursing home aides (50%)
said they wanted part-time jobs, only 42% of part-
time home care aides reported a preference for part-time
jobs. Similarly, part-time home care aides were more
likely (18%) than hospital aides (12%) and nursing
home aides (14%) to report that they could only find
part-time jobs. Although the differences in reasons
for being part-time workers were not statistically sig-
nificant (p  .286), one should not ignore the fact
that a significant minority of home care aides would
have preferred a full-time job but worked part time
involuntarily.
The number of weeks worked per year and the
weekly work hours for each occupation did not
change dramatically. In the late 1990s, home care
aides spent fewer weeks (41) at work than nursing
home aides (43) and hospital aides (46), reflecting the
higher proportion of part-year workers. Consistent
with the 1980s data, data from the late 1990s also
showed no statistically significant difference in the av-
erage work hours per week. Data from the 1990s also
showed that home care aides were somewhat more
likely to have earnings from other work (23%) than
were nursing home aides (20%) and hospital aides

(16%). Hence, as Crown and colleagues (1995) sug-
gested, many home care aides seemed to hold more
than one job and work full-time hours but without
the benefits of full-time status.
One puzzling finding is that despite the increase in
home care aides who work full time and full year, the
average number of weeks worked per year and hours
usually worked per week declined slightly in the de-
cade studied. Although there is no definite explana-
tion for this finding, one possibility is that home care
aides are more likely now than 10 years ago to have
one full-time full-year job instead of two part-time
jobs. Hence, the increasing proportion of full-time full-
year home care aides did not necessarily result in an
increasing number of weeks and hours worked. An-
other possible explanation is the decline of work
weeks and hours among part-time workers in the last
decade, which may have brought down the mean
number of weeks and hours worked. Future research
is needed to test these hypotheses.
Wages and Income
Table 4 shows wages, earnings, and family income
for different types of aides. Wages and income in the
1980s are adjusted to 1998 dollars based on the Con-
sumer Price Index (all items) to make for easier com-
parison. The table shows that, except for mean hourly
wages, wages and income of home care aides in-
creased slightly in the last 10 years, whereas those of

nursing home aides and hospital aides declined in the
same time period. The decline was particularly steep
among hospital aides. Nonetheless, hospital aides
continue to have the highest wages, annual earnings,
and family incomes, followed by nursing home aides
and home care aides. As Crown and colleagues
(1995) pointed out, wage information in the CPS is
available only for a minority of the sample, which
could be problematic. (Only a 25% subsample of
workers reported their wages in the 1980s, compared
with a 20% subsample in the 1990s). Nonetheless,
the reported CPS wage data are similar to data
from the Occupational Employment Statistics, a
larger survey with wage data conducted by the BLS.
The 1990s data also presented a poverty ratio for
each occupation. The poverty ratio is a ratio of in-
come to the poverty level. For example, a poverty
ratio of 1.00 is equal to the poverty level, and a ratio
of 2.00 is equal to 200% of the poverty level. Com-
pared to average national poverty rates of 12 to 13%
in 1998 and 1999 (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000), nurs-
ing home aides and home care aides have much higher
poverty rates of 16% and 22%, respectively. An addi-
tional 29% of nursing home aides and 25% of home
care aides live near the poverty level (i.e., poverty
ratios between 1.00 and 1.99). In contrast, only 9%
of hospital aides live below the poverty level, and al-
most one half of them have a poverty ratio that is
3.00 and above.
Fringe Benefits
Differences in availability of fringe benefits among
the occupations as well as over time are shown in
Table 5. Whereas the proportions of health insurance
provided by current employers or unions did not
change in the decade studied for nursing home aides
(approximately 40%) and hospital aides (approxi-
mately 60%), a growing proportion of home care
aides now receive health insurance through their em-
ployment (14% in the 1980s and 26% in the 1990s).
This growth may reflect the increasing availability of
full-time positions for home care aides. Yet compared
with the other two occupations, home care aides are
still substantially less likely to receive health insur-
ance from their employers or unions, and are more
likely to receive health insurance through government
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.
Table 5 also shows that the nursing homes and hos-
pitals that provide health insurance to their employ-
ees are less likely now than they were 10 years ago to
pay all of the premium, while home care employers
are more likely now than a decade ago to do so.
Nonetheless, it should also be noted that about 1 in
every 11 nursing home and home care employers who
provide health insurance do not pay any premium.
Considering the low income of nursing home and
home care aides, it is very likely that such benefits are
out of reach for these aides without financial support
from employers.
As for pension coverage, nursing homes and hospi-
tals showed a slight increase in pension provision by
employers in the last 10 years, while the proportion
stayed the same for home care providers. Hospitals
were substantially more likely (72% in the 1990s) to
provide pensions for aides than nursing homes (44%)
and home care providers (24%).

istics and work conditions over the last 10 years, the
picture looks quite different for home care aides.
Compared to the late 1980s, home care aides in the
late 1990s were younger, more educated, and more
likely to have children. Also, home care providers
were more likely to offer full-time/full-year jobs and
health insurance for aides in the late 1990s than in the
late 1980s. Nevertheless, compared to nursing home
aides and hospital aides, home care aides are still less
likely to hold full-time jobs and receive benefits.
Home care aides are also more likely than other aides
to be poor and to hold more than one job. Moreover,
despite the real wage decline among hospital and
nursing home aides and the slight wage increase
among home care aides, data showed that hospital
aides still tend to have the best paying and benefited
jobs and home care aides have the least. Given the
growing and continuing labor shortages for nursing
home aide and home care aide positions, these data
confirm the need to improve work conditions for
long-term care aide workers.
Wage and benefits are not the only factors contrib-
uting to recruitment and retention of aide workers.
As mentioned before, studies have found a number
of nonmonetary factors that are closely associated
with turnover rates of care aides. These studies do
not negate the potential to improve recruitment and
retention of care aides through individual employers'
efforts to address these issues. However, research
also shows that a significant proportion of care aides
who have left or who are considering leaving their
jobs reported money and benefits as reasons for job
resignation (Gilbert, 1991; Hill Simonton Bell, 1998).
There is also evidence that programs that provided
additional benefits, such as a career ladder with en-
hanced status and wages, more affordable benefits,
and guaranteed hours, improved retention of care
aides (Feldman, 1993; Gunsch, 1993; Mlynarek &
Mondoux, 1996; Moffatte, Stefanini, & Hardke-
Peck, 2000).
Addressing wages and benefits appears to be criti-
cal. However, employers argue that they have very
limited control over wages and benefits because the
government is the major payer of nursing home and
home health care costs. In 1998, 53% of home health
care expenditures and 60% of nursing home expendi-
tures were paid through public funds, mostly from
Medicare and Medicaid (Health Care Financing Ad-
ministration, 2000). Hence, wages and benefits for
care aides are largely influenced by public health care
reimbursement policies. Several states have passed
legislation to address the labor shortage in the long-
term care workforce. As of 1999, 16 states had ap-
proved or implemented some form of a wage pass
through (WPT), which mandates that certain amounts
or percentages of the increased reimbursement for
Medicaid and/or state long-term care programs be
given to care paraprofessionals as wages and/or ben-
efits. By 2000, at least two additional states had
started to implement WPT (North Carolina Division
of Facility Services, 1999, 2000). However, WPT is
such a new initiative in most of the states that its im-
pact on recruitment and retention of care workers
cannot yet be judged (North Carolina Division of Fa-
cility Services, 2000).
The data also suggest that a significant minority of
home care aides is not U.S. citizens. Some observers
have suggested that federal policy makers reconsider
current restrictions on immigration to increase the
supply of direct care workers (New York Association
of Homes and Services for the Aging, 2000). This ap-
proach may be particularly effective in addressing the
shortage of home care aides, considering the higher
proportion of noncitizen workers than for the other
two types of aides. Although fewer limitations on im-
migration may solve the labor problems in the short
term, this strategy may not address the fundamental
problems identified in this study for direct care workers:
low pay and poor benefits. Because immigrants are
more likely to accept lower-paying jobs with poor
benefits, there is even a danger that the growth of
noncitizen care aides will lead to even lower wages
and poorer benefits.
Limitations of the Present Study and CPS
Data Set and Recommendations
In this study, paraprofessional care workers were
identified in the CPS March supplement based on oc-
cupation and industry codes. Although CPS is one of
the few national data sets that provides valuable na-
tionally representative data on various occupations,
there are several data limitations. Crown and col-
leagues (1995) pointed out that because the CPS in-
dustry and occupation codes were not sufficiently
well defined, some aides may have been excluded
and people who are not aides may have been in-
cluded. Although Crown and colleagues (1995) be-
lieved that the misclassifications were small in num-
ber, closer examination in the present study found
potential problems in both occupation and industry
codes in CPS related to the study of direct care
workers.
First, CPS data set does not distinguish between oc-
cupation codes for home health aides, who provide
assistance with both activities of daily living and
instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and per-
sonal care aides, who mainly provide IADL assistance.
According to the BLS's Occupational Employment
Statistics (n.d.), personal care aides make much less
money per hour (average $7.40) than home health
aides (average $8.08). Hence, the CPS data may be
missing this potentially significant distinction. An-
other potential problem in CPS occupation codes is
the inclusion of orderlies in the same occupation
group as nursing aides. The present study found a
higher proportion of males in hospital settings, which
is perhaps a result of the inclusion of orderlies as care
workers. However, orderlies tend to have a different
nature of work and different demographic character-
istics. By mixing dissimilar groups of workers, the
survey data may not provide precise pictures of each
occupation.
As for the industry codes, the CPS data set
205
Vol. 42, No. 2, 2002
combines several long-term care settings with other
industries, which makes it harder to identify parapro-
fessional care workers in relevant settings. For exam-
ple, identification of paraprofessional care workers in
relatively new residential settings for the elderly,
such as assisted living facilities, is extremely diffi-
cult in the current CPS industry coding system. The
number of assisted living facilities has increased
dramatically in the last decade, but the CPS data
set does not provide a clear definition of what in-
dustry category the aides in those facilities should
belong to (e.g., residential care, nursing and per-
sonal care facilities). As assisted living facilities
generally rely much less on government funding
(e.g., Medicare, Medicaid) than other health and
long-term care providers, the employers may have
more freedom to improve the work conditions of
staff, including care aides.
Another problem with the CPS industry codes is
that home health care agencies, which are the major
employers of home care aides, are combined with
several other industries in CPS industry codes (IND
840). Despite the fact that most of the direct care
workers in the IND 840 belong to home care agen-
cies (BLS, n.d.), the present study does not include
health aides (OCC 446) and nursing aides (OCC
447) in the IND 840, which may have resulted in
underrepresentation of agency-based home care
aides in the present study. Another limitation, more
of the present study than the CPS data itself, is the
lack of adequate definitions of home care aides. For
the purpose of data consistency in the two time pe-
riods, the present study used the same occupation
and industry codes as Crown and colleagues (1995)
to define the three groups of aides. As Table 1 shows,
although the CPS has separate industry codes for pri-
vate-duty (IND 761) and agency-based (e.g., IND
840, 861, 871, 880) home care aides, the present
study made no distinctions. Leon and Franco (1998)
found that agency-based and self-employed home
care workers showed differences in some demo-
graphic characteristics and working conditions.
Hence, distinctions between agency-based and self-
employed home care workers may be critical to un-
derstanding home care workers in different settings.
In short, the present study has two limitations in
defining home care aides: not including workers who
are employed by home care agencies, and not distin-
guishing between agency-based and self-employed
workers. In order to make the best use of the existing
data set, it is recommended that future analyses of
home care aides using CPS include aide workers in
IND 840 (health services, not elsewhere classified)
and separate IND 761 (private home) from other
home care industries.
Research on direct care workers will be greatly fa-
cilitated if care workers are properly distinguished
from other occupations and industries. Therefore,
accurate occupation and industry classification is
critical. The workforce crisis in health and long-term
care should encourage efforts to make more accurate
classifications.
Conclusion
This study examined the characteristics and work
conditions of different types of care aides in the late
1990s and compared this data to similar data from
the late 1980s. Some work-related improvements were
noted but too many care aides are still at or below
poverty level with limited benefits. This is particularly
true for home care aides and, to a lesser degree, for
nursing home aides. Existing national data sets, al-
though useful, were found to be at risk of missing key
groups of workers; this should be considered in
planned revisions of occupation and industry codes.
As worker shortages continue and demand for care
services increases, a number of efforts have been made
at organizational, local, state, and national levels to
improve recruitment and retention of care staff. Yet
without accurate data on current conditions, such ef-
forts may be targeted at the wrong concerns and
issues and may fail to bring the desired results. Con-
tinued attention to systematic data collection about
care workers at various levels (e.g., demographic
characteristics, work conditions, and issues workers
face) seems essential to secure the quantity and
quality of care.
