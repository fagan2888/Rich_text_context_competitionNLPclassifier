Differences in Dietary Intakes in a US Sample of Mexican Americans Dixon et al.
Differences in Energy, Nutrient, and Food Intakes in a US Sample of Mexican-
American Women and Men: Findings from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­1994
Lori Beth Dixon,1 Jan Sundquist,2 and Marilyn Winkleby3
As Mexican-American women and men migrate to the United States and/or become more acculturated, their
diets may become less healthy, increasing their risk of cardiovascular disease. Data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) were used to compare whether energy, nutrient, and food
intakes differed among three groups of Mexican-American women (n = 1,449) and men (n = 1,404) aged 25­64
years: those born in Mexico, those born in the United States whose primary language was Spanish, and those
born in the United States whose primary language was English. Percentages of persons who met the national
dietary guidelines for fat, fiber, and potassium and the recommended intakes of vitamins and minerals
associated with cardiovascular disease were also compared. In general, Mexican Americans born in Mexico
consumed significantly less fat and significantly more fiber; vitamins A, C, E, and B6; and folate, calcium,
potassium, and magnesium than did those born in the United States, regardless of language spoken. More
women and men born in Mexico met the dietary guidelines or recommended nutrient intakes than those born in
the United States. The heart-healthy diets of women and men born in Mexico should be encouraged among all
Mexican Americans living in the United States, especially given the increasing levels of obesity and diabetes
among this rapidly growing group of Americans. Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:548­57.

In the US Hispanic population, cardiovascular disease
(CVD) is the leading cause of death (1, 2). However, risk
factors for CVD (e.g., elevated blood pressure, obesity, cig-
arette smoking, elevated blood cholesterol, non-insulin-
dependent diabetes mellitus) vary greatly among the diverse
subgroups of this population. For example, a recent analysis
of a US sample of Mexican Americans (who comprise two-
thirds of the US Hispanic population) found that those born
in the United States had significantly higher levels of CVD
risk factors than those born in Mexico; furthermore, among
Mexican Americans born in the United States, those who
predominantly spoke Spanish exhibited markedly higher
levels of risk factors than their counterparts who predomi-
nantly spoke English (3). Other studies of different ethnic
groups have reported similar associations of country of birth
(migration status) and language spoken (acculturation sta-
tus) with elevated CVD risk factor levels (4­6).
Changes in diet often occur when groups of people
migrate or become more acculturated, which may influence
their levels of risk factors for CVD (7). For example, sub-
groups of the Hispanic population show distinct differences
in dietary intakes according to country of birth (8, 9), gen-
erational status (10), and primary language spoken (11). In
general, Hispanics born in the United States eat diets higher
in fat and lower in fiber compared with Hispanics born out-
side the United States. Moreover, Hispanics who have lived
in the United States for more than one generation or who are
more acculturated (defined as speaking English) report
higher average intakes of fat and lower average intakes of
fiber than first-generation Hispanics who have stronger ties
to their traditional culture. Previous studies (9, 10, 12, 13),
however, have not shown consistent patterns of vitamin and
mineral intakes among the different subgroups of Hispanics.
These studies also have been limited by small sample sizes
(9) or restricted geographic areas (11­13) or have included
only women (9, 10); thus, they fail to represent the overall
US population. Furthermore, they have not examined level
of acculturation by both country of birth and primary lan-
guage spoken to further differentiate Hispanics living in the
United States today.
Socioeconomic status (SES) often accounts for ethnic dif-
ferences in CVD risk factors, including factors related to
Differences in Dietary Intakes in a US Sample of Mexican Americans 549
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 6, 2000
dietary intake (14­16). However, diet studies of Hispanic
populations that have analyzed SES report inconsistent find-
ings. For example, the San Antonio Heart Study showed that
Hispanic men living in higher SES neighborhoods had
higher fat intakes than Hispanic men living in lower SES
neighborhoods (17). In contrast, the San Luis Valley
Diabetes Study showed that Hispanics whose SES was
higher (as measured by number of years of education) had
lower fat intakes than Hispanics whose SES was lower (18).
Unfortunately, past studies of diet and health that used US
samples have not clarified these inconsistent findings, possi-
bly because they have not accounted for differences in SES.
In the present study, we analyzed dietary data on 2,853
Mexican-American women and men from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
who were differentiated according to country of birth and
primary language spoken: those born in Mexico, those born
in the United States whose primary language was Spanish,
and those born in the United States whose primary language
was English. Our first objective was to compare intakes of
energy and nutrients related to CVD from 24-hour dietary
recalls among the three groups of Mexican Americans, after
adjusting for age and SES (as measured by years of educa-
tion). Our second objective was to determine to what degree
each group met the nationally recommended intakes for
dietary fat, fiber, and selected vitamins and minerals. Our last
objective was to compare the frequencies of intake of foods
reported on a 1-month food frequency questionnaire (FFQ)
among the three groups and to evaluate these qualitative
results in relation to the quantitative nutrient intakes deter-
mined from 24-hour dietary recalls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES III, a large US survey conducted from 1988 to
1994, is a major source of information on the nutritional and
health status of the US civilian population aged 2 months or
more (19) and used the same stratified multistage probability
design as previous National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (20, 21). Mexican Americans were
oversampled to produce statistically reliable health estimates
for the largest ethnic minority group in the United States. The
data were collected via standardized questionnaires adminis-
tered by health professionals at participants' homes; stan-
dardized medical examinations by physicians, medical tech-
nicians, and other health professionals at National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centers;
and laboratory tests on whole blood and sera.
Study sample
The sample for our analyses included 1,449 Mexican-
American women and 1,404 Mexican-American men aged
25­64 years who completed both the home questionnaire
and medical examination. We used age 25 years as our lower
age cutpoint because educational attainment (a covariate in
our multivariate regression models) often is not complete
before this age. Age 64 years was used as our upper age cut-
point to avoid problems regarding selection effects due to
non-CVD-caused morbidity and mortality (22). We
excluded data for respondents who were pregnant (n  63),
those for whom education information was lacking (n 
20), and those whose surveys were coded as unreliable (n 
2). In our analyses of energy and nutrient intakes, we
excluded an additional 141 subjects whose 24-hour dietary
recalls were coded as unreliable and 50 subjects who
reported consuming less than 500 or more than 5,000 total
calories. Respondents who were excluded represented the
three Mexican-American groups defined below.
Definition of variables
Race/ethnicity was based on asking respondents to clas-
sify their ethnicity as Black; Mexican or Mexican American;
White, non-Hispanic; Asian or Pacific Islander; Aleut,
Eskimo, or American Indian; or other Latin American or
other Spanish. Respondents who chose Mexican or Mexican-
American ethnicity were included in our analysis. Migration
status and level of acculturation were indicated, respectively,
by country of birth and primary language spoken at home,
both factors that have shown high levels of validity and reli-
ability (23) and that reflect the strength of cultural beliefs and
practices and influence health status (24). To explore whether
dietary patterns differed according to migration status, level
of acculturation, or both, we divided the respondents into
three groups: those born in Mexico, those born in the United
States whose primary language spoken at home was Spanish,
and those born in the United States whose primary language
spoken at home was English.
Information on educational attainment was collected as a
continuous variable and was defined as the highest number
of years of education completed. We chose years of educa-
tion as our measure of SES because few data tend to be
missing, it remains valid throughout adulthood, and it is
available for persons not employed outside the home (25).
Measurement of diet
Nutrient and food intakes were assessed for the three
groups of Mexican-American women and men by using a
single 24-hour dietary recall and a 1-month qualitative FFQ.
The 24-hour dietary recall was administered by bilingual
Spanish-speaking interviewers at the mobile examination
centers; an automated, interactive interview and coding sys-
tem were used that featured a standardized interview format
and automated probes to obtain detailed information about
foods, including brand names, preparation methods, and
ingredients used in preparation (26). Three-dimensional
food models, measurement aids, and food-specific units
were used to estimate amounts consumed. Not included
were nutrients obtained from nutritional supplements, med-
ications, and seasonings added to prepared foods at the
table. From the 24-hour dietary recall, we determined total
calories, percentage of calories from total fat and saturated
fat, and the following nutrients: cholesterol, fiber, vitamin
A, vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, calcium, potas-
sium, and magnesium. These nutrients were selected
because of their association with CVD (27­29).
550 Dixon et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 6, 2000
The FFQ, administered during the household interview,
was used to ask respondents about the average number of
times foods were eaten during the 1-month period preceding
the interview date. Frequencies of consumption of foods
from the following food groups were ascertained: milk and
milk products, meat and egg dishes, fruits and fruit juices,
vegetables, grains and legumes, desserts, and added fats.
We also determined the percentages of respondents, by
migration status and level of acculturation, who met the US
dietary guidelines (30­32) or recommended intakes of
selected nutrients (33­35). Dietary guidelines included total
fat (30 percent kcal/day), saturated fat (<10 percent
kcal/day), cholesterol (300 mg/day), fiber (25 g/day), and
potassium (3,500 mg/day). Intake of vitamin A was com-
pared with the Recommended Dietary Allowances (33);
vitamin C, vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, calcium, and mag-
nesium were compared with the Dietary Reference Intakes
(34, 35). Percentages of Mexican Americans who reported
taking a vitamin or mineral supplement in the past month
were also determined from a question asked during the
household interview.
Statistical analysis
Primary analyses, using multiple linear regression mod-
els, were carried out with SUDAAN software (version 7.11;
Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) to adjust for the complex sample design of
NHANES III (19). All analyses incorporated sampling
weights that adjusted for unequal probabilities of selection.
Multivariate analyses were conducted separately for men
and women. The dependent variables were energy and nutri-
ent intakes. The independent variables were the three migra-
tion and acculturation groups (Mexican born, US-born
Spanish speaking, and US-born English speaking), educa-
tional attainment (in years, centered at the sample mean for
each gender to aid in interpretation of the regression coeffi-
cients), age (centered at the sample mean for each gender),
and their first-order interactions.
The SAS System for Windows (version 6.12; SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was used to determine the
frequencies of various demographic characteristics, percent-
ages of persons who met the dietary guidelines or recom-
mended intakes of nutrients or who took a vitamin or min-
eral supplement, and frequencies of foods and food groups
reported from the FFQ by the three groups of Mexican
Americans. Sampling weights also were incorporated in
these analyses.
RESULTS
Of the 1,449 women and 1,404 men in our study, those
born in Mexico were more likely to live in urban areas, have
larger families, have lower educational attainment and
higher levels of poverty, perform unskilled labor (e.g., agri-
culture, construction, assembly line), and be without health
insurance than those born in the United States (table 1).
The results of the regression models comparing US-born
Spanish-speaking and US-born English-speaking women
and men with women and men born in Mexico, adjusted for
education and age, are shown in table 2. While there were no
significant differences in energy intake among the three

groups of women, the men born in Mexico had a signifi-
cantly higher energy intake than the two groups of US-born
men. There were significant differences in nutrient intakes
by migration status; women and men born in Mexico
showed more healthful nutrient intakes than US-born
women and men, regardless of acculturation status. For
women, the percentage of calories from total fat and satu-
rated fat was lower for those born in Mexico, except for US-
born Spanish-speaking women, whose percentage of calo-
ries from saturated fat was not significantly different. The
percentage of calories from monounsaturated fat also was
lower for women born in Mexico, but the percentage of
calories from polyunsaturated fat did not differ among the
three groups of women (data not shown). The results for
men were similar, with the exception of US-born English-
speaking men, whose percentage of calories from total fat
was not significantly different. The only significant differ-
ence regarding cholesterol was found for US-born English-
speaking men, whose intakes were lower than those of their
counterparts.
Paralleling the lower intakes of fat among women and
men born in Mexico were higher intakes of several vita-
mins and minerals. Both women and men born in Mexico
had significantly higher intakes of vitamin C, folate, vita-
min B6, and calcium than US-born women and men,
regardless of language spoken. With the exception of US-
born Spanish-speaking women, intakes of fiber, potassium,
and magnesium also were significantly higher among
women and men born in Mexico. Women and men born in
Mexico also had significantly higher vitamin E intakes than
US-born Spanish-speaking women and men and signifi-
cantly higher vitamin A intakes than US-born English-
speaking women and US-born Spanish-speaking men.
Several significant first-order interactions were found (p <
0.05) between the three groups and education or age.
However, they were of low magnitude and did not appear
to be clinically meaningful.
The least-squares means, adjusted for education, age,
and all first-order interaction terms, are presented in table
3. Differences in folate and calcium intake appear particu-
larly clinically significant between Mexican-born and US-
born women and men. With the exception of vitamin A, no
significant differences in nutrient intakes were found
between Spanish-speaking and English-speaking US-born
Mexican Americans. Similar results were found when
nutrient densities, as measured by nutrient intakes per
1,000 calories, were compared among the three groups of
women and men.
Consistent with the results reported above, higher per-
centages of women and men born in Mexico met the US
dietary guidelines for total and saturated fat, fiber, and
potassium than did their US-born counterparts (table 4).
Furthermore, higher percentages achieved 100 percent or
more of the recommended intakes of vitamin C, folate,

vitamin B6, calcium, and magnesium. While approximately
one-fourth to one-third of all Mexican Americans reported
taking a vitamin or mineral supplement in the past month,
fewer women and men born in Mexico reported this behav-
ior than their counterparts did. For all dietary comparisons,
no consistent pattern of differences was found between the
US-born Spanish- and English-speaking groups.
For the migration and acculturation groups, the average
number of times foods were consumed during the 1-month
period preceding the respondent's interview date is summa-
rized in table 5. There were few differences in the patterns
of milk, meat, and egg consumption. Women and men born
in Mexico consumed more fruits and fruit juices, vegetables,
and grains and legumes than did those born in the United
States. Of note are the differences in consumption of salty
snacks (e.g., chips, pretzels), desserts, and added fats (e.g.,
salad dressings, margarine) by migration status and level of
acculturation. In general, English-speaking women and men
born in the United States reported the highest levels,
Spanish-speaking respondents born in the United States
reported intermediate levels, and respondents born in
Mexico reported the lowest levels. It is important to recog-
nize that our food intake data were not tested for statistical
significance because of the large number of comparisons
made. However, the pattern of food intake (e.g., added fats)
was consistent with that of nutrient intake (e.g., percentage
of calories from total fat) observed across the three groups
of Mexican-American women and men.
DISCUSSION
This study compared intakes of nutrients related to CVD
and foods in a US sample of Mexican-American women and
men differentiated by country of birth and primary language
spoken. Overall, women and men born in Mexico had the
healthiest nutrition profiles despite lower levels of education
and more persons living below the poverty level. This finding
suggests that migration status may be an important determinant
of diet. In contrast, nutrition profiles were similar for Mexican-
American women and men born in the United States regardless
of language spoken, suggesting that this measure of accultura-
tion was not an important determinant of diet in this sample.
One possible explanation for the lack of differences in
diet according to primary language spoken may be that all
persons in the United States are similarly exposed to food
advertising and food choices from the time they are young.
Past research provides evidence that food choices made dur-
ing childhood influence food choices made during adult-
hood (36). In contrast, lack of exposure to Americanized
dietary habits during childhood may have contributed to the
healthier diets of Mexican Americans born in Mexico, most
of whom came to the United States as adults.
Comparison to other research
In general, we found that women and men born in Mexico
consumed significantly fewer calories from total and satu-

rated fat and significantly more fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C,
vitamin E, folate, vitamin B6, calcium, potassium, and mag-
nesium, after accounting for education and age, than did
US-born Mexican-American women and men. Our energy
and nutrient results, with the exception of dietary choles-
terol, agree with findings from the few studies that have
evaluated the diets of Hispanics or Mexican Americans by
country of birth, generational status, or primary language
spoken (9­11). In other studies (9, 10), cholesterol intake
was significantly higher in first-generation Mexican-
American women. In our study, only men born in Mexico
reported a significantly higher cholesterol intake compared
with US-born men.
Our results differ from those of the San Antonio Heart
Study and the San Luis Valley Diabetes Study. For example,
in contrast to our study, calcium and potassium intakes were
lowest among the poorest Mexican Americans in the San
Antonio Heart Study (12) and did not differ by educational
level among Hispanics in the San Luis Valley Diabetes
Study (13). These inconsistent findings are possibly due to
the different ways in which Hispanics were compared (by
migration status and primary language spoken in our study,
by neighborhood income in the San Antonio Heart Study,
and by years of education in the San Luis Valley Diabetes
Study). Although Balcazar et al. (37) have shown that lan-
guage spoken and years of education are correlated (r 
0.21), some Hispanics who predominantly speak Spanish
are highly educated while some Hispanics who predomi-
nantly speak English have little education. Thus, studies that
compare Hispanics by using only one characteristic (e.g.,
country of birth), without adjusting for others (e.g., primary
language spoken, years of education), may not differentiate
this population clearly.
As we found for nutrient intakes, a greater proportion of
Mexican-born than US-born Mexican-American men and
women met the dietary guidelines for total fat, saturated fat,
fiber, and potassium and averaged more than 100 percent of
the recommended intakes of vitamin C, folate, vitamin B6,
calcium, and magnesium. While approximately half of all
women achieved the recommended intakes of vitamins C
and B6, less than one-third, including those born in Mexico,
did so for vitamin A, vitamin E, folate, calcium, and mag-
nesium on a given survey day. These percentages must be
interpreted with caution, however, because single 24-hour
recalls do not represent a person's usual intake. With multi-
ple days of dietary data, the distribution of usual nutrient
intake would narrow, and more people would probably
achieve the recommended intakes (38). Nonetheless, other
studies (39, 40) also have reported low percentages of
Mexican-American women meeting the recommended
intakes of folate and calcium. In light of the recent increase
in the recommended amounts of these nutrients and vitamin
E (34, 35), nutrition education emphasizing these nutrients
may be especially important for all Mexican-American
women, regardless of their country of birth or acculturation
level.
An important finding was the higher percentages of US-
born women and men who reported taking a vitamin or min-

Differences in Dietary Intakes in a US Sample of Mexican Americans 555

eral supplement at least once in the previous month.
Interestingly, similar numbers of US-born Mexican-
American Spanish- or English-speaking women reported
dietary supplement use. Although nutrient intakes from food
sources may decline with increasing acculturation, absolute
intakes of vitamins and minerals may improve with
increased supplement use.
In our study, women and men born in Mexico, compared
with those born in the United States, consumed more fruits,
vegetables, and grains and legumes and had the highest
intakes of traditional Mexican foods such as cornbread, tor-
tillas, beans, and rice. Our findings agree in part with those of
other studies (9, 11, 37, 41) that also reported that more serv-
ings of traditional foods were eaten by less-acculturated com-
pared with more-acculturated Hispanics. Otero-Sabogal et al.
(41) also found a higher fruit intake among less-acculturated
Hispanics. Our finding of higher vegetable intakes among
women and men born in Mexico was inconsistent with other
studies that have shown vegetable intakes to be lower among
less-acculturated Mexican Americans (9, 37, 41). However,
this difference may be explained by how vegetables were
defined. For example, some studies excluded potatoes and
corn; the FFQ we used included these foods as vegetables.
Also, our FFQ had 12 questions about vegetables, while other
questionnaires included as few as one question. Research has
shown that the frequency of foods reported increases with the
number of items asked on the FFQ (38).
We also showed lower intakes of desserts and added fats
among adults born in Mexico compared with US-born
Mexican Americans, a finding that agrees with Schaffer et
al. (9). However, other studies have reported higher rates of
fat avoidance by Latinos as acculturation increases (42, 43).
These discrepant findings are likely due to differences in the
six-item scale used to determine fat avoidance compared
with the NHANES III FFQ that asked about three types of
added fats.
Overall, several factors may account for any discrepan-
cies between our study and other studies of the dietary
intakes of Mexican Americans, including temporal trends in
food intakes, different methods of collecting dietary infor-
mation, changes in nutrient and food databases, and samples
from different regions of the country (38). Data from all
studies were collected in the 1980s, and our study continued
through 1994. Thus, the time frames for all studies were
similar. However, the National Cholesterol Education
Program was introduced in the late 1980s, and the mass
media encouraged the general population to reduce their
dietary fat and cholesterol intakes (44). Many lower-fat
foods also were introduced in the marketplace. Nonetheless,
our results regarding dietary fat are consistent with those
reported prior to introduction of the National Cholesterol
Education Program. Most studies of Mexican Americans
used similar methods to collect dietary data (i.e., 24-hour
recalls to determine nutrient intakes and FFQs to determine
food intakes), but the length of the FFQs (e.g., 22 items in
the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey vs.
62 items in NHANES III), the content of certain items on
the FFQs (e.g., added fats), and the time frame (e.g., past
month vs. past year) varied. Another likely explanation for
any discrepancies is use of different nutrient and food data-
bases to determine nutrient intakes. For example, prior to
NHANES III, the US Department of Agriculture databases
were more likely to include Americanized, commercially
prepared Mexican foods rather than the recipes of foods pre-
pared in Mexican-American homes (45). Different data-
bases also may partially explain conflicting results between
regions of the country, despite control for SES (12, 13).
Moreover, Mexican Americans living in different regions of
the United States may have access to different foods, espe-
cially if the availability of foods changes with the seasons.
Limitations and strengths of our study
One limitation of our study is the cross-sectional design
of NHANES III, which prevented us from drawing causal
inferences. Dietary assessment tools also have inherent lim-
itations (38). For example, a single 24-hour dietary recall is
not representative of individual nutrient intakes because of
day-to-day variation in food consumption, and the FFQ used
in NHANES III is qualitative (i.e., it did not include portion
sizes, which are required to quantify the number of servings
of foods eaten). However, a single 24-hour recall is valid for
measuring nutrient intakes of groups, and the FFQ may be
useful for ranking persons in terms of the frequency of foods
or food groups reported (38). Moreover, inclusion of two
dietary instruments enables a general comparison of results
from each tool (e.g., intake of total fat from the 24-hour
dietary recall and added fats from the FFQ). As mentioned
previously, another limitation regarding dietary data is the
accuracy of the nutrient and food databases used. However,
substantial care was taken to include a wide variety of tradi-
tional Mexican foods and to ensure the accuracy of the
nutrient contents of these foods in the NHANES III database
(Catherine M. Loria, National Center for Health Statistics,
personal communication, 1998).
A further limitation of NHANES III is the unavailability
of in-depth data on some important variables. For example,
our measure of acculturation was based on primary lan-
guage spoken at home, which is a simple indicator of a very
complex adaptation process involving attitudes, cognitive
factors, and personality in addition to language (46). This
definition may explain the inconsistent pattern of differ-
ences we found between Spanish-speaking and English-
speaking US-born Mexican Americans. However, language
use is a central part of the acculturation process and has been
used previously as a proxy for acculturation (23).
It is also possible that our results showing healthier nutri-
tion profiles for persons born in Mexico may be explained
by the "healthy migrant" effect, whereby persons who
immigrate to the United States consume more nutritious
diets than do persons who do not immigrate (47). Therefore,
our dietary intakes may not be representative of all women
and men born in Mexico.
These limitations are balanced by the strengths of
NHANES III, which is one of the most extensive US sur-
veys in existence and includes multiple dietary measures.
NHANES III also oversampled Mexican-American women
and men, thus providing sufficient numbers of participants
556 Dixon et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 6, 2000
in the three acculturation groups and sufficient numbers of
women and men from both the lower and upper SES strata.
Moreover, our analyses adjusted for education in addition to
migration and acculturation status, strengthening our obser-
vations of differences in dietary intakes among Mexican
Americans living in the United States.
Public health implications
The Hispanic population is anticipated to increase from
31.4 million in 2000 (11.4 percent of the US population) to
96.5 million in 2050 (24.5 percent of the US population)
(48). Mexican Americans are projected to constitute the
largest increase of all Hispanic groups. As future genera-
tions of Mexican Americans make the transition further
away from their native culture, healthful diets should be
encouraged to prevent an increased risk of heart disease and
premature mortality.
Our findings of more healthful nutrition profiles among
persons born in Mexico highlight the need to encourage all
Mexican Americans to eat more foods such as whole grains,
beans, and cereals as well as fruits, vegetables, and dairy
foods that are low in fat and high in fiber, vitamins, and min-
erals. Nutrition education is needed for second-generation
MexicanAmericans as they become further removed from the
heart-healthy traditions of their native country and enter a
social milieu in which unhealthy foods are ubiquitous.
