Abstract
Objectives: We aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of ischemic colitis (IC) and to
investigate the occurrence of seasonal variation.
Methods: From January 2008 to December 2014, 368 had IC as the reason for their admission. A
total of 364 patients were enrolled in this study. We investigated patient characteristics and
seasonal variations in incidence.
Results: The mean age (Æstandard deviation) of patients with IC at diagnosis was 66.8
(Æ16.9) years. Most patients had abdominal pain (341 cases), hematochezia (337 cases), and
diarrhea (199 cases) as their chief complaints. The clinical courses of the disease were classified as
transient (294 cases), stricture (17 cases), gangrenous (2 cases), and indeterminate types (51
cases). Although IC tended to occur less frequently in winter, the seasonal difference was not
significant.
Conclusion: There is currently no evidence for seasonal variation in hospital admissions for
IC.

Introduction
Ischemic colitis (IC) is the most common
form of ischemic injury of the gastrointes-
tinal tract,1 with abdominal pain, hemato-
chezia, and diarrhea being among the most
frequent presenting features.2,3 Marston
classified the disease clinically into transient,
stricture, and gangrenous types.4 Numerous
risk factors have been reported for IC,
including cerebrovascular disease, hyperten-
sion, diabetes mellitus, past history of
abdominal surgery, irritable bowel syn-
drome (IBS), and constipation.5 IC there-
fore usually occurs in elderly individuals
with multiple comorbidities, but it may also
occur in young or middle-aged individuals.
Based on our experience in routine clinical
practice, more IC patients seemed to be
admitted in the spring compared with in the
winter. Seasonal variation in disease incidence
is a well-known phenomenon, and we there-
fore aimed to identify any seasonal variation
in the occurrence of IC. For example, acute
myocardial infarction and heart failure occur
most frequently in the winter,6­9 possibly
associated with low-temperature-induced
stimulation of sympathetic nerves and
reduced insensible perspiration.10,11
Seasonal variation in some gastrointes-
tinal diseases has also been reported,12 such
as peptic ulcer diseases, which are more
common in colder seasons.13 Cold stress
stimulates sympathetic nerve activity and
increases catecholamine secretion from the
adrenal medulla, causing blood vessel con-
traction. Contraction of the celiac artery and
the resulting decreased blood supply to the
gastroduodenal mucosa are expected to
increase the risk of developing gastroduode-
nal ulcers. Seasonal variation, especially
during the winter, may also occur in other
gastrointestinal diseases with a pathogenetic
relationship to decreased blood supply. This
suggests that there may be seasonal vari-
ation in the occurrence of IC, though there is
currently no evidence to support this
hypothesis.
We aimed to identify the clinical charac-
teristics of IC and to investigate the presence
of seasonal variation in the occurrence
of IC.
Methods
Data sources and definitions
This study involved a retrospective ana-
lysis of the medical charts of patients who
were admitted to the gastroenterology
wards of Shimane Prefectural Central
Hospital from January 2008 to December
2014. Shimane Prefectural Central
Hospital has the largest emergency depart-
ment in Izumo city, and approximately
half of all patients requiring emergency
care in the Izumo area are admitted to
this hospital. Most patients with IC are
admitted for treatment in Shimane
Prefectural Central Hospital. The diagno-
sis of IC was confirmed based on typical
medical history supported by colono-
scopic, histopathological, and radiologic
findings. An absence of antibiotic admin-
istration prior to the clinical diagnosis and
negative stool cultures were mandatory for
a diagnosis of IC.5,14
Meteorological characteristics and data
The city of Izumo has a temperate, humid
climate (Ko
¨ ppen­Geiger Climate
Classification; Cfa), with a wide seasonal
temperature range. It has a high rainfall
under the influence of monsoons in June and
July, and a relatively cold, dry climate in the
winter. Weather parameters (monthly mean
temperature, diurnal temperature difference,
mean humidity, mean atmospheric pressure,
daylight hours, and precipitation) were
obtained from the Japan Meteorological
Agency (http://www.data.jma.go.jp/risk/
obsdl/). Seasons were defined as follows:
winter (December­February); spring
(March­May); summer (June­August); and
fall (September­November).

Study ethics
This study protocol (R14-086) was reviewed
and approved by the Shimane Prefectural
Central Hospital Ethics Committee, and all
patients provided written informed consent.
Statistical analysis
We assessed differences between propor-
tions using 2 or Fisher's exact tests and
differences between means using Mann­
Whitney U tests. Comparisons of disease
occurrences among different months and
seasons were tested by single-factor analysis
of variance (ANOVA). We investigated
characteristics according to age group by
cluster analysis (Ward method). All analyses
were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics
21. All values of P < 0.05 were considered
significant.
Results
Patient characteristics
A total of 12,804 patients were admitted to
Shimane Prefectural Central Hospital during
the study period, of whom 368 had IC.
Among these 368 patients, four who had IC
as a result of laxative use for colonoscopic
preparation were excluded from this study,
and 364 patients (89 male and 275 female)
were finally enrolled for evaluation of sea-
sonal IC onset (Figure 1). The mean (Æstand-
ard deviation [SD]) age at diagnosis was 66.8
(Æ16.9) years (interquartile range: 55­80).
Women were approximately three times
more likely than men to develop IC.
However, IC could occur at any age, and its
incidence increased with age in both sexes,
with a small additional peak in women in
their 30s. Abdominal pain (341 cases,
93.7%), hematochezia (337 cases, 92.6%),
and diarrhea (199 cases, 54.7%) were the
major symptoms at diagnosis. IC was classi-
fied as transient type (294 cases), stricture type
(17 cases), or gangrenous type (2 cases), while
51 cases could not be classified. There were no
deaths, including deaths from comorbidities,
during the study-observation period. The
distribution of IC in terms of location was
the cecum (0 cases), ascending colon (13
cases), hepatic flexure (11 cases), transverse

colon (79 cases), splenic flexure (109 cases),
descending colon (303 cases), sigmoid colon
(300 cases), and rectum (11 cases). These
results indicated that IC frequently occurred
in the descending colon and sigmoid colon,
but rarely in the right-sided colon.
Monthly variation
There was no significant variation in the
number of patients hospitalized for treatment
of IC throughout the year, though small
peaks were detected in March, June, and
September to October (P ¼ 0.642; Figure 2).
The number of patients with IC tended to be
lower in November and December, though
the difference was not significant.
Seasonal variation
The highest number of IC admissions
occurred during the spring (n ¼ 96, 26.4%)
followed by the summer (n ¼ 93, 25.5%),
and autumn (n ¼ 91, 25.0%), with the lowest
number during winter (n ¼ 84, 23.1%)
(Figure 3). There was no significant differ-
ence in frequency of admissions between
seasons, but there was a non-significant
increasing trend from winter to spring
(P ¼ 0.888). There was also no significant
difference in the seasonal occurrence of IC
(P ¼ 0.490) in male or female patients ana-
lyzed separately. The occurrence of IC in
elderly male and female patients (!50 years,
n ¼ 230) decreased in winter and increased in
spring, while the occurrence in young female
patients (<50 years, n ¼ 44) showed a dif-
ferent trend (data not shown). Young
females more frequently had diarrhea
(P ¼ 0.028), while risk factors including dia-
betes mellitus (P ¼ 0.037), hypertension
(P < 0.001), hyperlipidemia (P ¼ 0.005),
and surgical history (P ¼ 0.011) were less
common. Young female patients thus

ground compared with other groups.
Variations in onset day of the week and
time of day
We also investigated the day of the week
when IC occurred (Figure 4). There was no
significant difference in the frequency of
admissions for IC in relation to day of the
week, though the number of admissions
tended to be lower on Wednesdays
(P ¼ 0.090). We also examined the daily
onset time of IC (Figure 5), and found that
most admissions for IC occurred between
6 pm and midnight, though the difference
was not significant (P ¼ 0.106).
Meteorological data
The monthly mean temperature peaked in
July­August, and the diurnal temperature
change was greatest in March­May. The
mean atmospheric pressure was lowest in
June­August and highest in December­
January. The mean humidity was lowest in
March­April and increased rapidly in May.
Monthly daylight hours were longer in the
summer. There were large variations among
years in terms of monthly precipitation, with
no clear seasonal trend.
New-onset and recurrent IC
The study population included 315 new-
onset and 49 recurrent cases. There was no
significant difference in age, sex, form of
disease, comorbidities, or drugs used at the
time of IC occurrence between initial and
recurrent cases (Table 1). Seasonal variations
and biochemical data, such as peripheral
leukocyte count and C-reactive protein, did
not differ significantly between the two
groups. Twenty of the 49 recurrent cases
had developed initial events before the start
of the study. We compared seasonal recur-
rence of IC in the remaining 18 patients (29
events), in whom the initial and recurrent
events both occurred during the study
period. Half of the recurrent cases developed
recurrent IC in the same season as the initial
event (Table 2). Of the 18 patients, seven
(seasonal recurrent group) experienced recur-
rence in the same season as the initial event,
while the other 11 experienced recurrence in a
different season (non-seasonal recurrent
group). There was no significant difference
in age, sex, form of disease, comorbidities, or
drug usage between the two groups (Table 3).

can be explained by the vascular anatomy of
the colon and rectum. The boundary of the
blood supply from the superior mesenteric
artery and the inferior mesenteric artery is
located on the descending and sigmoid
colons, which are thus vulnerable to ische-
mic damage. Accordingly, the descending
and sigmoid colons were the most com-
monly involved segments in the current
study, as also reported in previous
studies.3,15­17
Seasonality is a well-known feature of the
epidemiology of many diseases. Weather
conditions and seasons are associated with
the incidence of cardiovascular diseases,
such as acute myocardial infarction and
acute heart failure,6­9 and seasonal variation
has also been reported in some gastrointes-
tinal diseases. Peptic ulcer diseases fre-
quently occur in colder months,12 while
Crohn's disease peaks in spring and
summer.18­22 Arteriosclerosis is a major

risk factor for IC, as well as for many
cardiovascular diseases, and we therefore
expected to find that IC was most common
in the colder seasons. However, the results
of this study found no evidence for any
significant seasonal variation in the inci-
dence of IC, although there was a tendency
for IC to be less frequent during the winter.
Previous studies have indicated that the
pathogenesis of IC,2,5,18,23,24 can be roughly
divided into vascular and intestinal factors.
Arteriosclerosis, congestive heart disease,
atrial fibrillation, and hypotension are con-
sidered to be vascular factors that cause a
decrease in the blood supply to the colon,
while constipation, diarrhea, and irritable
bowel syndrome are considered to be intes-
tinal factors that cause intestinal hypercon-
traction. Both factors may be affected by
pharmacologic agents and past history of
abdominal surgery, and it is possible that the
existence of multiple complex risk factors
might mask any effects of seasonal environ-
mental changes on IC. Diarrhea and consti-
pation occurring just before the onset of IC
are considered to be important.
Constipation increases colonic intraluminal
pressure and can reduce colonic perfusion.
Although the possible presence of constipa-
tion before the onset of IC could not be
evaluated in the current study, laxative use
was found in 43 patients (11.8%); however,
patients may have constipation without
taking a laxative. Longstreth and Yao3
reported that constipation preceded the
symptoms of IC in only 7% of episodes,
but another prospective study15 reported the
presence of constipation during the 30 days
before the event in 25% of patients with IC.
This study demonstrated an obvious
female predominance in IC occurrence, as
previously reported.3,5,15,16,18,25­27 Although
oral contraceptives may cause hypercoagul-
ability and ischemia,28,29 these are rarely
used in Japan and were not used in this study
population. In addition, this would not
explain the female predominance among
elderly women who do not use oral contra-
ceptives. However, constipation and laxa-
tive use are more common in women than in

men, among both young and elderly indi-
viduals,30­33 and this may contribute to the
female predominance of IC.
Chang et al.23 reported that the odds of
developing IC were six times greater in
patients with IBS than in those without
IBS, while the risk was only about two-fold
among elderly patients with IBS. This sug-
gests that IBS was more strongly associated
with IC risk among young patients.
The present analysis of patients with
recurrent IC suggested a possible role of
seasonal environmental changes. We com-
pared the seasonality of each event in 18
patients hospitalized for treatment of IC
multiple times, and found that IC often
recurred in the same season. This suggested
that seasonal factors may play a role in in
individuals with certain vascular and intes-
tinal factors. Patients with a history of IC
may thus have a higher chance of developing
recurrent IC in the same season in the future,
though we were unable to identify possible
predictive factors for future recurrence in
the same season.
There were no deaths, including deaths
from comorbidities, during the observation
period in this study. Cosme et al.34 reported
mortalities due to IC in Spain of 5.9%
at first admission and 7.4% 5 years later,

and overall mortalities, including deaths
from comorbidities, of 8.8% and 31.1%,
respectively. These rates were high com-
pared with those observed in the current
study. In contrast, Nagata et al.35 reported
that only one of 57 patients (1.8%) with IC
died from a comorbidity during a mean
follow-up period of 29 months in a study in
Japan, with cumulative 12- and 60-month
mortalities, including deaths from comor-
bidities, of 0% and 6.7%, respectively. The
apparent differences in mortalities between
Japan and Western countries are interesting.
Some authors16,26 reported that IC has a
worse prognosis when isolated in the right
side of the colon, and about 25% of patients
in the United States were classified as having
right-colon ischemia. This was higher than
in the current study, and in sharp contrast
with the previous Japanese reports.
Differences in lifestyle and genetic factors
may influence the prognosis of patients with
IC, and further studies are needed to inves-
tigate the predictive factors for IC.
This study had several strengths, includ-
ing being the first report of seasonal vari-
ation in IC onset. Furthermore, although no
clear seasonality was observed, we deter-
mined that IC was more likely to recur
during the same season as the initial event.
This study also had some limitations. First,
it was a single-center, retrospective study.
Second, the overall temperature of a speci-
fied geographic area may not accurately
represent the actual temperature that an
individual is exposed to, which is also
influenced by personal behavior. Third,
daily variations in weather conditions were
not evaluated.
Conclusions
This study found no evidence for seasonal
variations in hospital admissions due to IC,
though IC may recur more frequently in the
same season as the initial event.
