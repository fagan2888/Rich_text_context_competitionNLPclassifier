ONE OF THE MOST IMPOR-
tanthealthpolicyissuesthat
we face now in this cen-
tury is how to provide sup-
porttoelderlypeoplewithdisabilitiesliv-
ing in the community. Because of
projected demographic shifts in the US
population over the next 50 years, fami-
lies, health care practitioners, and poli-
cymakers will be confronted with a
markedincreaseinthenumberofelderly
people living in the community who
must cope daily with disabilities associ-
atedwithagingandchronicdisease.1 Two
additional social and organizational
trends will further increase the need for
homecaresupportforelderlypeoplewith
disabilities.First,thereisaprojectedtrend
toward reduced nursing home use that
willincreasethenumberofmoreseverely
disabled people living in the commu-
nity. Second, changes in the pattern of
living arrangements will increase the
numberofelderlypeoplelivingaloneand
thus reduce the availability of informal
care.2 These trends portend an increas-
ingnumberofdisabledelderlypeopleliv-
ing in the community vulnerable to

health care organizations are develop-

The concern about the adequacy and
quality of support in the community for
disabledelderlypeopleisparticularlysa-
lient to women for several reasons. First,
women make up a disproportionate
number of disabled elderly people in the
community because they tend to live
longer than men. Second, disabled
women living in the community may be
particularlyvulnerabletounmetneedbe-
cause many of them live alone with lim-
ited resources. Third, even disabled
women in married households may be
vulnerable to unmet need because they
may be more likely than men to be in a
caregiver role themselves.3,4
Unfortunately, we know very little
about gender differences in the receipt

Context Projected demographic shifts in the US population over the next 50 years
will cause families, health care practitioners, and policymakers to confront a marked
increase in the number of people with disabilities living in the community. Concerns
about the adequacy of community support are particularly salient to women, who make
up a disproportionate number of disabled elderly people and who may be particularly
vulnerable because they are more likely to live alone with limited financial resources.
Objective To address gender differences in receipt of informal and formal home care.
Design, Setting, and Participants Nationally representative survey conducted in
1993 among 7443 noninstitutionalized people (4538 women and 2905 men) aged
70 years or older.
Main Outcome Measure Number of hours per week of informal (generally unpaid)
and formal (generally paid) home care received by survey participants who reported any
activity of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) impairment
(n=3109) compared by gender and living arrangement and controlling for other factors.
Results Compared with disabled men, disabled women were much more likely to
be living alone (45.4% vs 16.8%, P.001) and much less likely to be living with a
spouse (27.8% vs 73.6%, P.001). Overall, women received fewer hours of infor-
mal care per week than men (15.7 hours; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-16.9 vs
21.2 hours; 95% CI, 19.7-22.8). Married disabled women received many fewer hours
per week of informal home care than married disabled men (14.8 hours; 95% CI, 13.7-
15.8 vs 26.2 hours; 95% CI, 24.6-27.9). Children (80% women) were the domi-
nant caregivers for disabled women while wives were the dominant caregivers of dis-
abled men. Gender differences in formal home care were small (2.8 hours for women;
95% CI, 2.5-3.1 vs 2.1 hours for men; 95% CI, 1.7-2.4).
Conclusion Large gender disparities appear to exist in the receipt of informal home
care for disabled elderly people in the United States, even within married households.
Programs providing home care support for disabled elderly people need to consider
these large gender disparities and the burden they impose on families when develop-
ing intervention strategies in the community.

mal (generally paid) home care for dis-
abledelderlypeopleintheUnitedStates.
Fewstudieshaveexaminedpatternsand
determinants of informal and formal
home care by gender and the results of
thesestudieshaveconflicted.Somestud-
ies have suggested that women receive
somewhat more care than their male
counterparts,5-7 but the generalizability
of these studies is limited by either small
nonpopulation-basedsamplesorunique
settings. By contrast, results from one
study using a national population-
based community sample in 1989 sug-
gested that disabled women may have
received somewhat less informal care
than their male counterparts.8
In contrast to the paucity of articles
on gender differences in receiving care,
there are more articles addressing gen-
der differences in giving care. This lit-
eraturestronglysuggeststhatwomenare
much more likely to be caregivers than
men.3,4 The dominance of women in the
caregiving role has been attributed to
several factors including the fact that
fewer women have been engaged in paid
employment and that women may more
easily assume the role of caregiver to a
disabled spouse or parent because of tra-
ditional social role functioning.9
We used a large national survey rep-
resentativeofnoninstitutionalizedelderly
people living in the United States to
addressgenderdifferencesinthereceipt
of informal and formal home care. The
researchquestionswere:(1)Doesreceipt

(3)Doesformalcaresubstituteforinfor-
mal care, and thus, diminish the gender
disparity in receipt of home care?
METHODS
Data
We used data from the first wave (1993)
of the Asset and Health Dynamics
Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) study,
an ongoing longitudinal survey of a na-
tionally representative cohort of US el-
derly people born in 1923 or earlier
(N=7443). Funded by the National In-
stitute on Aging, the study was de-
signed to examine health transitions in
old age and their effect on individuals,
families, and society.10 Importantly,
both spouses within married house-
holds received a full interview. In ad-
dition to measures of the health and
functional status of the elderly survey
respondents, data on the number of
hours of care provided by both paid and
unpaid caregivers in the home were col-
lected. Seventy-two percent of those
aged 70 to 79 years were interviewed
by telephone, whereas 70% of those
aged 80 years or older were inter-
viewedinperson(baselineresponserate
was 80%). Approximately 19% of re-
spondents in our study sample re-
quired a proxy (most often a family
member) to help complete the survey.
Response rate did not differ signifi-
cantly by mode of questioning and nei-
ther mode of questioning nor proxy sta-
tus affected our results in this study.
Study Sample
Our study sample included 3109 re-
spondents who: (1) were aged 70 years
or older; (2) lived in the community;
and (3) were disabled, defined as re-
porting during the prior month that
they had difficulty or were receiving
help with 1 or more activity of daily liv-
ing (ADL), ie, eating, transferring, toi-
leting, dressing, bathing, walking across
a room, or instrumental activity of daily
living (IADL), ie, preparing meals, gro-
cery shopping, making telephone calls,
taking medications, managing money.
Variables
The principal dependent variables were
the number of weekly hours of infor-
mal and formal home care. Respon-
dents were classified as having re-
ceived informal home care if they
received in-home assistance with any
ADL or IADL in the prior month from
a relative (paid or not), or unpaid non-
relative with no organizational affilia-
tion.11 Formal home care was defined as
help with any ADL or IADL in the prior
month from a paid nonrelative or from
someone affiliated with an organiza-
tion, whether paid or not.11 Respon-
dents who did not normally perform an
IADL, such as shopping, were not clas-
sifiedashavinganIADLimpairmentnor
as having received help for that IADL.
The number of weekly hours of infor-
mal and formal home care were calcu-
lated using the average number of days
per week (in the prior month), and the
average number of hours per day that
respondents reported receiving help
from caregivers.12
Independent variables of greatest in-
terest were gender, living arrangement
(unmarried and living alone, unmar-
ried and living with others, and cur-
rently married) and level of disability (2
variables indicating the number of cur-
rent ADL impairments and the number
ofcurrentIADLimpairments).13-15 About
three quarters of unmarried elderly
people living with others were residing
with either children or grandchildren.
We also included the most common
medical comorbidities and an indica-
tor of the presence of dementia (de-
rived from an administered test of cog-
nition)16 because these clinical factors
may be associated with need for home
caresupport.Wecontrolledforotherco-
variates previously shown to be associ-
ated with home care.17-19 These in-
cluded predisposing and enabling
factors:age(continuous),ethnicity,edu-
cation, and net worth (TABLE 1).
Analytic Approach
Because a substantial proportion of
respondents used no informal or formal
home care in the month prior to the
administrationofthesurveyandbecause
thedistributionofhoursamonguserswas
highlyskewed,weexaminedcaregiving
usinga2-partmodel.17,20 Inthefirstpart,
logistic regression was used to estimate
the independent association of gender
with any use of informal home care in
thepriormonthcontrollingforotherfac-
tors. In the second part, ordinary least
squares regression was used to estimate
the association of gender with the natu-
rallogarithmofinformalhomecarehours
per week for individuals who used any
services. The results from both models
were combined to calculate adjusted
mean weekly hours of informal home
care for different subgroups of respon-

dents. We then repeated these analyses
andcalculationswithformalcareuseand
total care use (formal and informal care
combined) as the dependent variable.
All analyses were weighted for dif-
ferential probability of selection and ad-
justed for the complex sampling de-
sign of the AHEAD survey.10,21 We
tested for significant interactions be-
tween all covariates and regression di-
agnostics were performed to check for
model assumptions. All analyses were
performed using STATA statistical soft-
ware, Release 6.0 (College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Table1showscharacteristicsofthestudy
population for all variables. About two
thirds of the study sample were women.
Compared with men, women reported
receiving fewer weekly hours of infor-
mal care but reported receiving a greater
number of hours of formal care. Women
were olderand reported lowernet worth
than men. Women were much more
likely to be living alone and much less
likely to be living with a spouse. Women
reported more ADL impairments and
more chronic medical conditions.
Receipt of Informal Care
FIGURE 1 shows the mean weekly hours
of informal care by gender and living ar-
rangementafteradjustingforallotherco-
variates. Overall, women received fewer
hours of informal care (15.7 hours; 95%
CI,14.5-16.9)comparedwithmen(21.2
hours; 95% CI, 19.7-22.8). Two factors
related to living arrangement appeared
to explain the overall gender disparity in
theuseofinformalcare.First,manymore
disabled women lived alone than men
(45.4% vs 16.8%, respectively; Table 1)
and disabled elderly people living alone
received many fewer hours of informal
care than those who were married or liv-
ing with others. Second disabled mar-
ried women received many fewer hours
of informal care (14.8 hours; 95% CI,
13.7-15.8) than disabled married men
(26.2 hours; 95% CI, 24.6-27.9). Dis-
abled married women received about
80% more hours of informal care than
disabledwomenlivingalone(14.8vs8.2
hours, respectively), whereas disabled
married men received 230% more hours
than disabled men living alone (26.2 vs
7.9 hours, respectively).
TABLE 2 shows that these gender dif-
ferences were observed for both the per-
centage of people who received any in-
formal care and the intensity of care
(number of weekly hours) among us-
ers after controlling for all other fac-
tors. Among all disabled elderly people,
55.1% of women vs 60.8% of men re-
ceived any informal care (P.001) and
women received 28.3 hours of care per
user vs 35.6 hours received by men
(P.001). Among the married dis-
abled population, 53.8% of women vs
64.6% of men received any informal
care (P.001), and women received
26.8 hours of care per user vs 39.9
hours received by men (P.001). In-

teractions between gender and living ar-
rangement were significant for both the
probability of any informal care use and
the mean number of hours per user.
TABLE 3 shows the distribution of in-
formal care (percentage using any care
and mean hours among users) by type
of helper, disability level and gender for
elderly people who were married and
disabled. Among those with 1 or 2 ADL
or IADL impairments 27.2% of women
vs 48.6% of men (P.001) received any
informal care and women received 10.0
weekly hours vs 19.6 hours received by
men (P.001). This gender disparity
resulted from disabled women receiv-
ing much less spousal care than their
male counterparts. For example, 17.4%
of women vs 40.3% of men received any
informal care from a spouse alone
(P.001) and female receivers of spou-
sal care on average received 9.8 weekly
hours vs 18.9 hours received by men
(P=.003). The gender disparity in in-
formal care diminished as the level of
disability increased, primarily be-
cause children provided increasing
number of hours of care to their dis-
abled mothers. For example, among
those with 3 to 5 ADL or IADL impair-
ments, 54.6% of women vs 65.1% of
men received any informal care from
a spouse alone (P=.04). However,
19.6% of women vs 8.7% of men re-
ceived any informal care from chil-
dren alone (P=.005). These gender dif-
ferences in the involvement of children
as caregivers were even more marked
for elderly people with 6 to 11 impair-
ments.
Indeed, our results as a whole show
that children played a dominant role in
the care of disabled women whereas
wives played the dominant role in the
care of disabled men. Among all dis-
abled women, 44.6% reported receiv-
ing informal care from 1 or more chil-
dren vs 22.8% of disabled men
(P.001) and more than 80% of these
children were daughters, daughters-in-
law, or granddaughters. By contrast,
only 11.1% of disabled women re-
ported any informal care from a spouse
compared with 43.8% of disabled men
(P.001). Children played an impor-
tant caregiving role even among mar-
ried disabled women since 23.0% re-
ported receiving informal care from 1
or more children vs 13.2% of married
disabled men (P.001). By contrast,
38.0 % of married disabled women re-
ported receiving any informal care from
their spouse compared with 58.0% of
married disabled men (P.001).
The gender disparity in the receipt of
informal home care for married dis-
abled elderly people was not limited to
IADL impairments such as shopping or
preparing meals but rather, it was ob-
served consistently across levels of both
ADL and IADL impairments. For in-
stance, 49.8% of men with 1 ADL im-
pairment and 69.6% with 2 ADL im-
pairments received any informal ADL
support vs 35.1% of women with 1 ADL
impairment and 54.3% with 2 ADL im-
pairments (P.001).
Two factors may explain why hus-
bands of disabled women play a much
lesser role in caregiving than wives of
disabled men. First, husbands of dis-
abled women may be less able to pro-
vide care because they may be older and
more disabled than wives of disabled
men. Indeed, on average, disabled
women lived with husbands who were
1 year older; while disabled men lived
with wives who were on average 4.6
years younger. However, the disabil-
ity level of husbands of disabled women
was similar to that of wives of disabled
men; 42.4% of the husbands of dis-
abled women reported 1 or more im-
pairments (mean [SD] number of im-
pairments, 3.0 [2.6]) compared with
37.8% of the wives of disabled men (3.1
[2.7]). To examine whether spousal age
or spousal disability level influenced the
gender disparity in home care use
among married disabled respondents,
we performed secondary analyses re-
gressing spousal home care support on
respondent gender, age, and disability
level with and without the addition of
spousal age and spousal disability level.
These analyses showed that spousal dis-
ability, not spousal age, was inversely
associated with spousal support but that
the gender disparity in weekly hours of
spousal home care support was un-
changed after controlling for these
spousal factors.
Another explanation for the gender
difference in informal care in married
households is that husbands may be less

prepared to fulfill the social role func-
tion of caregiving even without the pres-
ence of disability.3,4 Indeed, our re-
sults suggest that many married women
with disability remained in a domi-
nant caregiving role even if they them-
selves reported severe disability: 20%
of married disabled women who re-
ported 2 or more ADL impairments
were providing informal home care to
their husbands whereas only 8% of
similarly disabled married men were
providing informal care to their wives.
Formal Home Care
FIGURE 2 shows adjusted weekly hours
of formal care by gender and living ar-
rangement. Formal care did not sub-
stantially diminish the large gender dis-
parity in use of informal care because
formal care use was much lower com-
paredwithinformalcareuse,andtheab-
solute difference in formal care use
across gender was very small. The prob-
ability of receiving any formal care was
about one fifth that of informal care.
About 10% of disabled elderly people re-
ceived some formal care (13.2% women
vs 11.0% men, P=.13), but more than
half received some informal care. Ad-
justed weekly hours of formal care were
2.8 hours (95% CI, 2.5-3.1) for women
and2.1hoursformen(95%CI,1.7-2.4).
Thegenderdifferenceinadjustedweekly

nificant for all respondents (for women

COMMENT
Our results show that there was a large
gender disparity in the receipt of infor-
mal home care for elderly people with
disability in the United States. Control-
ling for disability and other factors, dis-
abled women received about one third
fewerhoursofcarethantheirmalecoun-
terparts. This was mainly due to 2 fac-
tors.First,nearlyhalfofdisabledwomen
lived alone vs 17% of men, whereas
nearly three quarters of disabled men
livedwithaspouse.Second,marrieddis-
abledwomenreceivedmanyfewerhours
of care compared with their married
male counterparts.
Many disabled women lived alone
with very limited financial resources
available to obtain outside help. Our re-
sults show that in 1993 more than 25%
of disabled women lived alone and had
a net worth of less than $30000 (vs
about 6% of disabled men). This rep-
resented about 1.3 million women in
the United States. A surprising finding
in our study was that married women
with disability received many fewer
hours of care than their male counter-
parts. Disabled married women re-
ceived about 80% more informal home
care hours than disabled women liv-
ing alone while disabled married men
received about 230% more care than
disabled men living alone. Our results
suggest that this gender disparity was
likely related to sociocultural factors re-
garding the caregiving role rather than
physical limitations of the husbands of
disabled women because husbands and
wives of disabled married respon-
dents reported similar levels of impair-
ment. Furthermore, controlling for
spousal age and spousal impairment did
not change the gender disparity in re-
ceipt of home care. The dominance of
women as caregivers for disabled el-
derly people may be because fewer
women are engaged in paid employ-
ment and because women may more
easily assume the role of caregiver to a
disabled spouse or parent because of
traditional social role functioning.3,4,9

marriedwomenwith2ormoreADLim-
pairments vs 8% of married men were
caregivers to their spouse.
Several aspects of the study merit
comment. First, the gender differences
that we found might have been mainly
related to IADL support for grocery
shopping or preparing meals, which is
traditionally provided by women, and
may have been overreported in the sur-
vey. We do not believe this to be the case
because the gender difference was con-
sistently observed across both ADL and
IADL support categories. Further-
more, question formats in the survey
sought to exclude IADL support unas-
sociated with a health problem. An-
other limitation is that our data are for
only 1 year. Although the AHEAD sur-
vey is longitudinal, the subsequent 2
waves (1995 and 1998) dropped ques-
tionspertainingtohoursofinformalcare
providedbyspouses.Thus,wecouldnot
include these waves in our analyses.
The gender difference in the receipt
of informal care and the role of family
members in the care of disabled elderly
people have enormous implications for
homecareprogrampoliciesintheUnited
States. Biological, social, and organiza-
tional trends in the United States will
result in a marked increase in the num-
ber of elderly people living with disabil-
ity in the community.24 The conse-
quencesofthesetrendsonthequalityof
life of elderly people and their families
differ markedly by gender. Our results
show that women and their extended
familiesaremuchmorevulnerabletothe
consequences of these trends than men.
Many more women than men are dis-
abled, and care may be less available for
disabled women because they are much
more likely to be living alone with very
limited financial resources. Less obvi-
oustopolicymakersandcliniciansisthe

because of limited caregiving from their
husbands and because they themselves
must often remain a central caregiver in
the family. Because disabled elderly
womenrelyheavilyonchildrenforsup-
port,especiallyfemalechildren,thefam-
ilyburdenandstressassociatedwithcar-
ing for a disabled woman should be the
subject of further study. Programs pro-
viding home care support to elderly
people need to consider these large gen-
der disparities and consequences on the
burden on the family when developing
and targeting intervention strategies in
the community.
