Introduction
Reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria by blockade of
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has been
the cornerstone of renoprotective intervention for patients
with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for many years.1
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and
angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) have well docu-
mented effects in delaying the progression of both diabetic
and non-diabetic CKD.2 For this reason, national guide-
lines recommend that pharmacologic therapy for CKD
patients with proteinuria and hypertension should include
an ACEI or ARB.3 Little is known about the adherence to
these guidelines and methods of implementation of such
therapy. The available studies showed that despite these
known benefits, inadequate numbers of persons with clini-
cal indications for RAAS blockade use an ACEI or ARB.4,5
To shed more light on this issue we performed four
independent retrospective surveys to check the use of
RAAS blocking agents in CKD patients under specialist
care during the last 15 years and to find out how these treat-
ments were managed.

Abstract
Background: Reduction of blood pressure and proteinuria by blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
(RAAS) has been the cornerstone of renoprotective intervention for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) for
many years.
Aims: The aims were to check the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and/or angiotensin II
receptor blockers (ARBs) in CKD patients.
Methods: This was a retrospective, cross-sectional study analysing data from medical records of patients who received
specialist care in 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 in the Outpatient Unit.
Results: The numbers of CKD subjects included in the four independent surveys were as follows: 190, 490, 1799, 1696.
The usage of RAAS blocking agents overall increased significantly in subsequent years as follows: 25, 49, 63, 74%. Patients
with proteinuria and cardiovascular complications and/or diabetes were receiving RAAS blocking agents more commonly
than others. The use of ACEI and/ or ARB in stage 4­5 CKD increased in subsequent years. In 2011 dual RAAS blockade
was used in 10% CKD patients overall and 19% patients presented proteinuria.
Conclusion: The use of RAAS blocking agents were increasing in CKD patients under specialist care between 1996­
2011. The quality of the management was gradually improved.

Methods
The study was performed at the Outpatient Unit of the
Department of Nephrology Transplantology and Internal
Medicine, Medical University of Gdansk, Poland. It was a
retrospective, cross-sectional study analysing data from
medical records in four independent surveys. Data were
collected from January 2012­April 2012. The authors ana-
lysed 1952 medical records of all non-dialysed and non-
transplanted adults patients treated in the unit. Four
independent cross-sectional analyses at four different
time-points were performed. The first survey analysed
data from 1996. The second, third and fourth surveys ana-
lysed data of patients who received outpatient care in
2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively. Data from the first visit
in the year was gathered for the analysis. The authors ana-
lysed demographic status and clinical information includ-
ing renal, cardiovascular and diabetic status as well as
current antihypertensive treatment. Data concerning serum
creatinine and potassium concentration referred to a single
assessment, the first in the year. Serum potassium above
5.1 mmol/l was treated as hyperpotassaemia. In particular,
the use of RAAS blocking agents was analysed. Subgroup
analysis was performed to check the usage of ACEIs and
ARBs in combination with the presence of proteinuria,
cardiovascular complications and/or diabetes, CKD stage,
sex and age. Dosing of ACEIs and ARBs was determined
as the % of patients receiving drugs in the following ranges
of their maximal doses: <25%; 25­50%; 51­75%; >75%.
The implementation of a combination RAAS blockade
including simultaneous usage of an ACEI and ARB was
analysed. We checked also the use of diuretics in addition
to RAAS blocking agents as well as the presence of hyper-
kalaemia in subjects treated with ACEI and/or ARB.
Study population
Non-dialysed, non-transplanted adults patients with CKD
diagnosed according to the Kidney Disease Outcomes
Quality Initiative (KDOQI) definition were included in the
study.6
Aims
The aims were to check the use of RAAS blocking agents i.e.
ACEIs and/or ARBs in CKD patients. The secondary goal
was to illustrate the management of RAAS blockade i.e. dos-
ing, combination with other drugs, use of ACEI and ARB in
different stages of CKD, presence of hyperkalaemia.
Definitions
CKD was diagnosed as a glomerular filtration of less than
60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or the presence of kidney damage
for more than three months, according to KDOQI guide-
lines.6 The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was
calculated from serum creatinine using the Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease Study Group (MDRD) formula7.
Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure
(BP)140 mm Hg and/ or diastolic BP90 mm Hg or
undergoing current treatment with antihypertensive drugs.
Statistics
Categoric and continuous variables are expressed as fre-
quencies (%) and mean±standard deviation (SD), respec-
tively. A 2 test was used for categorical variables, while
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for continuous
variables. In secondary analyses patients were stratified
according to age, sex, CKD stage, diagnosis, cardiovascu-
lar complications and/or diabetes presence.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristic
Overall 193, 500, 1952 and 1706 patients were screened
using their medical records from 1996, 2001, 2006 and
2011, respectively. The number of CKD subjects included
in the four independent surveys were as follows 190, 490,
1799 and 1696. The general characteristics of the partici-
pants are summarised in Table 1. An increasing number of
patients were diagnosed as having hypertensive nephropa-
thy (p<0.001) and diabetic nephropathy (p<0.001). The
average eGFR decreased significantly in subsequent years
and was as follows 67, 56, 54 and 51 ml/min (p<0.001).
There was a remarkable change in the average age of CKD
patients which was as follows: 43.8, 47.2, 54.9 and 62.7
(p<0.001). The number of patients who were more than 65
years of age increased significantly from 8.5% in 1996 (up
to 52% in 2011 (p<0.001). The number of patients with
cardiovascular disease increased significantly as well
(p<0.001).
Usage of RAAS blockade
The usage of RAAS blocking agents increased signifi-
cantly in subsequent years (p<0.001) (Figure 1). ACEIs
were used in 25.26%, 46.73%, 50.69% and 46.34% in
1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011, respectively. ARBs were not
used in 1996 and significant increments in their usage
were observed in subsequent years as follows: 1.02%,
4.28% and 17.92%. In the subgroup with proteinuria
more patients received RAAS blocking agents (Figure
2). Overall 78.46% proteinuric subjects were treated
with ACEIs and/or ARBs in 2011 as compared to 72.99%
CKD patients without proteinuria (p<0.05) (Table 2).
Similarly, men as well as patients with cardiovascular
complications and/or diabetes were receiving RAAS
blockade agents more commonly. There were no differ-
ence in the use of RAAS blocking agents according to
age (Table 2).
Tylicki et al. 147
Usage of RAAS in different stages of CKD
Subgroup analysis revealed that usage of RAAS blocking
agents overall increased in all CKD stages. In stages 4­5
of CKD the % of patients receiving an ACEI and/or ARB
increased in subsequent years and was as follows: 16.7%,
36.8%, 64.9% and 66.9% (p<0.001) . Nevertheless, use of
ACEIs and/or ARBs was lower among patients in stage
4­5 CKD compared with patients in stage 1­2 CKD and
stage 3 CKD in 2001, 2006 and 2011 (Table 3).
Dosing of RAAS blocking agents
The tendency to increase doses of ACEIs and ARBs used
by CKD patients was observed in subsequent years. The
percentage of patients receiving ACEIs in the range
76­100% of their maximal doses increased significantly
(p<0.001) and was as follows: 4.2%, 7.4%, 14.7% and
48.2%. In 2011 most patients treated with ACEIs received
these agents in the highest range of doses. Simultaneously,
the % of patients receiving an ACEI below 25% of the
maximal dose decreased in subsequent years (p<0.001)
(Figure 3).
There was also a significant increment in dosing of
ARBs. The percentage of patients receiving ARB in the
range above 75% of their maximal doses increased signifi-
cantly between 2006­2011 from 11.9% to 22.7%
(p<0.001). Nevertheless, most patients treated with ARB
were receiving these drugs in the range below 25% and
25­50% of their maximal doses in 2001 and 2006­2011
respectively (Figure 4).

Dual RAAS blockade
Dual RAAS blockade including ACEI+ARB was not pre-
scribed in 1996. The usage of such a combination increased
significantly in subsequent years and was as follows 0%,
1.02%, 7.73% and 10.02% (p<0.001). The similar increas-
ing tendency was observed among subgroup CKD patients
with proteinuria. In subsequent years 0%, 1.89%, 16.82%
and 17.01% were treated with dual RAAS blockade among
them (p<0.001) (Figures 1 and 2).
RAAS blockade accompanied by diuretics
The use of diuretics among patients receiving ACEIs and/
or ARBs was as follows: 37.5%, 38.07%, 50.09% and
56.94% in 1996, 2001, 2006 and 2011 respectively
(p<0.001).
RAAS blockade and serum potassium level
There were no significant differences in serum potas-
sium concentration between patients treated with
RAAS blockade as monotherapy, patients treated with
dual RAAS blockade (ACEI plus ARB) and subjects
who were not treated with RAAS blocking agents
(Table 4). Although there were numerical differences in
the frequencies of hyperpotassaemia between these
subgroups (the highest during dual RAAS blockade)
generally they did not reach statistical significance
(Table 5).

Subgroup analysis of patients treated with ACEIs and/or
ARBs revealed that the highest frequency of hyperkalae-
mia were observed in patients in CKD 4­5 stages as com-
pared to CKD 1­2 and CKD 3 (2006 and 2011) (Figure 5).
Discussion
The use of RAAS blocking agents increased in the studied
populations in subsequent years. In 2011, 74% of patients
received these drugs, with nearly 79% of patients with pro-
teinuria. ACEI drugs are the most common ones, as
approximately every other patient was treated with ACEI.
In the Polish CKD population not managed by nephrolo-
gists (Epidemiology of Kidney Diseases in Poland - pilot
study (PoINEF) analysis of 2007) approximately 61% of
patients received ACEIs.8 These indicators are high, taking
into account the studies from other centres ­ for instance,

(NHANES) in 2006, which showed that in the American
population of CKD patients who received antihypertensive
treatment, only 37% of patients received an ACEI or
ARB.9 In the Mediterranean countries the proportion of
patients treated with RAAS inhibitors is larger, with values
reaching 39% (Spain, ACEI alone), 62% (France, ACEI or
ARB, 2008) and 53­80% in Italy (2005).10­13 In our centre
the % of patients receiving ACEI has been on a fairly
unchanged level since 2001. This year, however, what we
observed is an increasingly more frequent use of ARBs, a
more recent group of RAAS inhibitors, which were intro-
duced into Polish clinical practice in the late nineties. The
stratified analysis of the use of RAAS blocking agents
controlled by age did not reveal any differences. Patients
with proteinuria, cardiovascular complications and/or dia-
betes and men, however, were more commonly treated
with an ACEI and/or ARB as compared to others.
The matter of the ACEI and ARB administration in
patients with impaired glomerular filtration has caused
numerous controversies.14 To this day, some clinicians
reluctantly administer the RAAS inhibiting agents in
patients with chronic renal failure due to a risk of sudden
renal function deterioration or hyperkalaemia. The post-
hoc, secondary analysis of the REIN trial shed new light
on this intriguing issue. The study clearly established that
the renoprotective effect of ACEI is independent of renal
function and provided a strong background for the recom-
mendation to administer the RAAS-inhibiting agents to all
patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies, regardless
of renal function.15 This seems to be reflected in the results
of our study. The use of ACEIs and ARBs in the most
advanced CKD stages increased in subsequent surveys.
Until now, the optimal nephroprotective dosing of
ACEI and ARB has not been established and, therefore,
the dosages used in the treatment of arterial hypertension
are commonly administered. The results of our previous
studies clearly showed that even very low ACEI or ARB
doses, which have been found not to produce significant
effect on arterial pressure, decrease proteinuria.16 The evi-
dence exists, however, that blockade of the RAAS is a
closely dose-related phenomenon and the enhancement of
the RAAS inhibition by increasing the dosage of ACEI or
ARB allows for a greater decrement of proteinuria and
attenuation of tubular injury.17 Therefore, considering the
prognostic impact of proteinuria reduction on renal out-
come, it has been commonly recommended to uptitrate the
ACEI or ARB for maximal antiproteinuric effect regard-
less of BP. The tendency to increase dosing of ACEIs was
observed in subsequent years of our observation. In 2011
most patients received these agents in the highest range of
their doses. ARBs were used most commonly in the range
25­50% of their maximal doses. The reason for limiting
the dosing of ARBs in our population as compared to the
dosing of ACEIs may derive from economic factors in
Polish conditions in these years.
The combination therapy of ACEI and ARB has been
studied extensively for some years with respect to renal
protection. Several clinical studies have investigated dual
RAAS blockade in nondiabetic, diabetic or mixed renal
patients and documented a greater antiproteinuric effect
of such a combination in comparison with monother-
apy.9,18 Given these results, the dual RAAS blockade was
considered for a time even as a gold standard of treatment
for chronic proteinuric kidney disease.19 In the world lit-
erature there is little data on the frequency of use of such
a therapy. In Italy the use of dual RAAS blockade was in
the range of 2­8% of the CKD population (2005).10,13,20
In 1996 there were no patients treated with ACEI plus
ARB in our population whereas 1% and 8% of patients
received such treatment in 2001 and 2006 respectively.
Decrease of enthusiasm for the combination therapy and
the inhibition of growth trend in use of it in 2011 was
probably associated with the results of the ONTARGET
study, which not only showed no long-term benefits
resulting from such therapy, but drew attention to a num-
ber of its dangers including the risk of life-threatening
hyperkalaemia and acute renal failure.21 To shed some
light on this issue we analysed potassium serum levels in
patients treated with RAAS blocking agents as monother-
apy, those who received dual RAAS blockade of an ACEI
plus ARB and subjects without such treatment. Patients
on the combination therapy ACEI plus ARB had a numer-
ically higher concentration of serum potassium and the
frequency of hyperkalaemia regarded as serum potas-
sium level above 5.1 mmol/l, nevertheless, the differ-
ences did not reach significance level. The results may
suggest that careful management of CKD patients treated
with RAAS inhibitors, even with dual RAAS blockade,
may prevent a dangerous rise of the potassium level.
Subgroup analysis confirmed that special attention
should be paid to patients with advanced CKD which are
at highest risk of hyperkalaemia during such treatment.
Of note, a potential limitation of this analysis is the fact
that data concerning serum potassium concentration
referred only to a single assessment.
The hypotensive and antiproteinuric effect of RAAS
inhibitors is impaired with a high salt intake, thus,
patients treated with an ACEI or ARB are commonly
instructed to follow a low salt diet and their treatment
should be accompanied by diuretics.22 Awareness of this
fact seems to increase slightly in nephrologists as the use
of diuretics among patients receiving ACEI and/ or ARB
was increasing in subsequent years of our observation.
One should take into account the fact, however, that
almost every other patients was unfortunately not treated
with diuretics in 2011.
In summary the use of RAAS blocking agents was
increasing in CKD patients under the care of nephrologists
in Gdansk between 1996­2011. The quality of manage-
ment was gradually improved.
