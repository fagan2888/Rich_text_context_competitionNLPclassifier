Studying homicide in the home
and how guns are kept
Having a gun in the home appears to increase
the risk of homicide victimization1 and
perpetration.2 Some strategies to prevent
gunshot deaths focus on firearm design and
distribution practices. But what about the
approximately 200 000 000 guns that are pri-
vately owned in the United States already?3 Is
the risk of homicide in the home associated
with how guns are kept?
Survey data published by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) portend
an answer. The National Mortality Followback
Survey (NMFS) interviews proxy respondents
and gathers detailed information about US
decedents, including homicide victims.4 The
most recent (1993) NMFS asked if there were
guns in the victim's home and how they were
kept (for example, loaded, disassembled).
Nearly identical questions were asked the fol-
lowing year in the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS), which yielded data about how
living people keep their guns.5
We used the data to assess if the risk of
being killed in one's home (homicide) was
associated with how the firearms were kept.
Question wording prevented full use of the
data. People who reported that multiple guns
were present were asked one set of questions;
the wording makes it unclear how a particular
gun was kept. People reporting a single gun
were asked different questions; these data are
more tractable. Among the latter individuals,
14% of the living subjects and 58% of the
homicide victims kept the gun in a non-
recommended manner (that is, unlocked and
loaded or with ammunition). Unfortunately,
the relative risk for people with multiple guns
in their homes (about 75% of the US
households that contain guns3) cannot be
determined.
Additional data are needed. One source is
the 1998 NHIS, which asked revised firearm
questions. We hope the NMFS is revised and
readministered as well.
Asking people about guns, doing it quickly
and concisely, and eliciting accurate infor-
mation is a challenge. We are encouraged by
the NCHS's commitment to include firearm
questions on their already lengthy surveys.
The firearm section is key, providing infor-
mation by which to address important re-
search questions.

Patterns of violence in Karachi,
Pakistan
I welcome the paper by Chotani et al on
violence in Pakistan and the empirical nature
of the exploration.1 It is also encouraging to
see Injury Prevention raise the issue of violence
in developing countries, as it is a neglected
health problem. However, from the Pakistani
context, there are several contextual and
explanatory points that are needed to clarify
some of the issues raised in the paper and also
to add to them.
1. Macroeconomic changes have affected
Pakistani society for the past two decades
with important impacts on the health and
social sectors.2 One of the impacts is on the
levels of violence and unintentional injuries--
trends that have not been appropriately stud-
ied in the developing world. The impact of
adjustment programs like the Social Action
Program in Pakistan therefore merit discus-
sion in a dialogue exploring the nature and
patterns of violence.
2. I disagree with the claim made in the
paper that there have been no comparisons of
police data with other data sources in
Pakistan. National burden of disease analysis
for Pakistan included all types of injuries and
used such a comparative analysis.3 Moreover,
innovative sources of data have also been
compared to police data on violence in the
literature.4 Indeed more work needs to be
done in this area to enhance the internal con-
sistency of data from Pakistan--a research
agenda for the country.
3. I was surprised to note the lack of atten-
tion to the role of firearms in the discussion
and prevention part of the paper. The influx of
firearms since the eighties, the relationship
with substance abuse, and the drug trade are
important considerations for exploring vio-
lence in Pakistan. There are major economic
relationships between these factors and all of
them facilitate and potentiate the occurrence
and impact of violence in the country, includ-
ing political and ethnic violence. Most impor-
tantly, the control of firearms and their use is
a potential preventive strategy which needs to
be explored in the Pakistani context.
4. Although not the intent of the study, it is
worth reflecting that there are enormous
costs to violence everywhere. In addition to
the direct and indirect medical and treatment
costs to those injured or dead, there are
societal costs in the form of preventive, reha-
bilitative, structural, and quality of life factors.
If such an assessment was to be done in Kara-
chi, I am sure one could attribute a large cost
amount to violence. We must begin to use
economic arguments as well, to enhance the
case for greater attention to violence in the
developing world.
As suggested by the authors, it is time to
analyze the causes and consequences of
violence in Pakistan systematically. The use of
evidence in doing such analysis is critical; the
development of a framework to link the
different causative and impact pathways is
vital; and finally the ability to mobilize
Pakistani society to reject such violence and
develop their own capacity for preventing it, is
probably the most important.

District hospital based injury
data--are they an option in a
developing country?
Lack of epidemiological data on injuries is one
of the main impediments to injury prevention
activities.1 Setting up a costly surveillance
system is not an option in many developing
countries. Utilizing existing sources of data
like the hospital logs has been suggested.2 We
present our findings on the quality of injury
data available in existing logs in a district
hospital in a developing country.
Mangochi District (total population about
660 000) in southern Malawi is served by a
250 bed district hospital. We reviewed the dis-
charge logs from pediatric, male, and female
wards for a period of six months (1 August
1995 to 31 January 1996). A total of 3188
patients were admitted during the study
period (998 children, 2190 adults). There were
386 patients with injuries, 64 (17%) among
children under age 5 years. Children were
more likely to be admitted for injury than
adults (17% v 9.7% p<0.001). Discharge diag-
nosis showed that "fractures, sprains, and
dislocations" accounted for over half (196;
51%) of all injuries. Motor vehicle crashes (62;
16%), burns (41; 11%), assaults (24; 6%), bites
(10; 3%), and poisoning (8; 2%) accounted for
most of the remainder. There were a total of 22
deaths after admission to the hospital (case
fatality rate 6%). Children had higher case
fatality rate compared with adults (7.8 v
5.3%), though the difference failed to reach
statistical significance (odds ratio 1.52, 95%
confidence interval 0.47 to 4.61).
The epidemiological data in the logs were
limited. No information describing the cir-
cumstances, mechanism, nature, severity, or

intentionality of injury was available. Out-
come information was limited to dead versus
alive. Discharge diagnosis varied between type
of injury (for example, fracture) and cause of
injury (for example, motor vehicle crashes,
falls, etc). Routine information from district
hospitals in developing countries, therefore,
may be insufficient to identify risk groups and
inform data driven interventions.

When doing nothing can cause
harm
Newspapers may be a primary source of
information for the general public, but they
do little to educate the public about strategies
to prevent injuries or reduce mortality.1
Research on newspaper clippings on uninten-
tional injury events indicates that out of 577
articles reporting on motor vehicle accidents,
only 3% mention alcohol use by the driver and
9% mention seat belt use.2
To better understand this situation, we sur-
veyed daily newspaper editors to determine
their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about
risk reporting, and to measure the extent to
which they integrated risk reduction and
injury prevention into their articles. We devel-
oped, piloted, and revised a survey instrument
and emailed it to all daily newspaper editors
in Iowa (n=33). One week later, we re-
emailed each of the editors attaching the sur-
vey and restating its purpose. A total of four
surveys and reminders were sent by both post
and email. However, only seven editors (21%)
responded--all indicating a lack of interest in
injury control. As a result, we telephoned the
remaining editors, leaving a minimum of four
messages. We were able to contact only eight
and none of these eight desired to complete
the survey. Not only did the editors lack inter-
est in the survey, some exhibited strongly
negative attitudes to injury control.
This experience suggests several conclu-
sions. First, injury prevention is certainly not
a priority. Second, the editors expressed little
interest in learning about injury control. The
exceptions were those with personal relation-
ships with injury control personnel. Working
with the media is an area that needs to be
improved by injury control professionals.
Third, if injury control is to remain in the
newspapers, there may be a need to focus
more on the use of paid advertisements/
editorials to reach the reader.

BOOK REVIEW
Injury Control: A Guide to
Research and Program
Evaluation.
Edited by FP Rivara, P Cummings, TD
Koepsell, DC Grossman, and RV Maier. (Pp
304; £65 hardback.) Cambridge University
Press, 2001. ISBN 0-521-661528.
Fred Rivara, the principal editor of this book,
ends the introductory chapter by noting that
injury, at the beginning of the 21st century,
continues to cause enormous death and
disability worldwide. Although some progress
in controlling the toll of injury has been made
in the last 50 years, Rivara observes that "fur-
ther reduction in injury will depend on
increasingly more sophisticated research. It is
our hope that this volume will help to stimu-
late such efforts". I certainly agree with his
assessment.
To that end, 30 well known injury research-
ers collaborated on 20 chapters that cover a
wide range of issues related to research and
evaluation in the field of injury. Injury Control
spans issues of measurement of injury events
and consequences, the management of injury
data, various approaches to designing and
carrying out injury related research--from
descriptive and analytical epidemiological
studies to intervention trials, economic analy-
ses, assessments and improvements in clinical
care, and ethical issues. The volume appears to
be pegged to scientists and practitioners in the
"middle", somewhere between novices and
experts. That's fine, since most injury books to
date have been pegged to the most introduc-
tory level.
The chapters are generally short, and the
authors have followed similar formats. The
advantage of this approach is that the chapters
have a similar structure. The disadvantage is
that the chapters,in some cases,may be thin on
detailed information or lack pizzazz. In many
cases, excellent examples are drawn from the
literature to demonstrate the methodological
points. This volume is a competent, authorita-
tive review of the state of injury research in
2001. It could serve admirably as the text for an
injury epidemiology research course in a school
of public health.
While Injury Control stands alone as an
excellent contribution to research in the field,
it would benefit from two additions. First, the
volume needs to be accompanied by a
"reader". That is, each chapter needs a set of
articles, or substantial excerpts from research
articles, that demonstrate the important
methodological points, whether specific uses
of methods, or strengths of approaches, or
limitations and biases of certain approaches.
Second, there needs to be a set of commentar-
ies that challenge the methodologists in our
field to think about our "future" research
needs. What are the problems that can't be
solved using the methods documented in this
volume? How will these new methods
emerge? Perhaps Injury Prevention would pub-
lish such a discussion.
Finally, in the first chapter of Injury Control,
Rivara reminds the reader of the volume by
Haddon, Suchman and Klein, Accident Research:
Methods and Approaches,published by the Associ-
ation for Crippled Children in 1964. Many of us
found that book in the 1970s when we began
working in the injury field. It filled us with
excitement and enthusiasm for this new field.
Not only did it document the state of the
science and art of that day, it challenged us to
address new and important research agendas.
After finishing Injury Control, go back to the
library and get out Accident Research!

Red light monitors save lives
An audit of California's red light enforcement cameras credits the technology with curbing accidents
but urges local governments to take better command of their programs. In the most exhaustive look
at the controversial cameras to date, the Bureau of State Audits examined seven of the 20 red light
programs in the state. The report released in July found that red light running accidents fell by 10% in
jurisdictions that use cameras since a 1996 state law authorized the technology. The drop was more pro-
nounced at the particular intersections where cameras were installed. At 10 intersections in the city of
Sacramento, red light related accidents fell by 44% since cameras went up, the audit found. The audit
surveyed the cities of Fremont, Long Beach, Oxnard, Sacramento, San Diego, San Francisco, and Los
Angeles County. The 110 page report also challenged two widespread notions about red light cameras--
that cities make money off the $281 tickets and that traffic engineers manipulate the yellow light times
on traffic signals to generate more tickets. Only the programs in Oxnard and San Diego have generated
significant revenue, according to the audit, while some cities have lost money in the process. Sacramento,
for example, lost $153 000 since the first cameras were installed three years ago, while San Francisco lost
nearly $1 million since its program started in 1996. Sacramento now pays its contractor $87 from every
$281 red light ticket, with the city keeping $9.30. The rest is divided among various state and county pro-
grams. And auditors found no evidence that yellow times have been decreased. In fact, yellow times at
three intersections in Sacramento were extended last year even though they met intervals established by
the state Department of Transportation. A copy of the audit is online at www.bsa.ca.gov/bsa/index.html
(from The Sacramento Bee, July 2002; submitted by Peter Jacobsen).
This rather bizarre story might make one believe that accident-proneness is more than a concept. Not
this man's lucky day.
Injured man survives brush with death near train tracks
A man who was hit by a train while passed out in his car after cutting his fingers in a household accident
has survived. Richard Paquette was driving to a clinic when he passed out near train tracks. A witness said
the car was dragged 30 metres before Mr Paquette awoke and managed to swing the car out of harm's
way. He was not hurt (from National Post (Canada), August 2002; submitted by Amy Zierler).
