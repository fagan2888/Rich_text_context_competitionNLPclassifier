Background and objectives: Sufficiently powered studies to investigate the CKD prevalence are few and do not cover
southern Europe.
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: For the INCIPE study, 6200 Caucasian patients >40 years old were randomly
selected in northeastern Italy in 2006. Laboratory determinations were centralized. The albumin to creatinine ratio in urine and
estimated GFR from calibrated creatinine (SCr) were determined. A comparison with 2001 through 2006 NHANES surveys was
performed.
Results: Prevalence of CKD was 13.2% in northeastern (NE) Italy (age and gender standardized to the U.S. 2007 Caucasian
population). Prevalence of CKD in U.S. Caucasians is higher (20.3%), the major difference being in CKD 3. Risk factors for
CKD are more prevalent in the United States than in Italy. With use of CKD 3a and 3b stages, CKD prevalence decreased in
NE Italy (8.5%) and in the United States (12.8%).
Conclusions: The prevalence of CKD is high in NE Italy, but lower than that in the United States. A large part of the
difference in CKD prevalence in NE Italy versus that in the United States is due to the different prevalence of CKD 3. The
higher prevalence of a number of renal risk factors in persons from the United States explains in part the different dimensions
of the CKD problem in the two populations.

According to a number of reports from different parts
of the world, the burden of chronic kidney disease
(CKD) is dramatically increasing (1). However,
many of such studies are not comparable because of different
criteria for defining CKD. In fact, screening has often been
limited to measuring only estimated GFR (eGFR), not includ-
ing the determination of albuminuria, which would offer
identification of CKD stages 1 and 2. Furthermore, the issue
of the serum creatinine assay and calibration has not been
adequately addressed by some, thus biasing comparison be-
tween different populations. Consequently, there are a few
large, sufficiently powered epidemiologic studies using sim-
ilar methodologies and these do not cover significant geo-
graphical areas. The NHANES surveys (2) have constituted
the template for CKD prevalence studies. Thus, all of the
most significant CKD epidemiology surveys compare with
them. In northern Europe, the Prevend (3) and the HUNT II
study (4) investigated CKD prevalence. No other sufficiently
powered study has been performed in Europe and in partic-
ular in the southern Mediterranean area which is known to
differ consistently from northern Europe regarding nutri-
tional habits and prevalence of pathologic conditions that
increase the risk of developing CKD.
Because of the perception of a large and increasing burden
of CKD in different parts of the world, the term "CKD
epidemics" has been coined. However, much of the contri-
bution to such a burden is due to CKD stage 3. The definition
of CKD 3 is based only on an eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2,
which has been questioned as being a reliable marker of

renal dysfunction, particularly in persons over 65 years and
women (5). Different CKD 3 definitions have thus been
proposed to better estimate the epidemiologic relevance of
the CKD (5).
To assess the prevalence of CKD in Italy, in 2006, in NE Italy,
we launched the "INCIPE" study (Initiative on Nephropathy,
of relevance to public health, which is Chronic, possibly in its
Initial stages, and carries a Potential risk of major clinical End-
points).
Materials and Methods
Recruitment of INCIPE Patients
The ethics committees of the involved institutions approved the
study protocol. For the INCIPE study 6200 patients, all Caucasians,
40-years old by January 1, 2006, were randomly chosen from the lists
of patients of 62 randomly selected general practitioners (GPs) based in
four geographical areas in the Veneto region, NE Italy. In Italy all
citizens receive free health insurance from the National Health System.
To this aim all are included in the list of patients of GPs of their own
choice. Thus, drawing participants from the GPs' lists is likely to draw
them directly from the community. Enrollment and clinical examina-
tion were performed locally in four units, by trained medical doctors.
Pregnant women were not enrolled. After written informed consent
was obtained, each participant completed a self-administered question-
naire (e.g., family and personal medical history, pharmacologic treat-
ments, and smoking habits). Patients were asked to refrain from smok-
ing beginning from the night before. BP, waist circumference, body
weight, and height were measured as in the NHANES study.
Freshly voided morning urine was collected. In menstruating women
the sample was btained a few days later. Standard urine examination
by a plastic strip (Aution Sticks 10 EA; Arkray, Menarini Diagnostics,
Firenze, Italy) was immediately performed.
Laboratory
Blood and urine samples were frozen at 80°C by 5 hours after
collection. All determinations were centralized (Verona General Hos-
pital, Central Laboratory).
With reference to the urine albumin assay we chose to prescreen the
samples with a strip test (Clinitek Microalbumin; Siemens Medical
Solutions Diagnostics, Mishawaka, IN) and to confirm the positive
results (3.4 mg/mmol creatinine) measuring albumin immunochemi-
cally by a specific antibody and a nephelometer (Immage 800; Beckman
Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA), and creatinine on RxL Dimension (Dade-
Behring, Inc., Newark, DE) using an alkaline picrate method as de-
scribed (6).
Serum creatinine (SCr) was measured using a kinetic rate Jaffe
method. For GFR estimation, SCr measurements were recalibrated to
standardized creatinine measurements obtained at The Cleveland
Clinic Research Laboratory as described (7).
NHANES Data
Only data from Caucasians (non-Hispanic whites) aged 40 years or
over in the NHANES 2001 through 2002, 2003 through 2004, and 2005
through 2006 surveys were considered (8).
CKD Classification
The GFR was estimated with the CKD Epidemiology Collaboration
(EPI) equation using calibrated creatinine (9). Albuminuria was defined
as an albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) 3.4 mg/mmol creatinine (6),
with microalbuminuria as an ACR of 3.4 mg/mmol (30 mg/g) to 33.9
mg/mmol (299 mg/g), and macroalbuminuria as an ACR 34 mg/
mmol (300 mg/g).
Definition of the five CKD stages was according to the KDOQI
classification (10). Stage 3 was also substratified into two classes: 3a,
GFR of 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 with ACR 3.4 mg/mmol creat-
inine; and 3b, GFR of 30 to 44 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
We have measured SCr and ACR at one time point only. Correct
classification of CKD requires confirmation of abnormalities over at
least a 3-month period. For the analysis of the NHANES data we used
the same criteria.
Definition of Clinical Phenotypes
Participants were classified as hypertensive when they reported hav-
ing received a diagnosis of hypertension and as diabetics when they
reported having received a diagnosis of diabetes or when found to have
fasting plasma glucose 126 mg/dl. Hypercolesterolemic individuals
were those with blood cholesterol levels 240 mg/dl. For metabolic
syndrome definition we used the American Heart Association/Na-
tional Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Scientific Statements (11). Peo-
ple who smoke (current and past) were those who had smoked 100
cigarettes in their entire life. Previous cardiovascular (CV) events in-
cluded self-reported diagnosis performed by a physician of coronary
heart disease, angina, heart attack, transitory ischemic attack, or stroke.
Statistical Analyses
The sample size was calculated by considering the estimated preva-
lence of asymptomatic renal dysfunction. Because there were no avail-
able data from the Italian population, we considered the prevalence of
patients with a creatinine clearance 50 ml/min, which was 13% in a
sample representative of the U.S. general population (12). A sample of
4345 patients is necessary to obtain an estimate precision of 1% with a
confidence level of 1    95% (nQuery Advisor 6.01). Assuming that
30% of patients were not willing to participate in the study, we singled
out 6200 patients from a total general population of 56,841 people.
Analyses of NHANES databases were performed by pooling data from
three survey periods as previously outlined and incorporating the
sampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates from the complex
NHANES sampling design.
The standard error of the mean (SEM) for all estimates was obtained
using the Taylor series (linearization) method following NHANES-
recommended procedures and weights.
A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate
the simultaneous effects of population (NHANES versus INCIPE), gen-
der, age, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases,
hypertension, and kidney disease history on CKD 3 to 5 and albumin-
uria. To investigate the effect of diabetes, hypertension, and gender on
CKD (all stages) in each study, we used separate logistic regression
models, considering diabetes and hypertension adjusted for age and/or
gender. The results were expressed as odds ratios (OR) with their 95%
confidence interval (95% CI).
The appropriate statistical methodology was used for complex sur-
vey analysis as recommended by the CDC in the continuous NHANES
tutorial (13).
In hypothesis testing, the level of significance was P  0.05. All the
analyses were performed with SAS 9.1.3 for Windows (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
In the INCIPE study, 3870 (62% of the randomized sample)
subjects were enrolled. Because we limited our analysis to
people with a complete data set, this report is based on 3629
Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 5: 1946­1953, 2010 Prevalence of CKD in Northeastern Italy 1947
subjects, a number lower than the calculated sample size. How-
ever, as the observed prevalence of CKD was much lower in the
INCIPE population than in the U.S. population (see below), the
chance of incorrect inference is marginal, even given the
slightly reduced sample size.
Participants in INCIPE had a mean age of 59.8 years, and
21.4% were 70 years; 47.8% were men (Supplemental Table 1;
the table also shows corresponding data in the NHANES sur-
vey). The clinical characterization of INCIPE and NHANES
populations is shown in Supplemental Table 2. The prevalence
of high SCr in the INCIPE population was about one third
compared with that in the NHANES population (1.2 versus
3.9%).
Table 1 shows the prevalence of CKD in the INCIPE study as
based on the KDOQI classification. Statistics for the CKD 5 class is
not shown in the INCIPE tables because only two patients were
recognized in this class. The overall prevalence of CKD was 12.7%.
After age and gender standardization of the INCIPE data to the
U.S. 2007 population (14), prevalence in NE Italy is 13.2%. Preva-
lence of CKD in the United States is much higher (20.3%) (Table 2),
the largest difference being in CKD 3 (Figure 1).
In both studies the eGFR was negatively associated with
older age: in the older than 70 years group compared with the
40- to 49-year old group the prevalence of GFR 30 to 59 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 (CKD 3) was 59 and 37 times higher, in NE Italy and
in the United States, respectively. Between these age classes, in
the oldest (70 years) the condition of GFR 90 was promi-
nently less prevalent (12 and 23 times lower in NE Italy and in
the United States, respectively). Actually, the GFR was gradu-
ally decreasing with age, by an average of 8.5 and 8.8 ml/min
per decade in the Caucasians from Italy and the United States,
respectively.
Prevalence of a number of CKD risk conditions is consis-
tently higher in the United States than in NE Italy in each age
class (Figure 2, Supplemental Table 2).
After adjustment for age and gender, in the INCIPE popula-
tion hypertensive individuals had 2.09-fold (95% CI 1.68, 2.61)
higher odds of CKD (all stages) compared with normotensive
patients. Similarly, individuals with diabetes had 2.66 (95% CI
2.03, 3.49) higher odds for CKD than individuals without dia-
betes. Very similar data were obtained in the NHANES Cau-
casians (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.61, 2.13; OR 2.51, 95% CI 2.05, 3.08,
respectively). Women (adjusted for age) were not revealed to
have an increased risk (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.72, 1.09 and OR 1.11,
95% CI 0.97, 1.28, in INCIPE and NHANES, respectively).
In both populations only a minority of CKD 3 patients had
micro-/macroalbumin excretion rate (AER); in particular, in
patients with GFR 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2, 4 of 5 had no
micro-/macro-AER (Table 3a and Table 3b, Supplemental Table
3). The prevalence of albuminuria was noticeably different
between genders in the CKD 3 stage in both populations (Sup-
plemental Table 3). Consequently, the prevalence of those CKD
3 patients with micro-/macro-AER was higher in men than in
women (29.9 and 15.1%, respectively, in NE Italy and 25.2 and
18.1%, respectively, in the United States).
When CKD 3a and 3b stages are used instead of a CKD stage
3, the total prevalence of patients with CKD (all stages) changes
considerably, from 12.7 to 8.5% in NE Italy and from 20.3 to
12.8% in the NHANES (Table 3) population, the differences
being homogeneously distributed among different age classes.
The risk of having CKD 3 to 5 is 2.7 times higher in the
NHANES population than in the INCIPE population after ad-
justment for differences in age, gender, diabetes, CV history,
hypertension, renal history, smoking, and obesity (Table 4).
The difference between the two populations remains sub-
stantially of the same extension if we analyze the risk of having
CKD 3b to 5. A major role in the two models is due to renal
history (Table 4).
Regarding the risk of having albuminuria, it also is higher in
the NHANES population, 45%, with diabetes having a major

of having CKD 3 to 5, they are at reduced risk of albuminuria.
Discussion
The INCIPE study is the first sufficiently large study ex-
ploring the prevalence of CKD in Italy and in southern
Europe. Only in a tiny minority of European countries do
data exist on the epidemiology of CKD. It is perhaps because
of this lack of information that just a few European countries
have started surveillance programs on the CKD epidemic
and even less put in place specific plans to halt it. We feel our
survey, by providing relevant information on CKD in one of
the most populous European countries, is an important ad-
dition to the knowledge base on this still overlooked prob-
lem and could fuel the interest of health agencies in imple-
menting preventive programs.
Major findings of the study are as follow: (1) abnormal
serum creatinine values are less frequent in persons from
Italy than in persons from the United States; (2) the preva-
lence of CKD is higher in the United States than in NE Italy;
(3) persons from NE Italy have lower prevalence of certain
renal risk factors than persons from the United States; (4) in
both populations CKD stage 3 represents most of the CKD.
Prevalence of CKD in the INCIPE and NHANES
Populations
The prevalence of CKD in Caucasians 40 years old is much
higher in the United States (20.3%) than in NE Italy (13.2%) and
this is confirmed also by the 3 times higher prevalence of
abnormal SCr values in the U.S. population. The two popula-
tions differ regarding a number of renal risk factors. Actually,
the prevalence of diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome
(Figure 2) is higher in persons from the United States. This may

explain why CKD appears to be more prevalent in the United
States than in NE Italy.
Another explanation could be that the CKD EPI equation for the
determination of the eGFR performs differently in persons from
Italy. This has been shown in other nationalities in reference to the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation (15).
However, in a study carried out by us, the MDRD formula per-
formed quite well in persons from Italy in whom GFR was mea-
sured with the iohexol clearance method (unpublished). Further-
more, the higher prevalence of micro- and macroalbuminuria in
the NHANES population (Supplementary Table 3) supports the
idea that CKD is really more prevalent in persons from the United
States.
Because our prevalence data are based on a single measure-
ment, we may have overestimated the true prevalence of CKD. If
we consider that 50% of microalbuminuric patients with GFR 90
ml/min per 1.73 m2 and 70% of those with GFR 60 to 89, and 100%
of the macroalbuminuric individuals have persistent albuminuria

(16), the total prevalence of CKD changes only modestly, from 12.7
to 10.8% in NE Italy and from 20.3 to 17.7% in the United States.
Prevalence of CKD 3 According to Different Definitions
The possibility exists that we are overestimating the preva-
lence of CKD because of the criteria used for CKD categoriza-
tion (17). Definition of CKD 3 is particularly questioned (17).
This stage is the most prevalent among all stages in both
populations with a dramatic increase in the more advanced age
classes (Figure 1).
It is not known which renal diseases explain the condition,
although part of these patients could simply have an aging kid-
ney. Actually, among patients with CKD 3, most are 60 years old
(91.4% in NE Italy and 87.3% in the United States) and the majority
have normoalbuminuria (77.9 and 78.1%), whereas only a few (6.1
and 5.1%) have macroalbuminuria.
CKD 3 is also more prevalent in women. However, the propor-
tion of them not disclosing abnormal AER is larger than that in
men (Supplemental Table 3). Thus, very few have evidence of
kidney damage. Actually, there is an opposite effect of the female
gender on the risk of having albuminuria (decreased) than of
having CKD 3 to 5 (Table 4), which may suggest an over-repre-
sentation of CKD stage 3 because of the underestimation of GFR in
women by the CKD EPI formula.
With subclassification of CKD 3 into CKD 3a and CKD 3b, the
prevalence of CKD (all stages) changes from 12.7 to 8.5% in NE
Italy and from 20.3 to 12.8% in the United States. The rationale for
such subclassification of the CKD stage 3 is that in these patients
it is the presence of abnormal albuminuria that plays a crucial role
in the determination of the CV and renal risk. In prospective
studies in the general population, Foster et al. (18) have shown that
risk of a CV event in CKD 3 without albuminuria is not increased

with respect to patients without CKD, whereas Hallan et al. (19)
have observed that both conditions increase the risk, but in the
presence of abnormal albuminuria the CV risk increases dramat-
ically. Furthermore, it has also been shown that most of the pa-
tients with CKD 3 have fairly stable renal function and that it is the
concurrence of abnormal albuminuria that imparts the risk of
progressive renal disease (20).
Risk Factors for CKD and Albuminuria in Both Populations
In the two populations the effect of hypertension (OR 2.09
versus 1.85 in INCIPE and NHANES, respectively) and diabetes
(2.66 versus 2.51) on the risk of having CKD (any stage) is
almost the same. However, as observed, the different preva-
lence of diabetes and hypertension, more frequent in the United
States, concurs in explaining the higher CKD prevalence in the
NHANES population. The finding that even after adjustment
for a number of variables the risk of having CKD 3 to 5 and
albuminuria is definitely higher in the NHANES population
(Table 4) than in the INCIPE population suggests a significant
role by other indeterminate factors.
Limitations of the Study
The study has a number of limitations. Some have been
discussed before. The participation of 60% was lower than
expected; however, for an epidemiologic, voluntary study it is
certainly good. In fact, whereas in the NHANES (2) and the
HUNT II (4) surveys the participation rate among those ap-
proached was 70%, in the Nijmegen Biomedical Study it was
only 29% (21). The reduced participation is probably the cause
of the distortion of the sample in terms of age and gender from
the randomized population, that is, a reduced representation of
the 4th decade of age, particularly in men, and of the 80 years
in women. However, differences are 6% of the crude frequen-
cies in each age and gender class, thus suggesting that such a
response bias is probably very modest.
The study enrolled only patients older than 40 years and thus
its data cannot be generalized to the whole population. How-
ever, the causal relationship of CKD with disorders such as
hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity--which
typically occur after the 4th decade of age--makes this section
of the population the most affected by CKD.
We have used the same cutoff for the definition of microalbu-
minuria in both genders, although most likely a higher one
should be used in women (22). Because of the two-steps strat-
egy used for the determination of albuminuria (a prescreening
of samples with a strip test and confirmation of positive results
measuring albumin immunochemically), because the cutoff for
strip-positive results--3.4 mg/mmol creatinine--is indepen-
dent of gender, we cannot analyze our data by considering
gender-specific ranges for albuminuria. However, others used
the same cutoff for both genders (4,16). Furthermore, the com-
parison between the two populations was not affected because
we used the same criteria in both. The opposite effect of gender
on the risk of CKD 3 to 5 and on abnormal albuminuria cannot
be influenced by such a definition because the use of a higher
cutoff for albuminuria in women would have magnified such a
divergence.
Conclusions
The prevalence of CKD is higher in the United States than in
NE Italy probably because of the higher prevalence of a number
of renal risk factors in persons from the United States. In both
populations the implementation of the definition of the CKD 3
stage with albuminuria impressively decreases the prevalence
of CKD because a large number of patients with GFR 60
ml/min do not have abnormal albuminuria.
