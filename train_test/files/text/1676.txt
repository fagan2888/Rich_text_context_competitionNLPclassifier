The possibility of genotype­environment inter-
action for memory performance and change was
examined in 150 monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs from
the Swedish Adoption Twin Study of Aging (SATSA).
We used an MZ twin pair difference approach to
examine the possibility that genotype was associ-
ated with intrapair variability and thus suggestive of
genotype­nonshared environment interactions.
Multiple `variability genes' were found for longitudi-
nal change in a semantic memory task including
candidates coding for apolipoprotein E (APOE) and
estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) as well as serotonin
candidates (HTR2A and 5HTT). One candidate also
related to variability in change in episodic memory
(5HTT). Of the significant associations observed,
generally results indicated that MZ pairs who carry
putative risk alleles were less variable than noncarri-
ers, suggesting that noncarriers may be more
sensitive to environmental contexts. We sought to
`contextualize' the possible nonshared environmen-
tal influences for found gene­environment (G × E)
effects by considering intrapair differences in mea-
sured social and stress factors, including social
support, life events and depressive symptoms.
Results suggested that nonshared environmental
influences associated with depressive symptoms
may moderate the G × E relationship observed for
ESR1 and APOE and longitudinal semantic memory
change whereby noncarriers of putative risk alleles
may be relatively more sensitive to depression-
evoking environmental contexts than carriers of the
risk allele. Thus, the contexts that facilitate or
reduce depressive symptoms may affect semantic
memory resiliency dependent on genotype. Further
work ought to consider larger sample sizes as well
as consider additional social and contextual factors.
Cognitive health in old age reflects accumulating bio-
logical, environmental and random influences over
the life course that may interact with one another.
With age, environmental factors, particularly person-
specific factors, play an increasingly important role in
individual differences in cognitive change across
domain (Reynolds et al., 2005). These nonshared
environmental influences may suggest the presence of
gene­environment interactions (G × E). If not directly
modeled, G × E will become part of the estimate for
nonshared environment (Falconer, 1989). Thus, it is
important to consider specific environmental factors
that may affect one's cognitive resiliency and to look
at how these may interact with genotypic characteris-
tics. However, relatively little is known about either
specific environmental candidates or specific gene
candidates for cognitive decline let alone potential
gene­environment interactions. The only gene to have
received much attention is APOE, which codes for
the primary cholesterol transporter in the brain,
apolipoprotein E (apoE). Social environment and
emotional influences on cognitive aging have received
little attention although some relatively recent find-
ings suggest stressful life experiences, social support,
and socioecomic factors may influence cognitive
change (e.g., Beland et al., 2006; Holtzman et al.,
2004; Sachs-Ericsson et al., 2005). No publications to
date have examined potential candidate gene­
environment interactions involving social factors and
cognitive aging traits.
Candidate Socio-Environmental Factors
Cognitive reserve in late life may be affected by early
life or mid-life environmental factors (see Borenstein
et al., 2006; Gatz et al., 2006). Indeed, the riches of
good cognitive health in older age may be dispropor-
tionately afforded to those who are socioeconomically
advantaged in early life, such that health-promoting
environments and behaviors may coalesce. Socio-
economic status (SES) and related factors have been
examined as measured environmental effects in
gene­environment interaction analyses for general
intelligence in adolescence (Harden et al., 2007),
dementia and AD (see Borenstein et al., 2006). Other
social and stress-related factors remain less well

studied in this regard. Social or stress-related factors
predictive of cognitive decline and/or dementia include
lower social engagement or support, stress, and higher
depressive symptoms.
Social Support
Lower social support and social engagement have
been associated with cognitive change in community-
based samples (e.g., Beland et al., 2005; Holtzman et
al., 2004). For example, poorer cognitive functioning
was associated with lower participation in community
activities and lower family support, while cognitive
decline over a period of 7 years was associated with
lower participation in community events at baseline
(Beland et al., 2005). It should also be noted that
changes in social participation can occur due to cogni-
tive decline. Cognitive loss can interfere with ability to
engage socially; or cognitive loss could create a greater
need for social support from family.
Stress
There is a strong argument based on rodent, primate,
and human studies that life stress that occurs early in
life or that is chronic may predispose to impaired hip-
pocampal functioning (e.g., Brunson et al., 2005;
Hibberd et al., 2000; Magri et al., 2006). There is also
some epidemiological evidence supporting an associa-
tion between life stress and poorer memory
performance (e.g., VonDras et al., 2005).
Depression
The occurrence of depressive symptoms may predict
later cognitive decline or dementia (Sachs-Ericsson et
al., 2005) although the relationship is unclear. In par-
ticular, depressive symptoms might be early indicators
of Alzheimer's disease (Wetherell et al., 1999) rather
than a risk factor. Indeed stress exposure may lead
both to increased depressive symptoms and cognitive
change (Duman, 2005).
Candidate Genes
Candidate genes for cognitive aging traits have been
less well studied than for the dementias such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dozens of candidates have
been examined with respect to AD with the APOE gene
showing the most consistent association (see Blomqvist
et al., 2006; Rogaeva et al., 2006). Relatively few can-
didate gene association studies have been published for
cognitive aging traits, and APOE is the most well
known candidate with associations found for cognitive
functioning in general although most consistently for
memory performance (see Anstey & Christensen,
2000). Mixed support has been observed for estrogen
receptor alpha (ESR1) and cognitive performance,
impairment and AD risk (e.g., Corbo et al., 2006;
Kravitz et al., 2006; Porrello et al., 2006; Prince et al.,
2001; Yaffe et al., 2002). Some studies have found
associations for women but not men (e.g., Porrello et
al., 2006) and where an association is found it is often
moderated by APOE e4 allele status. Indeed, a recent
study of men and women suggests that APOE
expression may mediate the relationship between ESR1
variants and AD risk (Corbo et al., 2006): low serum
apoE levels, as observed in those with AD, were
observed for ESR1 homozygotes for the PvuII and XbaI
variants that also carried the APOE e4 allele. The
extent to which ESR1 may be related to nonpathologi-
cal cognitive change is of interest.
In nondemented twins from the Swedish Adoption
Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) study we have observed
associations of APOE with working memory perfor-
mance and change, A2M (which codes for the apoE
ligand alpha2-macroglubulin) with episodic figural
memory change (Reynolds, Prince, et al., 2006), and
association of HTR2a (which codes for serotonin 2A
receptors) with episodic figural memory change
(Reynolds, Jansson, et al., 2006).
Gene­Environment Interaction
Psychosocial factors have been understudied as modi-
fiers of gene­phenotype relationships. Much of what we
know relates to physical environment factors or health-
related factors. For example, studies have indicated
moderation of the APOE e4 AD risk association by the
occurrence of head injury (e.g., Mayeux et al., 1995) and
low paternal SES (Moceri et al., 2000, 2001). The effects
of APOE e4 status coupled with head injury increased
the risk of AD ten-fold which well exceeded the additive
effect of each risk factor alone (Mayeux et al., 1995).
The increased risk of AD due to father's manual occupa-
tion level was only observed for those who were APOE
e4 positive (Moceri et al., 2001). Beyond SES, psychoso-
cial factors measured later in life have not yet been
examined as potential modifiers of the relationship
between APOE e4 and AD risk.
We know even less about gene­environment interac-
tions for cognitive traits. Neuropsychological
performance after head injury has been examined for
nondemented patients between the ages of 16 and 65
years where APOE e4 carriers showed worse cognitive
performance on verbal memory, attentional and percep-
tual speed tasks 6 months after the injury (Ariza et al.,
2006). APOE e4 status when coupled with untreated
hypertension predicted poorer cognitive performance in
participants from the Nurses' Health Study (Kang et al.,
2005). In terms of social factors, higher heritability esti-
mates for childhood and adolescent cognitive ability
have been observed as social status and prosperity levels
increase suggesting the presence of a G × E interaction
(see Harden et al., 2007).
In light of the findings described above that suggest
environmental influences may moderate the APOE cog-
nitive performance or dementia risk associations, APOE
may act as a `variability gene' for normative cognitive
change. Whereas typical candidate gene­phenotype asso-
ciation studies examine differences in phenotypic means
or disease risk by genotype or allele status, candidate
gene association with measures of trait variability, that
is, `variability genes' (Berg et al., 1989), can be viewed as
testing gene­environment interaction (Berg et al., 1989;

Martin, 2000; Martin et al., 1983). A primary strategy is
to make use of MZ twins given that within-pair differ-
ences would reflect nonshared environmental influences.
For example, Magnus and colleagues (Magnus et al.,
1981) observed that MZ twin pairs who carried the M
allele in the MN blood system showed less intrapair vari-
ation for serum cholesterol values than MZ pairs who
were NN homozygotes. If within-pair differences varied
by genotype (e.g., M+ or NN status) that would indicate
the presence of gene-nonshared environment interac-
tions, that is, differential sensitivity to the environment
dependent on genotype. In the spirit of Berg et al.
(1989), the extent to which APOE may be a `variability
gene' in adolescence was examined by comparing
within-pair differences among MZ twins for several lipid
and lipoprotein traits (plasma cholesterol, triglycerides,
and LDL cholesterol, and apoB and apoE lipoproteins)
stratified by APOE phenotypes (de Knijff et al., 1993).
Patterns of findings suggested that apoE e3e4 pairs were
less variable than e2e3 or e3e3 pairs for plasma choles-
terol, LDL cholesterol, and apoE lipoprotein across all
methods to assess intrapair differences. However, the
intrapair differences amongst the different apoE pheno-
type classes were not significant. The authors concluded
that APOE may not be a variability gene for these
plasma lipids and lipoproteins in adolescence.
The Current Study
Although it appears that APOE may not be a variabil-
ity gene in adolescence per se (de Knijff et al., 1993),
APOE and other relevant gene candidates may act as
variability genes in later adulthood. Longitudinal
growth curve analyses of cognitive measures tapping
memory abilities (Information, Digit Span, and
Thurstone Picture memory task) indicate increasing
genetic influences with age that may suggest that in
late life new genes come `online', or genetic influences
may become amplified. Indeed, prior studies have sug-
gested APOE as a candidate for differential memory
change. Of particular interest for the current study is
the accumulating nonshared environmental variance
for all verbal, spatial, memory and perceptual speed
traits. The increasing nonshared environmental vari-
ance may suggest accumulations of environmental and
random factors, as well as unspecified genotype-envi-
ronment interaction (Falconer, 1989). The extent to
which APOE and other candidates such as ESR1 and
HTR2a may be variability genes for memory change is
unknown. In the present study on gene­environment
interaction we consider APOE as well as other puta-
tive AD candidates to consider whether they influence
variability in nonpathological memory change. Using
an MZ pair differences approaches (e.g., Berg et al.,
1989; Martin, 2000; Martin et al., 1983) we ask the
following questions:
1. Is there evidence for genotype­environment inter-
actions for cognitive change traits that tap memory
abilities?
2. Do any genotype­environment interactions for
cognitive change involve measured social support
factors, stress, and depressive symptoms?
Methods
Sample
The analyses focused on 150 MZ pairs in SATSA (see
Finkel & Pedersen, 2004; Pedersen et al., 1991) with
data available on the selected cognitive tests from up
to five waves of in-person testing (IPT). Of the 150
MZ pairs, 88 were female and 62 were male.
Incompleteness of data resulted in variable patterns of
data available for the estimated growth parameters
(described below). Analyses of cognitive ability level
included 148 to 150 pairs. Analyses of linear change
included 113 to 121 pairs whilst analysis of nonlinear
change included 67 to 72 pairs. In 112 MZ pairs both
cognitive and genotype information were available.
Zygosity status was established through serological
analysis or analysis of DNA markers for 89% of the
total 150 MZ pairs while for 11% zygosity was
assigned through questionnaire methods. The accu-
racy of the questionnaire-based methods used is about
98% in adult twins (Lichtenstein et al., 2002). Of the
112 MZ pairs with both genotypic plus cognitive
data, 96% had zygosity established by serological or
DNA marker analysis. In the remaining 4% (four
pairs) only one twin had available DNA information
and questionnaire-based zygosity was used.
Dementia status was known for twins in the study
with diagnostic information available up to May 2006
based on in-person work-up (through 2001) or
medical registry diagnosis (up to May, 2006). We set
to missing cognitive data that occurred after the esti-
mated age of onset for any twins identified as
demented. Subsequently, 22 pairs where one or both
became demented had at least one time point of cogni-
tive data prior to age of onset in the current study
(three pairs were concordant for dementia). Of the 22
pairs, 12 pairs had at least two time-points (one con-
cordant for dementia) and only three pairs had three
or more time points prior to age on onset (none con-
cordant for dementia).
Measures
Cognitive Measures
For the present study, we selected memory-related
measures for which prior analyses indicated increases
in nonshared environmental variance (Reynolds et al.,
2005). All tap some aspect of memory: (a)
Information subtest, a typical test of crystallized intel-
ligence requires semantic memory (Jonsson &
Molander, 1964); (b) Digit Span, the sum of forward
and backward includes working memory and attention
(Jonsson & Molander, 1964); and (c) Thurstone Picture
Memory recognition task requires nonverbal episodic
memory (Thurstone, 1938). Prior to growth model

analysis, all scores were transformed to a per cent
correct scale.
Nonlinear growth curve models were fit to all
SATSA twins for Information and Thurstone Picture
Memory performance data from up to five time points
and using full maximum-likelihood estimation of fixed
and random effects (cf. Finkel et al., 2003; Reynolds et
al., 2005; Reynolds, Jansson, et al., 2006) ignoring pair
dependency. (Not accounting for pair status could
affect standard errors of the average growth parame-
ters, but significance testing was not of interest in this
phenotypic analysis whose object was to estimate to
individual growth parameters.) The growth curves were
centered at age 65 years and thus the intercept and
linear slope reflected the average ability and rate of
change at 65 years, respectively, and the quadratic
parameter the acceleration in change throughout the
age range. A linear model was fit to the Digit Span data
as the quadratic model was not supported; thus, the
linear slope was constant throughout the age range.
Individual empirical Bayes (EB) estimates were
requested for the growth parameters. EB estimates for
linear and quadratic were set to missing if there were
fewer than two time points (linear) or fewer than three
time points (quadratic). For the current study, data
were only considered for further analysis if participants
were members of MZ pairs and where both in the pair
had available EB estimates.
Social and Stress Measures
Measures tapping social support and life events were
available from the first in-person assessment (IPT1).
Depressive symptoms using the CES-D scale (Center
for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression; Radloff, 1977)
were available from the second in-person assessment
(IPT2).
Social support. Nine questions from an adapted
version of the ISSI (Henderson et al., 1980) measured
observed and perceived social support. Each of the
questions determined the quantity of support of
various types (number of friends, family, etc, that one
could rely on) and perceived support; that is, how sat-
isfactory was the support that they received.
Responses to the observed support items and per-
ceived support items were separately standardized and
summed to quantify objective and subjective support,
respectively (see Bergeman et al., 1990).
Life Events. Twenty life event items (e.g., retirement,
death of child, divorce) from an adapted version of the
Social Readjustment Rating Scale (Holmes & Rahe,
1967; Persson, 1980) were weighted by the respon-
dent's rating of perceived importance ratings and
summed (Plomin et al., 1990). In addition, a subset of
events that were considered `uncontrollable' were
weighted and summed.
Depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms were
measured by the CES-D measure (Center for
Epidemiologic Studies-Depression; Radloff, 1977).
The current analyses used the total score based on a
sum of 20 items rated on a 0- to 3-point scale.
Genotypes
Genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from
blood samples collected during the third in-person
measurement occasion (IPT3). Genotyping of 16 SNPs
across 15 candidates are available for the present
analyses, including: Apolipoprotein E (APOE), 2-
macroglobulin (A2M), angiotensin converting enzyme
(ACE), advanced glycosylation end product-specific
receptor (AGER), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE),
cathepsin D (CTSD), dihydrolipoamide s-succinyl-
transferase (DLST), estrogen receptor 1 alpha (ESR1),
serotonin 5-HT-2A receptor (HTR2A), 5-hydrox-
ytryptamine transporter (5HTT), insulin-degrading
enzyme (IDE), interleukin 1 receptor alpha (ILA1),
low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(LRP1), nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3), tumor necro-
sis factor receptor superfamily, member 6 gene
(TNFRSF6). Most were prior candidates for AD (see
Blomqvist et al., 2006), and others for depression and
normative memory performance. The candidates can
be loosely organized in terms of pathways, such as
those connected to amyloid deposition (APOE, A2M,
BCHE, CATD, LRP1), cardiovascular disease (ACE),
estrogen (ESR1), inflammation (AGER, ILA1,
TNFRFS6), insulin (IDE), oxidation (NOS3, DLST),
and serotonin (5HTT, 5HTR2A). In 28% of the 112
informative MZ pairs (cognitive data plus genotype
information) only one twin was genotyped and the
resultant genotypes were assigned to both twins.
Identification of the candidate SNP's are available
in Appendix A. With the exception of the 5HTT and
5HTR2A candidates, all SNPS (or insertion-deletion)
were sequenced using the dynamic allele-specific
hybridization (DASH) method (Prince & Brookes,
2001; Prince et al., 2001). Details of genotyping for
the 5HTT and 5HTR2A candidates are described in
Jansson et al. (2003). Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium
(HWE) was tested using all available SATSA twins by
randomly splitting MZ and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs
into two samples and testing HWE on both samples.
HWE was found for 14 of 15 candidates in both
samples (p  .05). LRP1 failed in one out of the two
twin samples tested. Resequencing of LRP1 excluded
genotyping error; rather, the rarity of the TT genotype
may have led to significance. Bonferroni correction
based on 15 tests suggested LRP1 would achieve
HWE.
Analyses
Analyses proceeded in three stages. First, we tested for
heterogeneity using the method proposed by Fisher
(1925) before proceeding to test whether G × E effects
may be present for the empirical Bayes (EB) estimates.
This was done for untransformed EB estimates as well
as for rank-normalized EB estimates. Second, to test
for specific candidate gene­environment interactions
we conducted variance ratio tests (Martin et al., 1983)

N = number of pairs; EB = Empirical Bayes estimates calculated from growth model fitted using SAS Proc MIXED; SE = standard error =
for each gene candidate where significant heterogeneity
was found for the EB estimates. Lastly, we examined
the association of absolute pair differences in EB esti-
mates of cognitive change (linear or quadratic) to
absolute pair differences in social and stress measures
in a series of regression analyses. Transformations of
the absolute pair difference variables were necessary to
reduce nonnormality. For the social environment pair
difference variables log transformation to base 10 was
used. However, pair differences in EB growth parame-
ter estimates were resistant to typical transformation
and thus we rank-normalized and standardized the
absolute pair difference values prior to analysis.
Results
Heterogeneity Tests
We first performed heterogeneity tests as outlined by
Fisher (1925; see also Martin et al., 1983). The results
of this test, if significant, would suggest mixtures of
distributions of differences, and thus would give some
confidence to proceed with formal tests of candidate
G × E. The Fisher (1925) heterogeneity test in effect
compares the mean of squared pair differences to the
mean of absolute pair differences. The comparison is
expected to be greater than 0, thus we used a one-
tailed significance criteria. Table 1 reports the findings
for untransformed and rank-normalized EB estimates
for growth, to examine the extent to which rescaling
may reduce the potential G × E effect. A t statistic was
constructed with degrees of freedom based on the
number of MZ pairs less one. Generally the observed
heterogeneity effects for the untransformed EB growth
parameters estimates were resistant to rescaling
although not invariably, that is, the intercept for
Information became nonsignficant and the quadratic
change estimate for Thurstone's Picture Memory task
was at trend significance. However, transformation
may remove true G × E effects and thus we proceeded
with G × E variance ratio tests on untransformed vari-
ables although caution is warranted in over
interpretation of effects.
Variance Ratio Test: G ×
× E
After finding evidence of heterogeneity, we proceeded
with tests of genotype­environment interaction for all
gene candidates, where we compared within-pair differ-
ences for those pairs who carried a putative risk allele
versus those who did not carry the risk allele (e.g.,
APOE e4 carriers versus noncarriers; see Martin et al.,
1983). The results of the variance ratio test will suggest
whether particular genotypes may be more sensitive to
as yet anonymous nonshared environmental factors,
resulting in greater environmental variability, or those
that may be relatively impervious to environmental
factors and show smaller environmental variability.
Based on prior literature we identified particular alleles
as being risk alleles (e.g., APOE e4) and otherwise the
less frequent allele was considered as the risk allele.
Mean squared errors (MSE) for each genotype were esti-
mated from analysis of variance (ANOVA) of twin pair
number predicting the estimated EB growth parameter
estimates. The variance ratio test was then conducted by
taking the largest MSE over the smaller MSE and com-
paring the resulting F statistic to the appropriate
one-sided F-table and then doubling the p value as this
is considered a two-tailed test with no specific predic-
tion of which genotype group would show the larger

variance. In addition we report the ratio of MSEs of the
risk versus nonrisk groups (see Tables 2 and 3). If the
risk to nonrisk ratio is above 1.0 then the MZ pairs who
are risk allele carriers show greater intrapair variability
and would be characterized as more sensitive to environ-
mental factors than noncarriers. If the risk ratio is less
than 1.0 then the risk allele carriers show less variability
than noncarriers; in this case, those who carry risk alleles
would be characterized as relatively more impervious to
environmental factors.
Semantic Memory (Information)
Table 2 reports variance ratio tests for the linear and
quadratic EB estimates for Information. Results indi-
cate significant G × E effects for the linear change
component at 65 years for ESR1 and 5HTT where
those with the risk alleles were more than two times as
variable as noncarriers. Results indicate multiple signifi-
cant G × E effects for the quadratic change component
for: (1) APOE, ESR1 and 5HTR2A where carriers
were less variable than noncarriers, and (2) 5HTT and
LRP1 where carriers were three times as variable as
noncarriers (see Figure 1). Trend significance was
observed for ACE. The intercept (information perfor-
mance at 65 years) also exhibited two significant
genotype­environment interactions (not shown in Table
2): CATD with a ratio of .21 and HTT with a ratio of
1.92. Trend significance was observed for APOE with a
ratio of .57 for the risk allele carriers (e4) versus
nonrisk MZ pairs. Overall, ESR1 and 5HTT both
showed association with intrapair variability for the
linear and quadratic EB estimates. However, ESR1 risk
carriers show greater intrapair variability in linear slope
at age 65 years yet smaller intrapair variability in qua-
dratic estimates (as well as for intercept although not
significant). For 5HTT, risk carriers showed signifi-
cantly higher variability in intercept, linear trend at age
65 and quadratic than nonrisk carriers.

recognition test. Results indicate significant G × E
effects for the linear change component at 65 years for:
(1) CATD where those carrying the risk allele were less
variable than noncarriers, and (2) IDE where those car-
rying the risk allele were more variable than
noncarriers. Results indicate one significant F test for
the quadratic change component for 5HTT where risk
allele carriers were less variable than noncarriers (see
Figure 1). Thus, the results for Thurstone suggested one
common candidate with Information, 5HTT. Unlike
that for Information, 5HTT risk carriers showed lower
intrapair variability in the quadratic component for
Thurstone indicating less sensitivity to the environment
than nonrisk carriers. ESR1 showed a similar pattern in
variance for quadratic estimates to that found for
Information of lessened variability for carriers than
noncarriers but was not significant (p = .10).

were conducted for Digit Span.
Social and Stress Factors
Variance ratio tests indicated genotype­environment
interaction for memory-related cognitive change.
However, while the gene candidates were specified, the
environmental factors were anonymous. Thus, our last
step was to consider the possibility that social or
stressful environmental components may be associated
with the observed genotype­environment interactions
described above. In particular it was striking that
certain candidates may be implicated within-trait and
across-trait growth parameters, that is, ESR1 and
5HTT. Rather than compute all possible tests of asso-
ciation with social and stress factors we first

conducted a screen of possible correlation of absolute
pair differences in social and stress factors with
absolute pair differences in linear and quadratic EB
growth parameter estimates for the Information
subtest and Thurstone Picture Memory Task. Nonzero
correlations might suggest that nonshared environ-
mental influences are in common between social and
stress factors and nonshared environmental influences
observed for cognitive change. As described above it
was necessary to transform the pair difference vari-
ables to reduce nonnormality. Table 4 presents
Pearson correlation coefficients for the transformed
pair difference variables. The correlations reflect the
extent to which pair differences in social factors are
associated with pair differences in cognitive change.
The number of pairs varies widely for each social
factor considered given that both members of the pair
must have sufficient cognitive data as well. We consid-
ered correlations above .20 for further regression
analysis. Pair differences in the quadratic parameter
for Information were associated with pair differences
in CES-D scores at .25, p < .05. For pair differences in
linear and quadratic components of Thurstone Picture
Memory, the correlations with pair differences in life-
events were above .20, although significance tests
suggested p values that exceeded .05 in both cases.
Correlations remained essentially the same when pairs
where one or both were demented were excluded.
Regression analyses were conducted next to
examine whether gene candidates and stress factors
identified in G × E and correlation analyses, respec-
tively, might predict intrapair differences in cognitive
change, that is, linear (Thurstone) and quadratic
components (Information and Thurstone; see Table
5). Of particular interest is to consider whether geno-
type might interact with pair differences in the
measured stress factors in their relationship with pair
dissimilarity in cognitive change. If so, this would
suggest the presence of differential genotypic sensitiv-
ity to particular nonshared environmental factors.
That is, we hoped to identify the nonshared `E' in the
G × E analyses conducted. The gene candidate pre-
dictors (G) were coded such that those carrying the
risk allele were coded 1 and noncarriers were coded
as 0. The transformed absolute intrapair differences
in stress factors identified in the correlation analyses
(total life events and CES-D) were considered the
nonshared environmental factor (E) in the analyses.
Finally, we constructed an interaction by multiplying
the two predictors (G × E). Thus, a significant main
effect of genotype (G) would indicate the effect for
risk allele carriers on absolute intrapair difference in
the cognitive change parameter, that is, whether
genotype is associated with differential environmen-
tal variability for carriers versus noncarriers. A
significant E effect would suggest that environmental
variability for stress or social factors was associated
with environmental variability for cognitive change.
A significant interaction (G × E) would indicate a dif-
ferential effect of genotype on the relationship of
environmental variability for the social or stress
factor (E) with the environmental variability in the
cognitive change parameter.
Two of eight regression analyses suggested a sig-
nificant interaction of genotype by pair differences in
stress. Both the APOE e4 and ESR1 candidates
showed an interaction with pair differences in CES-D
on absolute intrapair difference in the quadratic com-
ponent for Information (see Table 5). As indicated by
the regression analysis results, greater pair differences
in CES-D scores are associated with greater pair dif-
ferences in nonlinear change in Information
performance over age for noncarriers of the APOE e4
and ESR1 risk alleles (see Figures 1 and 2). The
results suggest greater sensitivity to environmental
factors associated with depressive symptoms for those
who do not carry risk alleles (i.e., APOE e4 or ESR1
g allele, respectively). Results were essentially

Discussion
The current study suggests the presence of gene­envi-
ronment interaction for memory-related cognitive
change, particularly for tasks requiring semantic or
episodic memory. Possible candidate variability genes
were identified as well as measured environmental
factors that may moderate genetic effects on cognitive
change. The candidate variability genes imply the
involvement of serotonin, estrogen, and cholesterol
pathways while the measured social and stress envi-
ronmental factor indicate a possible role for
depression-relevant environmental features that may
moderate associations between genes and cognitive
change on semantic memory.
Variance ratio tests suggested genotype-environ-
ment interactions for age-related change in
memory-loaded cognitive tasks. Multiple `variability
genes' were identified for cognitive change, in particu-
lar, the ESR1 and HTT candidates. Furthermore,
nonshared environmental influences attributable to
depressive symptoms may reflect in part the non-
shared environmental influences for semantic memory
change that interact with genotype, but only for those
who do not carry the APOE e4 allele or noncarriers of
the ESR1 risk allele. Thus, noncarriers of these two
candidates may be more sensitive to depression-induc-
ing or depression-reducing elements of the
environment than those who carry the risk allele and
thus show greater variation in semantic memory
change. Put the other way, those who carry the risk
allele may be relatively less affected by alterations in
the environment.
The identification of APOE and ESR1 as variabil-
ity genes for accelerating change in the semantic
memory task (Information) is of interest given the
well-known association of APOE and possibly ESR1
with cognitive change and AD risk as well as evidence
suggesting that the association between ESR1 variants
with AD risk may be mediated by apoE expression
(Corbo et al., 2006). APOE has been associated with
compromised semantic memory performance in non-
demented adults where e4 carriers demonstrated
poorer performance on word fluency tasks than non-
carriers (Rosen et al., 2005). However, differential
preclinical memory profiles have not been routinely
noted for APOE e4 carriers versus noncarriers
(Estevez-Gonzalez et al., 2004).
The identification of serotonin-related candidates
5HTT and HTR2A as variability genes implicates the
serotonin system in variability in memory-related cog-
nitive change. We note a prior association with
5HTR2A and degree of episodic figural memory
change (Thurstone) over age (Reynolds, Jansson, et
al., 2006). In the current study HTR2A was only asso-
ciated as variability gene for quadratic change for
semantic memory (Information). Given that serotonin
candidates have been associated primarily with differ-
ential risk of depressive disorders, we find it surprising
that there was a lack of interaction between intrapair
differences in CES-D and 5HTT or 5HTR2A affecting
environmental variability for semantic memory or
episodic figural memory change.
Intrapair variability for depressive symptoms were
positively associated with intrapair differences in
semantic memory change but only for those who do
not carry an APOE e4 allele (i.e., APOE e2e2, e2e3,
or e3e3 genotypes), or those who do not carry the
ESR1 risk allele. Altogether, those who do not carry
the risk allele for APOE or ESR1, respectively, may be
more sensitive to depression-inducing or depression-
reducing elements of the environment. This might
suggest that interventions for maintaining cognitive
resiliency, including reducing stressors that otherwise
could lead to increases in depressive symptoms, would
have greater impact for those who do not carry risk
alleles. This may paint a rather deterministic picture
for APOE e4 carriers at first glance. Yet, evidence sug-

gests that individuals carrying even two copies of the
e4 alleles do not inevitably get AD even in late old age
(see Rogaeva et al., 2006). Furthermore, multiple clin-
ical studies of adults suggest that APOE e4 carriers
may respond better to interventions that moderate
dietary fat (e.g., via better lipid profiles) than noncar-
riers (see Corella & Ordova, 2005), although
standardized replication studies are needed in light of
the many negative studies reported. Put more properly
into perspective, our results suggest that there may be
a narrower range of environmental factors that one
could target for intervention for APOE and ESR1 risk
allele carriers.
In prior analyses of candidate gene association
with mean differences in cognitive change in nonde-
mented SATSA twins, APOE was associated with
change in the working memory measure Digit Span
(Reynolds, Prince, et al., 2006), but was not likewise

identified as a variability gene for working memory in
the present study. However, in the former study the
amplified decline was observed for e4 homozygotes,
whereas in the present study we considered e4 hetero-
and homzygotes together for sample size
considerations. Similarly, A2M and 5HTR2A were
associated with mean differences in episodic figural
recognition change over age (Thurstone Picture
Memory) in prior studies (Reynolds, Jansson, et al.,
2006; Reynolds, Prince, et al., 2006) but in the present
case neither were identified as `variability genes' for
episodic figural recognition change.
Thus far we have focused the discussion on well-
known gene candidates or those showing multiple
associations with growth parameters within and in
one case across cognitive tests. Other variability genes
may include CATD and IDE. The current findings
suggest CATD is predictive of differential environmen-
tal variability in semantic memory performance at 65
years (Information) and both CATD and IDE as pre-
dictive of differential environmental variability for
linear change at 65 years, that is, turning points, for
episodic figural memory performance (Thurstone).
However, there is little to suggest what the environ-
mental contexts might be amongst the social and
stress factors considered.
Overall, sample sizes may limit the ability to find
associations for the growth parameter indices of
change because multiple time points are required to
estimate them. Low power of the variance ratio test to
find G × E effects could have hampered efforts further
(see Martin et al., 1983). Where multiple associations
were found they were found primarily within rather
than across traits, that is, the Information subtest,
which may be explained in part by correlation among
the growth parameters. The variation in the growth
parameters estimated reflects systematic growth vari-
ance given the fitted quadratic model; that is,
occasion-specific error is removed, which may have
aided the current study in finding the reported associa-
tions although sample size was constrained.
Additional studies ought to be considered to see if the
identified gene candidates are replicated.
Limitations
Limitations of the current study include the use of a
two-stage procedure to analyze G × E effects on cogni-
tive change. We estimated EB indices of growth
parameters prior to conducting separate heterogeneity
or variance ratio tests on multiple correlated growth
parameter facets. Type I error rate may be a concern
because of the multiple tests conducted (15 candidates
per growth parameter considered). We screened first
for evidence of heterogeneity and then proceeded to
variance ratio tests which reduced the number of tests
required. We then observed eight significant findings
out of 45 tests for Information across intercept, linear
slope and quadratic, three of 30 tests for Thurstone
across linear slope and quadratic, and none out of 15
tests for Digit Span for the linear slope. If we applied a
Bonferroni adjustment within cognitive trait assuming
moderate correlation amongst growth parameters,
only the 5HTT and APOE candidates would remain
significant for the linear and quadratic terms for the
Information subtest as identified. We also reduced the
number of regression analyses with putative
social/stress factors by examining the presence of asso-
ciation between intrapair differences in social-stress
factors with intrapair differences in cognitive change
before proceeding to analyses including genotype. In
so doing we may have missed possible antagonistic
interaction effects.
Two of the cognitive tests considered are not `pure'
measures of memory per se, that is, Information and
Digit Span. Information taps semantic memory but is
more commonly considered a marker of crystallized
intelligence. We used the sum of forward and back-
ward Digit Span. Digit Span forward may more
prominently tap attention, although working memory
is captured by backward Digit Span. Altogether we
may be measuring memory-relevant general cognition
rather than select memory process.
Scaling factors and true G × E may both lead to
evidence of heterogeneity (Martin, 2000), a precursor
to testing for variance differences by genotypes in the
present study. Rescaling the growth parameters using
a rank-normalization procedure did not result in the
disappearance of all significant heterogeneity, particu-
larly for the linear and quadratic parameters.
Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that
the present results may in part reflect scaling artifacts
rather than true G × E. Replication studies using other
twin samples and other cognitive measures are needed.
The G × E analyses necessarily included complete
MZ twin pairs such that both members had to have
data from at least one cognitive testing occasion to be
considered for tests of intercept, two or more occa-
sions for tests of linear slope, and three or more
occasions for tests of the quadratic parameter. If G ×
E interaction effects were present for age at death or
dropout this could have biased the current results.
For example, if APOE e4 allele status was associated
with attrition then the remaining e4 positive pairs
may be less variable on verbal change due to their
joint survival.
Conclusions
The current study highlights the importance of gene-
context interplay on longitudinal cognitive resilience
and decline in humans. Ours is the first to suggest
`variability genes' for cognitive aging phenotypes.
Variability genes include the well-known candidate
APOE as well as ESR1, 5HTR2A, 5HTT, CATD and
IDE. Most associations were found for variability in
change in a task tapping semantic memory although
one common candidate related to variability in change
in episodic memory (5HTT). Nonshared environmen-
tal influences associated with depressive symptoms

may moderate the G × E relationship observed for
ESR1 and APOE and variation in change for semantic
memory. Noncarriers of putative risk alleles may be
relatively more sensitive to environmental change;
thus, the contexts that facilitate or reduce depressive
symptoms may also lead to semantic memory decline
or resiliency, suggesting a target for interventions.
However, replications of the identified variability
genes and further work on other social and contextual
factors are warranted.
