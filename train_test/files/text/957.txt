Background. The population aged 65 and older is often analyzed in three categories: young-old (65­74), middle-old
(75­84), and oldest-old (85). This may blind heterogeneity within the oldest category. New, large data sets allow ex-
amination of the very oldest-old (e.g., aged 95) and contrasts with those who are younger.
Methods. We determined the annual change of prevalence of physical and cognitive function, and of disease prob-
lems in the old to very oldest-old, using data from existing Resident Assessment Instrument records from nursing homes
in seven states during 1992­1994. We used data from 193,467 unique residents aged 80 or older, including 6,556 resi-
dents aged 100 or older. We computed the prevalence, by age, of selected conditions: physical and cognitive function,
diseases, problem behavior, mood disturbance, restraint use, falls, weight loss, eating less, body mass index, chewing
and swallowing problems, incontinence (bowel and bladder), catheter use, and selected diagnoses.
Results. Prevalence of all measures of physical and cognitive dysfunction increased most rapidly with each year of
age among the very oldest-old. Most of the slope changes occurred from 95 to 100 years of age. Such changes are less
pronounced or not seen in measures of disease prevalence.
Conclusions. Accelerated change in prevalence of dysfunction seen in the nursing home population may suggest a
change in the mechanisms of aging that occur after the mid-nineties. Examination of the very oldest-old may provide
new insight into the nature of the aging process.
HE population of the United States, as of virtually all
the world, is aging rapidly and with the greatest relative
change in the oldest-old group. From 1960 to 1990, when
the total U.S. population grew by 39%, the number of per-
sons aged 65 or older increased by 89%, and those aged 85
or older increased by 232% (1). By 2030, older Americans
aged 65 or older could represent 25% (12% currently) of the
population, because the size of younger populations will
have declined (2,3).
These demographic changes are of considerable impor-
tance, for although the oldest-old account even now for only
1.2% of the entire population and only 10% of those aged
65 or older, they disproportionately use the health care sys-
tem, often at public expense. For example, Pawlson in 1994
calculated that the rate of nursing home institutionalization
is 1,800% greater for those aged 85 or older than for those
aged 65­74 (4).
Despite the importance of the aging population, there has
been little research specifically aimed at the population
aged 90 and older or 95 and older. Prior research often
grouped subjects into an older than 85 category, despite
some evidence of differences in the resource utilization of
nonagenarians and centenarians compared with younger se-
niors. One study found that average total cost per hospital-
ization progressively declines after ages 70­79. In fact, it
suggested that the oldest-old may be a select group of indi-
viduals who are healthier than the younger cohorts (5).
The division of the elderly population into three age
groups--the young-old (often 65­74 years), the middle-old
(75­85 years), and the oldest-old (85 years)--was sug-
gested by Suzman and Riley (6), although they noted that
the thresholds for each group are somewhat arbitrary and
that future definitions of the last category might more ap-
propriately be advanced to older ages. Still, such classifica-
tion is widely accepted and responds to the differences
across these three age brackets in physical and mental
health and in the use of care resources (7,8).
Our research focuses on the characteristics of the oldest-
old by using data newly available from one subpopulation:
those in nursing homes. With extremely large sample
sizes--full nursing home populations for multiple states--
we can examine the multiple dysfunctions, morbidities and
comorbidities, disabilities, and disease diagnoses seen in
nonagenarians and centenarians in this setting. Although
many researchers focus on age 85 as a critical age for accel-
erated decline, we consider whether there is yet another age
threshold, in the nineties, at which the structure of the aging
process changes again. If true, this suggests a more ad-
vanced segment of the age continuum: a fourth era--the
very oldest-old--consisting of those aged 95 or older.

METHODS
In this study, we examined the relationship between the
prevalence of selected conditions and age in those aged 80
to 105 years.
Data
We selected all individuals aged 80 or older from data
representing all nursing home residents in seven states dur-
ing 1992­1994. The states were New York, Kansas, Missis-
sippi, South Dakota, Maine, Nebraska, and Pennsylvania.
When we had multiple assessments of the same individual,
we chose only the most recent assessment, i.e., each indi-
vidual at the oldest age. All assessments were performed us-
ing the National Resident Assessment Instrument (RAI)/
Minimum Data Set (MDS) mandated for use in virtually ev-
ery nursing home in the United States (all homes eligible to
receive federal funding under Conditions of Participation)
on resident admission and significant change, and at least
annually. The assessment is performed by facility staff, us-
ing all available sources of information, including the resi-
dent, staff, family, and the medical record.
The MDS, with more than 350 items, covers a broad set
of domains, including physical and mental function, dis-
eases, psychosocial status, mood and behavior disturbances,
continence, and treatments (9). In multiple studies, most
MDS items achieved good interobserver reliability ( statis-
tic  0.6) and many--including measures of Activities of
Daily Living (ADL) function and cognition--achieved ex-
cellent reliability (10). For example, the reliability of key
indicators includes .88 for decision making, .92 for ADL
self-performance items, and .63 for behavior problems.
Only a few items had less than good reliability, although all
achieved acceptable  values (0.4). We attribute these
good results not only to the design of the instrument, but
also to its purpose: to improve care through improved care
plans. With a clinical rationale for its completion and prag-
matic directions on how to use the information gathered,
nursing home staff appear to perform accurate assessments
(11).
Measures
We analyzed 34 measures selected a priori from a range
of domains. The first domain addressed how elderly resi-
dents function in their environment and comprised indica-
tors of ADL self-performance, decision making, and short-
term memory loss. The second set addressed several aspects
of the elderly residents' adaptation to their situation, includ-
ing manifested problem behavior (verbal abuse, physical
abuse, and socially inappropriate behavior), demonstrated
mood disturbance (anxiety, depression, and no involvement
in facility activities), and the use of trunk restraints. We
added a third set of items indicating clinical conditions and
complications: falls (separately: 30 and 31­180 days
prior), weight loss (5% in 30 days or 10% in 180 days),
eating less, body mass index (used numerically), chewing
problems, swallowing problems, incontinence (bowel and
bladder), and catheter use. Finally, we considered diagnoses
reflecting prevalent diseases of an elderly population (ar-
thritis, cerebrovascular accident [CVA], cancer, diabetes,
Alzheimer's disease, other dementias, congestive heart fail-
ure, arteriosclerotic heart disease [ASHD], and hyperten-
sion). In all cases in which multiple levels were available,
we examined the presence of the most dependent level.
(Measures of the least dependent levels usually demon-
strated relationships with age that were the mirror image of
the most dependent levels, and intermediate levels were ex-
pectedly uninteresting.)
For two of the most important functional domains for
nursing home care--ADLs and cognitive performance--we
used known summary scales. The RUG-III ADL Index (12)
succinctly summarizes residents' self-performance in four
late-loss ADLs: bed mobility, bed­chair transfer, eating,
and toileting. From a range of 4 (independence in all four
ADLs) to 18 (total dependence in all four), we examined the
most impaired (i.e., values 14­18).
The MDS Cognitive Performance Scale (13) (CPS) sum-
marizes the MDS cognitive measures. Five items are com-
bined into a categorical functional scale that ranges from
"totally functional" to "very severely impaired." The CPS
corresponds closely with scores from the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and the Test for Severe Impairment.
We considered the two most severely impaired categories
(severely and very severely impaired, MMSE score  6).
The category of severely impaired CPS corresponds to the
highly impaired value of the MDS decision-making vari-
able; the latter variable was thus dropped from the analysis.
Analysis
Initial examinations of the data considered average prev-
alence of each measure in the decades 65­74, 75­84, 85­94,
and 95. For several variables, large differences were seen
in the last two periods, encouraging more detailed examina-
tion of the very oldest-old.
We computed the average prevalence of each measure at
each individual age from 80 to 105. Changes in prevalence
are similar to but not equivalent to the incidence of these
conditions, because a person could acquire but be cured of a
disease or die within the year (whether or not the death was
related to the condition). Visual examination indicated that
for younger ages (e.g., 80­90), the changes were relatively
linear; for older ages, the increases were either linear with a
larger slope or curvilinear with increasing slopes. To detect
this change in slope, we employed piecewise regression
models to examine how the prevalence of each measure
changed with age (although many other models could have
been used). For each measure, we optimized a model com-
posed of two straight lines joined to form a continuous rela-
tionship, with a change in slope at a specified breakpoint.
Similar models have been used by Chambers and Hastie
(14). The model required fitting four parameters: the inter-
cept and slope of the younger line segment (from age 80 to
the breakpoint), the slope of the older line (from the break-
point to age 106), and the breakpoint age (where the two
lines are joined). We used weights proportional to the num-
ber of nursing home residents of each age, to accommodate
for variance heterogeneity of the age-specific prevalence
percentages. However, the primary results using weighted
and nonweighted models were similar, and we report here
the unweighted results. The optimal breakpoint value was
estimated by "profiling the objective function" (15): for
M338 FRIES ET AL.
each possible breakpoint (from 85 to 100), the best piece-
wise linear model was fit (two slopes and the intercept), us-
ing least squares. Then, across the range of breakpoints, the
optimal model of this class was chosen to minimize the ob-
jective function: the sum of squared residuals. Assuming
that the two-slope model adequately represents the preva-
lence by age, we tested the hypothesis of a change in slope
at the breakpoint by comparing the residual sum of squares
for a simple linear model and for the optimal piecewise lin-
ear model, using an F test. This test likely underestimates
the hypothesis because there is also uncertainty in the esti-
mation of the breakpoint. Given this and potential concerns
about multiple comparisons, we chose a conservative threshold
for the F statistic ( p  .01). With our large samples, almost
any comparison is statistically significant, so we considered
whether contrasts were substantive rather than relying solely
on statistical comparisons.
The models generally showed adequate goodness of fit in
plotted residuals. We stress that our primary purpose was to
demonstrate that there was a marked change in the slope
around some approximate age, not that a linear model was
sufficient to describe the relationship of prevalence with
age, especially after any specific age. It may also be that a
higher order (e.g., cubic) model might be fit across the en-
tire age domain, but this would mask that the relationship
for the younger ages was close to linear and that the older ages
followed a different model. Finally, we do not suggest that the
change in slope was cataclysmic at some particular age; rather,
within some particular range of ages there was a change from
a model of linear increase to one of accelerated prevalence.
RESULTS
From 193,467 unique residents of at least age 80, we had
113,103 octogenarians, 74,209 nonagenarians, and 6,155
centenarians. Each individual age from 80 through 101 was
represented by at least 1,700 individuals, and by 990, 664,
434, and 289 individuals, respectively, for ages 102, 103,
104, and 105.
Figure 1 shows a plot typical for measures of functional
impairment, here severely impaired cognition. As expected,
the prevalence of severe impairment increases with age,
representing an average gradual decline. Prevalence in-
creases linearly from 22.6% at age 80 to mid-twenty per-
cents in the late nineties, after which there is a shift in the
annual change of prevalence, which rises to 34.6% by age
104. Fitting a piecewise model, also displayed, a slope
change was found at approximately age 97. This model has
an average increase of 0.2% per year ("younger" slope) for
ages 80­97, but 1.1% per year from 97­105 ("older" slope).
Thus, the fitted model indicates a slope change of 0.9% per
year around age 97.
Many of the measures examined demonstrated these
characteristics. Table 1 details the optimal model for each
measure. The "younger" slope (e.g., the per year change in
prevalence around age 80) for most conditions was of the
expected sign, indicating increasing prevalence of the
poorer outcomes. However, several measures had substan-
tial and statistically significant age-specific changes toward
lower prevalence of poor outcomes: depression, diabetes,
hypertension, and CVA.
Seven measures demonstrated no significant slope
changes from 80­105 years (as indicated by testing whether
the piecewise-linear model was superior to simple linear
model), including cancer, body mass index, falls 31­180
days prior, swallowing problems, and two behavior prob-
lems. For the remaining measures, we considered the mag-
nitude of the slope change. Small to moderate slope changes
were found for 18 measures, representing all the remaining
clinical conditions and complications, all but one of the di-
agnoses, the remaining two behavior problems, and trunk
restraint. Large late-life differences in the age-specific prev-
alence of conditions were seen for all measures of func-
tionality, including all the ADL measures, incontinence,
cognitive function, and a single diagnosis--arthritis. Some
measures declined slightly in people in their eighties but in-
creased in the late nineties: daily inappropriate behavior,
falls (in 30 days), weight loss, and lack of involvement in
activities. However, for most measures (including all the
measures of functionality listed earlier), the nineties pre-
saged a more substantial annual increment in prevalence.
The piecewise model also estimated the breakpoint--the
inflection point between the two linear slopes. It is impor-
tant to stress that our selection of the two-slope model was
intended to depict the change in slope and not to focus on a
particular age inflection point. Nevertheless, the break-
points indicate the general range of ages after which the pri-
mary linear model fails to fit the data. The majority of the
breakpoints are in the mid or late nineties. The six at the
lower (age 85) or upper (age 100) bounds of the search indi-
cate a relationship with slopes continually increasing or de-
creasing with age near these boundaries.
Finally, to address possible confounding with admission
status, we divided our sample into those with stays 90
days and those relatively newly admitted. The results were
virtually identical (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of many adverse conditions in the elderly
population increases every year of age after 80. Based on an
almost unprecedentedly large sample, even of centenarians,

these findings in nursing home residents extend those of
others such as Kane and Kane (16), who found that in the
general population the cross-sectional prevalence of disabil-
ity, measured in several different ways, increases with age.
However, we find that for many conditions the change in
prevalence for each increasing year of age remains rela-
tively constant until the mid-nineties, and thereafter the an-
nual changes are substantively greater. Accelerated changes
are seen for measures of how well an old person functions,
including physical or mental functioning: dysfunction in
ADL and cognitive performance (with the sole exception of
short-term memory). In contrast, all measures of adaption
(behavior, mood, and restraint use) show small or no
changes in slope, as do all clinical conditions and diagnoses
(except arthritis). When detected, changes in slope gener-
ally occur in the mid-nineties. We are not aware of other
studies detecting these changes.
Other of our results corroborate findings of other re-
searchers, such as Smith (17), that the prevalence of certain
diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and CVA, declines in
late life. We expect that this is due to selective survival:
these diseases are persistent and often directly or indirectly
linked to mortality.
Our results should be interpreted critically, as our study
has several limitations. One is the nature of the sample: our
view is restricted to the population in nursing homes. Only
2% of those aged 65­74 live in a nursing home, but this per-
centage increases to 33% for those aged 90­94 and 47% for

those aged 95 or older (18,19). Although substantial propor-
tions of persons older than 80 reside in nursing homes, and
half of those in the oldest age groups, our sample cannot be
representative of elderly persons living in the community. A
combination of medical, cognitive, and functional prob-
lems, compounded with the behavior of informal and formal
caregivers in recommending or accepting nursing home
placement, causes certain individuals to enter nursing homes.
Whether the same accelerated decline manifests itself in a
community-based elderly population can only be conjec-
tured. Second, we cannot infer causality (e.g., confirming
the effects of selective survival). Our next step will be lon-
gitudinal analysis, following individuals across time, to
measure the incidence of conditions and identify precipitat-
ing events. A third possible issue is the unknown effects of
nursing home admission practices or quality of care. Fourth,
there may also be unknown measurement effects that under-
or overreport particular diseases or conditions in the very
oldest-old. For example, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dis-
ease or dementia may not be made in the very old, as it may
be looked upon as to be expected, or the physician, family,
or resident may avoid such designation or decision on etiol-
ogy. This may be a reason for our different models for Alzhei-
mer's disease and cognitive performance. Although MDS
items have demonstrated good to excellent reliability, these
studies have not been performed particularly on the oldest-
old. Fifth, our findings may be a cohort effect rather than
age-related changes in prevalence, a concern that can be ad-
dressed when we have data across a longer period of time or
from other cultures. Sixth, we have not tested if the phe-
nomenon is limited to a subset of the very oldest-old, such
as females, or those with specific comorbidities; such analy-
sis is currently under way. Finally, there may be technical
issues with the analysis. The relationship between preva-
lence and age is unlikely to have a radical change at any
specific age but rather can be expected to follow some
higher order (and more complex) curve with a gradual ac-
celerating prevalence. We observed a linear relationship in
octogenarians and used our piecewise model to identify
where this linearity ceased. Still, the choice of our model
could bias our results and the effects of error intrinsic in the
fitting of the models and particularly in determining break-
points have not been fully evaluated.
Nevertheless, although we acknowledge these possible
problems, none provides a plausible explanation for the spe-
cific findings we focus on here--change in prevalence of
broad measures of functionality in the mid-nineties in a
large sample of institutionalized older persons. In this popu-
lation, each additional acute or subacute problem over the
years may have an accumulated effect, comparable to the
cascade-breakdown phenomenon, in which more acute
problems result in rapid terminal deterioration. The accu-
mulated effects could compromise physiological reserves
past the threshold needed for performance (20). Thus, the
human body would wear out and experience a compressed
period of change beyond the direct effects of disease.
Our results demonstrate that something different happens
to elderly persons who survive into their mid-nineties--a
more rapid rate of decline. Although this research does not
provide an etiology of this change, it is associated with
functionality rather than disease morbidity and is mani-
fested in a very large and geographically broad population
of institutionalized elderly persons. It was detected only by
the availability of extremely numerous microdata on this
population, which may only be available from large admin-
istrative data sets such as the MDS. The presence of this
phenomenon provides justification for future efforts to ex-
amine centenarians separately: indeed, there appear to be
differences between the very oldest-old and their younger
counterparts. Physicians caring for the very oldest-old
might take special care to understand functional deficits,
which at times can be reversed or managed, rather than fo-
cusing on diseases that often cannot be cured.
