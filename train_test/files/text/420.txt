Evidence of Nephropathy and
Peripheral Neuropathy in US Adults
With Undiagnosed Diabetes
ABSTRACT
PURPOSE Nearly one third of diabetes cases in the United States is undiagnosed,
with mounting evidence that complications accrue even before clinical diagnosis.
We wanted to determine whether persons with undiagnosed diabetes have signs
of nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy
METHODS We examined the prevalence of positive screening tests for nephropa-
thy and peripheral neuropathy in adults aged 40 years with undiagnosed dia-
betes using secondary analysis of survey and examination data from the popu-
lation-based United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
1999-2002. We defined a positive screening test for nephropathy as a spot urine
albumin-creatinine ratio >30.0 mg/g, representing at least microalbuminuria. We
defined 1 insensate area on Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing as a posi-
tive finding for neuropathy. Undiagnosed diabetes was defined as a combination
of no history of diagnosed diabetes and a measured fasting glucose 126 mg/dL.
We used SUDAAN for 2 and regression analyses.
RESULTS The prevalence of a positive test when screening for nephropathy
among those with undiagnosed diabetes was 26.5% compared with 7.1% in those
with no diabetes (2, P <.01). After adjusting for age and diagnosed or undiag-
nosed hypertension, the association of undiagnosed diabetes with nephropathy
persisted (odds ratio = 2.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-4.01). For periph-
eral neuropathy, 21.5% with undiagnosed diabetes had positive screening tests
compared with 10.1% with no diabetes (2, P <.01); however, this effect was not
significant after adjustment for age. There was no significant difference in positive
screening tests for nephropathy or neuropathy when comparing those with undi-
agnosed and diagnosed diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS A significant proportion of adults with undiagnosed diabetes have
signs of nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy. These findings may influence
policies about early screening for diabetes.

INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes for US adults has been esti-
mated at 2.4%, representing 4.9 million adults and nearly 30% of all
cases of diabetes in the United States in 1999-2000.1 Type 2 diabe-
tes is especially likely to be undiagnosed for years because of its insidious
clinical prodrome; projections based on extrapolation of time to develop-
ment of complications of diabetes estimate that the average time from the
onset of disease to clinical diagnosis of diabetes in the US population is as
much as 12 years.2,3 Twenty percent of persons with undiagnosed diabetes
already have developed retinopathy.2 The prevalence of other microvascu-
lar complications among US adults with undiagnosed diabetes is unknown,
although microvascular complications, including retinopathy and signs of

nephropathy and neuropathy, were found to be highly
prevalent at the time of diagnosis of diabetes in United
Kingdom and Dutch populations.4,5
Peripheral sensory neuropathy is an important com-
plication of diabetes and a major contributor to dia-
betic foot ulcers.6 In the United States in 1999-2000,
the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy, as measured
by at least 1 insensate area on monofilament testing,
has been found to be 28.5% in those aged 40 years and
older with diagnosed diabetes.7
Diabetes is the leading cause of end-stage renal
disease in the United States.8,9 The prevalence of one
of the earliest signs of nephropathy, microalbuminuria,
in the United States among persons with diagnosed
diabetes has been estimated at 28.1%, with 6.1% exhib-
iting macroalbuminuria.10
Using a population-based sample, we describe the
population prevalence of positive screening tests for 2
microvascular complications of diabetes, nephropathy
and peripheral neuropathy, among adults aged 40 years
and older with undiagnosed diabetes in the United
States in 1999-2002. This knowledge will broaden our
understanding of the early complications of diabetes
that are present even before clinical diagnosis.
METHODS
Data Source
The most recent National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES), a product of the National
Center for Health Statistics, spans the years 1999-2002
and includes a household interview, dietary interview,
physician examination, and laboratory and diagnostic
testing at a Mobile Examination Center. The NHANES
1999-2002 uses a stratified, multistage probability
sample, allowing estimation of disease prevalence in the
civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. We sampled
adults 40 years of age and older for this analysis because
this population in the NHANES had both monofilament
and urine testing. We also used the subsample of par-
ticipants who had fasting plasma glucose measurements,
resulting in an unweighted sample size of 2,571. For
the analysis of peripheral neuropathy, our sample size is
slightly smaller because not all adults had monofilament
testing. Additionally, because participants who reported
a history of stroke (n = 103) were excluded from the neu-
ropathy sample, as stroke might confound the assessment
of peripheral sensation, the resulting final sample size
was 2,337. The Institutional Review Board of the Medical
University of South Carolina approved this research.
Nephropathy: Urinary Albumin-Creatinine Ratio
Both urine albumin and urine creatinine were mea-
sured in NHANES 1999-2002 adult participants using
a Jaffe rate reaction for creatinine analysis and solid-
phase fluorescent immunoassay for albumin analysis.11
The spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio is recom-
mended by the American Diabetes Association to
screen for diabetic nephropathy and is less susceptible
to false negatives and false positives than is spot urine
albumin testing without concomitant urine creatinine
measurement.12,13 A spot urine albumin-creatinine ratio
30 mg/g is defined as abnormal, representing at least
microalbuminuria.13,14
Peripheral Neuropathy: Insensate Area on
5.07 Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Testing
Loss of protective sensation was ascertained by a
standard monofilament test for NHANES participants
aged 40 years and older.15 Slight pressure with a 5.07
Semmes-Weinstein monofilament was applied 3 times
to each of 3 areas on each foot (hallux and first and
fifth metatarsal heads). The testing used a 2-alternative
forced-choice algorithm.16 Insensitivity at any site on
more than 1 occasion constitutes a positive screening
test for peripheral neuropathy. Further details of the
NHANES testing procedure are available.17 Positive
5.07 Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing in per-
sons with diabetes has been shown to be predictive of
future diabetic foot ulceration, and it has been used
previously to estimate the prevalence of peripheral
neuropathy in populations.7,18,19
Diagnosed Diabetes, Undiagnosed Diabetes,
No Diabetes
The NHANES assessed participants for diagnosed
diabetes using the question, "Other than during preg-
nancy, have you ever been told by a doctor or health
professional that you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?"
We defined participants as having diagnosed diabetes
if they answered "yes" to this question. We defined
participants as having undiagnosed diabetes if they
answered "no" to this question and had a fasting plasma
glucose of 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). We defined par-
ticipants as having no diabetes if they did not have lab-
oratory evidence consistent with diabetes and denied a
history of diagnosed diabetes. This method of classify-
ing NHANES participants as having diagnosed, undi-
agnosed, and no diabetes has been used previously.1
As a check on the validity of the classification of
undiagnosed diabetes, we examined the medication lists
of the NHANES participants whom we defined as hav-
ing no diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes for evidence
of use of medicines classified according to the US Food
and Drug Administration's National Drug Code Direc-
tory (NDC).20 Participants were reclassified as having
diagnosed diabetes if they reported being on a medicine
in NDC drug class code 1036, "blood glucose regula-

tors," which accounted for 0.5% of the total sample of
those initially classified as having undiagnosed diabetes.
We investigated demographic characteristics of the
population with diagnosed, undiagnosed, and no diabe-
tes, including age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Race/ethnic-
ity is self-defined by NHANES participants according
to the following classifications: non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other. We also inves-
tigated the health care access factors of lack of health
insurance, absence of a regular place of care, and lack of
any health care utilization during the past year, as well
as the socioeconomic factors of low income, defined as
less than $20,000 for the household for the year, high
school education (less than, more than, or equivalent),
and marital status. Health insurance was assessed only
for those aged less than 65 years, as health care cover-
age in the United States for those aged 65 years and up
is nearly universal as a result of the Medicare program.
We examined the participants' body mass index (BMI)
and self-rated health status, which had the possible val-
ues of excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor.
Additionally we examined the prevalence of diag-
nosed and undiagnosed hypertension in the sample,
because there is a potential confounding effect of
hypertension on the relationship between diabetes
and nephropathy/microalbuminuria. Participants were
classified as having diagnosed hypertension if they
answered "yes" to the NHANES survey question,
"Have you ever been told by a doctor or other health
professional that you had hypertension, also called
high blood pressure?" In a manner similar to defining
participants with undiagnosed diabetes, we defined
individuals as having undiagnosed hypertension if
they answered "no" to this question about diagnosed
hypertension and if they had either a measured systolic
blood pressure 140 mm Hg or a measured diastolic
blood pressure 90 mm Hg. Blood pressure in the
NHANES survey was the average of 3 to 4 blood
pressures measured with a mercury sphygmomanom-
eter according to the American Heart Association
recommended procedures.21 Finally, we examined the
medication lists of the NHANES participants whom
we defined as having no evidence of hypertension or
undiagnosed hypertension for evidence of medicines
classified according to the US Food and Drug Admin-
istration's NDC.20 Participants were reclassified as
having diagnosed hypertension if they reported being
on a medicine in NDC drug class codes 0506 "anti-
hypertensives," 0507 "diuretics," 0510 "calcium channel
blockers," 0512 "beta blockers," 0513 "alpha agonist/
alpha blockers," and 0514 "ace inhibitors." NHANES
interviewers also ascertained the main reason for the
use of the medication, further validating the classifica-
tion of each medication as an antihypertensive.
Analysis
We applied appropriate sample weights to the
unweighted samples to calculate population estimates
of those with a positive screening test according to
their diabetes diagnosis status. We used sample weights
for the subpopulation with fasting glucose measure-
ments and the combined sample weights for the 1999-
2000 and 2001-2002 data releases, as recommended
for NHANES analysis.22 We compared rates of a posi-
tive screening test for nephropathy and for peripheral
neuropathy in those with no evidence of diabetes,
undiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes using a
2 test with SUDAAN statistical software for this clus-
tered and weighted probability sample.23
Because hypertension and undiagnosed hyperten-
sion are common in persons with diagnosed and undi-
agnosed diabetes in this sample, it is possible that the
presence of hypertension might confound the effect of
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes on microalbumin-
uria.5 Additionally, age is related to both the outcomes
of nephropathy and neuropathy.7 We therefore used
logistic regression to examine the effect of undiag-
nosed diabetes on the presence of microalbuminuria
after adjustment for age and hypertension, comprising
both diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertension. We
also used logistic regression to examine the effect of
undiagnosed diabetes on a positive screening test for
peripheral neuropathy after adjustment for age.
RESULTS
The sociodemographic and health care access charac-
teristics of those aged 40 years and older with undiag-
nosed diabetes in the United States in 1999-2002, as
opposed to those with diagnosed diabetes and no evi-
dence of diabetes, are displayed in Table 1. There were
399 people in the unweighted sample with an elevated
urine albumin-creatinine ratio and 332 people in the
unweighted sample with at least 1 area of insensitivity
on either foot and no history of stroke.
The prevalence of positive screening tests for
nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy among US
adults aged 40 years and older with no evidence of
diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, and diagnosed diabetes
is represented in Table 2. When compared only with
those with no evidence diabetes, those who had undi-
agnosed diabetes had significantly more nephropathy,
P <.01 (2); when compared with those who had diag-
nosed diabetes, there was no significant difference,
P = .63 (2). Similarly, a significantly greater proportion
of persons with undiagnosed diabetes had a positive
screening test for peripheral neuropathy than did those
with no evidence of diabetes, P = .04 (2), whereas
there was no significant difference between the groups

NEUROPATHY AND UNDIAGNOSED DIABETES
with undiagnosed and previously diagnosed diabetes,
P = .72 (2). In an analysis of positive screening tests
for peripheral neuropathy, including those with stroke,
a similar pattern was found, with significantly more
screening tests positive for peripheral neuropathy in
those with undiagnosed diabetes than in those with no
evidence of diabetes, P = .02 (2), whereas there was
no significant difference in positive screening tests for
peripheral neuropathy between the groups with undi-
agnosed and previously diagnosed diabetes.
In a logistic regression model examining the rela-
tive contributions of diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes,
age, and any hypertension to the pres-
ence of microalbuminuria, the effect of
both undiagnosed diabetes (odds ratio
[OR] = 2.35; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.38-4.01) and diagnosed diabetes
(OR = 3.01; 95% CI, 1.99-4.57) per-
sisted even after adjustment for age and
diagnosed or undiagnosed hypertension.
In a logistic regression model examin-
ing the contributions of diabetes and
undiagnosed diabetes to the presence of
a positive screening test for peripheral
neuropathy, with adjustment for age,
diagnosed diabetes was a significant pre-
dictor (OR = 1.72; 95% CI, 1.01-2.91);
however, undiagnosed diabetes was not
(OR = 1.90; 95% CI, 0.91-3.96).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first examination of the
prevalence of positive screening tests for
nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy
among those who had undiagnosed dia-
betes in a US population-based sample.
That 24.9% of adults 40 years and older
with undiagnosed diabetes had signs
of nephropathy and 21.5% had signs of
peripheral neuropathy adds to the accu-
mulating literature which documents
undiagnosed diabetes is not a benign
condition but represents a serious pub-
lic health concern. Rates of positive
screening tests for these 2 diabetes com-
plications in those with undiagnosed
diabetes were both significantly higher
than in the nondiabetic population, but
these rates were not significantly differ-
ent from those with diagnosed diabetes.
Additionally, the effect of undiagnosed
diabetes on the presence of microal-
buminuria persisted after adjustment
for age and diagnosed or undiagnosed
hypertension.
These findings, along with estimates
of the prevalence of complications at
the time of diagnosis, suggest the time
before diagnosis of diabetes is neither

benign nor quiescent.4,5,24 The time from disease onset
to clinical diagnosis has been estimated to be at least 9
to 12 years.2,3 Furthermore, onset of type 2 diabetes is
often insidious, with a prodrome of subclinical disease
that may last more than 10 years and involves insu-
lin resistance and other metabolic abnormalities.25-27
Insulin resistance in the absence of diabetes has been
shown to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease,
prolonging the period of potential risk for complica-
tions.28,29 In fact, increased prevalence of microalbu-
minuria and sensory neuropathy is found in those with
impaired glucose tolerance.30,31
The population estimates for a positive screening
test for peripheral neuropathy among persons with
diagnosed diabetes in this study are lower than in past
published inquiries.7 Several reasons account for this
difference. First, we excluded participants with stroke.
Second, we reclassified persons with no evidence
of diabetes or with undiagnosed diabetes who were
using diabetes medications. Third, we were using a
larger data set that includes not only the 1999-2000
NHANES survey but also the more recent data from
the 2001-2002 NHANES survey; the inclusion of these
additional data may in itself lead to slight differences
in prevalence estimates. Lastly, our investigation used
fasting plasma glucose values to define and contrast
those with undiagnosed diabetes, which led us to use
a morning fasting subsample of NHANES participants
and the associated morning subsample weights to reach
our population estimates. Similarly, the population esti-
mates of microalbuminuria differ from previous studies
for many of the same reasons, including the limitation
of our sample to adults aged 40 years and older.10
One strength of this study is its ability to produce
population estimates for undiagnosed diabetes and
its coexisting complications for the US population of
adults aged 40 years and older. Only through using the
NHANES data set, which simultaneously assesses a
history of diabetes with laboratory evidence for diabe-
tes, can we arrive at estimates of undiagnosed diabetes.
In this way, we can, in effect, know what is unknown.
We were also able to examine some of the sociodemo-
graphic and health care access factors associated with
undiagnosed diabetes.
A few limitations must be acknowledged. Because
our study is a cross-sectional examination, inferences
about sociodemographic health care access charac-
teristics among those with undiagnosed diabetes is
limited in that cause and effect can not be determined.
For example, those with undiagnosed diabetes were
less likely to have health insurance than those with
previously diagnosed diabetes. Even so, we cannot
say whether the lack of insurance resulted in the lack
of diagnosis of diabetes or whether, conversely, those
with diagnosed diabetes were more likely to subse-
quently obtain health insurance.
Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing is a screen-
ing test for peripheral neuropathy and does not con-
stitute a definitive diagnosis of neuropathy, although it
certainly has documented clinical utility.32 Additionally,
although it may not be as accurate as nerve conduction
studies, monofilament testing has utility for estimates
of disease in large epidemiologic samples such as the
NHANES, it has been used similarly in previous stud-
ies, and it is recommended by the ADA for assessment
of the foot in all patients with diabetes who are not
already known to have neuropathy.7,12 We excluded
persons with stroke, but there may be other causes of
decreased peripheral sensation that we were not able
to address which may affect the prevalence of a posi-
tive screening test, particularly among those with no
evidence of diabetes. We did not investigate metabolic
causes of peripheral neuropathy other than diabetes
because of the limitations of using existing data.
Mass population screening for diabetes is not rec-
ommended at this time33-35 despite evidence that early
treatment can prevent complications.36 Although the
results presented here do not lead us to advocate mass
screening, they do sensitize us to the point that the cur-
rent approach of detecting diabetes once clinical signs
and symptoms are apparent may be too late to prevent
complications and may be a strategy in need of review.
The evidence presented in this study is consistent with
similar evidence for retinopathy,2 which suggests that
those with undetected diabetes are already beginning
to accrue complications of diabetes. This new knowl-
edge about the prevalence of positive screening tests
for nephropathy and peripheral neuropathy in those
with undiagnosed diabetes may have implications for
policy and research initiatives regarding screening and
detection of diabetes, as well as efforts to prevent dia-
betes. We have effective, inexpensive, and minimally
invasive tests to detect both diabetes and prediabetic
states. More aggressive use of screening based on risk
stratification for diabetes is in order and should be
appropriately reimbursed. Research that focuses on risk
stratification may lead to more cost-effective screening
strategies. Additional evidence of early complications
and investigation into the effects of early detection
and treatment of diabetes may further inform decisions
about policies to screen based on risk.
