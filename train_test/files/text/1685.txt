Abstract
Background: The 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is used to describe an
accelerometer-derived physical activity/inactivity profile in normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2), overweight (25  BMI
< 30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI  30 kg/m2) U.S. adults.
Methods: We computed physical activity volume indicators (activity counts/day, uncensored and censored steps/
day), rate indicators (e.g., steps/minute), time indicators (employing NHANES activity counts/minute cut points to
infer time in non-wear, sedentary, low, light, moderate, and vigorous intensities), the number of breaks in sedentary
time (occasions when activity counts rose from < 100 activity/counts in one minute to  100 activity counts in the
subsequent minute), achievement of public health guidelines, and classification by step-defined physical activity
levels. Data were examined for evidence of consistent and significant gradients across BMI-defined categories.
Results: In 2005-2006, U.S adults averaged 6,564 ± SE 107 censored steps/day, and after considering non-wear
time, they spent approximately 56.8% of the rest of the waking day in sedentary time, 23.7% in low intensity,
16.7% in light intensity, 2.6% in moderate intensity, and 0.2% in vigorous intensity. Overall, approximately 3.2% of
U.S. adults achieved public health guidelines. The normal weight category took 7,190 ± SE 157 steps/day, and
spent 25.7 ± 0.9 minutes/day in moderate intensity and 7.3 ± 0.4 minutes/day in vigorous intensity physical
activity. The corresponding numbers for the overweight category were 6,879 ± 140 steps/day, 25.3 ± 0.9 minutes/
day, and 5.3 ± 0.5 minutes/day and for the obese category 5,784 ± 124 steps/day, 17.3 ± 0.7 minutes/day and
3.2 ± 0.4 minutes/day. Across BMI categories, increasing gradients and significant trends were apparent in males for
sedentary time and decreasing gradients and significant trends were evident in time spent in light intensity,
moderate intensity, and vigorous intensity. For females, there were only consistent gradients and significant trends
apparent for decreasing amounts of time spent in moderate and vigorous intensity.
Conclusions: Simple indicators of physical activity volume (i.e., steps/day) and time in light, moderate or vigorous
intensity physical activity differ across BMI categories for both sexes, suggesting that these should continue to be
targets for surveillance.
Background
The 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) data indicate that more than
one-third of U.S. adults are obese (BMI  30 kg/m2),
including 33.3% of men and 35.3% of women [1]. A
potential contributor to this state of affairs is reduced
physical activity. However, self-reported participation in
leisure-time physical activity has remained relatively
stable over time [2] and more recently (between 2001
and 2005) appears to have increased slightly [3].
Although it is easy to conclude that this apparent para-
dox points solely to dietary overconsumption as the
driving force behind the obesity epidemic [4], it may
also be explained by the fact that gains in leisure-time
physical activity might not compensate sufficiently for
the diminishing alternative opportunities for expending
energy. Specifically, there has been a noticeable secular
transition in work-related physical activity demands

(moving increasingly from physical labor to sedentary
occupations) [5], domestic mechanization through
labor-saving devices [6], short-distance transportation
modes and patterns (moving increasingly to motorized
travel from non-motorized travel), and a persistent pre-
dilection for passive recreational pursuits (including sus-
tained record levels of television viewing behaviors,
despite competition from other electronic media [7]).
Most experts agree that technological advances have
reduced lifestyle activity,[8-10] however, there are pre-
cious few direct data to support this. Perhaps the best
example is a study of Old Order Amish who reject
motorized technologies and practice a traditional life-
style of `living off the land'[11]. Men from this group
take approximately 18,000 steps/day and women take
14,000 pedometer-determined steps/day. This is in stark
contrast to data collected in two U.S. pedometer-based
samples: Colorado (6,800 steps/day)[12] and South
Carolina ( 5,900 steps/day)[13]. Since the discrepancy
between these Amish (reflective of an earlier pre-
technology time) and more contemporary values ranges
between 7,000 to 12,000 steps/day, it is likely that the
erosion of daily steps began earlier in the past century,
but it is only as these transitions have proliferated and
compounded, reaching a "tipping point" in the 1980s in
the USA, that we have been able to trace obvious indi-
cators of the increasing obesity epidemic. Developing
nations are now experiencing a similar process [14].
Considering these diverse behavioral suspects, it is
necessary to capture a full range of physical activity/
inactivity estimates concurrently in normal weight, over-
weight, and obese individuals if we are to better estab-
lish a comprehensive physical activity profile [15]
associated with obesity. The concept of physical activity
profiling (e.g., examining a complete panel of physical
activity/inactivity indicators simultaneously) attempts to
move beyond single point estimates of time spent only
in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), for
example [15,16]. Physical activity profiling is an essential
first step to teasing out which aspects of a full physical
activity spectrum may most likely be contributing to the
growing obesity problem and can also point the way to
a minimal data set necessary for surveillance purposes.
Objective monitoring by accelerometry produces a
wealth of information that can be distilled and examined
to better understand the complex nature of a full range
of human physical activity/inactivity behaviors. For
example, NHANES now uses accelerometers to objec-
tively capture free-living physical activity behaviors as
part of its surveillance system. The accelerometer used
(Actigraph AM-7164) produces raw outputs of minute-
by-minute steps (depicting a movement event; released
for the first time in the 2005-2006 NHANES) and activ-
ity counts (denoting acceleration of movement in
addition to its occurrence; available since the 2003-2004
NHANES). These raw activity counts can be trans-
formed to produce a number of indicators of physical
activity/inactivity. For example, since the ActiGraph
data are time-stamped, it is possible to derive duration
spent in different intensities of activity (including seden-
tary time) using activity counts/minute cut points (e.g.,
those established for the NHANES data) [17]. The
2003-2004 NHANES accelerometer data have been used
to identify prevalence of achieving minimal public health
guidelines (based on intensity bouts and their duration)
[17]. The same data were used to analyze time in seden-
tary behaviors, defined as time spent < 100 activity
counts/minute [18]. We have recently used the 2005-
2006 data to provide population and sex-specific epide-
miology of accelerometer-determined steps/day with
and without censoring steps detected at very low inten-
sity [19]. Accelerometer data can also be manipulated to
express physical activity as a summed volume of activity
counts engaged in over the course of the day or as a
rate (either activity counts/minute or steps/minute) con-
sidering time worn [20]. Recently, Healy et al. [21] have
demonstrated that breaks in sedentary time transitions
(e.g., moving from sitting to standing) can be counted
using ActiGraph data and may be associated with meta-
bolic risk.
The opportunity at hand is to describe a comprehen-
sive accelerometer-derived physical activity/inactivity
profile in body mass index (BMI) defined normal weight,
overweight, and obese men and women using the 2005-
2006 NHANES data. Although BMI has recognized lim-
itations as an indicator of body fatness/obesity (e.g., it
overestimates body fat in muscular individuals and can
underestimate body fat in those who have lost muscle
mass), it is a favoured measure of excess weight in epide-
miological studies focused on relative risk of disease [22].
Methods
NHANES 2005-2006
NHANES began in the early 1960s as a periodic health
survey and became continuously implemented since
1999. Approximately 5,000 people engage in interviews
and physical examinations each year and the data are
released in two-year intervals. The physical activity
monitor component was added to NHANES in 2003 to
objectively assess participants  6 years of age. The
2005-2006 survey marks the first release of acceler-
ometer-determined step data in addition to the more
commonly evaluated output of time-stamped activity
counts/minute, making it the most inclusive ActiGraph
data set available on a large surveillance study (nation-
ally representative of the U.S.).
NHANES contains data from individuals selected
under a complex, multistage probability design to be

representative of the civilian, non-institutionalized U.S.
population. Households are identified, interviews are
conducted in the home, and participants are subse-
quently invited to a mobile examination center to
receive a health examination. Participants with no walk-
ing impairments (or other limitations that prevent
wearing an accelerometer) are invited to wear the accel-
erometer and instructed in its standard use. The device,
programmed to record information each minute, is
worn on the right hip using an elasticized fabric belt.
Standardized instructions include wearing the acceler-
ometer during waking hours for 7 days and only remov-
ing it for water activities such as swimming, showering,
and bathing. Accelerometers are returned to the
NHANES data center by pre-paid mail and participants
are compensated $40.
The 2005-2006 data file of minute-by-minute activity
count and step data was made publically available at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm in June, 2008. The
data set was prepared for release by NHANES staff who
reviewed it for unreasonable values, for example, occur-
rences of zero steps and > 250 activity counts/minute
(Captain Richard P. Troiano, personal communication)
and whether or not instruments remained calibrated
upon their return. Reliable data are clearly indicated for
ready use. The National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) Ethics Review Board approved the original sur-
vey protocols, and informed consent was obtained for
all NHANES participants. The Pennington Biomedical
Research Center's Institutional Review Board approved
of this analysis.
Data Treatment
Accelerometer time worn (hours and minutes) was com-
puted using a specifically designed SAS macro provided
by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at http://riskfac-
tor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/. This macro infers
non-wear from at least 60 contiguous minutes of zero
activity count data points. This decision rule results in a
more comprehensive data set when compared to 20
minutes, for example [23].
This analysis was focused on adult participants  20
years of age. Of the 4,372 eligible men and women in
the sample, we excluded 171 with NHANES-designated
unreliable data and 185 with accelerometers determined
not to be in calibration upon return. Since this analysis
focused on BMI-defined weight categories, we excluded
269 women who self-reported pregnancy and a single
individual with a BMI > 100 kg/m2. We also excluded
224 individuals who did not have at least one valid day
of wear (defined as  10 hours of wear [17-19]), in keep-
ing with previous analyses [18,19]. A more thorough dis-
cussion of the appropriateness of using a single day of
wear is available elsewhere [19]. Ultimately, this analysis
is based on 3,522 individuals or 81% of the originally
eligible sample. We did not present a summary of our
results on accelerometer data for men and women with
a  18.5 kg/m2 (technically considered underweight)
because such data were available only for 69 adults, a
sample size we feel is too small for informative
interpretation.
Table 1 summarizes the panel of indicator variables
comprising a comprehensive accelerometer-derived phy-
sical activity/inactivity profile of U.S. men and women.
All indicator variables have been previously defined and
used in the literature; we did not create anything new
for this specific analysis. Physical activity volume indica-
tors included daily totals of activity count and step data
averaged over the number of days worn to produce
activity counts/day and steps/day, respectively. Following
previously published methods [19], steps/day were
further transformed after censoring out those steps
taken at an intensity < 500 activity counts/minute
(equivalent to low intensity and sedentary behaviors,
defined further below). Since the ActiGraph is known to
be more sensitive to low force movements than accepted
research quality pedometers, leading to relatively higher
step estimates [20,24,25], this censoring manipulation
was necessary to bring the accelerometer-determined
steps/day more in line with current pedometer-based
scales [26] and comparable surveillance studies
[12,13,27]. The process only affects step data. Time in
intensity derived from the activity count data is unaf-
fected. In this analysis we present both uncensored (i.e.,
raw) and censored steps/day.
Physical activity rate indicators included activity
counts/minute, uncensored steps/minute, and censored
steps/minute, each computed considering time worn.
Each of the daily 1,440 minutes recorded for each indi-
vidual were categorized by intensity according to specific
activity counts/minute values that have been previously
used to analyze NHANES data [17] to produce a series
of time indicators. In particular, 2,020 activity counts/
minute is considered the threshold value indicative of
moderate intensity activity and 5,999 activity counts/
minute stands for minimally vigorous intensity activities.
Time spent at < 100 activity counts/minute (after
removing non-wear time was identified as engaging in
sedentary behaviors [18]. Non-wear time (which logically
includes sleep time) represents the difference between
1,440 minutes and wear time (that is, wear time is cal-
culated by subtracting macro-determined non-wear time
from 1,440). Time spent at < 2,020 activity counts/
minute) was further segmented into low (100-499 activ-
ity counts/minute) and light (500-2,019 activity counts/
minute) intensity activities consistent with previous ana-
lyses that have looked at finer gradations of intensity
categories simultaneously [20]. In that previous study,

activity counts/minute < 500 were originally labeled
"inactive" intensity; for clarity and consistency we have
chosen to re-label it here "low" intensity. Daily minutes
in each intensity category were summed. Total daily
minutes within intensity categories were summed and
subsequently divided by the number of days worn to
compute daily average time spent in non-wear, seden-
tary behaviors, and low, light, moderate, and vigorous
intensity activities.
We accessed another NCI-supplied SAS macro (located
at http://riskfactor.cancer.gov/tools/nhanes_pam/) to
determine achievement of public health guidelines to
accumulate 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity in
modified 10-minute bouts on at least 5 of 7 days using a
Bayesian approach to interpret information from all indi-
viduals with one or more valid days [17]. A modified
10-minute bout was defined as 10 or more consecutive
minutes above the moderate intensity activity count
threshold, with allowance for interruptions of 1 or 2
minutes below threshold. In keeping with previous ana-
lyses, a bout was terminated by 3 minutes below thresh-
old [17].
The number of transitions or breaks in sedentary time
were counted as occasions when activity counts rose
from < 100 activity/counts in one minute to  100 activ-
ity counts in the subsequent minute [21]. These were
totalled on a daily basis and averaged over the number
of days worn. Finally, we computed the percent of the
sample classified using an established step-defined
physical activity scale [26,28]: 1) < 5,000 steps/day
(sedentary); 2) 5,000-7,499 steps/day (low active); 3)
7,500-9,999 steps/day (somewhat active); 4) 10,000-
12,499 steps/day (active); and 5)  12,500 steps/day
(highly active). We have previously also segmented the
pedometer-defined sedentary level into < 2,500 steps/
day (basally active) and 2,500 to 4,999 steps/day (limited
activity) [19] and the complete set of step-defined
physical activity levels are used herein. These categories

reflect the use of research quality pedometers, highlight-
ing the need to align the NHANES accelerometer-deter-
mined steps data accordingly. Therefore, we used the
censored steps/day data for these classifications.
Descriptive statistics (means or frequencies and 95%
CIs where appropriate) were calculated for each of the
physical activity/inactivity variables and presented by
normal weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2), overweight (25  BMI
< 30 kg/m2), and obese (BMI  30 kg/m2) categories for
the total sample and by sex. Data were examined for
evidence of consistent gradients across BMI categories
(consistent increasing or decreasing pattern vs. a ran-
domly fluctuating pattern) and statistical tests were con-
ducted to evaluate significant trends, also across BMI
categories.
Results
Table 2 summarizes the accelerometer-derived volume,
rate, and break in sedentary time indicators for 2005-
2006 NHANES U.S. adults. All volume and rate indica-
tors show a clear and significant decreasing gradient
across BMI categories, and they were also consistently
higher for males compared to those for females. The dif-
ference in breaks in sedentary time across BMI cate-
gories appears to be minimal (a difference of only 1-2
breaks per day) but does show a similar gradient, how-
ever this was only statistically significant in the males.
Across BMI categories, however, females consistently
took relatively more breaks in sedentary time compared
to males.
Figure 1 displays the percent achieving public health
guidelines by BMI category and sex. Overall, achieve-
ment of public health guidelines is relatively uncommon
(i.e., < 5%). Still, a decreasing gradient is apparent across
BMI categories and also between sexes (males >
females).
Figure 2 is a bubble graph that displays daily time
spent in each of the time indicators across sex-specific
BMI-defined normal weight/overweight/obesity cate-
gories. The size and height of the bubble represents the
number of minutes/day. Across BMI categories and
between sexes the greatest minutes/day were spent, in
descending rank order, in non-wear time, sedentary
time, low intensity, light intensity, moderate intensity,
and vigorous intensity. Although there was no apparent
gradient in non-wear time across BMI categories in
males, the trend was significant and most obvious for
obese males. Time spent in low intensity activities
showed no gradient across BMI categories in males, and
there was no significant trend. Increasing gradients and
significant trends were apparent in males for sedentary
time and decreasing gradients and significant trends
were evident in time spent in light intensity, moderate
intensity, and vigorous intensity. For females, there were
only consistent gradients and significant trends apparent
for decreasing amounts of time spent in moderate and
vigorous intensity. No other time indicators were signifi-
cant in females across BMI categories. Within BMI cate-
gories, males (compared with females) consistently spent
less time in non-wear time and in low intensity time
and more time in light intensity and moderate intensity
across BMI categories. No other differences were
consistent.
Figures 3 (males) and 4 (females) present percents
classified by step-defined activity levels. Considering
both sexes together, there were relatively more over-
weight and obese individuals classified as taking basal
activity and limited activity. This pattern was reversed in
those classified as low active, active, and high active. An
exception to these patterns was evident in those classi-
fied as somewhat active; relatively more overweight indi-
viduals were classified as such compared to either
normal weight or obese individuals. By sex, there were
relatively more males classified in the somewhat active,
active, and highly active categories whereas relatively
more females were classified in the basal activity, limited
activity, and low active categories.
Discussion
This analysis presents the most comprehensive set of
accelerometer-derived indicators of physical activity/
inactivity using the largest nationally representative data
set yet available. As a nation (excepting pregnant
women), U.S adults average 6,564 ± SE 107 censored
steps/day, and after considering non-wear time, they
spend approximately 56.8% of the rest of the waking day
in sedentary time, 23.7% in low intensity, 16.7% in light
intensity, 2.6% in moderate intensity, and 0.2% in vigor-
ous intensity. Overall, approximately 3.2% of U.S. adults
achieve public health guidelines.
Examined across BMI categories for both sexes, a con-
sistent decreasing and statistically significant gradient is
apparent for all physical activity volume indicators, as is
expected. With regards to time indicators (i.e., measured
time spent in various intensity categories), there was a
clear moderating effect of sex. Significant gradients were
observed for non-wear time, sedentary time, light time,
moderate time, and vigorous time (but not low intensity
time) in males. For females, only gradients in moderate
and vigorous intensity time were significant. Further,
despite the fact that achievement of public health guide-
lines, is, overall, a rare phenomenon (at least as mea-
sured by the ActiGraph accelerometer), a decreasing
gradient was still evident across BMI categories. Strath
et al. [16] have also reported a relationship between
time in MVPA and markers of obesity in U.S. adults
using the 2003-2004 NHANES data. As this is a cross-
sectional analysis, we are not able to conclude whether

these decreased physical activity indicators lead to over-
weight and obesity or whether weight gain reduces these
physical activity indicators. Other evidence suggests that
both mechanisms are at work on an individual level
[29,30]. Body weight status is a complex function of
other contributors, including dietary intake, although
this is not a focus of this analysis.
The observed gradient in breaks in sedentary time was
minimal (a difference of 1-2 breaks/day across BMI
categories) and only statistically significant in males.
Therefore, although these are only cross-sectional data,
these minimal differences would suggest that this speci-
fic aspect of sedentary behavior may not be an impor-
tant contributor to the obesity epidemic [31] (but this
does not negate a possible contribution to other impor-
tant health-related outcomes). Previous reports linking
sedentary behavior to obesity have used questionnaire
methods to recall sitting time [32,33], but also the same
brand and model of accelerometer as used by NHANES
[21,34]. We also used the same definitions of sedentary
time [34] and breaks in sedentary time [21] as these pre-
vious accelerometer-based reports so the very minimal
differences we observed cannot be explained by differ-
ences in either instrumentation or cut point choices.
We observed a similar decreasing gradient across BMI
categories in rate indicators, however, these are ratios
and as such need to be interpreted cautiously since they
are affected simultaneously by both the numerator and
the denominator (in this case, time monitored by accel-
erometer). Although we observed no consistent differ-
ences in non-wear time across BMI categories, variation
in either the physical activity volume indicator or time
that the accelerometer was worn, or both, can distort
conclusions. That being said, a post-hoc analysis of cov-
ariance was performed to adjust mean time spent in
each intensity for wear time. The results of this analysis
were very similar to the unadjusted results. For example,
when examining time spent in the sedentary intensity
for males, the trend across BMI categories stayed signifi-
cant with a p-value of 0.0001 compared to the unad-
justed p-value of 0.007. Furthermore, the analysis for
time spent in the low intensity produced a p-value of
0.64 when adjusted for wear time and a p-value of 0.78
when not adjusted. All categories were examined and
were found to produce the same conclusions as the
unadjusted model.
Activity counts corresponding to a MET-defined mod-
erate intensity physical activity appear to be much lower
in older and overweight/obese populations. Specifically,
Lopes et al. [35] conducted an ActiGraph calibration
study and determined that 1,240 activity counts/minute
represented the threshold for moderate intensity activity
in such a population, a value that is less than what has
been conventionally used to describe the same intensity
behavior in this and other NHANES analyses (i.e., 2020
activity counts/minute) [17]. Physical activity is a beha-
vior and it is quantified herein objectively as steps taken
or time above a specific activity count threshold; this
threshold captures movement as acceleration. Although
conclusions about the metabolic cost of this behavior
appear to be affected by factors known to influence
energy expenditure (e.g., body mass), we remain none-
theless confident that differences (or lack of differences)
between BMI-defined weight categories in objectively-
monitored steps taken or their acceleration are real. To
emphasize, energy expenditure is higher in obese indivi-
duals due to their higher body mass [36]. In terms of
physical activity, however, we found that obese

individuals (regardless of sex) take fewer steps/day and
spend less time in moderate and vigorous intensity
activity.
It was not surprising that overweight and obese indivi-
duals tended to take fewer steps/day and that normal
weight people tended to take more steps/day. As is evi-
dent from Figures 3 and 4, within each step-defined
activity group, the percent of normal weight, overweight,
and obese must add up to 100%; along the physical
activity continuum the normal/overweigh/obese gradient
"switches" from an upwardly sloping gradient to a
downwardly sloping gradient. However, we did not
expect to find that more overweight individuals were
classified as somewhat active (i.e., taking 7,500-10,000
steps/day) compared to both normal weight and obese
individuals. It is plausible that overweight individuals
were more likely to modify their physical activity to
affect their weight, and then this collective behavior was
picked up as a distortion to the expected gradient. A
previous analysis of 1-year tracking of pedometer-
determined physical activity showed that the percent of
obese individuals who increased their physical activity
over the previous year was higher than those who
decreased their behavior; further, as a group the obese
were less stable (that is, more change occurred) in their
behavior compared to a normal weight group [37]. The
relative instability of physical activity behavior by BMI
category requires more research for confirmation.
In keeping with surveillance of reported leisure time
physical activity [3] and inactivity [38] that show sex-
specific differences, NHANES males were consistently
more physically active (i.e., physical activity volume
and rate indicators were higher and they spent more
time in light and moderate intensity activity) and less
physically inactive (i.e., they spent less time in non-
wear time and low intensity time) than females across
BMI categories. A consistent pattern in sedentary time
was not evident between sexes across BMI categories.
However, across these same categories, females took
relatively more breaks in sedentary time compared to
males. There were also relatively more males classified
in the somewhat active, active, and highly active

step-defined categories whereas relatively more females
were classified in the basal activity, limited activity and
low active categories. No other patterns (i.e., consistent
results between sexes across BMI categories) were
apparent.
Acknowledging the limitations of cross-sectional ana-
lysis, by scrutinizing a full panel of concurrent estimates
of physical activity/inactivity across BMI-defined weight
categories, we can begin to identify specific activity
parameters that maximally differentiate between nor-
mal/overweight/obese samples and therefore best inform
on-going surveillance efforts and physical activity inter-
ventions. An important caveat to keep in mind, how-
ever, is that this was a population analysis and the
results do not necessarily apply to all individuals. Caus-
ality can only be substantiated, however, in longitudinal
and intervention study designs.
Conclusions
Simple indicators of physical activity volume (i.e., steps/
day) and time in moderate or vigorous intensity physical
activity differ across BMI categories (regardless of sex),
suggesting that these should continue to be targets for
surveillance. In addition, longitudinal and intervention
designs are needed to confirm a causal role in the obe-
sity epidemic. Despite the current interest in breaks in
sedentary time, we found little evidence to support a
noteworthy difference in this accelerometer-determined
behavior across BMI categories. This does not necessa-
rily negate its impact on other outcomes not examined
within the scope of this analysis.
