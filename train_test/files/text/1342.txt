Prevalence of acidosis and inflammation and their association
with low serum albumin in chronic kidney disease.
Background. Low serum albumin is a strong risk factor for
mortality, but its association with low serum bicarbonate and
inflammation in the setting of mild to moderately decreased
kidney function is uncertain.
Methods. We analyzed data from 15,594 subjects over the age
of 20 who participated in the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III). Glomerular filtration
rate (GFR) in mL/min/1.73 m2 was estimated by the abbrevi-
ated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation
using appropriately calibrated serum creatinine.
Results. The age-adjusted prevalence of hypoalbuminemia
(serum albumin <3.8 g/dL) at a GFR of 90, 60, 30, and 15 mL/
min/1.73 m2 was 19%, 21%, 38%, and 59%, respectively, while
the age-adjusted prevalence of C-reactive protein (CRP)  0.22
mg/dL was 36%, 44%, 69%, and 81%, respectively, both P trend
<0.001. Age, female gender, non-Hispanic black compared with
non-Hispanic white race, diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C,
urine albumin: creatinine ratio >1 g/g, dietary protein intake,
dietary caloric intake, serum bicarbonate, CRP, and GFR cat-
egory were all significant predictors of hypoalbuminemia on
univariate analysis. On simultaneously adjusting for the above
variables, hypertension, diabetes, GFR, and dietary protein and
caloric intake were no longer significant independent predictors
of hypoalbuminemia. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of serum bi-
carbonate (by quartile) for hypoalbuminemia was 1.0 for serum
bicarbonate >28 mEq/L (reference), 1.25 for 26­28 mEq/L, 1.51
for 23­25 mEq/L, and 1.54 for 22 meq/L. The adjusted OR of
CRP for hypoalbuminemia was 1.0 for CRP < 0.22 mg/dL (ref-
erence), 2.60 for 0.22­1.0 mg/dL,, and 5.56 for >1.0 mg/dL.
Conclusion. Elevated CRP and low serum bicarbonate are
independently associated with hypoalbuminemia, explaining
much of the high prevalence of hypoalbuminemia in chronic
kidney disease.
Key words: nutrition, GFR, bicarbonate, CRP.

Hypoalbuminemia predicts long-term outcomes for
both hospitalized [1, 2] and apparently healthy individu-
als [3, 4], and is the strongest widely available predictor of
survival in patients treated with maintenance dialysis [5­
7]. The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
study demonstrated a strong cross-sectional association
between hypoalbuminemia and lower glomerular filtra-
tion rate (GFR) among patients with moderate to ad-
vanced kidney dysfunction [8]. Similar results have been
found in several, though not all, smaller studies that ex-
amined this relationship [9]. Two potentially important
confounders of this association, which to date have not
been quantitated, are the effect of acidosis and inflam-
mation, neither of which were examined in relation to
serum albumin in the MDRD study. The potential role
of acidosis may be especially important because hypobi-
carbonatonemia can be readily and safely corrected with
oral alkali supplementation [10].
Hypoalbuminemiaistypicallypresentatthetimeofini-
tiatingdialysis[11,12],anditstronglypredictssubsequent
hospitalization rates [13], as well as the adjusted annual
mortality rate, which, within the United States, continues
to exceed 22% [14]. This poor survival rate has persisted
despite multiple interventions aimed at the dialysis pop-
ulation, and has recently focused attention on strategies
aimed at maintaining the health of patients during the pe-
riod of progressive kidney dysfunction, as distinct from
waiting until the patient requires dialysis and then try-
ing to reverse established deficits [15]. In recognition of
this need, the United States Congress has recently leg-
islated the extension of nutritional supervision to Medi-
care recipients with moderate or severe kidney disease;
however, to date there is almost no population-based evi-
dence as to what the optimal targets should be for several
key nutritional parameters, including serum bicarbonate.
This issue is one of major public health importance be-
cause over 5.6 million subjects within the United States
alone are estimated to have moderate-to-severe chronic
1031
1032 Eustace et al: Hypoalbuminemia in moderate CKD
kidney disease [16], while the number of patients devel-
oping end-stage renal disease is increasing in a exponen-
tial fashion, with rapidly escalating health care costs [14].
Knowledge of the relationship of acidosis and inflam-
mation with hypoalbuminemia at different levels of GFR
is, thus, essential if the results of nutritional screening
programs are to be appropriately interpreted, and if the
potential health and financial benefits of the nutritional
screeningofpatientswith chronic kidney disease are to be
realized. We therefore performed the following analysis
using data from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey III (NHANES III), a large, cross-sectional
study that is representative of the non-institutionalized
United States population, with the purpose of examin-
ing the relationship of acidosis and inflammation with
reduced GFR and, specifically, to examine the con-
founding effect that these factors exert of the observed
association of moderate-severe reductions in GFR and
hypoalbuminemia.
METHODS
This study used data on 15,594 subjects aged 20 years
and older who participated in NHANES III, a cross-
sectional survey conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics, which used a com-
plex, multistage, clustered sampling design to provide
nationally representative data on the civilian, non-
institutionalized United States population [17]. Non-
Hispanic blacks, Mexican-Americans, and the elderly
were deliberately over-sampled to allow more precise es-
timates of effects within these subgroups.
Laboratory methods
Albumin was measured using the bromocresol purple
method, with a coefficient of variation that ranged be-
tween 0.5% to 3.4% during the six years of study. C-
reactive protein (CRP) was measured by latex-enhanced
nephelometry (Behring Diagnostics, Inc., Somerville, NJ,
USA),withthelowerlimitofdetectionof0.22mg/dL,and
a coefficient of variation between 3.3% and 16.1%.
Serum bicarbonate was measured on Hitachi model
737 multichannel analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Di-
agnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Specimens were han-
dled anerobically and frozen at ­70C. Before analysis,
the specimens were gradually thawed over 1 hour, then
immediately upon opening the storage vial they were
manually sampled, thereby avoiding any loss of CO2
with
an associated spurious decrease in the measured total
CO2
[18]. Samples were analyzed using the phosphe-
nolpyruvate method, which measures serum bicarbon-
ate level as well as the much smaller (<0.1%) carbonate
and carbamino factions. The normal reference range for
the method is 23­29 mmol/L, and over the course of the
study the median (range) coefficient of variation was 2.5
(1.0­11.7). Dietary histories were obtained using 24-hour
dietary recalls, collected by a trained dietary interviewer
using an automated, computer-based interview and
coding system. The energy and nutrient content was cal-
culated using the United States Department of Agricul-
ture's Survey Nutrient Database [19].
Creatinine measurements were performed at the
White Sands Research Center laboratory by the modi-
fied kinetic Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi 737 analyzer
(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics), with a coefficient
of variation over the study period of between 0.2% and
1.4%. Repeat creatinine measurements were obtained
after an average of 17 days on 1921 participants, with a
mean (standard deviation) difference between duplicates
of 0.2% (9.7%) [16]. The serum anion gap was measured
as the serum concentrations of [sodium] - ([chloride] +
[bicarbonate]). GFR indexed to 1.73 m2 of body surface
area was estimated using the abbreviated equation devel-
oped at the Cleveland Clinic laboratory from the MDRD
Study as follows: Estimated GFR = 186.3 × (serum cre-
atinine)-1·154 × age-0·203 × (0.742 if female) × (1.21 if
African American) [20, 21]. All GFR measurements are
reported as mL/min/1.73 m2. To correct for the inter-
laboratory variability in the assay type used to measure
serum creatinine, the creatinine results measured at the
White Sands Research Center laboratory for NHANES
III were recalibrated, based on the comparison of frozen
specimens, to the Cleveland Clinic laboratory as used dur-
ing the MDRD study period and upon which the GFR
estimation equation is based [22]. GFR estimates in ex-
cess of 200 were calculated for 0.3% of male and 1.2%
of female NHANES III participants. These values were
considered physiologically implausible and subjects were
assigned a maximal estimated GFR of 200.
Statistical analysis
Prevalence estimates incorporated the sampling
weights provided by the National Center for Health
Statistics. These weights account for the differential prob-
ability of selection and non-response and allow estima-
tion of prevalence in the civilian, non-institutionalized
United States population. All analyses were conducted
using STATA (StataCorp release 6.0, College Station,
TX, USA) `svy' commands for analyzing the complex
survey design of 49 strata and 98 primary sampling units
[23]. These commands implement similar algorithms to
SUDAAN software [24]. A total of 15,674 out of 15,855
participants aged 20 or older that were examined had
both serum creatinine and serum albumin levels available
for analysis. The proportion of participants with missing
data was higher among non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican-
Americans, and other races than among non-Hispanic
whites. The age and gender of participants with missing
data were similar to those in whom complete data were

available. The NHANES III sampling weights were ad-
justed by the proportion of participants missing creati-
nine data in each age, sex, and race-ethnicity strata. This
corrects for differences in missing data across sampling
strata, but assumes that data within strata are missing
randomly. Weighted median regression models, including
fifth-order polynomials of estimated GFR and age, were
used to determine the association of GFR and the 5th,
50th, and 95th percentiles of serum albumin and bicar-
bonate and the 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of CRP
level, adjusting all values to age 60. The association of
estimated GFR with the presence of hypoalbuminemia
(serum albumin <3.8 mg/dL), and the independent ef-
fects of serum bicarbonate and CRP level on the presence
ofhypoalbuminemiawereinvestigatedusingweightedlo-
gistic regression models, adjusting simultaneously for the
effects of potential confounders identified in Table 4.
RESULTS
The population demographics and comorbid data,
stratified by GFR category, are shown in Table 1. Lower
levels of GFR were associated with increased age and
an increased prevalence of hypertension and a higher
proportion of subjects with a caloric intake of less than
20 kcal/kg/day.
The serum albumin level was normally distributed with
a mean of 4.18 g/dL and a standard deviation of 0.38.
Overall, 10.9% and 2.6% of the population had a serum
albumin levels below 3.8 g/dL and 3.5 g/dL, respectively.
Therewasagradedincreaseintheprevalenceofserumal-
bumin levels of less than both 3.8 g/dL and 3.5g/dL across
the four lower GFR categories, P trend < 0.001 (Table 2).
The mean serum bicarbonate level was similar at a GFR
of 60­89 (28.3 mEq/L) and at 30­59 (28.2 mEq/L), al-
thoughthepercentageofsubjectswithserumbicarbonate
below 22 mEq/L increased from 1.3% to 2.3% (Table 2).
At a GFR of 15­29 the mean bicarbonate was signifi-
cantly lower at 24.6 mEq/L, with 19.1% of subjects having
a level below 22 mEq/L. There was a graded relationship
between the proportion of subjects with detectable CRP
levels across the four lower GFR categories, with 58%
of subjects having detectable levels of inflammation at a
GFR of 15­29.
The above-mentioned trends did not extend to the pa-
tients in the highest GFR category (>150). The charac-
teristics of this category differed from the trends seen in
the lower four GFR categories in several major regards.
Subjects in the >150 GFR category were significantly
younger and had a higher proportion of females, while
half of the subjects had a very low serum creatinine, the
median serum creatinine being 0.47 mg/dL. Some of these
differences may be the result of misclassification of GFR
due to the use of the MDRD equation in subjects with
very low serum creatinine (see Discussion). Similarly,
while the proportion of subjects who were of non-
HispanicblackraceincreasedacrossthelowerthreeGFR
categories, it was unexpectedly higher in the upper two
GFR categories.
The strong association between serum albumin and the
various potential confounders of the albumin-GFR rela-
tionship is illustrated in Table 3, which shows the mean

serum albumin at different levels of the examined vari-
ables. In view of the strong relationship between age and
GFR, the age adjusted median (5th and 95th percentile)
serum albumin and bicarbonate levels as estimated by
polynomial regression are shown in Figure 1. In both
cases the median age adjusted value is relatively constant
between a GFR of 60 to 120, but were progressively lower
at GFRs below 60. While this decline is much attenuated
for the upper 95th percentile of the population distribu-
tion, the lowest 5th percentile shows a steeper slope and
more severe deterioration in association with lower GFR.
The median age-adjusted CRP level remained relatively
stable at the minimal limit of detection (0.21 mg/dL), with
only a slight rise at GFRs below 30 (Fig. 2). However, a
substantial minority of the population experienced more
marked elevations, with CRP for the upper 25% of the
distribution being substantially higher at GFRs below 60.
The age-adjusted prevalence of a reduced serum albu-
min and of an elevated CRP at specific cutoffs is shown in
Figure 3. At a GFR of 60, the age-adjusted probability of
having a serum albumin level below 3.8 g/dL was already
substantial at 20.6%, while it almost doubled to 38.5%
at a GFR of 30. The age-adjusted probability of having
an elevated CRP > 0.21 mg/dL also rose from 43.7% to
68.8% at estimated GFRs of 60 and 30, respectively.
Determinants of hypoalbuminemia
Older age, female gender, non-Hispanic black com-
pared with non-Hispanic white race and proteinuria were
all associated with increased odds of hypoalbuminemia
on both univariate and multivariate logistic regression
modeling (Table 4). On univariate analysis a GFR of 30­
59andof15­29werebothsignificantlyassociatedwithhy-
poalbuminemia with large effect sizes [odds ratio (OR)
2.4 and 9.9, respectively]. However, in the multivariate
model only the lowest GFR category had a positive point
estimate associated with hypoalbuminemia, although this
was much attenuated and no longer significant (adjusted
OR 2.8, P = 0.10) compared to the unadjusted estimate.
Similarly, while a total caloric intake of <20 kcal/kg/day
and a total protein intake below 0.7 g/kg/day were signif-
icantly associated with hypoalbuminemia on univariate
analysis, these were no longer significant following ad-
justment for the parameters shown in Table 4. In contrast,
each of the three lower quartiles of serum bicarbonate, as
compared to the highest (reference) quartile, was asso-
ciated with increased OR for hypoalbuminemia on uni-
variate analysis (OR of 1.29, 1.66, and 2.16, respectively).
On multivariate analysis only the lowest quartile had a
moderately attenuated effect size compared to the uni-
variate analysis (adjusted OR 1.54 vs. 2.16), the lower two
quartiles continued to be significant, while the third low-
est quartile (26­28 mEq/L) approached significance (P =
0.06) compared to the highest quartile (>28 mEq/L). On
multivariate analysis, elevated CRP levels were indepen-
dently and strongly associated with an elevated odds of
hypoalbuminemia, with an adjusted OR of 2.6 for CRP
levels of 0.22­1.0 versus <0.22 mg/dL, and an adjusted
OR of 5.56 for CRP level > 1.0 versus <0.22 mg/dL, both
P < 0.001. Similar relationships were evident in both di-
abetic and nondiabetic subjects (Table 5), although with
the smaller available sample size many of these associa-
tionswerenotsignificantinthediabeticstratum.Therela-
tionship between a GFR of 15­29 and hypoalbuminemia
did differ qualitatively by diabetes status, with diabetic
subjects having an OR (95% CI) of 0.76 (0.10, 5.78; P =
0.79) while for nondiabetic subjects the adjusted OR was
4.00 (1.03, 15.50; P = 0.05).
DISCUSSION
The etiology of hypoalbuminemia in kidney disease is
complex and multifactorial. Our results show that while
hypoalbuminemia is associated with reduced GFR as well
as with dietary protein and caloric intake on univariate

As this is a purely observational study this should not
be interpreted as meaning that a focused nutritional in-
tervention might not have the ability to influence serum
albumin levels; it is, for example, likely that some degree
of the acidosis is related in part to the dietary protein
intake. Our results support and extend the findings of

patients with decreased GFR should commence at a GFR
of approximately 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 as recommended by
the National Kidney Foundation's clinical practice guide-
lines for chronic kidney disease [25].
Metabolic acidosis has been shown in a variety of ani-
mal models to induce hypoalbuminemia by means of up-
regulating the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent
ubiquitin proteosome pathway and increasing proteoly-
sis [26]. In maintenance dialysis population the deleteri-
ous effects of moderate/severe hypobicarbonatemia [10]
and the beneficial effects of treatment of severe hypo-
bicarbonatemia have been confirmed [27, 28]. However,

in predialysis patients there has been only limited data,
with at least two small studies supporting the benefits of
bicarbonate supplementation [29, 30], but to date there
has been no large population-based study quantifying the
association of hypobicarbonatemia with serum albumin
levels in patients with mild to moderately reduced GFR.
To this end, we show a strong and graded relationship,
albeit on a cross-sectional basis, between serum bicar-
bonate and the presence of hypoalbuminemia. Although
the effect size of this relationship is modest, this must be
seen within the context of the very strong relationship
between hypoalbuminemia and poor patient outcomes
[6]. This observation is especially important because hy-
pobicarbonatemia may be readily and inexpensively cor-
rected in an outpatient setting by the use of oral alkali,
and we believe that the potential benefit of such ther-
apy in chronic kidney disease needs to be evaluated in an
appropriate clinical trial.
Inflammation by up-regulating proteolysis [31] and by
increasing anorexia [32] would be expected to exacer-
bate hypoalbuminemia. Inflammation is an established
risk factor for dialysis-associated hypoalbuminemia [33,
34], where it is usually attributed to blood-dialyzer inter-
actions, to impurities within the dialysate, or to coexisting
disease. We show that the presence of elevated levels of
acute-phase reactants occurs in a substantial percentage
of subjects in association with moderate reductions in
GFR, and long before the need of requiring dialysis. This
observation is supported by the results of several recent
cross-sectional analyses [35­37].
The reason for this elevation in CRP with azotemia is
unclear. There is no significant net excretion of CRP by
the kidney [38]. Insulin resistance, which develops with
renal insufficiency [39], has been associated with elevated
CRP levels [40, 41], while elevated CRP levels have also
been reported in the setting of microalbuminuria in both
type II diabetic and non-diabetic populations [42, 43]. Re-
gardless of its cause, the proposed association between
progressive azotemia and up-regulated inflammation is
especially important, as several studies have implicated
even low levels of inflammation with the development
of atherosclerotic disease, both in the general population
[44­46] and in dialysis patients [38, 47­49]; such a rela-
tionship may provide an important link explaining the
observed association of malnutrition with cardiovascular
mortality in patients on dialysis [45, 47, 50].
Limitations of our study include its cross-sectional
design, which allows us to identify associations, but
which cannot establish causation. It also renders this
analysis susceptible to incidence-prevalence bias due to
potentially increased mortality rates for patients with
reduced serum albumin, elevated CRP levels, or low
GFR. However, the direction of such a bias would sug-
gest that the prospective association between decreasing
GFR and these variables may be stronger that the ob-
served cross-sectional associations. No information was

available as to whether patients may have sought med-
ical attention for their kidney disease, although mild to
moderate decreases in GFR are often clinically silent, and
patients with a GFR of less than 15, who are more likely to
have come to medical attention, were excluded from our
analyses. As in standard clinical practice we use measured
total CO2
as an estimate of serum bicarbonate; however,
in the absence of appropriate blood gas measurements
we were not able to determine the actual arterial pH or
the contribution of respiratory as distinct from metabolic
processes in determining the net total CO2
level. More-
over, because of the limited number of subjects within the
GFR of 15­29 mL/min category and within the albumin
to creatinine ratio >1.0 category, the precision of these
estimates is particularly limited.
We chose to use estimated GFR in the above analy-
ses due to the non-linear relationship of serum creatinine
with GFR and we opted for the modified MDRD equa-
tion as it does not incorporate serum albumin, which was
our primary outcome variable. The validity of this equa-
tion in patients with very low serum creatinine and a re-
sulting elevated estimated GFR is uncertain. Our analysis
found a GFR greater than 150 to be independently asso-
ciated with hypoalbuminemia, a finding which was not
explained by the prevalence of either diabetes or preg-
nancy within the study population. Instead, we suspect
that a subset of individuals in the highest GFR category
may, in fact, have had a lower true GFR but were misclas-
sified by the MDRD equation due to decreased muscle
mass, and consequently, low serum creatinine level in the
setting of malnutrition. In this regard it is notable that
the MDRD equation was derived from a population with
mean (SD) GFR of 39.8 (21.2) mL/min/1.73 m3 and that
the presence of malnutrition was an exclusion criteria for

study entry. In view of these uncertainties, we feel that
our observations regarding patients with very low serum
creatinine, and, as a result, markedly elevated estimated
GFR should be interpreted with caution until or unless
they are confirmed using an alternative method of esti-
mating GFR.
CONCLUSION
Our results show that proteinuria, serum bicarbonate,
and CRP are independently and significantly associated
with hypoalbuminemia across the spectrum of decreased
GFR. On univariate analysis, GFR and dietary intake
were associated with hypoalbuminemia, but on multivari-
ate analysis these effects were markedly attenuated. The
finding of a high prevalence of inflammatory changes,
and the strong association of elevated levels of inflam-
mation with diminished kidney function, needs careful
prospective confirmation, but may provide a marker for
patients at high risk of malnutrition and serve to explain
some of the greatly accelerated cardiovascular risk seen
with malnourished patients which is evident from the
time that they first initiate dialysis. The observed as-
sociation between acidosis and hypoalbuminemia may
present an important and currently underutilized oppor-
tunity for the optimization of nutrition in patients with
chronic kidney disease. In total, these results support the
need for early diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, and
for prospective studies to identify the optimal manage-
ment of patients with progressive kidney dysfunction, if
the long-term health of such patients is to be successfully
protected.
