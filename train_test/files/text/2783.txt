Objective: The principal objective of this investigation was to compare the naturalistic intra-abdominal
adipose tissue (IAAT) change among black and white women during midlife.
Methods: A cohort of 222 (56%) white and 171 (44%) black midlife women were investigated in the Fat
Patterning Study at the Chicago site of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. The subjects'
total body fat was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and IAAT by a planimetric computed
tomography (at the level of L4
-L5
) annually over up to 4 years.
Results: The total body fat at initial evaluation was higher in black women (45.1% 6 8.2%) when com-
pared with white women (41.3% 6 8.7%, P < 0.001) and did not significantly change over the longitudinal
follow-up. No significant racial differences were found in the mean annualized gain of IAAT (4.4% 6 0.5%)
in models adjusted for total body fat, initial IAAT, age, race, time and race interaction, physical activity,
depressive symptoms, menopausal status, and menopausal hormone therapy.
Conclusions: During a naturalistic observation, black and white midlife women had similar abdominal fat
gain adjusted for differences in baseline adiposity. These data inform future research aimed to prevent
IAAT gain during the critical midlife period of rising cardiovascular risk.

Introduction
Racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and metabolic conditions
have fueled the interest to explore adipose tissue distribution among
white and black women. Intra-abdominal adipose tissue (IAAT) con-
tributes to cardiovascular and metabolic risk regardless of body weight
(1). Midlife women are at higher risk for IAAT accumulation (2,3).
Cross-sectional studies report that white women have more IAAT
than black women for a given total body adiposity (4-8). Although
it has been shown that both white and black women gain IAAT dur-
ing midlife (3), there is no clear understanding about the racial dif-
ferences in the longitudinal change of IAAT.
Clinical trials of weight loss have reported conflicting results on
differences in short-term IAAT change between white and black
women. Some reports suggest a greater average IAAT loss in
white women when compared with black women, whereas others
demonstrate no difference in the percentage of the IAAT loss
among the two races (8-11). There is a need to clarify the racial
specifics of the naturalistic long-term IAAT changes among mid-
life women.
The principal focus of this investigation was to compare the natural-
istic long-term IAAT changes among black and white women during
midlife.
Methods
The Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), a
community-based seven-center observational study, enrolled pre-
menopausal women aged 42-52 years as previously reported (12).
The ancillary Fat Patterning Study conducted at the Chicago site
coincided with the annual SWAN follow-up visits 4 through 11
between 2000 and 2008. Additional 138 premenopausal women
were recruited, because many SWAN participants had already

transitioned through menopause. These women were originally
screened for the SWAN study but were too young to participate at
that time. The details of the Fat Patterning Study have been
described elsewhere (5). Enrollees of the Fat Patterning Study were
similar in all baseline characteristics to those who did not enroll. Of
the 435 women enrolled, 41 were excluded from our analysis due to
surgical hysterectomy (due to distortions of intra-abdominal anat-
omy) or diagnosis of diabetes (due to diabetes and therapy-related
effects on IAAT). Furthermore, 57 women were excluded as they
did not have longitudinal IAAT data. Thus, the final cohort con-
sisted of 337 women, 78% of all Fat Patterning Study participants.
IAAT assessments were conducted annually by planimetric com-
puted tomography obtaining a single 10-mm-thick abdominal image
at the level of L4
-L5
vertebral interspace, as reported previously
(5,13). Scans were read using software developed by the reading
center at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center (RSI,
Boulder, CO). This protocol is in line with other longitudinal studies
that use planimetric (cm2) rather than volumetric methodology to
estimate IAAT volume or weight (cm3 or kg). Planimetric IAAT
assessment at the level of L4
-L5
vertebral interspace correlates well
with total IAAT volume and has been used most frequently in other
large studies (14,15). Total body fat was assessed on the same day
with whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (GE-Lunar,
Madison, WI) and expressed as a percent of fat in soft tissue. Scans
were analyzed with GE-Lunar enCORE software (GE-Lunar).
A standardized SWAN protocol was used to assess age, race, men-
strual bleeding patterns, hormone therapy use, depressive symptoms,
and physical activity, as previously described (16). For the purpose
of the current analysis, the women who had no menstrual bleeding
in the 12 months prior to assessment were classified as postmeno-
pausal. Hormone therapy was determined as use of estrogen or pro-
gesterone alone or in combination. Physical activity was estimated
at the initial assessment as a sum score of modified Kaiser
Physical Activity Survey (17), and depressive symptoms were
assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D; ref. 18).
Distributions of the variables were checked, and violations of nor-
mality were detected in the outcome of interest, IAAT, which was
log-transformed. Time was calculated in years based on assessment
completion dates. A series of linear mixed-effects models were con-
ducted with log-transformed IAAT as the outcome and race as the
principal predictor, adjusting for time, age at initial assessment, total
body fat (time-varying), and IAAT at the initial assessment (Model
1); with additional adjustment for time and race interaction (Model
2); and adding menopausal status, hormone use, physical activity,
and depressive symptoms (Model 3). The annualized percent change
in IAAT was calculated multiplying the time estimate by 100 (19).
Model fit was evaluated with appropriate diagnostics. All analyses
were conducted using PC-SASV
R 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
The race-stratified cohort characteristics at the initial assessment are
shown in Table 1. There were no racial differences in age or meno-
pausal stage. Black women were less likely to use hormonal therapy
and had lower physical activity and higher depressive symptom
scores.
The average follow-up time between the first and the last IAAT
assessments was 2.1 6 0.4 years, with a median of three IAAT
assessments per participant. The annualized total body fat change
20.32 (95% CI 5 0.74-0.10) was nonsignificant in both races. As
shown in Table 2, there were no differences in annualized IAAT
gain estimate between black and white women. The estimated mean
annualized percent of IAAT gain was 3.9%, after adjustment for
age, race, initial IAAT, and time-varying total body fat (Model 1).
Likewise, the mean annualized IAAT gain was 4.4% in the models
that additionally adjusted for annual IAAT and race interaction
(Model 2), and also menopausal status, menopausal hormone ther-
apy, depressive symptoms, and physical activity (Model 3). Like-
wise, no significant racial differences in the IAAT change were
found when the models did not include the adjustment for total
body fat (results not shown).
Discussion
The principal finding was that community-dwelling black and white
midlife women had similar rates of naturalistic IAAT gain over up
to 4 years of adiposity assessments. The comparisons were con-
ducted with adjustment for total adiposity, as cross-sectional studies
suggested racial differences in IAAT after adjustments for total
body fat (4-7). Although short-term IAAT changes during weight
loss have been studied previously (8-11), our report provides a
unique racial comparison of long-term IAAT gain in a naturalistic
setting among midlife women.
Black women had significantly higher total body fat than white
women, which may explain no significant racial differences in unad-
justed IAAT area at the initial assessment. This finding is consistent
with previously published baseline IAAT comparisons from the

SWAN Fat Patterning Study (4,5,13) and aligns with other published
research, suggesting that white women have more IAAT than black
women after adjustment for differences in total body fat (6-8).
The principal strength was a naturalistic longitudinal observation of
adiposity changes in a community-based, representative sample of
midlife women from a well-characterized cohort, with validated
methodology applied for assessment of intra-abdominal and total
body fat across the representational adiposity spectrum. Our report
is also distinct for demonstrating the similar rates of long-term
IAAT gain among black and white midlife women, without signifi-
cant change in total body fat over time (i.e., similar rates of adipose
tissue redistribution during midlife in black and white women). Our
findings are in line with a similar study (20), which also found no
racial differences and larger changes in IAAT than in total body fat.
However, their cohort was younger, normal weight or with recent
intentional weight loss to achieve normal weight (20).
The potential limitation of this study was planimetric rather than volu-
metric methodology used for IAAT assessments. To date, more stud-
ies have used planimetric (cm2) rather than volumetric methodology
(cm3 or kg) to estimate IAAT. A planimetric IAAT assessment at the
level of the L4
-L5
vertebral interspace (as a proxy for a volumetric
IAAT assessment) has been used commonly in epidemiological stud-
ies, where larger sample sizes compensate for the lower precision of
planimetric methodology (14,15). Volumetric measurement of IAAT
change has been necessary for smaller studies, limited by the need for
higher measurement precision (14,15). Our study used the "annualized
percent of IAAT change" as a practical metric that permits compari-
sons across studies or methodologies for IAAT estimation (14,15).
Thus, our findings can be applied to design intervention trials for the
prevention of IAAT gain during the midlife transition.
Conclusion
The mean annualized percent of IAAT change was similar among
black and white midlife women after adjustment for total body fat,
baseline IAAT, age, menopausal status, hormone therapy, depressive
symptoms, and physical activity. Although weight loss interventions
are important, a more rational way to reduce cardiometabolic risk dur-
ing midlife is to prevent menopause-associated IAAT gain in the first
place. As the IAAT gain was similar among black and white women,
the same preventive abdominal adiposity targets apply to both races.O
