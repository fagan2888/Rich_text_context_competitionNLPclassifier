Unemployment, depression, and health: a look at
the African-American community
Eunice Rodriguez, Josephine A Allen, Edward A Frongillo Jr, Pinky Chandra
Abstract
Objectives--While the unemployment
rate of African-American people is more
than twice that of the white population,
the research on the impact of unemploy-
ment on the health of this population is
scarce. This study analysed the impact of
unemployment on depression and well
being among African-American people,
and the factors associated with well being.
Methods--Logistic and multiple
regression models were used to analyse
panel data collected in the National Sur-
vey of Families and Households 1987­1992.
African-American (1369) and white (6660)
respondents were analysed separately.
Outcome variables included an index of
depression and self reported health status.
Main findings--DiVerences between em-
ployment and unemployment groups were
less significant for African-Americans
than for the white population in predicting
depression and well being. Health enhanc-
ing factors such as education and wealth
were significantly associated with better
health and lower depression indices
among the white population but not
consistently so among African-
Americans. Satisfaction with personal
relationships was the strongest predictor
of well being for both groups.
Conclusion--Research should focus on
the special needs and circumstances of
African-Americans, because protective
factors may not have the same impact in
diVerent groups of the population.

During the past 20 years unemployment levels
have increased dramatically in Western coun-
tries, and reducing unemployment has domi-
nated the policy agenda of industrialised coun-
tries. The USA has been very successful in
lowering the overall unemployment rate to 5.3
per cent during the first quarter of 1997, but it
remains much higher for some groups of the
population. While the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate for the white population is
down to 4.5 per cent, it is 10.9 per cent for
African-Americans,1 and 8.3 per cent for
Hispanics of all origins.
Not only are African-Americans among the
hardest hit by unemployment, but they tend to
occupy lower paying occupations. For instance,
while in 1993 the median weekly earnings for
full time wage and salaried white workers were
$478, they were only $370 for African-
American workers.2 Inheritances are also an
important contributor to wealth diVerences
between African-American and white people.
It has been estimated that the contribution of
lifetime inheritances to wealth diVerences is
comparable to that resulting from lifetime
earning diVerences.3 In addition, among
African-American family heads, labour force
participation rates are declining and female
headed households are rising. African-
Americans are over-represented in female
householder families and in general tend to
stay in poverty longer than white people.
There is an extensive social science and epi-
demiological literature on the relation between
poverty, household income, and health,4­10
which reports the health impact of unemploy-
ment. Some studies have shown that persons in
poorer health are more likely to lose their jobs
and persons in better health are more likely to
be re-employed,11­13 supporting what is called a
selection process, which may explain--at least
partially--health diVerences between em-
ployed and unemployed persons. However, a
large number of qualitative14­17 and
quantitative18­21 studies have provided a wealth
of empirical evidence relative to the health
eVects of unemployment. An increase in
mortality rates, depression, substance abuse,
admissions to psychiatric hospitals, and vio-
lence are among the most salient outcomes
associated with a rise in unemployment
levels.22­25 In addition, job loss is associated
with the loss of health insurance in the USA.
Although the health impact of unemploy-
ment has been widely studied, there is a paucity
of information on the social interventions that
could have a long term protective impact on
mental and overall health status. In addition,
ethnicity is usually included in unemployment
analyses as a controlling variable among other
sociodemographic characteristics. Rarely are
diVerent groups analysed separately, limiting
our understanding of the diVerent dynamics
and mechanisms operating in the prediction of
mental and general health status. Furthermore,
the lack of adequate longitudinal data has
made it diYcult to study those elements that
could have long term protective impacts on
both mental health, and family and social
functioning, during the transition from jobless-
ness to stable employment.
This paper examines the factors that explain
the impact of unemployment on depression
and overall health perception among both
African-American and white people separately.
We use a longitudinal design to clarify the
direction of the relations. We include an analy-
sis of how public assistance programmes could
enable people to cope successfully during peri-
ods of unemployment. We explore in detail sex

ing, Atlanta, 1996).
It has been argued that the diVerences
between ethnic or racial groups are mostly
explained by socioeconomic diVerences,26 27
but most studies show that adjusting for socio-
economic status reduces but does not eliminate
health disparities among ethnic groups.28­30
Race or racism, or both, also plays a part in
determining employment status, education, or
income. Research to understand the impact of
ethnicity and socioeconomic status on health
has been increasing in recent years31 32 but more
research is still needed if we are to understand
the complex interactions of these factors.33
Here, we analyse African-American and white
people separately to investigate possible diVer-
ences between these two groups in the relations
that multiple factors have with depression and
general health assessment. We are interested in
analysing the predictors of depression among
each group independently.
Methods
SAMPLE
We analysed panel data collected in the
National Survey of Families and Households
(NSFH) 1987­1992, which combines data on
unemployment, the receipt of unemployment
compensation, perception of health status, and
mental health outcomes. The 1987 NSFH
study interviewed 13 014 respondents, includ-
ing an over-sample of minorities and house-
holds containing single parent families, step-
families, recently married couples, and
cohabiting couples. A total of 2390 African-
American respondents were included in the
study. The 1992­93 survey includes an inter-
view of all surviving members of the original
sample. A total of 10 008 respondents were
reinterviewed; this represents an attrition rate
of 23 per cent.
We limited our analysis to those respondents
who were between 17 and 65 years of age in
1987, and who were reinterviewed in 1992­93.
The total number of respondents included in
our analysis was 8029; of those 1369 were
African-American and 6660 white people. We
used two strategies to better control for a pos-
sible reverse causation eVect. Firstly, we only
included those that in 1987 reported not
having any physical or mental limitation that
would prevent them from working; and sec-
ondly, we controlled for previous depression
and employment history.
MEASURES
We used two outcome measures. The first
measure was a depression index created from
the responses to 15 items of the Center for
Epidemiological Studies' Depression Scale
(CES-D) included in the survey; the reliability
and validity of these items has been reported
elsewhere.34 The possible response range was 0
to 105. The second measure was a self reported
measure of perception of overall health status.
The outcome measure of how respondents
would describe their health compared with
other people their age consisted on a 5 point
scale (1-very poor; 5-excellent), and we re-
duced it to two groups. Good or excellent
health; compared with fair, poor, or very poor
health.
An employment variable was constructed
from several variables that asked about re-
spondents' employment and sources of income
in 1992. Employed respondents were catego-
rised into full and part time employed,
depending on whether they worked 30 hours or
more, or 29 or less a week.
When comparing unemployed people to
those employed, one of the most obvious
critiques is that, if we included all employed
into a single category, we would be putting
together those who have favourable working
conditions with those that may have unfavour-
able and even health threatening jobs, (E Rod-
riguez, et al, International congress on women,
work and health, Barcelona, 1996) thus,
making their comparison with unemployed
people less meaningful. Therefore, we divided
the employed population (both full and part
time workers) into two categories according to
their self reporting of whether or not they were
satisfied with their jobs. Satisfaction with paid
job was rated on a 7 point scale. We put
together those who were satisfied or very satis-
fied, and the rest were classified as "others", or
less than satisfied with their current employ-
ment situation. We should note that we do not
have a clear understanding of the causes that
are related to satisfaction with employment.
Those could range from satisfaction with
coworkers and supervisors, to schedule prefer-
ences or benefits packages. Nevertheless, we
consider that overall satisfaction with employ-
ment should be taken into consideration. In
addition, we created a diVerent category of
those working people who were simultaneously
receiving welfare benefits, and followed the
same strategy of dividing them into satisfied
and less than satisfied with their employment.
Given the low number of men working and
receiving welfare, we only included these
groups in the analysis of the female population.
Respondents who were not working for pay
or were completely retired were grouped into
diVerent categories of unemployment. We
defined unemployed as any person not holding
a job, regardless of whether they were actively
looking for work or not. Firstly, those looking
for work during the four weeks before the
interview, and those not actively looking for
work were separated into two categories. Then,
each of those groups were further divided into
three categories: (a) people receiving public
assistance, including AFDC, general assist-
ance, food stamps or energy assistance; (b)
people who were receiving income from
entitlement government benefit programmes,
such as veterans' benefits, unemployment
compensation, worker's compensation or sup-
plemental security income; (c) people who
were not receiving any type of income or
economic assistance. This last group of non-
working people is diYcult to interpret; we do
not know how many of those are housewives by
choice, students, or simply discouraged unem-
ployed persons not eligible for any kind of
336 Rodriguez, Allen, Frongillo Jr, et al
benefits. No question included in the survey
allowed us to diVerentiate among those three
groups of people included in the same category
of non-employed and not looking for work
without receiving any benefits.
Those who were completely retired in 1992
were in a separate category. Tables 1 and 2
show levels of depression and general health
perception for the diVerent employment
groups. The type of employment situations was
operationalised as dummy variables, with the
satisfied full time employed category as the
comparison group in the equation of our mul-
tiple regression models described in the results
section of our paper.
In addition, the following factors were
included in our analysis:
1 individual characteristics: age, and whether
or not the respondent reported any physical
or mental condition that would limit their
ability to work for pay in 1992;
2 education: years of education in 1992, and
whether or not the respondent attended any
type of training or schooling between 1987
and 1992;
3 household characteristics: Being a house-
hold head. Total household income (control-
ling for number of household members),
total family assets, and total debts;
4 informal social support: marital status,
frequency of social contacts, and satisfaction
with relationships (family and friends);
5 job search history: weeks unemployed in
1991 (that is, year before the second
interview was conducted);
6 environmental variables: percentage of un-
employment in the state, and per capita dol-
lars available for unemployment subsidy in
the state of residency;
7 1987 employment status, index of depres-
sion or health status, and social support
available.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Multiple regression analyses examined the
relation between depression and other factors.
Our outcome variable was a scale with a range
of 0­105. We transformed the index of depres-
sion to log (depression + 0.05) to better fit the
assumptions of multiple regression analyses.
We used a Box-Cox transformation of the
income, assets and debts variables, a frequently
used procedure to better deal with outlying
values. The transformations were suYcient to
produce reasonable residual plots. The appro-
priate regression diagnostic tests were per-
formed to assess the fit of the model.
The analysis was constructed to make the
best use of the longitudinal design to examine
the impact of unemployment and other factors
on depression. The outcome variable was
depression in 1992. Depression in 1987 was
included as a covariate. As earlier depression
was controlled, the regression coeYcients for
unemployment and the other factors included
in regression models estimated the eVects of
these variables on changes in depression that
occurred between 1987 and 1992. We used a
dynamic model, appropriate for the analysis of
longitudinal data, which incorporates the time
elapsed between data collection points by
modeling events in discrete time.35
The classic assumptions of correct specifica-
tion, homoscedasticity, and normality were
checked by analysing the residual plots. In
addition, diagnostic tests were performed for
collinearity and no problems were found. Only
two variables, assets and debts, had a relatively

not problematic because subsequent collinear-
ity analysis using condition indices confirmed
the appropriateness of including both variables
in the model.
We used a logistic regression model to
analyse the prediction of perceived health
status. We did not replace any missing values in
the dependent variables. For the categorical
independent variables we added an option of
"no response" where necessary, in order to
include all respondents in our analysis. For the
continuous independent variables (income,
assets and debts), we replaced missing values
by imputing them with the predicted value for
the age, sex, ethnic, marital, and occupational
group of the respondent.
Results
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
Index of depression
Both African-American and white women had
more symptoms of depression than their male
counterparts (see table 1). Among both
African-American and white women, those
employed part time and who reported satisfac-
tion with their jobs reported lower indices of
depression. Among African-American people,
the retired and full time employed satisfied
with their jobs were next in reporting low
depression; the same groups reported lower
depression among white people but in reverse
order.
Among African-American people, the most
depressed were the unemployed women look-
ing for work while receiving welfare or other
government benefits, followed by those who
were receiving welfare and were either not
working and not looking for work, or employed
but not satisfied with their jobs. In reporting
symptoms of depression, no diVerence was
found between welfare recipients not working
or working but not satisfied with their jobs*;
only those who were receiving welfare and sat-
isfied with their jobs reported slightly lower
depression. Among white people, the most
depressed were those receiving welfare while
unemployed, followed by those receiving wel-
fare and working simultaneously but not satis-
fied with their jobs.
In most employment groups, African-
American people reported higher indices of
depression, with the exception of non-working
welfare recipients. Among this group, white
people reported slightly higher depression than
black people. An interesting diVerence is that
the non-working white population (not actively
looking for work and not receiving any type of
benefits) reported lower depression than work-
ing women (both full and part time employed)
not satisfied with their jobs; among African-
American people, the same group of non-
working women (not actively looking for work
and not receiving any type of benefits) reported
higher depression than the dissatisfied em-
ployed.
General health perceptions
Regarding general health perceptions, we
observe a similar pattern (see table 2). For both
African-American and white populations,
those who report better health status are the
full and part time employed satisfied with their
jobs, followed by the welfare recipients who
work and are satisfied with their jobs. The
groups that report lower health levels are
unemployed women, especially those not
actively looking for work and receiving welfare
benefits.
MULTIPLE REGRESSION AND LOGISTIC
REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Index of depression
Table 3 presents the results of our multiple
regression model including the variables that
we hypothesised could have an impact on
depression in 1992, while controlling for occu-
pational status and other variables in 1987.
The significant factors for depression observed
for all groups include: having a physical or
mental condition that would limit the ability of
working for pay; not being satisfied with their
relationships with family and friends; and the
index of depression previously reported in
1987. Age was significant in all groups except
white men. In addition, years of education was
related to lower depression symptoms for all
groups, with the exception of African-
American women.
Some of the most notable diVerences
between black and white women include the
impact of years of education. While for white
women, more years of education was related to
lower symptoms of depression, years of educa-
tion was not significant in reducing depression
among African-American women. The same
diVerence is observed regarding the impact of
attending school between the interview periods
(1987­1992). While being divorced, widowed
or separated was significantly related to depres-
sion among white women, there were no
significant diVerences for African-American
women. In contrast, being the head of the
household was associated with more symptoms
of depression among African-American
women but not among white women.
We observed other diVerences between
African-American and white men. Longer
periods of unemployment in 1991 was related
to a lower depression index for white men,
*The number of repondents working while receiving welfare
and not satisfied with their jobs was very small and given that it
is not possible to attribute statistical significance, we do not
show them in our tables.
KEY POINTS
x Employment situation was related to
depression for white men and women, but
not consistently for African-American.
x Household income was not significantly
related to depression after controlling for
assets and debts.
x Wealth indicated by total assets was a
predictor of depression for white but not
for African-American people.
x For all four groups, satisfaction with per-
sonal relationships (including family and
friends) was positively associated with
better health status.
338 Rodriguez, Allen, Frongillo Jr, et al
while no significant impact was observed
among African-American men. In contrast
with what we see among women, divorced,
widower or separated black men were more
likely to be depressed than married ones, but
no significant diVerence was observed among
white men.
Household income was not significantly
related to depression after controlling for assets
and debts. Total assets were significant for
white people but not for African-Americans.
Debts were only significant for white women.
While wealth indicated by total assets is a
significant predictor of depression for white
people even after controlling for all the other
variables included in the model, it is not the
case for African-American people. Being a
household head was related to more symptoms
of depression among African-American, but
not among white people.
For African-American women, there was no
statistical diVerence among employment
groups. After controlling for all the factors
included in our model, the employment situa-
tion did not influence the likelihood of report-
ing depression for African-American women.
The higher index of depression observed
among the unemployed in relation to those
satisfactorily employed (see table 1) was not
significant when other personal and socioeco-
nomic factors are controlled for in the analysis.
In contrast for white women, there was a sig-
nificantly higher index of depression among
those employed but not satisfied with their
jobs. White women also reported more depres-
sion symptoms while being unemployed and
receiving social benefits (mostly welfare).
White and African-American men were
significantly more depressed when unem-
ployed and looking for work, but being unem-
ployed for a longer period during the previous
year had a protective eVect on depression for
white men.
Health status
For all four groups, satisfaction with personal
relationships (including family and friends)
was positively associated with better health sta-
tus, and having a physical or mental condition
that would limit the ability to work for pay was
inversely related to health perception as was the
case with previous reports of poor health in
1987 (see table 4).
Several factors were significant for white
people but not for African-American people in
predicting health status: years of education,
total household assets, and the amount of
unemployment benefits available at the state
level.
Age was associated with reporting worse
health status among both groups of men, but it
was not significant for women. Interestingly,
white men who were divorced, widowed or
separated reported better health status than
married men.
When comparing people with diVerent
employment statuses in 1992, employment
status among African-American men was not a

Unemployment, depression, and health 339
significant variable in predicting health status.
Among African-American women only being
unemployed while receiving benefits was sig-
nificantly related to a higher likelihood of
reporting fair or poor health status. Among
white men, and women, unemployed people
not looking for work reported significantly
worse health status when compared with the
fully employed. Among the employed white
women, those who were not satisfied with their
jobs also reported worse health.
Discussion
This study relies on self reported survey data,
and its strengths and limitations depend
ultimately on factors related to the correct
assessment of theoretical and statistical as-
sumptions of the analytical model, the
adequate--albeit never perfect--way of dealing
with missing values and attrition, and the
causal inferences made in interpreting the
results.36
We are confident that our study can facilitate
a better understanding of what aspects of the
individual and social environment contribute
to reducing the negative influence of stressors
such as unemployment. However, interpreta-
tions of causality should be made cautiously.
For instance, people receiving benefits diVer in
many ways from people not receiving benefits,
and these may not be fully controlled through
the background covariates used in our analysis.
Our exclusion criteria, and the factors we con-
trol for in our model, should eliminate most of
the diVerences among the various groups of
unemployed people, but uncontrolled variables
determining both unemployment resources
and health outcomes may still exist. One of the
strengths of the study was the use of longitudi-
nal data to specify the direction of the relation.
No significant diVerences in levels of health
status were found between employed and
unemployed African-American men, nor in
depression for African-American women. In
addition, white men and women not satisfied
with their jobs reported higher depression lev-
els than those satisfied with their jobs and
unemployed not looking for work report lower
health status.
It could be that African-American people do
not derive the same satisfaction from employ-
ment that white people do. It is true, however,
that the historical imprints of slavery, emanci-
pation, Jim Crow Laws*, segregation, the Civil
Rights Struggle, discrimination, and institu-
tional racism have aVected the degree to which
a range of coping strategies have been adopted
by African-American people. The unpredict-
ability of continuous employment resulting

*During the early 20th century, racial subordination was
re-established as Jim Crow statutes were introduced, creating
two societies, one black and one white, separate and unequal. In
1896, a legal precedent was established by the Supreme Court
in the Plessy v Ferguson decision that sanctioned a "separate
but equal" doctrine, creating a system of apartheid in which Jim
Crow laws were passed by legislatures of the Southern states
based on the belief than even though slavery had been abolished,
black people were inherently inferior and not worthy of the full
rights of citizenship granted by the Civil Rights Act of 1875 and
the Fourteenth Amendment.

from periodic economic shifts, structured soci-
etal inequality, and societal attitudes about race
have made it necessary for this group to depend
less upon employment for their general sense of
well being and mental health.37 38 In fact, as
shown in table 1, African-Americans reported
higher incidences of depression in most
employment status groups than their white
counterparts.
Alternative explanations may suggest firstly
that African-American men and women may
be employed largely in situations where access
to health and mental health benefits are not
widely available or secondly, that trust in the
medical profession has been so compromised
that regular health evaluations (preventive
visits to health care providers) are not done.
Among both African-American and white
women, no diVerence was found between those
working while receiving welfare and the full
time satisfactorily employed. However, it
would be precipitous to extrapolate this finding
to the new situation created by the recent wel-
fare reform, legislation, in which working will
be a compulsory requirement for a larger
segment of welfare recipients.
Years of education was a significant predictor
of lower depression and better health status
among white people, but it was not related to
health status among African-American men or
women, and significantly related to depression
only among men. Once more, it could be that
factors not included in our model (for example,
racial discrimination) are a reality in the lives of
African-Americans, so that the gains obtained
by education are not as directly observable as
among white people. The same could be said
about the lack of significant impact of house-
hold assets for African-Americans, while for
white people more wealth significantly predicts
lower depression and better health status. In all
models income was not significant when wealth
and assets are controlled for in this study,
which suggests that total family assets may be a
better measure of social class than household
income.
In conclusion, our study challenges some of
the conventional knowledge when applied to
African-American people. While education has
a clear impact on depression and well being
among white people, why is it that the
association is less significant for African-
Americans, and especially for African-
American women? While reporting satisfaction
with employment is significantly associated
with better mental health (in comparison with
those not satisfied with their work) among
white people, why is it that we do not see a sig-
nificant diVerence among African-American
people when we control for the other factor in
our model? And why are greater assets
associated with better mental health and well
being among white people but not among
African-American people?
In this paper we speculate about possible
answers to these questions, but more important
than our own speculations and interpretations
are the questions themselves. They open the
way to a--if not new--very necessary line of
inquiry to better understand the dynamics of
health and illness among the diVerent groups
in the population. By continuing to study these
issues and pursuing the questions we will be
able to better understand the increasing health
and mortality diVerences between African-
American and white people observed in the
same occupational categories.39 Only then can
we encourage the best ways of fostering the well
being of all segments of the population.
