Abstract: In three studies, we tested the hypothesis that men respond to intersexual and
intrasexual selection by facultatively choosing between weapon-like and ornament-like
behaviors. In the first two studies, we manipulated intersexual and intrasexual selection by
having male participants take part in a simulated dating game (Study 1) or imagine having a
date (Study 2). In both studies, participants were told either that the target female would
choose her date (intersexual) or that male suitors would nominate one another (intrasexual).
Under the intersexual selection condition, men demonstrated increased creativity levels and
decreased aggression levels, whereas the opposite pattern was observed under the intrasexual
selection condition. Study 3 showed that individual differences in creativity and aggression
as personality traits similarly predicted intrasexual and intersexual mating strategies,
respectively. These extend existing evolutionary mating research by specifying the
mechanism of intrasexual or intersexual selection in shaping men's weapon-like or
ornament-like situational response and personality development.

Introduction
Sexual dimorphism results from sexual selection, whereby intrasexual competition
(primarily among the unlimited sex, typically males) and mate choice (primarily by the
limiting sex, typically females) lead to the dimorphic traits known as weapons and ornaments
(Andersson, 1994; Darwin, 1859; Fisher, 1930; Trivers, 1972). Canine teeth, horns, claws,
and the sheer size and strength of certain male animals provide strong examples of physical
weapons, and aggression is a behavioral weapon among humans and other animals. A
peacock's tail, which is useless and costly to sustain, is the most famous example of an
ornament. Showing off and creativity may be the human equivalents of this ornamentation
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament

(Miller, 2000). Certain polygynous species, such as the elephant seal, become weapon
specialists, relying primarily on intrasexual combat to achieve reproductive success. Other
species, such as the peacock and numerous birds of paradise, specialize in intersexual
selection to produce extravagant male ornaments. Humans are versatile animals who rely on
a large brain to facilitate amassing and facultatively employing a large repertoire of survival
and reproductive strategies, including weapons and ornaments.
Even though ancestral men may have used intrasexual combat more than intersexual
ornaments in acquiring mates (Puts, 2010) and much human female choice may also have
derived from male contests (Berglund et al., 1996), modern men use both intrasexual and
intersexual mating strategies as evidenced by much research showing a clear association
between mating motivation and various behaviors that constitute weapons and ornaments in
men. Specific weapon-like behaviors under mating investigation include physical or direct
aggression in response to provocation (Daly and Wilson, 1988; Griskevicius et al., 2009;
Kirkpatrick, Waugh, Valencia, and Webster, 2002; Terrell, Patock-Peckham, and Nagoshi,
2009), throwing darts at humanoid rather than inanimate object targets (Mussweiler and
Forster, 2000), social dominance and status (Li et al., 2013; Valentine, Li, Penke, and Perrett,
2014), endorsing warring attitudes (Chang, Lu, Li, and Li, 2011), and producing a low voice
pitch (Puts, Doll, and Hill, 2014). The studied ornament-like behaviors include conspicuous
material consumption (Griskevicius et al., 2007; Sundie et al., 2011), risk taking (Baker and
Maner, 2008; Frankenhuis, Dotsch, Karremans, and Wigboldus, 2010; Pawlowski, Atwal,
and Dunbar, 2008; Ronay and von Hippel, 2010), humor (Greengross and Miller, 2011),
being unique and non-conforming (Griskevicius, Goldstein, Mortensen, Cialdini, and
Kenrick, 2006), becoming loss averse (Li, Kenrick, Griskevicius, and Neuberg, 2012),
making generous financial donations (Iredale, Van Vugt, and Dunbar, 2008), and exhibiting
heroic altruism (Griskevicius et al., 2007), all of which are preferred by women.
These studies suggest that, similar to other male animals, men can exhibit weapon-
like and ornament-like behaviors, but, unlike many male animals that specialize in either
weapons or ornaments nearly to the exclusion of the other, men seem to have developed the
versatility to acquire and apply both strategies to facultatively respond to intrasexual and
intersexual competition. Men may use weapons and ornaments facultatively as situational
responses to intersexual and intrasexual conditions and, over time, may also develop
behavioral tendencies in using one strategy more frequently over the other, adding to the vast
individual differences along a weapon-ornament dimension. However, existing mating
research has not investigated this potential human versatility either in terms of facultative
situational response or in terms of personality differences. Because male contest, female
choice, and sperm competition are all involved in human mating (Puts, 2010), not
distinguishing the facultative use among different strategies prevents existing studies from
identifying the specific sexual selection mechanism driving a particular mating behavior.
Specifically, existing studies have not manipulated intrasexual and intersexual conditions to
determine whether men respond using weapon-like or ornament-like behaviors. Instead, the
typical research paradigm has involved activating a general male mating motivation by
exposing male participants to attractive female photographs (e.g., Lu and Chang, 2012) or
by making them think about romantic partners or events (e.g., Griskevicius et al., 2009) and
observing their behavioral responses. Although the subsequent behavioral responses can be
shown to be either weapons or ornaments, few studies have concurrently examined these two
outcomes or have empirically linked them to intrasexual or intersexual selection conditions.

Some studies using the general mating motivation approach have obtained results
similar to mapping intrasexual or intersexual conditions with weapon-like or ornament-like
behaviors, but have not included both selection conditions or both behavioral outcomes in
the same study. For example, Frankenhuis et al. (2010) had male participants walk across a
rope bridge toward a female or male target in a 3D, virtual reality setting. A female or male
experimenter guided the participants to cross the bridge. Although it was not the intention of
the study, the design yielded intrasexual (i.e., male target and female experimenter or female
target and male experimenter) and intersexual conditions (i.e., female target and female
experimenter) for the male participants. Frankenhuis et al. (2010) examined risk taking,
which is an ornament-like behavior, based on the speed at which the male participants
crossed the bridge. As expected, the participants moved the fastest under the intersexual
condition (M = .62 m/s) and slowest under the intrasexual condition (M = .46 m/s), but the
study did not include weapon-like behavior.
In another example, Griskevicius et al. (2009) induced a general mating motivation
by having male participants envision a romantic scenario and examined their physical
aggression toward imagined insults from a same-sex stranger. However, the focus of this
study was the audience effect of either a male or a female spectator witnessing the insult. The
general mating motivation and the spectator manipulation together generated the additional
intrasexual (male witness) and intersexual (female witness) conditions. The results indicated
that when the witness was male (intrasexual), the general mating motivation affected direct
aggression of the male participants, whereas when the witness was female (intersexual),
mating motivation did not influence aggression. The study did not include ornament-like
behavior to assess the possibility of facultative switching between the two mating strategies.
Finally, Hodges-Simeon, Gaulin, and Puts (2011; also see Puts, Gaulin, and
Verdolini, 2006) showed that voice pitch as a weapon was related to intrasexual competition.
In this study, male participants introduced themselves to a female date (intersexual condition)
and then addressed a male suitor of that date (intrasexual condition). The participants' speech
was recorded during both conditions. The results showed that a monotone voice, representing
intrasexual dominance or a weapon-like strategy, was exhibited during the intrasexual but
not the intersexual condition. Again, the contrasting effect on ornament-like behavior was
not investigated. Together, these studies suggest that men potentially use weapons and
ornaments facultatively in response to intrasexual and intersexual selection conditions, even
though no study has explicitly manipulated both sexual selection conditions or has
investigated both weapon-like and ornament-like behavioral outcomes.
In the present study, we manipulated intrasexual and intersexual conditions to
observe the corresponding weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors among men. Creativity
and aggression were used as ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors, respectively, to test
the hypothesis that intersexual selection situations increase ornamental displays, whereas
intrasexual selection situations increase the use of weapons. Creativity may be a human
ornament that evolved through intersexual selection (Haselton and Miller, 2006; Miller,
2000). It is a costly and a reliable indicator of mental and physical fitness (Förster, Friedman,
and Liberman, 2004; but see also Puts [2010] for criticism) and is therefore worth showing
off to draw the attention of potential mates (Griskevicius, Cialdini, and Kenrick, 2006;
Miller, 2000). Recent studies have shown that creativity can be situationally enhanced based
on mating motives (e.g., Förster, Epstude, and Özelsel, 2009; Griskevicius, Cialdini, et al.,
2006). Aggression that is directly related to intrasexual combat obviously functions as
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament

weapon-like behavior (Puts, 2010). Aggression and war have been associated with mating
success in both prehistoric and modern societies (Chagnon, 1988; Daly and Wilson, 1988;
Puts, 2010). For example, in the hunter-gatherer Hadza tribes in Tanzania, the courtship of a
woman by multiple male suitors could cause aggressive or even fatal combat among men
(Marlowe, 2004). These studies confirm the validity of aggression and creativity as weapon-
like and ornament-like mating strategies.
We conducted three studies. In the first two studies, we manipulated two dating
situations relevant to intrasexual and intersexual selection, and examined how they
influenced aggression (as a weapon) and creativity (as an ornament). In Study 3, we
conducted a questionnaire investigation to examine whether being creative and aggressive as
personality traits were also associated with intersexual courtship and intrasexual competition,
respectively.
Study 1
In Study 1, we tested the hypothesis that men demonstrated weapon-like as opposed
to ornament-like behaviors when motivated by intrasexual rather than intersexual
competition. However, the same effect was not expected from women because men are more
likely to experience sexual selection pressures than women are (Archer, 2009; Buss, 1989;
Daly and Wilson, 1988; Miller, 2000; Puts, 2010). Intersexual and intrasexual selection were
manipulated during a simulated dating game, and creativity and aggression tasks were used
to represent ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors, respectively.
Materials and Methods
The sample consisted of 132 Chinese undergraduate students (average age = 20.11
years, SD = 1.01; 66 men) who received a moderate monetary incentive for their
participation. A 2 (participant gender) x 3 (sexual selection situations: intersexual vs.
intrasexual vs. control, between participants) x 2 (mating strategies: creativity vs. aggression,
within participants) mixed design was used.
The participants were randomly assigned to intersexual, intrasexual selection, or
control conditions. After arriving at the laboratory, the male participants were shown a
photograph of an attractive woman, which was pre-rated by an independent group of judges,
and told that they may be selected to participate in a dating game with that woman based on
their performance in two subsequent tasks. In the intersexual selection condition, the male
participant was told that the woman in the photograph would evaluate his task performance
and select her dating game partner. In the intrasexual selection condition, the male participant
was told that his performance would be evaluated by other male participants in selecting the
dating game partner. The female participants were shown a photograph of an attractive man
and given either one of the same two types of instructions for playing the dating game with
that man. After being prepared for intrasexual or intersexual selection conditions, the
participants were assigned creativity (category inclusion) and aggression (competitive
reaction time) tasks. Half of the participants completed the category inclusion task first,
followed by the competitive reaction time task and vice versa for the other half of the
participants. After completing the tasks, the participants answered four questions addressing
their positive and negative mood by using a 9-point scale (two items for each mood;
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -270-
Griskevicius et al., 2009). Finally, they were thanked and debriefed. The control group,
which received no mating instructions, simply participated in the creativity and aggression
tasks. Their performances served as a baseline to confirm that the expected differences
between the intrasexual and intersexual groups were obtained because the hypothesized
group exhibited a superior performance, but not because the opposite group exhibited an
inferior performance compared with the control group.
Creativity task
Creative performance was measured using a category inclusion task (Isen and
Daubman, 1984) that has been widely used in creativity research (e.g., De Dreu and Nijstad,
2008; Friedman and Forster, 2000). This task is used to test cognitive flexibility and
ideational originality based on the breadth of inclusion of items atypical of a category
(Murray, Sujan, Hirt, and Sujan, 1990) and has been found to correlate with associative
thoughts, cognitive flexibility, and originality of ideas (Gasper and Middlewood, 2014;
Miron-Spektor, Gino, and Argote, 2011; Nijstad, De Dreu, Rietzschel, and Baas, 2010). The
participants were given three categories (furniture, vegetables, and clothing), each containing
nine exemplar items. Three of these items were strong exemplars, three were moderate
exemplars, and three were poor exemplars of the category. The nine items within each
category were individually presented in a fixed order that differed in typicality from most
(e.g., sofa for the furniture category), to moderately (e.g., bookcase for the furniture
category), to least typical (e.g., telephone for the furniture category). The participants
indicated how typical each item was for the named category on a 10-point scale ranging from
1 (atypical) to 10 (typical). Using highly and moderately typical exemplars (e.g., sofa and
bookcase for the furniture category) as representatives of a category is not presumed to
require cognitive flexibility (Isen and Daubman, 1984) because such exemplars clearly
belong to a specific category. Using atypical exemplars (e.g., telephone) in the category
requires seeing these exemplars in unusual ways. Therefore, the extent to which these
exemplars are used reflects cognitive flexibility and creativity. Based on relevant literature
(Carnevale and Probst, 1998; Friedman and Forster, 2000; Isen and Daubman, 1984) we
aggregated the typicality ratings of the nine atypical exemplars for each category, forming a
creativity index. The internal consistency reliability estimate was .75.
Aggression task
Each participant played the competitive reaction time game (e.g., Bushman, 2002),
ostensibly against a same-sex competitor who was sitting inside a cubicle opposite the
participant. Although the participants assumed they played against same-sex players, they
played against a computer programmed to mimic their responses. The participant pressed a
button as fast as possible during a series of trials, expecting to receive or send a blast of white
noise based on which player ­ the participant or his opponent, responded slower. Before
beginning the game, the participants determined the intensity level (ranging between 60
decibels [Level 1] and 105 decibels [Level 10]) and duration (ranging from 0.5 seconds
[Level 1] to 5 seconds [Level 10]) of white noise that their opponent would experience when
reacting slower compared with the participant. A nonaggressive no-noise option (0 decibels)
was also offered. Thus, the participants were provided "weapons" to inflict pain on same-sex
competitors.
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -271-
The task comprised nine trials, and the initial trial was not provoked. The participant
heard noises during half of the trials (randomly determined). Previous studies (e.g., Bushman
and Baumeister, 1998; Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, and Stucke, 2001) have shown that the
first trial yields the optimal measure of unprovoked aggression because the participants have
not yet experienced aversive blasts of white noise from the opponent. Based on this literature,
we used the blast intensity and duration selected in the first trial as measures of aggression.
The two variables (intensity and duration) were converted into z-scores and summed to
generate a composite aggression score.
Results and Discussion
No statistical differences existed between the intrasexual and intersexual selection
conditions regarding positive (F[1, 86] = 1.24, p = .27) or negative mood states (F[1, 84] =
0.36, p = .55). This suggests that the aggression derived from intrasexual competition is not
associated with negative arousal (i.e., anger and frustration).
Consistent with predictions, an ANOVA of the 2 (participant gender) x 3 (intersexual
selection vs. intrasexual selection vs. control) x 2 (creativity vs. aggression) mixed design
yielded a significant three-way interaction (F[2, 126] = 3.13, p < .001, 2 = .05). To examine
the specific study hypotheses, we performed a series of planned comparisons of creativity
and aggression (Figure 1).

Regarding creativity, we predicted that intersexual selection motives would enhance
male creativity. The men in the intersexual selection condition exhibited higher creativity
levels (M = 5.09, SD = 1.42) than did those in the intrasexual (M = 4.11, SD = 1.19; t[63] =
2.27, p = .03, d = 0.77) and control conditions (M = 3.98, SD =1.67; t[63] = 2.55, p = .01, d
= 0.73). There was no difference between the intrasexual and control conditions (t[63] = 0.28,
p = .78). The female participants exhibited no differences regarding creativity levels between
the intersexual (M = 4.05, SD = 2.16) and intrasexual selection conditions (M = 4.04, SD =
1.62; t[63] = 0.02, p = .99), between the intersexual and control conditions (M = 4.03, SD =
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -272-
1.41; t[63] = 0.03, p = .98), and between the intrasexual and control conditions (t[63] = 0.01,
p = .99).
Concerning aggression, we predicted that intrasexual selection motives would
enhance male aggression. The men in the intrasexual selection condition exhibited higher
aggression levels (M = 1.68, SD = 2.32) than did those in the intersexual (M = 0.28, SD =
2.48; t[63] = 2.17, p = .03, d = 0.60) and control conditions (M = -0.02, SD = 1.52; t[63] =
2.63, p = .01, d = 0.89). There was no difference between the intersexual and control
conditions (t[63] = 0.46, p = .65). The women exhibited no differences regarding aggression
levels between the intrasexual (M = -.73, SD = 1.33) and intersexual selection conditions (M
= -.54, SD = 1.35; t[63] = .49, p = .63), between intrasexual and control conditions (M = -
.67, SD = 1.12; t[63] = -0.17, p = .87), or between intersexual and control conditions (t[63]
= 0.32, p = .75). These results suggest that, as explicated by sexual selection theory,
intersexual and intrasexual selection conditions elicit distinct male mating strategies. Similar
to other animals that specialize in ornamental or weapon strategies, men respond to the two
sexual selections by exhibiting corresponding ornament-like and weapon-like behaviors.
Study 2
In Study 1, one photograph of an attractive person of the opposite sex was used to
establish mating motivation. Although a single photograph has been widely used (e.g., Baker
and Maner, 2009), allowing the participants to choose from multiple photographs may more
effectively activate mating motivation. Thus, in Study 2, the participants chose their mates.
We also altered the intrasexual and intersexual selection manipulations by asking the
participants to imagine real dating situations. The same aggression task was used as in Study
1, but a different creativity task was used that relies on independent judges to assess the
originality of novel ideas. We also eliminated the control group and only compared
intrasexual with intersexual conditions because Study 1 had already shown that the expected
change in aggression and creativity was due to the relevant experimental groups. With these
changes, we expected Study 2 to replicate the results of Study 1.
Materials and Methods
The sample consisted of 100 Chinese undergraduate students (average age = 20.37
years, SD = 0.86; 50 men) who received a moderate payment for their participation.
After arriving at the laboratory, the participants viewed a computer screen that
displayed photographs of 10 attractive members of the opposite sex. They chose one person
whose photograph was displayed onscreen and were asked to imagine romantically pursuing
this person. In the intersexual condition, the male participants were told that the woman had
other male suitors and that she would decide whom to date after reviewing how the
participants performed in two subsequent tasks. In the intrasexual selection condition, the
male participants were told that they and other male suitors would decide who would date
the chosen woman after completing two tasks. The female participants were given the same
instructions regarding male targets and female suitors. After the sexual selection
manipulation, the participants completed the aggression and creativity tasks in a
counterbalanced order. Finally, the participants completed the four mood state questions.
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -273-
The experiment design was a 2 (participant gender) x 2 (sexual selection situations:
intersexual vs. intrasexual) x 2 (mating strategies: creativity vs. aggression) mixed-factorial
design. Gender and selection situation were the between-participants factors and mating
strategy was a within-participant factor.
The Unusual Uses Task (Friedman and Forster, 2000) was implemented as the
creativity measure in Study 2. During this task, the participants listed as many creative uses
of a tin can as possible in 1 minute. This yielded 130 unique uses, which four independent
judges rated for originality by using a 9-point scale. The interrater reliability was .86. The
creativity score represented the average originality rating for all uses proposed by a
participant.
Results and Discussion
No statistical differences existed between the intrasexual and intersexual selection
conditions regarding positive (F[1, 98] = 0.16, p = .69) or negative mood states (F[1, 98] =
1.66, p = .20). An ANOVA of the 2 (participant gender) x 2 (intrasexual vs. intersexual
selection conditions, between participants) x 2 (creativity, aggression, within participants)
mixed design exhibited a significant three-way interaction (F[1, 96] = 5.26, p = .02, 2 = .05).
The results are shown in Figure 2. Men in the intersexual selection condition demonstrated
higher originality levels (M = 4.45, SD = 1.26) than men in the intrasexual selection condition
did (M = 3.84, SD = 0.82; t[48] = 2.01, p = .05, d = 0.58), whereas men in the intrasexual
selection condition showed higher aggression levels (M = 1.53, SD = 2.26) than men in the
intersexual selection condition did (M = -0.11, SD = 1.76; t[48] = -2.86, p = .006, d = 0.83).
Figure 2. Intersexual and intrasexual effect on creativity and aggression in Study 2
Note. Error bars indicate ± SE
Regarding the female participants, there were no significant differences in creativity
between intersexual (M = 4.59, SD = 1.33) and intrasexual conditions (M = 4.36, SD = 1.12,
t [48] = 0. 67, p = .51), and there were no significant differences in aggression between
intersexual (M = -0.80, SD = 1.28) and intrasexual conditions (M = -0.63, SD = 1.31; t[48] =
-0.45, p = .65). These results replicate those of Study 1, supporting the hypothesis that, in
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament

men but not women, intersexual selection yielded ideational originality (an ornamental
display) and intrasexual selection yielded aggression (a weapon-like behavior).
Study 3
The first two studies showed that male behavioral response to intrasexual and
intersexual selection pressures was weapon-like (e.g., aggressive) or ornament-like (e.g.,
creative). Over time, varying environmental pressures can select people who specialize in
one survival and reproductive strategy slightly more compared with others, generating
personality and individual differences (Tooby and Cosmides, 1990). In this study, we
examined how individual differences among men regarding aggression and creativity were
associated with the ways by which men respond to intrasexual and intersexual mating
competition. We developed a questionnaire to measure male preferences regarding using
intrasexual competition or intersexual courtship to compete for mates. We hypothesized that
creative men would engage in intersexual courtship more than aggressive men would,
whereas aggressive men would engage in intrasexual competition more than creative men
would.
Materials and Methods
Participants and procedures
Because sexual selection conditions yielded no effect on female mating behaviors in
Studies 1 and 2, only Chinese male university students participated in Study 3 (n = 118;
average age = 19.39 years, SD = 1.25). The participants were asked about their current partner
status, completed a short questionnaire, and were assured of their confidentiality and
anonymity. Forty percent of the participants were currently in a romantic relationship.
Measures
Creative personality was measured using the Creative Personality Scale (CPS)
developed by Gough (1979). It comprises 20 adjectives that are self-rated on a 5-point Likert-
type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Sample items included
"insightful," "inventive," and "conventional" (reverse-coded). As a measure of creative
personality, the CPS has been shown to relate to other-rated creativity (e.g., Silvia, Wigert,
Reiter-Palmon, and Kaufman, 2012). The internal consistency reliability estimate was .76.
Aggressive personality was assessed using the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire
(Buss and Perry, 1992). The questionnaire comprises 29 items, forming four subscales:
physical aggression (e.g., "I have threatened people I know"), verbal aggression (e.g., "I
often find myself disagreeing with people"), anger (e.g., "I have difficulty controlling my
temper"), and hostility (e.g., "I know that my `friends' talk about me behind my back"). The
participants evaluated the extent to which these statements were characteristic or
uncharacteristic of themselves, using a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (extremely
uncharacteristic of me) to 5 (extremely characteristic of me). Based on the original intention
of the scale, a general trait aggression score was calculated by averaging the scores across all
items. The internal consistency reliability estimate was .84.
We developed a 26-item questionnaire in Chinese, the Men's Mating Strategy Scale,
to measure male preferences for using intrasexual or intersexual mating strategies. By using
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -275-
a 6-point scale ranging from most unlikely to most likely, the men indicated what they would
do to pursue their mate choice. Twelve questions represented intersexual courtship (e.g., "I
would appeal to her;" "I would work hard to show her that I am worth her love") and 14
questions represented intrasexual competition (e.g., "I would prevent other men from getting
too close to her;" "I would make sure I am respected by other guys in front of my girl"). A
principle component factor analysis using eigenvalues larger than 1.0 extracted two factors
corresponding to intersexual courtship and intrasexual competition. The two factors
accounted for 53.33% of the variance. Factor loadings ranged between .56 and .83. The
English translation of the Chinese items and factor loadings are reported in Appendix 1. We
averaged the relevant items to form the two mating strategy variables. The internal
consistency reliability estimates were .89 for intersexual courtship and .93 for intrasexual
competition.
Results and Discussion
We conducted multiple regression analyses using each of the two mating strategies
as a dependent variable and using, by simultaneous entry, age, partner status, and creative
and aggressive personality as predictors. To exclude the possible effect of an interaction
between creativity and aggression, we generated an interaction term by multiplying the
standardized aggression and creativity scores and entering the interaction variable in the
regression. Table 1 lists the results of these analyses.

was positively related to intersexual courtship. The results in the right column of Table 1
showed that aggression, but not creativity, was positively related to intrasexual competition.
The interaction between creativity and aggression did not predict intersexual courtship or
intrasexual competition. These results support the hypothesis that creative men were more
likely to use intersexual courtship, whereas aggressive men were more likely to exhibit
intrasexual competition, suggesting that individual differences in creativity and aggression

as personality traits may also have been shaped by sexual selection in response to intersexual
and intrasexual competitions. Finally, the correlation between intersexual courtship and
intrasexual competition was .21. Like other weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors, these
mating strategies or styles are distinct, but they also show moderate overlapping, reflecting
an overall mating motivation as well as the possibility that some ornaments may have been
derived from weapons (Puts, 2010).
General Discussion
We tested the hypothesis that men respond to intersexual and intrasexual selection by
performing weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors, respectively. This facultative response
of men contrasts with other male animals that specialize either in weapons or ornaments as
nearly exclusive mating strategies. The findings obtained by manipulating the modes of
sexual selection in Studies 1 and 2 yielded converging support for the prediction that men
would respond to intrasexual selection with elevated aggression and to intersexual selection
with enhanced creativity. During the simulated dating games, male aggression, but not
creativity, was elevated when the right to date a mate was decided by other male suitors. By
contrast, an elevated level of creativity, but not aggression, was exhibited when the female
dating targets chose a suitor. Thus, men facultatively employ weapons or ornaments as a
mating strategy based on situational demands. Similarly, we showed in Study 3 that
individual differences in creativity and aggression as personality traits were also associated
with men's mating strategies. Based on the mating strategy questionnaire, aggression
significantly predicted a preference for intrasexual mating strategies and creativity
significantly predicted a preference for intersexual mating strategies. These findings suggest
that intersexual and intrasexual selection pressure over time may select some men to
specialize in one reproductive strategy slightly more compared to other men, adding to the
vast personality and individual differences along a weapon-ornament dimension.
Although some of these findings seem self-evident within the framework of sexual
selection theory, this research is among the first to empirically manipulate both intersexual
and intrasexual selection conditions to study the corresponding weapon-like and ornament-
like behaviors. The findings confirm the power of sexual selection, which has shaped most
animal species, including currently monogamous species such as human beings, after
millions of years of intrasexual and intersexual competition. Because of a large brain and
parental investment, monogamous human males do not show the same level of biological
intensity in building and using weapons or ornaments compared with certain polygynous
male animals. However, humans compensate for a lack of biological enhancements with
extended phenotypes. Weapons and ornaments are extended throughout human culture in
wars and the military (Chang et al., 2011) and in art, music, and literature (Miller, 2000).
Employing these culturally extended weapons and ornaments is also facultative. Men's
artistic creativity was shown to increase when performing for women compared with men
(Griskevicius, Cialdini, et al., 2006). Preindustrial tribesmen fought wars to compete for
women (Manson and Wrangham, 1991), and such competitions continued within the
contemporary military (Nikoli-Ristanovi, 2000). Culturally extended weapons and
ornaments are also widely depicted in literary works and are often embodied in the lives of
their writers. A fitting example is the 19th century Russian poet, Pushkin, who wrote
numerous notable poems (ornaments) and fought and died in a duel (weapons) for the love
Creativity and aggression as ornament and armament

of women. More often, however, are warriors and poets "played out" by disparate men,
representing personality differences in using weapons and ornaments. Large human brains
enable humans to amass and culturally extend a substantial repertoire of survival and
reproductive strategies, including weapons and ornaments. Thus, humans are facultative and
flexible, using various strategies to solve specific survival and reproductive challenges, and
displaying substantial personality and individual differences when selecting relevant
strategies.
Several limitations affected the present study. First, the developed mating strategy
questionnaire used in Study 3 lacked sufficient evidence of validity. We conducted focus
groups to determine items for inclusion and conducted a factor analysis to confirm that these
items conformed to the expected two-factor structure. However, the questionnaire was not
correlated with other constructs to provide external, rather than merely internal, evidence of
construct validity. Second, we used a between-subjects design to manipulate the intrasexual
and intersexual selection conditions among two groups of men. Future studies should use a
within-subjects design to examine how a single group of male participants facultatively
switches between weapons and ornaments. Third, we used aggression and creativity to
represent weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors. Because our aggression task involved
blasting white noise against a same-gender opponent, using such a task as the dependent
variable could introduce an additional intrasexual competition component that was not
counterbalanced by an additional intersexual component with the creativity task. Future
research could use other weapon-like variables that do not directly involve intrasexual
competition.
Finally, we conceptualized that male ornaments arise from female choice and do not
serve adaptive functions other than attracting females, and that male weapons originate from
male-male competition. This is typically consistent with sexual selection theory. However,
some human ornamental traits such as creativity, sense of humor, and risk taking do serve
adaptive functions other than attracting mates (Fessler, Tiokhin, Holbrook, Gervais, and
Snyder, 2014; Li et al., 2009), and the mate choices of women seem to exceed merely
superior genes or ornaments. They also include weapon-like attributes such as dominance
and competence (Valentine et al., 2014) derived from intrasexual competition, as well as
fatherly qualities such as loving and being kind (Li, Valentine, and Patel, 2011; Low, 2005;
Lu, Zhu, and Chang, in press). There is also evidence suggesting that ancestral and modern
humans have substantial weapon-based sexual dimorphism (Lassek and Gaulin, 2009), that
male contest competition rather than female choice or sperm competition was the primary
mechanism driving male mating competition over human evolution (Puts, 2010), and that
some ornaments may have initially been selected through intrasexual combat but later
became used as ornaments because fighting prowess indicates male condition to both sexes
(Berglund et al., 1996). However, a discussion of the origins of human mating is beyond the
scope of the present study, which is based on the simpler premise that the large human brain
enables extraordinary versatility for acquiring and employing varieties of survival and
reproductive strategies including weapons and ornaments. Despite these limitations, this
study is among the first to manipulate both intersexual and intrasexual selection conditions
to study how they affect weapon-like and ornament-like behaviors among men. It is also one
of the few studies of human mating competition not conducted on a Western, educated,
industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) population (Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan,
2010), which is especially needed to test pan-cultural evolutionary predictions. The results

showed that, similar to other male animals, men both show off using conspicuous social
ornaments (e.g., creativity) to appeal to potential mates, and arm themselves using aggression
to compete with male suitors.
