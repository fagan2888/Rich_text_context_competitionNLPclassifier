The interdisciplinary field of emotion studies ignores the his-
torical perspective on translation problems. In today's scientific
publications, which are predominantly written in English, the
term "emotion" is used as if it were synonymous in all lan-
guages, times, and contexts. Although the semantic fields of
emotion terms are not identical in English, French, and German,
these three languages informed the study of emotion in 19th-
century psychology, at the time when the scientific concept of
emotion was formed. Furthermore, the French émotion and the
English emotion have become homonyms, sentiment and senti-
ment are not used in the same way, and Affekt also poses a prob-
lem. Translation problems have masked the epistemological
problems that German and French psychologists in the 19th
century were studying when they addressed the question of
"emotion" for contemporary Anglophone psychologists and
historians of emotion. Problems of translation occur on many
levels. Here I am particularly concerned with two aspects, one
is the historical authors' reading of each other and writing about
the same topic in a different language (applying their respective
backgrounds to their readings); and, the second is contemporary
scientists and historians'reading of historical and contemporary
texts on emotion, applying the current connotation of emotion.
That translation or cross-linguistic differences represent a
problem or a challenge for emotion studies has been addressed
by linguists, such as Wierzbicka (Imprisoned in English, 2014),
by Mandler (Mind and Emotion, 1975), for psychology, and by
Cassin (Vocabulaire européen des philosophies: dictionnaire
des intraduisibles, 2004), for philosophy. The German terms
Gefühl and Empfindung are part of the collection of terms which
philosophers in earlier times transcribed in the original language
without translating them. In this article, I adopt the same strat-
egy in order to call attention to the non-Anglophone connota-
tions that informed the scientific concept of "emotion" at its
inception. The problem is particularly relevant at a moment
when all scientific work has to be published in English in order
to count. Montgomery (2013) points out that "MostAnglophone
researchers are monolingual and cite only papers in English"
(p. 105). While for him English is beneficial to science because
now scientists are finally able to "communicate directly with
each other," linguists stress what is lost through the
Anglocentrism that dominates humanist scholarship.Wierzbicka
(2014) holds that "every language equips its speakers with a
particular set of cognitive tools for seeing and interpreting the
world" (p. 3). The Anglocentric frame creates a conceptual cage

Abstract
The interdisciplinary field of emotion studies disregarded historical perspectives on translation and left out a substantial body of
scientific research on feelings and emotions that was not published in English. Yet these texts were foundational in forging the
scientific concept of emotion in experimental psychology in the 19th century. The current approach to emotion science overlooks
that translation issues occurred between three languages, German, French, and English, as physiological psychologists at the time
were reading each other in these languages all the while writing about the same topics in their respective language. Historical
perspectives are important to clarify the ambiguities of emotion terms and include non-Anglophone frameworks into current
transdisciplinary debates.

that "can blind us to the world as it presents itself to other peo-
ple" (p. 4). Indeed, not only are non-English frames absent from
current accounts on emotions in psychology, but 19th-century
psychology is invisible to scholars today, who are studying
questions concerning emotion and cognition that psychologists
already once raised (Farrell, 2014). Contemporary textbooks of
emotion (Fox, 2008), scientific accounts (Damasio, 1999), and
histories of emotion (Dixon, 2003), to give some representative
examples, cite Darwin and James as the relevant historical
authorities for emotion.
What I want to point out here is that the German origins of
psychophysiology are key for the understanding of "emotion"
in scientific texts. Part of the definitional issues on the nature of
emotion that arose in the late 19th century and are hotly debated
again a century later, are related to issues of translation from
German to French to English, and English to French by the
19th-century psychologists. Beginning with the work of
Wilhelm Wundt (1832­1920), who wrote in German (1863,
1874); Théodule Ribot (1839­1916), who read him and wrote
in French (1873, 1881, 1896); and lastly, William James (1842­
1910), who read both authors and wrote in English (1884,
1890), to put it briefly. The relevant source for the "concept of
emotion" in psychology, and also in Anglophone psychology,
was German and French scientific psychology (Clarke &
Jacyna, 1987). In the 19th century, students from all over the
world flocked to Germany in order to train in the new disci-
pline of experimental psychology (Boring, 1950; Bringmann &
Tweney, 1980). At the ground of what is discussed in today's
research on emotion lies the question of the German Gefühl, its
nature and role in cognition. Wundt in particular detailed on
many accounts how Gefühl might be created in the brain, how
it might influence processes of cognition, and how it might
come to conscious awareness (for instance, Wundt, 1902­1903,
Vol. 2, p. 357, Vol. 3, pp. 121­122). His argument went far
beyond John Stuart Mill's associationism (Fahrenberg, 2011).
For reading the German scientific texts, the French meaning of
émotion rather than the contemporary English meaning of
"emotion" must be taken as the basis. Émotion and emotion
were once used as synonyms, as can be seen in the writings of
Hume and in language dictionaries from then 1880s, however,
they no longer are so.
Pernau (2012) highlights that languages are no "naturally
given entities" but are created by the historical exchanges of the
actors that use them, adding new meanings and incorporating
nonnative elements. Today, the conventional use of the English
"emotion" in colloquial contexts immediately prompts the asso-
ciation of love and hate and, in scientific contexts, of the six
"basic emotions," happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and
surprise, which are often treated like a fixed entity. Much schol-
arly ink is spilled over the existence of basic emotions, defini-
tions, classification, expression, and cultural specificity. (See
the discussion in the special section on Defining Emotion in
Emotion Review, 2012.) The medical literature uses the term
emotion often in a generic sense, connoting feeling, basic
arousal, unconscious processing, or emotional processing in the
nervous system (Hillman, 1960). This is closer to the use that
German psychophysiologists made of Gefühl and which was
translated as emotion.
Historians who alerted to the role of language in a "science
of emotion" left out the perspectives of the German psycho-
physiologists (Evans, 2001; Majid, 2012). As Majid put it,
Dixon "very nicely illustrates" that,
[T]he definitional criteria of the term emotion in English has changed in
historical time and was, in part, originally defined by the concerns of
scientists. However, contemporary usage of emotion by English
speakers doesn't always correspond to the myriad scientific
terminologies. (2012, p. 380)
Historians of emotions began analyzing the shifting emotional
vocabulary from 1800 to 2000 based on German and British
encyclopedia entries (Scheer et al., 2014) but did not include
scientific texts, nor did they consider the issue of translation
between German, French, and English in the 19th century.
Linguists seek nonethnocentric ways for analyzing language in
order to get out of the conceptual cage that the English language
represents, because it is taken as the "standard in relation to
which all other languages and cultures can be analyzed and
interpreted" (Wierzbicka, 2014, p. 3). Wierzbicka (2009) argues
that a natural semantic metalanguage (NSM) can free us from
conventions of speaking and framing things in the historically
shaped conceptual vocabulary of English. Fabrega (2012, p.
318) assumes that such a theory of arguably "self-evident, self-
explanatory concepts which all natural languages build on" rep-
resents the key for understanding, for instance, how humans
were able to develop communication about their pain. Goddard
(2014) suggests that the NSM also allows including the study of
vocal interjections in the analysis of emotions, as they convey
emotional meaning. The aim of the scientific work in experi-
mental psychology in the 19th century was to go beyond the
alleged self-evidence of Gefühl, Empfindung, feeling, thinking,
and perceiving.
In the following lines, I turn to the conceptual distinctions
made by 19th-century psychologists. First, I show how German
psychology in the 19th century reflected on the use of emotion
terms such as Gefühl, Empfindung, and Affekt. Then I turn to the
uses of émotion and emotion, and sentiment and sentiment in
historical French dictionaries and in translations to illustrate the
semantic field and problem set that experimental psychologists
addressed. Concluding I hope to show that the historical diagno-
sis of contemporary psychology's ills is incomplete and even
misleading, when it leaves out the non-Anglophone scientific
texts that provided the basis for the contemporary concept of
emotion in experimental psychology.
While in the British case, as Dixon (2003) argued, a new
term was introduced, emotion replaced passion, in the German
case the terms Gefühl, Empfindung, Affect, and Leidenschaft
remained, but the ways in which they were used in psychology
shifted from the 18th to the 19th century. Wundt (1891, 1900)
reviewed the shifting meanings of emotion terms in philosophy,
literature, and psychology in two articles in 1891 and 1900.
In his chronology of the psychology of emotions he noted that
German philosophy from Christian Wolff to Kant was the
Wassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 165
precursor of the psychology of his day (Wundt, 1913, p. 167).
Since the 17th century, several Gefühle had been described in
considerable detail, but ethical considerations, questions of
logic, and practical considerations were always admixed in the
psychological reflection. According to his analysis of
Gefühlspsychologie, the psychology of emotion began with
Aristotle's Nichomachean Ethics, which remained a canonical
text that was still highly influential in the 18th century. At the
turn of the 19th century, Kant's Anthropologie in pragmatischer
Hinsicht (1880) and Maas's Versuch über die Leidenschaften
(1805­1807) took the lead in the psychology of emotions. At
that time, the terms Gemüth (mind), Seele (soul), Geist (spirit),
and Bewusstsein (consciousness) were used indiscriminately.
Kant used the notion of "Vorstellungen, die im Gemüth woh-
nen," ideas that live in the mind. The distinction between
Gemüth and Geist (mind vs. spirit) was introduced by Johann
Gottlieb Fichte (1808). The romantic literature established the
term Gefühl, differentiating more passive and more active or
lasting aspects of emotions. Gefühl was linked to specific ideas;
it "excited" but did not yet "move" the Gemüth into action.
Gefühl was an excitation that remained on the surface. Gefühl
was part of--but not equivalent to--motivation, desire, and
action. "Eine Gemüthserregung, welche nicht das ganz Gemüth
ergreift, sondern an einzelne Vorstellungen gebunden, gewisser-
massen an der Oberfläche desselben bleibt, eine Erregung, aber
noch keine Bewegung des Gemüths ist" (Wundt, 1891, p. 337).
In contrast to Gefühl stood Leidenschaft, which signified a last-
ing orientation of Gemüth in a particular direction--an inclina-
tion towards one specific form of pleasure or one particular
pain, a single specific activity that the mind could not direct its
attention away from. Johann Friedrich Herbart (1776­1841)
was the first to analyze the psychic processes of Gefühl in their
own right and strictly from a psychological point of view.
The evolution of the usage of emotion terms was prefigured
by the Latin term "affectus," which signified a mighty but pass-
ing excitation, "heftige Gemüthserregung oder ein Begehren
von qualitativ unbestimmter Natur," a strong movement of the
mind or a desire of qualitative indistinct nature, whereas passio
implied the suffering condition of body or soul, which was
something lasting (Wundt 1891, p. 340). As Wundt saw it, the
term Leidenschaft was introduced into German in the late 17th
century in translation of Descartes' Passion de l'âme. Indeed,
the evolution of meaning of the terms Affect and Leidenschaft
was entirely due to Descartes, who called attention "to the active
part in suffering" (Wundt, 1891, p. 339). For Descartes, every
suffering could be considered an "action" because it required an
acting person. De Spinoza (1981, Part III, Def. 3) used Affect as
a general term and distinguished between active and passive
suffering, Affecte oder Leidenschaften. This distinction disap-
peared in German philosophy until Kant reintroduced it when
he theorized on the development and duration of the affection
(Wundt, 1891, p. 340). In Kant's (1838) definition, Leidenschaft
became a "lasting inclination," a tendency to (re)act that was
hard to overcome through rational deliberation, "eine durch die
Vernunft des Subjects schwer oder gar nicht bezwingliche
Neigung" (1838, p. 170). In contrast, Affect was a spontaneous
impulse, an emotion or feeling of a pleasure or a pain "in the
present," which did not prompt the individual to reflect on
whether it was right or wrong to give in to it in the heat of the
moment, "das Gefühl einer Lust oder Unlust im gegenwärtigen
Zustand, welches im Subject die Ueberlegung...nicht aufkom-
men laest" (Kant, 1838, p. 170). Thus, Kant spoke of
Leidenschaften as "diseases of the soul/mind" (Kant, 1838, p.
170) Krankheiten des Gemüths. The notion is retained particu-
larly in Affekthandlung, crime of passion. Reflection on long-
term outcomes is not invited when in the grip of strong emotions.
Kant's point is consistent with the French dictionaries' idea that
sentiment is stronger than mere thought. The dictionaries
expressed what still holds true today: people are strongly con-
vinced that what they "feel" is true, much more strongly than
what they merely guess or voice an opinion about.
Nineteenth-century psychology retained solely the temporal
distinction in Kant's definition; namely, Affect was a "passing
excitation," "vorrübergehende Gemüthsbewegung" (Wund,
1891, p. 340) whereas Leidenschaft was a "lasting orientation"
of the psyche, dauernde Gemüthsausrichtung (Wundt, 1891,
p. 341). Psychology abandoned the pathological connotation of
Leidenschaft; it no longer spoke of Leidenschaften as diseases
of the mind. In this use of the term, "scientific psychology"
returned to the way Leidenschaft had been used in the romantic
literature in the 18th century, where it stood for both positive
and negative passions (Wundt, 1891, p. 341). Leidenschaft was
not, however, included in the psychophysiological analysis of
Gefühl, because it was considered a special case and not part of
the fundamental principles of cognition.
Gefühl and Empfindung
The terms Gefühl and Empfindung, emotion and sensation, were
used as follows: Empfindung was seen as the more internal, the
innermost self, das mehr Innerliche und Subjective, whereas
Gefühl was seen as the more objective and external, das
Aeusserliche und Objective. The sense of touch, Tastsinn, was
called Gefühlssinn, feeling sense. The excitation of the senses of
hearing and seeing were called sensations, Empfindungen.
However, as Wundt pointed out, psychological language in the
19th century inverted the meaning of Gefühl and Emfindung:
what was called fühlen at the beginning of the century was
called empfinden at the end of the century, and vice versa. The
way in which psychology at the end of the 19th century used
fühlen and empfinden would be this, "We perceive it as green,
we feel it as pleasurable," Wir empfinden es grün, und wir füh-
len es angenehm. In his monograph about the bodily expres-
sions of psychic states, Über die körperlichen Äusserungen
psychischer Zustände, the German neurologist Berger (1904)
noted the inverted use of the terms Empfindung und Gefühl that
the physiological and the psychological literature of his time
was making.
Empfindung designated each and every qualitative excitation
of consciousness (conscious awareness), Erregung des
Bewusstseins, which could become part of objective ideas. For
instance, when taken in isolation color, warmth, and a simple
166 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 2
sound were sensations, Empfindungen. The subjective reaction
to color, warmth, or sound, however, was Gefühl. One should
add that "objective" and "subjective" were used in a value-free
manner. Objective simply meant having an object to which a
change of state that the brain perceived was causally attributa-
ble. For instance, when the grass turns black as the sun goes
down, the cause lies outside of us. When we feel a tooth ache,
the cause lies in us.
Gefühl was subjective because the cause of the perceived
change laid inside of us. In Wundt's view Gefühl was a judg-
ment with relation to us. It was a mode of thought, a quality of
conscious awareness which was tied to central nervous process-
ing, an bestimmte centrale Gehirnvorgänge gebundene
Bewusstseinsqualitäten (Wundt, 1902­1903, Vol. 2, p. 357).
Gefühl expressed our inner attitude to external excitations,
thoughts, or memories. Wundt pointed out that the emotion
terms were used differently in different realms, scientific and
esthetic. In particular, in the field of aesthetics the terms
Empfindung and Gefühl were still used indiscriminately, and in
the same way as they had been used in psychology at the begin-
ning of the 19th century (Wundt, 1891, p. 338). In the artistic
domain, Empfindung designated the most ethereal sentiment,
whereas in the medical literature, the same term designated the
most primitive visceral sensation.
The problem is still with us today. Different connotations of
Empfindung are evoked in the medical disciplines and humani-
ties. This causes misunderstandings in transdisciplinary debates.
Contemporary biomedical literature (Hüther, 2010) conceptual-
izes the "emotional-cognitive" development as linked and clas-
sifies brain processes in hierarchical order from bottom up,
from simple to most complex: Körperzustand, Emotion, Gefühl,
Empfindung, body state, emotion, feeling, sentiment.
Empfindung is placed at the very top (2010, p. 15).1 Whereas in
the 19th-century psychophysiological literature, Empfindung
was situated at the bottom, on the same plane as sinnliche
Gefühle, sense feelings, followed by Affekte (Wundt, 1863,
1874, 1902­1903). Placed at the top of the hierarchy were
"higher order emotions" and concepts, höhere Gefühle and
Begriffe, characterized by increasing complexity and intellec-
tual content.
Gefühl and Affekt
Different disciplines also use the term Affekt in different ways.
The sociological literature (Scheler, 1923; Simmel, 1896) privi-
leges Affekt(e) over Gefühl in contrast to the psycho-medical
literature. Contemporary German historians of emotion also
privilege the term Affekt, as do some Anglophone psychologists
(Barrett & Bliss-Moreau, 2009; Fox, 2008), who suggest using
of "affect" instead of emotion. However, the term Affect too was
used in contradictory ways in the psychological literature of the
19th century. (After 1900 the German spelling was Affekt). For
instance, in Das menschliche Gefühlsleben, Nahlowsky (1862,
p. 214) argued that Gefühle originated in Affect, whereas Wundt
in Vorlesungen über die Menschen- und Thierseele (1863)
argued that Affect originated in Gefühl, emotion. In Wundt's
definition, Affect was the more complex configuration, a com-
pound of emotion (feeling), thought content, motivation, and
tendency to act, in contrast to simple "sensory emotion" or
sense feelings, sinnliche Gefühle. Finally, Carl Georg Lange
(1887), in his monograph Über Gemüthsbewegungen, used
Affect for simple emotion, such as a startle, and at other times
also for (what Wundt called) complex higher order emotions,
such as anger and happiness. In Lange's account, startle, anger,
and happiness, Schreck, Wuth, Freude were "einfache Affecte"
simple emotions. He argued that these einfache Affecte should
be analytically separated from the more complex emotional
conditions "complexe Gemüthszustände," such as envy, love,
and admiration, Neid, Liebe, Bewunderung. The former should
be called Affect or Gemüthsbewegungen, the latter Gefühle.
Here, Gefühle would correspond to sentiment. However, this
classification was not followed in psychology. When Wundt
(1887) commented on the different usages of the term Affect in
the psychological literature in his discussion of the James­
Lange theory of emotion he held: "What is usually taken to be
the relation between Gefühl and Affect is turned upside down [in
Lange's work]. The Affect is defined as the simple process,
Gefühl as the complex process composed out of several
Affecten" (1887, p. 350).
In the fifth edition of Grundzüge der Physiologischen
Psychologie (1902), Wundt and Wirth grouped the various con-
ceptions of Gefühl/emotion that were discussed at his time into
four main hypotheses: (a) the intellectualist hypothesis, accord-
ing to which Gefühl was a particular activity of cognizance, eine
besondere Bethätigung der Erkenntnis; (b) the interactionist
hypothesis, which causally attributed Gefühl to an interaction of
ideas, Wechselwirkung der Vorstellungen; (c) the cognitive
hypothesis, which suggested that Gefühl was subjective
Ergänzung, the subjective supplement (or complement) to
objective sensations and ideas; and (d) the sensualist hypothe-
sis, according to which Gefühle, emotions, were the physical
side effect of sensation or sensory excitation, physische
Nebenwirkung der Empfindungsreize. Wundt proposed a sys-
tematic distinction, which defined Gefühl clearly from a con-
ceptual point of view based on the neuroanatomical knowledge
of his time. In his classification the distinction between Gefühl,
Empfindung, and Affekt, which were conceptualized as pro-
cesses rather than states, concerned the intellectual content, the
time pattern of the process (Gefühlsverlauf), the motivational
component, the object of reference, and the tendency to act that
might or might not be implied.
The distinction between Emfindung and Gefühl was central
to the German argument. The translation of the German terms
into English abolishes the distinction.2 In 1900, the German­
English dictionary Encyklopädisches Wörterbuch translated the
term Empfindung to English as "sentiment" and "sensibility,"
both of which carry an intellectual and abstract connotation.
However, Wundt used Empfindung to mean sensation, not senti-
ment. Sentiment was signified by Gefühl. Wundt reserved
Empfindung for those changes in our momentary state (feeling,
perception) for which a causal agent could be clearly situated
outside the body, or changes in our state like hunger, when we
Wassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 167
talk about it in an abstract way, in contrast to feeling it. The
French literature used sensation as a translation for Empfindung,
sentiment for Gefühl, and émotion for Gemüthsbewegung; it
also used "vie affective" in the sense of Gemüth (Wundt, 1891,
p. 357). The English literature used the terms sensation, feeling,
and emotion, and also "affective process" and "affective state"
(in the meaning of Stimmung, mood) in partly synonymous
ways; it also used the term "idea." The French terms sentiment,
emotion, and idée and the English sentiment, emotion, and idea
are homonyms, which gave rise to many misunderstandings
because of their variable usage.
French Emotion Terms
The French terms are important for understanding the meaning
of the German scientific texts. The connotation of émotion and
emotion, as it was first used in French by Montaigne (1533­
1592) and Descartes (1596­1650), and later in English by Hume
(1711­1776), is close to the concerns of 19th-century German
psychophysiologists--which is not surprising, because Wundt
read Hume and Descartes. In Les Passions de l'âme, 1649,
Descartes used the term émotion to describe the connection
between mind (soul) and body that he thought was effected
through the movement of corporeal "animal spirits" in the
nerves, which he thought were hollow, informing the soul situ-
ated in the pineal gland about the state of the body. French psy-
chologists in the 19th century recommended Descartes' work to
psychologists studying emotion and attributed the term émotion
to Descartes. Dumas (1948) wrote that at first Descartes called
all emotional phenomena "passions," both "what is called today
passions, such as love, hate, ambition, desire, and also the emo-
tions like surprise, happiness, fear" (pp. 27­28). Later Descartes
held that it was better to call all of them not passions de l'âme
but émotions de l'âme, "emotions of the soul," because of all of
the thoughts the soul could have, these moved the soul most
strongly. The International English and French Dictionary
(Smith & Hamilton, 1880, p. 187) read, "Emotion: (Latin emo-
vere) émotion."
Hume spoke of "impressions or emotions" and he used the
term "affections." In An Enquiry Concerning Human
Understanding, Hume (1817) wrote that the "second property"
which he observed in the human mind
[I]s a like association of impressions or emotions. All resembling
impressions are connected together; and no sooner one arises, than the rest
naturally follow. Grief and disappointment give rise to anger, anger to
envy, envy to malice, and malice to grief again. In a like manner, our
temper, when elevated with joy, naturally throes itself into love, generosity,
courage, pride, and other resembling affections. (Vol. 2, p. 177)
In the French translation of Hume's (1748) work, émotion is
used, in English emotion (p. 16). At that time émotion and emo-
tion were used synonymously. Hume like Montaigne used the
term émotion to signify diffuse feelings that we do not have a
proper name for and that we cannot precisely localize.
A look at historical French dictionary entries for émotion and
sentiment provides an approximation of the problems that the
German psychophysiologists and the French, who followed
suit, tried to understand in the 19th century. I have assessed the
French dictionaries through theARTLF project of the University
of Chicago (http://portail.atilf.fr) which can be considered rep-
resentative for my purpose. The dictionaries that I consulted are
mostly those by the Académie Française, who claims normative
status in terms of defining the French language. I have consulted
all existing editions from 1762 to 1932. I use these entries for
illustrative purposes in a qualitative manner. The description of
émotion and sentiment in French did not change significantly in
these dictionaries, even when some of the concurrent political
events of the times left an imprint. The entries on émotion were
short, those on sentiment considerably longer. Judging from the
length of the entries, the term sentiment was more frequently
used than émotion. This shows also in a qualitative way in the
Google Books Ngram Viewer (available online). In what fol-
lows, I give a representative example taken from the fourth edi-
tion of the Dictionnaire de L'Académie française (1762). The
entry showed that émotion was thought to act on three levels,
the humors, the spirits, and the soul.
ÉMOTION. s.f. Altération, mouvement excité dans les humeurs, dans
les esprits, dans l'âme. J'ai peur d'avoir la fièvre, j'ai senti quelque
émotion. Il n'a plus la fièvre, mais je lui trouve encore quelque émotion,
de l'émotion. Il a trop marché, cela lui a donné, lui a causé de l'émotion.
Ce discours le fâcha, on vit de l'émotion sur son visage. Il n'en eut pas
la moindre émotion. Il attendit le coup sans émotion. Il a de l'émotion
dans le pouls.
On dit, Il y a de l'émotion dans le peuple, pour dire, qu'Il y a de la disposition
dans le peuple à se soulever. (Académie française, 1762, p. 608)
The entry described émotion as both corporeal and mental reac-
tion to a physical or psychological event, which could be felt
and shown, or felt but not shown. In particular, it mentioned
"The speech angered him, one saw the emotion on his face."
And, "He didn't show the least emotion. He waited for the shot
without emotion." Emotion could show on the face and in the
pulse. It was associated with a state of fever and with having
walked too much.3 The addendum stated that the term was also
used to designate a tendency in the people to rise up. Among the
various meanings given for émotion in French dictionaries, his-
torians have been most interested in the notion of émeute, mob
action (Frevert, 2011, p. 18). However, the other meanings of
émotion and sentiment were much more pertinent to the scien-
tific agenda of 19th-century psychologists, who attempted to
understand the fundamental principles of brain function and
physiology.
The entry shifted slightly over time. It retained that émotion
could show on the face in reaction to alarming or annoying news
until 1932, when the face was no longer specifically mentioned.
The French Revolution left a temporary trace with "the feelings
of the heart," specifically mentioning hatred and anger, and the
note that an orator raised high emotions in the spirits of his audi-
ence (Académie française, 1798, p. 479). In 1832, qualitative
differentiations were introduced instead; émotion could be
lively, strong, and light. Sweet and tender émotions were men-
tioned. Hundred years later, in 1932, the entry was considerably
168 Emotion Review Vol. 9 No. 2
shorter. It retained the qualitative distinctions of émotion, the
idea that émotion was expressed in speech, in the tone of voice,
and mentioned the unflinching reaction to bad news, "He didn't
feel [ressentit] the least emotion at hearing this news" (Author
translation from Académie française, 1932, p. 1:451).
French Dictionary Entries for "Sentiment"
The term émotion appealed to French psychophysiologists as a
scientific term, because émotion was easier to disambiguate
than sentiment (Dumas, 1895). A parallel reading of the entries
for émotion and sentiment elucidates the epistemological stakes
in the psychophysiological debate. The International English
and French Dictionary (Smith & Hamilton, 1880) translated the
English sentiment to opinion, thought, and also sensibility,
"sentiment; opinion, avis." The entry sentiment in Dictionnaire
de l'Académie française (1762) was comprehensive but I can-
not paraphrase it here for lack of space. The description of senti-
ment in the Dictionaire critique de la langue française (Feraud,
1787­1788), clearly stated the distinction between perceiving,
feeling, and understanding that was still at stake in 19th-century
debates on the nature of Gefühl, emotion. Sentiment:
1°. Sensation, Perception (Synon.) Ces mots désignent l'impression, que
les objets font sur l'âme; mais le sentiment va au coeur, la sensation
s'arrête aux sens, et la perception s'adresse à l'esprit. (Féraud, 1994, p.
C551a)
Sentiment, like sensation and perception, designated "impres-
sions that objects make on the soul," but sentiment "goes to the
heart, sensation stops at the senses, and perception addresses the
mind." The entry gave sensation and perception as synonyms
for "sentiment." The Dictionaire critique de la langue française
specified that (fr) sentiment was "more certain" than (fr) opin-
ion, whereas thought (pensée) belonged to (fr) conjecture,
assumption, and was less fixed and less ascertained. Riskin
(2002) argued that in the 18th century, French scientists fused
sensation and sentiment. In the 19th century, medical physio-
logical and psychological research worked to establish the neu-
roanatomical and conceptual distinctions between emotion,
sensation, and perception, Gefühl, Empfindung, and
Wahrnehmung. The German psychophysiological literature dis-
cussed judgment as an essential feature of Gefühl.
Translations of German Gefühl to emotion in James's work,
as well as the English to French and French to English transla-
tions of the terms émotion and emotion, and of sentiment
affected how emotion was conceived in the psychological litera-
ture at the turn of the 20th century. This can be seen particularly
well in the works of the French psychophysiologists Dumas
(1895, 1900, 1923; James & Dumas, 1903); Binet (1894), and
Ribot (1883, 1885, 1896a, 1896b, 1897, 1903), who all studied
Wundt's work. When Dumas (1895) translated Lange's work
and James's article "What Is an Emotion" to French he used the
term émotion, "Introduction à Lange, Les émotions. Étude psy-
chophysiologique," and La théorie de l'émotion (James &
Dumas, 1903). When Ribot (1896b) published La Psychologie
des sentiments, it was translated as The Psychology of the
Emotions (1897). However, Ribot deliberately used sentiment
instead of émotion, which had been widely used during the
1890s in the debate about the nature of emotion that revolved
around the James­Lange theory of emotion, in order to make a
distinction between the more basic notion of émotion, and the
more complex and intellectual sense of sentiment. In Germany,
Ribot's (1903) work was published as Psychologie der Gefühle.
Conclusion
The contemporary discussion on the concept of emotion lets
psychologists engage in a debate de lana caprina rixari when
proposing to replace "emotion" by "affect" or rather use "feel-
ing." The problem cannot be solved by "simply using terms like
emotion, sentiment, or feeling, in their general senses" as Dixon
suggested (T. Dixon, personal communication, June 6, 2013);
nor by substituting "feeling" for emotion, as Damasio (2001)
recommended, or "affect" for emotion as Feldman Barrett and
Bliss-Moreau (2009) proposed. I am not arguing that the English
use of emotion terms is poor. Rather, I try to point out that the
word emotion has a very definite connotation in English, which
is used in a self-evident manner by Anglophone scholars in psy-
chology and other fields, and which does not correspond to the
signification or meanings of the German term Gefühl, but which
was nonetheless used to translate the term Gefühl and to discuss
about the German scientific texts in English at the turn of the
20th century, most notably by William James and his American
disciples.
Evidence for the convergence of languages in the scientific
concept of emotion is also given by the fact that Wundt's works
were not translated to English but were nonetheless read by the
French psychophysiologists and by the British scientists, who
worked out fundamental principles of brain function such as
Sherrington (1899­1900), and that informed scientific research
agendas on emotion until the mid-20th century (Dumas, 1948).
The authors who worked on the scientific conception of emo-
tion, for instance, Mosso (1896, English translation [La Paura,
1884]), Wundt, Lange, Guiseppe Sergi, A. Wright, Lehmann,
Binet, Dumas, Ribot, Charles Féré, François-Franck to name a
few, were influenced by Kant's philosophy and the neuroana-
tomical and physiological research that revised Bichat's con-
ception of the nervous system over the course of the 19th
century. They referred to many authors, but not to the Scottish
moral philosopher Thomas Brown, whom Dixon (2012) desig-
nated as the "inventor of the emotions" (p. 340).
Dixon held that the intellectual historian's diagnosis pro-
vides the key to the definitional problem of emotion in contem-
porary psychology. Brown defined emotions as being
indefinable. "Two hundred years later, we are still living with
this legacy of Thomas Brown's concept of `emotion'" (Dixon,
2012, p. 340). According to Dixon (2003), the "all-important
distinction between troubling desires and passions" and "milder
affections and sentiments" is at the heart of the matter (p. 109).
While Dixon showed that Brown was important for the spread
of the term emotion in English, it is less sure that the historical
Wassmann Forgotten Origins, Occluded Meanings 169
diagnosis can solve the "definitional malaise" for psychology.
The distinction between troubling passions and mild sentiments
does not go to the heart of scientific psychology's agenda at the
time when the "concept of emotion" was forged.
As I attempted to show, the interdisciplinary field of emotion
studies leaves out an entire body of texts that were not written in
English but nonetheless formative in the creation of the scien-
tific concept of emotion. The complexity of the epistemological
discussion of Gefühl in 19th-century psychology is occluded by
the focus on the English language. As we could see, the English
term emotion has a more narrowly defined meaning than the
German Gefühl, even though the terms were taken as equivalent
in translation. The topic of emotion, Gefühl, émotion was
debated internationally, and was fundamentally informed by
German scientific psychology. The International English and
French Dictionary (Smith & Hamilton, 1880) gave the German
fühlen in brackets for the French translation (sentir) of the
English term feel. The items listed in the entry, such as feelings
of warm and cold, hunger and thirst, pleasure and pain, were the
entities that physiological psychologists discussed when they
debated Gefühl in the scientific literature. The questions raised
ranged from sensation, touch, and perception, to feeling well,
and to questions concerning apperception and conscious aware-
ness (Wahrnehmung, Apperzeption and Bewusstsein in the
German psychophysiological literature). Wundt addressed these
questions beginning in Vorlesungen (1863), when he asked
"Was ist das Gefühl?" James took this up in 1884, when asking
"What is an emotion?" The German texts also discussed the
feeling of self, the sense of self, and the distinction made by the
brain between "I" and the environment during infant develop-
ment. Furthermore, motivation, desire, and volition were
included in the reflections about Gefühl; as was the relation
between simple sense feelings (sinnliche Gefühle), more com-
plex emotional composites (Gefühle or Affekte), and highly
abstract intellectual emotions or sentiments (Wundt, 1874,
1902­1903). This set of meanings is not equivalent with the six
"basic emotions" that are commonly associated with the term
emotion in English today, referring to the classifications based
on facial expressions provided by Darwin (1872) and Ekman
(Ekman & Friesen, 1975). While the English term emotion and
the French term émotion were used synonymously until the turn
of the 20th century, these terms have become homonyms in the
contemporary literature.
Concepts come into existence in through and across lan-
guages, the editors of the Dictionary of Untranslatables (Cassin,
Rendall, & Apter, 2014) hold. The English translation of the
entry for German Gefühl, does not mention "emotion" as a
translation for Gefühl (but only English: feeling, sensation, sen-
timent, opinion; and French: sentiment and sensation) and it
glosses over the distinction made between Gefühl and
Empfindung in German, because the editors felt that this was no
longer a problem for philosophy. It was a central conceptual
problem for psychologists though. The Dictionary of
Untranslatables (Cassin et al., 2014) ends for the German emo-
tion terms in the 18th century. The entry Gefühl draws on dic-
tionaries by Adelung (1774­1786) and Eberhard (1795) and
covers thinkers such as Kant, Christian Wolff, and Johann
Nicolaus Tetens, but leaves invisible the continuation and trans-
formation of their thought in the physiological psychology of
the 19th century. The scientific concept of emotion was created
in the confluence of Latin, French, English, and German. It is
not properly understood, if taken solely as an English term.
Translation is not just a matter of the past. It remains monnaie
courant for the time being, even when it does not involve a
translator (but maybe Google translate), it takes place in the
mind and brain of the writer. Europeans are still raised in their
native languages and cultures, and linguists rightly point to the
limitations of English as a universal frame. The limitations
show in the renewed debate on terminology, whether to use feel-
ings, or emotion, or affect, and in the renewed attempt at con-
ceptualizing "emotion" in more integrated and complex ways in
psychological research. Therefore, it is timely to raise aware-
ness for the German language texts and multilingual transfor-
mations that have informed the contemporary scientific
vocabulary of emotion(s) in psychology.

Notes
1 The German neurobiologist Hüther (2010) used this order in his
numerous public lectures.
2 The Dictionary of Untranslatables (Cassin et al., 2014) explicitly
erased the distinction Gefühl/Empfindung, which was still present in
the French original (Cassin, 2004) and points right to the core of the
problem (p. 355).
3 Lehmann (1892) still used "febril," feverish, to describe an anxious
state of mind.
