Abstract
Objective The negative association between religiosity
(religious beliefs and church attendance) and the likelihood
of substance use disorders is well established, but the
mechanism(s) remain poorly understood. We investigated
whether this association was mediated by social support or
mental health status.
Method We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2002
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (n = 36,370).
We first used logistic regression to regress any alcohol use
in the past year on sociodemographic and religiosity
variables. Then, among individuals who drank in the past
year, we regressed past year alcohol abuse/dependence on
sociodemographic and religiosity variables. To investigate
whether social support mediated the association between
religiosity and alcohol use and alcohol abuse/dependence
we repeated the above models, adding the social support
variables. To the extent that these added predictors
modified the magnitude of the effect of the religiosity
variables, we interpreted social support as a possible
mediator. We also formally tested for mediation using
path analysis. We investigated the possible mediating role
of mental health status analogously. Parallel sets of
analyses were conducted for any drug use, and drug abuse/
dependence among those using any drugs as the dependent
variables.
Results The addition of social support and mental health
status variables to logistic regression models had little
effect on the magnitude of the religiosity coefficients in any
of the models. While some of the tests of mediation were
significant in the path analyses, the results were not always
in the expected direction, and the magnitude of the effects
was small.
Conclusions The association between religiosity and
decreased likelihood of a substance use disorder does not
appear to be substantively mediated by either social sup-
port or mental health status.

Introduction
Alcohol and drug disorders are common, occurring in
4­9% of the U.S. population in a given year [16, 26, 27,
57], and causing substantial morbidity [39], accounting for
12% of all disability in Western industrialized countries
[40]. The negative social and health consequences associ-
ated with alcohol and drug disorders are well understood
[49] and include lower employment outcomes [5, 37, 38],
high rates of criminal justice involvement and violence
[4, 10, 12, 15, 36, 51], and substantial medical/physical
consequences [20, 48, 49].
The negative correlation between religiosity (religious
beliefs and church attendance) and the likelihood of sub-
stance use disorders (of both alcohol and drugs) has been
extensively documented in the U.S., [7, 29, 33, 36, 42, 44,
45, 53, 58] and Europe [19, 59, 61], but the mechanism(s)
underlying this correlation remain poorly understood.
Evidence does suggest that religiosity is most strongly
associated with the decision to use or completely abstain
from alcohol or drugs, and less strongly associated with
abuse or dependence, among those who do drink or use
drugs [36]. It is likely that prohibitions against the use of
alcohol and drugs contained in some religious doctrines
result in lower rates of substance abuse and dependence
among individuals that subscribe to such beliefs.
However, there exists little research investigating other
mechanisms that may also be involved. There are at least
two potential mechanisms. First, it has been posited that the
general salutary effects of religion might be due to
increased social support [14, 47]. The increased social
support afforded by religion might also influence the rela-
tionship between religious involvement and the likelihood
of substance use disorders [43]. In particular social support
might have two effects: (1) supporting social norms against
alcohol use through stigma; and (2) providing a source of
social interaction that does not involve alcohol or drugs. We
call this the ``social support mediation'' hypothesis. This
hypothesis has been tested in at least three samples; two
samples of college students [11, 35], and the other in a
sample of young African-American adults [6]. These stud-
ies did not find evidence for the social support hypothesis.
A second potential mechanism is that better mental health
among religious individuals may be a factor in their lower
rates of substance use disorders. Individuals with mental
health disorders have an increased likelihood of substance
use disorders [16, 23, 27] and in those cases where mental
health disorders are comorbid with substance use disorders,
the mental health disorder typically precedes the substance
use disorder [28], or is often independent of the substance use
disorder [16]. Further, individuals who are more religious, or
who attend church more frequently, have generally been
found to have better mental health [29, 33].
Frequency of religious attendance is often a proxy for
degree of religiousness; getting up on Sunday morning and
spending that time at church instead of at the beach or
fishing or having breakfast with friends, indicates that
religion is important to the person. If important, then it is
likely to be used when confronting psychological, social,
and medical stressors. There is a wealth of research
showing better coping and less depression among those
who use religion to cope, both cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal [31]. Furthermore, religious attendance has been
shown to directly predict speed of remission from depres-
sion among stressed adults [30]. Religious attendance is
also highly related with altruism, which is frequently
related to lower rates of depression and other psychiatric
disorders [50]. Thus, mental health may mediate the rela-
tionship between religiosity and the likelihood of having a
substance use disorder. We call this the ``mental health
mediation'' hypothesis.
In this paper we investigate these two potential under-
lying mechanisms using data from the National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (n = 36,370). The
NSDUH survey is ideal for this purpose. It is nationally
representative, includes DSM-IV measures of both alcohol
abuse/dependence disorders and drug abuse/dependence
disorders, and contains extensive information on possible
confounders and mediators of the substance abuse and
religion relationship, such as sociodemographic factors,
mental health status, and social support. This is important,
as one of the criticisms of prior work on religion and health
in general is ``the inability of studies to date to tease apart
attendance from more general efforts to remain active in
the community'' [52].
Our first goal was to estimate, with the precision that our
extremely large sample allows, the extent to which the
lower likelihood of substance abuse or dependence disorder
among the religious is due to abstinence from any substance
use, and to what extent the lower likelihood is due to a lower
likelihood of a substance use disorder, given some sub-
stance use. For example, religious people might have a
lower likelihood of an alcohol use disorder because they are
completely abstinent, or because among religious individ-
uals who do drink, there are lower rates of alcohol use
disorders. Second, we investigated whether the effects of
church attendance and religious beliefs on the likelihood of
substance use disorder were mediated by social support
(social support mediation hypothesis). Third, we investi-
gated whether the lower likelihood of substance use disor-
ders among the religious is mediated by the fact that the
religious generally have better mental health (mental health
mediation hypothesis). To our knowledge, these questions
regarding possible mediators have never been empirically
investigated using nationally representative data. We con-
ducted separate analyses for alcohol and drug use disorders.

Methods
Sample
We utilized cross-sectional data from the 2002 NSDUH
(n = 36,370). The Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration conducts the NSDUH annually for
the primary purpose of estimating the prevalence of illicit
drug, alcohol, and tobacco use in the United States [54].
Our sample included respondents age 18 and older and
has an average response rate of 75% [54]. The sample is
described in Table 1.
After complete description of the study to the subjects,
informed consent to continue the interview was obtained
verbally. (Written consent was not obtained because the
names of subjects are not used in the screening and inter-
view process.) To assure confidentiality, questions about
substance use, mental health problems, and treatment are
completed though audio-assisted interview technology
where respondents key their responses directly into a lap-
top computer. Remaining questions are completed through
a computer assisted in-person interview. The survey is
available at www.icpsr.umich.edu. Our analyses included
all adult respondents.
Dependent variables
Past year use of alcohol and illicit drugs
National Survey on Drug Use and Health contains data that
allowed us to construct binary indicators of any alcohol use
in the past year, and any illicit drug use in the past year.
Alcohol abuse/dependence and drug abuse/dependence
National Survey on Drug Use and Health is a structured
interview which contains items to construct DSM-IV
diagnoses of past year alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence,
drug abuse (for marijuana, hallucinogens, inhalants, tran-
quilizers, cocaine, heroin, pain relievers, stimulants, or
sedatives), and drug dependence for the same drugs. We
constructed binary indicators of whether the individual had
an alcohol abuse/dependence disorder in the past year, or
drug abuse/dependence disorder in the past year.
Independent variables
Church attendance and religious beliefs
The independent variables in the logistic regression models
included three religiosity variables. The first variable
was the number of times the subjects attended religious
services (excluding weddings and funerals) in the past year.

In NSDUH, participants were asked how often they had
attended religious services in the past year (0 times, 1 to 2
times, 3 to 5 times, 6 to 24 times, 25? times). In SAMHSA
publications this has often been collapsed into 0 to 24 times
vs 25? times, [17, 55, 56] while a report from the National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia
University using NSDUH data compared individuals who
never attended religious services with those who attended
at least weekly [44]. In this paper, we utilized categories of
0 to 2 times, 3 to 24 times, and 25 times or more, which we
have used in prior work with NSDUH [17, 18].
The other two items were Likert scale questions ``For
each statement, please indicate whether you strongly dis-
agree, disagree, agree, or strongly agree...Your religious
beliefs are an important part of your life...Your religious
beliefs influence how you make decisions in life.'' The
importance of the subject's religious beliefs in his or her
life was dichotomized with agree and strongly agree
combined as one category and disagree and strongly
disagree as the other; subjects' responses on whether reli-
gious beliefs influenced their decisions were similarly
dichotomized.
Social support
The social support variables included number of friends
(not including family members) the respondent shares
personal issues and concerns with (none, one, two or three,
four or five, and more than five), number of friends subjects
spent time with (none, one, two or three, four or five, and
more than five) and number of friends who really like or
care about the subjects (none, one, two or three, four or
five, and more than five). These were coded with a series of
indicator variables.
Mental health status
Our measure of mental health status was based on a
measure of non-specific psychological distress known as
the ``K6.'' The K6 was developed and validated for use in
the National Health Interview Survey and subsequently
included in the NSDUH [24, 25]. The K6 includes six
questions that measure on a 0 to 4 scale how frequently
respondents experienced symptoms of psychological
distress (nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness, depres-
sed, feeling worthless, feeling that everything is an effort)
during the month in the past year when they were feeling
their worst emotionally. These values were summed to
yield a score between 0 and 24 indicating the level of
psychological distress. We categorized these values into
three groups with roughly equal numbers of subjects in
each group based on its rank (0 to 1, 2 to 5, and 6 or
more).
Sociodemographic factors
Covariates included age (18­25, 26­34, 35­49, and 50 or
older), gender, race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic
Black,Hispanic,and other), marital status(married, widowed,
divorced, or separated and never been married), education
(less than high school, high school, some college, and college
graduates or higher), and income (\$20,000, $20,000­
$49,999, $50,000­$74,999, and $75,000 or more).
Analyses
We first used logistic regression to regress any alcohol use
in the past year on sociodemographic factors and the reli-
gion variables (Table 2). We conducted a separate logistic
regression to assess the effect of each religion variable, due
to the multicollinearity among the three. Then, among
individuals who drank in the past year, we regressed the

binary indicator of past year alcohol abuse/dependence on
the sociodemographic factors and the religion variables.
Again we used a separate regression for each religion
variable.
To investigate whether the relationship between any
alcohol use and the religion variables, or between alcohol
abuse/dependence and the religion variables among those
who drank, might be mediated by social support, we then
repeated the above models, adding the social support
variables (Table 3). To the extent that these added pre-
dictors modified the magnitude of the effect of the religious
variables, we interpreted social support as a possible
mediator [3].
In an analogous fashion we investigated mental health
status as a mediator between any alcohol use and the
religious variables, or between alcohol abuse/dependence
and the religious variables, among those who drank
(Table 4).
A parallel set of analyses was conducted for use of any
illicit drugs, and drug abuse/dependence among those with
any drug use (Tables 5, 6, 7). All these regression models
were run with survey design variables incorporated for
stratification, clustering and weighting using Survey
Logistic procedure in SAS version 9.2.
Test of mediation
As a sensitivity analysis, and to test formally for mediation,
we also conducted our analyses using path analysis tech-
niques, utilizing Mplus version 5.1. These models formally
incorporate a direct pathway (e.g., the pathway directly
from religious attendance to the alcohol or drug outcomes)

and an indirect pathway (e.g., the pathway from religious
attendance to social support to the alcohol or drug out-
comes). Testing the significance of the indirect pathway
represents a formal significance test of mediation effects.
These path models were estimated using mean and vari-
ance adjusted weighted least-squares estimator and the
probit link function [41].
To show effect sizes of religiosity on study dependent
variables, we present odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi-
dence intervals from the logistic regressions in the tables,
while reporting significant P-values for the indirect path-
ways from the path analyses in the text. We believe ORs,
which can be calculated from exponentiating logistic
regression coefficients, are easier to interpret and give the
reader the best sense of the magnitude of the effects of the
independent variables. However, we believe path tech-
niques are the best way to formally test for mediation.
Results
In NSDUH, 46% of respondents reported attending church
0 to 2 times in the past year, 24% reported attending 3 to 24
times per year, and 30% reported attending 25 or more
times per year (Table 1). Seventy-eight percent reported
that religious beliefs were an important part of their lives,
and 75% reported that their religious beliefs influenced the
decisions they made.
In models that controlled for sociodemographic factors,
but not other covariates, the three measures of religiosity
were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of any
past-year use of alcohol, and any past-year use of illicit
drugs (Tables 2, 5). For example, compared to those who
attended 25 to 52 times per year, the ORs for any alcohol
use for those with occasional church attendance (3 to 24
times per year) and infrequent church attendance (0 to 2
times per year) were 2.09 and 2.29, respectively. Similarly,
for those who said religion was not important in their lives,
the odds of any alcohol use was 1.55 the odds for those
who reported religion was important in their lives. Mea-
sures of religious attendance and religious beliefs were also
significantly associated with a lower likelihood of abuse/
dependence among those with any alcohol use (although
the magnitude of the effect was smaller than for the
abstinence step), but religious attendance and religiosity
were not significantly associated with drug abuse/depen-
dence among those who used any illicit drugs.
The addition of social support variables had only small
effects on the magnitude of the church attendance and
religious beliefs coefficients in any of the alcohol use, drug
use, alcohol abuse/dependence, or drug abuse/dependence
regressions (Tables 3, 6). However, in our path analyses
the indirect pathways (religiosity affecting social support,
social support affecting alcohol, or drug outcome) were
statistically significant in the relationship between the three
measures of religious attendance/religiosity and any alco-
hol use (P \ 0.001). In these regressions, religiosity was
associated with greater social support and social support
was positively associated with any drinking. For this rea-
son, in the corresponding logistic regressions the magni-
tude of the ORs actually increased (e.g., from 1.55 for
religion not being very important vs 1.00 for religion being
important (Table 2) to 1.59 for religion not being very
important vs 1.00 for religion being very important
(Table 3) with the addition of the social support variables,
rather than decreased as expected. Consistent with the
relatively small changes in the ORs we observed with the
addition of social support variables to our logistic regres-
sion models, the magnitudes of the indirect pathway
regression coefficients were generally only about 10% the
magnitude of the direct pathway regression coefficients.

The addition of mental health status had only small
effects on the church attendance and religiosity coefficients
in the alcohol use, drug use, alcohol abuse/dependence, or
drug/abuse dependence regressions (Tables 4, 7). However,
when we tested the significance of the indirect pathway
(e.g., religiosity influencing mental health, mental health
influencing alcohol, or drug outcome), we found evidence
for mental health mediation in the regression of alcohol
abuse/dependence on church attendance (P \ 0.001), and
the regressions of any drug use on church attendance
(P \ 0.001) and any drug use on religious beliefs). These
effects were in the direction we hypothesized, with the ORs
for the religion variables decreasing with the addition of the
mental health variables. Again, the magnitude of the coef-
ficients for the indirect pathway was small compared to the
magnitude of the coefficients for the direct pathway.
Discussion
Using a large, nationally representative community sample,
we found a highly significant, negative relationship between
religiosity and the presence of a substance use disorder in
the past year. Consistent with prior research [36], our results
strongly suggest that the lower likelihood of substance use
disorder is due mainly to effects on abstinence, although the
decreased likelihood of a substance use disorder among
those who drink or use illicit drugs is not an unimportant
factor.
Importantly, our multivariate models allow us to esti-
mate the independent effects of religion, and compare the
magnitude of these religious effects to the effects of soci-
odemographic factors. For example, in our analyses a
strong predictor of alcohol use was gender (for males,
OR = 2.50, reference group females). For sake of space,
sociodemographic variables were not included in our
tables. The gender effect was similar to the magnitude of
the OR for any alcohol use among those who attended
church 0 to 2 times per year, compared to the reference
group of 25 times or more. Thus, not only is the negative
association between religiosity and the likelihood of a
substance use disorder significant, the magnitude of the
effect is large.
Further, we found that religiosity is quite common. This
is consistent with other national surveys that show the
prominent role of religion in American life [13, 46]. Thus,
the fact that religiosity is quite common, combined with the
fact that there is a strong negative relationship between
religiosity and substance abuse suggests that religion may
play an important role in decreasing substance abuse in the
United States.
To our knowledge, our hypotheses had not been directly
investigated previously using national data. We found little
evidence for either our ``social support mediation''
hypothesis or the ``mental health mediation'' hypothesis.
That is, in some cases the indirect pathways were statisti-
cally significant; however, the inclusion of the mediating
variables to our models had only small effects on the
magnitude of the religion coefficients. We would note that
this situation, in which relatively modest effects are highly
significant, is not uncommon when analyzing extremely
large data sets. Further, while we expected the magnitude
of the OR to decrease with the addition of the putative
mediators, in some cases it increased. That is, in some
cases, in fully specified models, the effects of religion were
even larger than in the unadjusted models, although, again,
the magnitude of the change was modest.
This study has several important limitations. The
NSDUH has no information on religious affiliation (e.g.,
whether an individual is Catholic, or Baptist, or Jewish),
and so we were not able to investigate how this factor
influenced the likelihood of a substance use disorder. We
would refer interested readers to an excellent study by
Michalak on this topic [36], and note that the strength of
the association between religiosity and substance use dis-
orders likely differs for different religious groups. This is
not surprising, given the different views different reli-
gions take on alcohol, from utilizing it in their sacraments
(e.g., Catholics) to completely forbidding its use (e.g.,
Mormons).
The literature describes several dimensions of religios-
ity, such as intrinsic religiosity (intrinsic motivators for
religiosity, such as importance of religious beliefs) and
extrinsic religiosity (extrinsic motivators for religiosity,
such as becoming established in a community), or orga-
nized religiosity (religious attendance and participation in
organized social religious activities) and non-organized
religiosity (prayer, meditation) [1, 22, 33]. Although our
study measured beliefs and attendance, NSDUH does not
assess non-organized religiosity behaviors/indicators as
prayer, meditation, or reading religious texts that have been
posited elsewhere to be influential [32].
Because our data are cross-sectional, we can say nothing
directly regarding causality, although there are three pos-
sible causal relationships. First, religion may be a causal
factor in decreasing the likelihood of having a substance
use disorder in the past year. Second, the use of alcohol
may be a causal factor in decreasing religiosity and church
attendance. In particular, if an individual is abusing sub-
stances or is substance dependent, he or she may be less
likely to attend church because of feeling guilty or simply
not having the time to attend church because he or she is
spending that time seeking substances or using them. This
alternative explanation does not, however, fit as well for
our measures of religiosity other than church attendance
(i.e., importance of religious beliefs, influence of religious
Soc Psychiat Epidemiol (2010) 45:827­836 833
123
beliefs on decisions, etc.). Third, there might be a common
causal factor, for example a personality trait or genetic
factor, that both increases the likelihood of substance use
and abuse and decreases the probability of church atten-
dance [21], such as novelty seeking [9].
Social support and mental health are linked, in that good
social support may be associated with better mental health.
Nevertheless, we feel it makes sense to investigate these
variables separately. We would note that it is not unusual
for variables in social science investigation to be associated
with each other: race is linked with income and education,
education is linked with income, health is linked with age,
and so on. In our opinion, there are significant differences
between church attendance and social support, and even
more differences between social support and importance of
religious beliefs. Clearly, many individuals who state that
their religious beliefs are important do not have good social
support, and not all individuals with good social support
are religious.
Our cross-sectional data do not allow us to capture the
variability that may occur over time in both an individual's
drinking and drug use, and also in his or her religiosity.
Our work suggests many areas for future research, using
both qualitative and quantitative techniques. In particular,
given that religiosity is associated with lower rates of
substance use disorders, and the magnitude of the rela-
tionship is large, future studies are needed to investigate
what the ``active ingredient'' in religion is. The use of large
national data sets such as in the present analysis allows us
to investigate associations and some possible mediators,
using relatively crude measures. However, qualitative
studies might be important in disentangling these complex
relationships and phenomena, and provide new hypotheses
for future quantitative studies.
We also need to better understand possible moderators
of the relationship between religiosity and alcohol and drug
outcomes. That is, are the effects equally strong for men
and women, or single and married individuals?
A traditional reason for identification of risk or protec-
tive risk factors for disease is to decrease risk factors and
promote protective factors. However, there is no consensus
on the clinical and public policy implications of the inverse
association between religiosity and substance use disor-
ders, or other diseases [2, 8, 29, 34, 43, 52, 60]. Obviously
one key concern regarding promotion of religion as a
possible means of decreasing substance abuse is separation
of church and state [2], especially since many substance
use services are government funded. Thus, we also need
greater discussion of the clinical and public policy impli-
cations, if any, of this type of work.
In conclusion, using data from a large, nationally rep-
resentative survey, we have shown that religious involve-
ment is significantly associated with a lower likelihood of
alcohol use, alcohol abuse/dependence, and drug use, and
the magnitude of the effects is large. These effects do not
appear to be mediated by either social support or mental
health status. Prospective studies are needed to help sort
out causal questions in the religion-substance abuse
relationship.
