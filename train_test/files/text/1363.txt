Prevalence of Coronary Heart Disease Among NHANES
III Participants Age 50 Years and Older

Although the individual components of the metabolic
syndrome are clearly associated with increased risk for
coronary heart disease (CHD), we wanted to quantify
the increased prevalence of CHD among people with
metabolic syndrome. The Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was used
to categorize adults over 50 years of age by presence of
metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Education
Program [NCEP] definition) with or without diabetes.
Demographic and risk factor information was deter-
mined for each group, as well as the proportion of each
group meeting specific criteria for metabolic syndrome.
The prevalence of CHD for each group was then deter-
mined. Metabolic syndrome is very common, with 44%
of the U.S. population over 50 years of age meeting the
NCEP criteria. In contrast, diabetes without metabolic
syndrome is uncommon (13% of those with diabetes).
Older Americans over 50 years of age without metabolic
syndrome regardless of diabetes status had the lowest
CHD prevalence (8.7% without diabetes, 7.5% with
diabetes). Compared with those with metabolic syn-
drome, people with diabetes without metabolic syn-
drome did not have an increase in CHD prevalence.
Those with metabolic syndrome without diabetes had
higher CHD prevalence (13.9%), and those with both
metabolic syndrome and diabetes had the highest prev-
alence of CHD (19.2%) compared with those with nei-
ther. Metabolic syndrome was a significant univariate
predictor of prevalent CHD (OR 2.07, 95% CI 1.66­
2.59). However, blood pressure, HDL cholesterol, and
diabetes, but not presence of metabolic syndrome, were
significant multivariate predictors of prevalent CHD.
The prevalence of CHD markedly increased with the
presence of metabolic syndrome. Among people with
diabetes, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome was
very high, and those with diabetes and metabolic syn-
drome had the highest prevalence of CHD. Among all
individuals with diabetes, prevalence of CHD was in-
creased compared with those with metabolic syndrome
without diabetes. However, individuals with diabetes
without metabolic syndrome had no greater prevalence
of CHD compared with those with neither. Diabetes

The frequent simultaneous presence of obesity,
hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and hypertension was
first described in the late 1960s (1). This associ-
ation (i.e., diabetes, hypertension, and obesity
with hyperlipidemia) was subsequently highlighted in the
late 1970s by a number of German researchers, including
Haller and colleagues (2,3). They coined the term "meta-
bolic syndrome" and described its association with athero-
sclerosis. In 1991, Ferrannini et al. (4) described the same
clustering of abnormalities in this cardiovascular and
metabolic syndrome as being caused by insulin resistance
and concluded that "insulin resistance syndrome" was the
appropriate name for this condition. At about the same
time, Reaven (5,6) agreed that insulin resistance was the
cause of these abnormalities. He initially did not include
abdominal obesity, however, and he used the term "syn-
drome X." It appears that metabolic syndrome, insulin
resistance syndrome, and syndrome X all refer to the same
clustering of risk factors associated with atherosclerosis
and coronary heart disease (CHD). In fact, Meigs et al. (7)
found that among nondiabetic subjects from the Framing-
ham Offspring Study, a clustering of risk factors, including
hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose
intolerance (rather than hyperinsulinemia alone), charac-
terized the underlying features of the insulin resistance
syndrome.
The pathophysiology of this syndrome remains a subject
of continuing controversy, although some have suggested
a causal relationship with insulin resistance and/or vis-
ceral adiposity. At the same time, it has become increas-
ingly apparent that even small increases in fasting or
postprandial glucose values (including impaired glucose
tolerance or impaired fasting glucose) impart an increased
risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (8­14). In
the Quebec Prospective Study, Lamarche et al. (15)
showed that even without hyperglycemia, elevated levels
of insulin (i.e., insulin resistance), small dense LDL cho-
lesterol, and apolipoprotein B were associated with risk
for ischemic heart disease.
In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III provided a defi-
nition for metabolic syndrome (16). The NCEP criteria are
practical for physicians to use, since the variables defining

metabolic syndrome are commonly available in clinical
practice. Ford et al. (17) have previously shown that
metabolic syndrome is common in people 50 years of
age. Since glucose intolerance is an important part of
metabolic syndrome and increases with age, this report
will focus on the interactions among metabolic syndrome,
hyperglycemia, and prevalence of CHD. We used Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) data to evaluate the prevalence of CHD in
individuals 50 years of age with metabolic syndrome,
with and without diabetes, using the NCEP definition.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
NHANES III was conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in two phases: phase 1
(1988­1991) and phase 2 (1991­1994) (17­19). For this analysis, subjects
surveyed during either phase are included. The survey was a stratified
probability sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Afri-
can Americans, Mexican Americans, and the elderly were oversampled to
provide more accurate estimates of their characteristics within their respec-
tive populations and the population as a whole. Each respondent was assigned
a weight based on geographic and demographic characteristics to allow the
calculation of population-based estimates. A subset of adults 50 years of age
representing 76.1 million Americans was used for this analysis.
An adult in-home questionnaire was administered to sampled subjects 17
years of age. Physical exams were conducted on those subjects who were
ambulatory and who consented to the examination given at a date subsequent
to the in-home interview. Adults 50 years of age who were scheduled for and
received morning physical exams after a fast of at least 9 h were retained for
analysis (n  3,510). During NHANES III, oral glucose tolerance testing was
conducted on approximately one-half of the examinees aged 40­74 years. This
subsample most closely conformed to the World Health Organization criteria
for oral glucose tolerance testing to identify diabetes and was the population
used to estimate the prevalence of diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance.
The NCEP ATP III panel defined metabolic syndrome as the presence of
three or more of the following risk determinants: 1) increased waist circum-
ference (102 cm [40 in] for men, 88 cm [35 in] for women); 2) elevated
triglycerides (150 mg/dl); 3) low HDL cholesterol (40 mg/dl in men, 50
mg/dl in women); 4) hypertension (130/85 mmHg); and 5) impaired fasting
glucose (110 mg/dl) (16).
We determined the prevalence of metabolic syndrome based on fasting
glucose levels and glucose tolerance and then stratified the population into
four groups (no metabolic syndrome or diabetes, metabolic syndrome without
diabetes, metabolic syndrome with diabetes, and no metabolic syndrome with
diabetes) using the NCEP definition of the metabolic syndrome and either
self-reported history of diabetes or a fasting plasma glucose value 7.0 mmol/l
(126 mg/dl) (16,20). Serum lipoproteins were evaluated as part of the blood
biochemistry panel of the laboratory exam. LDL cholesterol was calculated
using the Friedewald equation for those with serum triglyceride levels 400
mg/dl (21). Blood pressure is reported as the average of six readings, three
taken during the household interview and three taken during the physical
exam. The NCEP metabolic syndrome cutpoint for blood pressure is 130/85
mm/Hg. Individuals reporting a history of hypertension and current blood
pressure medication use were defined as having hypertension regardless of
measured blood pressure values. BMI was calculated as the weight of the
individual in kilograms divided by the square of the height in centimeters.
Individuals with a history of diabetes or glycemic medication use were defined
as having diabetes regardless of measured fasting glucose values. Insulin
measurements were performed using the Pharmacia Diagnostics radioimmu-
noassay kit. Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the formula of McAuley et
al. (22) as the exponent of [2.63  0.28 ln(insulin mU/l)  0.31 ln(triglyceride
mmol/l)] and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (23).
As a result of low prevalence of CHD in the population 50 years of age
(3.1% for 50 years vs. 12.3% for 50 years, unadjusted rates) and since
metabolic syndrome clusters with age, we chose to focus our analysis on
those 50 years of age. Presence of CHD is defined as self-reported myocar-
dial infarction or a positive response to the angina pectoris section of the Rose
Questionnaire (24). Our definition of CHD was based upon information
available in the NHANES III database, but probably represents an underesti-
mate of the true prevalence. Defining CHD only as self-reported without
including information from the Rose Questionnaire reduces the prevalence of
CHD by 2­3% but does not otherwise change our results.
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed using SAS version 8e and
SAS-callable SUDAAN version 8.0.1 (25,26). SUDAAN uses characteristics of
the sample design and sample weights to calculate appropriate estimates of
variance. The CROSSTAB and DESCRIPT procedures of SUDAAN were used
to produce frequencies of categorical variables and means  SE of continuous
variables. Overall tests of significance across the four study groups were
evaluated by ANOVA using the MULTILOG and REGRESS procedures.
Summary statistics are presented as means  SE for continuous measures and
frequency percentage for all discrete measures. Age-adjusted CHD prevalence
rates were computed by the direct method using the age distribution of the
U.S. population based on the 2000 U.S. Census.
For Fig. 2, tests of significance were calculated using pairwise comparisons
adjusted for multiple comparisons by the method of Bonferroni. A multivar-
iate logistic model predicting CHD was developed using the RLOGIST
procedure in SUDAAN. The independent variables of interest, the individual
risk factors of metabolic syndrome as defined by NCEP, diabetes, and an
indicator variable for metabolic syndrome (a proxy for the interactions of the
individual factors) were fit simultaneously. The odds ratios and 95% CIs for
having CHD given the presence of any one risk factor, controlling for all
others, are presented in Table 3.
The attributable risk of CHD was calculated as the difference in prevalence
between the population without either diabetes or metabolic syndrome and
the appropriate group (i.e., metabolic syndrome without diabetes, diabetes
without metabolic syndrome, diabetes and metabolic syndrome) divided by
the prevalence of CHD in the appropriate group.
RESULTS
Age-adjusted prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the
U.S. population 50 years of age categorized by glucose
intolerance is shown in Fig. 1. There is a stepwise increase
in prevalence of metabolic syndrome with worsening
glucose tolerance from 26% in those with normal fasting
glucose rising to 86% in those with diabetes. As can be
seen in Table 1, metabolic syndrome is very common in
the U.S. population over the age of 50 years, with 43.5%
meeting the NCEP criteria. In contrast, diabetes without
metabolic syndrome is uncommon in the over-50 popula-
tion (only 13% of diabetic patients do not meet criteria
for metabolic syndrome).
For most cardiovascular risk factors, the group with

metabolic syndrome and without diabetes was more com-
parable to the diabetes with metabolic syndrome group
than to both groups without metabolic syndrome. An
exception to this observation was HbA1c
levels, where the
two diabetes groups were comparable. The two groups
without metabolic syndrome were also very similar regard-
less of absence or presence of diabetes. Insulin resistance
was highest and insulin sensitivity was lowest in the
diabetes with metabolic syndrome group (4.9  0.1),
followed by the metabolic syndrome without diabetes
group (5.5  0.1). Insulin resistance was lowest and insulin
sensitivity was highest in the group without metabolic
syndrome or diabetes (7.4  0.1, P  0.0001).
The proportion of each group meeting each NCEP
criterion for metabolic syndrome is shown in Table 2.
Again, the characteristics of the two metabolic syndrome
groups are comparable with the exception of fasting
glucose (by definition) and are different from the two
groups without metabolic syndrome.
Figure 2 shows the age-adjusted prevalence of CHD in
the various groups. The overall prevalence in this age
group was 11.7%. Americans over 50 years of age without
metabolic syndrome and diabetes had the lowest CHD
prevalence (8.7%), and those with both metabolic syn-
drome and diabetes had the highest (19.2%). Individuals
with diabetes in the absence of metabolic syndrome did
not have an incremental increase in CHD prevalence
compared with individuals with neither (7.5 vs. 8.7%,
respectively). Differences between the groups, both overall
and using pairwise comparisons, were all statistically
significant (P  0.001).
Not surprisingly, metabolic syndrome was a significant
predictor of prevalent CHD in univariate analysis (OR 2.07,
95% CI 1.66­2.59). However, as shown in Table 3, blood
pressure, HDL cholesterol, and diabetes, but not presence
of metabolic syndrome, were significant predictors of
prevalent CHD in multivariate analyses.
As shown in Table 4, the excess prevalence of CHD
attributable to metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes was
37.4% (1.1 million cases of CHD) in the group with meta-
bolic syndrome without diabetes and 50.3% (1.1 million
cases of CHD) in the group with both metabolic syndrome
and diabetes. The entire excess prevalence of CHD among
those with diabetes was in the group with both diabetes
and metabolic syndrome.
DISCUSSION
This analysis examined CHD prevalence by metabolic
syndrome criteria from the NCEP and diabetes status
based on 1997 American Diabetes Association criteria
using NHANES III, the most recent large clinical survey of
a representative sample of the U.S. population, which
collected all necessary information to characterize individ-

uals by metabolic status. The prevalence of metabolic
syndrome increases with increasing glucose intolerance.
The prevalence of CHD markedly increases with the
presence of metabolic syndrome. The prevalence of CHD
among all participants with diabetes was increased com-
pared with the prevalence among those with metabolic
syndrome without diabetes. However, individuals with
diabetes without metabolic syndrome had about the same
prevalence of CHD as those with neither.
One possible reason for the excess prevalence of CHD
associated with metabolic syndrome is the direct effect of
insulin resistance on the heart and arteries (27). It is more
likely that the bulk of the increased prevalence is mediated
by known cardiovascular risk factors. Indeed, all five
metabolic syndrome criteria are established cardiovascu-
lar risk factors. We know that the presence of multiple risk
factors confers increased risk (28). However, it is unclear
whether the metabolic syndrome confers elevated risk
beyond the sum of its parts (29). Our multivariate analysis
would suggest that the risk from metabolic syndrome is
derived from its individual components, especially HDL
cholesterol and blood pressure. However, modeling meta-
bolic syndrome as the sole predictor of CHD yields more
than a twofold increased risk compared with not having
metabolic syndrome and is a convenient way to encapsu-
late a number of proven risk factors.
It has been argued that the excess prevalence of CHD
seen in those with diabetes is directly associated with
hyperglycemia. In our study, metabolic syndrome has been
demonstrated to be much more important, with no in-
crease in prevalence of CHD seen in people with diabetes
in the absence of metabolic syndrome. Although one of the
components of metabolic syndrome is fasting hyperglyce-
mia and many of the subjects in this study with metabolic
syndrome without diabetes still may have had hyperglyce-
mia in the nondiabetic range, modestly increased glucose
alone is unlikely to account for the increased CHD risk.
Because 1) most people with diabetes have type 2 diabetes
and metabolic syndrome and 2) most individuals with
impaired fasting glucose also have metabolic syndrome,
our work is consistent with our previous study using
NHANES III data that showed an increased CHD preva-
lence in those with diabetes and impaired fasting glucose
(30).
There are limitations to this analysis. Since the case
fatality rate among people with diabetes is higher than in
those without diabetes, this cross-sectional study is sub-
ject to survival bias, which would underestimate the
impact of diabetes on CHD. The same may also be true for
metabolic syndrome in the absence of diabetes. The NCEP
criteria for metabolic syndrome have face validity, but
have not yet been formally validated or studied. Since
NHANES III was a cross-sectional study, we cannot infer
causality from these associations. These results should be
considered hypothesis-generating, which requires pro-
spective studies among those with diabetes to demon-
strate if those without the metabolic syndrome indeed
have a lower cardiovascular risk than those with the
syndrome. More recent studies have shown that there is a
continuing epidemic of diabetes and obesity and suggest
that NHANES III data, even adjusted for recent census
data, may be underestimating the prevalence of diabetes
and metabolic syndrome (31).
The prevalence of CHD markedly increases with pres-
ence of metabolic syndrome. Among people with diabetes,
prevalence of metabolic syndrome was very high, and
those with diabetes and metabolic syndrome had the
highest prevalence of CHD. Among all individuals with
diabetes, prevalence of CHD was increased compared to
those with metabolic syndrome without diabetes. How-
