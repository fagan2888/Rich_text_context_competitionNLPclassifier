Financial risk tolerance (FRT) refers to the retail investors' willingness to accept the
negative changes in the value of investment or an outcome that is adversely different
from the expected one. Understanding and assessing FRT plays a crucial role in indi-
vidual choices about wealth accumulation, portfolio allocation, and all other investment
and finance-related decisions, and in achieving financial goals. An advisor has to accu-
rately assess FRT for achieving his/her goal or investor's goal. Failure to do so leads
to the choice of an investment option/portfolio which is inconsistent with one's FRT,
resulting in investor disappointment, that is, unbearable loss to the client. Such a situa-
tion may adversely affect the client­advisor relationship.
Measuring FRT is challenging as it is a multidimensional attitude. Besides, it is an elusive
concept that appears to be influenced by a number of predisposing factors such as
demographic, environmental, and psychosocial factors. This study aims to identify the
factors that are related to risk tolerance from outside the financial services domain such
as psychology, economics, and bio-sociology. It deals most specifically with the relation-
ship between biopsychosocial factors and FRT. Those who are interested in assessing
and predicting FRT can move closer to a theoretical account that blends psycholog-
ical and economic insights and supplements the understanding of risk-taking attitudes
and behaviour of retail investors. Such an understanding will help financial advisors,
policy makers, and researchers in identifying the determinants of an individual's FRT to
suggest the suitable investment alternatives to their clients.
A single cross-sectional survey was conducted among 951 retail investors with various
levels of investment experience through a structured questionnaire covering a variety of
demographic factors. An analysis of the data collected through the questionnaire indi-
cates that all the three factors--self-esteem, personality type, and sensation seeking--
are positively related to FRT. This study adds to the extant literature on psychological
determinants of FRT.

118 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS AND FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
Any financial and investment decision-making
process requires four fundamental inputs,
namely goals, time horizon, financial stability,
and financial risk tolerance (Garman & Forgue, 2011).
While the first three inputs are relatively more objec-
tive in nature, financial risk tolerance (FRT) is highly
subjective (Larkin, Lucey, & Mulholland, 2013). FRT
refers to the retail investors' willingness to accept the
negative changes in the value of investment or an
outcome that is adversely different from the expected
one (Grable & Lytton, 1999).
Understanding and assessing FRT plays a crucial role in
individualchoicesaboutwealthaccumulation,portfolio
allocation, and all other investment and finance-related
decisions (Hanna, Gutter, & Fan, 2001) and in achieving
financial goals. An advisor has to accurately assess FRT
for achieving his/her goal or the investor's goal. This is
possible only if the advisor personally knows the client,
for example, high-net-worth individual (HNWI) inves-
tors, but it is challenging for them while considering
mass markets of small investors (Ardehali, Paradi, &
Asmild, 2005). Nevertheless, it is important to measure
FRT at best. Failure to do so leads to the choice of an
investment option/portfolio which is inconsistent with
one's FRT resulting in investor disappointment, that
is, unbearable loss to the client (Droms, 1987). Such a
situation may adversely affect the client­advisor rela-
tionship (Larkin et al., 2013). In addition, it leads to
an unfavourable impact on the advisor's career and
exposes him to litigation, arbitration, and legal jeop-
ardy (Grable, Roszkowski, Joo, O'Neill, & Lytton,
2009). This problem could be minimized by an investor
himself/herself measuring his/her FRT instead of FRT
being measured by others (i.e., advisors) as there is a
strong relationship between investment behaviour of an
individual and his/her FRT (Bailey & Kinerson, 2005;
Schooley & Worden, 1996).
Understanding the significance of measuring FRT
correctly, financial advisors have been giving impor-
tance to the behavioural aspects of an investor while
measuring FRT. Measuring FRT is challenging as it is
a multidimensional attitude. Besides, it is an elusive
concept that appears to be influenced by a number of
predisposing factors (Trone, Allbright, & Taylor, 1996)
such as demographic, environmental, and psychoso-
cial factors. The extant literature shows that among all
the factors, demographic characteristics are the most
widely investigated determinants of FRT (e.g., Grable
& Lytton, 1999; Grable, 1997; Moreschi, 2011; Wang &
Hanna, 1998). In addition, demographic characteristics
could be used to differentiate retail investors in terms
of FRT and classify them into different FRT categories
(Grable & Lytton, 1999). Nevertheless, there are several
other variables that may also be important determinants
of FRT, for example, personality (a psychological factor)
and genetics (a biological factor) of an individual.
Despite the importance of FRT in financial and invest-
ment decision-making, specific theory related to the
assessment and prediction of FRT is very limited (Hanna,
Gutter, & Fan, 1998), but theories related to non-finan-
cial decisions (i.e., use of drug and alcohol) widely exist.
For example, risk attitudes and behaviours of an adoles-
cent on the basis of predisposing factors were inves-
tigated by Irwin Jr (1993). He classified these factors
into two categories, namely environmental factors and
biopsychosocial factors. Environmental factors included
family situation, socioeconomic status, and social tran-
sitions. Biopsychosocial factors included birth order,
gender, personality traits, age, and ethnicity. As stated
above, the relationship between biopsychosocial factors
and FRT is a relatively unexplored area as compared to
demographic factors. One such important study was
conducted by Grable and Joo (2004). They adapted and
expanded Irwin's framework and tested it using predis-
posing factors as determinants of FRT of faculty and staff
of two universities. They found a significant association
between biopsychosocial factors and FRT. With respect
to psychological factors, extant literature shows that
personality (Carducci & Wong, 1998; Grable & Joo, 2004;
Mayfield, Perdue, & Wooten, 2008), sensation seeking
(Zuckerman, 1994; Carducci & Wong, 1998; Grable &
Joo, 2004), and self-esteem (Cohen, 2001; Grable & Joo,
2004) have a consistent positive relationship with FRT.
As FRT is dynamic in nature, it changes over time. In
addition, FRT is influenced by life experiences (Van de
Venter, 2006). In the recent past, experiences of retail
investors were severely affected by various financial
crises. For instance, the recent Greek crisis followed by
global meltdown has increased the financial vulnera-
bility of institutions as well as individuals. Individuals
rather than institutions have mostly experienced the
adverse impact of financial vulnerability by losing their
investments and jobs and facing salary cuts (Bricker,
Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, & Moore, 2011). Such scenario
changes may or may not pull down the risk appetite
of the financial advisors and investors. This empha-
sizes the need for continuous assessment and accurate
measurement of FRT to achieve the desired results (Yao,
Sharpe, & Wang, 2011).

CONTRIBUTION OF THE STUDY
There is no specific theory on the role of biopsychoso-
cial factors in the financial services domain. This study
aims to identify the factors that are related to risk toler-
ance from outside the financial services domain such
as psychology, economics, and bio-sociology. It deals
most specifically with the relationship between biopsy-
chosocial factors and FRT. This study is expected to add
value to the existing literature in a meaningful way.
Moreover, those who are interested in assessing and
predicting FRT can move closer to a theoretical account
that blends psychological and economic insights and
supplements the understanding of risk-taking atti-
tudes and behaviour of retail investors. Such an under-
standing will help financial advisors, policy makers,
and researchers in identifying the determinants of an
individual's FRT to suggest the suitable investment
alternatives to their clients.
LITERATURE REVIEW
Over the past three decades, capital market in India
has undergone various structural changes. A wide
variety of investment options has been thrown open
to the investors' community. With the proliferation of
investment options, the retail investors' community
has grown significantly in the recent years. The retail
investors may choose from a number of investment
options according to the level of FRT. Since then, finan-
cial advisors, policy makers, and researchers have
shown their keen interest in identifying the determi-
nants of an individual's FRT to suggest the suitable
investment alternatives to their clients. A number of
studies have investigated the role of demographic
factors as a determinant of FRT (Grable & Joo, 1999;
Grable & Lytton, 1999; Grable, 1997; Grable, McGill,
& Britt, 2011; Kannadhasan, 2006, 2015; Larkin et al.,
2013; Moreschi, 2011; Ryack, 2011; Sung & Hanna, 1996;
Wang & Hanna, 1998; Yao & Hanna, 2005). However,
there are other determinants such as financial consid-
erations, that is, the need for financial liquidity and
income security and personal considerations (Boone
& Kurtz, 1989; Widicus & Stitzel, 1989). There is no
specific theory on the role of biopsychosocial factors in
the financial services domain. Therefore, this section
discusses some of the most important factors that are
related to risk tolerance from outside the financial
services domain such as psychology, economics, and
bio-sociology.
Relationship between Self-Esteem and FRT
Self-esteem is an important personality trait and
acknowledged as a multidimensional trait as it encom-
passes several characteristics such as goodness, skill
and social competence, health, and worth (Baumeister,
Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003; Liao, Hunter, &
Weinman, 1995). It can be defined as `the perception
of self-worth, or the extent to which a person values,
prizes, or appreciates the self' (Blascovich & Tomaka,
1991). Self-esteem could be either positive or negative
and represents a favourable or unfavourable attitude
towards self (Rosenberg, 1965). An individual, who
possesses positive self-esteem, tends to take a higher
risk than those who have negative self-esteem (Arch,
1993; Krueger, & Dickson, 1994). As the outcome of any
investment decision will be known only in the future,
investors have necessarily to deal with the uncertainty
associated with their investment choice, which leads
to some level of anxiety, thereby, affecting their level of
self-esteem (Taylor, 1974). For instance, individuals who
have higher self-esteem are likely to be higher achievers
in all endeavours than those who have lower self-es-
teem, because their performance should be consistent
with their perceived self-image (Korman, 1976).
Similarly, the driving force behind individuals' pursuit
of wealth creation by choosing risky instruments is to
maintain their economic status, which is consistent with
their perceived self-worth (Bragues, 2005).
Self-esteem affects one's portfolio allocation, wealth
creation, and trading behaviour (Chatterjee, Finke, &
Harness, 2009). Retail investors, who have a higher level
of self-esteem, are able to cope with anxiety of experi-
encing losses, willing to invest in risky financial instru-
ments as well as instruments with which they do have
little knowledge, willingness to trade the instruments
that have poor performance, and so on (Chatterjee et al.,
2009). Individuals who have higher self-esteem never
regret even when they make bad investments, that is,
investing in under-performing investments as it lowers
their self-esteem (Arkes & Blumer, 1985). Similarly,
they are unwilling to admit their investment failure,
that is, `sell the stock/portfolio that had generated a
small loss than a stock/portfolio that had experienced a
more serious loss' (Tykocinski, Israel, & Pittman, 2004).
When considering demographic factors, it is observed
that men with a positive self-esteem would trade more
excessively than women with a higher self-esteem and
under-perform in investments (Barber & Odean, 2001).
Women are more pessimistic than men and attempt to
120 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS AND FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
mitigate the drop in their own self-esteem in the event
of investment failure (Mansour, Jouini, & Napp, 2006).
Individuals with positive self-esteem exhibit their will-
ingness to seek financial knowledge and financial
advice (Joo & Grable, 2001). Having financial educa-
tion/knowledge would help individuals to know their
financial situation and control their financial situation as
desired by themselves (Hogarth, Swenson, Gutenson, &
Nichols, 1995). Controlling these demographic factors
such as gender, education, age, income, net worth, and
financial knowledge, several studies have found that
self-esteem is a significant as well as a positive predictor
of FRT (Cohen, 2001; Grable, Britt, & Webb, 2008; Grable
& Joo, 2004;). Therefore, it is expected that:
H
1
: Self-esteem is positively related to FRT.
Relationship between Personality and FRT
The internal (psychological) and external environment
affects an individual's human behaviour (Endler &
Edwards, 1986) and thereby his decisions. Personality
type plays a significant role in determining investor
behaviour (Maital, Filer, & Simon, 1986; Sadi, Asl,
Rostami, Gholipour, & Gholipour, 2011). According
to Myers­Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) personality
theory, every person has inborn preferences that
define how he or she will behave in a certain situation
(Pittenger, 1993). Pompian and Longo (2004) suggested
that investment advisors must consider an investor's
personality type in client profiling. Further, they can
use it for suggesting suitable investment options
(Pompian & Longo, 2004). For instance, retail investors
can be grouped into two groups, viz., passive or active
to help investment advisers to understand the nature
of their clients and suggest suitable options (Barnewall,
1987). Typically, passive investors are those who earn
money without putting a great effort and earn wealth
by risking the capital of others. Conversely, active
investors like to earn wealth by risking their own
capital. In simple words, active investors have more
tolerance for risk than passive investors (Barnewall,
1987). Previous studies have investigated the relation-
ship between personality traits and investment deci-
sions and found a relationship between personality
and FRT (Barnewall, 1987; Bashir, Azam, Butt, Javed,
& Tanvir, 2013; Carducci & Wong, 1998; Droms, 1987;
Eaker & Castelli, 1988; Grable & Joo, 2004; Grable et
al., 2008; Mayfield et al., 2008; Pittenger, 1993; Pompian
& Longo, 2004; Price, 1982; Thoresen & Low, 1990;
Zuckerman & Kuhlman, 2000).
There are many ways of classifying people's personal-
ities such as the five-way model, MBTI, and Type A/B
traits method. In this study, Type A/B traits method
is used to measure the retail investor's personality.
Type A personality generally refers to the individuals,
who are competitive, with an underlying tendency for
hostility and aggressiveness, a sense of time urgency
and impatience (Grable, 2000; Strube, 1991; Thoresen
& Low, 1990). Conversely, Type B refers to the individ-
uals who are a contrast to those with Type A person-
ality. Individuals with Type A personality trait tend
to take greater risks than those more closely aligned
with the Type B personality profile (Carducci & Wong,
1998). In addition, Type A individuals tend to pursue
tangible accomplishments as a measure of one's well-
being/worth because the society values only material
success. In this pursuit, they try to achieve more mate-
rial success than others (Type B individuals) with less
concern for one's perceived personal limits (Price, 1982).
Type A individuals are more financial risk tolerant than
Type B individuals as they are associated with higher
levels of income (Thoresen & Low, 1990) and higher
level of education, financial knowledge, and occupa-
tional status (Carducci & Wong, 1998; Grable, 2000). For
instance, a higher level of income gives a kind of finan-
cial security and makes it possible for Type A individ-
uals to take greater financial risks than Type B individ-
uals (Carducci & Wong, 1998). Very few studies have
examined the relationship between personality and
FRT by classifying investors into Type A/B category. A
few studies have found that Type A individuals tend to
be more risk tolerant than Type B individuals (Carducci
& Wong, 1998; Grable & Joo, 2004). It is expected that:
H
2
: 
Type A investors have more Financial Risk
Tolerance than Type B investors.
Relationship between Sensation Seeking (SS) and
FRT
Sensation seeking is yet another important trait which is
consistently related with FRT (Wong & Carducci, 1991).
Sensation seeking is defined as `the seeking of varied,
novel, complex, and intense sensations and experiences,
and the willingness to take physical risks for the sake of
such experiences' (Zuckerman, 1994). In simple words,
this type of behaviour is `due to the biochemical reac-
tions in the brain' (Larsen & Buss, 2008). Typically, an
individual who has higher sensation seeking accepts
risk as a possible outcome for attaining the desired level
of excitement and stimulation (Zuckerman & Kuhlman,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 121
1978). Such an individual tends to bet high and at higher
odds in gambling for increasing the level of arousal
(Anderson&Brown,1984).Thistraitrelatestothebehav-
ioural expressions that are generally described as risky
such as high-risk sports, gambling, substance usage,
risky sexual experiences, alcohol use, holiday prefer-
ences (Roberti, 2004; Zuckerman, 1979; Zumdick, 2007).
Individuals with such a trait also exhibit a propensity
to make risky financial investments (Harlow & Brown,
1990). A few studies have investigated the relationship
of sensation seeking with financial management behav-
iour, especially the use of credit card in particular (e.g.,
Henry, Weber, & Yarbrough, 2001; Miller, 2001; Popham,
Kennison, & Bradley, 2011; Worthy, Jonkman, & Blinn-
Pike, 2010). They found that students exhibited risky
financial behaviour such as accumulating more debt,
overdrawing their accounts, borrowing money from
their friends to pay their bills and so on. Nevertheless,
a very limited number of studies explored the relation-
ship between sensation seeking and FRT. Carducci and
Wong (1991) concluded that higher sensation seekers
would exhibit greater financial risk-taking tenden-
cies. Further, they stated that men engaged in financial
risk-taking more than women. In the similar line, the
general trait of sensation seeking has some predictive
value for financial risk behaviour (Grable & Joo, 2004;
Horvath & Zuckerman, 1993). Therefore, it is expected
that:
H
3
: Sensation Seeking is positively related to FRT.
RESEARCH MODEL
This article has conceptualized the research model with
the help of extant literature (Figure 1). The proposed
relationships were examined using Partial Least
Square-Path Modelling (PLS-PM).
Methodology
Procedure and Sample
Tounderstandtherelationshipbetweenbiopsychosocial
factors and FRT, the study used single cross-sectional
survey research. The data were collected through
structured questionnaire (see Appendix) in Raipur,
the capital city of Chhattisgarh, India. A total of
985 responses were collected by using a purposive
sampling method from retail investors, who had
experience in investing in the capital market. To ensure
the appropriateness and validity of the scales, the
researchers conducted a pilot study. In addition, the
researchers had a discussion with financial advisors
before conducting the final survey. Since the survey
instrumentwasinEnglish,theresearchershadrequested
the respondents to seek clarification from them if they
did not understand any part of the questionnaire. Even
though the majority of the respondents were able to
read and understand English, some respondents sought
clarifications and the same had been clarified by the
researchers for enhancing the quality of responses. In
order to minimize the limitations of sampling method,
the study employed a large sample size. Out of 985
responses, 34 responses were incomplete and hence
were discarded. Finally, the study used 951 responses
to achieve the objective of the study. The average age
and income of the respondents were 35.19 years and
INR 8.36 lakhs per annum respectively. Out of 951,
674 respondents were male and the rest were female;
61.30 per cent of the respondents were single and
38.70 per cent were married. With regard to education,
206 respondents were professionals (MBA, CA, etc.)
and 745 were non-professionals (B.Sc, B.Com, M.Sc,
M.Com, etc.); 67.50 per cent of the respondents were
salaried individuals. The summary of demographic
characteristics is given in Table 1.

Measurement
Dependent Variable
Assessment of the client's risk preferences has now
become an essential step in developing investment
policy statement (IPS). It has also become essential
to document the same prior to making an invest-
ment and subsequent financial planning recommen-
dations to the clients. Despite the importance of FRT
in making optimal financial decisions (Moreschi,
2004), the regulators of the financial market have not
yet defined the term explicitly (Roszkowski, Davey,
& Grable, 2005), and hence, FRT has been measured
in diverse ways in practice (Van de Venter, 2006). For
instance, some financial advisors measure FRT using
proxies--either demographic characteristics or qual-
itative heuristics or combination of the both. Others
use psychometrically designed FRT scales (Grable
et al., 2009). Anecdotal evidence suggests that using
the psychometric scale would exhibit FRT relatively
better than the demographic factors. In addition,
financial advisers are warned about the potential
dangers of using single items of any sort (Callan &
Johnson, 2002). Therefore, it was suggested that
assessing FRT using multi-items as well as psycho-
metrically designed scale with an appropriate level
of reliability and validity would be better (Callan &
Johnson, 2002; Corter & Chen, 2006; Roszkowski et
al., 2005;). This study preferred to use such a scale for
measuring FRT. Measuring one's FRT could be done
by advisors or oneself. However, it was suggested that
individuals could best measure their FRT more accu-
rately than the advisors (Hallahan, Faff, & McKenzie,
2004). In addition, investment behaviour of an indi-
vidual reflects the level of one's FRT which is meas-
ured by him/her, that is, self-assessment (Bailey &
Kinerson, 2005; Schooley & Worden, 1996). Therefore,
this study used a self-type measurement of FRT using
five items on a 4-point scale that was developed by the
researchers based on four risk assessment concepts as
suggested by Maccrimmon and Wehrung (1986) and
tested by Grable and Joo (2004). Responses are coded
as 1, 2, 3, and 4 for strongly agree, tend to agree, tend
to disagree, and strongly disagree respectively. Higher
scores indicate higher FRT and vice versa.
Independent Variables
There are three variables namely sensation seeking,
personality type (A/B), and self-esteem. All the three
variables were measured on a 4-point scale as is the
case with FRT. The self-esteem scale was developed by
Rosenberg (1965) with 10 items. Higher scores indicate
positive self-esteem and vice versa. Type A/B person-
ality scale was developed by Grable and Joo (2004) with
six items. However, they were adapted and modified
from Eaker and Castelli (1988). A higher score indicated
a greater likelihood of exhibiting type `A' personality
traits. Sensation seeking was measured using five items
that were developed by Grable and Joo (2004). However,
they were adapted from Arnett (1994) as is with type
`A' personality. The reliability score of these variables
is above 0.718, which is above the minimum threshold
level for a variable (Nunnally, 1978). Therefore, all the
constructs have good reliability (see Table 2). Similarly,
all the variables have convergent validity, which was
verified by calculating Average Variance Extracted
(AVE) value. Generally, constructs which have AVE
greater than 0.50 (Hair & Black, 2006) or have AVE close
enough to 0.50 are considered to have a good conver-
gent validity (Cohen, 2001).

The discriminant validity was tested by examining
the square root of the AVE that exceeds the inter-cor-
relation of the construct with the other constructs or
squared correlation between the constructs which
should be less than the AVE (Fornell & Larcker, 1981;
Hair & Black, 2006). All the constructs have good discri-
minant validity (Table 3). Therefore, the measurement
model was considered satisfactory with the evidence of
adequate reliability and validity of constructs.

the relationship of biopsychosocial factors with FRT
using Smart PLS Software. In addition, the study esti-
mated the Global Fit measures for path modelling to
validate the model globally.

Structural Model Results
The study used PLS-SEM to examine the relationship
between biopsychosocial factors and FRT. PLS-PM is
a variance-based approach for assessing the interrela-
tions of all the constructs simultaneously (Chin, 1998).
In addition, PLS makes no assumptions on distribu-
tional requirements. The structural model was evalu-
ated using the R-square for the dependent constructs
and the size, t-statistics, and significance for the path
coefficients. Path coefficients in PLS are standardized
regression coefficients (Staples, Hulland, & Higgins,
1998). In order to assess whether path coefficients are
statistically significant or not, bootstrap procedures are
used to estimate standard errors for calculating t-values
(Fornell & Barclay, 1983). The results are examined at 5
per cent significance level and the t-statistic value at the
0.05 level is 1.96. If the t-statistic value is greater than
1.96, the path is significant (Efron, 1979; Efron & Gong,
1983). Results from PLS-PM are given in Table 8 and
Figure 2. Three variables namely self-esteem, personality
type, and sensation seeking are positively related with
FRT. In addition, these relationships are statistically signif-
icant at 5 per cent level.
Analysis of Global Fit Measures
The study also conducted Global Fit (GoF) measure for
path modelling (Tenenhaus, Vinzi, Chatelin, & Lauro,
2005) as it may serve as a cut-off value for global vali-
dation (Wetzels, Odekerken-Schroder, & Van Oppen,
2009). GoF is defined as the geometric mean of the
AVE and average R2. The GoF value of this study is
0.1983, that is, 19.83 per cent for the complete model
that exceeds the small effect size of R2. This model has
reasonable explaining power in comparison with the
baseline values of explaining power (GoF
small
= 0.1,
GoF
medium
= 0.25, and GoF
large
= 0.36). Therefore, this
study concludes that the model has adequate support
to validate the PLS model globally (Wetzels et al., 2009).
DISCUSSION
Self-esteem is positively related to FRT and is a signifi-
cant predictor of FRT. This result is similar to Horvath
and Zuckerman (1993), Grable and Joo (2004), Grable
et al. (2008), and Chatterjee et al. (2009). As pointed out
by Lazarus (1991), individuals with higher self-esteem
do follow a two-stage assessment process in invest-
ment decision-making. In the first stage, they assess
the outcome of the decision which is positive or nega-
tive. Second, they assess their knowledge in managing
their investments efficiently and effectively. This is
possible for only individuals with higher self-esteem
as they have the ability to collect the necessary infor-
mation and develop an appropriate strategy to achieve
their desired goal. Moreover, this capability gives
a greater confidence in their ability to invest which
alleviates the fear of a possible loss. If an individual
perceives the expected benefits to exceed the cost of
investment in terms of time and utility, an individual
with higher self-esteem assumes a greater likelihood of

success over time (Taylor, 1974) and accumulate more
wealth. It helps maintain their self-image and self-
worth. Conversely, individuals with lower self-esteem
prefer to invest in safe and tangible assets, which tend
to under-perform over a period of time (Chatterjee et
al., 2009). On the other hand, individuals with a higher
self-esteem would lose all their wealth through their
sub-optimal behaviour as they may be over-confident
of their knowledge and assessment. This adverse result
would result in a drop in their self-esteem that follows a
negative outcome resulting in the reduction in the level
of risk-taking (Chatterjee et al., 2009). This emphasizes
the need for correct assessment of their self-esteem.
Otherwise, it would lead to sub-optimal decisions.
The financial service industry should note that lack
of understanding of self-esteem could be an impor-
tant obstacle to the achievement of long-term financial
success and for maintaining the client relationship.
Personality type is another significant predictor of FRT.
The results are similar to those of Carducci and Wong
(1998) and in contrast to those of Grable and Joo (2004).
Individuals who belong to Personality Type A cate-
gory are usually competitive in nature and are always
concerned about their personal achievement (Ray &
Bozek, 1980). Such individualities not only bring recog-
nition for the community (Houston & Snyder, 1988), but
also mediate willingness of the individuals to take risk
(Carducci & Wong, 1998). `As financial success is propor-
tional, to some degree, to financial risk taken, Type A
individuals would be more willing to take greater finan-
cial risks to achieve financial success and the recogni-
tion such success would bring' (Carducci & Wong,
1998). In addition, Type A individuals usually have
higher income level than Type B individuals (Thoresen
& Low, 1990), which is another reason for having more
FRT. However, individuals/advisors need to evaluate
their financial security status carefully because over-
stating one's position motivates one to choose risky
financial investment options, thereby destroying one's
wealth. Advisors need to recognize the consciousness of
personality in terms of their managing ability in rela-
tion to financial and investment decisions because it
is related to the way individuals think and act in the
environment. Mismatching the personality and invest-
ment options would destroy the wealth of one's clients.
Another trait dealt in this study is sensation seeking.
This study finds that individuals with a higher level of
sensation seeking tend to take more financial risk. This
finding is similar to that of Carducci and Wong (1991)

126 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS AND FINANCIAL RISK TOLERANCE: AN EMPIRICAL STUDY
and in contrast to Grable and Joo (2004). Individuals
who have a higher sensation seeking exhibit a propen-
sity to make risky financial investments.
Thus, the results of the study confirm the proposition
made by Irwin (1993) with regard to determinants of
FRT, biopsychosocial factors in particular. As hypothe-
sized, this study finds that the biopsychosocial factors
are positively associated with FRT. It indicates that an
investor who has a higher level of sensation seeking
and self-esteem and has Type A personality tends to be
more risk-tolerant.
SUMMARY
The most prudent approach to asset allocation is to
assess and integrate two types of information, namely,
the capital market-related factors and the inves-
tors' FRT. In real life, the self-perceived FRT might be
different from the objective measurement of FRT as
the objective measurement of FRT varies with age. It is
plausible that an individual's subjective (psychometric
measurement) FRT does not change with age (Hanna
& Chen, 1997). In recent years, financial planners have
often preferred to use psychometric assessment of FRT
to provide better services to the clients. This motivates
the researchers to explore the relationship between
biopsychosocial factors and FRT to identify the factors
that determine FRT. To achieve this objective, this study
used three biopsychosocial factors namely self-esteem,
personality type, and sensation seeking. Findings of the
study suggest that biopsychosocial factors are related
to FRT. This study suggests to the practitioners, finan-
cial planners, and policy makers that consideration of
these three factors would enhance the understanding of
the client in a better manner rather than relying on only
demographic factors. However, use of demographic
variables and contextual variables along with biopsy-
chosocial variables is suggested. It is because a small
variation in any factor would be useful in preventing
the wrong asset allocation decisions.
IMPLICATIONS
Incorrect measurement of FRT may lead to the choice of
incorrect investment options, which in turn may lead to
the diminution in the wealth and welfare of investors
As a result one may sell a good investment or invest
in an incorrect portfolio, which are not good for finan-
cial service providers. It will affect their credibility and
reputation and result in loss of customers, and so on.
SCOPE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH
A further research could consider other variables such
as racial background, financial satisfaction, net-worth,
home ownership, birth order, age, gender, education,
marital status, family relationship, the number of
dependents, and income along with the biopsychoso-
cial factors. Future research could also consider finan-
cial knowledge, financial satisfaction, and income level
because knowledgeable individuals who possess a
higher level of income and education have a greater
FRT as pointed out by Grable & and Joo (2004).
