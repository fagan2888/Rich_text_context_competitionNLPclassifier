Special Issue - Student Diversity
Culturally and Linguistically Diverse
(CLD) Students and Learning
Disabilities (LDs)
LDs are among the most researched developmental disor-
ders, but it remains unclear what exactly a LD is and what
causes it. This may explain the variety of definitions of LD
(e.g., Individuals With Disabilities Education Improvement
Act [IDEIA], 2004; Reid & Valle, 2004; Stanovich, 1994);
the prevalence of LD among student populations internation-
ally, fluctuating from 4% to 30% (Lambert & Sandoval,
1980; Sarkees-Wircenski & Scott, 2003; Shaywitz, Morris,
& Shaywitz, 2008); and the disproportionate representation
of CLD students in LD (Artiles, Kozleski, Trent, Osher, &
Ortiz, 2010; Coutinho, Oswald, & Best, 2002; Morgan et al.,
2015; Sullivan, 2011).
Most LD definitions do not include learning problems
that are primarily the result of visual, hearing, or motor dis-
abilities; of mental retardation; of emotional disturbance; or
of environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage
(IDEIA, 2004). However, according to research data, dispro-
portionate representation in LD occurs mainly in vulnerable
social groups, such as those with low socioeconomic status
(SES) and CLD students (Coutinho & Oswald, 2005; Field,
Jette, & Martin, 2006). Consequently, students from vulner-
able social groups are being placed in special education, cat-
egorized as having LDs, intellectual disabilities, or
behavioral-emotional disorders.
In the United States, during the school year 1998-1999,
about 2.8 million CLD students aged 6 years to 21 years
were diagnosed with LDs, slightly more than 50% of all stu-
dents referred for disabilities and special needs (Coutinho
et al., 2002). Moreover, in a nationally representative U.S.
sample of high-school students, data indicated that CLD stu-
dents were more likely to be identified as manifesting a LD
(Shifrer, Muller, & Callahan, 2011). To note, among CLD
students, the LD percentage rates increased whereas rates of
students with intellectual disabilities decreased (Coutinho
et al., 2002). A similar pattern was identified in the general

Representation of Culturally and
Linguistically Diverse Students Among
Students With Learning Disabilities: A
Greek Paradigm

Abstract
Ongoing research has demonstrated that culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students may be disproportionately
represented among students with learning disabilities (LDs). The main aim of this research was to identify groups of CLD
students at risk for LDs using the achievement criterion. To that end, 158 students participated in the current research:
78 Greeks and 80 Pontian Greeks from the former Soviet Union (Greek FSU-Pontian). Research findings indicated that
the use of the achievement criterion alone is inadequate to accurately identify a student being at risk for LDs, given that
CLD students' language competence and achievement are low mainly due to their bilingualism and that language acquisition
competence is positively associated to language achievement. Professional judgments based on psychoeducational evaluation
data are used to classify a student as having a LD. Professional judgment is presented as a possible explanation for the
disproportionate representation of CLD students among students with LDs.

student population with the rates of students identified as
learning disabled increasing over the years (U.S. Department
of Education, National Center for Education Statistics,
2000). According to the Office of Special Education
Programs (2007), the numbers of students from vulnerable
social groups placed in special education increased by 6% to
6.9% from 1993 to 2007.
Cummins (1996) associated CLD students' academic dif-
ficulties with their overrepresentation in special education.
After the 1990s, research findings in the United States and
European Union (EU) countries indicated that CLD students
exhibited low language achievement and high rates of school
dropout, and were classified in lower ability groups than
native-speaking students (Luciak, 2004; Luciak & Binder,
2004; Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and
Development [OECD], 2000; Ruiz-de-Velasco & Fix, 2000).
In a synthesis of research findings, focused on Spanish-
speaking students of low SES, language competence was
positively associated with literacy along with a concomitant
reduction in students' comprehension and writing skills
(Genesee, Lindholm-Leary, Saunders, & Christian, 2005).
Overrepresentation of these students in LD has puzzled
experts because (a) students may be referred to special edu-
cation in response to issues other than LDs, for instance, lim-
ited second language competence, and (b) the identification
process may be inconsistent.
Other research findings, by contrast, indicate that CLD
students are underrepresented in LD (Hibel, Farkas, &
Morgan, 2010). This underrepresentation may be associated
with lack of access to mental health services or fear of stig-
matization (Zuckerman et al., 2014). Furthermore, research
findings have indicated that minority students experience
systematic victimization and prejudice that leads to their
characterization as problematic and atypical (Hays, Prosek,
& McLeod, 2010). Similar research findings are reported in
Greece (Maniatis, Nikolaou, & Papadopoulos, 2009; Psalti
& Konsantinou, 2007). According to recent research data
(Morgan, Farkas, Hillemeier, & Maczuga, 2012), the per-
centages of CLD students with LDs are low in kindergarten
and the first three primary school grades and increase from
the fourth grade onward when educational demands become
greater. Morgan et al. (2012) also claimed that the learning-
cognitive profiles of CLD students and native-speaking stu-
dents of low SES do not appear very different from each
other, so that they equally likely to be considered at risk for
developmental disorders. Under IDEIA (2004), the LD diag-
nosis should exclude social, economic, and cultural disad-
vantaged conditions, inadequate instructional opportunities,
or limited language competence; however, some LD defini-
tions include these conditions, possibly leading to dispropor-
tionate representation patterns (Algozzine & Ysseldyke,
1986; Fletcher, Denton, & Francis, 2005).
A common linking factor between CLD students and LDs
is the type of language competence expected in schools.
From the 1960s, it was noted that children from vulnerable
social groups--particularly low-SES and CLD children--
underperform compared with their middle-class, White
classmates. This was attributed to low-SES and CLD stu-
dents' different--but not deficient--language skills, and to a
mismatch between children's language skills and the type of
language competence expected in schools (Hoff, 2013).
Underperformance of low-SES and CLD children is also due
to the distinction between limited language competence, and
LD is not easily detected. In a research review, it was found
that CLD students who had been identified with a LD by
their school seemed to be experiencing learning difficulties
for reasons other than disability (Wilkinson, Ortiz, Robertson,
& Kushner, 2006). It is difficult to assess CLD students' lan-
guage competence, which, if poor, can sometimes be inter-
preted as a sign of low ability, low school achievement, or
LDs (Collier, 2011; Hoff, 2013). This may be attributed to
the types of assessment tools used (Samson & Lesaux, 2009)
and to LD diagnosis, which is not only based on measure-
ments but also on judgments made by professionals (Waber,
2010). Additional social and demographic risk factors for a
LD diagnosis for CLD students may include poverty and
limited access to appropriate school education (Harry,
Arnaiz, Klingner, & Sturges, 2008; Hays et al.,2010; Oswald,
Coutinho, & Best, 2000).
As regards teachers' assessments on students for disabil-
ity, Scott, Boynton Hauerwas, and Brown (2014) argued that
the process for determining whether students' difficulties are
due to second language acquisition is not well understood or
applied by schoolteachers, especially as regards the imple-
mentation of Response to Intervention (RtI; Orosco &
Klingner, 2010). Research findings from Greece indicate that
to evaluate both Greek and CLD students for disability,
schoolteachers mainly give emphasis on students' school
achievement, which may not be considered as the most
appropriate form of evaluation (Tzouriadou, Vouyoukas,
Anagnostopoulou, & Menexes, in press).
LDs Assessment Models
Until 2004, three basic models were employed worldwide
for LD diagnosis: the ability-achievement discrepancy
model, the low achievement model, and the intraindividual
discrepancy model. The classic model of LD diagnosis is the
ability-achievement discrepancy model, which aligns with
the archetypal notion of LD. Once a student is identified with
low achievement without the primal interference of environ-
mental factors (e.g., behavior, family, social), a specific
degree of difference between intellectual ability and perfor-
mance must be established to classify that student with LDs
(Kavale, Kauffman, Bachmeier, & LeFever, 2008). This
model has been criticized because it does not differentiate
the group of students identified with LDs by the discrepancy
model from the low achievers (Shinn, 2007). The low
achievement model, in which any student unexpectedly per-
forming below a certain threshold can be identified with
Vouyoukas et al. 3
LDs, has also been widely criticized, mainly because it was
associated with the tendency to overrepresentation of CLD
students (Fletcher et al., 2005). It has also been criticized for
not facilitating the identification of high ability students with
LDs or average achievement (Giovingo, Proctor, & Prevatt,
2005). The intraindividual discrepancy model compares spe-
cific cognitive areas of individual students. It is based on the
psychology of individual differences psychometric criteria
and is mainly used by clinicians to apply prescribed interven-
tions. An uneven student profile with strengths in some areas
and weaknesses in other suggests a LD, whereas a flat profile
is an indicator of expected underachievement. This model is
also criticized for leading to overrepresentation patterns
among CLD students in special education (Fletcher et al.,
2005).
After 2004, in the United States, the model of RtI was
included in the LD diagnostic process (Fuchs & Fuchs,
2006). RtI is a multitiered system of supports, according to
which systematic evaluation and intensive individualized
instruction are given to refer or not students to special educa-
tion settings. RtI has been recommended for practitioners
who are interested in minority over- or underrepresentation
in special education as a viable method to assess minority
students (Cohen, Burns, Riley-Tillman, & Hosp, 2015).
However, this model also does not avoid the risk of CLD
students' disproportionate representation in the numbers of
learning disabled students (Orosco & Klingner, 2010).
The Greek Paradigm
Since the 1990s, Greece has become host to many CLD
groups, both to immigrants and to repatriated Greeks. Most
of the immigrants have arrived from Albania, and the vast
majority of the repatriated Greeks have arrived from the for-
mer Soviet Union (Luciak, 2004). Most of the repatriated are
Pontians, a group of ancient Greek origin mostly settled
along the coast of the Black Sea, who migrated to the Russian
Empire over the years of Ottoman domination where they
continued to live through the 1990s (Chatzissavidis, 2012).
The migration wave has been associated with sociopolitical
changes in Eastern Europe, including the reformation of
Soviet Union and the opening of borders to EU countries
(Diamanti-Karanou, 2003). Like most immigrants and repa-
triated individuals around the world, immigrants and repatri-
ated individuals in Greece face economic and social
difficulties. Most immigrants are not competent in the Greek
language and have not attended the Greek educational
system.
The same applies to the Pontian Greeks from the former
Soviet Union (Greek FSU-Pontian), as neither they nor their
recent ancestors had lived in Greece. Immigrants and repatri-
ated individuals in Greece are mostly unemployed or semiem-
ployed, experience communication difficulties with the native
speakers, and settle in underprivileged and low-SES areas
(Kasimati, 1998; Markou, 1997). Like their parents, the
students from such backgrounds have insufficient knowledge
of the Greek language, as they prefer speaking the language of
the country of origin at home and to communicate mostly with
their compatriot peers (Papastylianou, 1998). The languages
Greek FSU-Pontian use to communicate on a daily basis are
the Pontian dialect or/and the Russian language. The Pontian
dialect is the language used by the Greek FSU-Pontian, which
has been spoken in the region from ancient times through the
1920s and continues to be in use by the descendants of those
residents mainly in Greece (Chatzissavidis, 2012). The Greek
FSU-Pontian families use the Greek-Pontial dialect and the
Russian language in their everyday communication, whereas
in school their children speak Greek. In this way, the Greek
FSU-Pontian children are both diglossic and bilingual, as they
use a Greek dialect and Russian as primary languages, whereas
Modern Greek is the language of formal education and is used
for written and formal spoken purposes (Chatzissavidis, 2012;
Nikolaou, 2011).
From 1994 onward, EU-funded research projects were
developed to meet immigrant and repatriated students'educa-
tional and social needs in Greece. The main research projects
developed between 1994 and 2013 were "Teacher Training
Programs for Teaching Greek to Immigrant and Repatriated
Students, 1994-1995"; "Integration of Repatriated and
Foreign Students at Schools, 1997-2013"; and "Repatriated
and Foreign Students in Greek Education,A& B 2003-2004."
These research projects documented the immigrant and repa-
triated student population; identified their language, aca-
demic, and social needs; and set up various educational and
teaching methods for meeting these needs. Data from these
research projects formed the Greek policy that first intro-
duced intercultural segregated schools (Law 2413, 1996) and
more recently developed remedial Greek-language courses in
general education settings for CLD students (Anastasiadi-
Simeonidi, 2007).
According to the latest published statistics of the Greek
Institute of Intercultural Education (Instituto Paideias
Omogenon & Diapolitismikis Ekpaideusis [IPODE], 2010),
from a total of 568,797 students attending primary schools in
Greece, 10.25% were immigrants and 9.92% were repatri-
ated, of whom 15.54% of immigrants and the 47.95% of the
repatriated were in the Greek region of Central Macedonia,
northern Greece. Similarly, half of the repatriated students
were enrolled in schools in Central Macedonia. According to
Kogkidou, Tressou-Milona, and Tsiakalos (1997), most repa-
triated families live in the western industrial and underprivi-
leged city districts of Thessaloniki, the largest city of northern
Greece and traditionally home to ethnic and religious minor-
ities, such as Roma and Muslims. The rest are scattered
around Greece. Despite the EU research projects, published
empirical studies on CLD students in Greece are limited and
are mainly related to their difficulties in school adaptation
and participation (e.g., Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf, &
Masten, 2012; Motti-Stefanidi, Pavlopoulos, Obradovic, &
Masten, 2008; Psalti, 2000). For this reason, there are no
4 SAGE Open
published records of CLD students' low achievement; pri-
marily, there is no published research for those CLD students
attending primary Greek education (Damanakis, 1997;
Diakogeorgiou, 1994; Kessidou, 2008; Kogkidou et al.,
1997). Nonempirical Greek studies have suggested that CLD
students' school difficulties can be attributed to bilingualism
and low parental expectations (Fillipardou, 1997), which
may explain CLD students' high dropout rate from second-
ary education (Vakalios, 1999). Other empirical Greek stud-
ies have associated the difficulties CLD students encounter
at school with their poor language competence, as well as
low SES and poverty (Tzouriadou et al., 2007; Tzouriadou,
Koutsou, Kidoniatou, Stagiopoulos, & Tzelepi, 2000). To
date, no Greek research study has revealed any association
between CLD students' low school achievement and LD
classification. This may be attributed to an overgeneraliza-
tion tendency in interpreting the Law of Special Education
(Law 1566, 1985, Article 3), according to which bilingual
students should not be classified as pupils with LDs because
of their bilingualism. For the aforementioned reasons, in
Greece, there are no available data on the possible dispropor-
tionate representation of CLD students in LDs.
Research Questions
To better understand the representation patterns among CLD
students in the disability category of LDs, the following
research questions are being addressed in this study:
Research Question 1: What are the differences between
CLD students and their Greek counterparts in terms of
language acquisition competence and language achieve-
ment, when provided with the same educational opportu-
nities and belonging to the same SES background?
Research Question 2: What is the association between lan-
guage acquisition competence and language achievement?
Method
Participants
The research sample included 239 students who, according
to their teachers, had LDs, particularly in reading and writ-
ing. Students were in Grades 4 to 6 at public primary schools
in underprivileged and low-SES neighborhoods in the west-
ern part of Thessaloniki. The standardized Greek version of
Detroit Test of Learning Aptitude (DTLA-4; Hammill &
Bryant, 2005; Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, Toutountzi, &
Psoinos, 2008) was administered to these students, 45 of
whom were shown to have a general learning aptitude quo-
tient (GlearnAQ) of <70 with no intraindividual differences
and considered at risk of intellectual disabilities (American
Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities
[AAIDD], 2008). The other 194 students had a GlearnAQ of
approximately 80, which is DTLA-4 benchmark for average
aptitude quotient (Hammill & Bryant, 2005; Tzouriadou,
Anagnostopoulou, et al., 2008a). Out of the 194 students, 78
were Greek and 116 were CLD students. Among the CLD
students, 36 were Albanians, Roma, or from other countries
outside Greece, and 80 were Greek FSU-Pontian. Greek
FSU-Pontian students were selected because they are the
largest group of CLD students and, as mentioned above, they
are mainly concentrated in the low-SES areas ofThessaloniki,
northern Greece. Therefore, the study sample consisted of
158 students: 78 Greeks and 80 Greek FSU-Pontian. All par-
ticipants were either born in Greece or had been in the Greek
educational system for at least 4 years (Cummins, 1996; see
Table 1).
Measures
DTLA-4. GlearnAQ was assessed by administering the Greek
version of DTLA-4, which is standardized on the general
Greek population, including CLD students, to children aged 8
years to 15 years 11 months. It consists of nine subtests, which
provide a general learning acquisition composite and contrast-
ing domain composite scores (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou,
et al., 2008). Language, attention, and manual dexterity tasks
form verbal­nonverbal, attention enhanced­attention reduced,
and motor enhanced­motor reduced composite scores. This
particular test was chosen because the composite scores of
verbal­nonverbal indicate signs of LD. This test holds evi-
dence of content validity and construct validity, including con-
vergent and divergent validity (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou,
et al., 2008). Internal consistency reliability coefficients range
from .87 to .95 for the domain composites and are .98 for the
overall composite (Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, et al.,
2008).
--T- (Lato) Language Acquisition Competence Test.Greek
language acquisition competence was assessed by adminis-
tering the --T- (Lato) Language Acquisition Competence
Test, Level II (Tzouriadou, Sigkollitou, Anagnostopoulou, &
Vakola, 2008). As there were no language psychometric tests
for use in Greek, the --T- was developed and standard-
ized in the Greek language using a representative sample of
Greek and CLD students. The --T- is a language acquisi-
tion test that measures the acquisition process on two levels
(Level I: 4 years to 7 years 11 months and Level II: 8 years to

modalities: conceptual, morphological, and phonological.
Internal consistency reliability coefficients range from .82 to
.86 for the domain composites and are .96 for the overall
composite (Tzouriadou, Sigkollitou, et al., 2008). Evidence
of content and construct validity, including convergent and
divergent validity, has been demonstrated (Tzouriadou, Sig-
kollitou, et al., 2008). The size of the observed correlations
between --T- language acquisition composites and
DTLA-4 domains revealed congruent validity (Tzouriadou,
Anagnostopoulou, et al., 2008; Tzouriadou, Sigkollitou,
et al., 2008).
Achievement testing.Students' language achievement was
assessed with an informal test developed by schoolteachers
according to the Greek language school curriculum for
Grades 4 to 6 and measured the following language ele-
ments: story retelling, reading comprehension, grammar,
syntax, vocabulary, and spelling (Cronbach's  = .84). This
test is used by schoolteachers to measure Greek and CLD
students'language achievement. Objective scoring standards
to assess language achievement were developed. A score of
100 was the maximum possible score for each language ele-
ment. Language achievement element scores were converted
to t scores to enable correlation compatibility with the stan-
dardized language acquisition composites of the --T-
Language Competence Test, Level II.
Procedure
For the data to be collected, written permission was obtained
from students' parents prior to the assessment procedure.
Data collection was initiated in February 2014 and was com-
pleted in May 2015. In the first stage, the DTLA-4 was
administered to students to check for LDs. In the second
stage, students who scored a GlearnAQ >80 then sat for the
--T- test. According to DTLA-4 and --T- Level II,
students who were considered to be at risk for LDs met two
criteria: (a) an uneven DTLA-4 linguistic profile with a SD
±3 between the higher nonverbal and lower verbal compos-
ites, and (b) a SD ±15 between the higher GlearnAQ and the
lower general language acquisition quotient (GLAQ;
Tzouriadou, Anagnostopoulou, et al., 2008; Tzouriadou,
Sigkollitou, et al., 2008).
Statistical Analysis
Mann­Whitney tests, after a significant omnibus Kruskal­
Wallis test, were used to explore differences between Greek
and Greek FSU-Pontian students at risk for LDs and Greek
and Greek FSU-Pontian typically developed students on the
GLAQ, the scores in language acquisition composites and
modalities, the general language achievement (GLA) scores,
and the language achievement domain scores.
Spearman's rho correlation coefficients were used to evalu-
ate the associations between GLAQ and the GLA in the study
sample. To explore graphically the abovementioned associa-
tions, the Loess curve, the optimally fitted curve that best
describes the relationship between the examined variables,
was plotted on the corresponding scatterplots (Jacoby, 2000).
The observed significance level (p value) in all statistical
hypothesis testing procedures was estimated by the Monte
Carlo simulation method. This method leads to valid inferen-
tial conclusions, even in cases where the methodological pre-
suppositions (random sampling, independent observations,
symmetrical distributions and absence of outliers) of the
nonparametric tests are not satisfied (Mehta & Patel, 1996).
Results
According to DTLA-4 and --T- Level II, 56 students out
of the 158 students in the study sample were considered at
risk for LDs. Of these, 25 were Greeks and 31 were Greek
FSU-Pontian. The remaining 102 students were considered
typically developed without an uneven DTLA-4 linguistic
profile (nonverbal­verbal) or differences between general
learning acquisition quotient and GLAQ. Of these, 49 were
Greeks and 31 were Greek FSU-Pontian (see Table 2). This
finding highlights the increased danger of CLD and low-SES
students' disproportionate representation in LDs (Artiles &
Trent, 2000; Hibel et al., 2010; Limpos & Geva, 2001) and
supports the view that the use of the achievement criterion
alone is inadequate for identifying a student at risk for LDs
(Fletcher et al., 2005; Giovingo et al., 2005).
Statistically significant differences were detected between
Greek students at risk for LDs (GLD) and Pontian Greek stu-
dents from the former Soviet Union at risk for LDs (Greek
FSU-Pontian LD) in GLAQ (p < .015), in reception language
composite (p < .002), in organization language composite (p <
.046), and in morphological language modality (p < .008), the
GLD group of students scoring more highly than the others
(see Table 3). This finding can be attributed to CLD students'
bilingualism. These students lack a deep understanding of the
Greek language as compared with their Greek classmates of
similar SES and educational opportunities. This deficit can be
seen particularly in the differences found in the morphological
language modality, which is associated with deep language
structure (Chomsky, 1965). These differences may imply that

CLD students may have difficulties in acquiring the second
language because the use of their first native language reduces
their use of the second (Genesee et al., 2005).
Statistically significant differences were detected between
GLD students and Greek FSU-PontianLD students in GLA
(p < .051), in grammar (p < .019), in syntax (p < .018), and in
vocabulary (p < .034), the GLD group of students scoring
more highly than the others (see Table 4).This finding con-
firms other research findings indicating CLD students' lower
school language achievement as compared with native speak-
ers (Artiles & Trent, 2000; Coutinho et al., 2002). Also, CLD
students' low vocabulary achievement is a strong indicator
for their low language achievement (Genesee et al., 2005).
Statistically significant differences were detected between
typically developed Greek students (GTD) and typically
developed Pontian Greek students from the former Soviet
Union (Greek FSU-PontianTD) in GLAQ (p < .001), in
reception (p < .001), in organization (p < .004), in expression
(p < .001), in conceptual (p < .008), and in morphological
(another term used to describe students with a specific LD
<.001), the GTD group of students scoring more highly than
the others (see Table 5). This finding is consistent with other
research findings indicating that CLD students'low language
competence is often confused with their cognitive and learn-
ing abilities (Artiles, Rueda, Salazar, & Higareda, 2005;
Capps et al., 2005; Kessidou, 2008).
Statistically significant differences were detected between
GTD students and Greek FSU-PontianTD students in GLA
(p < .004), in reading comprehension (p < .027), and in syntax
(p < .012), the GTD group of students again scoring more
highly than the others (see Table 6). This finding is in accor-
dance with other research findings suggesting that CLD stu-
dents' reading comprehension skills may be reduced owing to
their small vocabulary, their limited opportunities for interac-
tions with their peers among native speakers peers, and the use

of the second language at home, all of which are associated
with slowed literacy development (Genesee et al., 2005; Hoff,
2013; Leze, 2000; Michalopoulou & Schaefer, 2015).
A strong and positive statistically significant correlation
was detected (r = .639, p = .000) between GLAQ and GLA in
all study sample students (see Figure 1). It seems that lan-
guage acquisition competence is associated with language
achievement. Other research evidence supports this finding
(Samson & Lesaux, 2009; Wilkinson et al., 2006). In Greece,
there is no other psychometric test that measures language
acquisition competence, and --T- test may be used to
predict school language achievement.
Discussion
Teachers'judgments on CLD and low-SES students at risk for
LDs based on the school achievement criterion were not
accurate. School achievement is considered a social construct
mainly concerning native-speaking, middle-class students
(Peske & Haycock, 2006). School achievement is also based
on teachers'subjective perceptions and knowledge, which are
shaped by their teaching experience. For these reasons, and
bearing in mind that in Greece there are no standardized
achievement tests in use, it came as no surprise that the
research sample included students at risk for intellectual dis-
abilities. Moreover, as has already been mentioned, a LD
diagnosis is based on judgments made by professionals,
which often, but not exclusively, follow measurements
(Waber, 2010).
To reduce the possibility of inconsistent and inaccurate
judgments on LDs, given the unknown nature of its causes,
researchers could use samples of participants with similar
characteristics. This research study sample consisted entirely
of students from low-SES areas who attended underprivi-
leged schools with low educational opportunities. One group
was bilingual and diglossic (Greek FSU-Pontian).
Convenience sampling was used, in which students were
selected to participate from available areas and populations.
Because of the small sample size, it is unclear whether the
results can be generalized to the wider population. Still, this
study can be considered for future research. The fact that all
study sample students came from the same population may
explain why both native and minority students had similar
language and achievement profiles and why language com-
petence and achievement differences between them could be
assumed to be due to CLD students' bilingualism. The stan-
dardized Language Acquisition Competence Test (Lato)
used in this research proved that it can be a prediction tool
for language achievement, as strong and positive correlations
were found between this test and the informal language
achievement test.
Another research finding was that both native speakers
and CLD students were identified as being at risk for LDs,
with similar learning and language competence profiles.
Nowadays, LD is best understood as a function of the devel-
opmental interaction between the child's inherent difficulties,
whose causes are still unknown, and environmental factors
(Waber, 2010). LD appears in the early developmental stages,
with indications mostly found in language development,
which comprises the basis of general learning competence.
Special education legislation in Greece has aimed to reduce
prejudices toward CLD students and, as already mentioned,
thus excludes these students from being classified as learning
disabled. In a recent Greek study, it was found that in-service
schoolteachers believe that dyslexia--another term used to
describe students with a specific LD--is not related to CLD
students, whereas university students, who have more up-to-
date theoretical knowledge, believe that CLD students can
have dyslexia (Tzouriadou et al., in press).
Conclusion
Taking all these factors into account, it is impossible to state
with certainty whether CLD students in Greece are dispro-
portionately represented among students with LDs. This is a
hindrance to tackling prejudice and victimization, because
no suitable teaching practices are provided for CLD students
in need. The remedial Greek language instruction applied
with some groups of CLD students is not based on any evalu-
ation of their needs, and it appears that second-generation
CLD students (Greek FSU-Pontians) are underachievers at
school (Kessidou, 2008). CLD students' integration from
intercultural schools and classes into general Greek educa-
tion was not based on evaluation of their language skills but
was intended primarily to reduce prejudices toward cultural
and language diversity. Further research is needed in larger
samples of various CLD student populations in Greece to test
the possibility that CLD students may have LDs, but not only
on the basis of the achievement criterion. Accordingly, CLD
students' evaluation for disability should focus on assessing
their language acquisition. Furthermore, CLD students' edu-
cation should concentrate on language subjects, being taught
with special teaching methods.
