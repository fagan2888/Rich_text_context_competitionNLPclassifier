Abstract
Cancer survivors experience treatment-related complications that can be exacerbated by tobacco use. This
study reports the prevalence of smokeless and dual tobacco use, compares these rates to the U.S. population,
and examines tobacco risk factors among males surviving childhood cancer. Data from the Childhood Cancer
Survivor Study (CCSS) 2007 survey were used (N ¼ 3378). Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were obtained by
comparing CCSS data with the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression was used to
evaluate associations between risk factors and tobacco use. Among male survivors, 8.3% and 2.3% were current
smokeless tobacco and dual tobacco users, respectively. Survivors were less likely than population males to
report smokeless tobacco [SIR ¼ 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57­0.72) or dual tobacco (SIR ¼ 0.37; CI,
0.29­0.46) use; however, non-White survivors aged 35 to 49 years were more likely to use smokeless tobacco
(SIR ¼ 2.32; CI, 1.27­3.90). Smokeless tobacco use was associated (P < 0.05) with younger age at diagnosis, lower
education, being married or divorced/separated, and not living in the Northeastern United State, whereas
history of cardiovascular- and/or pulmonary-toxic treatment was protective. Dual tobacco use was associated
with younger age at diagnosis, lower education, divorce/separation, and high psychologic distress. Having
active heart or circulatory conditions was protective. Although smokeless tobacco/dual tobacco use is
generally low among childhood cancer survivors, these findings suggest that tobacco use screening should
be expanded to include smokeless tobacco use, and that smokeless tobacco-specific education and cessation
interventions should be provided to users. Screening and intervening for smokeless tobacco/dual tobacco use
in childhood cancer survivors will reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers

Introduction
Over the past 50 years, survival rates for childhood
cancer have dramatically improved with 1 in 640 U.S.
young adults now estimated to be survivors (1, 2). Sur-
vivorship is commonly affected by complications result-
ing from cancer treatment. Specifically, 42% of pediatric
cancer survivors experience serious, disabling, or life-
threatening illnesses by 30 years after diagnosis (3). These
include cardiovascular disease, stroke, kidney failure,
pulmonary fibrosis, and second malignancies, conditions
that may be the result of, or exacerbated by, tobacco use.
Antineoplastic therapies used in cancer treatments result
in cardiopulmonary toxicities and organ compromise,
which may be further potentiated by tobacco use. Patients
who continue tobacco use after diagnosis are at increased
risk for both acute (e.g., treatment complications) and
long-term health risks (e.g., disease recurrence, secondary
primary cancer, and reduced survival) relative to those
who quit (4, 5). As such, survivors of childhood cancer
should avoid tobacco to decrease their risk for long-term
health problems.
Although smoking has been examined among pediatric
cancer survivors, smokeless tobacco and dual tobacco use
(e.g., usage of both combustible and smokeless tobacco)
has not (4, 6). The 2 most commonly used smokeless
tobacco products in the United States are snuff and chew-
ing tobacco, and both are absorbed through tissue in the
mouth (7). Smokeless tobacco includes up to 28 carcino-
gens and is associated with malignancies of the mouth,
tongue, throat, esophagus, stomach, and pancreas and
increased risk of cardiovascular disease, myocardial
infarctions, and stroke (7, 8). As survivors are already
susceptible to these late effects, tobacco use would be

expected to not only add to this risk but also potentiate
synergistic effects, thus increasing risk for chronic health
conditions (3, 9).
The current study was conducted to determine the
prevalence of smokeless tobacco and dual tobacco use
among adult survivors of childhood cancer, and to iden-
tify risk factors associated with tobacco behaviors.
Materials and Methods
The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is a
multi-institutional study of individuals who have sur-
vived 5 years or more after diagnosis of childhood cancer.
Diagnoses represented in this cohort include leukemia,
brain tumor, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lympho-
ma, Wilm's tumor, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma,
and bone tumors. Participants were diagnosed before 21
years of age and treated at one of the 26 collaborating
institutions between January 1, 1970 and December 31,
1986. A detailed description of the CCSS study is reported
elsewhere (10, 11). The study was approved by the Insti-
tutional review board at each institution, and informed
consent was obtained from participants.
Of the 10,143 survivors eligible for the 2007 follow-up
survey, 374 (3.7%) were lost to follow-up. Among parti-
cipants successfully contacted, 82.0% (n ¼ 8,013) complet-
ed the study questionnaire. Participants and those lost to
follow-up were similar in regard to diagnosis and geo-
graphic region; however, study participants were more
likely to be White and of older age at diagnosis (P < 0.05).
Women were excluded because of low engagement in
smokeless tobacco (n ¼ 6) and dual tobacco (n ¼ 1) use.
The remaining sample of 4,000 males was further restrict-
ed to those living in the United States (n ¼ 3,717) and those
with complete tobacco data (n ¼ 3,378). Canadian parti-
cipants were excluded because the reference population
used to calculate standardized incidence was U.S. based.
Study outcomes were based on participants' self-report of
smokeless and combustible tobacco use. Participants who
did/did not complete the tobacco items were similar in
regard to cancer type, race, age at diagnosis, income,
geographic region, educational status, and marital status
(P > 0.05).
Primary outcomes
Smokeless tobacco use. Participants who endorsed
response options of "occasionally use" or "regularly use"
for chewing and/or snuff tobacco over the last year were
classified as smokeless tobacco users.
Dual tobacco use. Participants were classified as
"dual users" if engaged in smokeless tobacco use as
defined above, and responded "yes" to current cigarette
use or "occasionally use" or "regularly use" of cigars or
pipes.
Independent variables
Demographic/personal variables considered included
age at and years since diagnosis, race, educational attain-
ment, household income, marital status, geographic
region of residence, and current age. Health condition
variables included cancer diagnosis, history of relapse/
second malignant neoplasms (SMN), and respiratory and
heart/circulatory health status. Respiratory health status
was based on 8 items querying history of breathing/lung
problems (asthma, emphysema, lung fibrosis, etc.,).
Heart/circulatory health was based on 13 items querying
history of cardiovascular problems (myocardial infarc-
tion, arrhythmia, hypertension, etc.). For each system-
specific condition, participants reported condition history
based on the following response options: (i) "yes, condi-
tion still present," (ii) "yes, condition not present," (iii) "no
history of condition," and (iv) "not sure." Participants were
grouped into disease acuity categories based on endorse-
ment of the condition at the highest level. Psychologic
distress was based upon the Brief Symptom Inventory-
1812 (depression, somatization, anxiety, and Global Sever-
ity Index; GSI) applying a clinical cut-off score  63 (90th
percentile; ref. 12) and antidepressant use. Participants'
level of physical activity was based upon reported par-
ticipation over the previous month.
Cancer treatments known to be associated with cardio-
vascular and/or pulmonary complications including che-
motherapy (bleomycin, BCNU/CCNU, anthracyclines)
and radiation therapy (cranial irradiation associated with
increased risk of metabolic syndrome, chest irradiation
involving the heart and/or lungs, and/or neck irradiation
involving the carotid arteries) were also examined.
Dichotomous (yes/no) variables were created to charac-
terize exposure to any of the 3 chemotherapies (at-risk
chemotherapy) or 3 exposure areas of radiation therapy
(at-risk radiation therapy), as well as an overall dichoto-
mous variable for exposure to any of the 6 treatment
variables (at-risk cancer treatment).
Statistical analysis
Currentrates of smokeless tobacco anddual tobacco use
for the CCSS cohort were compared with data from the
2007 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (13). Using
expected values standardized by age, sex, and White/
non-White race, prevalence ratios (PR; PR ¼ observed/
expected) were computed along with corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Probability values were estimat-
ed using Byar approximation. The associations between
risk factors and tobacco outcomes were evaluated in
generalized linear models using PROC LOGISTIC in SAS
version 9.2. Univariate models were first conducted to test
associations between single-risk factors and tobacco out-
comes. Independent variables with initial P values < 0.15
were included in multivariable models. Final multivariate
models were determined using a backward selection
process based on minimum Akaike's information criteri-
on (AIC). If there were variables that were not significant
at the 5% level of significance, but were included in the
model chosen by AIC, then the model was rerun without
those variables. If the AIC for the new model didn't
increase significantly, then the reduced model was

Results
At the time of data collection, the mean population age
was 36.4 years (SD 7.5; range, 21.0­58.0). The majority of
participants (86.5%) were self-identified as White, 55.9%
were married, 65.5% had Bachelor degrees or more, and
48.1% reported annual household income $60,000 or
more. Distribution of diagnoses is as follows: leukemia
(33.1%), central nervous system tumor (11.9%), Hodgkin
lymphoma (13.7%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (10.8%),
Wilm's tumor (7.9%), neuroblastoma (5.6%), soft-tissue
sarcoma (9.2%), and bone tumors (8.1%). Almost 61%
were diagnosed between ages 0 to 9 and 25.3% experi-
enced relapse. Participants received the following cardio-
vascular- and/or pulmonary-toxic therapies: bleomycin
(6.0%), BCNU/CCNU (7.0%), anthracyclines (37.2%),
chest irradiation (17.5%), neck irradiation (16.4%). Over-
all, 40.4% of the sample received at-risk chemotherapy,
46.5% received at-risk radiation therapy, and 65.8%
received at-risk cancer treatment. More than 32% of par-
ticipants reported a current heart/circulatory condition
(6.4% reported past history), and 11.9% reported a current
respiratory condition (8.5% reported past history).
Approximately 5% experienced clinically significant glob-
al psychologic distress, or disordered somatization (5.5%),
depression (8.0%), or anxiety (5.1%). Nearly 12% were
taking antidepressants, and 77.7% reported engaging in
physical activity.
Of the 3,378 participants, 279 (8.3%) reported current
use of smokeless tobacco and 79 (2.3%) reported dual
tobacco use. Comparisons of age- and race-standardized
prevalence rates of tobacco use between survivors and the
general population revealed that smokeless tobacco use
(PR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57­0.72) was significantly lower
among survivors (Table 1). Dual tobacco use (PR, 0.37;
95% CI, 0.29­0.46) was also significantly lower in survi-
vors. Significant PRs 1.0 or more were found only for
smokeless tobacco use in non-White survivors aged 35 to
49 years (P ¼ 0.008).
Univariate analyses identified associations between
smokeless tobacco use and age at diagnosis, race, educa-
tion, household income, marital status, U.S. region of
residence, cancer diagnosis, psychologic distress (anxiety,
somatization, and GSI), antidepressant use, and exposure
to various cancer treatments. In multivariable models, at-
risk cancer treatment and GSI were used to represent
treatment and psychologic distress to reduce potential
collinearity between constructs. In the final multivariable
logistic model, factors that remained independently asso-
ciated with smokeless tobacco use included early age at
cancer diagnosis, not being a college graduate, being
married or divorced/separated, and not residing in the
Northeast (Table 2). Decreased risk of smokeless tobacco
use was associated with having received at-risk cancer
treatment.
Univariate analyses assessing dual tobacco use identi-
fied associations between age at diagnosis, current age,
education, household income, marital status, U.S. region
of residence, heart/circulatory problem, physical activity,
psychologic distress (anxiety, somatization, and GSI),
antidepressant use, bleomycin exposure, anthracycline
exposure, at-risk chemotherapy, and at-risk cancer treat-
ment. The final multivariable logistic model identified
dual tobacco use to be independently associated with
younger age at cancer diagnosis, not being a college
graduate, being separated/divorced, and being psycho-
logically distressed (Table 3). Existing heart and/or
circulatory problems were associated with a decreased
likelihood of dual tobacco use.
Discussion
Males surviving childhood cancer engage in smokeless
tobacco and dual tobacco use, but their rates are lower
than the U.S. population. Sex, education, U.S. region of

residence, psychologic functioning, age at diagnosis, and
marital status were identified as risk factors for tobacco
use, whereas active heart/circulatory conditions and at-
risk cancer treatment were protective. Despite their vul-
nerable health status, these results suggest that surviving
childhood cancer does not make one immune to tobacco
use. As such, careful screening and the provision of risk-
based care should be prioritized among all adults as
recommended by the Public Health Service clinical guide-
lines (14). This is particularly important for survivors of
childhood cancer, as suboptimal application of the guide-
lines has been reported in this group (15). As 90% of
survivors experience medical encounters at least biannu-
ally (16), screening may be conducted more often by
health professionals, thus maximizing the opportunity
for tobacco surveillance and intervention.
Although White survivors reported lower rates of
smokelesstobaccowhencomparedwiththegeneralpopu-
lation, non-White survivors had comparable or increased
rates. Specifically, 6.1% of middle-aged non-White sur-
vivors (and 2.6% of their population peers) reported
smokeless tobacco use. These findings are concerning as
survivors are at increased health risk secondary to treat-
ment, and are less likely to quit tobacco use in general (17).
Furthermore, ethnic minorities are at disproportionally
high risk of cerebral vascular disease and mortality sec-
ondary to diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular
disease (14). Therefore, ethnic minority status compounds
the risk of smokeless tobacco use for this group of non-
White survivors (14, 18). However, this finding should
be interpreted within the confines of limited cell sizes
among subgroups, which limit the generalizability of this
finding.
Several risk factors were identified for both smokeless
tobacco and dual tobacco use including younger age at
diagnosis, lower education, and being divorced/separat-
ed. Unique predictors of smokeless tobacco included
being married and not living in the Northeast, whereas
a history of at-risk cancer treatment was protective against
smokeless tobacco. Dual tobacco was independently asso-
ciated with high psychologic distress, a factor, which
associates with both smoking and difficulty quitting
(19, 20). Finally, having an active heart/circulatory con-
dition was protective against dual tobacco, which is nota-
ble considering the cardiovascular risk associated with
both smokeless tobacco and combustible tobacco use
(21). Similar risk (lower education, psychologic distress)
and protective factors (at-risk treatment) have been pre-
viously shown for smoking in childhood cancer survivors
(6, 22, 23).
These results may be limited by potential under-report-
ing of tobacco use given this population's susceptibility

to tobacco-related complication, and stigma associated
with tobacco use (24). Future designs should consider
strategies that will increase the validity of tobacco use
outcomes such as biochemical verification or bogus pipe-
line (25). Also, this study did not consider contemporary
forms of tobacco use (hookah, narghile, bidis, kreteks, e-
cigarettes).
Over the past 50 years, survival rates for childhood
cancer have increased exponentially (1, 2). As such, a
longer continuum of care has been necessitated, which
focuses on the reduction of risk for second cancers and
adverse late effects. Interventions to eliminate or reduce
cancer-linked behaviors (including smokeless tobacco
and dual tobacco use) are now fundamental components
of survivorship care. The promotion of healthy behaviors
will not only reduce morbidity/mortality in this popula-
tion, but also translate to better quality of life outcomes.
