Abstract: How has human information behavior evolved? Our paper explores this question
in the form of notions, models and theories about the relationship between information
behavior and human evolution. Alexander's Ecological Dominance and Social
Competition/Cooperation (EDSC) model currently provides the most comprehensive
overview of human traits in the development of a theory of human evolution and sociality.
His model provides a basis for explaining the evolution of human socio-cognitive abilities,
including ecological dominance, and social competition/cooperation. Our paper examines
the human trait of information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability related to ecological
dominance, and social competition/cooperation. The paper first outlines what is meant by
information behavior from various interdisciplinary perspectives. We propose that
information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability that is related to and enables other socio-
cognitive abilities such as human ecological dominance, and social
competition/cooperation. The paper reviews the current state of evolutionary approaches to
information behavior and future directions for this research

Introduction
"Humans had in some unique fashion become so ecologically dominant that they in
effect became their own principal hostile force of nature, explicitly in regard to
evolutionary changes in human psyche and social behavior" (Alexander, 1990b, p. 4).
For more than twenty years, many leading social scientists have been exploring the
questions: How has evolution shaped human cognition and behavior? (Barkow, Cosmides
and Tooby, 1992; Buss, 1995, 2003; Cosmides and Tooby, 1997; Flinn, 2004; Mithen,
1996; Plotkin, 1998; Stevens and Price, 1996; Tooby and Cosmides, 1989). What general
selective forces drove the evolution of hominids? (Alexander, 1990a,b, 2005, 2006) and
What combination of selective forces caused the appearance of the various unique and

distinctive features of humans and their social life? (Alexander, 1990b; Baumeister, 2005).
Many social science subjects are developing their fields of inquiry within such an
evolutionary framework, including evolutionary biology, evolutionary ecology,
evolutionary psychiatry, evolutionary psychology and cognitive archeology. In this paper
we ask: How has human information behavior evolved? We also explore the relationship
between information behavior, as a socio-cognitive ability, and human evolution.
Alexander's Ecological Dominance and Social Competition (EDSC) model
currently provides the most comprehensive overview of human traits in the development of
a theory of human evolution, sociality and socio-cognitive abilities (Alexander, 1971, 1979,
1987, 1990a, b; Alexander and Tinkle, 1981; Finn, Geary and Ward, 2005; Geary, 2005;
Irons, 2005). Alexander's model provides a basis for explaining the evolution of human
cognitive abilities as it centers on the ecological dominance of humans in nature and their
competence in social competition. Humans have become ecologically dominant via
increased inter and intra group competition and cooperation, and have developed various
socio-cognitive abilities (Alexander, 1987). Irons (2005) and Flinn, Geary and Ward (2005)
provide an extensive overview of the strengths and weaknesses of Alexander's Model for
fields such as evolutionary psychology and anthropology, and highlight the validity of
Alexander's Model with support from the human fossil record and findings from studies of
the human brain and mind.
In this paper we briefly outline two views of human evolution, and then describe
what is meant by a human socio-cognitive ability which is a uniquely human attribute
(Alexander, 1990b). We then propose that information behavior is an important socio-
cognitive ability and describe what is meant by the term information behavior from the
perspective of information science, information theory/processing, evolutionary
psychology and the emerging information behavior perspective. The paper then discusses
how information behavior is emerging as an important human socio-cognitive ability from
an interdisciplinary perspective. Such reviews are a useful way of understanding the
interdisciplinary relations between fields incorporating evolutionary perspectives (Krill,
Platek, Goetz and Shackelford, 2007).
Human Evolution: Two Views
Information behavior is a uniquely human attribute that differentiates humans from
other mammals due to unique attributes of the human brain. Somewhere along the
evolutionary line the human brain diverged from that of other mammals. There are various
theories as to why this is so. One theory is that there is qualitative difference between the
human brain as it is now and what it was in pre-human form. Spink and Cole (2006) refer
to what is termed a great leap-type neurological transformation in the human brain (Ehrlich,
2000; Klein, 2000), which may have produced a dramatic transformation in human
cognitive architecture (Mithen, 1988, 1996) and enhanced working memory (Wynn and
Coolidge, 2004). This occurred from 40,000 to 75,000 years ago. According to Mithen
(1996), this dramatic transformation allowed Homo sapiens to survive while Neanderthals
did not. Human hunter-gatherers became dramatically more efficient in exploiting their
environment, more able to cope with environmental extremes, and more flexible in social
behavior (Mithen, 1988). Mithen's Great Leap forward theory is a radical form of the
theory of punctuated equilibria which holds that evolutionary transformations took place in
sudden, radical steps (Gould and Eldredge, 1977).

The opposite view of human brain evolution argues that the difference between the
present day human brain and that of our mammal and primate ancestors can be explained
by increased brain size alone. There has been a sevenfold increase in brain size relative to
body mass from ape to present day human (Jerison, 1973). Often called "the strong form of
the encephalization hypothesis" or the unitary hypothesis (Donald, 1991, p. 106).
According to this hypothesis, there was one evolutionary adaptation only in human
evolution, that of brain size, with the gradual increase in size
In the Ecological Dominance and Social Competition / Cooperation (EDSC) model,
Alexander (1990b) states that: "During these several million years the hominid line
diverged far from that of the apes, especially in regard to brain size and function, and
accompanying complexities of behavior, particularly social behavior" (p. 3). The increased
brain size could have been due to a specific human behavior, with the increasing but
gradual need for human cooperation among groups to survive in an environment where
competition was not so much from the environment itself but from competition from other
groups. To compete and cooperate effectively, the human developed new types of behavior
which in turn caused adaptations in the brain and other human physiology related to
communication such as the larynx.
Alexander (1990b) asks what sort of challenges could have caused the human
divergence to accelerate in its later stages. He concludes that the divergence may have been
due to the development of human socio-cognitive abilities. Alexander (1990b) defines
socio-cognitive ability as an attribute or trait that is unique and unusual to humans. These
socio-cognitive abilities, according to Alexander (1990b) led to human evolutionary
physical adaptations such as menopause, concealment of ovulation and altriciality.
These socio-cognitive abilities emerged and developed as humans evolved,
allowing further selective human advantages due to these cognitive changes. Alexander
(1990b) frames socio-cognitive abilities and human intelligence as a social tool and "the
human brain has evolved in the context of social cooperation and competition" (p. 4).
Physical changes to the hominid form were caused by the brain as a social tool to increase
intra-group cooperation in competition with other groups. Hidden ovulation, hairlessness,
and menopause--usually such radical adaptations occur elsewhere in animal world when
animal entered new habitat (e.g., land to sea). But in humans it is Alexander's and other's
view that these changes were due to social condition--brain as social tool--changing
physical attributes. As another example, Lovejoy (1980) argues that even the advent in
humans of bipedalism (standing erect), which involved huge risks (abandoning the safety
of the trees, etc.) emerged in humans because of social stability or cooperation among
humans (pair-bonding, shared infant care etc.).
It is precisely Alexander's focus on the role he accords to society, competition and
social cooperation in the development of human socio-cognitive abilities that we emphasize
in this paper to balance the cognitive perspective of Mithen as we described in Spink and
Cole (2006).
What we specifically set out to do here is to explore the notion that information
behavior is a socio-cognitive ability which developed as a result of both cognitive and
social factors during human evolution. We highlight information behavior and the
evolution of human cognition in terms of information behavior and information.
This paper next discusses socio-cognitive ability, and then outlines what is
information behavior from various interdisciplinary perspectives. We then discuss how
information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability that is related to and enables other socio-

cognitive abilities, i.e., human ecological dominance, and social competition and
cooperation.
Socio-Cognitive Ability
In human evolution from primate to Homo sapiens, no intermediate line of species
survived, which is unique in evolution. The hostile forces of the environment could not
alone represent a challenge great enough to have caused the human-ape brain divergence
(Alexander, 1990a,b). One view is that our human ancestors were in competition with other
forms of hominoid (e.g., the Neanderthals), and the human brain transformed as Homo
sapiens developed socio-cognitive abilities and cooperated together to successfully
compete against the Neanderthals. However, even when the Neanderthals died out the
human brain continued to increase in size and functionality; in fact, the increase in size and
functionality quickened. The more recent development of the human brain was caused by
the human need to cooperate within groups to compete against other groups of Homo
sapiens. The "cooperation-to-compete" hypothesis is that only humans among and between
themselves could have developed a sufficiently large challenge to force the human
adaptation process; that humans themselves became their own hostile force of nature.
The problems that have driven the evolution of human cognitive abilities are not
problems due to the physical environment but primarily social problems. Humphrey (1976)
describes his hypothesis of the evolution of the brain as a social tool; the human race
selected for individuals who were good at social manipulation (Alexander, 1990b). Dunbar
(1993) proposes that language developed out of the need for maintain social organizations.
Even mathematics, which is a sort of linguistic ability, is created and used to advance the
social concerns of the group in competition with other, hostile groups.
To understand the evolution of our understanding of information behavior as a
socio-cognitive ability, we first discuss how the concept of information is evolving.
Information and information processing
Information
Information has been defined in various ways (Case, 2002; Cole, 1994). Buckland
(1991) influentially divided the definitions into three types: information-as-thing,
information-as-knowledge and information-as-process. Information-as-thing is probably
the common conception of information--i.e., that information is additive and does not
create a qualitative difference in the way the person receiving the information thinks.
However, the information-as-process definition has gained favor in information science due
in part to Brookes' (1980) influential fundamental equation which states that information
modifies the knowledge structure of the person receiving the information. According to
Brookes, knowledge structures provide a mechanism that subjectively interprets sense data
in the environment, transforming this data into information. The information-as-process
definition is useful because it provides a framework for how the transformation of sense
data into information occurs.
The next section discusses how the cognitive sciences perceive information as
process and explore information processing.

Information processing perspective in cognitive psychology
Information processing relates to the working of humans' cognitive architecture,
information behavior models the behavioral manifestations of the information processing
cognitive architecture (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968). The field of cognitive psychology
investigates internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, language and
information processing within the context of understanding human thinking. The dominant
theory in cognitive psychology dealing with information is information processing theory
(Newell, 1990). The theory concerns how the human cognitive system deals with
information, how and why did it evolve with its particular characteristics.
The information processing view within cognitive psychology provides a useful
framework for how humans are able to cognitively transform sense data from their physical
and social environment into information that enables adaptive processes to occur. The
dominant theory in cognitive psychology dealing with information is information
processing theory. Information processing theory describes information flow from
environmental inputs entering the human information processing system to memory
outputs. These memory outputs can take many forms. Here we narrow the discussion to the
process of how information structures are retrieved from long-term memory (LTM) in
reaction to an environmental stimulus. These information structures enable the decoding-
type processing of the environmental stimulus, control how that stimulus is processed, and
finally how the new stimulus is encoded in LTM.
There are complicated, structure-oriented models of cognitive architecture
(Anderson and Lebiere, 1998; Anderson, Taatgen and Byrne, 2005; Baddeley, Chincotta
and Adlam, 2001; Miyake and Shah, 1999). However, for the present purposes, a well-
known model of cognitive architecture that describes the basic processes involved in
human information processing is provided by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968). Here,
environmental input is first registered in a sensory store then shifted to a buffer or memory
structure called the short-term memory store (STS). "This store may be regarded as the
subject's working memory" (Atkinson and Shiffrin, 1968, p. 12). In Atkinson and Shiffrin,
the STS can be in a separate physiological structure from LTS or simply "a temporary
activation of information permanently stored in the long-term store" (Shiffrin and
Atkinson, 1969, p. 180). In the STS, the input is either not attended to, leading to eventual
decay or attended to and manipulated when appropriate stored information is retrieved from
the long-term memory store (LTS).
Information structures are retrieved from the LTS via a self-addressing memory,
which can be compared to a library shelving system. In a library shelving system, books are
given a call number via a classification scheme which indicates both the book's storage
position and the user's retrieval position on the shelf. In the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, to
facilitate matching the storage and retrieval system likewise "mirror" each other (Shiffrin
and Atkinson, 1969).
Pertinent to our article is a new environmental stimulus waiting processing in STS
is matched to information structures in LTS via attributes or characteristics of the stimulus.
A stimulus that is less familiar to the person takes longer to match than more familiar
stimuli. Environmental stimuli causing humans to adapt to changing social and physical
environmental conditions and their survival in that new environment are by definition
unfamiliar to the human. Unfamiliar stimuli would have to be processed in some way,
despite a lack of match, probably according to the "least effort" principle. This favors our
thesis that the matching mechanism between an unfamiliar environmental input and the
Information behavior: a socio-cognitive ability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -262-
LTS is set-up to select and retrieve social-themed information when processing new and
unfamiliar environmental stimuli. A sort of default setting which through repeated selection
would become reinforced over time--thus reinforcing the "social" vector of evolutionary
selection and adaptation.
In other words, the default setting for dealing with unfamiliar stimuli input from the
environment means that the selection, adaptation and expansion of those same information
structures over the course of evolution will continue to be in the direction of ever more
sophisticated "social-themed" information structures stored in the LTS.
Human information processing and the Atkinson-Shiffrin (1968) model of cognitive
architecture that determine cognitive information flow also determine information
behavior. Unresolved data and anomalies in the environment that enter the STS signal
changes in the human social and physical environment that may lead to thinking, problem
solving and learning activities that provoke information behavior. Information behavior
plays the fundamental role of giving humans the ability to perceive changes in their
physical and social environment through the perception of sense data, then cognitively
transform this sense data into information, so that they can adapt to these changes. We have
defined this ability here as a human socio-cognitive ability.
Scholars from the information theory/processing perspective also discuss the role of
information in human cultural evolution, and the relationship between human information
processing and evolutionary theory. Stonier (1997) provides a theory of how the brain
works from an information systems perspective. Avery (2003) relates evolution and
information theory via the second law of thermodynamics. Harms and Ruse (2004) create
the conceptual foundations for a science and theory of knowledge through the application
of evolutionary theory. Yockey (2005) discusses the use of information theory and coding
theory in molecular biology.
Overall, the information processing approach focuses on how the mind functions;
for example, how the left and right sides of the brain communicate or how fast neurons fire
(Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby, 1992). This paper extends on the information processing
approach to include consideration of information behavior. The next section of the paper
describes what is meant by information behavior from the perspective of various scientific
fields, including information science (non-evolutionary) evolutionary psychology and
evolutionary information behavior.
Information behavior
Information science perspective
The field of information science includes the research area that studies human
information related behaviors, including information seeking, information foraging,
information retrieving, information organizing and information uses (Spink and Cole, 2005,
2006). The information behavior perspective assumes that information is a cognitive
construction by humans during their behavior within social, cultural and organizational
environments (Spink and Cole, 2005). More specifically focused than information
behavior, Spink and Cole (2005) define information seeking as a sub-set of information
behavior that includes the purposive seeking of information in relation to a goal;
information organizing behavior is the process of analyzing and classifying materials into
defined categories (which we extended to include human cognitive information organizing
Information behavior: a socio-cognitive ability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -263-
behavior in Cole and Leide, 2006); and information use behavior involves incorporating
information into an individual's existing knowledge base.
Research into information behavior in information science has largely built
contemporary non-evolutionary models incorporating concepts related to contemporary
information behaviors (Case, 2002; Spink and Cole, 2005, 2006). Other fields, such as
social psychology, marketing and consumer buying, have also study contemporary
information behavior (Case, 2002. Information science has largely adopted a focus based
on solving the technological, psychological and social problems of the post-WWII
information explosion and fulfilling Vannevar Bush's vision of the Memex machine (Bush,
1945; Saracevic, 1999), which foresaw the development of computers and techniques that
would allow the more effective organization and retrieval of information (Saracevic, 1999).
Yet information behavior is a basic human behavior that has aided us in our survival
from the beginning of human existence (Spink and Cole, 2005, 2006). Information science
has recently begun to be influenced by Evolutionary Psychology and exploring the central
role of information (Bates, 2005) and information behavior (Spink and Cole, 2006) as a
mechanism of human adaptation and survival. Like the human behaviors surrounding food
production, information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability facilitating adaptation and
survival.
The next section of the paper outlines the current Evolutionary Psychology
perspectives regarding information behavior.
Evolutionary psychology perspective
The evolutionary psychology approach to information behavior has focused on the
behavioral aspects of humans and information behavior. Evolutionary psychologists and
related researchers have written about information behaviors in an evolutionary sense. The
history of information behaviors within evolutionary psychology is seen as related to the
evolution of human behavior (Eibi-Eibesfeldt and Strachen, 1996).
The objective of evolutionary psychology is to explore functioning and
development of the human mind from a human evolutionary theoretical perspective,
including information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability (Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby,
1992; Mithen, 1988, 1996). Cognitive archeologist Mithen (1996) studied Upper
Paleolithic cultures, focusing on prehistoric cave art and the meaning that can be derived
from what he and other researchers interpret as a method and mechanism for information
storage. Mithen (1996) advocates an interdisciplinary approach to scientific inquiry and has
stated that "almost all disciplines can contribute towards an understanding of the human
mind" (p. 10).
Kaplan (1992) as an evolutionary psychologist has written about some of the issues
involved in a synthesis of humans, evolution and information. Kaplan (1992) states that
within a framework of "affective biases toward patterns of information" he states that,
"...not only information in its own right, but the concern for information is considered a
basic part of the human makeup" (p. 582). Kaplan (1992) sees "concern" as encompassing
a broad range of human affective relationships vis-à-vis information, such as "the
motivation to seek information" (p. 582) and asserts that a variety of "human affective
relationships to information...remain to be identified and conceptualized" (p. 582). Kaplan
(1992) proposes several questions related to the nexus of humans, information, and
evolution. He examines whether knowledge (i.e. information) has any relationship to
human evolution.

Interdisciplinary evolutionary psychologists Barkow, Cosmides and Tooby (1992)
and Mithen (1996) discuss conceptual integration that created anchor point links with other
fields. Tooby and Cosmides (1989) view cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology as
"sister disciplines" (p. 46). They assert that "the goal of evolutionary theory is to define the
adaptive problems that organisms must be able to solve. The goal of psychological theory
is to discover the information processing mechanisms that have evolved to solve them.
Alone, each is incomplete for the understanding of human nature. Together they are
powerful" (Tooby and Cosmides, 1989, p. 46-47).
In addition, other evolutionary psychologists are exploring cumulating information
building as a major human ability (Coe, 2003) and the extraordinary range of information
we use in comparison with other species. The famous Harvard linguist Steven Pinker
(1999, 2003) highlights the need to understand more about the extraordinary human ability
of information transfer abilities enabled by linguistic competency.
In summary, various evolutionary psychology scholars are exploring information behavior.
However, evolutionary psychology has not developed a coherent framework for
information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability. The next section of the paper examines
the evolutionary information behavior perspective emerging from information science that
is building a framework for information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability.
Evolutionary information behavior perspective
The evolutionary approach to understanding information behavior is exploring the
development of the information behaviors manifested and engaged in by humans and
exploring how evolution shaped information behavior (Spink and Currier, 2006a, b). This
approach is exploring how evolutionary changes in information behavior may mirror
cognitive and societal development as humans endeavored to fulfill needs and resolve
problems of everyday life and survival (Spink and Currier, 2006a, and b).
Consideration of evolutionary theory has recently emerged within the information
behavior perspective (Madden, Bryson and Palimi, 2006; Spink and Cole, 2005, 2006;
Spink and Currier, 2006a, b). The nature of information (Bates, 2005) and information
behavior is being increasingly understood as a product of biological evolution (Spink and
Cole, 2005, 2006) within a heuristic conceptualization and interdisciplinary framework for
examining the nexus of human beings, information behavior's and human evolution. The
goal of this research is to understand how information behaviors may have changed and
evolved across the arc of human existence and human evolution (Spink and Currier, 2006a,
b).
Spink and Cole (2005, 2006) provide an overarching and evolutionary conceptual
framework which encompasses an information behavior model, including information
seeking, foraging, sense making, retrieving, organizing and use behaviors (Spink and Cole,
2005, 2006). They argue that viewing information behavior from only one perspective, e.g.,
that humans are foragers for information, provides a limited understanding of information
behavior. Spink and Cole (2005, 2006) argue that humans engage in information seeking,
foraging, sense making, retrieving, organizing and use behaviors at different times, and that
these behaviors often occur in parallel. For example, for different tasks that are being
processed by a person at different information processing levels within cognition (Spink,
Cole and Waller, in press), a person may initiate an information seeking behavior and then
switch to information foraging and then switch to making sense of the information
retrieved.
Information behavior: a socio-cognitive ability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -265-
Spink and Currier (2006a) examine the information behavior of various individuals
from the past through their writings to begin the development of an evolutionary
perspective for our understanding of information behavior, including Napoleon Bonaparte,
Charles Darwin, Giacomo Casanova and others. They show that these persons of the past
articulated aspects of their information behaviors, including information seeking,
information organization and information use, providing tangible insights into their
information-related thoughts and actions. Spink and Currier (2006b) also provide an initial
chronological model of information behavior over human existence.
The underlying premise of Spink and Currier (2006b) is that: "Among other things
consciousness implies the ability to think about times and places and events separated from
our immediate personal circumstances. It implies the ability to use information from the
social past to anticipate and alter the social future, to build scenarios, to plan, to think
ahead, and to anticipate possible outcomes and retain [them] to act in several alternative
ways, depending on circumstances that can only be imperfectly represented at the time the
plans or scenarios are being made" (p.7).
In summary, an important link has emerged across evolutionary psychology and
information science that links information behavior and evolution. The next section extends
this interdisciplinary perspective further and discusses how information behavior is related
to and is an enabling element in Alexander's Ecological Dominance and Social
Competition/cooperation (EDSC) model using Donald's (1991) theoretical framework.
Information behavior as enabler of EDSC
Alexander's EDSC model designates human social cooperation within the group to
counter competition from other groups as the trigger that initiated physical
transformations/adaptations leading to human ecological dominance. In this article, we
discuss how EDSC is driven by information problems related to intra group cooperation
and inter group competition, leading to the need to gather, process, sort, organize and use
information about the ecology, sociality, morality, creation of culture, competition and
cooperation elements of human existence. Information behavior may have evolved as a
general adaptive protection from hostile forces and to enable human survival and
competition/cooperation.
Information behavior is an adaptation based on a developing cognitive schema,
human language systems/symbols that evolve within an individual based on innate
dispositions, developmental learning, and human culture. Information behavior evolved as
a survival imperative that drove the need to collect, synthesize and use information about
kin, during warfare about competitors, collaborators, mating strategies and sexual
reproductive partners. Information behavior via environmental scanning and human
communication is reflected in cave art (Mithen, 1996) and other forms of information
storage.
Humans developed a unique socio-cognitive ability to cognitively create
information that they then store, organize, retrieve and used. There is a critical need to
understand and incorporate information behavior into an evolutionary and life-span
understanding of human behavior. We begin this process by discussing the human brain as
a social tool and information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability inside the framework of
Donald's (1991) seminal description of the evolution of the human brain due to human
social forces of cooperation/competition.
Information behavior: a socio-cognitive ability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 5(2). 2007. -266-
Using Donald's (1991) approach, in the next section we propose an evolutionary
framework model for EDCS.
Evolutionary Framework for EDSC: Episodic, Mimetic and Theoretic.
Donald (1991) in his seminal book "The Origins of the Modern Mind" gives a
unitary theory framework for EDSC and information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability.
Obeying the unitary theory of the human brain's evolutionary development, the essence of
his thesis is that the human brain expanded in size but always had the cognitive architecture
capability for the sophisticated form of thinking we have today--"a single adaptation--
brain-size--would suffice to trigger the novel cognitive capacities of humans" (Donald,
1991, p. 106).
Donald (1991) divides the brain's evolution into three transitions, but with only one
adaptation (increase in brain size). These transitions represent the evolution of human
cognitive development from one way of modeling or representing the world around them to
a more complex way of thinking that allows more complex modeling. These transitions are:
the episodic to mimetic culture, the mimetic culture to mythic culture, and the mythic to the
theoretic culture, which is based on memory storage system (language and the rise of
writing). Episodic is what we share with apes and other primates.
The key to the brain's evolution was the human need for social communication.
Donald (1991) operationalized social communication in terms of our cognitive architecture
as the ability to create a whole object out of discrete elements in an increasing complex
narrative that was primarily developed for social reasons; for cooperation and control
within groups to better compete and survive against outside groups. This social drive drove
the evolution of the human brain because social communication required an ever increasing
complexity in methodology of human integration of the disparate elements of human
existence into a coherent narrative.
Great Leap forward theories of brain evolution such as the aforementioned Mithen
mark the great adaptation, when humans acquired language, between Homo erectus and
Homo sapiens. Donald differs from these theories because he sees the transition to
language as a logical extension of Homo erectus when what he calls the Mimetic stage of
human brain evolutionary development occurred. According to Donald (1991), the
difference between this Mimetic stage of Homo erectus and the theoretic stage of Homo
sapiens can be explained by a normal evolutionary transition of the human brain based on
natural selection. The important feature to underline in Donald's theory is that vestiges of
all three transitionary stages of brain evolutionary development are still present in the
human brain (Donald, 1991), influencing information behavior. As these vestiges are taken
into account in our model of EDSC, we will briefly describe each of these three transitions
in the next sections.
Episodic Culture: Donald (1991) creates a classification of representational strategies based
on the evolutionary stages of the human brain according to the representations of human
cognition; these are forms of mental models that allow humans to store information, that
organize their cognitive processes, and that direct human behavior, including information
behavior. Humans and most other mammals create episodic memory representations; these
are unreflective, concrete, immediate, short-term, situation-bound representations of what
occurs in front of the mammal's perceptual system. Apes, for example, can remember

signs for events and things if they are thoroughly taught these things, but their
representation strategy is based on previous episodes of the same event or thing. The
episodic mind can, however, juxtapose discrete or separate objects into a perceived
situation, giving it extreme power and utility in human day to day life. For humans, "the
type of memory that is important in social relationships is, above all, episodic memory"
(Donald, 1991, p. 157).
Episodic to Mimetic Culture: The first transition in the evolution of the human brain was
from episodic to a mimetic representation capability, a transition which distinguished
humans from other mammals. The mental modeling becomes much more sophisticated
where instead of specific events or situations human experience is modeled into some form
of integrated form. An illustration of the "integrative capability of mimesis" is creating,
duplicating and passing on rhythmic expressions of human experience (Donald, 1991).
Mimetic modeling is involved in the "invention and practice of sport, games, dance, ritual,
and craft" but without verbal thought as mimetic culture is nonlinguistic. Donald
hypothesizes that Mimetic skill developed for social reasons, but in any case once it was
established Mimetic skill led to advances in cultural development; it provided society with
the skill to model itself (Donald, 1991). Mimetic culture is extremely useful today in civic
and religious rituals where collective thought occurs; such exchanges are more common
than most modern humans think (Donald, 1991). Mimetic expression was present in Homo
erectus in games, tool making and ritual and standardized gestures done in a social setting.
Mimetic representational capacity in Homo erectus, according to Donald (1991), set the
stage for semantic memory storage, symbols, and the theoretic mind of Homo sapiens. In
effect, mimetic representations serve as an interim stage between episodic and symbolic
cultures in human brain development--i.e., the development of tools, for example, would
have required some form of rudimentary symbolic representation to pass on the skill to the
next generation.
Mimetic to Mythic Culture: The social role--i.e., to promote social cohesion and
cooperation--of Mimetic skill was reinforced, according to Donald (1991), by the invention
of myth. A society myth is a conceptual model of the human universe or existence inside
the objective or physical environment. Myth builds up over generations and is the narrative
for a specific human social group to be used to compete against other groups "In
conquering a rival society, the first act of the conquerors is to impose their myth on the
conquered" (Donald, 1991, p. 258). The power positions in that society are those who
uphold and control the parameters of the group's predominant myth, the priests and
shamans. The Mimetic skill is "the prototypal, fundamental, integrative mind tool"
(Donald, 1991, p. 215), both at the level of the individual in the society and, more
importantly, for the social group itself, unifying its members to compete against other
groups it comes into contact with. The increasing size and complexity of larger social
groups, which could defeat smaller social groups they were in competition, required more
efficient social relationships; they needed to be conceptualized and controlled. Language
developed to facilitate myth development and transmission, not as it is commonly
conceived the other way around: "The most important source of selection pressure for an
improved vocal apparatus would have been a mind that needed the features of vocal
language for its modeling agenda" (Donald, 1991, p. 220).

Theoretic Culture: Language was an adaptation "that met specific cognitive and culture
needs," which can be specifically labeled as "the formalization and unification of thought
and knowledge" into theoretic systems (Donald, 1991, p. 216). Theoretic thinking was a
much more powerful form of thinking than what had come before in the Mimetic culture.
Theoretic culture includes analytic thought, grammatical invention, memory-management
skills, attentional algorithms and the development of theories linking concepts together in
abstract thought (Donald, 1991, p. 378). Theoretic concepts create symbols such as the
equal sign that are what Gregory (1981) calls "mind-tools", which capture a nascent mental
model for a concept, allowing it to be used for storage, cognitive manipulation leading to
generative information/knowledge processes.
Mythic to Theoretic Culture: The adaptive pressure driven by natural selection favored
social groups with the greatest ability to symbolically model the world around them in a
distinctively human reconstruction of reality. This is speeded up by human drive to increase
the size of external memory in written text and computer systems.
Model of Information in EDSC and Information Behavior
Figure 1 starts from Alexander's (1990b) EDSC model and the centrality of man as
a social being in our evolutionary story, we model Donald's (1991) unitary theory of
human brain evolution. Donald's (1991) theory provides an overview of the evolution of
human cognition based on knowledge structures stored in the human LTS. These
knowledge structures provide information processing mechanisms in the STS for decoding
and encoding operations in human memory which take place when environmental stimuli
input enters the cognitive system.
According to this thesis, human brain evolution is driven forward by inter-group
competition leading to intra-group social cooperation, which over the course of human
evolutionary history has created an ever more complex human ability to create mental
models of the human physical and social environmental and the place of humans in that
environment. The driving force of this evolution is to form the integration of human
experience into a coherent narrative of human existence. This narrative enables social
cohesion within the group to more effectively compete against the other groups competing
for limited resources.
In Figure 1 we model the human socio-cognitive ability as a system of inputs and
outputs. The inputs are sense data from the physical and social environment, anomalies and
knowledge from the social group and the individual. The outputs are greater social
cooperation leading to increased efficiency when competing with outside groups for limited
environmental resources. The integrative mind tools are located in the middle of Figure 1
and act as propulsions for transforming input data, anomalies and knowledge into social
cooperation/competition outputs. We have listed the integrative mind tools systems of
thinking capabilities vested in the human brain at various points over the course of human
evolution, from episodic culture early on in evolution to theoretic culture in the present day.

Figure 1: Information behavior framework: a socio-cognitive ability
According to Donald (1991), these systems alternate control with each other
depending on the circumstances, driving information behavior. Cognitive aspects of human
socio-cognitive ability are briefly referred to at the top of Figure 1. Donald (1991)
hypothesizes that while primates, as well as humans, have episodic memory (i.e., memory
for discrete events); the semantic drive to integrate the events of human existence into some
sort of coherent narrative is a feature of cognition.

In the Figure 1 model, we rely on two major components:
1. that the evolution of the human brain is driven by human modeling of the
environment by integrating discrete events and things together into an increasingly
complex narrative; and
2. that all phases of brain development are still present influencing information
behavior, the focus of the model, and should thus be accounted for in our model
(Donald, 1991; Smith, 2006).
This evolutionary perspective on information behavior and what constitutes
information is a significant new view for information science. All phases of human
evolution are present and operating in the human mind we have now, indicating that the
episodic, mimetic, myth and theoretic minds all contribute tools to the human arsenal to
achieve the evolutionary outputs of cooperation and competition.
In the hybrid scheme proposed here, the functional locus of "consciousness" can
shift, depending upon the representational system currently in command" (Donald,
1991, p. 369).
An important conclusion is that all four types of minds motivate information
behaviors.
Conclusion and further research
In this paper we have incorporated models and theories that highlight information
behavior as primarily a social construct, driven by a survival mechanism that found its
competition for survival in other human social groups rather than the environment itself as
was the case with all other species. The evolution of social cultures created different human
methods of representing and modeling human thought, and the transition from one socially
derived method of mental modeling, from episodic to mimetic to myth to theoretic, drove
brain development. Social cultures exist in the present human brain and thus influence
information behavior.
In this paper we sketched the way intra-group cooperation to survive against inter
group competition drives evolution. There is a communication aspect to creating
cooperation. It drives the human to put a coherent narrative of human existence into
symbolic form so that it can be communicated to others in the group. Information behavior
in terms of both inputs and outputs as described in Figure 1 takes on various forms to
further this communication drive. Information behavior is a socio-cognitive ability which
humans have various aptitudes for; but on the level of Homo sapiens it is a species socio-
cognitive ability that has ensured human cooperation, competition and survival, and lead to
the increased pace of our evolution in an environment where there are no rival species.
Further theoretical and empirical research is needed to more fully explore these
issues and examine the nature of information behavior as a socio-cognitive ability to fully
grasp the relationship between information behavior and evolution. The evolutionary
approach to understanding information behavior represents a significant intellectual shift
that promotes connections between the human past and present, and at all way stations
along the human evolutionary path. This approach reshapes the frame and refines the lens
through which humans are able to look holistically at their past, present, and future
information behavior's in a temporally-expanded information-relevant context.
