Abstract
Background: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is examining options for regulating menthol
content in cigarettes. There are many pharmacologic properties of menthol that may facilitate exposure to
tobacco smoke, and it has been suggested that the preference for menthol cigarettes in black smokers accounts
for their higher cotinine levels.
Objective: To assess cigarettes smoked per day­adjusted cotinine levels in relation to smoking a menthol or
nonmenthol cigarette brand among non-Hispanic black and white U.S. adult smokers under natural smoking
conditions.
Method: Serum cotinine concentrations were measured in 1,943 smokers participating in the 2001 to 2006
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). The effect of smoking a menthol brand on
cigarettes smoked per day­adjusted serum cotinine levels in these two populations was modeled by adjusting
for sex, age, number of smokers living in the home, body weight, time since last smoked, and FTC (Federal
Trade Commission)-measured nicotine levels. The 8- or 12-digit Universal Product Code (UPC) on the
cigarette label was used to determine the cigarette brand and whether it was menthol.
Results: Smoking a menthol cigarette brand versus smoking a nonmenthol cigarette brand was not
associated (P ! 0.05) with mean serum cotinine concentration in either black or white smokers.
Conclusions: The higher levels of cotinine observed in black smokers compared with white smokers are not
explained by their higher preference for menthol cigarette brands.
Impact: Further studies like ours are needed to improve our ability to understand health consequences of
future changes in tobacco product design. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 20(7); 1329­40. Ó2011 AACR.
Introduction
Cotinine is the primary proximate metabolite of nico-
tine. On an average, 72% of nicotine is converted to
cotinine, ranging from 55% to 92% (1). The half-life
cotinine is 16 to 19 hours and its ready availability in
saliva, blood, and urine makes it widely practical as a
biomarker of nicotine uptake and exposure to both active
and secondhand tobacco smoke. For smokers with a fairly
consistent smoking pattern (about 80% of adult smokers
report smoking each day; ref. 2), serum cotinine levels
reach a steady state, varying only by 15% to 20% over the
course of the day with lower levels usually in the morning
as there is typically minimal exposure to cigarette smoke
overnight (1). Racial and ethnic differences in the number
of cigarettes smoked per day (cpd; refs. 3­5) and in serum
cotinine concentration per cigarette smoked have been
well established (6­11). In U.S. studies, non-Hispanic
black smokers (hereafter referred to as black) have con-
sistently been found to have higher serum cotinine con-
centrations per cigarette smoked than non-Hispanic
white smokers (hereafter referred to as white; refs.
7,10). The reasons for these differences are not well
understood but may include a combination of factors,

among them cigarette characteristics (e.g., menthol/non-
menthol, mainstream smoke levels of nicotine), smoking
topography (e.g., puff volume, depth of inhalation, reten-
tion time of smoke in the lungs), and differences in
nicotine metabolism or elimination among individual
smokers.
There are over 1,000 brands and subbrands of cigar-
ettes that are sold in the United States (12). Most recent
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) data show that menthol
brands represented about 26% to 27% of market share of
cigarettes between 2003 and 2005. The leading menthol
cigarette brands sold in the United States during that
period were Newport, Marlboro Menthol, Kool, and
Salem; however, there are many other menthol cigarette
brands that are sold in the United States. The leading
menthol brands, similar to nonmenthol brands, have a
variety of subbrands. These menthol subbrands of the
same brand vary in FTC-measured nicotine levels. For
example, the leading menthol brand Newport has sub-
brands which range in FTC-measured1 nicotine levels
from 0.8 mg (Newport Slim Light) to 1.4 mg (Newport);
Marlboro Menthol has subbrands in which nicotine
yields vary from 0.5 mg (Marlboro Menthol Ultra Light)
to 1.2 mg (Marlboro Menthol 100s); Kool from 0.2 mg
(Kool Ultra) to 1.4 mg (Kool Super Longs); and Salem
from 0.5 mg (Salem Ultra Lights) to 1.4 mg (Salem).
Similarly, these menthol brands and its subbrands also
have different concentrations of the additive menthol in
it; however, menthol is also present at low levels in many
nonmenthol brands. In a study conducted by Celebucki
and colleagues (13), the authors found that subbrands of
Newport ranged in menthol per cigarette and in menthol
per gram of tobacco. In addition to the type of cigarettes
smoked (menthol or nonmenthol, amount of menthol,
amount of nicotine), cigarettes are smoked differently
(e.g., puff volume, depth of inhalation, retention time
of smoke in the lungs, potential blocking ventilation
holes) and differences in nicotine metabolism or elimina-
tion among individual smokers and between racial
groups exist.
Documenting and quantifying differences in serum
cotinine concentration between smokers of menthol
and nonmenthol brands (within and between race com-
parisons) are best done under natural smoking conditions
as opposed to conditions set in a laboratory. Serum
cotinine variability has been extensively studied in rela-
tion to race/ethnicity. Number of cigarettes smoked per
day, and to a smaller degree, cigarette types like menthol
have also been studied. However, these 3 factors are
highly interrelated, and their independent effects on
cotinine levels have not been well studied.
We report here an assessment of serum cotinine levels
using models based on nationally representative data that
simultaneously include number of cigarettes smoked per
day, race, and smoking a menthol or nonmenthol cigar-
ette brand.
Cotinine is a biomarker of current exposure to nicotine.
Because the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is
examining options for regulating menthol cigarettes, it
is important to determine whether smoking a menthol
brand is associated with higher nicotine uptake under
natural smoking conditions. Such information may help
to understand reasons for the disparities between the risk
of smoking-related diseases and aspects of nicotine
dependence such as quit rate between black smokers
and white smokers in the United States.
Methods
We measured serum cotinine concentrations among a
nationally representative sample of white and black
smokers according to the type of cigarettes they smoked
in the past 2 days. Specifically, we determined serum
cotinine concentrations as a function of self-reported
cigarettes per day among the 2 racial groups by type
of cigarette. Cigarette type was determined by the brand
they smoked at the time of the home interview and
categorized as menthol or nonmenthol, as well as by
pack descriptors and data reported annually to the Fed-
eral Trade Commission (FTC) for mainstream smoke
nicotine yield. The serum cotinine concentration was first
preadjusted for the day the last cigarette was smoked
(today or yesterday), the number of smokers who smoked
inside the home in the past 7 days, whether the subject
physically showed the cigarette pack to the interviewer in
the home interview, age, and body weight, as subse-
quently described.
Description of NHANES
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) consists of a number of question-
naires administered in the household followed by
standardized physical examinations and additional
tobacco use questions administered in specially
equipped mobile examination centers (MEC), which
on an average occur about 2 weeks after the household
interview. The NHANES target population is the civi-
lian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. This nation-
ally representative sample permits calculation of
national estimates. Related to our study, NHANES
oversamples low-income persons, persons 60þ years
of age, and non-Hispanic blacks. We used NHANES
data collected between January 2001 and December
2006. The overall response rate to NHANES for 2001
to 2006 was 78%.
1In 2008, the FTC rescinded guidance issued in 1966 that generally
permitted statements concerning tar and nicotine yields if they were based
on the Cambridge Filter Method, sometimes called the FTC method. At the
time, the Commission believed that giving consumers uniform, standar-
dized information about tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes would help
them make informed decisions about the cigarettes they smoked. In 2008,
however, the scientific consensus was that machine-based measure-
ments of tar and nicotine yields based on the Cambridge Filter Method
did not provide meaningful information on the amounts of tar and nicotine
smokers received from cigarettes, thus the FTC method was flawed. The
FTC method is no longer valid to provide information to consumers about
tar and nicotine yields in cigarettes.

The MEC tobacco questionnaire, administered via
computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), asked par-
ticipants, "During the past 5 days, on the days {you/he/
she} smoked, how many cigarettes did {you/he/she}
smoke each day?" This number was our independent
variable. Cigarettes smoked per day was not a calculated
variable. It is a directly reported respondent impression
of the "average" number of cigarettes smoked, on the days
they smoked cigarettes. NHANES did not ask for the
numbers of cigarettes smoked on each of the last 5 days
but did ask when they smoked their last cigarette (today,
yesterday). Finally, another MEC questionnaire item
asked about when the respondent smoked last: "When
did {you/he/she} smoke {your/his/her} last cigarette?"
Possible responses were "today," "yesterday," or "3 to
5 days ago." Those who answered "3 to 5 days ago" were
excluded from the analyses.
The analytic sample for this study included smokers
aged 20 years and older who had smoked on the day of or
on the day preceding the MEC visit, who were recoded by
NHANES as non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black/
African American, who had a serum cotinine measure-
ment and provided tobacco use information in the MEC.
We excluded smokers who had used any other tobacco
product (pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or snuff) or
nicotine patches, gum, or other nicotine products during
the 5 days preceding the MEC visit.
Of the 11,171 white or black adults aged 20 years and
older who completed the NHANES home interview,
10,504 (94.0%) visited the MECs; 9,668 answered the
MEC tobacco questionnaire. Of these, 2,188 had smoked
cigarettes during the past 5 days and had a serum
cotinine measurement. Of these, 2,095 had smoked on
the day of or the day preceding the MEC exam; 2,034
reported using no sources of nicotine other than cigar-
ettes. Among these, 91 were excluded due to missing
cigarette brand information. The final analytic sample
consisted of 1,943 individuals.
Menthol cigarette brand
During the CAPI household interview, respondents
were asked whether they now smoke cigarettes every
day, some days, or not at all. Respondents who indicated
they smoke every day or some days were asked to show
their cigarette pack for the cigarette brand they usually
smoke. Interviewers then entered the 8- or 12-digit Uni-
versal Product Code (UPC) into the computer, which then
displayed the brand name from a stored list for verifica-
tion by the respondent. If the respondent's brand was not
displayed or the respondent did not show the pack, the
brand (reported by the respondent) was selected from a
list of brands/types. If the respondent's usual brand was
not on the computer list, the interviewer asked the
respondent about the usual brand's characteristics to help
classify the brand according to filter, menthol, length, and
packaging categories. Approximately 80.0% (n ¼ 1,546) of
study participants showed their cigarette pack and about
20.0% (n ¼ 397) provided information about the usual
brand's characteristics. Using this method, we deter-
mined whether the cigarette brand currently smoked
by the respondent was menthol or nonmenthol.
Individual level measures
Demographics and exposure to secondhand smoke
were measured by using CAPI. Most interviews were
conducted in the home. Race and ethnicity were based on
self-report. Age at interview was categorized as 20 to 24,
25 to 44, 45 to 64, or 65 or more years. Each respondent's
weight in kilograms, measured by using a digital scale,
was categorized as less than 60, 60 to 69.99, 70 to 79.99,
and 80 kg or more. Reported exposure to secondhand
smoke at home was based on the following questions
posed to 1 member of the household (usually the head of
the family or spouse of the head): "Does anyone who live
here smoke cigarettes in the home?" The number of
household members who smoked cigarettes in the home
was categorized as 0 or 1 (not exposed or exposed).
Source for cigarette nicotine data
In addition to cigarette brand characteristics obtained
directly from the cigarette pack or from the smoker's
report, we obtained machine-generated nicotine levels
from annual reports to the FTC (12). These were cate-
gorically coded in NHANES at the time of the UPC
match, if any. FTC machine­determined levels were
linked to each respondent's brand by first matching
the brand name and characteristics provided by the
participant to the brand characteristics (brand name,
package type, and menthol) in the FTC listing of main-
stream smoke yields by brand and variety (12).
Respondent's brand was matched to the FTC data for
the year of the NHANES interview or the most recent
year available prior to the year of the NHANES inter-
view (14). These were also augmented by the merging of
data from the FTC (15). The augmented data contained
secondary sources for brand nicotine in addition to
brand name, length, filter, package type, strength,
and menthol. A combined outcome was created by
selecting the UPC outcome for each cigarette attribute,
if a match with the UPC database occurred and there
was useable data, otherwise the original NHANES
determination was used. We conducted analyses using
FTC nicotine levels as a continuous variable. For illus-
tration purposes, we used 0.8 and 1.1 mg of FTC
machine­measured nicotine levels.
Serum cotinine measurement
Biochemical determination of tobacco exposure was
performed by measuring serum cotinine levels in blood
specimens obtained by venipuncture in the MEC. The
cotinine assay involved isotope dilution, liquid chroma-
tography, and tandem mass spectrometry. Cotinine data
are reported in nanograms per milliliter. The limit of
detection (LOD) for this procedure was 0.015 ng/mL
(16). No smoker in the study had serum cotinine con-
centrations below LOD.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out in 2 stages.
Stage 1: Preadjustment and removal of nuisance variation.
First, serum cotinine levels were adjusted for sources of
nuisance variation within each of the 4 race/ethnicity
times sex categories. Nuisance variables were as follows:
time since last smoked (today), whether the respondent
showed his/her cigarette pack (yes), and number of
smokers in the home (only the respondent). We did not
adjust for cigarettes smoked per day in stage 1, as this was
the focus of the stage 2 analysis. Nonlinear and quadratic
functions of age, sex, and body weight were also used to
improve the adjustment for those not in the appropriate
reference category. Predicted serum cotinine levels for
respondent covariate combinations not in the reference
categories were calculated by setting the covariates to
these reference levels before calculating the predicted
values. The ratio of predicted cotinine values for reference
covariate levels to predicted cotinine values for observed
covariate levels was calculated. Adjusted cotinine values
were calculated by multiplying the observed cotinine
values by this ratio. We also preadjusted for time since
last cigarette. We preadjusted for the decay by using
regression to predict within each race and sex what the
cotinine would have been had they been measured on the
day they smoked their last cigarette (i.e., today). Those
results, for all adjustment factors, were generally consis-
tent in the direction of the change in the coefficient signs
across all 4 races by sex strata, which lends some addi-
tional internal validity to the approach. The amount of
adjustment was data driven through the coefficient mag-
nitude within each race and sex. The procedure simulta-
neously accounted for other factors such as age and body
weight. The resulting models were adequately fit and
highly consistent. People who smoked their last cigarette
3 to 5 days ago were excluded from the analyses because
of considerably more variability in serum cotinine con-
centration than those who smoked the day blood was
collected or the day before.
Stage 2: Exponential models for cigarettes per day by menthol
brand status. In the second stage, nuisance-adjusted coti-
nine values were regressed on cigarettes per day and
cigarette menthol status, controlling for FTC-measured
nicotine levels, respondent body weight, and gender.
Survey weights were used to adjust for differing prob-
abilities of selection, nonresponse, and to adjust the
sample to reflect the demographic distribution of the
U.S. population. SAS was used for all analyses. We
assessed the adequacy of the fit of the exponential regres-
sion models by using plots of the residuals versus the
predicted values.
Determination of adjusted serum cotinine levels by the
number of cigarettes smoked per day and menthol brand
status involved fitting nonlinear exponential regression
models of the form: ln(adjusted cotinine þ 1.0) ¼ b0
­ b1
exp (­b2
X) þ error, where ln(Á) is the natural logarithm; X
is the number of self-reported cigarettes smoked per day;
b0
, b1
, and b2
are parameters that describe the exponential
relationship; and error is the residual error left unex-
plained by the model. This exponential equation models
serum cotinine as a monotonically increasing function of
the number of cigarettes smoked, with cotinine increas-
ing at a decreasing rate toward an upper asymptote. The
variable b0
represents the upper bound (maximum
achievable level) of ln(adjusted cotinine þ 1.0) at the
highest levels of daily smoking, and b1
and b2
work
together to control the span and steepness curvature of
how cotinine increases with daily consumption.
The base model, stratified by race (separate models
were run by race), included the 3 parameters described
above. After fitting the base model, 2 different covariate
adjusted models were fit. Model 1 investigated the rela-
tionship between serum cotinine and cigarettes smoked
per day after adjustment for FTC nicotine levels, body
weight, and gender. Model 2 added cigarette menthol
status to the model 1 variables.
In a preliminary investigation, we analyzed the data
with and without the stage 1 adjustment and the models
were similar, except that the stage 1 adjustment resulted
in serum cotinine intercepts closer to the origin, as would
be expected if all nuisance factors were accounted for
when cigarettes per day is near 0.
Results
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic characteristics
and the type of cigarettes smoked for white and black
smokers. c2 tests of the association between race and
sociodemographic and cigarette characteristics showed
that the distributions were statistically different (P < 0.01)
across the 2 racial groups. While white smokers had a
similar proportion of men and women (51.8% men, 48.2%
women), black smokers were predominantly men
(61.9%). Also, age distribution differences were observed
among smokers by race. Only 19.5% of white smokers
were living below the poverty level, whereas about 31.7%
of black smokers were living below the poverty level.
Differences in body weight were also observed; a higher
proportion of black smokers (50.3%) weighed 80 kg or
more compared with 43.4% of white smokers. A higher
proportion of black smokers were exposed to secondhand
smoke in the home (78.9%) compared with white smokers
(69.6%).
As expected, only a minority (19.4%) of the sample of
white smokers smoked menthol cigarettes, whereas the
majority (73.9%) of black smokers smoked a menthol
brand. Accordingly, black smokers smoked cigarette
brands that were on an average higher in FTC-measured
nicotine than white smokers, as the specific menthol
brands smoked by black smokers (e.g., Newport) had
higher FTC machine­determined deliveries of nicotine
than nonmenthol brands smoked by white smokers (e.g.,
Marlboro Light). About 3 of 4 white and black smokers
smoked their last cigarette the same day their blood was

drawn. About 9 of 10 white and black smokers reported
smoking every day. Finally, black smokers smoked fewer
cigarettes per day than white smokers.
Figure 1 illustrates cumulative percentages of FTC-
measured nicotine levels of the cigarettes smoked by
white and black smokers. Menthol cigarettes smoked
by black smokers (1.24 mg) were on an average higher
in FTC nicotine levels to the menthol cigarettes (0.94 mg)
smoked by white smokers (P < 0.01). Nonmenthol cigar-
ettes smoked by black smokers (1.01 mg) were on an
average higher in FTC nicotine levels to the nonmenthol
cigarettes (0.88 mg) smoked by white smokers (P < 0.01).
Finally, for white smokers, the menthol cigarettes (0.94
mg) they smoked were on an average higher in FTC
nicotine levels than the nonmenthol cigarettes (0.88
mg) they smoked (P < 0.05).
Unadjusted analysis shows that at the lowest cigarette
smoking level (1­3 cpd), black smokers had geometric
mean serum cotinine concentrations (94.4 ng/mL) almost
3 times that of white smokers (32.7 ng/mL; Table 2). The
median number of cigarettes smoked in whites was 18
and the median in blacks was 10 (results not shown).

Table 3 shows statistical comparisons of model-
adjusted serum cotinine levels between white and black
smokers. Comparisons in predicted cotinine levels were
made at each combination of the following covariates:
FTC 0.8 mg and FTC 1.1 mg of cigarette nicotine, menthol,
and non-menthol cigarettes; body weights of 150 lbs and
200 lbs; and cigarettes smoked per day categories of 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25. Model 1 in Table 3 fits nicotine, sex, and
body weight as a function of cpd before any effects of
menthol are considered. For most combinations of the
covariates, blacks' predicted cotinine levels exceeded
whites' predicted cotinine levels, more so for females
than males. Model 2 adds menthol main effects and
menthol Â nicotine interaction terms to model 1. Blacks'
predicted cotinine levels were still greater than whites'
predicted cotinine levels, although there were somewhat
fewer combinations where these differences were statis-
tically significant.
We also used models 1 and 2 to test whether the
addition of the menthol variables significantly improved
the fit of the model. The addition of the menthol variables,
after controlling for nicotine, sex, and body weight, was
not a significant predictor of serum cotinine within either
white (F ¼ 0.5, P ¼ 0.79) or black smokers (F ¼ 1.9, P ¼
0.10). Also, we did not find that smoking a menthol brand
has an effect on serum cotinine concentration among
white or black adult smokers even when we did not
control for FTC machine­determined deliveries of nico-
tine levels (P > 0.05).
Discussion
Using an exponential model that takes into account
individual smoker characteristics (age, sex, body weight)
and smoking behavior (cpd), we found no differences in
serum cotinine concentration for white or black smokers

when using UPC-assessed menthol versus nonmenthol
brands. The potential health risks associated with
menthol flavoring of cigarettes is a topic of considerable
interest, in part because menthol cigarettes are dispro-
portionately preferred by black smokers. It has been
proposed that the anesthetic and cooling sensation prop-
erties of menthol allow smokers of menthol cigarettes to
inhale more smoke from each cigarette than smokers of
nonmenthol cigarettes (17, 18). It has been hypothesized
that the resulting higher smoke exposure over time
results in higher smoking-related diseases among smo-
kers of menthol cigarettes (19). As previously stated, our
results showed that a higher percent of black smokers
smoked a menthol cigarette brand and cigarettes with a
higher FTC nicotine level than white smokers. Also, on an
average, the specific menthol brand and subbrands black
smokers smoked had a higher FTC nicotine levels than
the nonmenthol brands (the preferred type of cigarette
smoked by whites) smoked by white smokers.
At least 2 previous studies have found higher cotinine
concentrations among smokers of mentholated cigarettes
(20, 21), whereas others did not (22­27). In a recent study

of nicotine and nitrosamine metabolites in smokers, Mus-
cat and colleagues findings suggested that "menthol does
not affect biological exposure to tobacco smoke constitu-
ents," although it may inhibit detoxification of the lung
carcinogen 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-buta-
nol (NNAL; ref. 25). In our study, we found no evidence
of higher serum cotinine concentrations among smokers
(white or black) of menthol cigarettes compared to smo-
kers of nonmentholated cigarettes when smoking the
same number of cigarettes smoked per day. Among black
smokers specifically, we found no differences in serum
cotinine concentration between smokers of menthol and
nonmenthol cigarettes, nor in the number of cigarettes
smoked per day even after adjustment for the FTC nico-
tine yield (9.1 vs. 9.3, respectively; results not shown);
likewise, we found no differences in the number of
cigarettes smoked per day by whites who smoked
mentholated or nonmentholated cigarettes (results not
shown). In contrast, in a cross-sectional study of 19,545
smokers hospitalized for non­tobacco-related diseases,
Muscat and colleagues noted that among both whites and
blacks, menthol brands were more often listed by smo-
kers of 1 pack per day or less, compared with heavier
smokers (28). In particular, black and white smokers of
menthol cigarettes did not have higher mean serum
cotinine concentrations than smokers of nonmenthol
cigarettes. If serum cotinine concentration is, in fact, a
proxy for overall smoke exposure, our findings provide
no evidence of higher exposure to overall smoke among
smokers of menthol brands. This conclusion would be
strengthened by data showing no effect of cigarette
mentholation status on smoking topography and by
patterns of cigarette consumption by mainstream smoke
menthol levels.
A key question that remains to be answered is what
accounts for racial differences in serum cotinine concen-
trations between black and white smokers if smoking a
menthol or nonmenthol brand does not explain the
difference? (7) When looking at racial differences by
FTC-measured nicotine levels, levels that in fact are
highly correlated with menthol cigarette brands, we
found that black smokers consistently had higher serum
cotinine concentrations at a cpd of 5 of less than white
smokers regardless of the FTC-measured nicotine level
(0.8 or 1.1 mg). In a study conducted by P
erez-Stable and
colleagues in a clinical investigation of smokers who
smoked half to one pack per day, they concluded that
the higher levels of serum cotinine concentrations in
black smokers compared with white smokers was
explained by higher nicotine intake (30% more) per
cigarette and slower cotinine clearance in the black sub-
jects (29). The NHANES data we used for our study
showed a much higher intake of nicotine per cigarette
in black smokers, especially at the lower levels of cigar-
ettes smoked per day. We found that at lower levels of
cigarette smoking (1­3 and 4­9 cpd), black smokers had
serum cotinine levels almost 200% to 300% higher than
that of white smokers, and at higher smoking levels (!10
cpd), they were 22% to 35% higher in black smokers than
white smokers. It is important to note that serum cotinine
concentration increased rapidly up to 10 to 15 cpd, more
so among black smokers than white smokers, before
leveling off at approximately 15 to 20 cpd. Muscat and
colleagues (30) pointed out that this plateau effect partly
explains why the frequency of daily smoking is only
moderately correlated with cotinine levels. Because the
smokers studied by P
erez-Stable and colleagues all
smoked one half pack or more per day, it is unknown
whether there are even greater racial differences in intake
or clearance at low levels of smoking that would account
for our findings. It is possible that other factors such as
extreme inhalation at the lowest levels of cigarette smok-
ing (<10 cpd) and time to first cigarette after waking may
explain some of these differences. The higher percent of
blacks in NHANES who were at the poverty level might
explain the much higher intake smoke, where persons of
low income need to maximize their nicotine intake per
cigarette. Finally, more research needs to be conducted to
assess why black females appear to be different from
white females in serum cotinine concentration.
Our study has limitations. As mentioned, we were not
able to measure the actual concentration of menthol on
each cigarette brand smoked by smokers in this study,
although the difference in mainstream smoke menthol
concentration between menthol and nonmenthol brands
is an order of magnitude greater than the between-brand
difference for any 2 menthol brands (13). Still, our study
assessed the relation between smoking a menthol brand
and serum cotinine levels and not the relation of the
amount of menthol in each cigarette brand and serum
cotinine levels. Second, cigarette brands, including
menthol brands, may have changed over time in the
amount of menthol flavoring or nicotine they have in
it; thus, our study is specific to brands used by smokers in
the United States between 2001 and 2006.
Our study also has some methodologic advantages
over previous population-or laboratory-based studies.
First, our study sample represents the U.S. noninstitutio-
nalized population, including smokers, and thus we were
able to assess serum cotinine concentrations among smo-
kers in the United States who smoked their cigarettes
under natural smoking conditions. Second, the informa-
tion we collected on cigarette brand was collected first by
the interviewer looking at the pack used by the smoker
and then verified using the specific UPC bar code infor-
mation on the side of the cigarette pack, allowing accurate
ascertainment of whether the brand was menthol or
nonmenthol. In contrast, self-reports of types of cigarettes
smoked are subject to bias (31).
The dangers of smoking have been known for dec-
ades (32, 33), and during that period, many policy
options for reducing those dangers have been devel-
oped (34, 35). The focus on tar, nicotine, and carbon
monoxide testing after the 1964 report on smoking and
health (32) led to multiple product changes (36), but
these product changes did not promote public health.

(37) The FDA now has the authority to regulate cigarette
additives and labels, smokeless tobacco, and roll your
own tobacco and the potential to change the landscape
of accessibility to cigarettes and other tobacco products.
FDA can also require changes in the composition of
tobacco products, reduce the amount of nicotine in
cigarettes, and require changes in other potentially
harmful ingredients to reduce exposure to toxic and
carcinogenic emissions in people who continue to use
the products and nonusers exposed to the smoke of
some of these products. The FDA is now examining
options for regulating menthol cigarettes; although,
there is no statutory requirement for FDA to make a
decision or take action on menthol cigarettes. Formula-
tion and implementation of product-based policies
require further studies like ours as part of an effort to
improve our ability to predict metabolic, behavioral,
and health consequences of changes in tobacco product
design.
