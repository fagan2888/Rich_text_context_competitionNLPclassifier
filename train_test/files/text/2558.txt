Objectives. Middle-aged adults often provide support to aging parents, but researchers know little about support that
young adults provide middle-aged parents. This study examined support that young adults provide parents and explana-
tions for that support from both offspring's and parents' perspectives.
Method.Young adults (n = 515, mean age = 22.34) and their parents (n = 364, mean age = 50.09) from the Family
Exchanges Study reported support that offspring provide parents. Participants also reported parental personal problems,
parental disability status, relationship quality, and support that parents provide offspring.
Results.Offspring provided parents with emotional support and listening more often than other forms of support.
Offspring reported providing more frequent support than parents reported receiving. We examined factors associated
with support using multilevel models. Both offspring and parents reported more frequent support provided to parents
when they had higher quality relationships and when parents gave more frequent support to offspring. Offspring (but not
parents) reported providing more frequent support to parents when parents were disabled.
Discussion. Findings are consistent with solidarity theory, which suggests that high-quality relationships may explain
support. The concept of self-enhancement and generativity in middle-aged parents may explain the intergenerational dif-
ferences in the association between parental disability and support.
Key Words: Family--Intergenerational relationships--Social support.
INTERGENERATIONAL support plays a key role in the
material and psychological well-being of family mem-
bers (Bengtson, 2001; Cheng, Li, Leung, & Chan, 2011;
Davey & Eggebeen, 1998). Researchers have documented
help that middle-aged adults provide to their older parents
(Katz, Gur-Yaish, & Lowenstein, 2010; Zarit & Eggebeen,
2002). Middle-aged adults tend to support aging parents
when parents are in need (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998), have
close intergenerational ties (Schwarz, Trommsdorff, Albert,
& Mayer, 2005), and when in response to support that par-
ents provided (Silverstein, Conroy, Wang, Giarrusso, &
Bengtson, 2002). However, it is not clear whether these sup-
port patterns found among middle-aged offspring are also
evident among young adult offspring.
Young adults may provide support to parents, albeit with
different type of support (Silverstein & Giarrusso, 2010).
Indeed, a study in Europe documented emotional and prac-
tical support young adults provide to parents (Bucx, van
Wel, & Knijn, 2012). In Asian countries, young adults also
may provide financial support to parents (Kim, Cheng,
Fingerman, & Zarit, in press). However, it is not clear what
types of support that young adults in the United States pro-
vide their parents.
This study examined young adults' support to middle-
aged parents with a U.S. sample and contributes to the
literature in three ways: (a) by examining several different
types of support (e.g., listening to parents talk about their
daily lives, practical, financial, and technological support),
(b) by including both offspring and parent reports of sup-
port provided to parents, and (c) by considering reasons that
may underlie young adults' support of parents.
Types of Support Young Adult Offspring Provide
The types of support that young adults provide parents
may be associated with the characteristics of emerging
adulthood (Arnett, 2007). In the twenty-first century, youth
tend to experience delayed marriage, difficulty obtaining
full-time jobs, and extended education (Furstenberg, 2010).
Due to these prolonged transitions, adult offspring have few
responsibilities or ties that pull them away from their fam-
ily of origin. Moreover, current technologies allow them to
engage in frequent contact via e-mail, text messaging, and
cell phones (Lefkowitz, Vukman, & Loken, 2012). Thus,
young adults may provide companionship and advice, lend
a listening ear, and offer emotional support to parents on a
frequent basis. However, longer transitions into adulthood
may also limit their monetary resources. Studies from the
Netherlands examining financial support revealed that young
adults gave little money to parents (Bucx et al., 2012). This
support pattern may be similar in the United States.
407
CHENG ET AL.
Young adults may also provide practical support to par-
ents. In United States, norms of filial obligation require off-
spring to provide practical support and care when parents
incur health problems in late life and require support (Gans
& Silverstein, 2006). Although young adults may not be
expected to provide care for their parents, they may help
with a variety of every day chores such as running errands,
offering rides, or remodeling or moving.
Technological support may be another type of assis-
tance that young adults provide their parents. Technological
advances, such as computers, the Internet, and cell phones,
have become an essential feature of family life (Kennedy,
Smith, Wells, & Wellman, 2008). Although both middle-
aged adults and their adult offspring may be familiar with
technological devices, young adults are more likely than
their parents to use cutting edge technologies (Smith, 2010).
Therefore, they may provide valuable information about
new computer programs or selecting electronic equipment.
Discrepancies in Reports of Support by Offspring and
Parents
Assessing both parties' perspectives regarding exchanges
may contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of
intergenerational support. Many studies of intergenerational
exchanges have relied on the child's or the parent's report
(See a review by Bianchi, Evans, Hotz, McGarry, & Seltzer,
2007). The few studies that have examined dyads, including
middle-aged offspring and older parents, have found that
parents report receiving less support than offspring report
giving (Kim, Zarit, Eggebeen, Birditt, & Fingerman, 2011).
Parents' minimization of offspring support may reflect
self-enhancement, that is, the tendency to describe one's
actions more positively than others perceive those actions
(Krueger, 1998). According to Erikson's (1950) lifespan
theory, middle-aged parents seek generativity and desire to
give to future generations. Thus, parents may perceive them-
selves as providers rather than receivers of support and report
receiving less support than young adults report providing.
Why Do Young Adults Provide Support to Parents?
This study applied three perspectives from literature
regarding middle-aged offspring and aging parents to help
understand why young adults may provide support to their
parents. Factors that may explain offspring support include
the following: (a) parental needs (Katz et al., 2010), (b)
close intergenerational ties (Schwarz et al., 2005), and (c)
reciprocation of support offspring receive from parents
(Silverstein et al., 2002).
Offspring support and parental needs.--Children of any
age may respond to parental needs (Eggebeen & Davey,
1998; Ha, Hong, Seltzer, & Greenberg, 2008). Contingency
theory in sociology and altruism theory in economics (Kohli
& Künemund, 2003; Becker, 1974) predict that offspring
step in to assist when parents incur problems, such as health
difficulties, functional limitations, or financial crises (Katz
et al., 2010; McGarry & Schoeni, 1997).
In young adulthood, offspring may provide help to par-
ents when they have dire needs. Although older adults often
encounter health problems (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2010), middle-aged adults can also experience
significant health challenges that require temporary or long-
term assistance. Indeed, prior studies suggest that young
adult offspring assist as caregivers when parents suffer cri-
ses, such as depression, early onset dementia, and cancer
(Ha et al., 2008; Shifren, 2001). Additionally, middle-aged
parents may experience personal problems, such as finan-
cial crises or relationship troubles, which may elicit various
types of everyday support from young adult offspring.
Offspring support and close intergenerational ties.--
Solidarity theory suggests that support exchanges occur
in relationships characterized by positive sentiments and
high relationship quality (Bengtson, Giarrusso, Mabry, &
Silverstein, 2002). These patterns have been documented in
late life; middle-aged adults provide more support to par-
ents when they have better quality relationships (Schwarz
et al., 2005).
Similarly, in young adulthood, high-quality relationships
may present opportunities for offspring to provide support
to their parents. In the context of positive quality relation-
ships, young adults may offer emotional support, lend an
attentive ear, help with chores and special projects, serve as
a companion for mutually enjoyable activities, share infor-
mation about the latest technologies, and provide advice.
Offspring support and reciprocity of support.--Offspring
may also respond to the parental support they receive by
providing help in return. Life-span reciprocity theory sug-
gests that offspring repay parents for support in early life
by providing them with support in old age (Antonucci &
Jackson, 1990). For example, emotional support that parents
provided to young adult children explained children's pro-
pensity to support aging parents 26 years later (Silverstein
et al., 2002). This reciprocity may begin earlier with young
adults providing support in response to what they receive,
before parents require help. In a European sample, Grundy
(2005) found that both older and middle-aged parents who
provided more practical and financial support received
more practical and financial assistance from adult offspring.
Thus, young adult offspring may provide greater support
when they receive more parental assistance.
Other Factors Explaining Young Adults'Support of
Parents
We controlled for other variables that may be associated
with the amount of support that young adults provide their
parents. Offspring's life course statuses contribute to patterns
408
YOUNG ADULTS'SUPPORT
of support (Bucx et al., 2012). Specifically, students may pro-
vide more support than nonstudents (Attias-Donfut & Wolff,
2000). By contrast, married offspring may give less support
to parents than unmarried offspring (Sarkisian & Gerstel,
2008). Offspring who have children themselves were less
likely to provide financial support to their parents than off-
spring without children, after controlling for offspring's age
and coresidence with parents (Bucx et al., 2012).
We also controlled for offspring's race, gender, and
age. Studies have documented different support pat-
terns between Black and White middle-aged offspring
(Fingerman, VanderDrift, Dotterer, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011).
Daughters generally provide more support to parents than
sons (Raley & Bianchi, 2006). Moreover, older offspring
typically provide more support to parents than younger off-
spring (Litwin, Vogel, Künemund, & Kohli, 2008).
In addition, we controlled for characteristics of middle-
aged parents, which may also be associated with the amount
of offspring support including gender, marital status, fam-
ily size, education, and geographical proximity between
parents and adult children. Studies have found that moth-
ers receive more support than fathers, and married parents
receive more support from offspring than divorced parents
(Grundy, 2005). In a European study of 10 nations, grown
children who had more siblings (i.e., larger families) pro-
vided less practical support to parents (Bonsang, 2007).
Parents with higher education also received less help from
offspring (Bucx et al., 2012). Finally, geographical proxim-
ity allows parties to provide practical support (Lowenstein,
Katz, & Gur-Yaish, 2007); however, other forms of support
may transcend geographical distances.
In sum, we assessed support that young adults provide
to their middle-aged parents. We predicted that offspring
provide listening, companionship, advice, emotional,
and technological support frequently but give less practi-
cal and financial support. Additionally, we compared off-
spring's and parents' perspectives and expected offspring
to report giving more support than parents reported receiv-
ing. Drawing on contingency theory, we predicted offspring
would provide more support to parents when parents have
greater needs (i.e., disability, personal problems). Based
on solidarity and reciprocity theory, we also predicted off-
spring would provide more support when they had better
quality relationships with parents and when they received
more support from parents.
Method
Sample
The sample was from the Family Exchanges Study (FES;
Fingerman et al., 2011) conducted in 2008. Parents from the
Philadelphia Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area were ini-
tially recruited using random digit dialing within regional area
codes as well as purchased lists from Genyses Corporation.
Parents.--The FES recruited 633 parents, aged
40­60 years, who had at least one child over 18 years old.
The response rate for eligible parents was 75%, which is
comparable to similar studies (Grundy, 2005; Silverstein
et al., 2002; Suitor, Gilligan, & Pillemer, 2013).
For the parent sample in this study, we utilized data from
364 parents who had at least one young adult child who
also participated in this study. FES oversampled areas with
high ethnic minority representation. In comparison to the
U.S. population, the parents in this study included a higher
proportion of African American adults and were slightly
higher in educational attainment and income (U.S. Census
Bureau, 2008). As shown in Table 1, parents had an aver-
age income of $40,001­$75,000; 52% of the parents are
women, 26% African American, and 65% married.
Adult offspring.--At the end of the interviews with
parents, we requested contact information for up to three
grown children, aged 18 years or older. The majority of
parents (88%) had three or fewer children; we asked for
information regarding each of their children. For the 12% of
parents who had more than three grown children, we asked
about the grown child who received the most support, the
least support, and a randomly selected other child.
We obtained contact information of offspring from 63%
of the 633 parents in the sample. We interviewed 75% of the
offspring with contact information (N = 592, aged 18­45).
The response rate for offspring was higher than studies
recruiting middle-aged children from aging parents (Suitor
et al., 2013).
To focus on young adults, we further limited the sam-
ple to offspring aged 18­30 (n = 515). Among offspring,
54% were women; 22% were African American; 10% were
multiracial; 10% were married; 16% had children; and
40% were full-time students (See Table 1). The 515 young
adult offspring in this study were recruited from 364 par-
ents/families where 18 (5%) families had 3 offspring who
participated, 115 (32%) families had 2 offspring, and 231
(63%) families had 1 offspring who participated. Based
on data from the parents' interviews, we conducted t tests
comparing offspring aged 18­30 who participated and off-
spring aged 18­30 who did not participate in the interviews.
Grown children in this study were younger, perceived as
less healthy, and more likely to be White, women, and stu-
dents compared with young adult offspring who did not
participate. Parents also reported better relationship quality
and more frequent support from their participating young
adult offspring.
Procedure
Most parents and offspring completed the survey via
Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). Offspring
also had the option of a web-based survey. In this study,
86% of the offspring completed the survey by phone and
409
CHENG ET AL.
14% completed it via the web-based option. Compared with
offspring who completed the phone interview, offspring
who completed the web-based survey were more likely
to be White (t = -4.85, p < .001), but no other differences
were evident in demographic characteristics or patterns of
support. Each participant received $30 compensation for
completing the survey. The phone interview lasted approxi-
mately 45
min, and the web-survey took approximately
30min.
Offspring answered questions regarding themselves and
each living parent. Thus, offspring provided information
about the parent who did not participate in the study as
well as the parent who did. The majority of offspring (97%,
n = 498) reported on two parents.
Measures
Intergenerational support index.--Participants com-
pleted the Intergenerational Support Index (ISI; Fingerman,
Cheng, Cichy, Birditt, & Zarit, 2013). The ISI assessed six
types of support including (a) listening to talk about daily
life, (b) emotional support, (c) companionship, (d) advice,
(e) practical, and (f) financial support. We also included an
additional type of support, technological support (Boase,
Horrigan, Wellman, & Rainie, 2006). Offspring reported
the frequency with which they provided each type of sup-
port to their mother and father separately rated: 1 = less
than once a year or never, 2 = once a year, 3 = a few times
a year, 4 = monthly, 5 = a few times a month, 6 = weekly,
7 = a few times a week, and 8 = daily. Parents completed
the same items regarding support received from each child.
For the research question regarding support, the mean of
seven items served as a summary score; for the offspring
report,  = .83; for the parent report,  = .80. We also con-
sidered the frequency of each type of support separately.
Parental needs.--Parental needs were assessed with
items measuring parental problems and disability. Offspring
completed the Life Problems Scales (Birditt, Fingerman, &
Zarit, 2010), indicating whether parents experienced eight
types of problems in the past 2 years: physical, emotional/
psychological, drug/drinking or financial problems, death
of people they felt close to, victim of a crime, divorce/
relationship problems, or other problems. Each problem
was coded 1 or 0 and summed into a total score. Offspring
reported whether each parent was physically disabled,
coded as 0 = not disabled or 1 = disabled.
Close intergenerational ties.--Participants responded
to two widely used items regarding positive qualities of
relationship: (a) how much they felt loved and cared for
(Umberson, 1992) and (b) how much they felt understood
by the other (Fingerman, Cheng, Birditt, & Zarit, 2011);
rated 1 = not at all to 5 = a great deal. For offspring reports,
 = .57; for parent reports,  = .63.
Reciprocity of support.--Offspring and parents reported
how much support the parent provided to offspring using
the same ISI items.
Control variables.--We controlled for variables poten-
tially associated with support. Offspring gender was

coded: 0 = women or 1 = men. We also coded offspring
statuses dichotomously: (a) student status: 0 = not student
or 1 = student; (b) parental status: 0 = no child or 1 = have
children; and (c) marital status: 0 = other or 1 = married or

Family size was coded as the number of children parents
have. Parents reported the number of years of education
they completed. Consistent with other studies, we coded
offspring geographical proximity to parent as 0 = 50 miles
or closer or 1 = 51 miles or more (Merolla, 2010).
Analysis Strategy
Analyses treated parents' and offspring's reports sepa-
rately. The initial analyses focused on descriptive statistics
pertaining to support that offspring provide parents. The
support measure relied on an ordinal scale that has been
used in other studies (Bucx et al., 2012; Lin & Yi, 2011;
Silverstein, Gans, & Yang 2006). Some previous studies
have measured intergenerational support by asking about
support over the last month (Bonsang, 2007; Eggebeen,
2005). For descriptive purposes, we present the proportions
of parents and offspring who reported each type of support
at least once a month, with each type of support recoded
as 1 (at least once a month) or 0 (less than once a month).
For hypothesis testing analyses, we treated the support
measure as continuous, which is typical in research using
temporal scales for support (Silverstein et al., 2002; Lin &
Yi, 2011). We examined factors associated with offspring
support. To do so, we used multilevel analysis with the
PROC Mixed function in SAS (Littell, Milliken, Stroup, &
Wolfinger, 1996; Singer, 1998). PROC Mixed allowed us to
consider multiple offspring nested within families, shared
variance of offspring in the same family (i.e., reports about
offspring in the same family), variance between families,
and unbalanced data (i.e., unequal number of family mem-
bers). We used pairwise deletion for missing data (rates of
missing data were minimal < 2%).
To assure that the treatment of support as a continuous
outcome did not distort findings, we also estimated the
models treating each type of support as a dichotomous out-
come with 1 (at least monthly support) or 0 (less than once
a month). We used the PROC Glimmix function in SAS,
which estimates multilevel models with binary outcomes.
The patterns of findings were nearly identical. For ease
in interpretation, we present findings from the continuous
outcome.
Predicting offspring reports.--For offspring reports,
515 offspring reported on 1,013 parents. These offspring
were nested within 364 families. We used a three-level
model structure throughout the analyses where the lower
level was the offspring's reports of 1,013 parents, the mid-
dle level was 515 offspring, and the upper level was 364
families.
Predicting parent reports.--For parents' reports, 364 par-
ents reported on 515 participating offspring. Because each
family had only one parent's report, two-level multilevel
models were used. The lower level was the parents' reports
on 515 offspring, and the upper level was the 364 families.
We estimated three multilevel models to examine rea-
sons for offspring support: (a) parental need (problems and
disability status), (b) offspring's relationship quality with
parents, and (c) support parents provided to offspring. We
considered two types of dependent variables: (a) a compos-
ite measure of the average of the seven types of support, and
(b) each of the seven types of support examined separately.
Control variables included offspring's race, gender, age,
student status, marital status, and parental status as well as
parents' gender, marital status, family size, education, and
geographical distance between parents and offspring.
We did not test the differences of coefficients predict-
ing offspring support between parents' and offspring's
reports because offspring's reports involved 3-level models,
whereas parents' reports involved 2-level models. Similarly,
we did not test the differences of coefficients predicting
offspring support across types of support because types
of support were dependent variables in different statistical
models. Moreover, for models testing reciprocity of support
between offspring and parents, we did not include compan-
ionship because providing and receiving companionship
usually indicates being together for the same activities.
Results
Descriptive Statistics and Discrepancies in Offspring's
and Parents'Reports of Support
We first considered descriptive information regarding
types of support. Figure 1 shows the percentages of off-
spring providing support at least once a month. A large pro-
portion of offspring and parents reported listening to parents
talk about daily life at least monthly (88% from offspring
reports; 90% from parent reports), whereas only 18% of
offspring and 11% of parents reported that offspring pro-
vided financial support at least monthly. Contrary to expec-
tations, only 53% of offspring and 38% of parents reported
technological support from offspring at least monthly.
We also compared parents' and offspring's reports of
offspring support. As expected, paired t-tests revealed that
offspring reported providing emotional support (t = 3.81),
advice (t = 4.36), practical (t = 8.13), technological
(t = 7.08), and financial support (t = 5.12), more frequently
than parents reported receiving these types of support
(ps < .001). Offspring's and parents' reports did not differ
for listening or companionship.
Why Do Children Provide Support to Parents?
Next, we considered factors that may explain support
young adults provide to parents. We tested parental needs,
411
CHENG ET AL.
close intergenerational ties, and reciprocity of support in
separate models.
Parental needs.--As can be seen in Table 2, consistent
with predictions, young adults reported providing more
overall support (average support across all types) to par-
ents who had a disability. We estimated this model for each
type of support separately (See Supplementary Table 1).
Offspring reported giving more money to parents who
experienced personal problems. They also provided more
practical, technical, and financial support when parents
were disabled.
On the other hand, with parents' reports (Table 2), we did
not find an association between parents' personal problems/
disability and offspring support. This pattern was the same
for each type of support (See Supplementary Table 1).
Close intergenerational ties.--We then examined
whether offspring provide more support when they have
better quality relations with parents (See Table 2). For off-
spring's reports, having a more positive relationship was
associated with offspring giving more overall support as
well as each type of support, except financial support (See
Supplementary Table 2). For parents' reports, too, having a
better relationship was also associated with greater overall
support and more of each type of support from offspring.
Reciprocity of support.--Table 2 also includes findings
from a model with parental support of offspring as the inde-
pendent variable. Offspring who reported receiving more
support from parents provided more overall support to par-
ents and more of each type of support, except technologi-
cal support. Parents reported receiving more overall support
and more of each type of support when they provided off-
spring with more support (See Supplementary Table 3).
Discussion
This study examined intergenerational support from
young adults to their middle-aged parents. Overall, we
found that patterns of support evident in middle and older
adulthood may originate in earlier adulthood. Consistent
with solidarity theory (Schwarz et al., 2005; Silverstein
et al., 2002), young adults provided more support to par-
ents when they had better quality relations and when they
received more support from their parents. However, unlike
support patterns in late life (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Katz
et al., 2010), parental needs were not as salient a predictor
of offspring support during young adulthood, particularly
from the parents' perspective.
We also found that middle-aged parents reported receiv-
ing less support than young adult offspring reported provid-
ing, which is consistent with studies of parents and offspring
in later life (Kim et al., 2011). This finding may have impli-
cations for each party's well-being. In the United States,
young adults who report giving support are associated with
higher levels of positive mood (Gleason, Iida, Bolger, &
Shrout, 2003), whereas older adults receiving support from
offspring report worse psychological outcomes (Thomas,
2010). Thus, differences in parents' and offspring's reports
may be important for their well-being.
Types of Support Young Adult Offspring Provide Parents
Young adult offspring provided multiple types of support
to parents. As expected, a high proportion of parents and
offspring reported lending a listening ear and offering emo-
tional support. Providing money to parents, however, was
less frequent. These findings may reflect the characteristics
of emerging adulthood. During encounters in which parents
provide support (Fingerman, Cheng, Tighe, Birditt, & Zarit,
2012), young adults may have opportunities to reciprocate
Figure 1. Percent of parents and offspring reporting offspring support at least once a month for each type of support.

YOUNG ADULTS'SUPPORT
with nontangible support, such as listening or companion-
ship. Meanwhile, the paucity of monetary support may
reflect a dearth of material resources in emerging adulthood
(Arnett, 2007; Bucx et al., 2012).
We expected technological support to be frequent
because young adults are likely to use the latest technolo-
gies (Charness, Fox, & Mitchum, 2011), but only around
half of the offspring provided such assistance at least once
a month. Parents may not need technological support, such
as suggestions about computer programs, on a weekly or
daily basis. This is not to say that technology plays no role
in support between parents and offspring. For example,
cell phones or social networking programs may facilitate
parents and offspring to provide other types of support.
However, new technological devices that facilitate com-
munication may also increase distractions when parents
socialize with offspring. Given the complexity of today's
technological developments, future studies should examine
the role of different aspects of technological use and sup-
port in intergenerational ties.
This study also suggests that support patterns in later life
may have roots in young adulthood. Silverstein and col-
leagues (2002) found that when parents and young adult off-
spring spent more time together (e.g., having conversations,
talking about important matters, having dinner together),
offspring provided up to five types of support to their par-
ents 26 years later. Our study further indicated that young
adults also may reciprocate parental support concurrently.
Furthermore, young adults who spend more time with their
parents (e.g., listening, companionship, advice, and emo-
tional support) may set up a future pattern of support to
parents.
This pattern also may be evident with regard to caregiv-
ers in late life. Family systems theory emphasizes that
the family members' shared values about family tend to
shape behaviors over time (Fingerman & Bermann, 2000).
Empirical research has found that older mothers prefer the
same offspring to be their caregivers across time, especially
those who provided expressive or instrumental support to
them (Suitor et al., 2013). Therefore, young adults who pro-
vide more support to their middle-aged parents may provide
caregiving in the future.

theory suggests that individuals wish to present themselves
in a positive light that fits social norms (Krueger, 1998).
Middle-aged parents may report receiving less because of
the desire to view themselves as providers of support rather
than recipients (Marks & Greenfield, 2009). This tendency
is consistent with Erikson's (1950) lifespan theory regard-
ing generativity in midlife.Young adults may also engage in
self-enhancement by believing they provide more to parents
to compensate for receiving a lot of support from parents.
Reasons Why Grown Children Provide Support
Reasons underlying young adults' support of parents
were consistent with theoretical perspectives explaining
why offspring provide support later in middle adulthood.
Furthermore, both offspring's and parents' reports showed
that factors regarding solidarity and reciprocity theory were
associated with young adult offspring's support to parents.
Parental needs.--Young adults reported providing finan-
cial support rarely, but they did provide monetary support
when parents experience personal problems. Offspring
reported responding to personal problems, including
divorce and relationship crises. These findings contrast
with past findings that parental crises, such as divorce dur-
ing childhood, are not associated with support provided by
grown biological offspring (Aquilino, 1994). It is possible
that young adults in more recent cohorts are more likely to
be in contact with their parents (Furstenberg, 2010), so that
parents who are undergoing a relationship problem may be
more accessible to them. In addition, the patterns observed
regarding parental divorce in childhood may reflect a loss
of relationship closeness between parent and child follow-
ing divorce; this may not be the case for young adults who
continue to have strong bonds with their parents.
We failed to find an association between parents' reports of
personal problems or disability and support from their adult
offspring. Parents who experience problems or disabilities
may receive support from other social partners so that ado-
lescents and young adult children may serve supplementary
roles, whereas other family members are primary supporters
(Levine et al., 2005). It is also possible that the support from
offspring to parents is invisible, which may promote parents'
adjustments to stressors (Bolger, Zuckerman, Kessler, 2000).
Close intergenerational ties.--The solidarity theory sug-
gests that positive quality relationships go hand-in-hand
with intergenerational support (Bengtson et al., 2002). In
this study, good relationships may be associated with more
time spent with parents when opportunities for support
occur, except for financial support.
Reciprocity of support.--Reciprocity of intergenera-
tional support was evident in offspring's and parents'
reports. In late life, middle-aged adults provide support to
aging parents who currently help or have helped them in
young adulthood (Eggebeen & Davey, 1998; Leopold &
Raab, 2011). Similarly, in young adulthood, intergenera-
tional exchanges may be bidirectional, with offspring pro-
viding support when they also receive support (Fingerman
et al., 2012).
Limitations and Future Directions
There are several limitations to this study. Although we
used a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse sample, the
offspring who participated tend to be those who had better
quality relationships and who exchanged more frequent sup-
port with their parents than their siblings who did not partici-
pate. This selection bias may reflect parental favoritism in
participation rates (Kalmijn, 2013; Suitor et al., 2013). Thus,
this study may have overestimated the amount of support the
average young adult child provides to parents.
This study used cross-sectional data and did not have
enough information to examine the differences between
the support from young adult and middle-aged offspring.
Therefore, we cannot empirically investigate offspring's
patterns of support over time. Additional studies are neces-
sary to compare support patterns across three generations
and to ascertain whether support patterns among young
adults carry over into late life.
In summary, this study suggests the endurance of family
relationships into the adult years, which go beyond affec-
tion or obligation to children and include ongoing mutual
engagement and support. In young adulthood, offspring
provided support to parents in repayment for parental
investment and within the context of high-quality relation-
ships, whereas parental needs may not be as a salient pre-
dictor of offspring support.
