Aim: The goal of this study was to investigate the
relation between specific anxiety disorders and
substance dependence, adjusting for potentially
confounding demographic factors (e.g. sex) and
comorbidity (e.g. alcohol dependence, major depres-
sion), among adults in the USA.
Methods: Data were drawn from the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a nationally representa-
tive population sample of the US adult population
aged 15­54. The temporal sequence of onset of
anxiety and substance dependence disorders was
examined.
Results: Substance dependence temporally precedes
several anxiety disorders, particularly panic disorder.
Specifically, a history of past substance dependence
predicts current panic disorder (odds ratio [OR] =
2.62, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29, 5.32),
social phobia (OR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.12, 2.41), and
agoraphobia (OR = 1.78, 95%CI = 1.08, 2.94). Con-
versely, in more than 50% of substance abuse disor-
der cases, in nearly 40% of post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD) cases, and in nearly 30% of general-
ized anxiety disorder (GAD) cases, the anxiety disor-
der has first onset. Similarly, a lifetime history of
social phobia, PTSD, or GAD significantly predicts
lifetime substance dependence (OR = 1.51 for social
phobia, 2.06 for PTSD, 1.45 for GAD).
Conclusion: For any particular anxiety disorder, a
diagnosis of substance abuse can occur prior to or
subsequent to an anxiety disorder. Nevertheless,
there is also evidence for the specificity of some asso-
ciations between anxiety and substance dependence
disorders; these are independent of the effects of sex
and other comorbid disorders, may be causal in
nature, and deserve particular attention in clinical
settings. The possibility that within a particular
anxiety disorder there are a variety of mechanisms of
association with various substances should be
addressed in future work.
Key words: anxiety disorders, comorbidity, depres-
sion, epidemiology, substance-related disorders.
SUBSTANCE DEPENDENCE IS a tremendous
global public health problem.1­4 Substance
dependence (i.e., dependence on illicit drugs) is asso-
ciated with occupational disability, increased risk of
depressive and psychotic disorders, social impair-
ment, incarceration, and physical health problems.5­7
The causes of drug dependence are not known,
though previous data suggest that risk factors may be
identifiable relatively early in life, even prior to the
initiation of use and abuse.
Previous research has focused on examining the
relation between depressive symptoms, antisocial,
oppositional, and disruptive behavior disorders,
which are thought to precede and predict onset of
substance dependence.8­11 Other factors, such as
familial history of mood, alcohol, and drug use
disorders, are also thought to contribute to the

risk of substance use,12­15 as do childhood abuse and
deviant peer affiliations.16,17 For instance, longitudi-
nal research has shown that deviant peer affiliations
are related to persistence and course of cannabis use
across the lifespan.18 Also, Merikangas (1998) has
demonstrated links between familial mood disorders
and substance dependence.19 The determining factors
that govern the shift from vulnerability to onset of
substance dependence remain unknown and there
are recent data suggesting an interaction between
genetic and environmental influences in comorbid
substance dependence and mood disorders.20
Cross-sectional studies of adults show strong links
between anxiety disorders and substance use disor-
ders.21,22 Longitudinal studies have also shown asso-
ciations between anxiety disorders early in life and
the subsequent onset of substance use, such as ciga-
rette smoking.23,24 While results of previous studies
consistently show links between anxiety disorders
and substance dependence, several questions about
the association between anxiety disorders and the
onset of substance dependence remain. First, it is not
clear whether the association between anxiety disor-
ders and substance dependence applies to any anxiety
disorder, or whether it is specific only to some anxiety
disorders. Second, it is not known whether the rela-
tion between anxiety disorders and substance depen-
dence persists independent of the effects of comorbid
depression and alcohol use disorders. Third, it has
not been investigated whether the onset of anxiety
disorders tends to precede the onset of substance
dependence, whether substance dependence occurs
prior to the onset of anxiety disorders in the general
population.
Against this background, the goal of the current
investigation is to examine the relation between
anxiety disorders and substance dependence among
adults in the community. First, the study will deter-
mine the cross-sectional association between anxiety
disorders and substance dependence (current and
lifetime) among adults in the community. Second,
the study will examine the relation between specific
anxiety disorders and the odds of substance depen-
dence, adjusting for the effects of depression and
alcohol dependence. Third, the study will examine
the relation between a history of anxiety disorders
(which are not current) and the odds of current sub-
stance dependence in order to identify patterns of the
temporal sequence of onset of anxiety disorders and
substance dependence. We hypothesized that anxiety
disorders would be associated with increased likeli-
hood of substance dependence, independent of the
effects of depression and alcohol use dependence. In
addition, we anticipated that the onset of anxiety
disorders would precede the onset of substance
dependence in the majority of cases.
METHODS
Sample
The National Comorbidity Survey is based on a
national probability sample (n = 5, 788) of individu-
als aged 15­54 in the non-institutionalized US
population.25 Fieldwork was carried out between Sep-
tember 1990 and February 1992. There was an 82.4%
response rate. The data were weighted for differential
probabilities of selection and non-response. A weight
was also used to adjust the sample to approximate the
cross-classification of the population distribution on
a range of sociodemographic characteristics. Weight-
ing and a full description of study methodology are
described in detail elsewhere.25,26
Diagnostic assessment
Psychiatric diagnoses were generated from a modified
version of the World Health Organization (WHO)
Composite International Diagnostic Interview,27 a
structured interview designed for use by trained inter-
viewers who are not clinicians. WHO field trials
(WHO 1990) and National Comorbidity Survey
clinical reappraisal studies28­30 documented accept-
able reliability and validity of all the diagnoses.
Psychiatric disorders included in the current investi-
gation were DSM-III-R major depression, generalized
anxiety disorder (GAD), simple phobia, social
phobia, panic attacks, panic disorder, post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), alcohol dependence, and sub-
stance (illicit drug) dependence. Written informed
consent was obtained from each participant after the
survey had been fully explained.
Analytic strategy
Logistic regression analyses were used to investigate
the association between anxiety disorders and sub-
stance dependence (past 12-month and lifetime).
First, analyses were adjusted for differences in socio-
demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, marital
status, income, education). Next, sociodemographic
characteristics and comorbid alcohol dependence

and major depression were included in the model.
The same procedure was used to examine the asso-
ciation between history of anxiety disorders (having
lifetime anxiety disorders, but not current) and
current drug dependence, and between history of
drug dependence and current anxiety disorders.
Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals
were computed.
RESULTS
Association between anxiety disorders and
substance dependence
Association between lifetime anxiety disorders
and lifetime drug dependence
Each anxiety disorder was associated with a signifi-
cantly increased likelihood of drug dependence,
which persisted after adjusting for differences in
sociodemographic characteristics, alcohol depen-
dence and major depression (see Table 1).
Sequence of onset of drug dependence and
anxiety disorders
Onset of substance dependence occurred sequentially
prior to the onset of anxiety disorder in a majority of
cases among those with panic attacks, agoraphobia,
GAD, and PTSD (see Table 2). Among those with
specific phobia and drug dependence, there seemed
almost an equal distribution of first onset, and social
phobia appeared to have onset prior to drug depen-
dence in the majority of cases. In more than 50% of
social phobia cases, in nearly 40% of PTSD cases, and
in nearly 30% of GAD cases, the onset of the anxiety
disorder was first.
Association between history of anxiety
disorders and current drug dependence
History of each anxiety disorder, with the exception
of panic disorder, was associated with a significantly

increased likelihood of current drug dependence (see
Table 3). After further adjustment for alcohol depen-
dence, only the links with panic attacks and PTSD
remained. Although the pattern of results remained
the same, with additional adjustment for comorbid
major depression, only the link between history of
agoraphobia and substance dependence remained
statistically significant.
Association between history of drug
dependence and current anxiety disorders
History of drug dependence was associated with a
significantly increased likelihood of current panic
attacks, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and social
phobia (see Table 4). These associations persisted
after adjusting for demographic characteristics,
alcohol dependence and major depression. The
association was strongest for panic disorder. History
of drug dependence did not appear to be associated
with increased likelihood of specific phobia or
GAD.
DISCUSSION
The community data here confirm clinical impres-
sions and previous findings that the relationship
between anxiety disorders and substance dependence
are complex. These results suggest that for any par-
ticular anxiety disorder, comorbid substance use
disorders may have an earlier onset and possibly con-
tribute to the pathogenesis of anxiety symptoms, or
comorbid substance dependence can have a later
onset perhaps reflecting the outcome of behaviors
associated with an attempt to self-medicate anxiety
symptoms. The data here also provide evidence
for: (i) strong lifetime associations between specific
anxiety disorders and substance dependence among
adults in the community; (ii) the possibility that
associations between specific disorders are indepen-
dent of the influence of demographic characteristics
and comorbid major depression and alcohol depen-
dence; and (iii) the specificity of associations
between particular anxiety disorders and substance
dependence.

By controlling for the effects of sex and comorbid
disorders we were able to demonstrate that the asso-
ciation between anxiety and substance dependence is
not simply a methodological artifact. While there is
growing awareness amongst clinicians of obtaining
an alcohol history in all patients with anxiety disor-
ders, and of determining a history of mood and
anxiety disorders in all patients with alcohol depen-
dence, there is perhaps less focus on other substances
in clinical assessment of patients presenting with
anxiety disorders. Substance abuse and dependence
are stigmatized conditions, and may be underre-
ported especially upon initial presentation as well as
being overshadowed by more clinically obvious
comorbid mood symptoms. As such, this may con-
tribute to the relative underdiagnosis and undertreat-
ment of anxiety disorders among persons with
comorbid substance dependence, despite its preva-
lence. In fact, reviewing literature on treatment of
patients with comorbid anxiety and substance use
disorders shows that there is relatively little evidence
of specific treatments for both disorders.
The strongest association between past substance
dependence and current anxiety disorder was
observed in panic disorder. This finding is consistent
with the frequent observation that panic disorder can
be precipitated or exacerbated by substance use or
withdrawal.31­33 It is also consistent with current
understandings of the neurobiology of panic attacks.
This theory suggests that panic attacks are under-
pinned by a distributed neurocircuitry involving the
amygdala that may be sensitized or activated by a
range of different stressors, including changes in
either the external or internal milieu.34,35 While data
here cannot be used as evidence to confirm this
pathway, these results may be useful in pointing to
patterns of specificity that may be fruitfully investi-
gated in future, more detailed, studies.
Results also showed associations between past sub-
stance dependence and other current anxiety disor-
ders, such as social phobia. Withdrawal from regular
social activities is commonly seen among individuals
who spend significant amounts of their time and
effort on drug seeking and drug taking. There may
also be more direct relations between substance
abuse and social anxiety; for example, withdrawal of
a range of substances leads to decreased levels of
striatal D2 receptors, a finding that is also seen in
social anxiety disorder patients.36,37 Speculatively,
there may be overlaps between the neurobiological
sequelae of substance use or withdrawal, and the
neural substrate of social anxiety. In addition, it is
conceivable that use of substances may begin as an
attempt to self-medicate feelings of isolation and dis-
tress related to lack of social relationships associated
with social anxiety.38,39 While only a minority of
instances of substance use lead to the development of
dependence, it has been shown that social phobia is
associated with increased risk of development of sub-
stance dependence, once substance use is initiated.
For instance, one study40 showed very high rates of
nicotine dependence among those with social phobia
who initiated nicotine use (31.5%), compared with
rates of nicotine dependence among those without
social phobia (15.4%). As such, it may be that expo-
sure to some substances and learning (through expo-
sure) of the anxiety-relieving effects may lead to the
onset of substance use among those with social
phobia.
Our findings also indicate that anxiety disorders
may contribute to the onset of substance depen-
dence. While the cross-sectional nature of these data
and lack of more detailed information on factors
influencing onset do not permit conclusions based
on these data alone, the persistence of these associa-
tions after adjusting for differences in comorbid
depression and alcohol use disorders suggest that the
link is not purely attributable to comorbidity. This is
consistent with growing evidence emphasizing the
relatively early onset of anxiety disorders and associ-
ated vulnerability to later comorbid disorders. In
more than 50% of social phobia cases, in nearly 40%
of PTSD cases, and in nearly 30% of GAD cases,
anxiety disorders had first onset. Similarly, a lifetime
history of social phobia, PTSD, or GAD significantly
predicted lifetime substance dependence, an associa-
tion that was strongest for PTSD. Furthermore, the
greater the number of lifetime anxiety disorders, the
higher the risk for past and for current substance
dependence.
Several limitations of this study should be empha-
sized. First, as noted above, the cross-sectional nature
of the dataset does not allow inferences about the
causality or mechanisms of these observed associa-
tions. Second, participants were aged 15­54 only,
therefore these results are not generalizable to other
age groups. Third, we were unable to analyze the data
according to specific type of substance with confi-
dence (mainly due to small cell size; e.g. benzodiaz-
epines); future work needs to explore also the specific
relations between specific substance use disorders
and the range of anxiety disorders. Replication in a

larger national dataset, such as the National Epide-
miologic Study on Alcohol and Related Conditions
(NESARC), may be informative. Fourth, while these
results are generalizable to the USA, they may not be
relevant to other countries.
Nevertheless, these data provide preliminary evi-
dence on the potential significance in emphasizing
specific associations between particular anxiety disor-
ders and substance dependence. These findings have
clear clinical implications, including the need to
maintain a reasonable level of suspicion for anxiety
disorders in patients with substance use disorders,
and the need for early detection and robust interven-
tion for anxiety disorders in order to help prevent
subsequent morbidity. Further research is needed to
investigate the precise mechanisms, which account
for the temporal relations apparent in this dataset,
and to extend the work to include the range of spe-
cific substance use disorders.
