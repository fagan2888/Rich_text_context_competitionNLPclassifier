Cancer Prevalence and
Survivorship Issues: Analyses
of the 1992 National Health
Interview Survey
Maria Hewitt, Nancy Breen, Susan
Devesa
Background/Methods: Relatively little
is known about the size and makeup of
the growing population of cancer sur-
vivors or about the social implications
of a diagnosis of cancer. To explore
these issues, we analyzed cancer survi-
vorship information from the 1992 Na-
tional Health Interview Survey (NHIS),
and resulting cancer prevalence esti-
mates were compared with those de-
rived from cancer registry data. Re-
sults: According to the NHIS, there
were an estimated 7.2 million adult
survivors of cancer--excluding non-
melanoma skin cancer--in 1992, repre-
senting 3.9% of the U.S. adult popula-
tion. Comparisons with prevalence
estimates from cancer registry data
suggest that cancer is underreported in
the NHIS. Nearly three fifths (58.0%)
of cancer survivors self-identified on
the NHIS reported that their cancer
was first detected when they noticed
something wrong and went to a doctor.
The majority (55.7%) of cancer survi-
vors had obtained a second opinion or
multiple opinions regarding their treat-
ment. Most (58.0%) had received pa-
tient educational materials from a
health care provider. However, rela-
tively few had received counseling or
participated in support groups
(14.2%), contacted cancer organiza-
tions after their diagnosis (10.9%), or
participated in a research study or
clinical trial as part of their cancer
treatment (4.7%). One ninth (10.7%) of
the survivors had been denied health or
life insurance coverage because of their
cancer. Nearly one fifth (18.2%) of the
cancer survivors who worked before or
after their cancer was diagnosed expe-
rienced employment problems because
of their cancer. Conclusions: While
cancer appears to be underreported on
the 1992 NHIS, the survey provides
valuable information about the medi-
cal, insurance, and employment experi-
ence of cancer survivors selected from
a nationally representative sample of
U.S. households. [J Natl Cancer Inst
1999;91:1480­6]
As more people seek effective cancer-
screening tests, have their cancer detected
early, and benefit from advances in cancer
treatment, the number of cancer survivors
can be expected to grow. Relatively little
is known about the size and makeup of
this population or about the medical care
experience of and social implications for
patients who have had a diagnosis of can-
cer. In 1992, a nationally representative
sample of individuals was interviewed as
part of the National Health Interview Sur-
vey (NHIS). Those reporting a diagnosis
of cancer at some time in their past were
asked about their experiences with cancer.
METHODS
Data Sources
The NHIS is a principal source of information on
the health of the U.S. noninstitutionalized, civilian
population (1). The NHIS is conducted by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD,
and provides national data on the incidence of illness
and accidental injuries, the prevalence of chronic
conditions and impairments, the extent of disability,
and the utilization of health care services. The 1992
NHIS included two cancer supplements, the Cancer
Control Supplement and the Cancer Epidemiology
Supplement, each of which included a Cancer Sur-
vivorship Section (2). In each of the 49 401 house-
holds selected for interviews, a sample adult respon-
dent (18 years old) was selected to complete the
cancer survivorship questions. Because of budgetary
constraints, cancer supplement interviews were
stopped during the third quarter of the field period,
with 24 040 NHIS respondents having completed the
Cancer Survivorship Section. The overall response
rates for the Cancer Control and Cancer Epidemiol-
ogy Supplements were 87% and 86%, respectively.
For purposes of the NHIS, cancer survivors in-
clude respondents who reported ever having a diag-
nosis of cancer, regardless of whether they currently
had symptoms of cancer. A total of 1553 respon-
dents reported that a doctor had told them that they
had cancer. These respondents were asked how
many different kinds of cancer they had had, the
types of cancer they had, when the first cancer was
diagnosed and at what age, and how the cancer was
first detected. When more than one cancer had been
diagnosed, information on the most recently diag-
nosed cancer was also reported (i.e., type of cancer,
year of diagnosis, and age at diagnosis). A total of
1519 respondents (98%) identified the kind of can-
cer they had. Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer,
there were 1020 cancer survivors identified. Of
these, 656 individuals had been diagnosed with can-
cer in the last 10 years (either a primary or a sub-
sequent cancer) and were asked to provide informa-
tion on their experiences around the time of
diagnosis and whether they had subsequent prob-
lems with insurance coverage and employment.
For the assessment of the validity of survey-
reported cancer prevalence, national estimates of
cancer prevalence were calculated on the basis of
Connecticut Tumor Registry prevalence rates, age
adjusted by sex to the 1992 U.S. population with the
use of NHIS weights (adults only). In existence
since 1935, the Connecticut Tumor Registry is the
oldest population-based cancer registry in the United
States and has sufficient length of follow-up of re-
ported cases to generate accurate prevalence esti-
mates (3). To make the registry-based estimates
comparable to self-reported cancers, we included in
situ diseases of the breast and cervix in the preva-
lence estimates [special tabulations prepared by
David Annett, Information Management Services,
Silver Spring, MD, October 1998; (3)].
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics and logistic-regression mod-
els are presented to assess whether cancer survivors'
characteristics are associated with six dichotomous
outcomes of interest: receipt of a second opinion,
receipt of counseling/participation in a support
group, receipt of patient educational materials, con-
tact with cancer organizations, participation in clini-
cal research, and cancer-related problems in em-
ployment. The NHIS has a complex survey design
involving stratification, clustering, and dispropor-
tionate sampling. All proportions and population
counts presented are weighted to provide national
estimates. Variance estimates for proportions and
logistic-regression model odds ratios (ORs) were
calculated by use of the Taylor series approximation
technique, taking into account the complex design of
the survey [Stata Statistical Software (4)]. All P val-
ues are two-sided; if less than .05, they are consid-
ered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Prevalence of Self-Reported Cancer
In 1992, an estimated 11 million
Americans, or 6.1% of the total adult
population, had ever had cancer according
to the NHIS. If skin cancers other than
melanoma are excluded, there were an es-
timated 7.2 million Americans with a his-
tory of a cancer diagnosis, representing
3.9% of the U.S. population (Table 1, A).
Comparisons of NHIS and cancer reg-
istry prevalence estimates suggest that
cancer was underreported in the NHIS
and that men were less likely than women
to report cancer (Table 1, B). For men, the
survey's estimate of overall cancer preva-
lence was 20.2% lower than the cancer

registry estimate; in contrast, for women,
the degree of underreporting was only
2.9%. The NHIS prevalence estimates ap-
pear to be especially low for cancers of
the larynx, trachea, bronchus, and lung
among men (54.0% lower than cancer
registry estimates) and for colorectal can-
cer among both men and women (40.3%
and 36.8% lower, respectively) (Table 1,
B). Female genital cancers are slightly
overrepresented by self-report; survey esti-
mates were 5.7% higher than registry data.
Characteristics of Cancer Survivors
According to the 1992 NHIS, the lead-
ing types of self-reported cancer among
all cancer survivors are female reproduc-
tive cancers (e.g., uterine, including cer-
vical) (27.8%), female breast cancer
(20.4%), prostate and male reproductive
organ cancers (9.5%), and colorectal can-
cer (9.1%) (Table 2). Cancer survivors are
predominantly women (69.8%), and
nearly half (46.2%) are 65 years old or
older. More than three quarters (76.4%)
of cancer survivors were first diagnosed
with cancer at age 35 years or older; the
majority (52.4%) were diagnosed at ages
35­64 years. Most cancer survivors
(63.3%) have lived 5 or more years fol-
lowing their diagnosis, and nearly one
tenth (9.9%) have survived for more than
25 years. Racial and ethnic minority
groups are underrepresented among can-
cer survivors (11.7% of those with a his-
tory of cancer versus 22.6% of those with-
out a history of cancer are Hispanic,
Black, or other race). This result suggests
poorer survival but could also be related
to differential reporting or variation in in-
cidence rates. More than one third
(36.5%) of cancer survivors rate their
health as excellent or very good. Fewer
than one third (32.2%) of survivors rate
their health as fair or poor.
Detection of Initial Cancer
Most individuals reporting cancer
(58.0%) said that their cancer was first
detected when they noticed something
wrong and went to a doctor. Nearly one
third (29.8%) had no symptoms and had
the cancer detected during a routine
checkup. The remaining 12.2% had their
cancer detected in some other way. Can-
cers for which there are effective screen-
ing tests should be more likely to be de-

International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9), codes for cancers are as follows: skin, melanoma (172); cervix, uterus, other female genital organs
(179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184); female breast (174); prostate, testes, other male genital organs (185, 186, 187); colorectal (153, 154); leukemia, Hodgkin's disease
(201, 202, 203, 208); larynx, trachea, bronchus, lung (161, 162); and other reported specified site (140, 142, 145, 149, 150, 151, 152, 156, 157, 159, 170, 171, 188,
189, 190, 191, 193, 195, 196, 199) (17). When multiple cancers were reported, type of cancer refers to the first cancer diagnosed. ICD-9 codes not listed were not
reported on the NHIS.
National estimates of cancer prevalence are based on Connecticut Tumor Registry rates, age adjusted by sex to the 1992 U.S. population with the use of NHIS
weights, adults only. For comparability with self-reported cancers, in situ diseases of the breast and cervix were included. Registry-based site- or type-specific
prevalence rates do not add to the total because, when multiple cancers were reported, each was included in site- or type-specific prevalence rates.

tected through routine checkups than
cancers without such tests. This appeared
to be the case for cancers of the breast,
cervix, and prostate but not for colorectal
cancer.
Frequency of Second Opinion About
Type of Treatment1
More than half (55.7%) of the
individuals with cancer reported ob-
taining a second or multiple opinions re-
garding their treatment (Table 3).
According to multivariate analyses,
characteristics associated with a sta-
tistically significant greater use of se-
cond opinion include the following
(Table 4):
· Hispanic origin (relative to white, non-
Hispanic) (OR  2.8; 95% confidence
interval [CI]  1.0­7.8; P  .049);
· breast cancer (relative to "other can-
cers") (OR  2.1; 95% CI  1.2­3.7);
and
· residence in a noncentral city Metro-
politan Statistical Area (MSA)2 (rela-
tive to non-MSAs) (OR  1.9 [95% CI
 1.1­3.0].
Residents of the Northeast had a sta-
tistically significant lower use of second
opinions (OR  0.5; 95% CI  0.3­0.9).
Very few (13.1%) individuals with
cancer reported seeing only their internist
or general practitioner for their diagnosis
and treatment.
Receipt of Counseling or Participation
in Support Group
Relatively few persons (14.2%) re-
ported receiving counseling or joining a
support group following their diagnosis
(Table 3). Among those who did not re-
ceive counseling, most (64.1%) felt that
they did not need it, 11.8% did not want
it, and 9.4% did not know that it was
available. Another 14.7% said that they
did not get counseling for some other rea-
son. Individuals with breast cancer were
statistically significantly more likely than
those with other cancers to have received
counseling or to have participated in a
support group (OR  2.4; 95% CI 
1.0­5.6; P  .047) (Table 4). Those di-
agnosed with cancer recently were more
than twice as likely than those diagnosed
5 or more years ago to have reported re-
ceiving counseling or joining a support
group (OR  2.6; 95% CI  1.4­4.7)
(Table 4).
Patient Education
More than half (58.0%) of those with
cancer reported having received written
information about their cancer or its treat-
ment from a doctor, nurse, or social
worker (Table 3). Another 7.0% did not
get written information from a provider
but did pick the materials up themselves.
Approximately one third of cancer survi-
vors (35.0%) reported not having received
written patient information materials. Ac-
cording to multivariate analyses, indi-
viduals with breast cancer relative to
those with other cancers (OR  2.5; 95%
CI  1.3­4.9) and those under age 65
years relative to older individuals (<35
years of age, OR  3.9 [95% CI  2.0­
7.6]; 35­64 years of age, OR  2.6 [95%
CI  1.5­4.4]) were more than twice as

nosed with cancer recently were more
likely than those diagnosed 5 or more

Almost everyone (93.6%) who ob-

· Cancer treatment options (36.3%)
· Coping with the physical side effects of
cancer treatment (37.4%)
· Coping with the emotional effects of
cancer (27.4%)
· Other topics (8.4%)
Contact With Cancer Organizations
Relatively few (10.9%) cancer survi-
vors reported having contacted cancer or-
ganizations, such as the National Cancer
Institute or the American Cancer Society,
after their diagnosis (Table 3). Women re-
porting cervical cancer compared with
those reporting other cancers were statis-
tically significantly less likely to have
made contact (OR  0.1; 95% CI  0.0­
0.5), according to multivariate analyses
(Table 4). Those diagnosed with cancer
recently were much more likely than
those diagnosed with cancer 5 or more
years ago to have made such contact (OR

Change in Health or Life Insurance
Coverage Because of Cancer
Roughly one in nine (10.7%) cancer
survivors reported having been denied
health or life insurance coverage because
of cancer. Relatively few individuals
(6.8%) with private health insurance that
paid for all or part of their cancer treat-
ment reported that their health insurance
changed because of cancer following their
diagnosis. Insurance cost increases were
reported by 4.9% of cancer survivors.
Very few (1.8%) reported that they were
asked to waive coverage of their cancer in
order to get health insurance.
Cancer-Related Problems With
Employment
Fewer than half (43.2%) of cancer sur-
vivors worked before their diagnosis was
made. Nearly one quarter (24.0%) of can-
cer survivors were 65 years old or older at
diagnosis, which may in part account for
this relatively low level of employment.
Individuals (n  291) who worked im-
mediately before or after their cancer was
diagnosed but who were not self-
employed were asked a series of ques-
tions about cancer-related employment
problems. Nearly one in five (18.2%) of
these cancer survivors reported at least
one of the following problems: felt that
they could not take a new job because of
a change in insurance related to cancer
(13.2%), felt that they could not change
jobs because of cancer (7.8%), faced on-
the-job problems from an employer or su-
pervisor directly related to their cancer
(4.5%), refrained from applying for a new
job because they did not want their medi-
cal records made public (4.4%), or were
fired or laid off from their job because of
their cancer (3.7%).
DISCUSSION
The 1992 NHIS estimate of cancer
prevalence among adults (3886 per
100000; 95% CI  3590­4182) was sta-
tistically significantly higher than an ear-
lier estimate from the 1987 NHIS (3230
per 100000; 95% CI  3054­3406) (5).
This growth in the share of the population
that has had experience with cancer could
be attributable to the aging of the popu-
lation, increased cancer detection, or im-
proved survival among patients with
some cancers.
Several factors could account for the
differences in survey- and registry-based
estimates of cancer prevalence. Some de-
gree of underascertainment of cancer by
survey is expected because the NHIS in-
cludes only the noninstitutional house-
hold population. Individuals seriously ill
with cancer might not be included in the
NHIS because they reside in hospices,
nursing homes, or hospitals. Others might
have refused the interview because of
their poor health.
The NHIS provides an estimate of can-
cer prevalence based on individuals' self-
reports and, therefore, would be expected
to be less accurate than cancer registries
that rely on clinically documented cancer
diagnoses. The NHIS relies on accounts
of diagnoses that may have occurred 30 or
more years ago; while a diagnosis of can-
cer is likely a very salient event, evidence
from the survey research literature sug-
gests that the accuracy of recall declines
markedly with time (6,7). Misunderstand-
ing of the survey question might also ex-
plain some of the underreporting. Indi-
viduals were asked to report whether a
medical doctor had ever told them that
they had cancer; however, some may have
failed to report their history of cancer if
they considered themselves cured of the
disease. Others may not have reported
cancer to shorten the NHIS interview and
to avoid further questions. The reluctance

to report socially undesirable behaviors
and conditions in surveys has been well
documented, and some may have failed to
report cancer because of social stigma
(7,8). Certain cancers that may be subject
to stigma (e.g., colorectal cancer among
men and women and lung cancer among
men) were prone to underreporting. A
similar pattern of underreporting by can-
cer site was evident in analyses of the
1987 NHIS (5).
Whatever the mechanism, underascer-
tainment or underreporting appears to be
mainly a problem among men. To the ex-
tent that there may be a geographic varia-
tion in cancer incidence or survival rates,
the U.S. sample may differ from the
population represented in the Connecticut
registry. However, geographic variation
in cancer incidence does not explain the
difference in prevalence as ascertained by
survey and registry. During 1990 through
1994, the total cancer incidence rate in
Connecticut was lower than that for the
nation for males but not for females (9).
Other cancers (e.g., female genital can-
cers) were overreported. This overreport-
ing could be explained if some women
confused positive screening tests with a
diagnosis of cancer. There is evidence of
misreporting cancer site, especially
among women. This could be explained
in part if individuals with recurrent cancer
reported the site of a recurrent cancer
when they were asked about the site of
cancer that was first diagnosed.
Long-term cancer survivors are likely
to be those who were diagnosed at an
early stage of the disease and who expe-
rienced successful treatment. According
to the 1992 NHIS, most cancer survivors
have lived 5 or more years following their
diagnosis and more than one third rated
their health as excellent or good. Even
though cancer survivors may not be simi-
lar to all who have undergone treatment
for cancer, it is of interest to assess as-
pects of their care experience.
The majority of cancer survivors (di-
agnosed within the last 10 years) had re-
ceived a second or multiple opinions
regarding their treatment. Widely publi-
cized treatment options for breast cancer
may account for higher rates of second
opinions among women diagnosed with
breast cancer. Hispanics are less likely to
have health insurance and other resources
to pay for care; therefore, it is surprising
to find a threefold greater likelihood of
use of a second opinion among Hispanics.
Health insurance status at the time of di-
agnosis is likely a strong predictor of use
of a second opinion, but this variable was
not available for analysis. Perhaps the
practice of seeking opinions from differ-
ent doctors was not well understood (e.g.,
the question asked whether more than one
opinion was sought, without specifying
that it was the opinions of the doctors that
were germane).
Cancer patients may have multiple
treatment options to consider. Educational
materials can provide information about
cancer, its treatment, and community re-
sources available to aid individuals and
their families. Nearly 60% of cancer sur-
vivors were given written patient infor-
mation materials by their providers. Being
under age 65 years at diagnosis was pre-
dictive of receipt of educational materials.
It is not clear whether providers are more
likely to give information to younger pa-
tients or whether younger patients are
more likely to request information (or
perhaps recall receiving information).
Other research (10) suggests that seeking
information from doctors and nurses de-
clines with age. Cancer organizations,
such as the American Cancer Society and
the National Cancer Institute, offer a
wealth of information; however, accord-
ing to the NHIS, they appear to be under-
utilized, with only 11% of cancer survi-
vors contacting them following their
diagnosis.
Cancer takes a psychologic as well as a
physical toll, and it is therefore surprising
that fewer than 15% of cancer survivors
had received counseling or had partici-
pated in support groups. Most survivors
said that they did not need or desire coun-
seling or support services, but nearly one
in 10 who did not receive these services
did not know that they were available.
Other research also shows relatively low
use of formal support groups. In a survey
of individuals treated at cancer facilities
throughout Texas, only 23% belonged to
a support group. Most respondents had
not been asked to join such a group (11).
Clinical trials and other research pro-
grams often provide the best possible care
for patients with certain types of cancer.
Only 5% of cancer survivors reported
having participated in research studies.
There are few recent estimates of involve-
ment in cancer research to serve as a com-
parison, but about 2% of adult cancer pa-
tients enroll in National Cancer Institute-
sponsored cooperative group clinical
trials (12). Patients may also participate in
other government-sponsored (e.g., De-
partment of Defense or Department of
Veterans Affairs) or privately sponsored
(e.g., pharmaceutical or biotechnology
companies) cancer research.
A diagnosis of cancer can limit access
to health and life insurance because of
pre-existing condition clauses in policies.
Furthermore, individuals with private
health insurance coverage can experience
premium rate increases or can be dropped
from plans. The U.S. Congress tried to
remedy this problem in 1996, enacting the
Health Insurance Portability and Ac-
countability Act (Kennedy­Kassebaum
Act) to improve the portability and conti-
nuity of health insurance coverage in pri-
vate insurance markets and among em-
ployer-sponsored group health plans. The
Act limits the ability of insurers to deny
or discontinue coverage because of pre-
existing conditions such as cancer. The
increased cost of the premiums for por-
table insurance products and difficulties
in implementing the law, however, have
limited the value of the new protections
for consumers (13).
In 1992, roughly one in nine cancer
survivors reported that they had been de-
nied health or life insurance coverage be-
cause of cancer and just over one in 20
cancer survivors with private health insur-
ance reported that their health insurance
coverage changed because of cancer fol-
lowing their diagnosis.
Nearly one in five cancer survivors
employed around the time of their diag-
nosis reported work-related problems
stemming from their cancer diagnosis.
Most of these related to "job-lock," an
inability to change jobs because of a fear
of loss of insurance coverage or medical
privacy issues. This estimate is much
lower than other surveys would suggest.
In a 1992 survey of cancer patients treated
at an acute-care, comprehensive cancer
center in Houston, TX, the majority
(58%) said that they would not leave their
current position because of health insur-
ance (14). This survey's focus was dis-
crimination in employment, and those
with problems may have been more likely
to participate. Patients treated at the com-
prehensive cancer center may also have
experienced more problems than those
represented in the survey because they
had more severe disease.
According to the 1992 NHIS, some
cancer survivors experience workplace
discrimination--4% reported having been
fired or laid off from their job because of
their cancer, and 5% said that they faced
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 91, No. 17, September 1, 1999 REPORTS 1485
on-the-job problems from their employer
or supervisor directly related to their can-
cer. Discriminatory practices have been
reported more often in other surveys
(14,15).
In summary, the 1992 NHIS provides
valuable information on the medical care
experience and social implications of a
diagnosis of cancer. While there appears
to be some degree of underreporting of
cancer relative to estimates from cancer
registry data, the 1992 NHIS is one of the
few sources of information about cancer
survivorship from a nationally represen-
tative sample of U.S. households. Other
information on cancer survivorship is
forthcoming from two large studies being
conducted by the American Cancer Soci-
ety (16).
