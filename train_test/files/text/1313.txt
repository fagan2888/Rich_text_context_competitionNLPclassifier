ABSTRACT
Objective: To provide information on
the characteristics of eating disorders
based on nationally representative sam-
ples of African American and Caribbean
Black adults and adolescents.
Method: Conducted between 2001 and
2003 the National Survey of American
Life (NSAL) interviewed adults (n 5 5,191)
and adolescents (n 5 1,170) in their
homes. Professionally trained inter-
viewers used the WMH Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI-
WHO Organization 2004-modified) to
assess DSM-IV TR eating disorders.
Results: Anorexia was the rarest eating
disorder among African American adults
and adolescents, with age of onset for
adults in mid adolescence. No 12-month
case of anorexia was found among Carib-
bean Black adults. Binge eating was the
most prevalent eating disorder among
adults and adolescents. Persistence of
disorders was lowest for anorexia and
highest for binge eating disorder among
adults.
Conclusion: Prevalence of eating disor-
ders within the U.S. Black population
varies by type of disorder, age cohort,
gender, and ethnic group among adults,
and by type of disorder among adoles-
cents. Clinicians need preparation and
training to recognize and treat eating dis-
orders in ethnically-diverse patient popu-
lations. V

Introduction
Few studies have examined eating disorders among
Blacks. Those that have found that binge eating dis-
order occurs with equal or greater frequency for
African American and White women,1 while ano-
rexia nervosa (AN) is rarely found among African
American women.2 These studies, however, often
are limited to specific populations (e.g., college stu-
dents, women) or regions of the country.3 To
address the limitations of previous research specifi-
cally among Blacks, the current study comprehen-
sively examined the prevalence, age of onset, per-
sistence and gender differences in eating disorders
in a nationally representative sample of African
American and Caribbean Black adults and adoles-
cents.
Method
Participants
A national probability sample of households was
drawn based on adult population estimates and power
calculations for detecting differences in the two adult
samples, using the African American sample as the pri-
mary core sampling base for the study. Every household
that included an adult (18 years and older) participant
was screened for an eligible adolescent. Adolescents were
selected using a random selection procedure at the
household level. In-home personal interviews were con-
ducted with 5,191 adults (n 5 3,570 African American,
n 5 1,621 Caribbean Blacks) and 1,170 adolescents (n 5
810 African American and n 5 360 Caribbean Blacks).
The age range of the respondents was 18­94 for adults
and 13­17 for adolescents. Gender distributions among
the African American (adults 5 44% male, 56% female;
adolescents 5 50% male, 50% female) and Caribbean

EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES
Black samples (adults 5 51% male, 49% female; adoles-
cents 5 45% male, 55% female) were relatively equal.
Instruments and Procedures
Data collection was from February 2001 to March 2003
and the response rate was 73% among adults and 81%
among adolescents. Details of the methodology used for
the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) have been
previously described,4 including details of the sample
design, weighting, and variance estimation.5,6 The WMH
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-
CIDI-WHO Organization 2004 modified),7 was used to
measure eating disorders. This diagnostic interview
schedule met the DSM-IV TR eating disorders criteria for
AN and bulimia nervosa (BN).8 For the purposes of this
report the terms binge eating disorder with hierarchy
(``BED'') and ``any binge eating'' also are used. BED is
defined as binge eating with no purging or AN. Any binge
eating is classified as a behavior rather than a syndrome.
These definitions are consistent with the National
Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R) guidelines.9
Thus, we examined two DSM-IV TR eating disorders (AN,
BN), one proposed disorder (BED), and one entity that
partially overlapped with one or more of the disorders
(any binge eating).
Analytic procedures were used to properly adjust
standard errors, confidence intervals, and significance
tests for the complex sample design of the NSAL. All
analyses were weighted to be nationally representative of
populations and subgroups of interest. Crosstabulations
were used to calculate the prevalence estimates of the
eating disorders by ethnicity and by gender. Cox propor-
tional hazards regression was used to estimate the odds
ratios of developing the disorders for the ethnic and gen-
der groups.10 Ages of onset of the eating disorders were
ascertained by respondents' retrospective reports. All
analyses were conducted using survey procedures of the
SAS Version 9.1.3 software package.11 SAS uses the Tay-
lor-series linearization technique for calculating the
complex-design-based estimates of variance.
Results
Prevalence of Eating Disorders
As shown in Table 1, among the 5,191 adults, the
lifetime prevalence estimates were greatest for any
eating disorder, followed by BED, BN, and AN,
respectively. The 12-month prevalence estimates
were less than the corresponding lifetime esti-
mates. No 12-month case of AN was found among
Caribbean black adults, and there were no ethnic
differences in lifetime or 12-month prevalence esti-
mates for other eating disorders. Cox proportional

BLACKS AND EATING DISORDERS
International Journal of Eating Disorders 40 S10­S14 2007--DOI 10.1002/eat S11
hazards regression models adjusting for ethnicity
and gender revealed that males were significantly
less likely to develop any binge eating than were
females (OR 5 0.35, 95%CI: 0.17­0.71).
Among the 1,170 adolescents, the 12-month
prevalence estimates were greatest among any
binge eating, BN, BED, and AN, respectively. No
ethnic differences were found (Table 1).
Age of Onset and Persistence
Adults were most at risk of developing an eating
disorder between 12 and 30 years of age. AN had
both the lowest mean and median ages of onset
compared with other eating disorders; but only the
average age of onset for BED was significantly
higher than age of onset for AN (Table 2).
The average number of years that an eating dis-
order lasted among adults was lowest for AN and
highest for BED. There were no differences in
length of persistence between AN and other eating
disorders (Table 2). The 12-month prevalence
among adults with a lifetime history was lowest for
AN and highest for BED (Tables 1 and 2).
Prevalence of Eating Disorders by Gender
Among adults, women had higher lifetime preva-
lence of any binge eating and 12-month prevalence
of BN, and BED than men. Marginally significant
gender differences were found for adults with life-
time prevalence of BN and any binge eating with
women experiencing higher prevalence than men.
No significant gender differences were found
among adolescents; however, it is notable that
more cases of boys than girls were reported with
12-month prevalence for AN, BN, and any binge
eating.
Conclusion
This is the first study to examine the prevalence,
age of onset, persistence and gender differences in
eating disorders in a nationally representative sam-
ple of African American and Caribbean Black adults
and adolescents. Findings from this study are con-
sistent with previous research that shows that AN is
uncommon among African Americans. Although
the prevalence rates for AN were low (lifetime 5
0.17% adults), our findings for African American
adults were consistent with the low prevalence
(0.6%) reported in the NCS-R.9 Further, the age of
onset for AN was during mid adolescence (14.89)
for African American adults in the NSAL compared
with late adolescence (18.9) in the NCS-R,9 with no
cases among African Americans occurring after age
19 in the NSAL. Combined with no reports of AN
among Caribbean Black adults, these findings sug-
gests that African Americans may be more at risk
for AN than Caribbean Blacks, with a younger age
of onset than the general US population. This
younger age of onset is cause for concern since
research consistently indicates that AN is most
likely to begin in late adolescence.2 The emergence
of AN in mid-adolescence in a population that
clinicians are not accustomed to treating will result
in Black youth going undiagnosed and untreated

for longer periods of time. It is not clear from this
study what may have protected Caribbean blacks
from developing AN. Future research is needed to
examine this issue from a cultural perspective.
BN was more common than AN in both ethnic
groups, with higher lifetime prevalence rates for
BN (1.49% adults) than that reported by Striegel-
Moore et al.,2 at 0.4% for Black women. The NSAL
data, however, are consistent with findings from
the NCS-R for adults overall (1.0%), and with regard
to gender (women: NSAL 5 1.90, NCS-R 5 1.5%;
men: NSAL 5 0.97, NCS-R 5 0.5%). The mean age
of onset was 19.44 in the NSAL compared with 19.7
in the NCS-R.9 Findings from the current study
indicate that the rates of BN among Blacks may not
be as uncommon as once believed, with similar age
of onset as most previous studies in this area.
Because it is often unanticipated among Blacks, it
can be easily under diagnosed. Reasons why Blacks
are experiencing a higher prevalence in BN have
been postulated to be associated with stress,
including acculturated stress.12 That is, the more
Blacks feel pressure to assimilate with the domi-
nant culture in America, the greater their risk for
body image dissatisfaction and development of
BN.12 Perhaps the positive body self perceptions
that once protected Blacks from eating disorders
may be beginning to erode.13
Consistent with previous research,2,9 binge eat-
ing was the most prevalent eating disorder among
Blacks in the NSAL. Males were significantly less
likely to develop binge eating than women, indicat-
ing that males may have developed protective
mechanisms against this disordered behavior but
may have more issues around behaviors that
emphasize slim athletic build.14 While most eating
disorders had an age of onset during adolescence,
binge eating had the highest age of onset (22.75),
which is consistent with the NCS-R (25.4).9 This
older age of onset may reflect less of a concern for
smaller body size than concern with environmental
stressors. It is plausible that exposure to economic
deprivation and other stressors may have had an
effect on the desire to consume more food as a cop-
ing mechanism.15 Once poor dietary habits are
formed they are difficult to change. Adults tend to
be less active and are involved in less physical
activities than their adolescent counterparts.
Persistence of an eating disorder was lowest for
AN and highest for binge eating. The persistence
for AN in the NSAL was approximately twice that in
the NCS-R while BN in the NCS-R was more than
1.5 times that seen in the NSAL.9 These data sug-
gest that while AN may be uncommon among
Blacks, those that do experience AN have a longer
battle with the disorder. Conversely, Blacks in the
NSAL experience shorter durations with BN, binge
eating, and BED than other ethnic and racial
groups that have been studied.9 This suggests that
short term duration for these disorders may be
indicators for health care providers to prescreen
Blacks for eating disorders and not to discount
short-term disordered eating behavior as nondiag-
nostic.
As in previous research, adult women had higher
prevalence of eating disorders than men in the
NSAL. These findings are supported by results from
the NCS-R.9 We found no gender difference in eat-
ing disorders among the adolescents; however,
more boys than girls were affected by eating disor-
ders. Although our numbers are small, they do
point to a tendency for boys to exhibit eating disor-
dered behaviors during adolescence. Other studies
point to weight restrictions for sports participation
(i.e., football, boxing, wrestling, etc.) as one reason
for this trend.14 Our findings provide evidence that
Black boys may not be immune to eating disorders.
This is an area that future research should be rigor-
ously pursued.
In sum, although the prevalence of most eating
disorders among Blacks is uncommon, certain dis-
orders are more prevalent among specific ethnic
subgroups of Blacks (e.g., African Americans and
AN), age of onset appears to be younger for AN,
while persistence of the disorder may be longer for
AN and shorter for BN and binge eating disorders.
Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that cul-
tural differences must be considered when diag-
nosing eating disorders in Black populations. Clini-
cians must be prepared to recognize and treat pop-
ulations that are often considered to be least likely
to develop an eating disorder. This will require
training to work with diverse cultural groups to
ensure that appropriate treatment is provided. Spe-
cialists in adult and pediatric/adolescent health-
care should be educated to possible differences
regarding prevalence, age of onset, persistence and
gender differences in eating disorders to appropri-
ately assess, and diagnose eating disorders among
subgroups of Black people. The era, social climate,
and subculture in which a person was raised may
have significant effects on their risk for developing
an eating disorder.
Culturally sensitive criteria need to be incorpo-
rated into the DSM-V for eating disorders that con-
sider subcultural, gender, and age variations. Rec-
ommendations for DSM-V should include the fol-
lowing: earlier screening for AN among African
Americans as young as early to mid adolescence;
once diagnosed with AN, African Americans need

longer durations of follow-up and treatment.
Although it is unclear why other eating disorders
among Blacks such as BN or BED have a shorter du-
ration, earlier and more frequent screening may be
necessary to aid in capturing cases of these disorders.
