Introduction
"I'm hated in Malmö!" This is the headline of an article in
southern Sweden's biggest daily newspaper, Sydsvenska
Dagbladet (SDS), in which a young woman with Jewish
identity expresses why she has moved from Malmö in
southern Sweden to Israel. In the article, she describes
how she has been regularly called a "bloody Jewish
whore" at school and is increasingly afraid of being
exposed to anti-Semitic hate crime (SDS, July 19, 2015).
Other people and their families have also moved from
Malmö to other parts of Sweden or to Israel in recent years
and have talked to the media about Jews' vulnerability and
their decision to move, which has attracted international
attention.
Although anti-Semitic incidents have occurred through-
out Sweden, most of the focus has been on one city in
particular, Malmö. Located in the south of the country,
Malmö is Sweden's third largest city (300,000 inhabit-
ants) and is well known from the television series The
Bridge, which is seen across large parts of the world.
Since 1994, the Social Democrats have been the dominat-
ing party in the city.
More than 170 nationalities are represented in Malmö. The
largest groups come from Iraq, Denmark, ex-Yugoslavia,
Poland, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. According to statistics pub-
lished in 2013, 30% (about 92,000) of the population of
Malmö were born outside Sweden and about 11% were born
in Sweden to parents originating from another country (www.
malmo.se, February 19, 2014). As religion and ethnicity are
not listed in the Swedish statistics, it is difficult to say exactly
how many Jews there are in Sweden and in Malmö. The
Official Council of Swedish Jewish Communities estimates
the number of Jews in Sweden to be around 20,000 (www.
judiskacentralradet.se).According to the information provided
by the Jewish community in Malmö, there were 2,000 mem-
bers in the 1970s. Ten years ago, the number was 1,000, while
today there are only 600. However, not all Jews living in
Malmö are members of the community (www.jfm.se, May 15,
2014).
White power groups (neo-Nazi) are active in Sweden
today, and some anti-Semitic hate crimes are committed by
their members. In Malmö, however, White power groups are
very small. But the right-wing populist party, the Sweden
Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna), which was a very small
party around 15 years ago with strong connections to the
White Power Movement, is now an important actor in the
Swedish Parliament. The Sweden Democrats received 12.9%
of the votes in the parliamentary elections in 2014, including
13.5% of the votes in Malmö, and have a political manifesto
that prioritizes reduced immigration, resistance to multicul-
turalism and to Islam, which resembles the agendas of

Media Images and Experiences of Being a
Jew in the Swedish City of Malmö
Anders Wigerfelt1 and Berit Wigerfelt1
Abstract
A series of high-profile incidents in and after 2008 placed Malmö in southern Sweden on the national and international map
as a place that was unsafe for people identified as Jews. The primary aim of this article is to explore and exemplify what
it is like to live with Jewish identity in Malmö within a framework of how the media reports anti-Semitism and how this
group copes with being the potential target of anti-Semitic harassment and hate crime. Based on interviews with people
with Jewish identity in Malmö, we analyze and discuss their experiences using different themes, such as violent and everyday
anti-Semitism, the local impact of the Israel­Palestine conflict, how media images affect their lives, and how exposure and
vulnerability are dealt with. The findings are important in terms of both possible long-term measures against anti-Semitism
and as immediate support for those targeted.

similar popular parties in Europe (Borevi, 2013). The party is
divided in attitudes toward Jews--that are primarily Muslims
who are considered a danger for Sweden--but there are party
members who openly declare anti-Jewish positions (Ravid,
2013).
A series of high-profile incidents in and after 2008 placed
Malmö on the national and international map as a place that
was unsafe for people identified as Jews (see, for example,
Sunday Telegraph, January 29, 2010). In the Swedish and
international press, Malmö has been described as a city in
which anti-Semitism flourishes; an anti-Semitism that is
fueled by the Israel­Palestine conflict and which targets
Swedish Jews as responsible for the actions taken by the
state of Israel (see, for example, Aftonbladet [AB], August
14, 2014; Göteborgs Posten [GP], February 27, 2010;
Skånska Dagbladet [SkD], January 25, 2010). In 2012, the
situation in Malmö was considered so serious that Barack
Obama sent his special envoy, Hannah Rosenthal, to gather
more information about the situation there. Since 2010, the
international Simon Wiesenthal Centre has been advising
Jews not to travel to Malmö because their safety cannot be
guaranteed due to the high risk of exposure to hate crime
(SDS, October 1, 2012; SDS, March 8, 2013). The focus on
Malmö can also be discerned in newspaper headlines, such
as "USA's envoy reaches hateful Malmö" (Kvällsposten
[KvP], April 24, 2012) and "The eyes of the world are
focused on Malmö" (SDS, February 27, 2012).
Media exposure like this could have affected both the
image of Jews'exposure to hate crime and the Jewish experi-
ence of such exposure. The media's contributions are impor-
tant when it comes to structuring the images and discourses
that help people to interpret the world (Golding & Murdock,
2000; S. Hall, 1997). Based on a combined interview and
media study, this article examines Jews' experiences of vul-
nerability and anti-Semitic hate crime in Malmö in a frame-
work of how the media reports anti-Semitism of the city of
Malmö as a special place for hate crime. The connection
between the media's news reporting and the experience of
anti-Semitic harassment and hate crimes is, to our knowl-
edge, not previously researched.
We are aware that ethnic identity and positions are not
always the most important aspects, but that dimensions such
as gender, race, class, religion, and age can interact intersec-
tionally in complex ways. We all have multiple identities.
Identity is a positioning that is dependent on a specific con-
text and can be chosen or forced (Börjesson & Palmblad,
2008; Chancer & Watkins, 2009; Hammarén & Johansson,
2009). As there are major differences among and between
Jews, generalizing Jews as a group can be dangerous. Despite
the difficulties associated with generalizations, we have cho-
sen to use the identity position Jews in the text. This catego-
rization could help to identify the vulnerability of specific
groups, even though there is risk of stereotyped notions
being reproduced (see Strömblad & Myrberg, 2015, for a
discussion about the dilemmas of categorization).
The primary aim of this article is to explore and exemplify
what it is like to live with Jewish identity in Malmö within a
framework of how the media reports anti-Semitism and how
this group copes with being the potential target of anti-
Semitic harassment and hate crime.
In the study, this aim is broken down into three specific
questions:
·
· How do people with Jewish identity experience their
lives in Malmö?
·
· How is vulnerability dealt with in cases of obvious
and potential hate crime?
·
· How is the media image of Malmö as a city that is
especially prone to anti-Semitic hate crime?
Listening to victims' stories is vital and enables us to gain
access to and understand openly manifested anti-Semitism as
well as the more subtle expressions of prejudice and stereo-
typing. Based on interviews with people with Jewish identity
in Malmö, we analyze and discuss their experiences using
different themes, such as violent and everyday anti-Semi-
tism, the local impact of the Israel­Palestine conflict, how
media images affect their lives, and how exposure and vul-
nerability are dealt with. The findings are important in terms
of both possible long-term measures against anti-Semitism
and as immediate support for those targeted.
Previous Research and the Theoretical
Point of Departure
In recent years, reports of anti-Semitic hate crimes against
Jews and Jewish institutions have increased in Europe as a
whole and range from the vandalism of Jewish burial grounds
to murder (Iganski, 2013, Rich, 2014; Smith, 2012). In
December 2013, the European Union Agency for
Fundamental Rights (FRA) published the report titled
Discrimination and Hate Crime Against Jews in EU Member
States: Experiences and Perceptions of Anti-Semitism.
Around 5,500 Jews in eight member states, of which Sweden
was one, responded to an online survey about anti-Semitism
and hate crime. The survey showed that many Jews had been
exposed to anti-Semitism and hate crime in the examined
countries. On average, 66% of the respondents regarded anti-
Semitism as major problem. In Sweden, the figure was 60%.
Eighty percent of the respondents in Sweden said that anti-
Semitism had increased in recent years. Of those responding
in Sweden, 22% said that they had personally been subjected
to verbal or physical attacks in 2012, although 75% said that
they had not reported this to the police because they did not
think that it would lead anywhere (FRA, 2013).
Some of the anti-Semitic incidents/hate crimes in Sweden
are reported to the police, although the number of unrecorded
cases is probably great. The Swedish National Council for
Crime Prevention publishes annual statistics on the number
of reported hate crimes,1 including those with an anti-Semitic
Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt 3
motive. The statistics show that more hate crimes were
reported to the police in 2014 (270 cases) than in 2013 (190
cases; Brå, National Council for Crime Prevention, 2015). It
is difficult to say anything definite about the intensity of anti-
Semitism based on reports to the police and online surveys.
The only thing that we can be sure about is that being Jewish
in Sweden in 2015 is problematic, even though many regard
Jews as part of the "white" establishment in Sweden (Nylund
Skog, 2006).
The influence of anti-Semitism on Swedish thinking and
acting in a historical perspective is well documented in
research (see, for example, Andersson, 2000; Bachner, 2009;
Berggren, 1999; Carlsson, 2004; Tydén, 1986). Kvist Geverts
(2008) uses the phrase "background noise" to explain that
while most people condemned anti-Semitism in Germany,
anti-Semitic notions were "normal" in society and were
always present, like a constant murmur. However, Kvist
Geverts's metaphor has been criticized. Tydén (2010) claims
that Kvist Geverts takes anti-Semitism for granted, and thus
does not examine whether the different treatments of Jews
can be due to various causes. Åmark (2011) explains that
there was a change in the beginning of the 1930s toward
polarization of views on anti-Semitism. For example,
Swedish Nazis use vulgar anti-Semitic propaganda, while
others previously involved in everyday anti-Semitism
reacted by distancing themselves from the anti-Semitic
speech.
After the Second World War, anti-Semitism was regarded
as something that belonged to the past. However, in many
parts of the world, including Sweden, anti-Semitic hate
speech and violence are again on the rise (Bergmann, 2008;
MacShane, 2008; Salzborn, 2010). Studies report that Jewish
communities continue to experience violence against people
and their property--synagogues, cemeteries, businesses, and
homes (Bunzl, 2005; Salzborn, 2010; Smith, 2012). The
growth of new communication and transport technologies
facilitates the dissemination of anti-Semitic ideas between
different countries and leads to the creation of local and
international anti-Semitic ideological networks (Judaken,
2008; Watts, 2001). Such tendencies are visible not only in
the Middle East, where anti-Jewish sentiments are often
linked to hostility toward Israel, but also in the West, where
in the last decade incidents of anti-Semitic expression and
violence have become more visible (Balogh, 2011;
Bergmann, 2008; Cohen et al., 2009; Iganski, 2013; Iganski
& Kosmin, 2003; Partington, 2012; Peace, 2009; Smith,
2012).
The academic literature on anti-Semitic hate crime in
Europe is extensive. Much of the literature argues that
today's anti-Semitic hate crimes are triggered by the con-
flicts in the Middle East--often referred to as "new anti-
Semitism" (e.g., Bacquet, 2009; Bunzl, 2005; Chesler, 2003;
Forster & Epstein, 1974; FRA, 2013; Glazer, 2010; Iganski,
2013; Iganski & Kosmin, 2003; Levy, 1991; MacShane,
2008; Marrus et al., 2005; Rensmann & Schoeps, 2010;
Silverstein, 2008; Smith, 2012; Taguieff, 2004). Many of
these authors argue that a new wave or outbreak of hostility
toward Jews in Europe began with the start of the second
Palestinian intifada in September 2000 and is still making its
presence felt. This "new anti-Semitism" manifests itself as
hostility toward the state of Israel, which implies that there is
a parity between individual Jews and the state of Israel
(Cohen et al., 2009; Fine, 2009; Glazer, 2010; Judaken,
2008; Klug, 2003).2 Several researchers claim that if the
"old" anti-Semitism mainly had been advocated by the
extreme right, the new wave of anti-Semitism was spread
partly by the left (see, for example, Ulrich, 2013; Wistrich,
2010). This also applies to Sweden according to Bachner
(2000), who contends that it was certainly only extreme right
groups who stood for open anti-Semitism, but from the 1960s
variations of anti-Semitism have also been expressed by
some left groups.
Some scholars emphasize that anti-Semitism stems from
prejudices, ideologies, and conspiracy theories portraying
Jews as powerful, cunning, and dangerous (e.g., Bergmann,
2008; Bilewicz & Krzeminski, 2010; Byford, 2003; Kersten
& Hankel, 2013; Rensmann & Schoeps, 2010; Rudling,
2006). Much of this literature argues that understanding the
causes of anti-Semitic hate crime also means recognizing the
conspiratorial and mythical nature of the anti-Semitic ideol-
ogy. As Bergmann (2008) notes, the core feature of anti-
Semitic conspiracy theory and prejudice is that Jews are
regarded as the embodiment of supranational modern phe-
nomena, such as international financial markets, commu-
nism, and liberal values. Accordingly, their rapid social
advancement in most European societies is interpreted as
confirmation that Jews secretly dominate the economic and
political world (Byford, 2003). According to these studies,
the causes and persistence of anti-Semitic hate crimes in
Europe cannot be understood if the mythical and conspirato-
rial nature of anti-Semitic ideologies is not accounted for.
In line with scholars like Bachner and Ring (2005), we
argue that traditional anti-Jewish thinking has contributed to
the intensification of anti-Semitism in Europe, which is
explained by its deep historical and cultural roots. However,
latent anti-Semitism is fanned into life by external events and
developments and the reactions they trigger (Bachner &
Ring, 2005; see also Klug, 2003). Similarly, Iganski (2008)
argues that the Israel­Palestine conflict sometimes serves as
a catalyst for the venting of prejudices that for many people
are simmering below the surface.
The literature on anti-Semitism in Sweden today tends to
view anti-Semitism as something that is mainly manifested
among Muslims (Bevelander & Hjerm, 2015; Tossavainen,
2005). However, Bachner (2014) warns against reducing
anti-Semitism to a "Muslim problem" and thinks that anti-
Semitism should be understood as a wider social problem.
This is also one of our points of departure.
What a victim perceives as anti-Semitic harassment is not
always regarded as a crime from a legal point of view,
4 SAGE Open
although this does not negate the victim's lived experience of
the event. Even though the media often highlights and
focuses on violent hate crime, many victims say that it is not
the violence that is "psychologically worst" but rather the
everyday "low-level" nature of the crimes (McClintock,
2005). Studies, such as that conducted by Iganski (2008) on
the different categories of people exposed to hate crime,
show that such crimes are often committed as part of the nor-
mal everyday routine. If harassment is part of everyday "nor-
mality," it is less likely to be reported to the police and
becomes part of the victim's everyday life (see also Wang,
2002). This so-called "everyday anti-Semitism" has been
underexplored so far. The modes of oppression are in some
ways similar to what is called "everyday sexism" (Bates,
2014).
From a legal point of view, anti-Semitic hate crime and
hate crime in general are often regarded as well-defined and
separate events, although according to Bowling (1999) they
should be seen as part of a continuous chain. Hate crime is
generally based on prejudice, and it is difficult to say where
a hate crime starts and stops. It is rather an ongoing process
with a cumulative effect; a dynamic process that develops
over time in a specific social, political, and historic context
(Bowling, 1999). Iganski, Kielinger, and Paterson (2005)
maintain that like hate crime in general, anti-Semitic inci-
dents do not occur in a vacuum but take place in a cultural
context in which prejudice and violence are used as social
resources.
Many scholars claim that hate crime is worse than many
other crimes because it signals that the group to which the
victim belongs should "know its place" and that compared
with other categories many hate crime victims suffer from
long-term psychological problems such as fear, depression,
anxiety, panic attacks, a loss of self-confidence, and sleep-
lessness (Ehrlich, Larcom, & Purvis, 1994; N. Hall, 2005;
Herek, Cogan, & Gillis, 2002; Iganski, 2008). McDevitt,
Balboni, Garcia, and Gu (2003) mean that the consequences
of hate crime are different from those of other crimes, in that
the victims are replaceable, that is, anyone in the targeted
group could be a victim. In addition, it is not only the victim
who experiences problems later on but also the group to
which the victim belongs or is seen to belong. Some victims
of hate crime are afraid of being targeted again because they
belong to a certain group (Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino,
2002). According to Craig (2002), hate crime is a unique
form of aggression that prevents targeted individuals and
groups living a "free" life. Potential victims experience that
they need to be careful and perhaps even conceal their iden-
tity, which restricts their movements and lives. As one study
on anti-Semitism in Sweden (Nylund Skog, 2006) shows,
hiding one's Jewish identity by concealing symbols like the
Star of David and the kippah is common.
The fear of being exposed to hate crime due to group
affinity can also be strengthened by the media's descriptions.
The extent to which different target groups are portrayed in
the media depends on a number of factors. Some groups have
stronger voices than others, and can therefore be regarded as
more exposed. It is therefore difficult to determine which
groups are most vulnerable to hate crime as a result of media
reporting. The media in turn can influence opinion by setting
the agenda for which type of hate crime is featured
(Strömbäck, 2009). According to Munro (2014), the media
plays an important role in this process, in that it can choose
which hate crime victims to report on and which to ignore.
Our knowledge about hate crime is often limited to what we
read in the newspapers or watch on TV, which can give us the
impression that hate crime victims are exposed to extreme
violence. Drama sells and the media often focuses on the
most extreme cases. Behind the reported incidents of extreme
violence are thousands of other, more everyday, incidents
that do not make the news (see, for example, Tiby, 2010).
Serious crimes are often overrepresented in the media, and
the reporting of crime can reinforce the fear of being exposed
(Chermak, 1998; Gunter, 1987; Reiner, Livingstone, &
Allen, 2000).
According to Haavisto and Petersson (2013), although
our attitudes may not change as a result of a newspaper arti-
cle or blog spot, if a way of thinking or perspective is repeated
and hammered year after year from many different directions
it can affect our self-image and understanding of the world.
Research (see, for example, Demker, 2014; Sandberg &
Demker, 2014) indicates that there may be a connection
between how people experience a concern, for example, anti-
Semitism, and how often the media highlights the different
events linked to it. There could thus be a connection between
the extent of the media coverage of hate crime incidents in
Malmö and Jewish people's concern about being targeted.
This connection is one of the issues that we examine in this
study.
We use aspects of agenda-setting theory to analyze the
media's representations of anti-Semitic hate crime in Malmö.
Agenda-setting theory is about which social issues are given
most attention in the media. The first level concerns which
objects--factual matters, organizations, and people--are
high on the media's agenda. The second level concerns how
the media reports certain issues and how the general public
understands them. This shifts the focus to how prominent the
different attributes are on different agendas. By attributes,
we mean the qualities and characteristics that are associated
with various objects (Strömbäck, 2009). Hate crime as an
object has attracted considerable interest and been high on
the media's agenda in recent years, with Malmö being espe-
cially highlighted as a city in which anti-Semitic hate crime
has escalated. A number of incidents, which we call here key
incidents, have put Malmö on the map both nationally and
internationally. What is known as priming is found at the sec-
ond level of agenda-setting theory and concerns the interplay
between the media content and a person's cognitive state
(Strömbäck, 2009). The mind can be seen as an associative
network consisting of different nodes and links that connect
Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt 5
the nodes to each other, as per the associative network model
(Fiske & Taylor, 1991). The links between the different
nodes are both cognitive and affective, and relate to which
objects are associated with each other and how a person feels
about the links (Strömbäck, 2009). The object Malmö acts as
a node, which for many people is connected with the nodes
of anti-Semitism and hate crime. The more often we hear
about Malmö and anti-Semitic hate crime, the more likely
we are to connect Malmö with this.
Materials and Method
This article is mostly based on in-depth interviews conducted
within the project titled "Hate Crime--A Challenge to
Democracy." This is a multidisciplinary study on hate crime
in Skåne that focuses on the causes, consequences, and sup-
port initiatives, and is financed by the Swedish Research
Council and the Swedish Crime Victim Compensation
Support Authority. The project studies groups that are often
exposed to crime, such as Jews, Muslims, Afroswedes,
Roma/Travelers, and the LGBT community, and this article
is based on one of the project's substudies.
As our primary aim in this article is to examine how peo-
ple who identify themselves as Jews in Malmö experience
and deal with anti-Semitic hate crime in a framework of
media reporting of anti-Semitism, we have interviewed peo-
ple with some connection to the Jewish community in
Malmö.All the interviews were semistructured, concentrated
on a number of fairly wide themes, were tape-recorded, and
later transcribed. An important intention with the interviews
has been to try to capture the informants' own meaning mak-
ing, that is, how they describe their own and others' experi-
ences of violation and hate crime. To formulate the relevant
research questions, we first presented our project at a meet-
ing (March 15, 2012) of the Jewish community in Malmö in
connection with a discussion about the subject of hate crime.
On that occasion, we were able to listen to different people's
experiences of anti-Semitic hate crime. We also met with a
Jewish cultural association (June 19, 2014). After a few
introductory interviews, the authors made contact with other
informants via the snowball method (Bryman, 2008). As this
method builds on other people's social contacts, the infor-
mants are not representative of the group in a statistical sense
(Bryman, 2008). The people we choose to interview all had
experiences of anti-Semitism. In one case, we contacted a
woman we had identified through the media. It should be
pointed out that very few people are convicted of hate crimes,
which makes it very difficult to contact informants who have
been officially recognized as hate crime victims. However,
despite the lack of convictions, we know that the number of
people affected by hate crime and similar incidents is great.
For this reason, we have been both broad and explorative in
our projections.
In this substudy, a total number of 11 people between the
ages of 16 and 67--seven women and four men--were
interviewed separately and are presented here with fictitious
names. All the informants identify themselves as Jewish and
are proud of it. All except one of the informants are well
established in Swedish society and were also born in Sweden.
They can thus be said to have a high social, economic, and
cultural capital. As the study does not include all Jewish indi-
viduals and groups in Malmö, the findings cannot be gener-
alized, although they can contribute to a deeper understanding
of the vulnerability that many experience. We stopped col-
lecting data when we considered that a "saturation" point had
been reached and when the results of the themes raised in the
interviews began to show similarities with each other
(Bryman, 2008). In the article, we have chosen to allow
many of the informants to speak for themselves by making
use of short, yet representative quotations from the con-
ducted interviews. We have also used longer narratives to
illustrate our conclusions and thereby create a better under-
standing of the problems. Miller (2000) maintains that in
studies based on life stories or biographical research, narra-
tive interviews are more oriented toward eliciting the infor-
mants' perspectives than objective facts. To a great extent,
the interviewer is part of the process, in that he or she is
included in the construction of the informant's story.
All the interviews were conducted in Swedish, and the
individual interviews lasted between 1 and 2 hr. The infor-
mants were told about the purpose of the study and that par-
ticipation was voluntary. Anonymity was also guaranteed.
We have made minor revisions to the language used when
translating from Swedish to English but have tried to stay as
close as possible to the original wording. Data were col-
lected, and analyses were conducted throughout the research
process. The interview guide was frequently revised to suit
the varying circumstances, in that questions were added and
some were omitted. The analysis began by listening to the
taped interviews and reading the transcriptions and docu-
mentation. The interviews were then coded according to the
central themes that had been identified. Comparisons were
made between the researchers'interpretations and the coding
revised accordingly. Theoretical concepts were then applied
to analyze the interpretations. This led to new questions,
which were addressed by returning to the empirical mate-
rial--an abductive process (Alvesson & Sköldberg, 1994)
that was enhanced by alternating between the theory and the
empirical material.
Attacks on Jewish buildings and individuals, for example,
the rabbi, are things that affect Jews as a group (see, for
example, Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino, 2002, on how
hate crime spreads fear). The image of Malmö as an anti-
Semitic bastion emerged at the end of 2008/beginning of
2009 and can be linked to the conflict between Israel and
Palestine. In the interviews, the informants often referred to
incidents that had been reported in the media, and that these
events and the media coverage of these events have affected
their experience of vulnerability, which led us to conduct a
media survey and content analysis of a qualitative and
6 SAGE Open
interpretive nature. We searched a variety of databases for
Swedish newspaper articles on anti-Semitism and hate crime
published between January 2009 and September 2015. This
search yielded 126 articles from a total of 31 different
Swedish daily newspapers at both the local and national lev-
els. The reporting mainly focused on news events but also
included in-depth interviews with Jews who in various ways
have been exposed to hate crime and contributed to debates.
In our analysis of the material, the main focus has been on
how the connection between the city of Malmö and anti-
Semitism is construed in the media. We began the investiga-
tion by sorting the material chronologically, which enabled
us to follow the media's portrayal of anti-Semitic hate crime
over time. We then tried to identify important key incidents,
that is, events that took place in Malmö and attracted wide
media coverage. It became apparent that these incidents had
also been reproduced intertextually in different newspapers
and in some cases also internationally. It also became clear
that different key incidents were reproduced over time. When
a new incident that could be linked to anti-Semitism occurred
in Malmö, the media connected it with earlier incidents,
which added to the image of a town in which anti-Semitism
was strong. Finally, we analyzed and interpreted the media
material in relation to the interviews.
Results and Analysis
An Increased Vulnerability and Vigilance
Independently of each other, most of the informants describe
and share the experience that the situation for Jews has wors-
ened in recent years.
John, now in his late 60s, was born and bred in Malmö,
and remembers how people were very quick to respond to
anti-Semitic demonstrations when he was growing up: "It
simply wasn't tolerated by society" (John, December 5,
2012). Susan, a woman in her mid-50s who has lived in
Malmö all her adult life, agrees with this and says that the
situation for Jews in Malmö has become much worse over
the last couple of years and that nowadays anti-Semitism is
much more tangible and visible (Susan, April 18, 2012).
Today, the limits have been stretched, and the general level
of acceptance of abusive language is much greater. The view
of hate crime is related to the use of language--the dis-
course--that is accepted at any given point in time (Cowan,
Resendez, Marshall, & Quist, 2002). According to several of
our informants, the acceptance of verbal anti-Semitic harass-
ment now seems to be greater than ever before. In addition,
several of the informants say that anti-Semitic feelings have
grown not only in neo-Nazi circles but also in minority
groups from the Middle East (John, December 5, 2012).
The younger informants are not sure whether the targeting
of Jews has increased in recent years, but say that awareness
of the problem and watchfulness has increased. For example,
Sara says, "My awareness has increased and I am now much,
much more vigilant in town" (May 30, 2012). The Internet is
an important source of information for those wanting to
remain informed and updated about hate crime. On the more
negative side, social forums on the Internet are a haven for
the spread of hatred (Wigerfelt, Wigerfelt, & Dahlstrand,
2015). All the younger informants are extra vigilant when
surfing the net because they never know when they might
come across an anti-Semitic website or be unexpectedly
exposed to anti-Semitic propaganda. They all share the expe-
rience of being at the receiving end of offensive comments in
social forums or being threatened, including death threats, on
social media sites such as Facebook, via email or text mes-
sages (Adam, May 30, 2012; Anna, May 30, 2012;
Christopher, June 12, 2012).
Several of the informants describe incidents that have
occurred in connection with two children's camps at a Jewish
conference center located outside Malmö. On the first occa-
sion, in 2008, a small group of young people suddenly
appeared shouting abusive insults but disappeared when the
police arrived on the scene (Susan, April 18, 2012). Two
years later, in 2010, a group of about 15 young people
appeared on the first evening of the camp shouting "Jewish
pigs," "Kill all Jews," and "Heil Hitler" outside the center.
On the following evening, the youth, aged around 14 to 15,
reappeared, and this time kicked down the fence, behaved in
a threatening manner, and threw eggs and glass bottles at the
building. The incident came as a shock to those present and,
according to one of the informants, the younger children
cried and were afraid (Filip, May 30, 2012). The perpetrators
on these occasions were local youth with "Swedish" back-
grounds, and the motives for the attacks seem to have been
anti-Semitism in connection primarily to prejudices as well
as conspiracy theories. The local school arranged a meeting
with the assailants' parents and measures were taken (John,
December 5, 2012). The quick reaction to the incident is
something that several of the informants regard as very posi-
tive and worthy of imitation (Susan, April 18, 2012; John,
December 5, 2012). The area in which the conference center
is located is one of the most prosperous in southern Sweden.
Although very few inhabitants are born outside Sweden, the
area has had problems for several years with explicit racism.
In other words, anti-Semitism is not just a phenomenon that
can be linked to segregation, outsiderhood, and the conflict
between Israel and Palestine. Its manifestations and extent
differ at different times and in diverse places.
Everyday Anti-Semitism
According to Bachner (2000), the term anti-Semitism has
become "overcharged" and often implies an intensive, open,
and action-oriented hate, as described above. However, the
connection between Nazism has resulted in a partial blind-
ness to other kinds of anti-Semitism, such as culturally deter-
mined prejudices and inherited negative attitudes. In a similar
way, Iganski (2008) argues that many hate crime incidents
Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt 7
have nothing to do with people's violent hate, but rather indi-
cate a kind of latent anti-Semitism that in many people sim-
mers below the surface. Anti-Semitism surfaces at random
and can be triggered by a conflict or everyday irritation in the
encounter with a Jewish person.
At a more everyday and subtle level, general anti-Semitic
prejudices seem to have been passed down through the gen-
erations and have spread to other circles. This anti-Semitic
prejudice can erupt in different situations, sometimes from
friends, neighbors, school- and workmates, which many of
the younger informants have experience of. Jokes and ironic
remarks about Jews are common phenomena for those we
talked to, are part of the respondent's everyday life, and
something that is almost seen as "unavoidable." As they are
impossible to predict, people are forced to be constantly on
guard. Our informants found it increasingly difficult to
accept jokes about Jews, partly because they felt more vul-
nerable now and partly because the jokes reproduced old,
classic, anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. The younger
informants told us that it can start with someone telling a
joke about Jews, which then escalates to people openly
expressing a menacing anti-Semitism, which can be seen as
an interrelated process.
As the Jewish group in Malmö is small, Jewish youth are
more vulnerable in certain situations. There is a power aspect
to this, where the number of Jews in relation to other groups
is significant. According to Ben, being a single Jew in a pub-
lic place can feel particularly vulnerable, even though many
regard Jews as part of "white Sweden": "There are so few
Jews in Malmö that people can shout whatever they want"
(Ben, May 30, 2012). Sara gave an example of meetings in
which she had been verbally attacked because she was Jewish
and where the aggression had spread to other people: "If they
are supported by 3-4 people I cannot defend myself at all. I
am outnumbered when I am alone. If I am not with my
Jewish friends then I am alone" (Sara, May 30, 2012). The
fact that the Jewish presence in Malmö is small and appears
to continue to diminish contributes to a vicious circle, where
young people who want to live a richer Jewish life move to
Stockholm or Gothenburg because the Jewish communities
are much larger there and it is possible to "keep the traditions
alive." The Jewish community thus continues to diminish,
and those who remain can experience themselves as part of a
diminishing minority and therefore more vulnerable.
Jewish Identity and Spatial Limitations
Our informants said that as Jews in Malmö they were forced
to reflect on where and in which situation their Jewish iden-
tity could or could not be exposed. Some of the informants
thought that they could choose their Jewish identity, whereas
others, like John, said that they looked like Jews on the out-
side: "Nobody could have failed to notice that I am a Jew"
(John, December 5, 2012; see also Börjesson & Palmblad,
2008).
An obvious Jewish symbol that is very uncommon in
Malmö is the headwear known as the kippah, which can be
seen as a mark of identification. The interviewees experi-
enced this as a "stigma symbol" (Goffman, 1963/2007).
Other important "stigma symbols" include Jewish jewelry/
necklaces that many are careful about wearing openly in dif-
ferent situations:
I usually wear a necklace bearing my Hebrew name. I always
wear it, but if I'm in Lund [an academic city close to Malmö] it
doesn't matter where I have it. It's always there. But if I go out
on an evening in Malmö I usually take it off. I put it in my
pocket. And if we are in Malmö on a weekday afternoon or
evening I always check where it is. If it is in front I turn it round.
(Sara, May 30, 2012)
According to Craig (2002), targeted individuals/groups
are prevented from living a "free" life. Potential victims feel
that they have to be careful and, if possible, conceal their
identity, which restricts their lives. Although Andrea (June
21, 2012) has not personally been exposed to harassment as
a result of her Jewish identity, she has heard a lot about it
from friends and relatives. These narratives have made her
much more cautious: "I don't tell everyone that I'm a Jew
because I don't want to be a target myself." Christopher is
also cautious about revealing his Jewish identity: "I don't
hide my identity but I don't tell everyone that I'm a Jew. You
have to be careful who you talk to" (Christopher, June 21,
2012).
The spatial consequences of hate crime can be that vul-
nerable groups create mental maps of a town and where it is
safe, which affects the everyday situation (Iganski & Lagou,
2009). It is clear that the informants are very conscious of
spatial limitations. The majority of hate crime takes place
around the synagogue and assembly hall in Malmö--places
where attacks have occurred and where safety measures are
in place. These are places of symbolic significance and
where hate crime is clearly against Jews as a group. The like-
lihood of being exposed to hate crime here is greater than
anywhere else. The Jewish community's rabbi, Shneur
Kesselman, is the most vulnerable and is regularly subjected
to abuse, insults, and gestures from passers-by and people
driving past in cars. Most of the reported anti-Semitic hate
crimes are directed against him. But other members of the
community also know that they need to be vigilant on their
way to or from the synagogue, because the likelihood of
being attacked is greatest there.
The Israeli­Palestinian Conflict, Its Local Imprints,
and Media Images
There was a significant increase in the reporting of hate
crime against Jews in the Swedish media, with a special
focus on Malmö, at the end of 2008/beginning of 2009,
which was largely associated with the conflict between Israel
8 SAGE Open
and Palestine. An attribute that was ascribed to Malmö was
that hate crime was increasing. This was reflected in newspa-
per headlines such as "Jewish hatred is rampant in Malmö"
(SDS, February 7, 2009) or "Jewish hatred drives them away
from Malmö" (SkD, December 12, 2012).
In 2008/2009, the conflict in Gaza escalated due to the
Israeli military operation known as Cast Lead. In Sweden,
Jews began to feel threatened. The Council of Swedish Jewish
Communities wrote to the Swedish Government to ask for
help in stopping an increasing threat toward Jews in Sweden.
The background to the letter was that threats, violent actions,
and arson attacks had been directed at Jews and Jewish insti-
tutions (Dagen, February 4, 2009). The worsening situation
on the Gaza Strip had local imprints. In Malmö, a Jewish net-
work/association organized a demonstration demanding
Israel's right to exist, which ended in chaos with demonstra-
tors being pelted with stones and eggs. Some of the demon-
strators were reported to have shouted "fucking Jews" and
"Heil Hitler." The police were unable to guarantee safety and
security, and many people, including Jews, sought shelter in
the streets and alleys adjoining the square (Dagen, February
4, 2009). This incident--an important key incident in the
media images of Malmö as a city especially characterized by
anti-Semitic hate crime--was reported in both the national
and international media. In the weeks and months following
this turbulent demonstration, Jews experienced an escalation
in the number of harassments. In an interview, a spokesperson
from the Jewish community described the incident as a kind
of collective trauma for its members, and perhaps also for the
inhabitants of Malmö (SkD, January 27, 2010).
In March 2009, shortly after Cast Lead and the demon-
stration described above, the city of Malmö hosted a Davis
Cup tennis match between Sweden and Israel. Due to the
turbulent nature of the demonstration, the increase in reported
anti-Semitic hate crimes and lobbying by anti-Israel groups,
the police decided that the match should be played privately
and not be open to the public. This decision resulted in a
polarized and heated debate, both nationally and internation-
ally. For example, the Israeli media accused Sweden, and
specifically Malmö, of anti-Semitism (Nordvästra Skånes
Tidningar [NST], December 7, 2012). This can also be seen
as yet another so-called key incident that recurs in both the
informants' narratives and media reports.
Without exception, the informants living in Malmö stress
that they all are affected by the Israel­Palestine conflict but that
over the years they have developed strategies to cope with it.
They emphasize the importance of being informed about what
is happening in Israel and do this by reading daily updates on
the Internet, accessing information via Facebook, from friends
living in Israel, and so on.All our informants in Malmö experi-
ence a clear connection between increased anti-Semitic harass-
ment and open conflicts between Israelis and Palestinians.
They feel themselves to be held collectively accountable for
the events in the Middle East. Sara said that she and other Jews
were held responsible for what happened in Israel:
When anything happens people don't distinguish between Israel
and us. The conclusion is that Israel plus Jews equals one. But it
isn't. I can't be held responsible for a whole country's actions. I
have to stand up for my own actions. (May 30, 2012)
Over the years, Susan has learned that certain subjects are
charged and no longer gets involved in discussions about, for
example, circumcision, or the Israel­Palestine conflict, at her
place of work. The discomfort increases when the situation
in Israel heats up:
What I have come up against and is very unpleasant is at work
when something happens in Israel. It's discussed at work and it
feels as though I have to shoulder the blame for everything that
happens there. I make a hasty retreat. I've learned not to get
involved in such discussions. (Susan, April 18, 2012)
Petra said something similar in another interview:
You are singled out as guilty. "Why are YOU firing missiles?"
And then you hear on the radio that of course they don't like
Jews here in Sweden because they murder their families in the
Middle East. I get so very angry. What have we, I am 16 years
old, done? Have I shot someone there? They see us as a group
and mix it up with the state of Israel. They don't see us as
individuals. (June 21, 2012)
Ben thought that it was people from different backgrounds
who hurled insults, although in the main it was people from
the Middle East:
At school there are also Swedes (who insult us), but in the main
it's people from the Middle East. It's not just Palestinians, but
others too. Some may have friends who are Palestinians. (May
30, 2012)
Students with a Middle Eastern background attend many of
Malmö's schools. Some informants told us that their children
have been exposed to hate crime incidents initiated by some of
these students. As a result, many Jewish families have chosen
to send their children to schools where there seems to be less
risk of them being targeted. Jewish teachers also talked about
their vulnerability in school, which in some cases has led to
teachers leaving the profession due to harassment and threats.
Anti-Semitism and Segregation
According to Bachner and Ring (2005), the anti-Semitism
that is evident in certain Muslim groups in Europe is sus-
tained by the Israel­Palestine conflict but is probably also
fueled by the social and economic marginalization and outsi-
derhood that characterizes many of the migrant groups in
Europe (see also Bergmann & Wetzel, 2003; Taguieff, 2004).
Several of the informants point to the city's increased segre-
gation as an explanation for why Jews feel more exposed in
Malmö than in other parts of the country (John, December 5,
2012; Petur, July 19, 2014). Susan reasons in a similar way
Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt 9
and thinks that the most important factor for Malmö in com-
bating anti-Semitism is to invest in a good integration policy.
In this, she points to the major schisms in the city, where
many people are unemployed and live in socially vulnerable
areas (April 18, 2012).
Sophia is a Jewish woman in her late 30s. She lives in
Malmö but was born and brought up in a small village out-
side the city. For several years, and especially in connection
with the intensification of the conflict between Israel and
Palestine, she has been repeatedly harassed; an experience
that began when she moved to Malmö. For more than a
decade, she has lived in a segregated area that is populated
by a large number of people from different parts of the
Middle East, where it is well known that she and her friend
have a Jewish background. She has experienced harassment
in her everyday life. For her, taking the dog out for a walk
and going to the supermarket are everyday situations in
which she is constantly exposed to physical and verbal
harassment.
Both the woman with whom I share a flat and I have had stones
thrown at our heads. My friend even had a mug of urine thrown
over her from an upstairs balcony. . . . I have been called a
"fucking Jew," a "Jewish whore" and a "Jewish cunt." (Sophia,
May 28, 2013)
One experience that was particularly painful and upset-
ting for Sophia was a late-night burglary in her home. When
she realized that the things that were missing were sacred
Jewish artifacts of great sentimental value, she connected the
theft with anti-Semitism. Attacks like these have affected
both women's health--especially psychologically--and
restricted their movements, to the extent that they are now
afraid to leave their home and mix with other people.
The effects of hate crime go beyond the immediate vic-
tim. Others in the same group who hear or read about the hate
crime can react angrily and/or with fear (see, for example,
Boeckmann & Turpin-Petrosino, 2002; Craig, 2002; Craig-
Henderson, 2009; Wachtel, 1999). Several of our informants
said that they felt vulnerable as Jews even when something
happened in other places:
When something happens that is directed at Jews in other places
the tension increases, because the threat is always there. We are
always vigilant and this affects us a lot, especially when the
threat is real. We can't "keep looking over our shoulder" but
have to try to live a normal everyday life. (Judith, March 22,
2012)
The Media Images of an "Anti-Semitic City"
The Jewish community's rabbi became something of an "offi-
cial face" and "object" for the anti-Semitism manifested in
Malmö. Rabbi Shneur Kesselman, clearly identifiable as a
Jew with his black clothes and long beard, has talked about
his vulnerability in Malmö in several newspaper interviews.
Kesselman's appearance singles him out as especially
exposed. He describes being spat at on the street, having soft
drink cans thrown at him while walking through the streets
and almost being run over by a passing car. The rabbi usually
reports most of the hate crime incidents he is involved in to
the police. As yet, none of the reported incidents have led to
any legal action being taken (Dagen, February 4, 2009;
Dagens Nyheter [DN], November 7, 2011; KvP, March 5,
2010; KvP, October 28, 2011; KvP, April 24, 2012; SDS,
February 7, 2009; SDS, July 17, 2011).
What about our rabbi? He looks like a Jew. He walks around
town and is harassed, spat at or whatever. But imagine if we'd
all looked like him! Would we be able to live here at all? I don't
understand it. He hasn't even done anything. He's not even from
Israel. He's from the USA. (Petra, June 21, 2012)
Ilmar Reepalu, the former mayor of Malmö, who has
received a lot of negative attention in the debate on anti-Semi-
tism and has been accused of anti-Semitic rhetoric in his public
utterances about Jews living in the city, can also be seen as an
"object" with negative attributes in the media descriptions of
Malmö as an anti-Semitic city. For example, Reepalu has said
that Jews in Malmö ought to distance themselves from Israel's
actions. This has been criticized and discussed in the media by
politicians and other actors. Reepalu has thus become an offi-
cial representative of Malmö, and his utterances have contrib-
uted to headlines such as "Hate of Jews is greatest in Malmö"
(Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå [TT], January 29, 2010).
Reepalu's statements have also been strongly criticized in the
local press (SDS, September 29, 2012), as exemplified by the
headline: "Reepalu is the Problem" (SDS, September 30,
2012). Reepalu's statements have been reproduced and dis-
cussed in several newspaper debate articles and have been
taken up in contexts in which Malmö is described as a city
characterized by anti-Semitism. Reepalu has come to personify
the critique that government agencies and politicians do not do
enough to combat and stand up to anti-Semitism.
A consequence of the key incidents described above and
one's own and others' experiences of harassment is that
many Jewish families have moved away from Malmö.
According to both the media and our interviews, it is clear
that some Jewish families have decided to leave Malmö in
the hope of finding a better life elsewhere. Some families
have even talked openly to the press about why they want to
move. In one newspaper article, a family was interviewed
about why they wanted to move from Malmö to Israel. The
main reason that was given was an increasing anti-Semitism.
"My children are not safe here. It will only get worse," said
the man in the family. Some of his relatives have lived in
Malmö since the beginning of the 1800s, while others who
had survived the extermination camps came in 1945. The
man said that people had shouted "fucking Jew" at him, and
he had witnessed how his friend had been seriously violated
and threatened. He said that if someone shouts "Kill the
10 SAGE Open
Jews," it also affects him and pierces his heart. The man did
not know of anyone who dared to wear visible signs of
Judaism, such as the Star of David or the kippah. He was
critical of those in power in Malmö, and thought that they did
not openly distance themselves from anti-Semitism (SkD,
January 25, 2010). In an interview, one of the informants said
that it was not only anti-Semitic hate crime that made fami-
lies leave Malmö but also dissatisfaction with politicians
who did not take the problem seriously. If they had, the fami-
lies might have stayed (Eva, September 25, 2012).
In 2014, the conflict between Israel and Palestine flared
up yet again in Gaza, which in Malmö meant that anti-Semi-
tism was refueled and used by certain individuals to activate
hostility toward Jews and Jewish symbols/buildings.
Windows were smashed in the synagogue, and at one point
five people shouting anti-Semitic slogans tried to force their
way into the Jewish assembly hall next to the synagogue
(SDS, August 3, 2014). The rabbi was attacked twice in the
same day. On the first occasion, a bottle was thrown at him
and on the second a cigarette lighter. A man shouted "Jewish
pig" and other derogatory words at the rabbi (SDS, August 5,
2014).
Final Discussion
The reporting of anti-Semitic hate crime has increased in
Europe as a whole in recent years. This anti-Semitic current
has also affected Sweden, where the city of Malmö has been
highlighted by the media and by the Simon Wiesenthal
Centre as a dangerous city for people with a Jewish identity.
Our examination of the Swedish media's reporting of anti-
Semitic hate crime incidents shows that in recent years the
focus on Malmö and some of the key incidents that have
taken place there has increased. An attribute that is ascribed
to anti-Semitic hate crime in Malmö is the city's unique posi-
tion in Sweden. Objects like anti-Semitism, hate crime, and
Malmö's politicians serve as nodes that are interconnected
with other nodes and key incidents. The links between the
different nodes are both cognitive and affective, in that they
deal with which objects are associated with and how one
feels about the links. In short, the more the media reports on
Malmö and anti-Semitic hate crime, the more likely we are to
connect the city with this.Also, the more often certain objects
or attributes are highlighted in the media, the more often
these objects are activated and attributed in our minds (prim-
ing) and the more likely we are to think about these particular
objects or attributes.
The events described above have been intertextually
repeated in other parts of Sweden's media and have contrib-
uted to a view of Malmö as the bastion of anti-Semitism; a
stigmatization that the city finds difficult to shake off. This
has also had international repercussions. The effect of this
could be that anti-Semitic incidents in other places are
ignored. The fear that is spread by the media is reinforced
and accumulated by the so-called key incidents that many of
the informants themselves, or their friends and relatives,
have been exposed to. The key incidents that are particularly
highlighted are harassment and threats in connection with
demonstrations; for example, Jews being chased on the
street, hate crimes committed against the rabbi, attacks on
youth camps, and teachers and children with a Jewish iden-
tity being harassed at school--events that are distressing and
confirm increased vulnerability. There is great disappoint-
ment among the informants that politicians and government
agencies do not intervene forcefully enough.
The majority of the informants think that they have been
collectively blamed for the situation in the Middle East, to the
extent that has become more difficult to be a "visible" Jew in
Malmö. This is most obvious in the case of the rabbi in Malmö,
but in Sophia's story it is also clear that she and her friend are
singled out as Jews in their neighborhood. The stories also
show that Jews in other cities are forced to adjust to a kind of
latent threat that tends to increase when the conflict between
Israel and Palestine escalates. Some of the informants connect
the perpetrators of hate crime with young men from the Middle
East who mainly act when the conflict between Israel and
Palestine is at its most acute. The presence of large population
groups from the Middle East in relation to the small Jewish
minority can lead to feelings of insecurity. Many point out that
Malmö is a socially vulnerable and segregated city, and that it
is also relatively compact, where encounters between people
take place in a more direct way than in larger cities, for exam-
ple, Stockholm, with its large geographic spread and suburbs
some distance from the center.
However, the informants' stories also reveal a more com-
plex picture of who the perpetrators are. One example of this
is the prosperous area outside Malmö where Jewish children
and young people are confronted by extreme right-wing Nazi
slogans from local young people. The stories about anti-
Semitic prejudices and stereotypes of friends, neighbors, and
colleagues who are Jews indicate another, more widespread,
abuse. For several of the informants, everyday anti-Semitism
is very distressing. Iganski (2008) argues that most anti-Jew-
ish incidents are what are sometimes called commonplace
incidents--a kind of latent anti-Semitism that becomes man-
ifest when the opportunity to ventilate prejudices presents
itself and is triggered by simple schisms. It is often difficult
to judge when an anti-Semitic hate crime starts and ends,
because it is an ongoing process with a cumulative effect
(Bowling, 1999).
The situation of Jews in Malmö has changed, and many
experience that openly revealing their Jewish affinity is prob-
lematic due to the latent threats. Jewish symbols are often
spontaneously hidden and, even if one has not been person-
ally affected, there is concern and deliberation about where
and when one's Jewish identity can be revealed. The syna-
gogue, the Jewish community's premises, and the Jewish
cemetery are obvious material symbols for the Jewish group
and are targets for hate crime attacks. As a Jew, one is forced
to be extra careful around these areas and be constantly on
Wigerfelt and Wigerfelt 11
guard. The consequences for the individual can be very seri-
ous. Restrictions in how one lives one's life also affect the
entire group (Iganski, 2008; McDevitt, Balboni, Garcia, &
Gu, 2003). When someone is affected by hate crime incidents,
the entire Jewish group is affected. Anti-Semitic acts can also
be described as "message crimes," in that they announce to
the victim's group that they can also become targets
(Lawrence, 2003). Doubts as to whether society can protect
and support these members and the feeling of abandonment
are some of the reasons as to why hate crime is seen as worse
than crimes that are not motivated by hate crime (see also
Tiby, 2009). It is therefore very important that hate crime is
explicitly condemned by leading politicians and government
agencies, and that special measures are introduced.

Notes
1. Swedish legislation relating to hate crime and stiffer penalties
is based on the motives of the perpetrator in a criminal action.
The ruling about harsher sentences was introduced in Sweden
in 1994 for crimes committed against a person, ethnic group,
or other groups of people on the grounds of race, skin color,
national or ethnic origin, faith, sexual orientation, or other sim-
ilar circumstances (The Swedish Penal Code Ch. 29 2 §7 p).
2. Some scholars argue that the term "new anti-Semitism" is part
of an increasing Islamophobia (Fekete, 2012), or that in any
case Jews in general are seen as a less exposed group than
most other minorities in the West (Kushner, 2013; Lerman,
2003).
