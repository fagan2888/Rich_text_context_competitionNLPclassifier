walking speed, has been shown to be as-

to determine the degree to which gait

ter accounting for age and sex.
METHODS
Overview
We used individual participant data
from 9 cohort studies, baseline data for
which were collected between 1986 and
2000 (TABLE 1).8,15,16,18-23 Each study,
which included more than 400 older
adults with gait speed data at baseline,
monitored survival for at least 5 years.
Analyses performed herein were con-
ducted in 2009 and 2010. All studies
required written informed consent and
institutional review board approval.
Populations
All studies recruited community-
dwelling older adults. Although some
sought representative samples,8,15,20,23
others focused on healthier partici-
pants,16,17 single sex,19,22 or older adults
from primary care practices.21 Only

Context Survival estimates help individualize goals of care for geriatric patients, but
life tables fail to account for the great variability in survival. Physical performance mea-
sures, such as gait speed, might help account for variability, allowing clinicians to make
more individualized estimates.
Objective To evaluate the relationship between gait speed and survival.
Design, Setting, and Participants Pooled analysis of 9 cohort studies (collected
between 1986 and 2000), using individual data from 34 485 community-dwelling older
adults aged 65 years or older with baseline gait speed data, followed up for 6 to 21
years. Participants were a mean (SD) age of 73.5 (5.9) years; 59.6%, women; and
79.8%, white; and had a mean (SD) gait speed of 0.92 (0.27) m/s.
Main Outcome Measures Survival rates and life expectancy.
Results There were 17 528 deaths; the overall 5-year survival rate was 84.8% (confi-
denceinterval[CI],79.6%-88.8%)and10-yearsurvivalratewas59.7%(95%CI,46.5%-
70.6%). Gait speed was associated with survival in all studies (pooled hazard ratio per 0.1
m/s, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.87-0.90; P.001). Survival increased across the full range of gait
speeds,withsignificantincrementsper0.1m/s.Atage75,predicted10-yearsurvivalacross

Measures
Gait speed was calculated for each par-
ticipant using distance in meters and
timeinseconds.Allstudiesusedinstruc-
tions to walk at usual pace and from a
standingstart.Thewalkdistancevaried
from 8 ft to 6 m. For 8 ft, we converted
to 4-m gait speed by formula.24 For 6 m,
we created a conversion formula (4-m
speed=-0.0341(6-mspeed)0.9816
withR2=0.93,basedonacohortof61in-
dividuals with concurrent 4- and 6-m
walks).For15feet(4.57m),23 speedwas
simply meters divided by time. Where

for more than 99% of participants.
Additional variables include sex, age,
race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic,
other,definedbyparticipant),height(cen-
timeters),weight(kilograms),bodymass
index (BMI), calculated as weight in ki-
lograms divided by height in meters
squared (25, 25-30, and 30), smok-
ing (never, past, current), use of mobil-
ityaids(none,cane,walker),systolicblood

pitalizationinthepastyear(yes/no),and

category.29 Forgraphicalpurposes,gait
speed was categorized into 0.2-m/s in-
crementswithlowerandupperextremes
being grouped as less than 0.4 m/s and
higher than 1.4 m/s.
Cox proportional hazards regres-
sion models were used to assess asso-
ciations between gait speed and sur-
vival, adjusting for age at baseline, for
which hazard ratios (HRs) correspond
to a 0.1-m/s difference in gait speed.
The analyses were repeated adjusting
for height, sex, race, BMI, smoking
history systolic blood pressure, dis-
eases, prior hospitalization, and self-
reported heath. Proportionality of
hazards was verified by examining
Schoenfeld residual plots.30 Appropri-
ateness of using gait speed as a con-
tinuous predictor was confirmed by ob-
serving linearity in Cox models with
ordered 0.2-m/s gait speed categories.
To examine the influence of early
deaths, we repeated analyses exclud-
ing deaths within 1 year of gait speed
measurement and moved up the 0 time
for survival assessment (results were
similar; eTable 1 available at http://www
.jama.com). Subgroup analyses were re-
peated in strata by age (65-74, 75-84,
or 85 years), sex, race, self-reported
health status, smoking history, BMI,
functional status, use of mobility aids,
and hospitalization and by report of
cancer, arthritis, diabetes, and heart dis-
ease.29 Results were pooled across sex
because no substantial sex differences
existed in HRs within subgroup strata.
To obtain simple and clinically us-
able estimates of survival probability
based on sex, age, and gait speed, we fit
logistic regression models separately for
each sex with dichotomized 5- and 10-
yearsurvivalastheresponsevariableand
age, gait speed, and their interaction as
continuous predictors. To obtain esti-
matesofmediansurvival(furtherlifeex-

candidate variables and to determine
whether gait speed improves predictive
accuracy beyond other clinical mea-
sures, we fit logistic regression models
withdichotomized5-yearor10-yearsur-
vival as the response variable and vari-
ous combinations of predictors as inde-

a total of 34 485 participants (Table 1).
Althoughmoststudiesincludedmenand
women, 2 were sex specific.19,22 Of the
total, 59.6% were women. There were
substantialnumbersofAfricanAmerican
(n=3852) and Hispanic (n=2650) par-
ticipants. The studies had a wide age
range, including 1765 persons older
than85years.Similarly,therewasawide
range of gait speeds, from less than 0.4
m/s (n=1247) to more than 1.4 m/s
(n=1491).Studyfollow-uptimeranged
from6.0to21.0years,withparticipants
followedupforameanof12.2andame-
dianof13.8years.Therewere17528total
deathsacrossallstudies,withratesvary-
ingfrom18.40%to91.87%inindividual
studies. Mortality rates appear to be re-
lated to length of follow-up (Table 1).
To assess consistency across studies,
risk of death was estimated per 0.1-m/s
higher gait speed. Age-adjusted HRs by
study ranged from 0.83 to 0.94 and all
weresignificant(P.001;FIGURE1).We
also examined the survival HRs for gait
speedbystudyinsubgroups,including
age, sex, race/ethnicity, BMI, smoking
history, use of mobility aids, prior hos-
pitalization,self-reportedhealth,func-
tional status, and selected chronic dis-
eases.Therewereconsistentassociations
acrossstudies,althoughgiventhelarge
samplesizes,Qstatisticswereoftensta-
tisticallysignificant(detailsavailablein
eFigure 1A-M available at http://www
.jama.com). For the 3 levels of func-
tional status (independent, difficulty
with instrumental ADLs, and depen-
dent in ADLs), the pooled HR per 0.1-
m/s increase in gait speed for those who
were independent was 0.92 (P=.005),
for those with difficulty in instrumen-
tal activities was also 0.92 (P.001) but
was 0.94 (P=.02) among those depen-
dent in ADLs. Because physical activ-
ity measures were not sufficiently con-
sistent across studies, effects could not
be pooled. The Osteoporotic Frac-
tures in Men (MrOS)19 and Hispanic Es-
tablished Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE)8
used the Physical Activity Scale for the
Elderly (PASE). When dichotomized at
a score of 100 into low and high activ-
ity, MrOS had consistent and statisti-
cally significant HRs for low (HR, 0.85;
95% CI, 0.81-0.88) and high (HR, 0.87;
95% CI, 0.84-0.90) physical activity. In
the Hispanic EPESE, the HR for low
physical activity was significant (0.92;
95% CI, 0.88-0.96) but the HR for
higher physical activity was not (0.99;
95% CI, 0.95-1.04).Pooled HRs for all
subgroups except functional status were
consistently in the range of 0.81 to 0.92
and all were significant (P.002).
The overall HR for survival per each
0.1 m/s faster gait speed was 0.88 (95%

across all studies using a random-
effects meta-analytic statistical ap-
proach (Figure 1 and eFigure 1 avail-
able at http://www.jama.com). Further
adjustment for sex, BMI, smoking sta-
tus, systolic blood pressure, diseases,
prior hospitalization, and self-reported
health did not change the results (over-
all HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.89-0.91;
P.001).Usingdatafromallstudies,we
created for each sex, 5- and 10-year sur-
vival tables (TABLE 2, data derived from
pooled Kaplan-Meier estimates evalu-
ated at 5 and 10 years, presented in 3 age
groups) and graphs (eFigure 3 and eFig-
ure 4 predicted survival based on pooled
logistic regression coefficients, data pre-
sented with age as a continuous vari-
able).Gaitspeedwasassociatedwithdif-
ferences in the probability of survival at
all ages in both sexes, but was espe-
cially informative after age 75 years. In
men, the probability of 5-year survival
at age 85 ranged from 0.3 to 0.88 (eFig-
ure 3A) and the probability of 10-year
survivalatage75yearsrangedfrom0.18
to 0.86 (eFigure 4A). In women, the
probability of 5-year survival remained
greaterthan0.5untiladvancedage(eFig-
ure 3B), but 10-year survival at age 75
yearsrangedfrom0.34to0.92andatage
80 years from 0.22 to 0.86 (eFigure 4B).
Stratification by sex-specific median

not stratified by height. Stratification by
race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
black, Hispanic) suggested generally
similarsurvivalratesbygaitspeedamong
age and sex groups. Confidence inter-
vals were often wide. In some subsets of
slow walkers of Hispanic descent, sur-
vival rates were 10% to 20% higher than
in other groups (eTable 2).

3 age groups.) In the pooled sample,
median survival in years for the age
groups 65 through 74 years was 12.6
for men and 16.8 for women; for 75
through 84 years, 7.9 for men and 10.5
for women; and for 85 years or older,
4.6 for men and 6.4 years for women
(eTable 3 available at http://www.jama
.com). Predicted years of remaining life
for each sex and age increased as gait
speed increased, with a gait speed of
about 0.8 m/s at the median life expec-
tancy at most ages for both sexes
(Figure 2; a PDF of enlarged graphs is
available at http://www.jama.com). Gait
speeds of 1.0 m/s or higher consis-
tently demonstrated survival that was
longer than expected by age and sex
alone. In this older adult population,
the relationship of gait speed with re-
maining years of life was consistent
across age groups, but the absolute
number of expected remaining years of
life was larger at younger ages. For 70-
year-old men, life expectancy ranged
from 7 to 23 years and for women, from
10 to 30 years.

aFunctional status was operationally defined for 3 levels: (1) activities of daily living (ADLs) dependence is defined as report of needing help from another person or being unable to perform
any of 6 basic ADLs, 2) Instrumental ADL difficulty is defined as report of no ADL dependence but difficulty performing shopping, meal preparation, or heavy housework, and (3) In-
dependent is defined as no report of ADL dependence or instrumental ADL difficulty.
bValue is the pooled estimate of the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for age, sex, and gait speed for the studies that were used in the comparisons of gait speed with
use of mobility aids and functional status. Four studies were included in the estimates of 5 y mortality and three in the estimates of 10 y mortality. Values are reported as the C statistic
representing area under the receiver operator characteristic curve; values that differ by 0.025 or more are considered substantially different.37
cC statistic is greater than for age and sex alone.

In addition, we used C statistics to as-
sess the ability of usual gait speed to pre-
dictsurvivalcomparedwithotherphysi-
cal performance measures, such as fast
gait speed and the Short Physical Per-
formance Battery (SPPB), a brief mea-
sure that includes walk speed, chair rise
ability, and balance. We assessed usual

not have an advantage in survival pre-

Walkingrequiresenergy,movementcon-
trol,andsupportandplacesdemandson
multiple organ systems, including the
heart, lungs, circulatory, nervous, and
musculoskeletalsystems.Slowinggaitmay
reflectbothdamagedsystemsandahigh-
energy cost of walking.13,39-54 Gait speed
could be considered a simple and acces-
siblesummaryindicatorofvitalitybecause
itintegratesknownandunrecognizeddis-
turbancesinmultipleorgansystems,many
of which affect survival. In addition, de-
creasing mobility may induce a vicious
cycleofreducedphysicalactivityandde-
conditioning that has a direct effect on
health and survival.6
The association between gait speed
and survival is known.6,7,9-12,55,56 Prior
analyses used single cohorts and pre-
sented results as relative rather than ab-
solute risk, as done herein. Similarly,
mortality prediction models have been
developed.3-5,57-60 Some models use self-
reported information but others also in-
cludephysiologicalorperformancedata,
for a total of 4 to more than 10 predic-
tive factors. Only a few models assess
overall predictive capacity using C sta-
tistics; the reported values are in the
range found in the present study (pub-
lished area under the curve range, 0.66-
0.8261 vs this study, 0.717 and 0.737).

were too small to assess potential effect

tationsofobservationalresearch;itcan-
not establish causal relationships and is
vulnerable to various forms of healthy
volunteer bias. The participating study
cohorts, while large and diverse, do not
represent the universe of possible data.
Oursurvivalestimatesshouldbevalidated

studies was based in clinical practice,21
and advanced dementia is rare in popu-

remain in the use of self-report as well,
such as choice of items and reliability,
someofwhichcanbeaddressedbyemerg-
ing techniques such as computer adap-

gest that gait speed appears to be espe-
cially informative in older persons who

It would be valuable to further charac-
terize this subgroup.
Although the gait speed­survival re-
lationship seems continuous across the
entire range, cut points may help inter-
pretation.Severalauthorshaveproposed
that gait speeds faster than 1.0 m/s sug-
gest healthier aging while gait speeds
slower than 0.6 m/s increase the likeli-
hoodofpoorhealthandfunction.7,21 Oth-

How might gait speed be used clini-
cally? First, gait speed might help iden-
tify older adults with a high probability
oflivingfor5or10moreyears,whomay
be appropriate targets for preventive in-
terventionsthatrequireyearsforbenefit.
Second,gaitspeedmightbeusedtoiden-

promotecommunication.Primaryclini-
ciansmightcharacterizeanolderadultas
likely to be in poor health and function
because the gait speed is 0.5 m/s. In re-
search manuscripts, baseline gait speed
might help to characterize the overall
health of older research participants.
Fourth, gait speed might be monitored

The data provided herein are in-
tendedtoaidclinicians,investigators,and
health system planners who seek simple
indicators of health and survival in older
adults. Gait speed has potential to be
implemented in practice, using a stop
watch and a 4-m course. From a stand-
ing start, individuals are instructed to
walk at their usual pace, as if they were
walking down the street, and given no
further encouragement or instructions.
Thedatainthisarticlecanbeusedtohelp
interpret the results. Gait speed may be
a simple and accessible indicator of the
health of the older person.
