Abstract
Objective: To investigate the prevalence and implication of cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily
C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) variants and vitamin K epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1 (VKORC1)-
1639 G > A polymorphisms in Chinese patients receiving warfarin therapy.
Methods: Chinese Han patients requiring oral warfarin therapy were consecutively enrolled.
Correlations between CYP2C9*1, *2, *3, *4, *5 variants and VKORC1-1639 G > A polymorphisms,
fourth-day international normalized ratios (INRs) and warfarin maintenance dose were
investigated.
Results: Out of 101 patients, there were no significant differences in fourth-day INR or warfarin
daily maintenance doses between patients with CYP2C9*1*1 and CYP2C9*1*3 genotypes. Patients
with the VKORC1-1639 AA genotype had a higher fourth-day INR (1.87 Æ 0.14) than those with the
VKORC1-1639 AG genotype (1.32 Æ 0.15). Warfarin maintenance dose for patients with
the VKORC1-1639 AA genotype (2.40 Æ 0.70 mg/day) was significantly lower than for patients
with the VKORC1-1639 AG genotype (4.83 Æ 0.70 mg/day).
Conclusions: Unlike Caucasian populations, VKORC1-1639 G > A polymorphisms in the Chinese
population may be the dominant genetic factors associated with warfarin response variability.

Introduction
Warfarin is the most widely prescribed anti-
coagulant drug for the prophylaxis and
treatment of patients with venous and
arterial thromboembolic disorders.1
Management of warfarin therapy is prob-
lematic, however, for a number of reasons:
first, since it has a narrow therapeutic index,
frequent assessment of blood prothrombin
time using the standardized international
normalized ratio (INR) is essential to
decrease the risk of bleeding, which is the
most common and dangerous warfarin-
related complication;2,3 secondly, patients
exhibit large interindividual and interethnic
variability in dose response to the anticoagu-
lant effects;4 thirdly, there are no fixed doses
in relation to warfarin treatment, as dose
requirements are affected by the patients'
weight, diet, age, disease state, concomitant
use of other medications and genetic
factors.5
Cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C,
polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) and vitamin K
epoxide reductase complex, subunit 1
(VKORC1) are the two most important
enzymes in the pharmacokinetic and phar-
macodynamic pathways of warfarin.6­11
Compared with the wild type, variants in
the genes encoding these proteins have
shown impaired metabolic capacity to
warfarin.12
The aim of the present study was to
investigate variants of CYP2C9, and
VKORC1-1639G > A promoter polymorph-
isms in Chinese patients with different indi-
cations for warfarin therapy, to evaluate the
contribution of genetic factors combined
with demographic factors to warfarin dose
variability.
Patients and methods
Study population
Chinese Han patients attending Peking
University First Hospital, Beijing, China,
between November 2009 and March 2011,
were sequentially enrolled. Indications for
warfarin treatment comprised atrial
Ebrillation, valve replacement, pulmonary
embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke and
atrial flutter. Exclusion criteria included
concurrent use of drugs known to interfere
with warfarin, impaired hepatic function or
renal function, thyroid disease, malignancy
or history of radiation therapy, and age <18
years. The target range for the INR was 1.8­
3.0. The initial loading dose of warfarin was
3 mg per day for the first 3 consecutive days.
The first INR was determined on the fourth
day of treatment and subsequently twice a
week, and the dose was adjusted according
to the findings. Complete warfarin dosing
information was retrieved from medical
records to determine the warfarin mainten-
ance dose, defined as the dose relating to the
average of three INR measurements within
the target range over a minimum period of 4
weeks. Demographic data including sex,
age, weight and height were recorded, in
addition to indications for warfarin therapy,
concomitant diseases, and concurrent medi-
cations. An antecubital venous blood
sample (4 ml) was taken from each patient
on arrival at the clinic. Blood samples were
immediately transferred to the laboratory

and stored at À20C prior to DNA
extraction.

Committee approved the study, and all
participants provided written informed
consent.
Genotyping VKORC1-1639G > A and
CYP2C9 variants
Genomic DNA was isolated from blood
leukocytes using the Wizard Genomic DNA
purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI)
according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
The VKORC1-1639 G > A polymorph-
isms were detected using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) followed by digestion with
the restriction enzyme Msp1 (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). PCR was performed
using a commercially available kit (PCR
MagiMix 2.0, Tiandz, Beijing, China)
including 1 ml (38 ng) genomic DNA and 1
U AmpliTaqÕ DNA polymerase, in a final
reaction volume of 25 ml, with the following
primers: forward, 50-GCCAGCAGGAGA
GGGAAATA-30 and reverse, 50-AGTTTG
GACCTACAGGTGCCT-3; the molar con-
centration of the primer pairs was 10 mmol/l.
Thermal cycling conditions (Mastercycler
Pro, Eppendorf AG, Germany) comprised
an initial denaturation at 94C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at
94C for 30 s, annealing at 58C for 30 s and
elongation at 72C for 30 s, with a final
extension period at 72C for 10 min. 10 ml of
PCR product was digested with 0.3 ml of
restriction enzyme Msp1 (made up to 20 ml
with deionized water) for 2 h at 37C. The
290 base-pair (bp) products were separated
on 2.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under UV light.
The CYP2C9 variants were analysed
using primers designed with Primer
Premier software, version 3.0 (Premier
Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA,
USA). The CYP2C9*2 allele was detected
using PCR followed by digestion with the
restriction enzyme AvaII (Promega). PCR
was performed in a 25 -ml final reaction
volume comprising 1.5 mM MgCl2
, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM dNTPs, 1 U
AmpliTaqÕ DNA polymerase (Beijing
Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China) and
$100 ng of human genomic DNA, using
0.32 mM each of the following primer pairs:
forward, 50-TGCCTGTTTCAGCATCTGT
C-30 and reverse, 50-CCCCTGAAATGTTT
CCAAGA-30. AmpliEcation conditions
comprised an initial denaturation at 94C
for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denatur-
ation at 94C for 30 s, annealing at 58C for
30 s and elongation at 72C for 30 s, fol-
lowed by a final extension period at 72C for
10 min. Following PCR, 10-ml aliquots of
PCR product were incubated at 37C for
2.5 h with 2.4 U of AvaII. Digested products
(258 bp and 129 bp) were then separated by
electrophoresis using a 2.5% agarose gel,
stained with ethidium bromide and visua-
lized under UV light.
The CYP2C9*3, *4, and *5 alleles were
detected using DNA sequencing. PCR was
performed in a 50 -ml final reaction volume
comprising 1.5 mM MgCl2
, 5 mM Tris-HCl,
50 mM KCl, 10 mM dNTPs, 1 U of
AmpliTaqÕ DNA polymerase (Beijing
Transgen Biotech) and 100 ng human gen-
omic DNA, using 2.5 ml each of the follow-
ing primer pairs: forward, 50-GAACGTG
TGATTGGCAGAAA-30 and reverse, 50-T
CGAAAACATGGAGTTGCAG-30; the
molar concentration of the primer pairs
was 10 mmol/l. AmpliEcation conditions
comprised an initial denaturation at 94C
for 5 min, followed by 35 PCR cycles of
denaturation at 94C for 30 s, annealing at
54C for 30 s, and elongation at 72C for
30 s, followed by a final extension period at
72C for 10 min. DNA sequencing was
performed using an ABI PRISMÕ 310
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA, USA) according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Statistical analyses
Allele frequencies were estimated by gene
counting. Departure from Hardy­Weinberg
equilibrium was tested using 2-test with one
degree of freedom. 2-test and the paired
t-test were used to compare the genotype
frequencies of each single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) within the study popula-
tion. Differences in sex, age, height and
weight between each CYP2C9 and
VKORC1 genotype were compared with
2-test or paired t-test as appropriate.
Fourth-day INRs and warfarin mainten-
ance dose were compared between the dif-
ferent genotypes using two-sample t-test or
Mann­Whitney U-test as appropriate.
Associations between fourth-day INR and
age, sex, weight or height were evaluated
using Spearman's rank correlation coeffi-
cient test. Stepwise regression analysis was
used to investigate factors contributing to
the fourth-day INR and warfarin mainten-
ance dose. Data were presented as n (%),
median (range) or mean Æ SD unless other-
wise stated. All statistical analyses were
performed using the SPSSÕ software pack-
age, version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. A P-value < 0.05 was
regarded as statistically significant.
Results
Patient demographics and genotype
A total of 101 Chinese Han patients were
included in this study (Table 1). Genotype
distribution is presented in Table 2. The
frequencies of the alleles were as follows:
VKORC1-1639 G allele, 0.099; VKORC1-
1639 A allele, 0.901; CYP2C9*1 allele,
0.975; CYP2C9*3 allele, 0.025. No deviation
from the Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium was
observed in VKORC1-1639 G > A and
CYP2C9 genotypes. The CYP2C9*2,*4,*5
variants were not detected in any of the
participants. The majority of the study
population was homozygous for the
CYP2C9*1*1 genotype, while the remainder
were heterozygous for the CYP2C9*1*3
genotype (Table 2). Of 96 homozygous
CYP2C9*1*1 patients, 77 were homozygous
for VKORC1-1639 AA, 18 were heterozy-
gous for VKORC1-1639 AG and one was
homozygous for VKORC1-1639 GG. The
five heterozygous CYP2C9*1*3 patients
were all homozygous for VKORC1-1639
AA. For statistical comparisons between
the VKORC1 genotype groups, data from
one homozygous VKORC1-1639 GG patient
were excluded. There were no significant
differences in age, sex, height or weight
between the CYP2C9 genotype groups or
between the VKORC1 genotype groups.
Relationship between genotype and
fourth-day INR value
Patients with the homozygous VKORC1-
1639 AA genotype exhibited a mean INR of
1.87 Æ 0.14, which was significantly higher
than the INR observed in patients with the

(mean INR 1.32 Æ 0.15; P < 0.001;
Figure 1A). These results were not altered
by the exclusion of five patients with a
CYP2C9*1*3 genotype from analysis of the
fourth-day INR in the VKORC1 genotype
group. There was no significant difference in
mean INRs between the CYP2C9*1*1 and
CYP2C9*1*3 groups (INR ¼ 1.76 Æ 0.26
and 1.93 Æ 0.19, respectively). These results
were not altered by the exclusion of 18
patients with the VKORC1-1639 AG geno-
type from analysis of the CYP2C9 genotype
group (Figure 1B). No significant relation-
ship was found between the factors of sex,
age, height, weight, indications for warfarin
treatment and the fourth-day INR
(Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
test). VKORC1 genotype was found to be
the only factor that influenced the fourth-
day INR, accounting for 46.3% of INR
variability (R ¼ 0.685, R2
adj
¼ 0.463,
P < 0.001, multiple linear analysis).
Relationship between genotype and
warfarin daily maintenance dose
The median warfarin daily maintenance
dose requirement was significantly higher
in patients with the VKORC1-1639 GA
genotype compared with the VKORC1-
1639 AA genotype (4.83 Æ 0.70 mg versus
2.40 Æ 0.70 mg, respectively, P < 0.001).
This result was not significantly altered by
the removal of five patients with the
CYP2C9*1/*3 genotype from the analysis
of warfarin daily maintenance dose in the
VKORC1 genotype group (Figure 1C).
There was no significant difference in war-
farin daily maintenance dose between the
CYP2C9*1*1 and CYP2C9*1*3 groups
(median maintenance dose 3.00 mg versus
1.88 mg, respectively). This result was not
altered by the removal of 18 patients with
the VKORC1-1639 AG genotype from the
analysis of the CYP2C9 genotype group
(Figure 1D).
Multivariate analysis
Using stepwise regression analysis,
VKORC1-1639 polymorphism (P < 0.001),
weight (P < 0.001) and age (P ¼ 0.019) were
shown to have independent and significant
effects on the variability in warfarin main-
tenance dose (Table 3): Combined, these
three factors accounted for 70.1% of the
overall interindividual variability in war-
farin daily maintenance dose in Chinese
patients (R ¼ 0.844, R2
adj
¼ 0.701,
P < 0.001). CYP2C9 variants, height, sex
and indications for warfarin treatment were
not found to have significant effects on the
variability in warfarin maintenance dose.
Discussion
Warfarin, a coumarin derivative first intro-
duced in 1954, remains the predominant oral
anticoagulant available for long-term use.13
Some patients require higher-than-expected
doses of warfarin to increase their INR into
the therapeutic range. This phenomenon can
be attributed to acquired (poor compliance,
drug interactions, dietary interactions) or
hereditary factors.14­16 The present study

The main allelic polymorphisms known to
be involved in warfarin metabolism are
those associated with CYP2C9 and

frequency and degree of these polymorph-
isms influences response to warfarin in the
Chinese population.
Ethnic differences in frequencies of
VKORC1-1639G > A and CYP2C9*2, *3,
*4 and *5 alleles are already known to exist.2
Distinct from Caucasian populations, the
frequency of the VKORC1-1639 GG geno-
type is 0­2%, the GA genotype $18%, and
the AA genotype $80% in the Chinese
population.18 The frequency of the
CYP2C9*1*1 genotype is reported to be
$95%, the *1*3 genotype $5% and the
*3*3 genotype 0% (i.e., not present).The
*2,*4 and *5 variants have also been
reported as being absent in the Chinese
population.19 The VKORC1-1639 AA geno-
type is widely distributed in the Chinese
population, and the allele frequency of
VKORC1-1639 G > A in the present study
corresponded with that published else-
where.17 Allele frequencies of the CYP2C9
gene in the present study were consistent
with those previously reported.17,19
The initial phase of anticoagulation treat-
ment is the most challenging step, since the
optimal dose for any patient is uncertain and
the dosing is often given empirically, engen-
dering a high risk of over-anticoagulation or
haemorrhagic events.20,21 The major finding
of the present study was that VKORC1-1639
SNPs, rather than CYP2C9 variants, affect
the early response to warfarin. Patients with
the VKORC1-1639 AA genotype had a
significantly higher INR than those with
the VKORC1-1639 AG genotype, and cor-
respondingly, the warfarin daily mainten-
ance dose was lower in the VKORC1-1639
AA group than in the VKORC1-1639 GA
group. In the present study there was no
difference between the CYP2C9*1*1 and
*1*3 groups, however, in terms of INR or
warfarin daily dose requirements. Although
the CYP2C9*2 and *3 polymorphisms are
found in 20% of the Caucasian population,
only 6­10% of warfarin interindividual
variability can be attributed to these two
genotypes.22 In the present study, the influ-
ence of the VKORC1-1639 G > A poly-
morphism is clearly suggested by the initial
stage of warfarin response, and the sus-
tained response, in Chinese patients.
The authors understand that drug resist-
ance is a complex phenomenon involving
many environmental and genetic factors. To
assess whether demographic factors contrib-
uted to patients' response to warfarin, mul-
tiple logistic regression analysis was
performed in the present study. Using a
stepwise method, VKORC1-1639 G > A
SNP, age and weight were revealed as factors
associated with interindividual variability in
the daily warfarin dose. Although CYP2C9
genetic variants have been recognized as key
factors affecting daily warfarin dose in other
research,23 this was not the case in the

present study. This discrepancy between
results may be due to the fact that: (I) allele
frequency of the CYP2C9*3 genotype,
which affects CYP2C9 enzyme activity, is
too low to cause significant distinction in the
Chinese population, and (II) the sample size
of the present study population was not
sufficient to detect significant differences.
In August 2007, the American Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approved a
labelling change for warfarin that described
the reported effects of VKORC1 and
CYP2C9 on dose requirements, stating
that `lower initiation doses should be con-
sidered for patients with certain genetic
variations in CYP2C9 and VKORC1
enzymes'. The FDA also encouraged clinical
tests for these genetic variants before initiat-
ing warfarin therapy.24,25 The dose and
administration of warfarin must be indivi-
dualized according to the particular
patient's genetic background. The present
study suggests that specific recommenda-
tions should be made for the Chinese popu-
lation, since the VKORC1-1639 G > A SNP
might be the dominant genetic factor asso-
ciated with warfarin response variability in
Chinese patients. In order to reduce haem-
orrhagic complications while obtaining the
appropriate INR for antithrombolytic
effects in Chinese patients with the
VKORC1-1639 AA genotype, the initial
and maintenance doses of warfarin should
be lower in relation to patients with the
VKORC1-1639 AG genotype, compared
with those who have other genotypes. In
the Chinese population, the CYP2C9 geno-
type may have a much smaller role in the
metabolism of warfarin than the VKORC1
genotype. In order to further verify these
results via a large-scale prospective study, it
may only be necessary to assess the
VKORC1-1639 SNP in the Chinese popula-
tion, hence saving the cost of assessing
CYP2C9 variants.
A limitation of the present study is the
relatively small sample size. Despite this, the
authors consider the present study to be a
valid attempt to evaluate the interindividual
variability of warfarin maintenance dose in
Chinese Han patients. The present results
require further independent validation using
a larger sample size and the authors plan to
investigate a larger patient cohort in future.
In summary, the present study findings
show that the distribution of CYP2C9 and
VKORC1-1639 G > A genetic polymorph-
isms in Chinese Han patients differ from
those reported for Caucasian populations.
In the Chinese population, VKORC1-
1639 G > A polymorphisms may be the
dominant genetic factors associated with
variability in warfarin response.
