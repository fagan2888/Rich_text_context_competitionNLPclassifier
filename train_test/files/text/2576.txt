Abstract
Background
People who are perceived as good looking or as having a pleasant personality enjoy many
advantages, including higher educational attainment. This study examines (1) whether
associations between physical/personality attractiveness and educational attainment vary
by parental socioeconomic resources and (2) whether parental socioeconomic resources
predict these forms of attractiveness. Based on the theory of resource substitution with
structural amplification, we hypothesized that both types of attractiveness would have a
stronger association with educational attainment for people from disadvantaged back-
grounds (resource substitution), but also that people from disadvantaged backgrounds
would be less likely to be perceived as attractive (amplification).
Methods
This study draws on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health--including repeated interviewer ratings of respondents' attractiveness--and trait-
state structural equation models to examine the moderation (substitution) and mediation
(amplification) of physical and personality attractiveness in the link between parental socio-
economic resources and educational attainment.
Results
Both perceived personality and physical attractiveness have stronger associations with
educational attainment for people from families with lower levels of parental education (sub-
stitution). Further, parental education and income are associated with both dimensions of
perceived attractiveness, and personality attractiveness is positively associated with educa-
tional attainment (amplification). Results do not differ by sex and race/ethnicity. Further,

Conclusions
Perceived attractiveness, particularly personality attractiveness, is a more important psy-
chosocial resource for educational attainment for people from disadvantaged back-
grounds than for people from advantaged backgrounds. People from disadvantaged
backgrounds, however, are less likely to be perceived as attractive than people from
advantaged backgrounds.
Introduction
People who are perceived as good looking or as having a pleasant personality enjoy a host of
social advantages. Physical attractiveness has a well-established link with earnings and other
desirable job-related outcomes [1­9]. Indeed, one study suggests that the return on attractive-
ness is comparable in magnitude to the return on ability [2]. Studies have also identified effects
of perceived physical attractiveness on educational outcomes, including teacher's perceptions
of academic ability, grade point average (GPA), and educational attainment [10­14].
Associations between perceived personality attractiveness and attainments have received far
less attention than perceived physical attractiveness, and studies report mixed results [10,15].
Although not measuring an attractive personality per se, numerous studies have examined the
effects of different dimensions of personality on educational and labor market outcomes [16­
21]. Some dimensions of personality--especially, in the American context, agreeableness and
extraversion--likely foster perceptions of an attractive personality. Research has identified
associations of agreeableness with GPA and educational attainment [20,22] and of extraversion
with job performance and work conditions [20,23]. Of the five dimensions of personality rec-
ognized by the NEO Personality Inventory, conscientiousness is most consistently related to
indicators of attainment, GPA, earnings, and occupational prestige [22,24­27].
This paper extends this research in four respects. First, the association between attractive-
ness and attainments may vary by parental status such that attractiveness is a resource that
compensates for low SES background. That is, the association between attractiveness and
attained education may be stronger for children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. Second,
attractiveness is one potential mechanism by which attainments reproduce across the genera-
tions. This mediational hypothesis (i.e., parental status ! attractiveness ! attained education)
stems from the idea that higher status parents have the resources to foster attractiveness in
their children, which in turn evokes more positive assessments from other people (e.g., teachers
and employers). Third, past studies typically focus on measures of attractiveness at one point
in time. This study, in contrast, extracts the stable trait component of attractiveness from three
measures spanning the time period from adolescence to young adulthood and thus addresses
measurement error that arises from a reliance on measuring attractiveness at a single time
point. Finally, most past studies focus on one dimension of attractiveness--either physical or
personality--at a time despite the fact that they are likely correlated (but see [10] for an excep-
tion). This study simultaneously assesses both physical and personality attractiveness in the
same models.

Attractiveness As a Substituted Resource
Drawing on Ross and Mirowsky's work on resource substitution and structural amplification
[28­31], we hypothesize that perceived attractiveness, both physical and personality, may
have a stronger association with educational attainment at lower levels of parent socioeco-
nomic resources. The resource substitution hypothesis states that a given psychosocial
resource will be more beneficial for people who have fewer alternative psychosocial resources.
For instance, education influences health moreso among people with less (versus highly) edu-
cated parents [31].
In the present context, perceived attractiveness represents a psychosocial resource that
fosters educational attainment and may function as an alternate resource when family socio-
economic resources are lacking. Youth whose behaviors comport to middle-class expecta-
tions are known to fare better in classrooms, even with adjustments for intellectual ability
[32]. Such youth are less disruptive and they constructively contribute to the social dynamics
of the classroom, which teachers reward both explicitly and implicitly. For example, youth
who are competent, goal- driven, and easy to get along with may appear a "better investment"
of a teacher's time than youth who are impulsive and behaviorally challenging [33]. Indeed,
attractive youth from low status households may be more likely to elicit support from teach-
ers, and these relationships are positively associated with educational continuation [34]. Con-
sistent with these mechanisms, both perceived physical and personality attractiveness may,
in part, compensate for some of the disadvantages associated with a poor socioeconomic
background.
Attractiveness and Intergenerational Status
Parent socioeconomic resources may enhance perceptions of their children's attractiveness via
several mechanisms. First, economic resources could directly influence perceptions of attrac-
tiveness by enabling children to purchase fashionable clothing and other accoutrements of
wealth and status. Second, parent socioeconomic resources tend to be associated with adopting
healthier lifestyles that in turn may increase perceptions of attractiveness. Parental education
is associated with knowledge about health and diet, and higher income allows people to buy
healthier, fresh foods and to enroll their children in sports camps, gyms, and other activities. In
turn, children of higher status parents have lower body mass indices and such people tend to
be perceived as more attractive [35,36]. Third, parent socioeconomic resources are known to
be associated with various dimensions of personality that are likely to be factors in ratings of
perceived attractiveness [20,37,38]. For instance, one study found that higher levels of parental
education are associated with higher ratings of agreeableness, extraversion, and imagination
and lower ratings of neuroticism among their adult children [20].
If perceived attractiveness has a greater effect on educational attainment for people with
less socioeconomic resources (i.e., moderation) and perceived attractiveness is a mechanism
through which parent socioeconomic resources shape their children's educational attainment
(i.e., mediation), then a pattern emerges that Ross and Mirowsky refer to as "structural amplifi-
cation" [20,29,39]. In the context of this study, structural amplification refers to the possibility
that those youth most likely to benefit from perceived attractiveness will be least likely to be
perceived as attractive.
Data and Methods
Data for this analysis come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult
Health (Add Health). Wave I of Add Health is a nationally representative sample of adoles-
cents who were enrolled in middle school or high school in 1994. The sample was obtained
Attractiveness and Education
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0155313 June 1, 2016 3 / 15
by first randomly selecting 80 high schools from a list of all high schools in the United
States stratified to ensure adequate representation of different regions, types of schools, eth-
nic compositions of schools, and study body sizes. The 80 high schools were then paired with
65 middles schools that fed into their student body. The combined 145 middle and high
schools hosted an in-school survey that yielded 90,118 student respondents in grades 7
through 12 in 1994. Approximately 200 students from each school were randomly selected
for in-depth in-home interviews, which resulted in a sample of 20,745 adolescents at Wave I.
The in-home component also included an interview with a parent or caretaker (typically
the mother or female head of the household if available). The parent/caretaker interviews
included information about parent socioeconomic resources that is used in the following
analyses.
A second wave of data was collected roughly one year after the first wave and included
N = 14,738 respondents. A third wave of data was collected in 2001­02, roughly seven years
after the first wave of data. The third wave included 15,197 respondents between the ages of 18
and 28. Finally, a fourth wave of data was collected roughly 14 years after Wave I. The fourth
wave included 15,700 respondents between the ages of 24 and 34. Add Health participants pro-
vided written informed consent for participation in all aspects of Add Health in accordance
with the University of North Carolina School of Public Health Institutional Review Board
guidelines. The University of North Carolina Institutional Review Board has approved the
research reported as part of R01HD061622. Information about obtaining access to Add Health
data can be found at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth.
The analytic sample consists of respondents present in all four waves (N = 10,120). An addi-
tional seven respondents were dropped who were missing data for sex, race, or educational
attainment (N = 10,113). Multiple imputation via chained equations was used to address miss-
ing data in the remaining covariates by constructing 10 complete data sets. The number of
complete data sets, 10, was chosen to help ensure stable parameter estimates and standard
errors [40]. Most of the covariates had missing data for less than 5 percent of respondents,
but parental income was missing for a greater percentage of respondents (22 percent). Diag-
nostics were performed on the imputed values for parental income and results indicated that
the imputed values did not significantly alter the distribution of the measure.
Measures
The measures of perceived attractiveness come from two items completed by interviewers at
each wave (we use Waves 1, 2, and 3). The first item is "how physically attractive is the respon-
dent?" and the second item is "how attractive is the respondent's personality?" For both items
interviewers rated respondents from 1 "very unattractive" to 5 "very attractive." For both
dimensions of attractiveness, ratings averaged between 3 ("about average") and 4 ("attractive")
at every wave (see Table 1).
The outcome for this analysis is educational attainment measured at Wave IV. Values range
from 1 "less than high school education" to 5 "more than a four-year college degree." The
study relies on two measures of parent socioeconomic resources. The first is the highest level of
education completed by either parent, coded the same as respondent education. The second is
logged family income reported by the parent. Parent education and parent income are both
obtained from a parent questionnaire. Respondents had an average attainment between some
postsecondary education and four-year degree while parental education averaged close to some
postsecondary education (see Table 1). Both respondent education and parental education are
treated as continuous measures in the following analyses.

The models include a number of potential confounders that may be related to parent socio-
economic resources and influence both perceived attractiveness and educational attainment.
The confounders include sociodemographic measures: the age of respondents at Wave IV, sex,
race (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other race), family structure in
adolescence (two-biological parents, two parents, single mother, single father, and other family
structure), and the region of the United States in which the respondent lived in adolescence
(west, midwest, south, and northeast). Three additional potential confounders capture cogni-
tive/academic ability and body size: Peabody picture vocabulary test [41], self reported GPA at
Wave I when respondents were in high school, and adolescent BMI.
Statistical Models
The analytic approach relies on extracting the stable components ("traits") of perceived physi-
cal and personality attractiveness by specifying each dimension of attractiveness as a latent var-
iable measured by the three indicators over time. The latent variables for attractiveness are
then incorporated into a larger model of predictors of educational attainment. The larger
model allows for the specification of interactions between the latent variables for attractiveness
and the measures of parent socioeconomic resources. The model without interactions can be
represented by the following system of equations

where i indexes respondents, j indexes waves 1, 2, and 3, edu is respondent's education, L phy
and L per are latent perceived physical and personality attractiveness respectively, phy and per
are the measures of perceived physical and personality attractiveness across the three waves,
pedu and pinc are parental education and logged parental income, and x is a vector of addi-
tional covariates. Interactions between latent attractiveness measures and parent socioeco-
nomic resources can be included in the first equation.
The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first step is to develop a measurement model for
perceived physical attractiveness and attractive personality. The second step is to specify struc-
tural equation models that treat the two latent attractiveness variables as mediators in the edu-
cational attainment model. The third step is to test whether parental education and parental
income moderate any effects of attractiveness on educational attainment. Parameters estimated
based on the models in the second and third steps allow us to assess our primary research ques-
tions: (1) whether associations between physical/personality attractiveness and educational
attainment vary by parental socioeconomic resources and (2) whether parental socioeconomic
resources are associated with perceived physical and personality attractiveness.
Auxiliary analyses were conducted to analyze whether the relationships observed in the
overall sample hold for subgroups defined by sex and race, whether the observed relationships
held net of specific personality dimensions, and whether the observed relationships held in a
sibling subsample. Past studies suggest that standards of attractiveness are more salient for
women than men and that there are also racial and ethnic differences in the assessment of
attractiveness [42]. Despite these differences, however, empirical studies have generally not
found that perceived attractiveness has a greater effect for different demographic subgroups
[5,13]. Nonetheless, the first auxiliary analysis examines whether the role of perceived attrac-
tiveness in mediating and/or moderating the link between parent socioeconomic resources and
educational attainment differs by sex and race/ethnicity.
The second auxiliary analysis adds measures of the Big Five personality traits [43] to the
models to help determine whether specific dimensions of personality account for any potential
relationship between personality attractiveness and educational attainment. Wave IV of Add
Health includes the Mini-IPIP, a 20-item short-form version of the International Personality
Item Pool that is designed to measure the Big Five factors of personality [44]. These items were
used to construct scales for agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, imagination, and
neuroticism.
The third auxiliary analysis tests whether associations between perceived attractiveness and
educational attainment remain after accounting for unobserved family factors that may shape
both attractiveness and educational attainment. This analysis leverages the sibling subsample
of Add Health to specify sibling fixed effects models to address confounding by unobserved
family factors. The sibling subsample consists of 2,766 siblings from 1,383 families with non-
missing data for educational attainment. Missing data in the covariates were handled via multi-
ple imputation with chained equations by creating 10 complete data sets. The sibling fixed
effects model was specified to incorporate latent measures of perceived physical and personal-
ity attractiveness in addition to covariates that vary within sibling pairs (Peabody vocabulary
test scores, grade point average, and body mass index) [45].
The analyses involve specifying structural equation models in which latent variables (per-
ceived physical and personality attractiveness) interact with observed variables (parental edu-
cation and log parental income). The numerical procedures for estimating a model involving
latent interactions do not permit the inclusion of sample weights [46]. Because of this, the anal-
yses do not use the Add Health sample weights to adjust for unequal probabilities of inclusion
and attrition over time. Instead, the analyses rely on including the primary variables that
account for the unequal probabilities of inclusion in the sample in the models [47].

The data were prepared for analysis using Stata v13 [48] and the structural equation models
were estimated using Mplus v7 [46]. All of the Stata and Mplus code for the analysis is available

Results
Measurement Model for Perceived Attractiveness
The first step in the analysis is to develop a measurement model for the two types of perceived
attractiveness. A natural starting point is a model that specifies a latent variable for perceived
physical attractiveness and a latent variable for perceived personality attractiveness each mea-
sured by their respective indicators across the first three waves of data (Model 1). Interviewers
might have a tendency to rate respondents high or low on both physical attractiveness and
attractive personality at any given wave independent of the trait component of each measure.
To capture this possibility, a second model specification allowed the disturbances for physical
attractiveness and attractive personality to be correlated at each wave (Model 2).
Table 2 presents model fit statistics and selected parameter estimates for Models 1 and 2.
The overall model fit statistics strongly support the model allowing for correlated disturbances
over the baseline model. Although the chi-square statistic remains significant in Model 2, all of
the other measures of model fit suggest that the model is a good fit with the data--the BIC is
negative, the CFI and TLI are both close to 1, and the RMSEA is below .05. In addition, the

correlation between latent physical and personality attractiveness is estimated to be 1.31, an
impossible value, in Model 1, which is another indication of poor model fit.
In Model 2, the Wave 2 and Wave 3 indicators for perceived physical attractiveness and
attractive personality are strongly associated with their respective latent variables as indicated
by the factor loadings (the factor loadings for the Wave 1 indicators are fixed to 1 in order to
identify the model). The correlation between the two dimensions of perceived attractiveness
(r = .72) is positive and moderate-to-high in magnitude. Finally, the estimated reliabilities
reveal that the indicators of attractiveness contain a notable amount of measurement error.
The reliabilities at best come close to .4, but are below .1 for the Wave 3 indicators. These low
reliabilities underscore the importance of extracting the trait components of perceived attrac-
tiveness from the noisy measures. Thus, the analysis proceeds with the second measurement
model to introduce latent perceived attractiveness into the educational attainment model.
Perceived Attractiveness and Educational Attainment
Steps 2 and 3 of the analysis incorporate the measurement model for perceived physical and
personality attractiveness into a model for educational attainment and introduce interactions
between the latent dimensions of perceived attractiveness and parent socioeconomic resources.
Table 3 presents selected parameter estimates from the model incorporating the two dimen-
sions of perceived attractiveness and from a set of four additional models that add interactions
between the two dimensions of perceived attractiveness and the two measures of parent socio-
economic resources (the complete set of parameter estimates is available at the github reposi-
tory referenced above).

The first column of Table 3, labeled M1, reports selected estimates for the predictors of edu-
cational attainment. As expected, both parental education and logged parental income have
positive associations with educational attainment (b = .18 and b = .13 respectively). Perceived
personality attractiveness also has a positive association with educational attainment (b = .30),
but perceived physical attractiveness does not. The size of the personality effect on educational
attainment, when standardized, is comparable to the effect of parental income, about half the
effect of parental education, and about a third of the effect of GPA.
Associations between other covariates (not shown in Table 3) and educational attainment
are largely consistent with past studies. Women, people who grew up with both biological
parents (as compared with other two parent households and single mother households), people
living in the Northeast (as compared with people living in the West), and people with more
facility with English and cognitive abilities (as indicated by Peabody vocabulary test scores and
GPA) are all associated with higher levels of education. In addition, people living in the South
have slightly lower levels of education than people living in the West.
Models 2 through 5 introduce the interactions between parent socioeconomic resources and
the two dimensions of perceived attractiveness. In the model that includes an interaction term
between parental education and perceived personality attractiveness (M2), the two main
effects (parental education b = .13, personality attractiveness b = .53) and the interaction effect
(b = -.07) are all predictors of educational attainment. This pattern of positive main effects and
a negative interaction indicates that the association between perceived personality attractive-
ness and education is reduced at higher levels of parental education (see Fig 1, Panel A). This is
apparent in the steeper slope for personality attractiveness at lower levels of parental education
than at higher levels of parental education. In other words, as predicted, perceived personality
attractiveness has a stronger association with educational attainment at lower levels of parental
education.
Fig 1. Response surface plot illustrating interaction of latent perceived attractiveness and parental education on educational
attainment. Parental education ranges from 1 to 5. The latent dimensions of perceived attractiveness have mean 0 and standard deviations
.40 and .44 for personality attractiveness and physical attractiveness respectively. The graph thus captures roughly plus/minus 2 standard
deviations. The z-axis illustrates how the effect on educational attainment varies across the ranges of perceived attractiveness and parental
education based on the parameter estimates reported in Table 3, Models 2 and 3.

Model 3 includes an interaction term between parental education and perceived physical
attractiveness. In this model, a similar pattern of estimates is observed as found with perceived
personality attractiveness: the two main effects are positive (parental education b = .13, physi-
cal attractiveness b = .25) and the interaction effect is negative (b = -.06). Once again, this
particular pattern of effects suggests that the association between perceived physical attractive-
ness and educational attainment is stronger at lower levels of parental education (see Fig 1,
Panel B).
Models 4 and 5 introduce interactions between parental income and both dimensions of
perceived attractiveness. In both models the confidence intervals for the interaction terms over-
lap 0 and thus there is no evidence that the associations between perceived attractiveness and
educational attainment vary across different levels of parental income.
The last two columns of Table 3 report estimates of the associations of parent socioeco-
nomic resources with latent perceived personality and physical attractiveness respectively.
Parental education has positive associations with both perceived personality attractiveness
(b = .02) and perceived physical attractiveness (b = .02). Similarly, logged parental income also
has positive associations with both perceived personality attractiveness (b = .03) and perceived
physical attractiveness (b = .06). The sizes of the effects are not large, but, when standardized,
are comparable in magnitude to the effect of BMI on perceived personality attractiveness and
to about half of the effect of being female on perceived physical attractiveness.
Interestingly, other positive correlates of each dimension of perceived attractiveness include
women, Hispanics (as compared with whites), and people with more facility with English and
cognitive abilities (as indicated by Peabody vocabulary test scores and GPA). People with
higher BMIs in adolescence are perceived as less physically attractive and as having a less
attractive personality.
Auxiliary Analyses: Sex and Race/Ethnicity
Auxiliary analyses by sex and race/ethnicity were conducted to determine whether the patterns
observed in the full sample held among different subgroups. Parameters for the two measure-
ment models for perceived attractiveness outlined above were estimated separately for females
and males and for whites, blacks, Hispanics, and other racial/ethnic groups. For all subgroups
the second model fit the data better than the first, and the parameter estimates for the second
model (i.e., the factor loadings, correlation between the two latent dimensions of attractiveness,
and the reliabilities of the indicators) were similar to the overall measurement model. There-
fore, the second measurement model specification that allowed correlated disturbances
between the indicators of physical and personality attractiveness at each given wave was used
for all subgroups.
Separate models by sex revealed a similar pattern of results as observed in the full sample
(results available at the github repository referenced above). Parental education, parental
income, and perceived personality attractiveness have associations with educational attainment
for both females and males. The interactions between parental education and perceived per-
sonality attractiveness and between parental income and perceived personality attractiveness
exhibit the same pattern of positive main effects and negative interaction effect, but they are
only statistically significant among females. Finally, parental education and parental income
have positive associations with both dimensions of perceived attractiveness for females and
males; however, the confidence interval for the association between parental education and
perceived physical attractiveness among females includes 0.
Separate models by race/ethnicity also reveal a similar pattern of results as observed in the
full sample, though with fewer statistically significant associations (results available at the
Attractiveness and Education
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0155313 June 1, 2016 10 / 15
github repository referenced above). Parental education, parental income, and perceived per-
sonality attractiveness all have positive associations with educational attainment among every
racial/ethnic group with the one exception of parental income among Hispanics. In the models
including interactions between parent socioeconomic resources and perceived attractiveness,
the only interaction is between perceived physical attractiveness and parental education among
Hispanics. For all racial/ethnic groups, however, the pattern of positive main effects for parent
socioeconomic resources and perceived personality attractiveness and a negative interaction
remains. Furthermore, the estimates for the associations between parental socioeconomic
resources and perceived attractiveness are all similar in magnitude to the estimates in the full
sample, though some are not statistically significant.
These results indicate that the role of perceived attractiveness in the link between parent
socioeconomic resources and educational attainment operates similarly among females and
males and among whites, blacks, Hispanic, and other races. The reduced statistical power from
considering members of each group separately renders some of the associations non-signifi-
cant, but there is no evidence that perceived attractiveness plays a different role in the educa-
tional attainment process by sex or race/ethnicity.
Auxiliary Analysis: Big Five Dimensions of Personality
The second auxiliary analysis examined whether including the Big Five dimensions of person-
ality (agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, imagination, and neuroticism) in the
model attenuated the association between personality attractiveness and educational attain-
ment and/or altered the pattern of resource substitution. Adjusting for the specific dimensions
of personality attenuates the effect of personality attractiveness on educational attainment by
27 percent (b = .30 in primary analysis and b = .22 in auxiliary analysis), but an association
between personality attractiveness and educational attainment remains. In addition, the inclu-
sion of the Big Five dimensions of personality does not alter the pattern of resource substitution
described above.
Auxiliary Analysis: Sibling Fixed Effects
The third auxiliary analysis relies on sibling fixed effects models to test whether associations
between perceived attractiveness and educational attainment remain once one accounts for
family-level unobserved confounders. In fact, both latent personality attractiveness (b = .32)
and latent perceived attractiveness (b = .41) maintain positive associations with educational
attainment net of Peabody vocabulary test scores, grade point average, and body mass index at
wave 1. Thus the relationship between perceived attractiveness and educational attainment
does not appear to be substantially affected by unobserved family level confounders.
Discussion
Detailed understanding of the intergenerational reproduction of status and mobility is of criti-
cal importance given recent trends in American society that document growing inequality.
How do the children of less well-educated parents "get ahead?" Evidence shows that achieve-
ment is not solely based on relevant merits. Yet the extent to which other forms of capital
contribute to status is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine (1)
whether the association between attractiveness and educational attainment varies by parent
socioeconomic resources and (2) whether parent socioeconomic resources are associated with
attractiveness.
With respect to the first research question, the results suggest that both perceived personal-
ity and physical attractiveness have stronger associations with educational attainment for
Attractiveness and Education

people coming from families with low levels of parental education. In other words, perceived
attractiveness may compensate for other background disadvantages with respect to educational
attainment, but people from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to be perceived as
attractive. This pattern of results extends the resource substitution with structural amplification
theory developed by Ross and Mirowsky beyond health outcomes to the status attainment pro-
cess and non-cognitive traits.
The results also indicate that perceived personality attractiveness has a positive association
with educational attainment. This finding suggests that past studies that have focused exclu-
sively on physical attractiveness appear to be missing the more important dimension of person-
ality attractiveness, which reflects factors other than the Big Five personality dimensions.
Given the excellent content validity of the Big Five, the issue for future research becomes what,
beyond the Big Five, makes people's personality attractive? Plausible candidates include inter-
personal warmth, body language (e.g., eye contact), cooperativeness, and motivational charac-
teristics. Yet plausible candidates must contend with the fact that our measure of "personality
attractiveness" reflected an impression that the respondent made on the interviewer during a
short visit.
Additionally, most past studies have not addressed measurement error in the indicators of
attractiveness, and thus past findings of physical attractiveness may be biased. Given the nota-
ble magnitude of measurement error that we observe, reliance on state-based measures may be
highly misleading. It is often asserted that measurement error leads to attenuation of effects,
but this is only true in bivariate analyses. In analyses involving numerous covariates, particu-
larly covariates that may also contain non-negligible measurement error, the bias can be in any
direction [49].
With respect to the second research question, the results indicate that parent socioeconomic
resources have a small association with both dimensions of perceived attractiveness. Nonethe-
less, the magnitudes of the associations are roughly comparable with the associations between
BMI and perceived personality attractiveness and about half of the gap between females and
males in perceived physical attractiveness.
Why do these forms of attractiveness matter for attainment? Prior research suggests that
attractive students may elicit attention from teachers and coaches and unrelated adult mentors
[34]. Yet the mechanisms are not known and deserve further attention, particularly to inform
interventions to assist educators.
Limitations
One important limitation of this study is that estimates should not be interpreted as causal
effects. Although the study is able to incorporate a wide array of potential confounders, includ-
ing two measures of ability and adolescent body size, and the relationships between perceived
attractiveness and educational attainment remain once one adjusts for unobserved family-level
confounders, additional unmeasured within-family confounders could influence parent socio-
economic resources, perceived attractiveness, and educational attainment.
An additional limitation of this study is that there is only a single rating of attractiveness for
each respondent within a given wave. Ideally, the data would have included multiple interview-
ers' ratings of the physical and personality attractiveness of each respondent at each wave. Such
information would have allowed for an assessment of the within-wave reliability of the attrac-
tiveness measures. Lacking these data, analyses cannot correct for the potential systematic bias
in some interviewers' assessments of attractiveness at each wave. This limitation is one reason,
however, why we chose to focus on attractiveness across waves as the longitudinally-defined
Attractiveness and Education

trait helps to counter systematically over- or under-rated attractiveness at any given wave,
especially given that interviewers differed across waves.
Conclusions
Drawing on nationally representative data, trait-based measures of attractiveness, and an engag-
ing conceptual model, our paper suggests that, in contrast to students from higher class house-
holds, attractiveness promotes educational attainment moreso among students from lower class
backgrounds, but that these same students are less likely to be judged attractive. This moderat-
ing pattern reflects "resource substitution," and there is now mounting evidence that diverse
forms of capital--social, psychological, physical, financial--may be interchangeable.
The potential interchangeability of different forms of capital opens important avenues for
future work on the reproduction of inequality. Precisely how these forms of capital "substitute"
for one and other and translate into "value" in the classroom is not well understood and should
be the subject of further investigation. Such knowledge would not only improve our under-
standing of the contours of social stratification but could also have practical implications in
helping teachers foster learning in students from diverse backgrounds and with diverse constel-
lations of capital.
