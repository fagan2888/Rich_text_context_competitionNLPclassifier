Adolescent problem behaviors such as substance use, antiso-
cial behavior, and early sexual behavior, are both a social and
health concern (Duncan, Duncan, & Strycker, 2000).
Scientists have made systematic efforts to identify and help
adolescents involved in problem behavior; however, most of
these efforts have been concentrated in high-income settings
in the global north (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2007) such as
the United States, China, Turkey, Canada, Italy, the
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and Taiwan
(Arslan, Verhulst, Van der, & Rol, 1997; Greenberg, Chen,
Beam, Whang, & Dong, 2000; Jessor et al., 2003; Vazsonyi
et al., 2010).
Jessor's Problem Behavior Theory (PBT) is one of the
most important theories for explaining variation in adoles-
cents' involvement in problem behaviors (Donovan, Jessor,
& Costa, 1991). The theory has been supported by empirical
research conducted in the United States and other countries
(Jessor, 2008). Jessor (2008) has emphasized that the full
PBT explanatory model should have general applicability to
youth growing up anywhere. Although the magnitude of
problem behaviors might vary across societies, the theoreti-
cal associations between risk and protective factors and
problem behavior should be consistent across settings. Little
is known about the applicability of Jessor's PBT to Arabic
cultures that may be different not only in terms of the preva-
lence of problem behaviors and levels of risk and protection
but also in terms of cultural characteristics such as religion,
educational structure, and/or political system.
The current study examines the applicability of the PBT
in Egypt, an Arabic country. Egypt is markedly different
from other countries in which the PBT has been tested in
terms of religious, educational, political, economic, and
social indicators. Despite the societal differences and more
micro-level differences in the levels of risk factors, protec-
tive factors, and problem behavior involvement in Egypt in
comparison with other contexts, we expect to find similar
associations between risk and protective factors and problem
behaviors in the present study as observed in previous work
in other settings (e.g., Greenberg et al., 2000; Jessor et al.,
2003; Vazsonyi et al., 2010; Vazsonyi et al., 2008).
PBT
The PBT is a social­psychological framework that explains
the relationship between psychosocial protective and risk
factors and involvement in a variety of problem behaviors
such as delinquent behavior, substance use, problem drink-
ing, and early sexual intercourse (Donovan et al., 1991).
According to the theory, protective factors decrease the

Applying Problem Behavior Theory in a
Developing Arabic Country: Egypt
Omnia E. El-Shenawy1 and Abdel-Moneim Shehata1
Abstract
The current study tested the applicability of Jessor's Problem Behavior Theory in explaining problem behavior among
adolescents in Egypt. Data were collected from 887 adolescents (52% males) with a mean age of 13.4 years. Participants
rated three measures of problem behaviors (delinquent behavior, cigarette smoking, and problem substance use), three
types of psychosocial protection (models protection, controls protection, and support protection), and three types of
psychosocial risk (models risk, opportunity risk, and vulnerability risk). Female adolescents reported lower levels of problem
behavior involvement than male adolescents. Psychosocial protective and risk factors accounted for significant variation in
adolescents' problem behavior involvement. For males, models risk was the most important risk factor in problem behavior
involvement variation, whereas for females, opportunity risk was the most important risk factor. Present findings are useful
in understanding problem behavior involvement among Egyptian youth and informing the design of interventions to reduce
problem behavior.

likelihood of adolescents' involvement in problem behavior.
Psychosocial protective factors include models for positive,
prosocial behavior, personal and social controls to guard
against norm-violating behavior and an environment of sup-
port. In contrast, risk factors increase the likelihood of ado-
lescents' involvement in problem behavior. Conceptually,
psychosocial risk factors include models for risk behavior,
opportunity for engaging in risk behavior, and personal and
social vulnerability to engage in risk behavior (Costa, Jessor,
& Turbin, 2007). Psychosocial risk and protective factors
have been shown to account for substantial amounts of vari-
ance in adolescent problem behavior for both males and
females and for younger and older adolescents across groups
varying in socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity sub-
groups (Jessor et al., 2003). In addition, the theory hypothe-
sizes that protective factors play an additional indirect role in
the occurrence of adolescent problem behavior by moderat-
ing the impact of risk factors (Jessor et al., 2003) and empiri-
cal evidence has supported that moderation (Jessor et al.,
2003; Jessor, Van Den Bos, Vanderryn, Costa, & Turbin,
1995; Ndugwa et al., 2011).
Few studies have tested the applicability of PBT in devel-
oping societies. Jessor et al. (2003) examined PBT in two
adolescent samples from China and the United States.
Results indicated that the same protective and risk factors
accounted for a substantial amount of variance of problem
behaviors in both samples, even though problem behaviors
were less prevalent among Chinese adolescents than U.S.
adolescents. In another report based on the same data, Costa
et al. (2005) showed that four contexts of adolescents' life
(family, peer, school, and neighborhood) provided a substan-
tial account of problem behaviors among Chinese and
American adolescents. Results also indicated that the family
and peer contexts were the most influential in the U.S. sam-
ple, whereas the peer and school contexts were the most
influential in the Chinese sample. The neighborhood context
was least influential for both samples.
Vazsonyi et al. (2008) examined the applicability of PBT
in Georgia and Switzerland. Results supported the applica-
bility of PBT across these societies outside the United States.
A more recent study conducted by Ndugwa et al. (2011)
investigated the applicability of PBT among adolescents liv-
ing in two informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya, a low-
income country. Results indicated that protective and risk
factors provided a substantial account of adolescent's prob-
lem behavior variation. Results also indicated that models
protection can moderate the impact of risk factors on prob-
lem behavior vulnerability. Another recent comparative
study by Vazsonyi et al. (2010) investigated the extent to
which the PBT explained problem behavior in a sample of
10,310 adolescents from eight countries: Hungary, the
Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey,
and the United States. Results provided evidence of great
similarities in the associations between risk and protective
factors and the problem behavior involvement across
cultures.
Gender Differences in Problem
Behavior
Existing studies on gender differences in problem behaviors
have focused on individual problem behaviors such as sub-
stance use, academic failure, and violence (Chun & Mobley,
2010). In general, compared with females, male adolescents
have higher rates of individual problem behaviors (e.g.,
Chun & Mobley, 2010; Soo Kim & Sil kim, 2005; Williams,
Ayer, & Hawkins, 2007; Yin Drew & Watkins, 1996), are
more likely to initiate delinquent acts over time (e.g.,
Williams et al., 2007), and are more delinquent at all ages
(Miller, Malone, & Dodge, 2010). Mears, Ploeger, and Warr
(1998), however, in their study of gender differences in
delinquent behavior among adolescents in the United States
showed that males were substantially more likely than
females to have delinquent friends and appeared to be more
strongly affected by delinquent peers than were females.
However, other researchers have shown that the same risk
factors (e.g., mental health problems, running away, gang
involvement, and secure detention) predict serious, violent,
and chronic offenses among males and females (e.g.,
Johansson & Kempf-Leonard, 2009), and gender-coded
activities increased the risk of problem and delinquent
behaviors for both boys and girls (e.g., Dennis, 2012).
Few studies have examined whether gender might be a
predictive factor of multiple problem behavior involvement.
Beam, Gill-Rivas, Greenberg, and Chen (2002) found that
being male and having peers who engage in misconduct were
associated with more adolescent involvement in problem
behavior among high school students in Los Angeles. Chun
and Mobley (2010) investigated the structure of problem
behavior across gender and grade level. Results indicated
that females had a lower tendency for unconventionality
compared with males. Being female was less predictive of
problem behavior involvement among U.S. adolescents.
Overall, study findings provide a good rationale for testing
gender differences in the effects of protective and risk factors
in the present study. In addition, documenting the differences
between male and female adolescents on problem behavior
involvement in relation to protective and risk factors is
essential to better understand this phenomenon and to inform
more targeted prevention programs.
Study Context
Egypt is an Arab country located in northeast Africa with a
population of 83 million. The country covers an area of about
1 million square kilometers. More than 90% of the popula-
tion is Muslim. Official reports indicate that 18.4% of
Egyptians live below the poverty threshold and only 51.5%
El-Shenawy and Shehata 3
of Egyptian families have enough income to support their
monthly needs (Egyptian Cabinet, Information Center and
Decision Making Support, 2010). Almost a third of the popu-
lation comprises children and adolescents younger than 15
years of age (The Egyptian Central Agency for Public
Statistics, 2011).
Islamic values and norms have a huge impact on Egyptian
adolescents'behaviors. For example, there are limited oppor-
tunities to establish relations with the opposite sex (Al-Omari,
2008) as the segregation of sexes is still a very common phe-
nomenon throughout most Arab countries including Egypt.
This segregation is based on Islamic values and also rein-
forced by Arab values pertaining to the honor of the family
(Al-Omari, 2008). In addition, opportunities for residential
separation from parents and the larger family are almost non-
existent (Nydell, 2006).
Hofstede (2001) noted that Arab countries are character-
ized by collective cultures, which are thought to be less con-
ducive to the overt expression of deviance and tend to
encourage suppression of socially disapproved behavior
(Greenberg et al., 2000). However, the Egyptian societal
structure has changed during recent decades because of cul-
tural, social, and economic changes (Saif & Choucair, 2010).
Egyptian youth are exposed to liberal behavioral models
through the Internet and media that are associated with
poorer parental relationships, lower levels of religiosity, and
lower levels of academic commitment (Shehata &
El-Shenawy, 2010). Egyptian adolescents, therefore, face a
conflict between conservative social norms (e.g., obedience,
submissiveness, compliance, etc.) and liberal or unconven-
tional practices (Nydell, 2006). In fact, one aspect of
Egyptian culture urges youth to focus on Islamic knowledge
and traditional identity, while the other aspect provides them
with a new identity emphasizing use of information technol-
ogies, 21st-century science, and new global ideas (Asik,
2012).
Previous studies indicate that the problem behavior
involvement rate is higher when the children were exposed
to socioeconomic risk factors, such as poverty (Deater-
Deckard, Dodge, Bates, & Pettited, 1998; Samrakkody,
Fernando, McClure, Perera & De Silva, 2012). Official data
show an increasing rate of crimes committed by adolescents
in resource-limited settings (Egyptian Interior Ministry,
2007). Available data from a few studies carried out to
explore problem behavior in Egypt report wide variation of
prevalenceamongEgyptianstudents(Shehata&El-Shenawy,
2010; Souief, 1994). Exposure to violence in Egyptian soci-
ety has also been linked to problem behavior involvement
(Shehata, 2009).
Current Study
Few studies have examined the theoretical underpinnings of
problem behaviors among Egyptian adolescents. Problem
behavior prevalence among these adolescents can be better
understood by applying existing theoretical frameworks. The
present research examined the applicability of PBT and
explores the contribution that psychosocial protection and
risk factors can make to explain problem behavior among
male and female adolescents in Alexandria and Shebeen
El-Koom, Egypt. The study assessed (a) whether Egyptian
adolescents' scores on measures of problem behavior
involvement and on measures of protective and risk factors
differed by gender, (b) whether associations among protec-
tive and risk factors and problem behavior involvement were
similar to those found in previous studies, and (c) whether
the protective factors moderated the relationship between
risk factors and problem behavior involvement. Based on
previous studies, we expected that Egyptian female adoles-
cents would be less likely than males to report problem
behavior involvement and that the scores on measures of
protective and risk factors would differ between Egyptian
female and male adolescents. Based on Jessor's PBT, we
expected that protective factors would decrease the likeli-
hood of involvement in problem behavior, whereas risk fac-
tors would increase the likelihood of problem behavior
involvement. We also expected to find that protective factors
would also moderate the relationship between risk factors
and problem behavior involvement.
Method
Participants
Data were collected from a sample of 887 Egyptian adoles-
cents (52% males) attending intermediate schools in
Alexandria and Shebeen El-Koom. In all, 530 participants
were from Alexandria city and 357 were from Shebeen
El-Koom. Adolescents in Grade 7 were around 60%, 29%
were in Grade 8 and 11% were in Grade 9. The mean age of
the adolescents was 13.4 years. A majority of adolescents
(85%) were enrolled in public schools.
Sampling
Four schools were randomly selected from a list of the 437
Alexandria intermediate schools and three schools were ran-
domly selected from a list of the 410 Shebeen El-Koom
intermediate schools. Within each school, all students from a
non-randomly selected grade level were included in the sam-
ple after obtaining the approval of the students to participate
in the study.
Procedures
Permission to conduct the study was granted by the Egyptian
Ministry of Education. Data were collected in March 2009,
using a structured interview capturing sociodemographic
characteristics, behavior as well as measures of psychosocial
protective and risk factors. The questionnaire was translated
by the authors into Arabic language. Back translation into
English was done by an Egyptian professor in the English
4 SAGE Open
department at Menoufia University, Egypt. The Arabic trans-
lation and the back-translation were externally reviewed and
the Arabic translation was revised accordingly.
Measures
Age was measured using a single item. Participants indicated
their sex. Responses were coded 1 for male and 2 for female.
Participants were asked to indicate their educational stage.
Responses were coded 1 for Grade 7, 2 for Grade 8, and 3 for
Grade 9. The area of residence was coded as 1 for urban
(Alexandria) and 2 for rural (Shebeen El-Koom).
Problem behavior involvement was assessed using the
Multiple Problem Behavior Index (MPBI), which is an aver-
age of T-scored measures of adolescents' involvement in
three different types of problem behavior: (a) delinquent
behavior, including theft, vandalism, and physical aggres-
sion (Cronbach's  = .72 for the present study); (b) cigarette
smoking based on participants' reports of frequency and
amount of smoking in the past month and the past year
(Cronbach's  = .80 for the present study); and (c) problem
drinking (Jessor et al., 2003). The last subscale was replaced
by problem substance use; this was done because the lowest
consumption levels can be found in the countries of North
Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean
region, and southern Asia and the Indian Ocean. These
regions represent large populations of the Islamic faith,
which have very high rates of abstention (World Health
Organization, 2011, pp. 4, 274). The problem substance use
subscale is based on the adolescents' self-reports of sub-
stance use frequency, frequency of high volume substance
use, and the negative consequences of substance use
(Cronbach's  = .75 for the present study). The term sub-
stance use in the present study explicitly covers cannabis
(marijuana) and recreational use of prescription pills.
Respondents rated frequency of substance use on an 8-point
scale. Higher scores reflect high frequency of substance use.
Negative consequences of substance use were assessed by
answering five items (Table 1). The alpha reliability of the
three components of the MPBI was .70. In general, alpha
reliabilities of problem behavior measures in the present
study were comparable with other studies (Jessor et al.,
2003).
Three types of psychosocial protection (models protec-
tion, control protection, and support protection), and three
types of risk (models risk, opportunity risk, and vulnerability
risk) were assessed using Jessor and colleagues'(2003) com-
posite measures of the three types of protection and the three
types of risk. Each psychosocial composite measure was
constructed by averaging all of the items in its component
subscales, standardized and equally weighted, with a mean
of zero. A description of the measures is presented in Table 1
(for more details about the measures, see Jessor et al., 2003).
The alpha reliabilities of the three measures of protective
factors in the present study were .61 for models protection,
.71 for controls protection, and .75 for support protect. The
alpha reliabilities of the three types of risk were .70 for mod-
els risk, .78 for opportunity risk (availability), .88 for oppor-
tunity risk (gangs), and .82 for vulnerability risk. Each
measure was transformed to a T score, and means for the
study constructs were then calculated for males and females.
Statistical Analysis
As a first step, initial descriptive statistics were computed for
risk factor composite measures' scores, protective factor
composite measures' scores, and the MPBI scores. Before
examining whether the multivariate explanatory model of
PBT applies to Egyptian adolescents, we estimated the par-
tial correlations between risk and protective factors and the
problem behavior involvement index to establish the rela-
tionships of the predictor measures with the problem behav-
ior outcome variable, the MPBI. Hierarchical linear
regression analysis (enter method) was then used to assess
the applicability of PBT across Egyptian adolescent
samples.
Results
Table 2 presents group means on protective factors, risk fac-
tors, and problem behavior measures for males and females
separately. Male adolescents reported lower levels of control
protection (49.50 vs. 51.52) and vulnerability risk (49.45 vs.
50.89) than females. However, males reported a higher level
of models risk in comparison with females (49.62 vs. 45.86).
Higher levels of vulnerability risk among female adolescents
suggest that they had lower self-esteem, lower expectations
of success, greater depression, and greater stress. With
respect to problem behavior involvement, females reported
less involvement in problem behavior types than males.
Table 3 presents the bivariate correlations between prob-
lem behavior measures and protective and risk factors by
gender. Correlations among the three types of psychosocial
protection (models, controls, and support) ranged from .10 to
.57 for the male sample, and from .13 to .53 for the female
sample, which were all were positive. Correlations among
the four measures of risk factors ranged from .19 to .30 for
the male sample, from .14 to .24 for the female sample that
was again positive. As expected, correlations between the
psychosocial protective factors measures and the risk factors
measures were negative and ranged from -.04 to -.43 for the
male sample and from -0.05 to -0.46 for the female sample;
all but two were positive but not significant in both samples.
As shown in Table 3, correlations between the MPBI and the
psychosocial protective factors measures (models, controls,
and support) were -.02, -.37 (p < .01), and -.35, respec-
tively, for the male sample, whereas for the female sample
the correlations were -.22, -.37, -.36 (all ps < .01), respec-
tively. The correlations between the MPBI and the psychoso-
cial risk factors measures (model risk, opportunity risk
El-Shenawy and Shehata 5
(availability), opportunity risk (gangs), and vulnerability
risk) were 0.36, 0.31, 0.23, and 0.34 (all ps < .01), respec-
tively, for the male sample, while for the female sample the
correlations were .35 (p < .01), .24 (p < .05), .11, and .36 (p
< .01), respectively. These correlational findings provide ini-
tial support for PBT.

To examine the relative importance of the separate risk
and protective factors in explaining variation in problem
behavior involvement, hierarchical multiple regression
(enter method) models were conducted after centering all the
predictive variables (Table 4). Demographic variables (gen-
der, educational stage, and socioeconomic level) were
entered in Step 1 of the hierarchical regression accounting
for 3% (p < .001) of the variance in problem behavior
involvement. The protective factors were entered at Step 2.
This model accounted for 19% of variance (p < .001) in
problem behavior involvement. The four psychosocial risk
factors were added in the third step. This model accounted
uniquely for 29% of variance (p < .001). Given that some
variance is shared between protective and risk factors, psy-
chosocial protective factors were entered after the psychoso-
cial risk factors in a supplementary analysis and they
accounted uniquely for 3% of variance (p < .001) compared
with 11% for the risk factors.
Control protection and support protection were signifi-
cant predictors of problem behavior involvement (p < .001).
In addition, three measures of psychosocial risk factors were
significant predictors of problem behavior involvement
(model risk, opportunity risk (availability), and vulnerability
risk; p < .001).
The next set of analyses examined the possible moderat-
ing role of protective factors on the relation of risk factors to
problem behavior. Here again, demographic variables (gen-
der, educational stage, and socioeconomic level) were
entered first, followed by protective factors in the second
step, the psychosocial risk factors measures in the third step,
and the 12 interactions of the three protective and four risk
factors in the last step. Non-significant interactions at the 5%
level were later dropped, and this model was refitted with
only the significant interactions. The final model is shown in
Table 4. When the only significant interactions were added at
the last step, 31% of variance in problem behavior involve-
ment was explained. There were only three significant
interactions; however, one of those three interactions was in
the opposite direction from theoretical prediction. Figure 1
illustrates the moderator effects for protection factors on the
association between risk factors and the MPBI. Models pro-
tection significantly moderated the relationship of opportu-
nity risk­gang to the problem behavior involvement. The
relation of opportunity risk­gang to the problem behavior
involvement is stronger when models protection is low com-
pared with when models protection is high. This is illustrated
by the smaller difference between the high- and low-risk
groups under high models protection than under low models
protection (Figure 1, Graph A). In addition, control protec-
tion significantly moderated the relation of model risk to the
problem behavior involvement. High models risk was more
likely to be related to problem behavior involvement under
low control protection than high control protection (Figure 1,
Graph B).
The next set of analyses examined whether the relative
importance of separate risk and protective factors to varia-
tion in adolescents problem behavior differed by gender
(Table 5). Hierarchical regression was conducted again for
each sample. Here again, demographic variables (educa-
tional stage and socioeconomic level) were entered first, fol-
lowed by protective factors in the second step, and risk
factors in the last step. The entry of demographic variables
explained 3.7% of the variance in problem behavior involve-
ment for females and 1% for males. With the entry of the
three measures of protective factors in the next step, 22.4%
of the variance in problem behavior involvement for females
and 16% for males was explained. When the four measures
of risk factors were entered in the final step, 30.4% of vari-
ance in problem behavior involvement among females and
27.7% among males was explained. In this regression model,
the three psychosocial protective factors model protection,
control protection, and support protection were significant
predictors of problem behavior involvement (p < .05) among
females. Control protection and support protection were

significant predictors of problem behavior involvement (p <
.001) among males. In addition, three measures of psycho-
logical risk factors were significant predictors of problem
behavior involvement for both females and males (model
risk, opportunity risk (availability), and vulnerability risk; p
< .001). When psychosocial protective factors were entered
after the psychosocial risk factors in a supplementary analy-
sis, 31.4% of variance (p < .001) among the male sample and
26.7% of variance (p < .001) among the female sample was
explained.
Again, hierarchical regression was conducted for each
sample to investigate the possible moderating role of protec-
tive factors on the relation of risk factors to problem behav-
ior. Demographic variables (educational stage and
socioeconomic level) were entered first, followed by protec-
tive factors in the second step, risk factors in the third step,
and the 12 interactions of the protective and risk factors in
the last step. Non-significant interactions at the 5% level
were later dropped, and this model was refitted with only the
significant interactions. The final model is shown in Table 5
(Step 4). Only one interaction was significant in the female
sample--models protection significantly moderated the rela-
tion of model risk to problem behavior involvement. High
models risk was more likely to be related to problem behav-
ior involvement under low control protection than high con-
trol protection (Figure 1, Graph C). Two interactions were
significant in the male sample; however, one of these two
was in the opposite direction from theoretical prediction.
Control protection significantly moderated the relation of
opportunity risk­availability to the problem behavior
involvement. High opportunity risk (availability) was more
likely to be related to problem behavior involvement under
low control protection than high control protection (Figure 1,
Graph D).
Discussion
The present study examined the applicability of PBT for
Egyptian adolescents. The results indicated that female ado-
lescents have a lower tendency for unconventionality. These
results are consistent with previous gender difference stud-
ies, which indicated that being male was associated with
greater involvement in problem behavior (Beam et al., 2002)
and being female was less predictive of problem behavior
involvement (Chun & Mobley, 2010).
In general, the present results support the theoretical con-
cepts of PBT and the idea of general applicability of the PBT
explanatory model (Jessor, 2008) in an Arabic Muslim cul-
ture. Consistent with previous studies that have been con-
ducted in different cultures such as China, United States
(Jessor et al., 2003), Kenya (Ndugwa et al., 2011), Hungary,
the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Taiwan, and
Turkey (Vazsonyi et al., 2010), control protection, models
risk, opportunity risk (availability), and vulnerability risk
were found to be associated with problem behavior involve-
ment in the hypothesized directions for adolescent male and
female samples. The relationship among models protection,
support protection, and problem behavior involvement was
not significant for the adolescent male sample. Similar
results were found by Vazsonyi et al. (2010) for Hungarian,
Spanish, and Turkish samples.
Psychosocial protective and risk factors accounted for
significant variation in adolescents' problem behavior
involvement. These findings were consistent, for the most

part, for both females and males. For the male sample, mod-
els risk was the most important risk factor in explaining
problem behavior involvement variation. For females, con-
trol protection was the most important protective factor, and
opportunity risk (availability) the most important risk factor
in explaining problem behavior involvement variation. These
results indicate that although female adolescents had a lower
average level of problem behavior involvement than male
adolescents, their risk factors differ from those of males.
This may also be an indicator that the etiology of problem
behavior involvement is different for boys and girls. The
importance of separate risk and protective factors in
explaining problem behavior involvement for males and
females in the present study suggests that prevention pro-
grams need to be tailored differently for boys and girls.
In terms of the direct effects of risk and protective factors
on problem behavior involvement, both factors had nearly
equivalent associations with Egyptian female adolescents'
problem behavior involvement, but the association with risk
factors was greater than that of protective factors on Egyptian
male adolescents' problem behavior involvement. A similar
finding was observed among poor urban adolescents aged
between 12 and 14 years in Kenya (Ndugwa et al., 2011).
These results suggest the need for systematic efforts for both

protective factors promotion and risk reduction among
Egyptian adolescents.
The finding of a few significant interactions is worth
highlighting. For example, among females, models protec-
tion was shown to moderate the relation of models risk to the
problem behavior involvement, indicating that at high levels
of model risk, adolescent females with strong levels of mod-
els protection such as parents or friends models for conven-
tional and healthy behavior, show less involvement in
problem behavior than their peers with low models protec-
tion. Among males, control protection significantly moder-
ated the relation of opportunity risk (availability) to problem
behavior involvement. This indicated that at high levels of
opportunity risk (availability), males with high levels of con-
trol protection show less involvement in problem behavior
than their peers with low levels of control protection. These
findings highlight the importance of socialization, and have
important impacts on preparing intervention programs to
reduce problem behavior involvement among Egyptian
youth in contexts of high risk.
The present study has several strengths. First, it provides
an extension to previous studies that have explored the appli-
cability of Jessor's PBT across different settings in low and
middle income countries and is unique in testing the PBT in
a lower middle income Arabic country. Second, it has impor-
tant implications for understanding gender differences in
problem behavior involvement among Egyptian adolescents.
Third, the use of the psychosocial protective factors, psycho-
social risk factors, and behavior measures based on PBT and
developed by Jessor et al. (2003) as well as the large sample
size adds to the reliability of the results.
Despite these strengths, the findings of the present
research are limited in several ways. First, although the sam-
ple was obtained from different schools in urban (Alexandria)
and rural (Shebeen El-Koom) settings, the extent to which
similar findings would be observed in other Egyptian sam-
ples is unknown. Second, a need exists for longitudinal stud-
ies to examine how protective and risk factors contribute to
different problem behaviors involvement. Third, the extent
of problem behavior may be underestimated by the reliance
on self-reports. In contrast to official reports, self-reports can
provide information about undetected problem behaviors;
however, there are difficulties related to memory, honesty,
and willingness to report (Feldman, Rosenthal, Mont-
Reynaud, Leung, & Lau, 1991).
Although Egypt has a different culture and is a lower mid-
dle income country, the present findings are consistent with
different cross-national studies in several ways: (a) female
adolescents were less likely to engage in all three problem
behaviors in comparison with male adolescents and (b) the
present work indicated the usefulness of Jessor's PBT
beyond the United States, especially in low and middle
income countries. This indicates that adolescents from dif-
ferent cultures are subject to similar individual and social
factors that influence adolescents'problem behavior involve-
ment independent of where they are living.
