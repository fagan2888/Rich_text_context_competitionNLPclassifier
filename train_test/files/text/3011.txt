Background: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a
common disease with high health care costs and high
mortality rates. Knowledge of the health-related qual-
ity of life outcomes of CHF may guide decision mak-
ing and be useful in assessing new therapies for this
population.
Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted in-
volving 1390 adult patients hospitalized with an acute
exacerbation of severe CHF (New York Heart Associa-
tion class III-IV). Demographic data and health-related
quality of life were determined by interview; physi-
ologic status and cost and intensity of care were deter-
mined from hospital charts.
Results: The median (25th, 75th percentiles) age of pa-
tients was 68.0 (58.2, 76.9) years; 61.7% were male. Sur-
vival was 93.4% at discharge from the index hospitaliza-
tion, 72.9% at 180 days, and 61.5% at 1 year. Of patients
interviewed at 180 days, the median health rating on a
scale of 0 to 100 (0 indicates death; 100, excellent health)
was 60 (interquartile range, 50-80), and 59.7% were in-
dependent in their activities of daily living. Overall qual-
ity of life was reported to be good, very good, or excel-
lent in 58.2% at 180 days. Patients with worse functional
capacity were more likely to die. Health perceptions
among the patients with available interview data im-
proved at 60 and 180 days after acute exacerbation of se-
vere CHF.
Conclusions: Patients hospitalized for acute exacer-
bation of severe CHF have a generally poor 6-month
survival, but survivors retain relatively good func-
tional status and have good health perceptions. Fur-
thermore, health perceptions improve after the acute
exacerbation.

CONGESTIVE HEART failure
(CHF) is a common dis-
ease in the United
States, with a prevalence
of 7.4 per 1000 men and
4.7 per 1000 women (age-adjusted to
the US 1991 population).1 In aggregate,
there are an estimated 1 to 2 million
adults with CHF at any time in this
country,2 and the prevalence is on the
rise.3 Hospitalization rates for CHF also
have been increasing.3 Despite the high
cost of health care for patients with
CHF, survival rates are poor. Knowl-
edge of the health-related quality of life
(HRQL) outcomes of severe CHF may
guide decision making and be useful in
assessment of new therapies for this
population.
Most previous studies reporting out-
comes of CHF were performed in stable
patients1,4-19 or involved small sample
sizes.20-27 Two larger studies28,29 investi-
gated outcomes of patients hospitalized
with CHF, but did not report HRQL out-
comes. Recently, there has been an in-
crease in interest in HRQL among pa-
tients with CHF.30-33 Two large clinical
trials used HRQL measurements as an end
point to assess therapy for CHF.15,19 How-
ever, there have been no large prospec-
tive studies describing HRQL, change of
HRQL in time, or survival among adults
hospitalized due to severe CHF.
Our purposes were to describe pa-
tients whose primary reason for hospital-
ization was acute exacerbation of severe
CHF and to determine the outcomes of
these patients in terms of mortality, HRQL,
and use of resources.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The Study to Understand Prognosis and Preferences for Out-
comes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) was a prospec-
tive 5-center study of the prognoses, preferences, and deci-
sionmakingofseriouslyillhospitalizedadults,theirsurrogate
decision makers, and their physicians. Phase I of the study
describedtheprocessofdecisionmakinganddevelopedmod-
els to predict outcomes. Phase II was an interventional trial
to evaluate the effect of prognostic information and en-
hanced communication. The study population, character-
istics of patients and collaborating hospitals, data collec-
tion strategies, and statistical methods have been published
previously.34-47
STUDY POPULATION
From June 12, 1989, to June 11, 1991, and January 7, 1992,
to January 24, 1994, all admissions to general medicine,
oncology, and surgery floors and all transfers or admis-
sions to intensive care units at the participating hospitals
were screened by nurse abstractors. The study involved the
following 5 teaching hospitals: Beth Israel Hospital, Bos-
ton, Mass; Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC;
MetroHealth Medical Center, Cleveland, Ohio; St Jo-
seph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wis; and University of Cali-
fornia Medical Center, Los Angeles. Inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria for the study population have been published
previously40 and are available from one of us (N.V.D.).
Of the 9105 patients enrolled in SUPPORT, 1404 pa-
tients were admitted with acute exacerbation of severe
chronic CHF. Of those, 14 patients had incomplete docu-
mentation ofinclusioncriteriadataandwereexcluded,yield-
ing 1390 patients for this analysis.
Median(25th,75thpercentiles)follow-upwas493(153,
973) days. At 60 days after study entry, interview data were
not available for 237 patients (17.0%) who died before inter-
view, 196 (14.1%) who were unable to communicate, 159
(11.4%) who refused to participate, and 89 (6.4%) for other
reasons.At180daysafterstudyadmission,406patients(29.2%)
had not been interviewed because of death; 150 (10.8%), in-
ability to communicate; 111 (8.0%), refusal; and 77 (5.5%),
otherreasons.Vitalstatusat1yearwasavailableforallpatients.
MEASUREMENTS
Patients' physiologic status was evaluated using the Acute
Physiology Score component of the Acute Physiology and
Chronic Health Evaluation III, which is an ordinal scale
consisting of weights assigned to 17 physiologic measure-
ments.41,48,49 The Acute Physiology Score has a possible range
of scores from 0 to 252; increased scores are strongly as-
sociated with an increased risk for death. The Glasgow Coma
Scale50 was used to assess patients' neurologic status.
Patients' activity status was measured using the modi-
fied Duke Activity Status Index (DASI).42,51,52 This measure
of functional capacity gauges the patient's ability to per-
form common activities and uses the responses in a weighted
score. The possible range is from 11 (unable to walk in-
doors) to 33 (able to do vigorous exercise or aerobics).51,52
The Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) is a measure of per-
ceived health status, with a score ranging from 0 to 100. A
higher score describes worse health. The SIP has been found
to be valid and reliable53 and was used to provide a more de-
tailed measure of health status at the 60-day interview.43
Patients'functionalstatus,ie,theirlevelofperformance
of basic activities of daily living (ADL), was measured using
the modified Katz Index of Activities of Daily Living (Index
of ADL).44,54,55 The Index of ADL is a scale from 0 to 7 whose
gradesreflectdependenceinthefollowing7primaryself-care
functions:bathing,dressing,toileting,transferring,continence,
feeding, and walking (1 point for each dependency).54,55
Health perception was assessed using several instru-
ments.29,45,56,57 First, patients rated their overall quality of life
as excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. They also rated
their current state of health on a scale from 0 (death) to 100
(excellent health).45 Ratings worse than 0 were allowed but
did not occur in our sample. Utility was measured by the
time-tradeofftechnique,whichascertainstheamountoftime
in excellent health one would equate with living 1 year in the
patient's current state of health.45 General health status scales
and health utility may measure different attributes of health58
and have been found to be reliable14,57,59 and valid.45,57
Hospital resource use was assessed using the modi-
fied Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS).43,60,61
Higher TISS scores indicate higher intensity of hospital re-
source consumption. The total cost of care in 1993 dollars
was estimated by converting total charge to total cost using
each hospital's cost-charge ratio. For patients whose charge
data were missing (0.9%), total costs were estimated using
the product of average TISS score and length of stay ad-
justed for each study hospital (R2=0.84).43,62
DATA COLLECTION
Clinicaldata,includingdisease-specificinformation,werecol-
lectedfromhospitalcharts.41,46,47 Dataaboutsociodemograph-
ics, HRQL, and cognitive status were collected by interview.
Vital status was determined from follow-up interviews (with
patientorsurrogate).HospitalchartorNationalDeathIndex
mortality data were collected if interview follow-up was not
possible.Accordingtoprotocol,interviewswithpatientsand/
or their surrogates (defined as the person who would make
decisionsifthepatientwereunabletodoso)wereperformed
when possible from days 2 to 6 after study admission and at
2and6monthsafterstudyadmission.Earlyduringhospital-
ization,physicianswereaskedtoestimatetheirpatients'prob-
abilityofsurviving2and6months.Becauseinterviewdatawere
notavailableforeverypatient,andbecauseanalysisperformed

substitutionstrategy.34,63 Briefly,prioritywasgiventopatient
response.Whenpatientresponsewasmissing,acalibratedsur-
rogate response (mean patient response for each level of sur-
rogateresponse)wasused.Patients'currentstateofhealthand
time-tradeoffutilitydatawerecollectedatadmissiononlyin
phase I. Information bias was minimized by extensive train-
ing and supervision of chart abstractors and interviewers.46
DATA ANALYSES
Continuous and discrete variables are described using me-
dian (25th, 75th percentiles) and categorical data by per-
centages. Repeated measures analyses of variance (ANOVA)
and ANOVA of contrast variables were used to describe
change of HRQL in time. Wilcoxon 2-sample test was used
for multiple pairwise comparisons to investigate how miss-
ing data influenced HRQL outcomes. The  level selection
with Bonferroni correction (.05/16=.003) was used for mul-
tiple comparisons. All analyses were performed on a micro-
computer using a commercially available statistical pack-
age (SAS for PC, Version 6.11, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

Data about the prevalence of hypertension were
not gathered. The presumed cause of CHF was most
often documented to be ischemia (45.3%), hyperten-
sion (17.3%), or toxicity (6.3%). A history of ventricu-
lar tachycardia or fibrillation was found in 16.1% of
patients; 91.7% had a normal Glasgow Coma Scale
score of 15. Of the 115 patients who did not have a
normal Glasgow Coma Scale score, 60 patients
(52.2%) had a score of 14; 13 (11.3%) had a score of
13; 21 (18.3%) had a score of 0; and 21 (18.3%) had
scores ranging from 3 to 12. The admission physical
examination reflected a population with the following
multiple findings representing severe CHF: 78.5%,
rales; 48.8%, elevated jugular venous pressure; and
57.0%, peripheral edema. Nonsinus rhythm was
detected on an electrocardiogram in 28.0% of patients.
On chest radiography, 25.0% of patients had signs of
pulmonary edema, and 61.4% had cardiomegaly.
Median Acute Physiology Score was 24 (16, 33).16,33 Of
the 509 patients (36.6%) who had such information
recorded in the chart, median left ventricular ejection
fraction was 20% (15%, 29%) (Table 1). Medications
used before study admission are presented in the fol-
lowing tabulation:

-blocker 82 (5.9)
Non­digitalis inotropic medication 40 (2.9)
Warfarin sodium 280 (20.1)
Antiarrhythmic medication 254 (18.3)
During study admission, 304 patients (21.9%) re-
ceived intravenous non­digitalis inotropic medication.
Before study entry, most patients were independent in
their daily activities; 2 weeks before hospitalization, the
median number of ADL dependencies was 0 (0, 2
[n=1136]), and the median DASI score was 16.5 (13.5,
21.0 [n=1148]). A typical patient with a DASI score of
16 would be able to walk indoors around the house and
perform light work such as dusting and washing dishes
but be unable to walk a block on level ground or climb a
flight of stairs. The median probability of surviving 60
and 180 days as estimated by each patient's own physi-
cian was 84% (78%, 89%) and 74% (65%, 81%), respec-
tively.
MEDICAL OUTCOMES AND RESOURCE USE
Median length of hospital stay was 8 (5, 12) days.
Median TISS score was 13 (9, 18 [n=1365]). A typical
patient with a TISS score of 13 would have, during 24
hours, a central vein catheter, chronic heparin infusion,
additional scheduled intravenous medication, active
diuresis for fluid overload, oxygen via nasal cannula,
continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, vital sign
checks every 2 hours, urinary catheter, and standard
input and output measurement. The median cost of
hospital care per person during the index admission
was $6275 ($3468, $13 366 [n=1303]). During the
study admission, 239 patients (17.2%) had a do-not-
resuscitate order documented in the chart. Six hundred
nine patients (43.8%) had been in intensive care units.
Median length of stay in an intensive care unit for these
patients was 4 (3, 7) days.
Whereas 1299 patients (93.4%) survived their hos-
pital stay, survival decreased to 1255 (90.3%) at 30 days,
1165 (83.8%) at 60 days, 1013 (72.9%) at 180 days, and
855 (61.5%) at 1 year. Patients who were discharged or
died within 48 hours of study entry were not included
in these analyses in accordance with study exclusion
criteria. Of the 1279 patients who survived the index
admission and had information available regarding dis-
position after discharge, 1184 (92.6%) returned home.
The remaining patients were discharged to a nursing
home (40 [3.1%]), a hospice program (6 [0.5%]), a
rehabilitation hospital (29 [2.3%]), or another acute
care hospital (20 [1.6%]).
HRQL OUTCOMES
Overall quality of life as assessed by patients (or their
surrogates, if patient data were incomplete or missing)
was reported to be good, very good, or excellent in

397 (35.7%) of 1112 patients at study admission, 447
(49.3%) of 907 patients 60 days after the index admis-
sion, and 442 (58.2%) of 760 patients 180 days after
the index admission (Table 2). At study admission
(phase I only), 60 days, and 180 days, median patient-
rated health values were 54 (49, 70 [n=549]), 60 (50,
75 [n=869]), and 60 (50, 80 [n=734]), respectively.
Frequencies of health rating values are presented in
Table 2. Median numbers of months of excellent
health patients were willing to accept rather than live a
full year in their current state of health were 10 (7.5,
12) at study admission (n=562, phase I), 11 (9.3, 12)
at 60 days (n=665), and 1110,12 at 180 days (n=615).
The time-tradeoff utility can be calculated as follows
at study admission: 10/12 (7.5/12, 12/12) or 0.83
(0.63, 1.00). More than one third of the patients
(35.9% at 60 days and 37.6% at 180 days) were
unwilling to give up any time in their current health
state to live a shorter time in excellent health (Table
2). The frequency distribution of dependencies of ADL
presented in Table 2 shows that 59.7% of patients with
available information were independent in their ADL
throughout 180 days of follow-up, with a median of 0
(0, 2 [n=909]) at 60 days and 0 (0, 1 [n=767]) at 180
days. Median SIP score was 16.3 (8.6, 26.2) at 60 days
after study admission (n=620).
CHANGE OF HRQL IN TIME
Change of HRQL in time among patients depends on the
following factors: (1) HRQL of individual patients may
change; (2) change of HRQL of the group may be influ-
enced by missing values; and (3) change may be due to
chance.
Change of HRQL measurement values among the pa-
tients with available data at all 3 times is presented in
Table 3. Health perceptions among the patients with avail-
able interview data improved at 60 and 180 days after acute
exacerbation of severe CHF. We did not detect change in
functional capacity as measured by the Index of ADL.
Table 4 presents how missing data influence the
change of HRQL of the patients hospitalized for acute ex-
acerbation of severe CHF. Patients with worse func-
tional capacity (higher Index of ADL) at admission or at
60 days after hospitalization were more likely to die. There
was a nonsignificant trend for worse health perceptions
to be related to higher mortality rates throughout the
study. At 60 days, lower time-tradeoff utility and worse
overall quality of life were significantly (P.003) re-
lated to higher mortality rates. Patients who survived the
interval (from admission to 60 days or from 60 to 180
days) and did not complete the interview after did not
differ significantly by HRQL outcomes (measured in the
previous interval) from patients who completed the in-
terview.
COMMENT
Patients hospitalized for an acute exacerbation of severe
CHF have a generally poor prognosis for survival and have
substantial resource consumption; however, survivors
have relatively good functional status and health percep-
tions. The knowledge that HRQL, particularly func-
tional status, is relatively preserved among survivors of
this population may be important to the patient and the
health care provider for making health care decisions.
Health perceptions (as assessed by general health rat-
ing, overall quality of life, and time-tradeoff utility) im-
prove among survivors after acute exacerbation of CHF.
Our study demonstrates that HRQL is measurable for large
numbers of patients hospitalized with severe CHF and
provides baseline HRQL data and change of HRQL in time
for this population.
We found 90-day and 1-year survival to be 80.8%
and 61.5%, respectively. The Framingham Heart Study16
evaluated survival data from diagnosis of clinical CHF
(not related to hospitalization, data from 1950s-1980s)
and found, for women and men, 90-day survival to be
72% and 73%, respectively, and 1-year survival to be 64%
and 57%, respectively. Surprisingly, survival appears to
be similar in the Framingham Heart Study and SUP-
PORT, despite very different inclusion criteria. Im-
proved medical management of CHF is a possible expla-
nation for the similar survival rates.

The SUPPORT patients remained relatively inde-
pendent in their daily living; at 6 months, 59.7% of pa-
tients with complete data were independent in their ba-
sic activities of daily living and 15.8% were dependent
in only 1 activity. We did not detect a change in func-
tional capacity in time. This may have been related to the
fact that the study admission baseline interview as-
sessed patients' ADL status 2 weeks before hospital ad-
mission, so a possible change between in-hospital and
postdischarge ADL status could have been missed.
Sixty days after study admission, patients in our study
had a median SIP score of 16.3. By comparison, ambu-
latory patients with chronic stable angina (n=389; mean
age, 60.4 years) had better perceived health status with
a mean SIP score of 10.5.64 In another study, 6 months
after discharge from an intensive care unit, 69 patients
had an average SIP score of 10.7.65
In our study, 66.3% (at 60 days) and 59.8% (at 6
months) of the analyzed patients with severe CHF rated
their health at 70 or lower, with the mean score of 61.6
at 60 days and 63.7 at 180 days. Survivors of myocardial
infarction (n=80; mean age, 59.9 years) with left ven-
tricular ejection fraction of less than 40% and New York
Heart Association class I to III had mean health ratings
ranging from 68 to 70.66 A random sample of the gen-
eral population ages 55 to 74 years had a mean health
rating of 75.1 (n=753).67 Stewart et al57 reported health
perceptions of 11 186 ambulatory patients (mean age, 47
years) on a scale of 0 to 100; 52% had scores of 70 or
lower (mean=63.0; SD=26.8). Mean health perception
scores (scale, 0-100) have been reported to be 74.6 in the
general population (n=2008) in the Medical Outcomes
Study57 and 59.2 in ambulatory patients with CHF
(n=297).14 Although those studies14,57 used a slightly dif-
ferent method,57 the comparison suggests that health per-
ceptions of our study patients may be somewhat lower
than those of the general population but similar to per-
ceptions found among ambulatory patients with CHF.

in SUPPORT were 0.76, 0.83, and 0.84 (at study admis-
sion, at 60 days, and at 180 days, respectively), which is
comparable to the results among patients with milder
CHF.49,66 Survivors of myocardial infarction (n=80; mean
age, 59.9 years) with left ventricular ejection fraction of less
than 40% (New York Heart Association class, I-III) had a

10.4 months in our study.66 The mean time-tradeoff score
was 0.88 and did not change during the 11/2 years of fol-
low-up in survivors of myocardial infarction.66 A random
sample of the general population ages 55 to 74 years had a
mean time-tradeoff score of 0.85 (n=738).67
Health perceptions (health rating, overall quality of
life, and time-tradeoff utility) improved among survi-
vors after acute exacerbation of CHF. This could be a re-
flection of recovering health status from an acute event
or an improvement from a previously stable but lower level
of health perception.
TheStudiesofLeftVentricularDysfunction15 andDe-
partmentofVeteransAffairsCooperativeVasodilator­Heart
Failure Trial II19 were 2 large clinical trials finding no sub-
stantialdifferencesinHRQLmeasurementsamongpatients
receiving therapies for CHF previously shown to improve
survival. Other studies17-18,69-71 have found differences in
HRQL of patients with CHF receiving different therapies.
Missing data are a common problem when using sur-
vey methods to measure HRQL.15,19,38,57 Consistent with
other studies,15,38,57 we found that living patients who failed
to complete the admission interviews were older (me-
dian age, 71 vs 66 years; P=.001 [Wilcoxon 2-sample
test]), had worse Acute Physiology Scores (median score,
31 vs 28; P.001 [Wilcoxon 2-sample test]), and had
lower 180-day survival (67% vs 77%; P.001 [2 test]).
Most studies15,19,38,57,69 excluded patients with missing or
incomplete data from analyses. This practice may create
biased samples. To minimize bias, Stewart et al57 sug-
gested imputation from other information. As described

in the "Subjects and Methods" section, we substituted
HRQL data to increase the available sample size and to
decrease possible bias associated with the correlation of
disease severity and missing data.
It is often difficult to compare HRQL of patients with
CHF across studies because there is no agreement about
strict criteria for CHF, and because the HRQL measures
used are not always the same. The instruments used in this
study(DASI,SIP,IndexofADL,generalhealthstatusscales,
and health utility) have been shown previously to be valid
andreliable.14,45,51-55,57-59 Thestudypopulation,however,was
limited to patients with severe CHF. We do not know
whether outcomes would be different in patients with less
severe disease. In addition, only 5 large teaching hospitals
participated in the study; therefore, the results may not be
generalizabletopatientsseeninsmallerornonteachinghos-
pitals or nursing homes or to patients with exacerbation
of CHF who are not hospitalized. The racial distribution
of the study patients, however, is similar to that of the gen-
eralUSpopulation.72 Arecentpopulation-basedstudy73 sug-
gests that patients who were enrolled in SUPPORT tended
to be younger and male, had fewer ADL impairments, and
experienced lower mortality rates compared with patients
with similar severity of disease from the same geographi-
cal area who were not enrolled into the study.
Our study provides insight into hospital resource
use, HRQL, change of HRQL in time, and survival of a
large patient population hospitalized for acute exacer-
bation of severe CHF. These data demonstrate that pa-
tients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of severe CHF
have a generally poor prognosis for survival during the
ensuing 6 months, but survivors have relatively good func-
tional status and health perceptions. Furthermore, the
health perceptions improve among survivors after acute
exacerbation of CHF. Patients with worse functional ca-
pacity are more likely to die, however. The results of our
study are more generalizable to those (generally younger)
patients who receive a more aggressive approach (in-
cluding hospitalization) for exacerbation of CHF.
