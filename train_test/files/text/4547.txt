The human personality is a sacred thing; one dare not violate it
nor infringe its bounds, while at the same time the greatest good
is in communion with others.

Introduction
Attitudes toward electronic communication have changed
dramatically in a brief period of time. Just 3 years ago,
Holmes, Moroney, and Holder (2009) found that the number
one electronic communication preference was email, a form
of communication that hardly existed a decade prior
(Stepanikova, Nie, & He, 2010). In this same short time
span, words such as "friend" have changed their meaning
(Ledbetter et al., 2011), and words such as "friended,"
"texting," and "texted" became words either used colloqui-
ally or have entered the Webster dictionary. These most
recent words reflect the actual and now the most generally
used current communication method across genders and age
groups, as reflected in this study.
Whether social networking or electronic communication
has been a positive or negative influence on relationships
has been much debated (Baym, Zhang, & Lin, 2004;
Caplan, 2007; Mazer, Murphy, & Simonds, 2007; McKenna,
Green, & Gleason, 2002; Ramirez & Broneck, 2009;
Spitzberg, 2006) in the past decade and is still explored in
more recent research, with foundational research reflected
in quite old studies. Sheldon, Abad, and Hinsch (2011)
pointed to the two extreme views (online communication
being either positive or negative) but contend that the real-
ity is more nuanced.
Online Support System
Social networking can provide support among people who
already have an in-person network in place. However, one
can find specific support networks for everything from infer-
tility, surrogacy, rare genetic disorders, addictions, and other
specific groups in increasing frequency. Such groups of sup-
port do not require that people have a face-to-face relation-
ship to be a part of their support. Among Facebook "friends,"
Moreno et al. (2011) found that when users displayed depres-
sive posts, they found support through their friend network,
and others were more likely to support them through discus-
sions of their own similar feelings. Whether Forest and
Wood's (2012) finding that people spend time with only 24%
of their Facebook friend network is interpreted in a positive,

Of Course I Don't Post Too Much:
Preferences and Perceptions of
Relational Maintenance Online
Kristie Holmes1
Abstract
This study explored participant perception regarding the ease of relationship maintenance online, honesty in information
sharing, and whether people were more, less, or similarly concerned about their online image over their in-person image
given the prevalence and preference for electronic communication in most relationship forms. Most of the 296 participants
were consistently honest in their online information sharing. Women were more likely to worry about maintaining their
in-person image than men and found it easier to maintain friendships online. Participants aged 30 to 45 years were the least
likely to post misleading information about themselves or their interests. Participants seemed to equate "post a lot" of
information online as equated to "post too much" as not a single participant revealed that they "post a lot."

neutral, or negative light, it is certainly likely to affect
relationships, depending on how time is allocated to online
versus face-to-face primary relationships.
Hypothesis 1: Men will rate the ease of online relationship
maintenance as easier than their female counterparts.
Seeking Romantic Partners
Permanent partnerships such as marriage as a result of meet-
ing online are no longer a rarity. The dating website eHar-
mony boasts an average of 100,000 marriages per year
through their service alone. A small-scale study by Young,
Dutta, and Dommety (2009) explored extracting psycho-
logical information from Facebook user profiles, for
instance, that an assumption could be made about users who
posted a religious affiliation. Such users were more likely to
be single, and this was seen as an important factor in looking
for a potential mate as opposed to users who did not post a
religious affiliation, as is making one's profile public (invit-
ing communication from outside their "network").
Wang et al. (2011) explored the regrets that social net-
working users feel about past information sharing and found
that regrettable postings were not unusual for users, and they
centered around sensitive topics, emotions, and unintended
viewers of their posts. Results demonstrated real-life ramifi-
cations for users in terms of relationships and careers that are
indeed negative. Ellison, Steinfield, and Lampe's (2007)
findings from an earlier time found that psychological well-
being was enhanced for participants who were experiencing
low self-esteem or life satisfaction.
Hypothesis 2: Disclosure of personal information will be
positively correlated with in-person disclosure and
negatively associated with online disclosure.
Diagnosable Internet Addiction
Sheldon et al.'s (2011) study opened with, "Facebooking has
become near-epidemic in college populations" (p. 1), and
questioned whether it was actually an obsession that disrupts
or consumes lives. Meerkerk, Van Den Eijnden, Vermulst,
and Garretsen (2009) even developed an instrument to assess
the severity of compulsive online use and found that "inter-
net addiction" is increasingly recognized as a valid construct
(p. 5). Kim, LaRose, and Peng (2009) found that those who
were already lonely or felt depressed or lacked social skills
could in fact develop compulsive Internet usage, increasing
symptom severity rather than relieving it through online con-
nections. They also found that undergraduate students fre-
quently underestimated how their peers were feeling as a
result of what they viewed on Facebook, resulting in more
negative feelings about themselves after logging off (Jordan
et al., 2011). Furthermore, it was found that even when users
with low self-esteem used social networking as a less
frightening way to express themselves, the items posted were
generally not well received by others, making it difficult to
connect through this medium in the desired way (Forest &
Wood, 2012).
Hypothesis 3: With increasing age, the amount of time
spent on online will decrease.
However, similar questions could have been asked of his-
torical participants who began using the telephone "compul-
sively" or "multiple times in the span of one day." An
argument could be made that one was "addicted" to any new
gadget that had entered one's life before the novelty wore
off. Easy access and the lack of cost deterrent for those who
already have Internet access may make reining in compul-
sive actions more difficult, and the potential for "stalking" in
relationships (or just a potential romantic interest) can also
more easily run amok in this climate given the access one has
to information on just about anyone through a quick Google
search.
Whereas someone in the past may not have made a physi-
cal "drive by" of an ex-partner's home, they may be far more
likely to check their social networking information, or ask a
mutual friend to pull their information. Tokunaga (2011)
called this "interpersonal electronic surveillance." This type
of access could bring an onslaught of information that in the
past would have been unlikely (i.e., vacation photos with the
new partner, what their children look like and where they
work, as well as what they had for breakfast that morning)
but are all possibilities at this time and could cause psycho-
logical stress and jealously when it would have not been pos-
sible before, especially for those who are anxiously attached
to their partners (Elphinston & Noller, 2011). Marshall,
Bejanyan, Di Castro, and Lee (2012) found that anxiety
related to relationship status was positively related with
Facebook surveillance.
Oversharing and Safety Concerns
Back et al. (2010) supported the theory that most people are
fairly honest in their portrayal of themselves and are not
using profiles to promote an idealized virtual identity as
many had feared in the past would happen, reflecting on the
anonymity of the Internet. Fernandez, Levinson, and
Rodebaugh (2012) suggested that social anxiety is indeed
recognizable in objective criteria posted on Facebook as well
as raters' impressions. It seems that people are even more
willing to put more "out there" in many cases (especially in
younger demographics) than they would say or do in a physi-
cal or face-to-face capacity. For younger adults, it seems that
they may be more willing to reveal information that could
place them at risk with regard to personal safety. Nosko,
Wood, and Molema (2010) found that as age increased, the
amount of disclosure regarding personal information in their
profiles decreased.
Holmes 3
Hypothesis 4: Male anxiety scores related to image (online
and offline) will be lower than that of their female
counterparts.
Hypothesis 5: Younger adult anxiety scores related to
image (including online and offline concerns) will be
lower than that of middle- and older age participants.
Social Networking's Historical Context
This researcher was interested in exploring the more nuanced
features of the online relationship in all relational forms:
strangers, casual questioning, friendships, and romantic rela-
tionships. Sheldon et al. (2011) went on to state that during
their literature review, they found that the studies to date had
revealed that with greater social networking use, there was a
greater sense of relationship satisfaction as well as dissatis-
faction and bipolar feelings of connectedness. The extreme
language employed by researchers to describe social net-
working use could be seen as overwrought at this time.
Studies such as Ledbetter et al. (2011) reviewed literature
that connected poor social skills as a reason to prefer to use
electronic forms of communication. This may have well
been true when the use of Facebook to communicate was not
ubiquitous, as it is today. In today's relationships, even
acquaintanceships, it is not uncommon to state or even
assume in the beginning of a face-to-face conversation that
the parties involved already know certain information
"because I already saw it on Facebook" or may start a con-
versation by saying something like, "Did you see what Mary
posted on her wall?"
Using social networking is more often than not an
expected part of interpersonal communication that fills in
many blanks in a way that perhaps a phone conversation
would have in the past, bridging the gap until the next face-
to-face meeting. Also, if one states in a conversation, "I
talked with Mary about such and such last week," it would
not necessarily mean that she actually "spoke" with her in
person or on the phone, but could have been involved in a
text message "conversation" or another form of electronic
communication. Similarly, speaking to someone about one's
"Facebook friend" and what someone "said" or "did" may
not actually mean that a person has had any face-to-face con-
tact with the sharer. At this point with social networking's
infusion with face-to-face life, it can now be taken as a social
slight if someone has missed an important milestone or
announcement made on one's social networking site and if
one is considered "close" to this sharer.
Social Networking As a Romantic Antagonist
More recently, Facebook has been a great antagonist to
romantic relationships, with a 2010 study by American
Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (AAML) having found
that "four out of five lawyers reported an increasing number
of divorce cases citing evidence derived from social
networking sites in the past 5 years, with Facebook being the
market leader." Furthermore, "Two-thirds of the lawyers sur-
veyed said that Facebook was the `primary source' of evi-
dence in divorce proceedings" (Adams, 2011).
Muise, Christofides, and Desmarais (2009) stated that the
open nature of social networking gives couples access to
information they would have not had otherwise, and the lack
of context often showed the reader how their partner knows
a certain person or what sort of conversation they are having.
Given the permanent nature of items posted on the Internet,
it may be that in the future, answers will evolve and change
in studies with regard to the perceived positive or negative
effect of social networking on relationships. Young adults are
building a longer and more permanent history of actions,
opinions, photos, activities, and relationships with more
information available to potential friends, spouses, and
employers that can affect their present relationships and
future opportunities.
Social Network Analysis Theory
Social network analysis is grounded in the systematic analy-
sis of empirical data, although it was once seen as a method
of inquiry rather than a stand-alone theory. People now
actively think of their social networks (how and who they are
connected to in real life) the way sociologists have for many
decades because of the influence of online social networks
such as Facebook and Twitter. These networks have long
been researched by sociologists as an acknowledged way to
maintain relationships (Keller, 1968), share information, and
fit in with those surrounding oneself in a community
(Freeman, 2004). The biggest difference in then and now is
the ease with which one is included in or isolated from par-
ticular networks and the easier tracking by researchers with
an eye for electronic data mining that is now available in
numbers that would have been incomprehensible 30 years
ago (Butts, 2009). Wellman (2004) stated, "Thirty years ago,
I could not even sell the term `social network' to sociolo-
gists" (p. 2).
Granovetter (1973) defined a tie and its strength as related
to an investment of time, emotional intensity, mutual confi-
dence, and reciprocity. Festinger, Schachter, and Back (1950)
simplified the idea of propinquity by showing that the term
meant that, in the simplest terms, people befriend their neigh-
bors. Festinger's (1950) social comparison theory ties in fur-
ther with how people view themselves (and the contents of
one's social networking profile) with regard to their felt per-
ceptions about how others are superior or inferior to
themselves.
Still, however, even with all of the data available, it
seems that people's networks, although globally available in
a way never before imagined, still generally support very
localized relationships (within driving distance). Rather
than "the end of geography" (Graham, 1998) as we know it,
at this point, it appears that while the availability helps one
4 SAGE Open
forge new connections, at its core, electronic social net-
working in many ways continues to reflect the way things
have historically been, with relationships online reflecting
the connections one has face to face. People continue to
make comparisons of themselves in relationship with others
in the community. This study explores what this researcher
views as simply a newer mode of communication and how
participants perceive its role in supporting or taking away
from relationships. How close ties are to begin with may
play a role, as Gilbert (2012) suggested, in that the perceived
ease or difficulty may depend on the intimacy of the rela-
tionship in the first place. It was suspected by this researcher
that, in the end, while technology changes at a rapid pace as
do the options available to communicate, the more intimate
the relationship, the more likely the desire to prefer face-to-
face interaction. Takhteyev, Gruzd, and Wellman (2012)
stated simply, "Social contacts benefit from physical prox-
imity" (p. 1).
Method
An online survey was distributed through Facebook via a
web-based platform, targeting ages 18 and above. Participants
of this age range were chosen because the researcher was
interested in exploring adult communicative styles through
the use of technology and how the independent variables of
age, gender, geographical location, and marital history affect
how one perceives the effect of technology on relationships
whether they be strangers, platonic friendships, or romantic
partnerships. Participants were from 38 states in the United
States, while 24 participants resided outside of the United
States, with a 92% response rate. This sample was heavily
Caucasian and well educated. The survey consisted primarily
of closed-ended quantitative questions.
Of the 296 participants, 81 identified as male, 209 identi-
fied as female, 1 identified as "other," and 5 declined to
answer the question. During analysis, the researcher decided
to eliminate the responses from the participant who identi-
fied with the "other" category to restrict the research analysis
to two sexes as opposed to three when exploring gender.
Participants were asked to respond to 28 multiple-choice
questions by selecting a single answer they felt best reflected
their opinion and 1 open-ended question where they could
describe their opinion in their own words with regard to how
they view the positive, neutral, or negative effects of technol-
ogy on their relationships. The survey was designed with a
nonoptional informed consent agreement, which stated that
participants must be above the age of 18 to take the survey. It
also made it clear that the survey was completely voluntary
and anonymous, and included contact information for the
Institutional Review Board (IRB) as well as for the research-
ers so that participants were able to pose questions, com-
ments, or complaints if needed. IP addresses were not
collected, and with the exception of the informed consent
agreement, every item was voluntary and could be skipped
without interrupting the rest of the survey. The snowball
sampling technique was used to encourage Facebook users
to repost the survey link on their pages to further distribute
the survey.
Twitter was used to further disseminate the survey as
well as professional contact emails that went out to the
researcher's network as a separate collector of data.
Statistical tests used were independent t tests, ANOVA, least
significant difference (LSD), and Bonferonni post hoc tests
(including Pplot graphs), as well as descriptive statistics and
chi-square to analyze results, using (SPSS) IBM 19.0 soft-
ware. Significance was set at p  .05. However, there were
many instances when there were levels of p = .06 or .07
levels of significance, which this researcher considered as
borderline significance in these findings and therefore
reportable.
Results
"I Do Not Post Too Much Personal Information"
One of the most stunning findings in this study, without hav-
ing run a single statistical analysis, was the glaringly obvious
lack of responses to one question option in particular regard-
less of gender, age, or marital status. When participants were
asked to rate their level of posting information about them-
selves online (options were that they post no personal infor-
mation, post a little, post moderately, or post a lot), with N =
296, not one single participant chose "post a lot." The major-
ity of participants (60%) stated that they post "a little," while
30% stated that they post a moderate amount. Those who
claimed to post no personal information about themselves
came in at 17%.
Gender Differences
Ease of Maintaining Friendships Online
When participants were asked about the ease of maintain-
ing friendships online, men found it more difficult to do so
(n = 74, M = 2.02, SD = .84) than women (n = 199, M =
1.79, SD = .85). This difference was statistically signifi-
cant, t(271) = 0.22, p = .05.
Concern Level of Offline Image
When participants were questioned about the level of con-
cern they have for their offline image, men were less con-
cerned with how their image appears to others in the "real
world" (n = 74, M = 2.25, SD = .92) than women (n = 193, M
= 2.55, SD = .83). This difference was statistically signifi-
cant, t(265) = -0.29, p = .01. When questioned about their
level of concern with constantly trying to present and main-
tain an image of themselves online, there was not a statisti-
cally significant difference among genders.
Holmes 5
Distrust of What Others Post Online
When participants were asked how often they trusted the
honesty of others who posted personal information online,
men were less trusting (n = 74, M = 2.98, SD = .73) than
women (n = 194, M = 3.14, SD = .61). This mean difference
had borderline significance, t(266) = -0.163, p = .06.
Age Differences
Posted Misleading Information
Age categories were coded into three groups: 18 to 29 years,
30 to 45 years, and 46 years and older. ANOVA was run
along with LSD and Bonferonni post hoc tests, F(2, 264) =
6.38, p = .00, and found that there were significant differ-
ences between the youngest group aged 18 to 29 and the
middle group aged 30 to 45 (M difference = 0.31, p = .004)
as well as the oldest group aged 46 and older (M difference =
0.18, p = 03) when asked about the level of posting mislead-
ing personal information about themselves online. The range
of misleading posting was 1 (never) to 4 (frequently). The
eldest group mean was 1.28, the middle group mean was
1.15 (making them the least likely group to post misleading
information about themselves online), and the youngest
group was the most likely group to mislead others with a
mean of 1.46.
Level of Concern With
Offline Versus Online Image
When participants were questioned about the level of con-
cern they have for their offline image, age was a deciding
variable in determining how concerned they were. The older
the participant, the less concerned they were with how their
image appeared to others in the "real world."
When questioned about their level of concern with con-
stantly trying to present and maintain an image of themselves
online, ANOVA, LSD, and Bonferonni post hoc tests, F(2,
265) = 9.11, p = .00, were run and it was found that there
were no significant differences between the youngest group
aged 18 to 29 and the middle group aged 30 to 45 (M differ-
ence = 0.31, p = .004), but there was a significant difference
between the youngest and the oldest group aged 46 and older
(M difference = 0.52, p = 00.) of concern levels regarding
their offline image. There was also a significant difference
between the middle group (30-45 years) and the older group
(above the age of 46; M difference = 0.32, p = .01).
The range of concern in trying to present and maintain
one's offline image was 1 (not at all concerned) to 4
(extremely concerned). The oldest group's mean was 2.21,
the middle group's mean was 2.53, and the youngest group
had the highest level of concern with a mean of 2.73. It seems
that the older the participants, the less was their level of con-
cern about the maintenance of their offline (in-person) image.
This was expected. However, there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference when online image alone was analyzed.
Level of Personal Disclosure
When age categories were coded into three age groups, the
researcher ran ANOVA, LSD, and Bonferonni post hoc tests,
F(2, 267) =5.45, p = .00, and found that there were no signifi-
cant differences between the youngest group aged 18 to
29 years and the middle group aged 30 to 45 years when
looking at levels of personal disclosure posts online.
There was a statistically significant difference between
the youngest group (18-29 years) and the oldest group (above
the age of 46) when rating the level of personal information
they post about themselves online (M difference = 0.29, p =
.001). There was also a statistically significant difference
between the middle group (aged 30-45 years) and the oldest
group (above the age of 46) and their rated level of disclosure
(M difference = 0.18, p = .04). The oldest group also had a
statistically significant difference between both of the other
groups (18-29 years; M difference = -0.29, p = .001) and
30 to 45 age group (M difference = -0.18, p = .04).
The range of misleading posting was 1 (never post) to
4 (post a lot). The eldest group's mean was 1.91, the middle
group's mean was 2.09, and the youngest group was the most
likely group of frequent posters with a mean of 2.21.
Time Spent on Social Networking Sites
After running ANOVA, LSD, and Bonferonni post hoc tests,
F(2, 284) = 13.73, p = .00, it was found that there were sig-
nificant differences between the youngest group aged 18 to
29, and the middle group aged 30 to 45 (M difference = 0.53,
p = .001), as well as the oldest group aged 46 and older
(M difference = 0.73, p = 00) when accounting for time spent
on social networking sites. The range of hours spent was 1
(less than an hour per day) to 6 (more than 8 hr per day). The
eldest group's mean was 1.58, the middle group's mean was
1.79, and the youngest group, with a mean of 2.32, was the
group that spent the most time on social networking sites.
This was expected.
Image Maintenance:
Combined Offline and Online
This researcher explored the possibility of a statistical sig-
nificance between age groups (ANOVA), marital status
(t test), and gender (t test) on a combined image maintenance
variable, combining online and offline variables related to
image maintenance. An ANOVA, F(2, 265) = 4.34, p = .014,
found that there were significant differences between the
youngest group aged 18 to 29 years and the oldest group
aged 56 and older (M difference = 0.64, p = .004). The range
of image maintenance was 8 to 2. The oldest group's mean
6 SAGE Open
was 4.76, the middle group's mean was 4.5, and the youngest
group was the least concerned about image maintenance at
4.12. This was as expected.
Marital status was recoded into (ever) been married and
never married (single). The never married (single) group
(M = 4.25) was more concerned about image maintenance in
general than the group that had a marriage history. This was
statistically significant (M = 4.71, t test = 2.41, p = .012).
There was no significant statistical difference between men
and women concerning image maintenance, which was not
expected.
Posting Most Misleading Information
When exploring factors of honesty in online relationships, an
ANOVA, F(3, 263) = 5.50, p = .001, was run to determine
whether there was a relationship between the posting of mis-
leading information about oneself online and the ability to
trust what others post online. There was no statistical signifi-
cance for the group who "never" posted misleading informa-
tion about themselves online.
"I'm Rarely Dishonest"
The researcher found that there was a borderline significant
difference between the group that "rarely" posts misleading
information about themselves (M difference = 0.18, p = .07)
and their level of trust in others' posts. Statistical signifi-
cance increased in this group when the researcher looked at
an increased level of trust ("frequently" trusted others online
when they rarely posted misleading information; M differ-
ence = 0.42, p = .000). The range of trust was 4 to 1.
"I'm Sometimes Dishonest"
Statistical significance increased in the group that admitted
to "sometimes" posting misleading information about them-
selves (Level 3) when the researcher looked at an increased
level of trust ("frequently" trusted others online when they
sometimes posted misleading information; M difference =
0.24, p = .003). The range of trust was 4 to 1. Not a single
participant reported being frequently dishonest. The high-
level trust group's mean was 1.10, the moderate-level trust
group's mean was 1.34, the rarely trusting group mean was
1.52, and the never trust others online group mean was 1.00.
This was not expected.
Limitations and Future Research
Future studies should aim to gather a more diverse, ran-
dom racial sample, as this study reflects that of well-
educated Caucasians albeit those with varying age levels
rather than a simple undergraduate convenience sample. It
seems that qualitative answers on this subject matter yield
more of a negative theme related to the relationship effect
of electronic relationship maintenance than do quantitative
studies. Thus, exploring how to mitigate some of these
issues may be helpful especially to those who work in
fields where participants are directly affected by relation-
ships unraveling, when online infidelity or family drama is
a result of such ways of communicating, or "catching"
loved ones in the act of speaking badly about another or
more intimately with another than appropriate. It also
seems that an overarching theme of reasoning behind using
social networks is a positive one that encompasses the
simple need to "stay in touch with friends and family."
However, the actual qualitative statements reflect more
trauma of an unexpected type that has an overriding effect
on many people day after day, especially given the perma-
nence of many items that have gone online, even after user
deletion.

Discussion
"Of Course I Don't Post Too Much"
The most surprising finding in this study was participant
denial, for the most part, of posting "a lot" of information
about themselves online. Overwhelmingly, participants
stated that they post "a little." This seems to reflect the feel-
ing of participants that posting "a lot" must equate to posting
"too much" and one simply does not do that. Most readers
can easily tell from their own Facebook friends or other
social networking lists that there are at least a handful that
consistently post what most would consider "too much." One
may also consider that this participant group answered an
online survey that may make them even more likely to have
frequent online activity of some sort. Age was also a factor;
with increasing age, there was decreased reporting of posting
frequency as supported by Hypothesis 3.
Women See Things Differently From Men
Women in general find it easier to maintain friendships
online, as most can see visually on their own Facebook time-
lines when one weighs in on their own ratio of personal
"friend" posts. However, women are more concerned about
their in-person (offline) image than their male counterparts
are. This result may not come as a surprise as was supported
by Hypothesis 4. However, when you shift to online image,
there was no difference between genders in their levels of
concern about how others viewed them based on their posted
information. In contrast to Hypothesis 1, women found it
easier to maintain relationships online than their male coun-
terparts. Furthermore, men were also less likely to trust
information posted by others.
Least Likely to Mislead Others
Interestingly, people aged 30 to 45 years were the least likely
to post misleading information about themselves online such
as appearance, interests, and age. This may be due to the fact
that this group is less likely to be looking to impress others
(romantically). This researcher theorized that this may well
be that this is the age group more likely to be focused on
family and raising children and perhaps are less likely to be
concerned about their online image or finding a mate in con-
trast to Hypothesis 5, which would have found participants
aged 30 to 45 years old as more concerned about their image
than those ages older than 46 years. However, it seems that
the oldest age category has more concern about their image
than those in their middle years do.
Women aged 30 to 45 years are more likely to be posting
photos of their children and other family-related milestones
(Watkins & Lee, 2010), and men are more likely to post news
stories of interest. If users are a single parent, they may be
more likely to be honest about this information up front to
avoid unwarranted confusion about status and relationship
type. Furthermore, it may be that once children leave the
home, there is more focus on oneself.
Concern Level With Offline Versus Online Image
Although there was not a statistically significant difference
according to age group among participants when responding
to the question about their level of concern with their offline
image, this is expected to change over time. As people begin
to realize how terribly permanent their online "records" are,
and who can access them long after a young person has for-
gotten about things they or "friends" have posted on
Facebook, Twitter, or other social networking sites, they
have the potential to come back later in life and effect job
status, interviews, insurance claims, and even personal rela-
tionships. These types of effects are only beginning to rear
their ugly head in the popular media and have been playing
themselves out in divorce cases at staggering rates.
Being Dishonest As a Fantasy Buy-In
One would expect that if people were purposefully dishonest
about themselves, they would be less likely to trust others'
posted information. However, it seems that the inverse is
true. Perhaps the lack of in-person contact gives a feeling of
license to be a bit more loose with accurate personal infor-
mation and makes people who do this more willing to go
along with others' proffered representations of themselves.
Experience Equals Less Concern About Image
Maintenance
Whether one is talking about linear aging or relationship
experience, it seems that experience is an indicator of lessen-
ing anxiety over how one appears to others. Given the per-
manent nature of items posted on the Internet, it may be that
in the future, answers will evolve and change in studies with
regard to the perceived positive or negative effect of social
networking on relationships. Young adults are building a lon-
ger and more permanent history of actions, opinions, photos,
activities, and relationships with more information available
to potential friends, spouses, and employers that can affect
their present relationships and future opportunities.
Much of this may be related to Hypothesis 2, which was
supported in this study to reveal that despite ease of use and
widespread availability of the newest modes of communica-
tion to support the maintenance of relationships, as the level
of intimacy increases, likewise does the desire to communi-
cate such information in person.
