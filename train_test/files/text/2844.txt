Non-technical summary
The chief executive officer (CEO) occupies an accentuated position in a firm's decision-
making process. In this empirical study we investigate whether incoming CEOs in German
banks engage in big bath accounting during their first year in charge. Taking such an
earnings bath lowers the performance benchmark to be achieved in subsequent years. As
a poor performance in the first year is often not yet attributed to the managerial skills
of the incoming CEO, doing so does not entail any drawbacks with respect to his or her
remuneration or reputation.
Our findings from a sample of German savings banks over 1993-2012 are as follows.
We document that incoming CEOs increase discretionary expenses during their first year
in charge. Succeeding CEOs from outside the bank take a larger earnings bath than those
from the inside, and incoming CEOs take a smaller earnings bath when the incumbent
CEOs retire than when they leave for other reasons. These findings are insensitive to
several modifications. Most importantly, the results hold even when we focus on banks
that do not need to cure shortages in their existing stock of risk provisions, which may
provide an alternative explanation for observable extraordinary amounts of discretionary
expenses.
This study is ­ to the best of our knowledge ­ the first to report on big bath accounting
during CEO turnovers in the banking industry. It contributes to a better understanding
of corporate governance in financial institutions and, for stakeholders, it helps to more
correctly evaluate bank performance during turnover years.

Abstract
This study investigates the development of income-decreasing discretionary expenses
surrounding CEO turnovers at banks. We expect incoming CEOs to take an ear-
nings bath during the initial stage of their tenure. For a sample of German banks
over the period 1993-2012, we document that (1) incoming CEOs increase discretio-
nary expenses, i. e. engage in big bath accounting, during their first (partial) year in
charge, (2) incoming CEOs from outside the bank take a larger earnings bath than
insiders, and (3) incoming CEOs take a smaller earnings bath when the incumbent
CEOs retire than when they leave for other reasons. Our findings are robust to
several modifications. Most importantly, they also hold true when the incoming
CEO's objective of rectifying shortages in the existing stock of risk provisions has
been taken into account, which may provide an alternative explanation for observing
extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses in turnover years.

BUNDESBANK DISCUSSION PAPER NO 05/2014
1 Introduction
The chief executive officer (CEO) occupies an accentuated position in a firm's decision-
making process (e. g. Bertrand and Schoar (2003), Bergstresser and Philippon (2006),
Bennedsen, P´
erez-Gonz´
alez, and Wolfenzon (2010)). His or her position may be even
more emphasized during top executive turnovers. Since individuals evaluate performance
relative to a benchmark rather than in absolute terms (Kahneman and Tversky (1979)),
incoming CEOs may aim to secure their new position particularly during the initial years
of stewardship by changing the relative performance benchmark in their favor. Taking
an earnings bath (Pourciau (1993), Godfrey, Mather, and Ramsay (2003)) lowers the
performance benchmark to be achieved during subsequent accounting periods and saves
income to be used in subsequent accounting periods, without entailing any drawbacks to
the incoming CEOs with respect to their remuneration or reputation. While the literature
has investigated discretionary accounting choices during CEO turnovers at non-financial
firms (e. g. Davidson III, Biao, Weihong, and Ning (2007), Geiger and North (2006)), little
is known about financial firms. Therefore, this study is ­ to the best of our knowledge ­
the first to report on big bath accounting during CEO turnovers in the banking industry.
We investigate big bath accounting during CEO turnovers along several lines. We
start by examining whether incoming bank CEOs incur extraordinarily large amounts of
income-decreasing discretionary expenses during the initial stage of their tenure. We also
investigate differences in the propensity to engage in big bath accounting between insider
and outsider turnovers as well as between those triggered by the retirement of the former
CEO and those attributable to any other reasons, e. g. resignation or dismissal. This
is based on the conjecture that social ties between the incumbent CEO and his or her
successor, which are presumably stronger during insider and retirement turnovers than
during outsider and non-retirement ones, should restrict the scope for exerting managerial
discretion.
To flag incidents of big bath accounting during turnover years it must first be sepa-
rated from other forms of earnings management, such as income smoothing1 (Trueman
and Titman (1988)). Similar to taking an earnings bath, top executives may remedy their
1 Income smoothing refers to reducing the fluctuation of an income stream over time.
1
job security concerns by smoothing the income stream (Fudenberg and Tirole (1995)).
Several studies show that managers exert discretion on their firms' income streams in
non-financial (e. g. DeFond and Park (1997), Leuz, Nanda, and Wysocki (2003)) as well
as financial firms (e. g. Anandarajan, Hasan, Lozano-Vivas, and Sale (2003), Anandara-
jan, Hasan, and McCarthy (2007), Alali and Jaggi (2011)). Among others, Lobo and
Yang (2001), Kanagaretnam, Lobo, and Mathieu (2003), and Hasan and Wall (2004)
reveal that managers of US banks save earnings for future periods by increasing loan
loss provisions (LLP) in good times and borrow earnings from the future by releasing
LLP in bad times. We follow this literature by controlling for income smoothing efforts.
Since the literature identifies several discretionary expense items, such as loan loss ac-
cruals (e. g. Lobo and Yang (2001), Hasan and Wall (2004)), security gains and losses
(SGL) (e. g. Beatty, Chamberlain, and Magliolo (1995), Collins, Shackelford, and Wahlen
(1995), Shrieves and Dahl (2003)) and country-specific expenses (e. g. Bornemann, Kick,
Memmel, and Pfingsten (2012)) to be used for income smoothing, we use an aggregate
measure of discretionary expenses to adequately deal with all items that are subject to the
CEOs' discretion. Moreover, since the literature frequently reveals gradual adjustments
in discretionary expenses (e. g. Laeven and Majnoni (2003), Bikker and Metzemakers
(2005), P´
erez, Saurina Salas, and Salas-Fum´
as (2008)), we set up a dynamic panel data
model as a way to tackle these gradual adjustments and to distinguish between big bath
accounting and income smoothing effects.
Unfortunately, identifying larger amounts of discretionary expenses during turnover
years after tackling income smoothing does not necessarily indicate that the incoming
CEO takes an earning bath to change his or her relative performance benchmark and to
save income for future periods. In contrast to many other industries, adequate risk pro-
visioning is vital for the health of financial firms. Hence, risk provisioning considerations
on the part of the incoming CEO may cause extraordinary amounts of discretionary ex-
penses to be observable during turnover years. The incoming CEO may deem the existing
stock of risk provisions accumulated under the stewardship of his or her predecessor to be
inappropriate relative to the bank's current risk exposure. If so, he or she may be merely
incurring discretionary expenses to rectify insufficient past provisioning rather than to op-
portunistically exert managerial discretion. Therefore, we not only control for the banks'
2
risk provisions and risk exposure in our analyses, but also investigate separately big bath
accounting effects of CEOs being appointed at banks with a high stock of risk provisions
relative to the banks' risk exposure. This approach additionally sets our study apart from
those investigating big bath accounting in non-financial firms.
Our study on big bath accounting during CEO turnovers in the banking industry adds
to several parts of the literature and contributes to a better understanding of corporate
governance in financial institutions. Relevant for the contribution of our study to the
literature is that financial firms, in particular banks, differ in two important aspects from
corporate firms: First, the regulatory environment in which banks operate is unique as,
for example, the appointment of the CEO requires explicit approval by the supervisory
authority. Second, risk management of banks is in general of a higher importance than
in corporate firms which is reflected in different approaches and measures to determine
risk. Related issues have still received relatively little attention in the literature. So far,
Fiechter and Meyer (2010) are the only ones to address big bath accounting at financial
firms. While they examine fair value measurements during the recent financial crisis,
they do not focus on CEO changes. Few studies focus on executive changes at financial
institutions. Barro and Barro (1990) relate CEO pay and turnover to bank performance,
while Webb (2008) studies the effects of monitoring intensity on CEO turnovers in banks.
Most existing research on banks' governance examines the effects of different ownership
structures on bank valuation (e. g. Caprio, Laeven, and Levine (2007)) and risk-taking
(e. g. Ianotta, Nocera, and Sironi (2007)). Lately, Schaeck, Cihak, Maechler, and Stolz
(2012) reveal that bank executives are more likely to be dismissed if their bank is risky, in-
curs losses, cuts dividends, has a high charter value, and holds high levels of subordinated
debt. We add to the ongoing discussion on adequate bank governance by providing novel
evidence on big bath accounting during CEO turnovers at banks, which helps stakeholders
to appropriately evaluate reported accounting numbers during years of CEO turnovers.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 outlines incentives
for exerting managerial discretion during CEO turnovers and derives testable hypothe-
ses. Section 3 presents the data used, provides descriptive statistics, and introduces our
econometric model. Section 4 reports the results of our multivariate analysis. Section 5
winds up with some concluding remarks.

2 Hypotheses
Turnover events involve two distinct individuals: the incumbent and the incoming CEO
(Ronen and Yaari (2008)). While both may be exposed to very different incentives during
the turnover year, which is defined here as the first year in which the incoming CEO is
either already in charge of or at least able to materially influence the bank's financial
reporting, we restrict our investigation to the incoming CEO's behavior for the following
two reasons. First, he or she is able to revise decisions taken by his or her predecessor,
which makes discretion exerted by the incumbent hard to measure. Second, some CEOs
threatened by dismissal are able to evade replacement by means of extraordinary accoun-
ting choices similar to those taken during a turnover. In these cases, behavior consistent
with that preceding a change in the top executive's position would not be followed by
such a change. As we are unable to identify executives who only very narrowly evaded
replacement only, discretion exerted by the incumbent is once more hard to detect. Both
reasons may explain why previous studies (e. g. Wells (2002), Davidson III et al. (2007))
find only limited evidence of discretion exerted by the departing CEO during the turnover
year.
The incoming CEO aims to signal his or her managerial ability in order to secure the
new position particularly during the initial stage of his or her stewardship (e. g. Shen
and Cannella Jr. (2002)). According to the prospect theory of Kahneman and Tversky
(1979), individuals evaluate performance relative to a benchmark rather than in absolute
terms. Therefore, one way of securing the new position particularly during a new CEO's
initial years in charge is to meet or beat certain earnings benchmarks. The previous year's
performance has been identified as such a benchmark for non-financial (e. g. Burgstahler
and Dichev (1997), Degeorge, Patel, and Zeckhauser (1999)) as well as financial firms
(Shen and Chih (2005)).
Incurring extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses reduces the bank's net in-
come during the turnover year, which in turn lowers the benchmark to be achieved in
subsequent periods. Doing so also saves income, which is available for meeting earnings
targets in future years. This comes at the cost of a rather bad bank performance during
the turnover year. However, the incoming CEO is usually able to attribute such bad per-
4
formance, which may result from his or her income-decreasing actions, to the long-term
consequences of decisions taken or omitted by his or her predecessor. Therefore, the new
CEO does not have to fear a loss in either managerial reputation or remuneration owing
to a dissatisfactory bank performance during his or her first partial year in charge. In
addition, he or she will benefit in both regards from reaching the earnings benchmark
in the future. Therefore, the incoming CEO is strongly inclined to engage in big bath
accounting during the turnover year. We hypothesize accordingly:
Hypothesis 1: An incoming CEO builds more discretionary expenses in the turnover
year than in non-turnover years.
We expect differences in the extent of big bath accounting to prevail between turnovers
characterized by different circumstances. One of these circumstances is the professional
origin of the incoming CEO, who may either be an insider or an outsider to the bank.
An insider is someone who has an employment history with the bank prior to being
appointed as its CEO, whereas this is not the case for an outsider. Such a difference in
professional origin should affect the incoming CEO's propensity for taking an earnings
bath for two reasons. First, before being appointed as CEO an inside successor has
frequently headed departments that are critical to the bank's overall performance (e. g. the
loan division or corporate clients). Therefore, questionable managerial decision-making
and dissatisfactory performance in the past may, in part, also be attributable to his or
her involvement and skills. Second, he or she has been collaborating with the incumbent
CEO in his or her former position, which may give rise to some sort of social ties between
both individuals. Given the importance of social networks for being promoted within a
firm (Vancil (1987)), those ties are likely to influence the successor's behavior with respect
to big bath accounting. As a result, an insider may neither be inclined nor able to blame
the predecessor for poor past performance and inappropriate decision-making as much as
an outsider. Consequently, an inside successor is unable to raise discretionary expenses
for the purpose of taking an earnings bath as much as an outsider. While we expect the
amount of discretionary expenses to be larger during either of the two turnover types
compared to non-turnover years, we predict with respect to their relative importance to
one another:
5
Hypothesis 2: An incoming CEO incurs more additional discretionary expenses du-
ring the turnover year if he or she is an outsider rather than an insider.
Beyond differences in the successor's professional origin, different triggers of the turn-
over event are also likely to influence the incoming CEO's propensity to engage in big
bath accounting. The probably most intuitive cause for a turnover is the retirement of the
incumbent CEO. Other potential triggers include a voluntary or involuntary resignation,
the non-prolongation of an expiring contract (either at the request of the bank or the
executive) or CEO dismissal.
The literature (e. g. Pourciau (1993), Wells (2002)) investigates differences in the way
managerial discretion is exerted during so-called routine CEO changes on the one hand and
non-routine ones on the other. Whereas a routine turnover is characterized by a relatively
orderly CEO succession process, a bank may not have the opportunity to adequately
structure a non-routine turnover. A typical example of a (non-) routine turnover is CEO
retirement (dismissal). Both above-mentioned authors acknowledge the lack of consistent
criteria for classifying turnovers into either routine or non-routine events and the large
potential for misclassifications. As we are also unaware of convincing criteria, we refrain
from replicating their ideas. Since our data allow us to reliably separate turnovers owing
to retirement of the former CEO from those triggered by any other reason, we instead
investigate differences between those two types of turnovers. Retirements are by far the
most frequent cause of routine turnovers in the above-mentioned studies. Therefore, it
is not surprising that our following line of argument closely resembles the reasoning on
routine turnovers.
As a retirement turnover is a rather well-planned event, and given that the existing
empirical evidence suggests that incumbent CEO exercises considerable influence over the
appointment process (Shivdasani and Yermack (1999)), he or she is likely to be involved
in selecting his or her successor. If so, both individuals may have established some connec-
tions, which are similar to ties developed between the incumbent and an inside successor.
As an even more relevant characteristic, owners and other stakeholders frequently eval-
uate the managerial performance of the departing CEO in a much less hostile manner
during retirement turnovers than during non-retirement ones. This particularly holds for
CEO resignations or dismissals. Consequently, a non-retirement turnover allows the in-
6
coming CEO to more pervasively blame the predecessor for poor current and past bank
performance and lets him or her take an earnings bath more easily.2 While we expect the
incoming CEO to engage in big bath accounting in either of the two turnover types, we
hypothesize with respect to their relative importance to one another:
Hypothesis 3: An incoming CEO incurs lower additional discretionary expenses
during the turnover year if the incumbent retires rather than leaves for other reasons.
2 We note that during non-retirement turnovers that are not due to resignation or dismissal, the
incoming CEO's abilities to engage in big bath accounting may be similarly limited than during
retirement changes.

3 Data and econometric model
3.1 Sample
Our data come from the Deutsche Bundesbank's prudential database BAKIS. This is the
information system on bank-specific data, which is jointly operated by the Deutsche Bun-
desbank and the German Financial Supervisory Authority (Memmel and Stein (2008)).
This unique database contains information on the financial statements of and supervisory
reports on individual German banks as well as information on bank executives' positions
and contract periods.
In building our sample, we started with banks that belong to the German universal
banking system, which consists of three sectors (commercial, cooperative, and savings
banks). However, we restrict our analyses to savings banks for the following reasons.
Many cooperative banks do not single out a member of the management team as being
the chief executive, and small commercial banks differ considerably from other banks in
the way they structure turnovers, since they are manager- or family-owned. We refrain
from mixing observations of savings banks with the of cooperative banks (which single
out a member of the management team as the chief executive) and larger commercial
banks, because of pronounced differences in governance and business models between the
three sectors (Memmel and Schertler (2012)). We also do not include money-center banks,
Landesbanken and cooperative central banks in our sample since they differ too much in
size, business model and governance to be jointly examined with savings banks.
Most German savings banks belong to state or local communities and profess to follow
social and/or regional development objectives. Owing to this ownership structure and,
according to practitioners as well as to rather vague renumeration reports, relatively little,
if any, performance pay, CEOs of savings banks may have lower incentives to engage
in big bath accounting than CEOs of other banks. Thus, finding earnings baths here
indicates that big bath accounting is likely even more important in the banking sector
as a whole. We analyze unconsolidated accounts prepared according to the German
Commercial Code ("HGB"), because the vast majority of German savings banks do not
prepare consolidated accounts at all. As a consequence, the unconsolidated statements
8
are nearly the only source of information available to most stakeholders for evaluating
managerial performance.
Our sample stretches over the years 1993 through 2012. We control for a substantial
number of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) during our sample period by creating a new
bank independent of the pre-M&A ones, which starts operating in the M&A year. Since
managerial behavior during M&A turnovers is presumably driven by different incentives
than those studied here, we exclude M&A turnovers from the sample. Technically speak-
ing, we neglect the first observation of the post-M&A bank and the last observation of
each pre-M&A bank. We require three consecutive observations for reliably identifying a
turnover. This, as well as missing data and eliminating gaps in banks' time series further
shrinks our estimation sample to a still reasonable, final number of 7,102 observations
from 692 savings banks.
3.2 Discretionary expenses
The existing literature has frequently proven that banks use different kinds of discretio-
nary expense items, such as loan loss accruals (e. g. Lobo and Yang (2001), Hasan and
Wall (2004)) and SGL (e. g. Beatty et al. (1995), Collins et al. (1995), Shrieves and Dahl
(2003)), for earnings management and income smoothing purposes. We follow this lite-
rature in considering LLP, loan charge-offs (LCO) and SGL as key components of banks'
discretionary expenses. In addition to these items, German financial accounting regula-
tion contains two almost unique positions, which are specified in sections 340f and 340g
HGB. These positions provide managers with considerable scope for exerting discretion
on the income streams of their banks (e. g. Bornemann et al. (2012)).
Section 340f HGB allows managers of German banks to build provisions for general
banking risks (hereinafter 340f reserves). The bank's management alone is responsible for
decision-making on 340f reserves and owners lack any influence on this decision. These
reserves are built by deliberately understating the book value of customer and interbank
loans as well as bonds, other fixed-income securities, shares and securities bearing variable
interest that are assigned to the liquidity reserve (as an asset category for securities in the
banking book that are available for sale) by up to 4%. The fact that their level does not
need not be linked to the risks inherent in the underlying assets strongly encourages ma-
9
nagerial discretion. Moreover, expenses (income) from building (releasing) 340f reserves
may be compensated with income (expenses) from the lending business. Therefore, their
levels and changes therein are invisible in the balance sheets and income statements of
German banks. They are merely reported to auditors and supervisors. Thus, 340f reserves
are hidden to most of the banks' stakeholders.
On top of this, bank managers are, according to section 340g HGB, given the op-
portunity to provision for general banking risks by building visible reserves (hereinafter
340g reserves). As with their hidden counterpart, decision-making with respect to these
reserves lies solely with the bank's management. Owner approval is not needed. In con-
trast to 340f reserves, the level of 340g reserves has to be disclosed as a separate balance
sheet item and changes therein are captured by a corresponding position in banks' income
statements. Much like 340f reserves, the main scope for exercising managerial discretion
arises from the missing link between the level of 340g reserves and the risks inherent
in any specific assets. Unlike 340f reserves, this level is moreover not restricted by any
quantitative limit.
Thus, investigating managerial discretion during periods of CEO turnovers at Ger-
man banks requires consideration to be given to the decision-making on LLP, LCO, SGL,
changes in 340f reserves and changes in 340g reserves. Table 1 provides descriptive statis-
tics for each of these variables measured for bank i in year t as a percentage of the bank's
end-of-year t - 1 total assets. On average, LCO account for 0.30% of total assets, fol-
lowed by LLP at 0.29% and SGL at 0.19%. Changes in 340f reserves and changes in 340g
reserves are similar in size at 0.09% and 0.11%, respectively, of total assets.
Additionally, the table delivers descriptive statistics for DISCTA. This is the aggregate
of all discretionary expenses measured for bank i in year t. More specifically, net expenses,
i. e. expenses from building, less income from releasing annual general and specific LLP
as well as annual LCO, are added to net expenses from building 340g and 340f reserves.
From this sum, net SGL (i. e. gains less losses) are deducted. A positive (negative) value
of DISCTA indicates that bank i in year t incurs discretionary expenses (gains), which
reduce (increase) net income as presented in the P&L. On average, DISCTA accounts
for 0.34% of total assets. The average size of discretionary expenses is remarkable, since
discretionary expenses account for as much as 42%, on average, of non-discretionary

LLP (loan loss provisions), LCO (P&L relevant loan charge-offs and use of LLP), SGL (security gains and losses), CH340f

of its end-of-year t - 1 total assets. DISCTA

is the aggregate of discretionary expenses. It follows from expenses from
building, less income from releasing annual general and specific LLP and annual LCO plus net expenses from building
340g and 340f reserves minus net SGL.
income. The information on various percentiles shows that most annual discretionary
expenses in our sample are positive. This indicates that managerial discretion is more
often used to decrease rather than increase net income, i.e. the number of years in which
banks build discretionary expenses is higher than the number of years in which they realize
discretionary gains.
We use DISCTA rather than the individual items it is comprised of as the dependent
variable in our analyses. In this regard, our study differs from existing studies on income
smoothing (e. g. Beatty et al. (1995), Collins et al. (1995), Shrieves and Dahl (2003)) that
capture discretion inherent in more than one item by means of a system of simultaneous
equations. We do not follow such an approach, because we want to measure the total effect
of turnovers on discretionary expenses. Measuring total effects in a system of simultaneous
equations is not possible in our case, since banks have too much leeway as their decisions on
changes in 340f reserves, 340g reserves and LLP are likely perfect substitutes. Technically
speaking, it is difficult to find identifying variables for the additional country-specific
expenses (i. e. those from building 340f and 340g reserves) that we would have to consider
in our analyses. A beneficial side-effect of using DISCTA as the dependent variable is
that an econometric model considering potential dynamic responses is much more easily
implemented for DISCTA than for the individual items it is comprised of because DISCTA

3.3 Turnovers and discretionary expenses
In Table 2, we give information on the total number of turnovers as well as the numbers of
insider and outsider turnovers on the one hand, and of retirement and non-retirement ones
on the other. Overall, our sample consists of 518 turnovers. 389 are insider turnovers; only
129 are outsider turnovers. Most turnovers are due to retirement, which is in line with the
related literature (Pourciau (1993), Wells (2002)). One may argue that outside successors
are more likely chosen during non-retirement turnovers, while retiring CEOs may to be
more frequently by insiders. As shown, 38.4% of all non-retirement turnovers and only
19.6% of all retirement ones are followed by outside succession. Thus, insider/outsider
turnovers and retirement/non-retirement turnovers are not independent of one another.

Note: The table relates insider and outsider to retirement and non-retirement turnovers over the sample period 1995-2012.
Column refers to the observations in each cell of the table as a percentage of the number of observations in the respective
column. Row reveals the observations in each cell of the table as a percentage of the total number of observations in the
respective row.
Next, we report the means of discretionary expenses (DISCTA) for banks in the pre-
turnover (t-1), the turnover (t) and the post-turnover (t+1) year in Panel A of Table 3.
The means of DISCTA are given separately for all turnover observations regardless of
the specific turnover type, for those involving an insider or an outsider turnover, and
finally for those subject to a retirement or a non-retirement. Noteworthy is the following
12
cross-sectional variation in the data: Banks with outsider turnovers have lower average
discretionary expenses in the pre-turnover, the turnover and the post-turnover year than
banks with insider turnovers, while the average discretionary expenses of retirement turn-
overs do not differ much from those relating to non-retirement turnovers. The persistent
difference in discretionary expenses is likely to indicate that banks with outsider turnover
differ significantly in their risk profile and exposure from banks with insider turnover.
In order to gain preliminary insights into our hypotheses that deal with additional
discretionary expenses we have to look, however, at time-series variations in discretio-
nary expenses. Therefore, we provide information on how discretionary expenses in the
turnover year differ from the ones before and after the turnover event, and test whether
the differences differ from zero. As indicated by the significant and positive difference
between discretionary expenses in t and t - 1 in Panel A (0.032*), banks experiencing a
turnover exhibit larger discretionary expenses during the turnover year than in the pre-
turnover year. This provides preliminary support for hypothesis 1. A similar positive and
significant difference is observable for insider as well as retirement turnovers, while for
outsiders and non-retirement turnovers the differences lack statistical significance. Thus,
we do not find that outsider turnovers experience larger amounts of discretionary expenses
than insider turnovers (as argued by hypothesis 2), nor do we find that non-retirement
turnovers exhibit larger amounts of discretionary expenses than retirement turnovers as
postulated by hypothesis 3.
Large amounts of discretionary expenses in turnover years may be initiated by risk
provisioning rather than big bath accounting considerations. More specifically, part of
our measure of discretionary expenses in turnover years may be solely attributable to the
incoming CEO trying to rectify shortages in risk provisioning. Thus, interpreting extraor-
dinary amounts of discretionary expenses during turnover years as big bath accounting,
means ensuring that the effect is not driven by risk provisioning considerations.
Therefore, we divide the sample into two subsamples and investigate them separately.
The division is based on a bank's aggregate stock of risk provisions, which is the loan loss
allowance plus the stock of 340f and 340g reserves, as a percentage of its non-performing
loans. Observations with a value of this ratio above (below) the median of all observations
are assigned to the subsample banks with high risk provisions (banks with low risk provi-

Note: All refers to observations with a turnover event irrespective of the turnover type. Insider (outsider) denotes
observations with an insider (outsider) turnover. Retirement (non-retirement) refers to observations with a retirement
(non-retirement) turnover. In Panel A all banks with a turnover event in the sample period are considered. In Panel B
(Panel C) only banks with a turnover event and an above-median (below-median) stock of risk provisions are considered.

sions). High values in this variable render it less likely that the incoming CEO merely
incurs large amounts of discretionary expenses in response to insufficient past provisio-
ning. Thus, observing extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses during turnover
years in this subsample as well may provide further tentative evidence suggesting the
existence of big bath accounting.
14
We report the results for banks with high and low risk provisions in Panel B and
C of Table 3. For the subsample of banks with low risk provisions, we find none of
the differences of discretionary expenses in the turnover and pre-turnover years to be
significant. For banks with high risk provisions, however, we find pronounced effects.
Discretionary expenses in the turnover year t are significantly higher than the ones in t-1,
which indicates that incoming CEOs incur significantly larger amounts of discretionary
expenses during the turnover year. Their rather high stock of risk provisions at the end
of year t-1 renders the increase unlikely to be driven by risk provisioning considerations.
This is even more true considering that the amount of discretionary expenses significantly
decreases again during the post-turnover year t + 1. The objective of taking an earnings
bath would, however, perfectly explain the observable pattern in discretionary expenses.
For banks with high risk provisions, we also find differences between insider and
outsider turnovers as hypothesized in hypothesis 2 and between retirement and non-
retirement turnovers as hypothesized in hypothesis 3. For insider turnovers, discretionary
expenses increase by less than 0.06 between t - 1 and t . For outsider turnovers, the
respective increase is almost 0.11. These numbers suggest that differences in additional
discretionary expenses are higher for outsider turnovers than for insider turnovers. More-
over, we find that the amount of discretionary expenses almost returns to its pre-turnover
year level in the year immediately following the turnover event for both outsider and
insider turnovers. For retirement turnovers, discretionary expenses increase by less than
0.06 between t-1 and t, while for non-retirement turnovers they increase by almost 0.11.
It is noteworthy that, for non-retirement turnovers, discretionary expenses decrease by
0.093 between t and t+1, which almost neutralizes the increase in discretionary expenses
between t-1 and t. Overall, these findings are indicative of the incoming CEO taking an
earnings bath in his or her first partial year in charge by raising discretionary expenses
in the short term only.
3.4 Econometric model and controls
The differences in discretionary expenses between the turnover year and pre-turnover
year may be a first indication of big bath accounting taking place during turnover events.
However, in the previous analyses we did not control for the economic circumstances
15
of banks experiencing a turnover event. Therefore, we put forward in the following an
econometric model to measure big bath accounting more precisely. The dependent variable
in this model is the aggregate discretionary expenses of bank i in year t, DISCTA. To
examine the effect of executive changes on discretionary expenses during turnover years,
we use D TURN , which is a binary variable equaling 1 if a CEO turnover occurs at bank
i in year t, and 0 otherwise. Equation (1) shows our baseline model, from which we derive
all subsequent specifications:

Next, we introduce our control variables, which contain measures of the bank's non-
discretionary income, its credit risk and its risk provisioning. We provide descriptive
statistics of our control variables in Table 4, and display correlation coefficients in Table 5.
We winsorize each continuous variable at the 1% and 99% percentile.

Note: Mean (Std. Dev.) describes the mean (standard deviation) of each variable across all observations. p1 (p50 and
p99, respectively) refers to the 1st (50th and 99th) percentile of the distribution of the corresponding variable. POSNDI TA
i,t
(NEGNDI TA
i,t
) equals non-discretionary income (net income less aggregate discretionary expenses) if positive (negative) of
bank i in year t as a percentage of its end-of-year total assets (TA) in t - 1. CHOLTA
i,t
is the change in the volume of the
overall loan portfolio from year t - 1 to t as a percentage of TA at t - 1. NPLTA
i,t
is the volume of non-performing loans as
a percentage of TA. CHNPLTA
i,t
is the change in the volume of non-performing loans from year t - 1 to t as a percentage
of TA at t - 1. RPROV TA

denotes the aggregate stock of risk provisions (i. e. the loan loss allowance plus the level of
340f and 340g reserves) as a percentage of TA. LIM BASIS

is the level of 340f reserves as a percentage of TA. LNTAi,t is

The literature has identified that banks smooth their income by revealing a positive
relationship between non-discretionary income and (various types of) discretionary ex-
penses (e. g. Lobo and Yang (2001), Hasan and Wall (2004), Beatty et al. (1995), Collins
et al. (1995), Shrieves and Dahl (2003), Bornemann et al. (2012)). Given highly posi-
tive non-discretionary income, managers incur high amounts of discretionary expenses.
When non-discretionary income is low or even negative, managers incur low amounts of
discretionary expenses or even realize discretionary gains. By doing so, they smooth their
banks' income streams over time. Since the adjustment to positive non-discretionary in-
come might differ from the one to negative non-discretionary income, we include positive
(POSNDI TA) and negative (NEGNDI TA) non-discretionary income separately to capture
banks' income smoothing behavior. The former (latter) equals bank i's non-discretionary
income as long as this is positive (negative), and 0 otherwise.
We use three variables to control for credit risk that may trigger a rise in discretionary
expenses, particularly in LLP and LCO. CHOLTA is the annual change in the ratio of
overall (i. e. customer and interbank) loans to total assets in year t - 1. It captures
changes in credit risk arising from an expansion of the loan portfolio. NPLTA, which
is the level of non-performing loans, and CHNPLTA, being the annual change in non-
performing loans,3 reflect changes in credit risk arising from changes in the quality of
the loan portfolio. Positive values in CHOLTA and CHNPLTA are likely to trigger larger
amounts of discretionary expenses, while the association between NPLTA and DISCTA is
rather unclear.
To control for risk provisioning efforts, we use RPROV TA, which is the aggregate stock
of risk provisions (i. e. the loan loss allowance plus the level of 340f and 340g reserves)
relative to total assets. High values of this variable render it less likely that large discretio-
nary expenses are merely observable as a reaction to insufficient past provisioning. Thus,
the association between RPROV TA and DISCTA should be negative. Further we control
for LIM BASIS , which is the level of 340f reserves as a percentage of the aggregate book
value of the underlying assets. This variable controls for the possibility that managers of
some banks may be restricted in exerting discretion. If a bank approaches the 4% limit
3 Following the Capital Requirements Directive (European Parliament (2006)), loans are non-
performing if the payment of principal or interest is overdue by at least 90 days.
17
on 340f reserves, it is unable to increase them any further. Therefore, we expect a nega-
tive correlation between this variable and discretionary expenses. Note, that the strong
positive correlation between LIM BASIS and RPROV TA (see Table 5) does not affect the
conclusions we draw from our empirical analyses.
We control for size effects by using the natural logarithm of total assets (LNTA) as
it is frequently done in earnings management studies. However, we do not have any
expectation as to the sign of the prevailing coefficient. We also include the first lag of
our dependent variable as regressor since the recent literature reveals gradual adjustments
over time with respect to LLP (e. g. Laeven and Majnoni (2003), Bikker and Metzemakers
(2005), P´
erez et al. (2008)) and 340f reserves (Bornemann et al. (2012)). Additionally,
we include year dummy variables to capture time-specific effects.
To test how CEO turnovers impact on the banks' discretionary expenses reflected in the
time variation of the data rather than in its cross-sectional one, we model a bank-specific
effect µi
and let i,t
denote a disturbance term. It is noteworthy that the bank-specific
effect µi
controls as effectively as possible for all bank characteristics that do not change
over our sample period. For instance, we do not control for the size of the board, because
there is little to no variation in the size over our sample period. Also, this bank-specific
effect µi
captures other governance structures, such as whether or not the bank has a risk
committee in place, as long as these governance structures do not vary over our sample
period.
We use the dynamic panel data estimator, which is a generalized method of moments
estimator, proposed by Blundell and Bond (1998) with a finite sample correction following
Windmeijer (2005) in all models. The estimation results will be consistent if we use ap-
propriate instruments for the lag of the dependent variable and if there is no second-order
autocorrelation present in the data. Therefore, we use the Hansen test of overidentifying
restrictions (Arellano and Bond (1991), Blundell and Bond (1998)). Since this test can
be weakened by many instruments (Roodman (2009)), we specify only a limited number
of instruments. We use the same lag structure of instruments in all estimations through-
out the paper. The tests for overidentifying restrictions and second-order autocorrelation
indicate the instruments used to be valid and second-order autocorrelation to be absent.
18
We modify our baseline model given in Equation (1) along two lines. Based on a
bank's aggregate stock of risk provisions as a percentage of its non-performing loans, we
first estimate the baseline model for the full sample and the subsamples of banks with high
and low risk provisions. Second, to isolate differences between insider and outsider as well
as between retirement and non-retirement turnovers, we split the turnover dummy variable
into different subgroups. D TURN INS (D TURN OUT ) equals 1 if an insider (outsider)
turnover occurs. D TURN RET (D TURN NORET ) equals 1 if a turnover is (not) due to a
retiring incumbent. We do so in order to gain insights into hypotheses 2 and 3.

4 Results
4.1 CEO turnover effects
In Table 6, we present the results of our baseline model, estimated for the full sample
(marked as All) as well as for subsamples of banks with high and low stock risk provisions
separately. For the full sample, the positive and significant coefficient on D TURN reveals
that incoming CEOs incur significantly higher amounts of discretionary expenses during
turnover years, which lends support to hypothesis 1. For banks with high risk provisions
relative to their non-performing loans, the corresponding coefficient is also significant
and of similar size. The fact that incoming CEOs in banks with an above-median stock
of risk provisions incur extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses strengthens our
conjecture of big bath accounting being at work. For banks with low risk provisions, the
corresponding coefficient is significant and somewhat higher than for the subsample of
banks with high risk provisions. This may either reveal efforts to take an earnings bath as
well, or it may reflect the incoming CEO's need to rectify shortages in the existing stock
of risk provisions or both.
The positive and strongly significant coefficients on POSNDI TA and NEGNDI TA are
consistent with income smoothing behavior of banks absent any turnover events (e. g.
Lobo and Yang (2001), Hasan and Wall (2004)), Beatty et al. (1995), Collins et al.
(1995), Shrieves and Dahl (2003), Bornemann et al. (2012)). An additional unit of posi-
tive non-discretionary income leads to an additional 0.72 units of discretionary expenses.
Likewise, an additional unit of negative non-discretionary income leads to a reduction of
1.27 units of discretionary expenses.4 Thus, less discretionary expenses are incurred or
even discretionary gains are realized in times of negative non-discretionary income. The
difference in the coefficients on POSNDI TA and NEGNDI TA indicates that additional
positive non-discretionary income is (only) partially set aside by means of discretionary
expenses whereas additional negative non-discretionary income is overcompensated by re-
4 With respect to the interpretation of the coefficient on NEGNDI TA, it is important to note two
particularities. First, all values of this variable are either 0 or negative. Second, we talk of an
additional unit of negative non-discretionary income when referring to a change from e. g. -1 to -2
units. As a consequence, a positive coefficient on this variable indicates less discretionary expenses
being incurred.

ductions in discretionary expenses. This asymmetric effect resembles an observation also
made by Balboa and Rubia (2013).
The effects of the variables measuring credit risk are broadly consistent with the fin-
dings in the literature. An increase in the volume of the loan portfolio, CHOLTA, is asso-
ciated with lower discretionary expenses for banks with low as well as high risk provisions.
As these partly consist of annual LLP, this is surprising at first sight. Previous studies on
22
loan loss provisioning (e. g. Laeven and Majnoni (2003), Gebhardt and Novotny-Farkas
(2011)) conjecture their similar finding to indicate procyclical provisioning behavior. As
our aggregate of discretionary expenses comprises several additional components, this re-
sult could also have other reasons. For example, some banks may substitute assets in their
loan portfolio with securities. If those subsequently lose value (which would be reflected
in a negative value of SGLTA), this would yield such a negative association. The positive
and significant coefficients on CHNPLTA for banks with low as well as high risk provi-
sions show that a rise in the volume of non-performing loans is accompanied by larger
discretionary expenses.
A high level of risk provision in the previous year (RPROV TA) is associated with
less discretionary expenses only if banks have a below-median value of risk provisions
relative to their non-performing loans, while LIM BASIS , which also impacts negatively
on discretionary expenses, is likewise significant for banks with low as well as high risk
provisions. The significantly positive coefficient on LNTA aligns with findings on LLP
(e. g. Alali and Jaggi (2011)). However, in our sample, significant size effects are only
present for banks with low risk provisions and not for banks with high risk provisions.
Finally, the significant and positive coefficient on the lagged dependent variable reveals
a gradual adjustment of discretionary expenses to occur. We note that the effects of our
control variables do not change much across our various model specifications presented in
the following, which allow us to refrain from commenting on these again.
4.2 Effects of different turnover characteristics
We now turn to investigating differences in the incoming CEO's propensity for taking
an earnings bath between insider and outsider as well as between retirement and non-
retirement turnovers. Following our considerations in Section 2, an inside successor as
well as one succeeding a retiring CEO should have lower incentives as well as limited
abilities to engage in big bath accounting during the turnover year than outside successors
or those following a non-retiring CEO. Table 7 presents the results of our examination
along these two lines of arguments, each of the models being estimated for the full sample
as well as for the subsamples of banks with high and low stocks of risk provisions.
23
In Model A, we replace the turnover dummy variable D TURN in Equation (1) with
one indicating an insider (D TURN INS ) and another indicating an outsider turnover
(D TURN OUT ). For the full sample, both corresponding coefficients are positive and
significant, with the one on outsider turnovers exceeding its inside counterpart by far.
According to a Wald test, the difference in the size of the coefficients is significant at the
5% level. Thus, we find the amount of discretionary expenses incurred during turnover
years to be higher than during non-turnover years, with the magnitude of this difference
being larger for outsider than for insider turnovers. Apparently, the outside successors'
propensity for incurring discretionary expenses during turnover years is higher than that
of insiders appointed as CEO. This strongly supports hypothesis 2.
For the subsample of banks with high risk provisions, the amount of discretionary ex-
penses incurred during turnover years is significantly different to that during non-turnover
years, though only for outsider turnovers. Insider successors at banks with relatively high
risk provisions apparently do not engage in big bath accounting. Their ability to blame
their predecessors for poor decision-making in the past, which is already limited as a
result of their former position within the bank, is narrowed further by an existing high
stock of risk provisions. The results for the subsample of banks with low risk provisions
resemble those of the full sample. Incoming CEOs in insider and outsider turnovers incur
significantly larger amounts of discretionary expenses. However, this difference is insig-
nificant for banks with low risk provisions, while it is significant for banks with high risk
provisions.
In Model B, we replace the general turnover dummy D TURN with one indicating a
retirement (D TURN RET ) and another one denoting a non-retirement (D TURN NORET )
turnover. In the full sample, both coefficients are, as expected, positive and significant.
However, the two coefficients do not differ from each other significantly. For the subsample
of banks with high risk provisions, we find that managers of those banks to incur signi-
ficantly larger discretionary expenses during non-retirement turnovers, but not during
retirement ones. The results for banks with low risk provisions indicate that successors of
CEOs leaving office but not retiring incur larger amounts of discretionary expenses during
turnover years. In a nutshell, the results for retirement versus non-retirement turnovers
24
do correspond to our expectations as expressed in hypothesis 3 but only for banks with
high risk provisions.
In Model C, we investigate the influence of insider and outsider as well as retirement
and non-retirement turnovers at a time. To do so, we include all four possible combinations
between D TURN INS and D TURN OUT on the one hand as well as D TURN RET and
D TURN NORET on the other. Using the arguments from Section 2, we expect the most
pronounced earnings bath effect for outsider non-retirement turnovers since these two
characteristics of a turnover provide the incoming CEO with the strongest incentives and
the best case for taking an earnings bath. We expect the weakest earnings bath effect for
insider retirement turnovers; the effects of the other two turnover type combinations are
expect between these two extremes.

For the full sample, all corresponding coefficients are positive but only outsider re-
tirement and outsider non-retirement turnovers are statistically significant. The largest
amount of income-decreasing discretionary expenses is incurred during non-retirement
turnovers in which the successor is recruited from outside the bank, followed by retirement
turnovers with outsider succession. Both may indicate the huge potential for outsiders
to take an earnings bath. Considering banks with high risk provisions, the coefficient
on outsider non-retirement turnovers is still the largest one and the only one that differs
significantly from zero. Retirement turnovers with outsider succession are not, as in the
full sample, characterized by larger amounts of discretionary expenses. For banks with
low risk provisions, only the coefficient on the outsider retirement turnovers is statistically
significant, while all other types lack statistical significance.
4.3 Model extension and robustness
To corroborate our results presented so far, we put forward one extension and several ro-
bustness checks. Our extension deals with the timing of the turnover event. We conjecture
that the incoming CEO's incentives for exerting discretion should be affected differently,
depending on whether the turnover occurs during the corresponding year or at its end.
In the case of a mid-year turnover, the successor heads the bank during the final months
of the turnover year. This is the time when most decisions on discretionary expenses are
made. By contrast, for year-end turnovers the incoming CEO is not yet in charge of the
bank's operations during these months. Even though he or she may still influence the
preparation of the financial statements during his or her first months in charge (i. e. at
the beginning of the subsequent year), the incoming CEO's potential for revising decisions
made by his or her incumbent are certainly limited in the case of year-end turnovers. This
particularly holds looking at SGL as one part of our discretionary expenses measure. A
CEO joining the bank right at the start of the post-turnover year is unable to attribute
discretionary losses to the turnover year by selling securities (and thus incurring SGL).
That CEO is instead restricted to incurring discretionary expenses from LLP, LCO and
changes in 340f and 340g reserves only.
We note that in a year-end turnover, the successor may, for this reason, try to use
the post-turnover year for incurring extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses.
28
Incentives for doing so may be limited for the following reason. As the incoming CEO
will be heading the bank throughout the full year, the assessment of his or her managerial
ability is ­ in contrast to mid-year turnovers ­ likely to be based on the bank's performance
during the corresponding accounting period.

To examine differences in big bath accounting between mid-year and year-end turn-
overs, we split the turnover dummy into D TURN MID (indicating a mid-year turnover)
and D TURN END (referring to a year-end CEO change). We also check whether incoming
CEOs ­ particularly during year-end turnovers ­ use the post-turnover year rather than
the turnover year for taking an earnings bath. To do so, we include the one year-lagged
mid-year and year-end turnover indicators in our models. 360 of the total of 518 turnover
events occur during the year, and 158 at year-end. While mid-year and year-end turnovers
do not differ significantly with respect to the percentage of incoming CEOs from outside
the bank, they do differ to the extent that the incumbent CEO retires in 74% of mid-year
turnovers and in only 63% of year-end turnovers.
In Table 8, we present the results for the full sample as well as the subsamples of banks
with high and low risk provisions. Mid-year turnover observations exhibit significantly
larger amounts of discretionary expenses in the full sample and in both subsamples than
non-turnover observations. The insignificant coefficients on the one year-lagged mid-year
and year-end turnover indicators for banks with high risk provisions are worth noting,
because CEOs who are appointed not before year-end apparently use neither the turnover
nor the post-turnover year for taking an earnings bath. As big bath accounting apparently
takes place during mid-year turnovers only, bank owners are able to limit the extent to
which the incoming CEO is able to exert discretion by scheduling the executive changes
around the end of the year, if possible. In this case, the leeway available to the incoming
CEO excludes the use of SGL and merely include using LLP, LCO and changes in 340f
and 340g reserves.
We perform four robustness checks, the results of which are not reported in detail here,
but are available upon request. The first one deals with the risk provisioning classification
of banks. Using the median value of the ratio of risk provisions to non-performing loans
to distinguish between banks with high and low risk provisioning may be misleading,
because an incoming CEO at a bank with above-median risk provisioning might still have
incentives to increase discretionary expenses for purely risk provisioning considerations.
We therefore checked whether we find big bath accounting effects for banks whose risk
provisioning is above the 66th percentile value of the risk provisioning distribution. We
find our previously discussed results confirmed: a CEO appointed at a bank with very
30
high risk provisioning relative to non-performing loans, especially when he or she comes
from outside the bank, shows extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses in his or
her first year of stewardship.
Next, we check whether our findings are confirmed for large and small banks. We split
the sample according to the median value of total assets and find that both large and
small banks show effects that are in line with taking an earnings bath. Irrespective of
whether or not a CEO is appointed at a small or large bank, he or she shows extraordinary
amounts of discretionary expenses in his or her first year of stewardship.
Our third robustness check refers to findings in the literature that a company's perfor-
mance is strongly associated with the likelihood of a change in the top executive's position
(e. g. Denis and Denis (1995), Schaeck et al. (2012)). Moreover, an inverse relationship
between this performance and the likelihood of outside succession has been revealed (e. g.
Parrino (1997)). Thus, the turnover dummy in our baseline model might be endogenous.
To check whether this endogeneity drives our results, we re-estimate our models and in-
clude the age of the CEO as an additional instrument, which is likely to be exogenous.
The results of the baseline model do not change much and we merely note that the p-
values of the Hansen test increase, especially for banks with high risk provisions. Hence,
using this additional instrument increases the validity of our instruments.
As a fourth robustness check, we exclude banks that do not experience a single turnover
event through the whole study period from our sample. This is meant to test whether
cross-sectional differences between these banks and those having at least one CEO change
drive our findings. We moreover restrict the number of observations for each bank in the
sample to five, ranging from two years prior to two years following the turnover year. We
do so in order to focus on the development of discretionary expenses in turnover years
as well as in those shortly before and after these events. Since the maximum number
of observations for each bank is five, we exclude the lagged dependent variable from the
models, use traditional fixed effect estimations and re-estimate all our models. As we
observe no changes in the signs of the coefficients, and only moderate changes in their
magnitudes, this robustness check also confirms our findings.

5 Conclusions
We investigated whether incoming CEOs in banks incur extraordinary amounts of discre-
tionary expenses during their first partial year in charge. Taking an earnings bath saves
income for future periods and it reduces net income in the turnover year, and thus lowers
the earnings benchmark to be achieved during subsequent years. As such, big bath accoun-
ting is meant to mitigate top executives' job security concerns. However, extraordinary
amounts of discretionary expenses are not necessarily indicative of big bath accounting,
because an incoming CEO may merely incur discretionary expenses in order to rectify
shortages in the bank's risk provisioning rather than to engage in big bath accounting
strategies. We dealt with this by differentiating between banks with an above- and a
below-median stock of existing risk provisions relative to their risk exposures. The former
are unlikely to have any need to rectify insufficient past provisioning. In turn, this makes
big bath accounting considerations more likely to represent a conclusive explanation for
observing extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses.
Our research took the following routes. First, we examined whether incoming CEOs
take an earnings bath during turnover events regardless of their specific circumstances. We
indeed found that successors incur extraordinary amounts of discretionary expenses even
at banks with an above-median stock of existing risk provisions. Second, we investigated
whether insiders (who share an employment history with the bank) have lower incentives
for reducing a bank's net income during turnover years than outsiders, because insiders
have limited abilities to exclusively blame their predecessors for poor past decision-making.
With the amount of discretionary expenses incurred during turnover years being larger
for outsider than for insider turnovers, we found that our conjecture held true. Third, we
tested whether the extent of big bath accounting is less pronounced in turnovers in which
the incumbent CEO retires than in cases in which he or she leaves for other reasons. A
predecessor leaving for other reasons (e. g. contract expiration, resignation or dismissal)
may be more easily blamed for poor past performance than a retiring CEO. We found
this conjecture to hold true for banks with high risk provisions. Finally, we provided
results on an interesting extension. This extension indicates that bank owners may be
able to successfully limit the incoming CEO's propensity for taking an earnings bath by

scheduling the executive change around the end of a year rather than at mid-year. In
year-end turnovers, the incoming CEO lacks the ability to time transactions for incurring
discretionary expenses, and his or her scope for engaging in big bath accounting are
limited to using loan loss provisions and loan charge-offs as well as changes in 340f and
340g reserves, not allowing to use securities gains and losses as another instrument.
Our empirical investigation is subject to one potential weakness, which may equally
be interpreted as one of its strengths. As we acknowledge in Section 2, the literature
frequently argues that differences in big bath accounting are more pronounced between
routine and non-routine turnovers rather than between retirement and non-retirement
ones. However, in contrast to the vague criteria used to separate routine and non-routine
turnover events in previous studies, our separation between retirement and non-retirement
turnovers is rather objective and reliable. Therefore, we decided to stick to the investi-
gation of differences between these two types of turnovers rather than replicating ideas
already presented in the literature. It would certainly be insightful to be able to further
differentiate between different types of non-retirement turnovers, such as CEO resigna-
tions or dismissals on the one hand and CEOs leaving to join the management of larger
or more well-known banks on the other.
