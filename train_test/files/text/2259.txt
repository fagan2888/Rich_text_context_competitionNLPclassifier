Abstract
Background: Compared to whites, U.S. Hispanics have higher obesity rates; U.S. Asians have lower rates. However Hispanics
and Asians are each comprised of several ethnic subgroups that differ with respect to country of origin, immigration history,
and geographic distribution across the U.S. Among adolescents, ethnic differences in obesity have been previously
reported, but no studies have examined longitudinal change in body mass index (BMI) by Hispanic and Asian subgroup
category to understand when and why these disparities emerge, especially during the critical transition between
adolescence and adulthood.
Methods: Using nationally-representative, longitudinal data from 1355 Hispanics (Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban, Central/
South American, Other Hispanic), 520 Asians (Chinese, Filipino, Other Asian), and 5061whites from the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Waves II­IV: 1996­2009), we used linear mixed spline models to examine whether Hispanic and
Asian adolescent subgroups shared the same BMI trajectories as whites as they aged into adulthood. We also investigated
the role of social and behavioral factors in explaining race/ethnic differences.
Results: Among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals exhibited faster increases in BMI both in
adolescence and in adulthood and these patterns were not attributable to the measured social and behavioral factors. There
was also evidence of emerging disparities in Cuban males, and in Central/South Americans relative to whites. In contrast,
Chinese, Filipino, and Other Asian adolescents had significantly lower BMI and slower BMI increases in adulthood compared
to whites. In models adjusted for social and behavioral factors, Chinese-white and Other Asian-white differentials remained
unexplained.
Conclusions: Aggregate estimates of Hispanics and Asians mask important heterogeneity in BMI. A better understanding of
weight dynamics early in the life course can inform how and when disparities emerge to better target prevention efforts.

Introduction
Although obesity has impacted all segments of society, rates are
high in Hispanic and low in Asian as compared to white
adolescents and adults in the United States [1­3]. Disparities,
especially in Hispanics, also appear to be exacerbating over time.
For example, between 1986­1998, overweight prevalence in
Hispanic adolescents increased 120% compared to 50% for whites
[4].
Much of this literature examines Hispanics and Asians as single
pan-ethnic groups despite the fact that each are comprised of
several ethnicities that are heterogeneous with respect to country
of origin, genetic ancestry, immigration history, and geographic
distribution which likely contribute to variation in weight
patterning. While there has been increasing recognition of
Hispanic and Asian subgroup heterogeneity in health research
[5,6], data limitations have precluded their disaggregation.
Nevertheless disentangling these pan-ethnic categories is necessary
to better identify sub-populations at greatest risk.
Limited research on weight patterning by ethnic subgroup has
been cross-sectional. In adults, Mexicans and Puerto Ricans had
higher overweight/obesity than Cubans [7]; Japanese, Filipino,
and other Asian subgroups had higher overweight/obesity than
Chinese [8,9]. In U.S. adolescents, patterns are somewhat similar.

In one study, obesity was more common in Puerto Rican than in
Mexican and Cuban adolescents [10]; in another, Mexican,
Puerto Rican, and Cuban adolescents had similar obesity
prevalence which was higher than in Central/South Americans
[11]. In Asians, obesity was higher in Asians of other ancestral
background compared to Chinese and Filipino adolescents [11].
While there are clear ethnic subgroup disparities in obesity
among Hispanics and Asians in the U.S., no studies to our
knowledge have examined longitudinal changes in body mass
index (BMI) by ethnic subgroup to understand how and when
these disparities emerge, especially during the critical transition
between adolescence and adulthood. Using longitudinal data from
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), we examined whether Hispanic and Asian adolescent
subgroups shared the same BMI trajectory as white adolescents as
they aged into adulthood. This allowed us to evaluate whether
there are sensitive periods in the life-course for the emergence of
BMI disparities and if these sensitive periods differ across Hispanic
and Asian subgroups. Consistent with past cross-sectional findings,
we hypothesized that among Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto
Rican respondents would exhibit faster increases in BMI from
adolescence to adulthood relative to whites, and among Asians,
Chinese respondents would exhibit slower BMI increases. We also
investigated the contribution of social and behavioral risk factors
in explaining observed race/ethnic differences in adolescent BMI
and in BMI change over time. Hispanics and Asians are projected
to constitute an increasing share of the U.S. population [12,13].
Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of the health patterns
that emerge will be important for the design of more effective
interventions.
Materials and Methods
Ethics
Data for the Add Health cohort were collected under protocols
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Written parental/guardian
consent and adolescent assent were obtained before the Wave I
interview. At Wave IV, written consent was obtained from all
respondents.
Data
The Add Health cohort is a nationally representative school-
based study of adolescents (n = 20,745; age 11­20 years), in grades
7 to 12 in 1994­95 (wave I) who were followed into adulthood.
Information on how to obtain the Add Health data files is
available on the Add Health website (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/
addhealth). The study used a multistage, stratified, school-based,
clustered sampling design and included interviews with 85% of the
respondents' parents. Additional subsamples were also drawn to
provide meaningful data on individuals of Chinese, Cuban, and
Puerto Rican origin. Details regarding the survey design and
sampling frame have been previously described [14]. Of the
20,745 adolescents surveyed in wave I, 14,738 participants in
grades 7­11 were re-interviewed at wave II in 1996 (age: 12­
21 years). At wave III in 2001­02 (age: 18 to 27 years; n = 15,197)
and wave IV in 2008­09 (age: 24­33 years; n = 15,701), all wave I
respondents were eligible for follow-up regardless of wave II
participation. Non-response analysis indicates no significant bias to
Add Health estimates from attrition across waves [15].
The analysis sample included white, Hispanic, and Asian
respondents interviewed in wave II with longitudinal, post-
stratification sample weights (n = 7308). Exclusions included
respondents with missing measured height and weight at wave II
(height and weight were not measured at wave I), and pregnant
females, yielding a final analytic sample of 6936 adolescents from
the following race/ethnic groups: 5061 whites, 745 Mexicans, 204
Puerto Ricans, 198 Cubans, 115 Central/South Americans, 93
Other Hispanics (Dominicans and Hispanics of mixed ancestry),
175 Chinese, 252 Filipinos, 93 Other Asians (combination of
Koreans, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Asian Indians). Respondents
contributed anywhere from 1 to 3 height and weight observations
(wave II ­ wave IV; mean = 2.9 observations across 6936
individuals) for longitudinal analyses (mean follow-up of 12 years).
Measures
Outcome. Height (m) and weight (kg) were measured at
waves II through IV during in-home surveys using standardized
procedures. Before computing BMI (weight (kg)/height (m)2), we
excluded implausible height (n = 44) and weight (n = 17) values. In
the case where height change declined by .4 inch inches
(n = 158), we substituted stable adult height across visits using
mean values from exams where males were .17 years and females
were .15 years, or set values to missing if no such height
measures were available at these ages. We utilized repeated,
continuous measures for the dependent variable, BMI, in
longitudinal models. Even though BMI z-scores have been
identified as the optimal measure of body mass at a single time
point for children, raw BMI scores are recommended to evaluate
change in body mass during childhood and adolescence in
longitudinal studies. [16­18] Briefly, the CDC/NCHS reference
curves are based on repeated cross-sections and thus do not
adequately capture individual growth patterns. Furthermore,
given the heterogeneity in our cohort and the fact that the
CDC/NCHS reference curves do not adequately capture this
ethnic diversity in Hispanics and Asians ­ the primary groups of
interest in our study, BMI Z-scores are not ideal.
Independent variables. Data on ethnicity and country of
origin/ancestry were obtained by respondent and parental self-
report at wave I. A single race/ethnicity variable was created and
used to compare BMI patterns across Hispanic and Asian
subgroups relative to the non-Hispanic white referent group.
Immigrant generation was based on adolescents' and parents'
place of birth. Generation one included children not born on the
mainland U.S., Alaska or Hawaii. Although Puerto Ricans are
U.S. citizens by birth, we classified Puerto Rican-born respondents
as first generation as per the established acculturation-based
approach [11,19]. Generation two or greater included U.S.-born
children with either foreign-born or U.S.-born parents.
Markers of childhood socioeconomic status (SES) included
parental education and welfare receipt prior to age 18 years.
Parents' education was measured as the higher of either the
mother's or father's education: less than high school, high school/
GED, some college, and college degree or more. Welfare receipt
was constructed from data on the family's receipt of public
assistance/welfare from waves I and II, in combination with a
retrospective report at wave III.
Lifestyle behaviors. We also explored whether behaviors
known to influence adolescent BMI and BMI change could
explain observed ethnic differences. Current smoking (yes/no),
screen time (hours of TV, video, and computer game use per
week), and physical activity (weekly bouts of moderate to vigorous
physical activity) were ascertained at all waves. These measures
were based on standard, interview-administered questionnaires
validated in other epidemiologic studies [20]. Using responses
from the waves I and II In-Home Questionnaires, we also
ascertained whether respondents regularly skipped breakfast (yes/
no).

Other controls: respondents' age at each exam and sex (male/
female).
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were performed using Stata software, version 12.1
(Stata Corp, College Station, Texas). Descriptive analyses used
post-stratification sample weights to reflect national population
estimates. Adjusted Wald tests compared means and design-based
F-tests compared the distribution of categorical variables across
ethnic groups. All analyses used multiple stages of cluster sampling
to adjust for survey design effects.
We used mixed linear spline models with the unstructured
covariance specification to estimate Hispanic and Asian subgroup
differences in mean baseline BMI and in BMI change, relative to
non-Hispanic whites, as adolescents aged into adulthood. Mixed
models are well suited for studies of individual changes over time,
using repeated measures of an outcome to estimate a growth
trajectory defined by an intercept (baseline) and a slope (rate of
change). These models allow for missing outcome data, so that all
participants with at least one BMI measure were included in the
analyses. Age (in years) represented the measure of time.
Smoothing splines were used to characterize the non-linear
relationship between age and BMI. Various numbers and positions
of knots were compared to find the best fit for the data. The
optimal model had one knot placed at age 20 years, based on a
comparison of the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) across the
different models tested. Age was centered at the earliest observed
age, so that the model intercept represented mean BMI at age 12.
The slope represents the change in BMI per increase in year of
age. Random effects at the individual level were included for the
intercept and linear age term, allowing both intercept and linear
slope to vary between individuals.
The base model included the race/ethnicity variable and
interactions between race/ethnicity and the linear age and age
spline terms, adjusting for sex and study site region. The coefficient
for the race/ethnicity term tested whether, at age 12, mean BMI
differed across the five Hispanic and three Asian subgroups
compared to non-Hispanic whites. The interactions tested whether
the BMI trajectories after age 12 (linear age term), and after age 20
(age spline term), differed by race/ethnicity. We subsequently
introduced predictors for immigrant generation, SES, and
behaviors in sequential models to investigate whether these social
and behavioral factors explained observed ethnic differences in
BMI. We assessed potential confounding by evaluating whether
their inclusion changed model estimates. All covariates, except for
time-varying variables, were also interacted with the age terms.
Continuous variables (screen time and physical activity) were
centered on their grand means to facilitate model interpretation.
Interaction terms between sex and race/ethnicity at baseline and
with the age terms were also tested to investigate whether race/
ethnic patterns differed for males and females. In sensitivity
analyses, we restricted the sample to respondents ,16 years of age
at baseline. Although some ethnic-specific estimates were no
longer significant, the magnitude and direction of the associations
were consistent with the results we report for the overall sample
(results not shown).

health behaviors. For example, smoking rates were lower for all
Hispanic subgroups compared to whites in adolescence and in
adulthood. Puerto Ricans were the exception as smoking rates were
comparable to whites in adolescence, and exceeded rates among
whites in adulthood.
Asians. ChineseandOtherAsianshadsignificantlylowermean

was slightly lower than whites, this difference was not statistically

Multi-variable Analyses
In age, sex, and region-adjusted models, there were no
significant differences in mean BMI at age 12 for any of the
Hispanic subgroups compared to whites (Model 1, Table 2 and
Figure 1A). However the significant, positive coefficients for the
BMI slopes for Mexicans (MX) and Puerto Ricans (PR) relative to
whites indicated a faster rise in BMI from age 12 to ,20 years
(hereafter referred to as `adolescence') (MX: b = .15 kg/m2,
SE = .03; PR: b = .10 kg/m2, SE = .06) and from age 20 years
and on (hereafter referred to as `adulthood') (MX: b = 0.08 kg/m2,
SE = .02; PR: b = .11 kg/m2, SE = .04). Although BMI tended to
increase more slowly for Cubans and faster for Central/South
Americans in adolescence, there was little difference in the rate of
BMI growth after the age of 20 years compared to whites.
Among Asians, mean BMI at baseline (age 12 years) was
significantly lower than whites for all Asian subgroups: Chinese
(b = 21.71 kg/m2, SE = .40), Filipinos (b = 21.01 kg/m2,
SE = .39), and Other Asians (b = 21.58 kg/m2, SE = .75) (Model
1, Table 2 and Figure 1B). Although results indicated no
significant differences in the rate of BMI change in adolescence
compared to whites for all Asians, the magnitude of the estimate
for Filipinos suggested a slightly faster rise for this subgroup
(b = 0.07 kg/m2, SE = .06). After age 20 years, BMI increased to a
significantly slower extent for all Asians compared to whites.
In sequential models, we added immigrant generation (Model 2),
parental SES (Model 3), and health behaviors (Model 4). After
adjustingforthehigherproportionofimmigrantsamongmanyofthe
Hispanic subgroups (Model 2, Table 2), mean difference estimates in
baseline BMI increased for Cubans and Central/South Americans.
Inotherwords,ifnotforthehealth`protective'influenceofimmigrant
status, compared to whites, Cubans would have higher mean BMI at
age 12 years, and Central/South Americans would have more
similar mean BMI values. Central/South Americans also exhibited
faster increases in BMI in adolescence after adjusting for immigrant
status (b = 0.16 kg/m2, SE = .09).
In Asians, immigrant status partially attenuated mean BMI
differences at age 12 in all subgroups, but to a greater extent
among Filipinos. While not statistically significant, the larger BMI
slope estimate also pointed to an increase in the magnitude of the
BMI change during adolescence for Filipinos relative to whites.

After adjusting for the high proportion of low SES across Hispanic
groups, mean differences in BMI at age 12 decreased appreciably
for all subgroups, but there was little impact on longitudinal
estimates (Model 3, Table 2). In all Asians, there was additional
attenuation of BMI differences at baseline with the addition of
parental SES, though these estimates remained statistically
significant for all subgroups except Filipinos.
Skippingbreakfast,higherscreentime,lowerphysicalactivity,and
not currently smoking were all highly associated with higher BMI
(Model 4, Table 2). Among Hispanics, although baseline ethnic
differences in BMI were even further attenuated, there was little
change to longitudinal estimates. In other words, the faster BMI
increases in adolescence and adulthood for Mexicans and Puerto
Ricans, and in adolescence for Central/South Americans, remained
unexplained after inclusion of social and behavioral covariates. For
Asians, rather than attenuating estimates, accounting for lifestyle
behaviors further magnified BMI differences at age 12 years among
Chinese, Filipinos, and Other Asians compared to whites. These
behaviors also did not explain the faster BMI increase in adolescence
among Filipinos, or the slower BMI increases in adulthood exhibited
by all Asian subgroups relative to whites.
Some race/ethnic patterns in baseline (age 12 years) BMI and
BMI change differed by sex in the fully adjusted model (Model 4;
P-interaction ,0.0001). To facilitate interpretation, predicted
values using coefficients from this fully-adjusted model stratified by
sex were plotted in separate figures for Hispanic (Figures 2A, 2B)
and Asian (Figures 2C, 2D) females and males compared to whites.
Among Hispanic females, there were no race/ethnic differences in
adolescent BMI after covariate adjustment as in the overall sample
(Figure 2A), but among males, Other Hispanics had significantly
lower BMI at age 12 years than whites (Figure 2B). During the
transition to adulthood, although Cuban females had similar rates
of BMI increase as white females, consistent with findings from the
main effects model, Cuban males exhibited significantly larger
increases than white males during both adolescence and adult-
hood. By the time respondents reached adulthood, all Hispanic
females, except Cubans, had higher BMI than white females, and
all Hispanics males, except Other Hispanics, had higher BMI than
white males. Among Asians, the lower adolescent BMI and slower
BMI increases in Chinese relative to whites occurred to a
significantly greater extent in females than males (Figures 2C, 2D).
Discussion
We investigated whether BMI trajectories differed across
subgroups of Hispanics and Asians relative to white adolescents
transitioning to adulthood and evaluated what social and
behavioral factors might underlie these disparities. Among
Hispanics, Mexican and Puerto Rican-origin individuals exhibited
faster increases in BMI both in adolescence and in adulthood and
these patterns were not attributable to the social and behavioral
factors we measured. There was also evidence of emerging
disparities among Cuban males, and among Central/South
Americans relative to whites In Asians, the pattern previously
reported in the literature whereby Asians overall had lower BMI
than whites was observed here for all three subgroups ­ Chinese,
Filipino, and Other Asians - in age and sex-adjusted models. All
Asians also experienced slower BMI increases in adulthood
relative to whites. However in adolescence, the BMI of Filipinos
appeared to converge to levels found in whites. This was especially
evident after accounting for immigrant status and SES which also
attenuated BMI differences between Filipinos and whites at age 12
years. BMI differentials between Chinese and whites and Other
Asians and whites, however, remained unexplained.
Previous studies in young children have documented higher
BMI and faster BMI gains among Hispanics relative to whites and
Blacks. In an analysis of data from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study, the largest BMI gains during the elementary
school years occurred between 1st and 3rd grade; and across race/
ethnic groups, Hispanic boys and girls had the most excess gains
relative to whites [21]. Other work also showed that among
children aged 6­11 years, Mexican-American boys and girls had
higher obesity prevalence than whites, and among boys, preva-
lence was also higher in Mexican-Americans than Blacks [22].
Much of this research has examined Hispanics as a single group,
or has reported findings that pertain only to Mexican-Americans.
Studies that have investigated BMI differences by subgroup have
been entirely cross-sectional [10,11], and thus are unable to
examine when disparities emerge and how they pattern into
adulthood within the same individual. Our findings suggest that,
especially for Hispanics, BMI disparities relative to whites tend to
be concentrated among Mexican and Puerto Rican origin
individuals, regardless of sex, and these disparities considerably
worsen as they get older. The adverse patterns we report for

Ethnic Differences in Body Mass Index Trajectories

Cuban males throughout adolescence and adulthood and among
Central/South Americans in adolescence also points to the
emergence of disparities for other Hispanic subgroups as well.
While BMI at age 12 did not differ significantly from whites, the
faster BMI increases in adolescence among Mexicans and Puerto
Ricans suggests that factors during and prior to this life stage may
contribute to adverse body mass patterning for the two largest U.S.
Hispanic subgroups [12]. However despite adjustment for several
social and behavioral covariates, we could not account for the
steeper BMI trajectories we observed. Conversely, we also could
not explain why Chinese and Other Asian adolescents in
particular had a lower adolescent BMI and a slower trajectory
of increase. Change in body mass, at a proximal level, is a function
of health behaviors linked to energy intake and expenditure.
Although we had time-varying information available on key
determinants of adolescent weight gain, such as physical activity,
screen time, and smoking, one major limitation of this work was
the lack of 24-hour dietary recall information and/or longitudinal
dietary data which may have better accounted for race/ethnic
differences in BMI trajectories.
We also cannot rule out the role of genetic factors in driving
susceptibility to increase in body mass among some Hispanics, and
the differential susceptibility among Chinese and Other Asians
relative to whites. Contemporary research is in the process of
disentangling the role of genetic influences, particularly as they
relate to the propensity for obesity and weight gain [23]. However
the population heterogeneity of Hispanics and Asians poses a
challenge for genetic health studies of nationalities or ethnic
groups since within-group genetic heterogeneity can arguably be
greater than across race/ethnic groups [24]. As a result, rather
than explain race/ethnic disparities, genetic markers may instead
be useful for investigating within-race/ethnic group differences to
further identify at-risk subgroups.
Beyond biological factors, adolescent body mass and its change
over time are also strongly influenced by social, cultural, and other
environmental factors that we did not account for [25]. For
example, there is research to suggest that there may be cultural
factors linked to perception of ideal body weight [26,27], and
differential access to physical environmental and health-promoting
resources [28­30], which may also contribute to ethnic differences
in BMI trajectories from adolescence into adulthood. Future
research should consider the role that such factors play in race/
ethnic subgroup patterning of BMI.
There were some additional limitations. Although Add Health
over-sampled select ethnic groups, we nevertheless had small
sample sizes for some categories which may have limited statistical
power to test associations. Along these lines, grouping `Other
Asians' and `Other Hispanics' also likely masked important
associations for distinct ethnicities such as Japanese, Indian-
Americans, Vietnamese, etc., and for Hispanic ethnicities such as

Dominicans. Just as there is heterogeneity by ethnicity among
Hispanics and Asians, there is also ethnic heterogeneity among
whites that we did not account for.
Therewerealsootherpotentialexplanatoryfactorsthatwedidnot
assess. Early life circumstances associated with fetal under-nutrition,
low birthweight, and infant formula feeding have been associated
withrapidgrowthininfantsandyoungchildren,predisposingthemto
adult obesity and its associated risks [31], especially when exposed to
environments that promote positive energy balance. Future work
should also assess the role of potential early life determinants in
explaining race/ethnic disparities in BMI.
Overlookingwithin-groupheterogeneityintheBMItrajectoriesof
HispanicsandAsiansinthetransitionfromadolescencetoadulthood
masks important differences regarding how and when disparities
emerge. We noted the development of BMI disparities for Mexicans
and Puerto Ricans relative to whites that appeared to emerge in
adolescence and widened into adulthood, and of a disparity that
extended to other subgroups like Cuban males and to a lesser extent,
among Central/South Americans. Obesity has consequences for
diabetesandothermetabolicabnormalities,andHispanicshavebeen
shown to have among the highest risk of developing such
complications [32]. As a result, our findings that most Hispanic
subgroups were at risk of more rapid gains in BMI in the transition
from adolescence to adulthood when the antecedents for chronic
disease develop, will have implications for future chronic disease
burdenintheU.S.,andforexacerbatingHispanic-whitedisparitiesin
adulthood. For Asians, `protection' against higher BMI in adoles-
cence among Filipinos was largely attributable to their socio-
demographic profile. However social and behavioral factors did not
account for Chinese-white and Other Asian-white differentials.
Despite their lower BMI, Chinese-origin individuals in particular
havebeenshowntobeatincreasedriskfordiabetesatloweradiposity
thresholds than other race/ethnic groups [33,34]. Thus, the lower
baselineBMIandslowerBMIincreasewereportforChinesedoesnot
necessarily reflect a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease.
Future research should seek to understand what other factors may
underlie existing race/ethnic disparities in BMI. Identification of
these factors will allow for improved targeting of obesity prevention
efforts in ethnically-diverse youth.
