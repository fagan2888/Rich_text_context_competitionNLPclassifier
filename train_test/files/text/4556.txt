Introduction
What is acculturation? Acculturation is a process character-
ized by changes in one's culture, which occurs when people
(mainly immigrants and native-born minorities) adjust to the
mainstream culture of a plural society (Sam, 2000).
Acculturation as a phenomenon has received attention since
the 19th century, and within the 21st century, a number of
acculturation theories have been postulated (Rudmin, 2009).
In recent times, acculturation has evolved from a unidimen-
sional concept of assimilation, such as the American melting
pot model, to a complex concept of biculturalism or cultural
identity involving multiple factors (Berry, 2003). One recur-
ring theme in the literature is the relationship between accul-
turation, mental health, and physical health (Alex-Assensoh,
2009; Bhugra, 2003; Israel, Baker, Goldenhar, Heaney, &
Schurman, 1996; Kent, 2007; Millar, 1990). Each ethnic/
racial group in the United States is bound to experience the
relationship between these variables (i.e., acculturation,
mental and physical health) differently. This, along with the
rapidly increasing cultural diversity within the North
American continent (Ramos, 2005), has necessitated the
study of acculturation and its current impact on the public.
Migration is usually associated with educational, societal,
economic, health care, and demographic variations (Aroian,
2005). During the acculturation process, a combination of
these factors and experiences instigate stressful life changes
that lead to what Berry (1992) called acculturative stress.
Simply put, acculturative stress is responsible for lowering
the overall and adequate level of functioning of an individual
due to exposure to a variety of social and cultural stressors.
In 2001, Berry identified four characteristics as the founda-
tion upon which acculturation is based. These characteristics
include one's cultural heritage, cultural identity, relationship
with out-group members, and the ethnic minority/majority
perspective on the acculturation strategies utilized to adapt to
the mainstream cultural way of living.
Berry proposed four acculturation patterns, which are
(a) assimilation, (b) separation, (c) integration, and (d)

Acculturation: A Pilot Study on Nigerians
in America and Their Coping Strategies
Nnenna Ndika1
Abstract
The primary purpose of the study was to identify acculturation group memberships of first-generation Nigerian immigrants
in the United States of America, based on socio-demographics data. The study also determined the relative power of the
predictor variables in the classification. The accuracy with which the sample participants were classified into acculturation
groups was also explored. One hundred four first-generation Nigerian immigrants (N = 104) were recruited for the study.
These participants lived in different states across the United States. Discriminant function analysis (DFA) was conducted to
determine acculturation group memberships, the relative power of the predictors, as well as the accuracy of classification
of the sample. Findings suggested that the Nigerian immigrants were classified into five acculturation groups, which were
integration, assimilation, separation, assimilation and separation, as well as integration and assimilation. The assimilation and separation
acculturation strategy was most frequently endorsed by the Nigerian sample, whereas the integration option was the least
reported. The most powerful discriminant functions were immigration support and self-efficacy. Reclassification accuracy
was 64.8%. Nigerians in the United States, and perhaps Africans in general, may be using two parallel acculturation strategies
to navigate the mainstream culture in plural societies. This preference is likely linked to their multicultural backgrounds.
Therefore, integration as an acculturation strategy may not be the favored option among Nigerians living in the United States.
Furthermore, immigration support and self-efficacy were revealed as important markers for the classification of the Nigerian
sample into acculturation groups. These are areas that require further exploration.

marginalization. From the ethnic minority perspective, Berry
(2001) described assimilation as the willingness to adapt to the
host culture at the expense of losing one's cultural heritage and
identity. Separation was defined as the preference for the
retention of one's cultural heritage at the expense of adapting
to the new culture. Integration was described as the willing-
ness to learn some aspects of the host culture, as well as the
willingness to retain some aspects of one's cultural heritage
and identity. Finally, marginalization was explained as mean-
ing one's unwillingness to retain one's cultural heritage or
identity, as well as the unwillingness to learn the new culture.
The acculturation strategies that immigrants use to adjust
to a foreign culture have been univocally linked, in many
cases, to both psychological and physical well-being.
Therefore, it has become pertinent to determine the accul-
turation patterns among the different ethnic subpopulations
in the United States, especially among groups that are his-
torically understudied such as Nigerian immigrants.
Identifying the acculturation patterns among Nigerians in the
United States and the Diaspora in general would provide
valuable insights about an additional area to assess when
Nigerian immigrants need mental health services.
Furthermore, the acculturation strategies that people use
to fit into a novel culture can be predicted by certain socio-
demographics variables. According to Iman (2008), some
variables that predict acculturation attitudes are age, resi-
dency, education, and so forth. Therefore, the purpose of the
present study was to identify acculturation group member-
ships based on socio-demographics (predictor variables)
data. In addition, the relative power of these predictor vari-
ables and the accuracy with which the sample was classified
were also at the crux of the research project.
Design
As part of a larger research project, the current pilot study was
conducted to predict acculturation group memberships among
first-generation Nigerian immigrants. The study also sought
to determine the relative power of the predictors and the accu-
racy of classification. Acculturation was the dependent vari-
able (grouping variable) in the study. This variable had five
levels, which were integration, assimilation, separation,
assimilation and separation, assimilation and integration.
Although immigrants commonly endorse marginalization as
an acculturation strategy, among the current study sample the
use of this strategy was not reported. The independent vari-
ables (predictors) were the socio-demographics data and psy-
chological constructs. The psychological variables were
depression, anxiety, stress, and self-efficacy.
Method
Participants
One hundred four (104) adults, who are first-generation
Nigerian immigrants, and who resided in different states
across the United States, were recruited for the study. There
were 44.20% (n = 46) male and 55.80% (n = 58) female
participants, respectively. Mean age of the participants was
M = 45.38 years, with age range from 19 years to 86 years,
and standard deviation, SD = 11.82 years. The inclusion cri-
teria for participation in the study were (a) being raised in
Nigeria and (b) being 18 years or older. The exclusion crite-
ria were (a) poor literacy and lack of fluency in the English
language and (b) having active psychoses.
Instruments
Socio-demographics questionnaire.A socio-demographics
questionnaire was developed specifically for the study. This
instrument has 33 items. The socio-demographics question-
naire was used to gather information on participant age, sex,
current employment status, current physical and mental
health statuses, current income, residential area, job satisfac-
tion, place of birth, marital status, years of legal residency in
the United States, immigration experience, level of social
support, influences on choice of destination country, the
highest level of education attained, and so forth.
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21 (DASS-21).DASS-21
(Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) is a short-form version of the
full Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS), which is a
42-item measure. The DASS-21 has three subscales (7 items
for each subscale), which were used to collect data on depres-
sion, anxiety, and stress.
Self-Efficacy Scale (SES). SES (Sherer et al., 1982) is a mea-
sure for self-efficacy. The scale is a 30-item inventory
designed to measure (a) general self-efficacy and (b) social
self-efficacy (Sherer et al., 1982). Omoluabi (1999) revali-
dated the SES to foster its suitability to Nigerians. According
to Omoluabi, the SES assesses (a) competence and effective-
ness in work performances and (b) efficacy in handling social
relationships among Nigerians.
Procedure
Participants completed a socio-demographics questionnaire,
and an acculturation measure, the Nigerian-American
Systemic Acculturation Scales (NASAS; Ndika, 2012,
unpublished). The acculturation tool was constructed for use
on Nigerian immigrants in the Diaspora, particularly in the
United States. The socio-demographics questionnaire and
the NASAS were administered, along with measures for self-
efficacy, depression, anxiety, and stress. The subscale scores
obtained from the NASAS were submitted to the Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) discriminant func-
tion analysis (DFA), to determine acculturation group mem-
berships. That is, the acculturation strategies the current
sample uses to adapt to the American mainstream culture.
The relative importance of each predictor variable in classi-
fying the Nigerian immigrant sample into various
Ndika 3
acculturation groups, as well as the classification accuracy of
the model, was also determined.
A correlation matrix was generated to examine the rela-
tionships between the socio-demographics data, the psycho-
logical constructs, and acculturation. Of the predictor
variables, seven correlated most strongly with acculturation
(grouping variables). These seven predictor variables had
conceptual meanings, which supported their suitability as
independent variables in the DFA. The variables were sex,
residential area, length of residency, influences on choice of
destination in the country, stressful immigration experience,
social support, and self-efficacy.
Results
Of the total sample, $60,000 was the median annual income,
76% were university graduates, 76% were married, and 74%
were gainfully employed. See Table 1 for a summary of
socio-demographics variables of the study sample.
DFA
On the first iteration, most of the cases were not accounted
for. This suggested that some of the sample participants
might have reported the use of more than one acculturation
strategy. Rudmin (2006, p.1), who is a prominent acculturation
researcher, wrote, "The acculturation paradigm of measuring
assimilation, separation, integration and marginalization
confuses dimensional and categorical conceptions of its con-
structs, fails to produce ipsative data from mutually exclu-
sive scales . . .." Based on this premise, combinations of
acculturation strategies were derived from the three basic
acculturation patterns (integration, separation, and assimila-
tion) that emerged from principal component analysis of the
NASAS. (These acculturation patterns were derived from the
larger project.)
Following further computations, five acculturation groups
emerged, which were integration, separation, assimilation,
integration and assimilation, as well as assimilation and sep-
aration. Consequently, of the 104 cases submitted to SPSS
DFA, 71 cases were processed. This number of cases satis-
fied the minimum ratio of valid cases to independent vari-
ables, 10:1 (Garson, 2008). See Table 2 for a summary of the
acculturation groups that emerged from the current sample
data.
Of the seven predictor variables, three significant predic-
tors were identified. These significant predictors included
stressful immigration experience, social support, and self-
efficacy. Three additional predictor variables approached
significance. These were residential area (p = .067), length
of residency (p = .053), and influences on choice of destina-
tion country (p = .070). Sex (p = .156) was irrelevant as a
predictor in this model. See Table 3 for a summary of the
significant predictors in the discriminant function model.

For the current data, the assumption of homogeneity was
not violated. This finding suggested that the variances in
each of the acculturation groups were approximately equal.
Refer to Table 4 for a summary of the Box's M test of equal-
ity of covariance matrices.
Of the four discriminant functions that emerged from the
analyses, only two functions were significant. The first dis-
criminant function was significant at  = .319, 2(28, N = 71)
= 73.41, p = .000, and the second function was significant at
 = .543, 2(18, N = 71) = 39.14, p = .003. The structure coef-
ficients indicated correlations between the predictor variables
and discriminant functions, from which meaningful names
were derived for each dimension. Discriminant Function 1,
which was the most important dimension, had to do with
social support and stressful immigration experience. Function
1 was named immigration support, thereby producing a new
variable (name) used to discriminate between acculturation
groups. Discriminant Function 2 was self-efficacy.
Function 1 had a canonical correlation of .642 (p. = .000)
between the predictor variables and the acculturation groups,
while Function 2 had a slightly lower canonical correlation
of .608 (p = .003). Combining the information from the
structure weights and canonical coefficients, the variables
appeared to be strongly related to Discriminant Functions 1
and 2, respectively. This, as it seemed was because of their
large structure weights, as well as their unique contribution
to the model (standardized canonical coefficients). Refer to
Table 5 for a summary of the standardized canonical coeffi-
cients and the structure weights of the variables.
Analyses of the Discriminant Functions (i.e., the
Dimensions)
Immigration support (Function 1). The sample participants in
the integration and assimilation group reported having the
most support during the immigration process. Following the
integration and assimilation acculturation group were those
in the assimilation category, who endorsed they received
immigration support, but to a lesser extent than those in the
former group. Participants classified in the separation group
reported they received immigration support, which was less
adequate than the amount the Nigerians in the assimilation
category reported they received. Furthermore, the Nigerians
classified in the assimilation and separation acculturation
group, as well as those who were categorized in the integra-
tion group, endorsed that they experienced the least amount
of support during immigration.
Self-efficacy (Function 2). The Nigerian participants classified
in the assimilation and separation category reported having
the highest self-efficacy ratings, which was followed by the
endorsements of those in the integration and assimilation
group. Participants in the separation category reported the
lowest self-efficacy ratings. Although the participants in the
integration group also reported having the tendency for low
levels of self-efficacy, their ratings were observed to be
slightly higher than those, who were classified in the separa-
tion category. Participants in the assimilation group endorsed
self-efficacy ratings that fell between the levels endorsed by
the participants, who had indicated the lowest self-efficacy
ratings (i.e., members of integration and separation groups),
and those who had endorsed the highest levels of self-effi-
cacy (i.e., members of the assimilation and separation group,
and integration and assimilation group). Findings suggested
that immigration support and self-efficacy ratings are the
important markers for classifying Nigerian immigrants based
on the acculturation strategies they utilize as they adapt to
the American mainstream culture. Figure 1 presents a scatter
plot graph of the various acculturation groups, which were
differentiated on the basis of immigration support and
self-efficacy.
Approximately sixty-four percent (64.8%) of the cases
were reclassified correctly by the DFA, which meant that,
with a chance factor of 50%, 46 of the 71 cases were correctly
reclassified. This percentage is probably an overestimation of
the classification accuracy of the model, because it was tested
with the same sample used to construct the model. Cross-
validation on a different and a larger Nigerian immigrant
sample is necessary. This is important especially when the
discriminant function model is to be used in the clinical set-
ting, rather than to describe group differences for theoretical

Discussion
Individuals living in plural societies might have to develop a
variety of acculturation strategies, with which they navigate
and cope with the multicultural contexts and diversity of the
people with whom they interact. Most of the Nigerian par-
ticipants, who had resided in the United States for more than
20 years (n = 33), might have developed complex strategies
with which they adapt to the American lifestyle. The major-
ity of the sample reported that they simultaneously use the
assimilation and separation (n = 25, 24%) acculturation
strategy to adapt to the mainstream culture in the United
States. The sample endorsed integration (n = 10, 9.6%) as
being their least utilized acculturation strategy. The latter
finding is contrary to the predominant viewpoint in
literature.
Rudmin (2006) suggested that immigrants, aboriginal
people, and the native-born ethnic minority often strive for
assimilation into the prevailing culture of a plural society.
This means that assimilation is generally perceived as the
end result of the acculturation process. Literature further
suggests that assimilation into the mainstream culture in a
plural society is often preceded by the integration of one's
indigenous culture and the new culture. This can be inter-
preted as follows: Integration is the starting point for many
individuals, who have the desire to be assimilated into the
host culture (Rudmin, 2006).
Literature on the preferred acculturation strategies used
by immigrants and ethnic minorities is mixed. On the one
hand, literature reveals that unidimensional acculturation
strategies are used by immigrants and ethnic minorities in
plural societies to adapt to the mainstream cultural way of
living (Unger et al., 2002; Ward, 1999, as cited in Rudmin,
2006). Conversely, the utility of bidimensional acculturation
patterns is also widespread among immigrants, ethnic minor-
ities, and aborigines (Jang, Kim, Chiriboga, & Kallimanis,
2007; Ryder, Alden, & Paulhus, 2000).
Literature that supports the use of the bidimensional
approach to acculturation suggests that individuals navigate
multicultural contexts from more than one cultural perspec-
tive. This is opposed to the unidimensional approach to
acculturation, where individuals are believed to approach
acculturation from one isolated cultural standpoint, as they
adapt to multicultural contexts. When an individual navi-
gates multicultural contexts from at least two cultural per-
spectives, he or she is said to use the integration acculturation
strategy. Integration, which is interchangeably referred to as
biculturalism, is unanimously defined as the retention of
some aspects of one's cultural heritage and identity, as well
as learning some aspects of the host culture (Berry, 1970,
1992, 2001; Rudmin, 2006). The Nigerian immigrant sample
may be adjusting to the American cultural life, differently.
Since the majority of Nigerians in the current study have
lived for many years in the United States, it is likely they
have modified their ethnic identity. Ethnic identity is one's
perceived membership in a social, cultural, and ethnic group,
within which similarities such as cognitions, emotions, phi-
losophies, and other characteristics are shared (Ashmore,
Deaux, & McLaughlin-Volpe, 2004; Phinney, 1990; Watson,
2002). A large number of participants in the present study
appeared to have a flexible ethnic identity, within which they
perceive themselves as being Nigerian (separated), as well as
being American (assimilated).
Ethnic identity flexibility could be described as having an
ethnic self-concept, which gives individuals the malleability

to shift between levels of meanings, depending of course on
the social or cultural contexts they have to face. The finding
is not surprising. After all, literature has shown that immi-
grants maintain, and in some cases promote, their mental
health by engaging in their traditional practices, economic
freedom, as well as the willingness to learn about the host
culture (Knipscheer & Kleber, 2007). To this end, it may be
an appropriate intervention to encourage and support immi-
grants in general to develop a flexible ethnic identity to facil-
itate the adaptation process.
Therefore, in this study, the assimilation and separation
acculturation strategy should be seen as markedly distinct
from integration. The integration acculturation strategy was
the least endorsed by the Nigerian immigrant sample, while
the former strategy was mostly reported as the preferred
option. The definition of integration connotes a blending of
cultures (aspects of the indigenous culture and aspects of the
host culture), from which the emergence of a new and unique
product (subculture) is expected. This is not the case with
many of the Nigerian immigrant participants, who reported
that they have adjusted or are adapting to life in the United
States using two acculturation strategies, simultaneously
(i.e., separation and assimilation). Assimilation and separa-
tion are two acculturation strategies used by Nigerians as
circumstances demand. Thus, findings from the study do not
support integration as the most frequently endorsed accul-
turation strategy among this Nigerian immigrant sample, and
perhaps among Africans in the Diaspora, in general.
Merametdjian (1995; as cited in Rudmin, 2006) obtained
similar results as the current study. Merametdjian assessed
the acculturation patterns of Somali refugees in Norway. She
found that many of the Somali participants endorsed more
than one acculturation pattern, as their preferred adaptation
strategy. However, while the Somali participants most fre-
quently endorsed marginalization and integration, the cur-
rent Nigerian sample reported the use of assimilation and
separation.
Despite the strong similarities between Merametdjian's
study and the present study, there lies a major difference in
the interpretation of the respective findings. Merametdjian
(1995; as cited in Rudmin, 2006) and her mentor, Rudmin,
attributed the failure to produce mutually exclusive data
from the integration, assimilation, separation, and marginal-
ization subscales, to psychometric problems. It is possible
that psychometric problems may exist within many accul-
turation scales, as declared by Rudmin (2006), especially the
measures fashioned after Berry's model of acculturation.
Yet, this may be a literal interpretation. Underlying this lit-
eral interpretation, it is more likely that human beings do not
use, actually, cannot use, one exclusive acculturation strat-
egy during any adaption process.
Because acculturation is a dynamic process, it likely
demands multidimensional strategies. People are likely to
develop dominant and auxiliary strategies with which they
navigate and cope with multicultural contexts and diversity.
Therefore, to adjust to the American cultural lifestyle, immi-
grants, ethnic minorities, and even the ethnic majority might
have to develop multiple acculturation strategies. To this
end, it is logical to assume that acculturation strategies will
be used interchangeably depending on circumstances.
From a practical perspective, ethnic identity develop-
ment and the acculturation processes have similar pathways
(Watson, 2002). According to Cross (1978), there are three
main stages of ethnic identity development. These stages
include the pre-encounter stage, the encounter stage, a
transition period, and then the internalization stage. The
Nigerians who endorsed the assimilation and separation
acculturation strategy might also, simultaneously, be in the
internalization stage of ethnic identity development. The
internalization stage, which is the last stage of ethnic iden-
tity development, is described as the high point of adult
mental health (Cross, 1978). During the internalization
stage, immigrants especially those who have resided in their
new countries for a long time tend to become culturally flex-
ible, and aware of their personal and group power, as well as
freedom (Watson, 2002). This naturally fosters better self-
understanding and self-confidence, as well as the accep-
tance of other groups. This may be the Nigerian case.
Watson (2002) demonstrated the similarities between eth-
nic identity development, and the assimilation and separa-
tion acculturation pattern (used as interchangeable
acculturation strategies) among African immigrants from
Nigeria, Ghana, Sierra Leone, Uganda, and Ethiopia. One of
her participants, who is a Ghanaian immigrant, stated, "I tell
them (my children) every day. This house is Ghana. When
you go outside, that is America. Inside my house, this is
Ghana and you will do according to the Ghanaian culture.
They respect that." This strategy is true for many Africans in
the Diaspora. For many of the first-generation Nigerian
immigrants in the study, the assimilation and separation
acculturation strategies, especially when utilized inter-
changeably, might be a familiar and positive way of living
with culturally diverse people.
Kalin and Berry (1994) disclosed that people with multi-
cultural backgrounds might more readily accommodate and
respect other people, who are culturally different. This may
not be an enduring quality in people from predominantly uni-
cultural societies. Nigeria, like most African nations, is a
conglomeration of different ethnic nations bound together
under a common political and economic government. These
ethnic groups have unique customs, traditions, cultures, his-
tories, and languages. Yet, for decades, the members of these
diverse Nigerian ethnic groups have retained their unique-
ness, while mutually exchanging cultures and traditions with
one another. Therefore, the indigenous Nigerian can be said
to be constantly in contact with multiple cultural/social con-
texts. This is mostly true for those who have migrated from
the rural areas to urban centers within Nigeria.
As the present study shows, to every rule, there are usu-
ally exceptions. Although the majority of the Nigerian
Ndika 7
samples reported the use of the assimilation and separation
strategies, they also reported the use of alternative accultura-
tion strategies. The Nigerians, who endorsed both the inte-
gration and assimilation acculturation strategies, may have a
greater inclination to assimilate into, than separate from, the
American mainstream culture. Those who endorsed the use
of one strategy for adjusting to the American cultural life-
style may also be using an additional, but less preferred
acculturation option. Whatever strategies immigrants choose
to adopt during the acculturation process, the common ele-
ment is likely a longing to forge amicable relationships with
out-group members. This does not necessarily encourage the
loss of one's cultural identity and heritage (such as assimila-
tion into the host culture, or integration of both the host and
indigenous cultures, which connotes a blending of these cul-
tures). It is psychologically adaptive for individuals living in
multicultural societies to develop ethnic identity flexibility,
which encourages the use of acculturation strategies as situ-
ations demand.
In conclusion, Unger et al. (2002) and Ward (1999, as
cited in Rudmin, 2006) recorded similar results from their
respective studies. Their participants were Westerners and
Easterners, who endorsed the use of unidimensional accul-
turation strategies for adjusting to their host cultures. These
findings appeared to show a link between their unicultural
backgrounds and their preference for unidimensional accul-
turation strategies. Likewise, among Merametdjian's (1995;
as cited in Rudmin, 2006) Somalian participants in Norway,
and the current study's Nigerian participants in the United
States, their preferred acculturation styles appeared to be a
reflection of their multicultural backgrounds. These are
interesting areas that require further exploration.
