Factors Associated With Illegal Drug Use
Among Older Methadone Clients
Daniel Rosen, PhD1
Purpose. The overall aims of this study are to describe
the life stressors of, exposure to illegal drug use of, and
illegal drug use by older methadone clients. Design
and Methods. The current study focuses on a subsample
of the larger administrative data of a methadone clinic
that is limited to African American and White clients
over the age of 50 (N ¼ 143). A logistic regression
model tested the relationship between life stressors,
exposure to illegal drug use, and a respondent's ability
to remain abstinent from illegal drug use in the previous
month. Results. Older methadone clients exposed to
illegal drug use in their social networks and neighbor-
hoods were significantly more likely to use illegal drugs
in the last month. Implications. Although demographic
trends in the methadone population indicate that this
cohort is aging and that their numbers are growing, little
research exists on their well-being and service needs.
Key Words: Substance abuse, Opiate addiction,
Geriatric services
After a slight drop in the 1980s, the prevalence of
heroin addiction rose throughout the 1990s and is now
similar to levels in the 1970s. Current estimates suggest
that 810,000 individuals are dependent on heroin and
other opiates in the United States, but only 170,000 are
currently in methadone treatment (Fiellin, O'Connor,
Chawarski, Pakes, Pantalon, & Schottenfeld, 2001).
Nearly 10% of clients in methadone treatment are over
the age of 50, and more than one-third more are
between the ages of 40 and 49 (U. S. Department of
Health and Human Services, 1999).
The aging opiate-addicted cohort from the 1970s is
altering the demographic characteristics of individuals
in need of services for heroin addiction (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
[SAMHSA], 2002) and will potentially put a strain on
the resources of treatment and clinical programs
(Patterson & Jeste, 1999). As opiate-addicted individ-
uals age, health problems may be exacerbated by age-
related illness, social isolation, and general physical
decline and may require specialized medical ap-
proaches. Understanding the service needs of this aging
population of methadone clients will be critical in
effectively serving this vulnerable older population.
Limited research exists on the well-being of older
individuals addicted to opiates, and virtually no
research specifically addresses the well-being of older
methadone clients. In a 33-year follow-up of male
narcotic addicts with a mean age of 57.4, Hser,
Hoffman, Grella, and Anglin (2001) identified high
rates of health and mental health problems. Heroin
abstinence was a particularly important factor in
determining whether or not a respondent had a mental
health problem.
Whereas scant specific research on older heroin
addicts and methadone clients exists, the aging and
substance abuse literature provides important insights
into key variables for those individuals who are
attempting to remain drug-free. For instance, sub-
stance-abuse researchers identified retention in treat-
ment as being related to positive social support systems
and lower levels of stress among some substance
abusers (Dobkin, DeCivita, Paraherakis, & Gill, 2002;
Gainey, Wells, Hawkins, & Catalano, 1993). Yet, the

specific role of social support for addicted individuals is
notwellunderstood,andempiricalassessmentsinvolving
drug-addicted clients are scarce (Anderson, Dimidjian,
& Miller, 1995; Anderson, Stewart, & Dimidjian, 1994;
Blomqvist, 1996).
Even after controlling for income and education,
African Americans appear to be less likely to use mental
health and substance-abuse services than Whites
(Snowden, 1999). Other studies of African Americans
in methadone treatment reveal that African American
patients are more likely to receive lower dosages of
methadone than their White counterparts (D'Aunno &
Pollack, 2002). Despite these variances by race, most
research on the service needs of individuals addicted to
heroin focuses on White men while ignoring racial and
gender differences (Hser et al., 2001).
Research on older methadone clients may provide
useful insight into other vulnerable aging populations
(i.e., individuals with human immunodeficiency virus
[HIV] or mental health disorders) who also will face
age-related challenges. Previous studies on HIV con-
cerns for injection drug users over the age of 50 have
been funded by the National Institute on Aging and the
National Institute on Drug Abuse (Anderson & Levy,
2003; Auberbach, 2003). SAMHSA studies (2002) that
examined drug use in people over the age of 50
identified the relationship between aging, drug use, and
future treatment needs.
Given the dearth of empirical evidence about the
needs and well-being of older methadone clients, the
growing size of the population, and the potential
impact on service systems, the overall aims of this study
are threefold: (a) to describe the life stressors of,
exposure to illegal drug use of, and use of illegal drugs
by older methadone clients; (b) to examine gender and
racial differences in life stressors, exposure to illegal
drug use, and illegal drug use of these clients; and (c) to
examine the relationship between life stressors and
exposure to illegal drug use in a methadone client's
ability to remain abstinent from illegal drug use.
Design and Methods
Sample
This analysis is a review of administrative data of
clients at a methadone clinic in a small industrial city in
the midwestern United States. This study focuses on
a specific subsample of the larger administrative data
sample. It focuses on a subsample of African American
and White clients over the age of 50. Caseworkers
conducted interviews in September 2002 as part of
a monthly assessment. The final sample size was 143.
The current analysis includes all study-eligible cases.
The sample was restricted to African American and
White clients as the methadone clinic serves only these
populations. All respondents in the study were English
speaking. The decision to limit the sample to clients
over the age of 50 was driven by an emerging body of
research that focuses on this age range of illicit drug use
in later life (Gfroerer, Penne, Pemberton, & Folsom,
2003; Levy, 1998).
Demographic characteristics of the sample reveal
that 84.6% of the sample (n¼121) are between the ages
of 50 and 60. Over two-thirds of the sample is male
(69.9%), and slightly more than half the sample
(55.2%) is African American.
Measures
Demographic Variables.--Respondent's age, gen-
der, and race were sociodemographic control variables
used in the multivariate analysis.
Life Stressors.--Variables that indicate economic
well-being and living situations were specified as life
stressors. Economic well-being included whether a re-
spondent was currently employed or receiving public
assistance. Employment was defined as working either
full or part time at the time of the interview. Public
assistance receipt was defined as currently receiving
Social Security Insurance or Social Security Disability
or General Assistance. Unemployed clients who were
currently looking for work at the time of the interview
were also considered to have a life stressor. Life
stressors related to living situations included whether
a client was either temporarily staying with someone
else, living in a halfway house, or in a residential
treatment program.
Exposure to Drug Use in Social Networks and
Neighborhoods.--Exposure to drug use referred to a
clientwho hadeitheraromanticpartneror anonromantic
adult member of the household who was involved with
illicit drugs. Involvement with illicit drugs is defined as
having a romantic partner or an adult member of the
household who is either currently abusing illegal drugs
and/or currently in need of drug treatment. Clients also
identified whether or not they were currently living in
a place with either frequent or very frequent drug abuse or
trafficking. In addition, a dichotomous variable that
referred to any exposure to illegal drug use, which
included a romantic partner and/or adult member of the
household with the above-mentioned substance abuse
problems and living in a neighborhood with drug abuse/
trafficking, was created.
Illegal Drug Use in the Last Month.--The
methadone clinic conducted monthly urine tests to
examine whether or not a client had remained abstinent
from illegal drug use in the last month. The results
from these urine tests were coded ``0'' for no drug use
detected in the last month and ``1'' for the presence of
benzodiazepines, barbiturates, cocaine, opiates, or
other illegal substances in the last month.
Analyses
The initial research question for this study examines
the demographic factors, life stressors, and exposure to
illegal drugs and their relationship to an older
methadone client's ability to remain abstinent from
illegal drug use (based on the results from monthly
544 The Gerontologist
urine tests). Data were analyzed by using SPSS 11.0
(Chicago, IL). Descriptive analyses were used to
present differences by both gender and race on the
independent variables. v2 tests were used for all
comparisons. A logistic regression was employed to
test the relationship between life stressors and a re-
spondent's ability to remain abstinent from illegal drug
use in the previous month. The multivariate model
adds in each of the independent variables related to life
stressors (the various life stressors and exposure to
drug use) to determine which variables show statistical
significance when controlling for demographic factors.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive characteristics of
a sample of older methadone clients by both gender
and race. Over three-fourths (84.6%) of the respond-
ents are between the ages of 50 and 60 years. Slightly
more than half (55.2%) of the respondents are African
American, and over two-thirds (69.9%) are men.
Roughly one-third (30.1%) of the older methadone
clients over the age of 50 had a positive urine drug
screen test in the last month.
Although analyses by gender need to be interpreted
with some restraint, owing to the small number of
women in some of the cells, there are some interesting
differences that require further exploration. Women
were significantly more likely (67.4% vs. 53.0%) to
receive public assistance than men. In addition, women
were nearly three times as likely (9.3% vs. 3.0%) to
have an adult member of their household in need of
drug treatment.
The cohort of respondents who were over the age of
60 had three and a half times more African Americans
than Whites (22.8% vs. 6.3%). White respondents were
more likely (9.4% vs. 1.3%) to have an adult member
of the household in need of drug treatment than
African American respondents. In addition, Whites had
significantly higher rates of any drug exposure than
African Americans (35.9% vs. 20.3%).
Table 2 presents a logistic regression model of the
association among demographic variables, life stressors,
exposure to illegal drugs, and remaining abstinent from
illegal drug use in the last month for methadone clients
over the age of 50. A dichotomous variable was created
for exposure to illegal drug use that included respond-
ents who had a significant other who was abusing illegal
substances or in need of drug treatment, an adult mem-
ber of their household in need of drug treatment, or
living in a neighborhood with drug sales. In this model,

exposure to illegal drugs was significantly associated
with having used illegal drugs in the last month. Finan-
cial life stressors and living in an unstable environment
were not significantly associated with illegal drug use in
the last month; nor was race or gender. Specific items in
the dichotomous variable for exposure to illegal drugs
were also tested individually, and none was found to be
significant (analysis not reported).
Discussion
The findings in this article illuminate the challenges
that older methadone clients face as they age. These
results indicate that exposure to illegal drugs in
a respondent's social network and neighborhood is
significantly related to older methadone clients using
illegal drugs in the previous month. They also suggest
that for this older cohort of methadone clients, there
are important racial and gender differences. For
instance, future research will need to fully explore the
impact that intimates (significant others and adult
members of the household) play in a methadone client's
ability to remain abstinent.
These findings have important implications for
policy initiatives and funding of opiate addiction
programs at both the federal and the state levels. The
data indicate that as this population ages, there is still
a relatively high rate of drug usage, with nearly one-
third of older clients using illegal drugs in the last
month. The increased service needs of an aging opiate-
addicted population will place a financial strain on
existing resources. Funding programs that are directed
to this aging population may help to decrease overall
expenditures in the health and mental health field for
seniors addicted to opiates by allowing them to receive
care in appropriate settings.
There is also the potential that future research about
the lives of older methadone clients will help in the in-
tervention and treatment strategies of younger opiate-
addicted individuals. Heroin addiction and its effect on
one's lifestyle can have a devastating impact on an
individual's health and, in many cases, can be fatal.
Understanding the pathways that allow opiate-addicted
individuals to enter old age may provide insight into
strategies for intervening with younger addicts.
Historically, the lives of older methadone clients
have remained relatively hidden. Yet, older methadone
clients may also provide useful insight into other
vulnerable aging populations (i.e., individuals with
HIV or mental health problems) who will face
additional challenges as they age. Findings on the
relationship between exposure to illegal drug use in
one's social network and neighborhood are similar to
initial observations that physical locations and social
circumstances within which people interact can pro-
mote or discourage HIV risk behaviors (Schensul, Levy,
& Disch, 2003; Zinberg, 1984). The findings presented
in this article indicate that future research and
interventions for this population will need to consider
the interaction between behaviors and settings of long-
term opiate addiction.
The limits of administrative data were present in
this review, including the inability to generalize from
the data and the omission of key variables. Future
research with this population will benefit from the use
of age-appropriate measures for social support and
evaluation of life stressors for an older population.
More extensive questions regarding social support and
the continuum of support that is available may be
important factors to consider in evaluating an older
methadone client's ability to remain abstinent from
illegal drug use.
