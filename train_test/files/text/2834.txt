Abstract:
Multinational labor demand responds to wage differentials at the extensive margin,
when a multinational enterprise (MNE) expands into foreign locations, and at the
intensive margin, when an MNE operates existing affiliates across locations. We de-
rive conditions for parametric and nonparametric identification of an MNE model to
infer elasticities of labor substitution at both margins, controlling for location selec-
tivity. Prior studies rarely found foreign wages or operations to affect employment.
Our strategy detects salient adjustments for German MNEs. With a one-percent in-
crease in German wages, German MNEs add 2,000 manufacturing jobs in Eastern
Europe at the extensive margin and 4,000 jobs overall; a converse one-percent drop
in Eastern European wages is associated with an overall withdrawal of 730 MNE
jobs from Germany.

Non-technical summary
Permanent wage differentials across countries affect employment within multinational
enterprises (MNEs) at two critical margins. An MNE's labor demand responds to
international wage differentials at the extensive margin, when the MNE expands into a
foreign market, and at the intensive margin, when the MNE operates existing affiliates
and chooses employment. The authors derive novel parametric and nonparametric
estimation models to distinguish between the formation of MNEs at the extensive
margin and the operation of MNEs at the intensive margin. The methods extend the
existing literature on selectivity to the case of multiple simultaneous choices.
Using comprehensive data on German manufacturing MNEs and their majority-owned
foreign manufacturing affiliates, the paper finds permanent wage differentials to have a
strong impact on multinational labor substitution both at the extensive and the intensive
margin---contrary to much of the earlier empirical literature on MNEs. Results point to
large sunk entry and exit costs so that MNE expansions are infrequent but, when
undertaken, have a sizeable impact on labor demand. Home and foreign employment are
substitutes within MNEs at both margins. Cross-wage elasticities at the extensive margin
are about half the size of elasticities at the intensive margin in locations close to home.
For overseas developing country wages, however, elasticities are significantly different
from zero only at the extensive margin. Elasticity estimates at both margins are robust
across different samples and wage data, specifications, and parametric and nonparamet-
ric estimation techniques.
The authors evaluate the counterfactual question how many jobs MNEs would reallocate
in response to shrinking wage differentials. With a one-percent drop in German wages,
German MNEs would cut 2,000 manufacturing jobs in Central and Eastern Europe
(CEE) at the presence-establishing extensive margin, for instance, and withdraw 4,000
jobs overall. A converse one-percent increase in CEE wages is associated with an overall
return of 730 MNE jobs to Germany. These are sizeable figures. Wages in CEE are, on
average, about ten percent of the German level in 2000. If the estimated elasticities of
substitution were constant at all levels of wages, an increase in CEE wages of 450% to
cut the wage gap to Germany in half would bring 330,000 (730 \cdot 450) counterfactual
manufacturing jobs to Germany---about a quarter of the estimated home employment at
German manufacturing MNEs. Removing international wage differentials is, of course,
not a policy-relevant counterfactual exercise. Per-capita incomes converge across
regions at half times of more than thirty years. The authors indicate in their concluding
remarks that a future estimation method will assess whether worker displacements are
significantly lower at MNEs than at non-MNEs.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Dauerhafte internationale Lohnunterschiede beeinflussen die Beschäftigung in multinatio-
nalen Unternehmen (MU) an zwei kritischen Grenzen (margins). Die Arbeitsnachfrage
eines MUs reagiert auf Lohnunterschiede an der extensiven Grenze, wenn ein MU in einen
Auslandsmarkt expandiert, und an der intensiven Grenze, wenn ein MU bestehende
Auslandstöchter betreibt. Die Autoren leiten neue parametrische und nicht-parametrische
Schätzverfahren her, um zwischen der MU-Ausweitung an der extensiven Grenze und dem
MU-Betrieb an der intensiven Grenze zu unterscheiden. Die Schätzverfahren erweitern die
bestehende Literatur zu Selektivitätskorrekturen um den Fall mehrerer gleichzeitiger
Entscheidungen.
Auf der Grundlage von umfassenden Daten zu Auslandstöchtern im
verarbeitenden Gewerbe und deren Müttern im deutschen verarbeitenden Gewerbe ermittelt
das vorliegende Arbeitspapier, dass dauerhafte Lohnunterschiede die Arbeitssubstitution in
multinationalen Unternehmen sowohl an der extensiven als auch an der intensiven Grenze
erheblich beeinflussen - im Gegensatz zu einem großen Teil der bestehenden empirischen
Studien. Die Ergebnisse deuten auf umfangreiche fixe Marktzutritts- und -austrittskosten
hin, so dass Expansionen selten sind, aber, wenn unternommen, erhebliche Beschäfti-
gungswirkungen im MU mit sich bringen. Inlands- und Auslandsbeschäftigung sind
Substitute an beiden Grenzen. In an Deutschland angrenzenden Regionen sind Lohnelasti-
zitäten an der extensiven Grenze etwa halb so groß wie Lohnelastizitäten an der intensiven
Grenze. In außereuropäischen Entwicklungsländern dagegen sind ausschließlich
Lohnelastizitäten an der extensiven Grenze statistisch signifikant. Die geschätzten
Lohnelastizitäten an beiden Grenzen sind robust gegenüber zahlreichen Schätzstichproben
und unter Einbezug alternativer Lohndaten, Spezifikationen und parametrischer sowie
nicht-parametrischer Verfahren.
Die Autoren bewerten, wie viele Arbeitsplätze in MU umgruppiert würden,
wenn die internationalen Lohnunterschiede schrumpften. Auf eine ein-prozentige
Lohnsenkung in Deutschland hin würden deutsche MU 2.000 Arbeitsplätze in Mittel- und
Osteuropa (MOE) an der extensiven Grenze abschaffen, und insgesamt 4.000 MOE-
Arbeitsplätze abbauen. Eine entgegengesetzte ein-prozentige Lohnerhöhung in MOE geht
mit einem Aufbau von 730 Arbeitsplätzen in Deutschland einher. Die Größenordnung
dieser Reaktionen ist erheblich. Löhne in MOE liegen im Schnitt des Jahres 2000 bei etwa
zehn Prozent des deutschen Niveaus. Angenommen die geschätzten Lohnelastizitäten
blieben konstant, so würde eine Lohnerhöhung in MOE um 450 Prozent (eine Verminde-
rung des Lohnunterschieds zu Deutschland um die Hälfte) zu einem Aufbau von 330.000
(= 730 · 450) Arbeitsplätzen im deutschen verarbeitenden Gewerbe führen; das entspricht
etwa einem Viertel der geschätzten Gesamtbeschäftigung in deutschen MU-Müttern des
verarbeitenden Gewerbes. Die hypothetische Verminderung der internationalen
Lohnunterschiede ist natürlich keine politikrelevante Bewertung. Pro-Kopf-Einkommen
konvergieren zwischen Regionen mit einer Halbwertszeit von mehr als dreißig Jahren. Die
Autoren weisen abschließend auf ein künftiges Schätzverfahren hin, das bewerten wird, ob
Entlassungen in MU signifikant seltener sind als in Nicht-MU.

Margins of Multinational Labor Substitution
1 Introduction
Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are important mediators of world trade. Sur-
prisingly, however, the operation of MNEs has rarely been found to affect factor
demands across locations (e.g. Slaughter (2000) for U.S., Konings (2004) for Eu-
ropean MNEs). We quantify the effect of permanent wage differentials on MNE
employment at two critical margins. An MNE's labor demand responds to in-
ternational wage differentials at the extensive margin, when the MNE expands
into a foreign market, and at the intensive margin, when the MNE operates ex-
isting affiliates and chooses employment. Our paper thus offers an integration of
two strands of the empirical literature--one on MNEs' location choices (Devereux
and Griffith 1998, Head and Mayer 2004) and one on MNE operations across
existing locations (Slaughter 2000, Head and Ries 2002, Hanson, Mataloni and
Slaughter 2005)--into a unified estimation framework.
The MNE's two-stage decision, to first expand (extensive margin) and then
operate (intensive margin), has a well-defined econometric counterpart in sample
selection. Aside from the economic interpretation of the extensive margin, labor
demand or cost function estimates at the intensive margin are subject to selectiv-
ity bias unless corrected. Using comprehensive data on German manufacturing
MNEs and their majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates, we find that an
MNE's propensity to select a foreign location is a salient predictor of its labor de-
mand across locations and that permanent wage differentials have a strong impact
on multinational labor substitution both at the extensive and the intensive margin.
A methodological contribution of our paper is to extend the univariate sample
selection case to one of multiple selections. We derive conditions under which the

common Heckman (1979) selection correction can be applied location by location
to correct outcome estimation, in our case a seemingly unrelated equation system
of the MNE's cost function. We also prove identification of a nonparametric se-
lection model, which extends single-equation models (such as those in Das, Newey
and Vella (2003)) to the multivariate case. The nonparametric estimator is simple
to implement in a two-stage approach and is applicable to the estimation of multi-
variate demand systems in general (for a recent parametric approach to multivariate
demand see e.g. Yen (2005)).
To quantify the extensive margin, we base our parametric and non-parametric
estimators of location selection on MNE-wide profit maximization. Existing firm-
level studies on the expansion of MNEs do not find low wages or low per-capita
incomes to be significant predictors of location choice (e.g. Devereux and Griffith
(1998) for U.S., Head and Mayer (2004) for Japanese, Buch, Kleinert, Lipponer and
Toubal (2005) for German MNEs).1 Multinomial logit estimation turns wages into
significant predictors of location choice in Disdier and Mayer (2004) for French
MNEs, and in Becker, Ekholm, J¨
ackle and Muendler (2005) for Swedish MNEs
and the same German MNEs as in this paper. But multinomial logit estimation
rests on the assumption that independent agents within the MNE decide on distinct
investment projects; that is incompatible with MNE-wide profit maximization. De-
vereux and Griffith (1998) estimate multinomial logit choice and, to be consistent
with MNE-wide optimization, restrict their sample to MNEs who invest in only one
location abroad; they do not find wages to be significant predictors of U.S. MNEs'
location choices. In contrast, when we condition on an MNE's past presence and its
interaction with wages, we find wage variables to be statistically significant predic-
tors of location choices in probit and in non-parametric selection regressions. When
weighted with the impact of location selection on employment, wage differentials
across locations are substantial predictors of labor substitution within MNEs at the
extensive margin.
At the intensive margin, the world's ten largest MNEs in 2000 produce almost
one percent of world GDP, and the one hundred largest MNEs are responsible for
more than four percent of world GDP.2 Despite this apparent importance of MNEs
for international transactions, Slaughter (2000) reports that, in a sample of U.S.
1Carr, Markusen and Maskus (2001) find evidence in aggregate data that relatively abundant
high-skilled labor is a significant predictor of foreign direct investment (FDI) of U.S. MNEs (and
Blonigen, Davies and Head (2003) find that larger skill differentials predict less foreign MNE activ-
ity).

MNEs, operations in low-wage locations have no detectable impact on MNE em-
ployment in the home market. In contrast, Feenstra and Hanson (1999) attributed
about a third of U.S. relative wage changes to outsourcing (within MNEs or across
firms). Similar to Slaughter (2000), Konings (2004) and Barba Navaretti and Castel-
lani (2004) find no evidence for the hypothesis that operations of European MNEs in
low-wage locations have an impact on home-market labor demand. Braconier and
Ekholm (2000) and Marin (forthcoming) estimate wage elasticities of labor demand
and intermediate imports from Central and Eastern Europe for Western European
MNEs, and report no significant effect of foreign relative wages. Brainard and Riker
(2001), however, do find that foreign affiliate employment substitutes modestly for
U.S. parent employment but less so than for employment across foreign locations.3
Hanson et al. (2005) shift focus from factor demands to intermediate input uses and,
as an exception to most prior firm-level evidence, report that affiliates of U.S. MNEs
process significantly more intra-firm imports the lower are low-skilled wages. The
result challenges the view that relative abundance in low-skilled labor fails to attract
MNEs. We revisit their result in the context of multinational labor substitution and
extend the estimation framework to incorporate location choice. When controlling
for the propensity to select a foreign location, wages are statistically significant and
economically salient predictors of MNEs' labor demands at the intensive margin.
Our findings point to large sunk entry and exit costs so that MNE expansions (or
withdrawals) are infrequent but, when undertaken, they have a sizeable impact on
labor demand. We find cross-wage elasticities at the extensive margin to be strictly
positive. So, home and foreign employment are substitutes within MNEs not only at
the intensive but also at the extensive margin. Elasticities at the extensive margin are
about half the size of elasticities at the intensive margin in locations close to home.
For overseas developing country wages, however, elasticities are significantly dif-
ferent from zero only at the extensive margin. Bootstraps reject equality between
the intensive and the total elasticity of substitution for most locations, corroborating
the importance of the extensive margin. Elasticity point estimates at both margins
are robust across different samples and wage data, specifications, and parametric
and nonparametric estimation techniques.
We evaluate the counterfactual question how many jobs MNEs would reallocate
in response to shrinking wage differentials. A one-percent drop in German wages
relative to the sample-mean level would reduce MNE employment in Central and

Eastern Europe (CEE) by around 4,000 jobs, for instance. Similarly, a one-percent
increase in CEE wages would bring 730 jobs to Germany. These are sizeable fig-
ures. Wages in CEE are, on average, about 10 percent of the German level in 2000.
If the estimated elasticities of substitution were constant at all levels of wages, an
increase in CEE wages of 450% to cut the wage gap to Germany in half would
bring 330,000 (= 730 · 450) counterfactual manufacturing jobs to Germany--about
a quarter of the estimated home employment at German manufacturing MNEs.4 Of
course, elasticities of substitution are not constant at all levels of wages so that the
counterfactual prediction is crude. We nevertheless view the magnitude as indica-
tive of the potential importance of multinational labor substitution.
This paper has five more sections. Section 2 elaborates a model of the expan-
sion and operation of MNEs, and Section 3 derives identification conditions for
its estimation under location selectivity. Section 4 presents the data and discusses
descriptive statistics on location choice. Estimation results on multinational labor
substitution are presented in Section 5, and interpreted in counterfactual evaluations.
Section 6 concludes.

of em-
ployment predictors includes additively separable transformations of outputs, inputs
and factor prices (we discuss regressor construction below), including the prevail-
ing wage differentials between locations at time t. jt
is a disturbance term. So, the
conditional expectation of MNE j's observed employment in location is

of locations k = 1, . . . , L at time t (dk

dk

at moment t-
affects labor demand through the resulting choice of presence in location .
4If international wage gaps shrink at a similar rate as per capita GDP converges to steady state
and Germany is close to its steady state, the CEE-German wage gap would take around 35 years to
contract to half its present size (Barro and Sala i Martin 1992).

) are functions of MNE j's

takes an MNE to implement location choices (two to four years, say). The in-
formation set zj,t-

is a dis-

includes the then prevailing
wage differentials between locations.
Labor demand at the intensive margin is accordingly defined as

= E[

component of conditional labor demand E[yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
]. Economically, an
MNE's mere presence at a location typically raises the labor demand prediction
for that location.5 Statistically, the extensive margin needs to be included in the
regression to correct for selectivity.
MNE j produces a vector of location-specific outputs qjt
= (q1
jt
, . . . , qL
jt
) at L
locations. We consider MNEs to be price takers in input market, whereas they may
have market power in output markets. (We estimate a cost function, so any pricing
behavior in the sales market is consistent with our approach.) On the input side, we
focus on employment. We view MNEs as wage takers in the local markets, com-
peting with labor demand from non-tradeable goods sectors and incumbent firms.
Similarly, we consider demand for capital goods and intermediate inputs from non-
MNEs as sufficiently large so that the remaining demand of MNEs for those goods
has a negligible price impact.
Final goods prices are world-market prices that differentiated products from lo-
cations = 1, . . . , L can fetch, given product characteristics. Final goods are pro-
duced with labor and capital. After controlling for location choice in the forma-
tion of the MNE, we consider installed capital kjt

) to be a quasi-
fixed factor in an MNE's short-run cost function Cjt

k = 1, . . . , L to different degrees). We consider labor at locations k = 1, . . . , L
to be immobile across national borders and its factor prices wt
= (w1
t
, . . . , wL
t
) as
specific to L locations.
2.1 Location choice
Define N
as the fixed FDI entry costs at location and X
as the fixed FDI exit
costs from location .6 Then, fixed costs of changing presence at location in t,
anticipated at t - , become
G (djt
, dj,t-
) = N
djt
(1-dj,t-
) + X
(1-djt
)dj,t-
,
where djt
is the indicator for MNE j's current FDI presence at location , and dj,t-
for its past presence. We restrict the long-term fixed cost components N
and X
to be time invariant in our four-year MNE panel data (but control for time-varying
country and MNE characteristics in selection estimation). The decision-relevant
fixed cost difference Fj,t-
 G (1, dj,t-
) - G (0, dj,t-
) between presence at
location and absence from at time t is
Fj,t-
= N
- (X
+ N
) dj,t-
, (4)
where (X
+ N
) is sometimes called the hysteresis band and reflects the sunk cost
effect that induces firms to continue operations at location (Dixit 1989).7
To select locations ( years prior to production and sales), MNE j maximizes ex-
pected profits Ej,t-
[ p(qi=j,t
, qjt
) · qjt
- Cjt
(qjt
; kjt
, w)]. This implies that MNE
j's rule for FDI presence at location can be written as
djt
= 1 Ej,t-
[p q ,
jt
] + Ej,t-
[Cjt
(qjt
=0; ·) - Cjt
(q ,
jt
; ·)] - Fj,t-
+j,t-

) - N
+ (X
+N
) dj,t-
+ j,t-
> 0
= 1 H(zj,t-
) + j,t-
> 0 (5)
(see Appendix A for a derivation). The unknown function h(z0
j,t-
) captures both
expected revenues from producing the profit-maximizing quantity q ,
jt
at location
6For simplicity, the fixed costs of reentry into a given location after a period of absence are
assumed to be equal to the costs at first entry 
N
.
7Probit estimation with firm-fixed effects is known for problematic performance in panel data
with a short time horizon (Heckman 1981). We therefore do not attempt to estimate MNE-specific
sunk costs of presence Fj,t-
at location . We distinguish between entry and exit sunk cost com-
ponents to account for MNE-specific differences in Fj,t-
, similar to Roberts and Tybout's (1997)
model of sunk costs in exporting status.

and expected cost savings from producing at (see first line). Sunk costs of presence
at location have an observable component Fj,t-
by (4) and a disturbance j,t-
.
The disturbance j,t-
is known to the MNE but not to the researcher. To simplify
notation, we write H(zj,t-
)  h(z0
j,t-
) - N
+ (X
+N
) dj,t-
and include past
presence in any location in the information set zj,t-
.
Equation (5) is the selection equation: the empirical rule of presence in locations
= 1, . . . , L. We estimate the rule both parametrically (with a probit regression and
H(zj,t-
) = zj,t-
 ) and nonparametrically.
2.2 Multiproduct cost function
To obtain theoretically well-defined estimates of elasticities of labor substitution
across locations, we opt for a flexible parametric specification of the MNE's mul-
tiproduct cost function. We first augment the cost function with parametric correc-
tions for location selectivity. We then proceed to a model with a parametric cost
function part and a nonparametric correction for selectivity.
We use a short-run multiproduct translog cost function to estimate labor de-
mand, and extend it to control for location selectivity.8 A short-run cost function,
given MNE j's location choice, treats MNE j's vector of capital stocks kjt
as quasi-
fixed factors. We prefer a short-run over a long-run cost function because we already
control for the installation of foreign affiliates through location selectivity (5) and
because the inclusion of capital stock variables captures otherwise unobservable
(firm-specific) user costs of capital across locations.
Applying Shepard's (1953) lemma to the short-run multiproduct translog cost
function yields location-specific wage bill shares sjt
 wt
yjt
/Cjt
(the wage bill at
location in the MNE's total wage bill) as functions of (qjt
; kjt
, w). We multiply
the wage bill shares sjt
with observation-specific scalars Cjt
/wt
to arrive at our
outcome equation (labor demand at )
yjt
= xjt
 +
jt
(6)
8We follow Brown and Christensen's (1981, eq. 10.21) short-run version of Christensen, Jorgen-
son and Lau (1973) and extend the framework to multiple products. A main alternative would be
Hall's (1973) generalization of Diewert's (1971) Leontief cost function to the multiproduct case. We
favor the translog cost function because its dimensionality requirements are considerably leaner and
permit higher-order approximations to the nonparametric correction for selectivity. Kohli (1978)
took the translog specification to the empirical trade literature.

Compared to translog regression equations in wage bill shares sjt
, the transfor-
mation with observation-specific scalars Cjt
/wt
to an equivalent regression of yjt
on xjt
has three important advantages. First, there is no constant term among the
regressors xjt
so that lacking identification of the constant in a nonparametric selec-
tion correction is no concern. Second, wages are regressors only and do not enter
the dependent variable. Third, labor demand is not bounded above so that, condi-
tional on xjt
, the labor demand disturbance satisfies the assumption of a one-sided
truncation for (parametric and nonparametric) selectivity correction.
2.3 Stacking locations with zero output and factor use
Most MNEs produce in some but not in all locations. For cases of zero output or
input, however, equation (6) is not well defined. Especially zero turnover and zero
capital stocks require attention because they are MNE-specific, but absence from a
location also suggests dropping wage regressors when no employment occurs.
One possible treatment is estimation of separate equation systems for every sin-
gle presence pattern in the data. The resulting estimators are hard to interpret, how-
ever, and plagued by dimensionality: potential presence in up to L - 1 locations
outside the home location implies that there are up to 2L-1 - 1 regional presence
patterns for an MNE.9 In the German sample in 2000, for instance, only 57 out
of 1,770 MNEs are omnipresent in all four world locations while every single one
of the 15 possible regional presence pattern occurs. So, there would be 15 sets of
estimates.
We choose to stack observations of all MNEs in the sample. Stacking observa-
tions improves efficiency, collapses the up to 2L-1 - 1 sets of estimates into one
consistently estimated (L-1)-equation system, and provides a single L × L matrix
of estimates for wage elasticities of regional labor demands. Stacking is permissible
under three conditions: (i) all MNEs face identical sunk cost Fj,t-
for presence at
location conditional on their prior presence and information set (so that presence
9MNEs are present in their home location by sample definition, so only 2L-1 patterns are observ-
able in principle. Firms that only operate domestically without any foreign affiliate are not MNEs
by definition so that the single presence pattern with the only presence at the home location must be
subtracted.
8
is not correlated with inputs); (ii) MNEs face an identical short-run cost function
Cjt
(·) = C(·) in all locations of presence, conditional on their characteristics (so
that one common parameter vector is justified); and (iii) the disturbances jt
are
uncorrelated across observations.
We set all missing location variables for an absent MNE j to zero--that is log
employment, turnover, capital stock and wages are zero at location m from where
MNE j is absent. This is equivalent to interacting the translog cost function coef-
ficients with presence indicators: µ m
= 0 when no output is produced at location
m, and  m
=  m
= 0 when MNE j employs no factors at location m. Stacking
can induce correlations between the transformed regressors and the error jt
in (6).
To remove this source of potential bias, we include the set of absence indicators
(1-djt
) (with nuisance parameters 
d
) among the regressors in the outcome equa-
tion: yjt
= xjt
 = x0
jt
 + (1-djt
) 
d
. The set of absence indicators (1-djt
)
also offsets the zero output prediction at the sample mean.
3 Estimation under Location Selectivity
The selection equation (5) for location is
djt
= 1 H(zj,t-
) + j,t-
> 0
and, conditional on MNE j's selection of location , expectations of the outcome (6)
are
E yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
= xjt
 + E
jt
| d1
jt
, . . . , djt
= 1, . . . , dL
jt
; zj,t-
,
where disturbances jt
and j,t-
are uncorrelated across observations (of MNEs i
and j, and between periods t and t+1). The timing of j,t-
is not important and
the j,t-
realization could be simultaneous with jt
. Natural exclusion restrictions
on covariates that do not enter the cost function identify location selection.
In this section, we discuss cross-regional distributional assumptions on the dis-
turbances (
jt
, j,t-
) and permissible estimation techniques under those conditions.
For a parametric cost function specification (with well-defined elasticities of substi-
tution), a parametric approach to selectivity appears natural to start with. We present
sets of necessary and sufficient distributional assumptions for univariate Heckman
(1979) corrections location by location, to which we refer as parametric selectivity
correction. Empirical evidence on the necessary assumptions is favorable in our
sample. For multivariate selectivity, an extension of the Heckman (1979) estimator
9
has a complicated form (conditional moments of multivariate normal distributions
have no known closed form for multiple truncations, see Kotz, Balakrishnan and
Johnson (2000)). Simulated maximum-likelihood would be a viable technique but
requires joint multivariate normality.
To be free of distributional restrictions, we extend the parametric approach to
a nonparametric multivariate selection model (similar to one in Das et al. (2003))
and account for cross-location correlations between labor demand choices at the
extensive and intensive margins. We derive identification from common suf-
ficient assumptions. The nonparametric procedure allows for unknown distur-
bance distributions, and for unknown functional forms of E
jt
| djt
, zj,t-
and
1(H(zj,t-
) + k
j,t-
> 0).
3.1 Parametric selectivity correction
Consider Heckman (1979) selectivity corrections location by location. There are
two alternative sets of assumptions that allow for such a parametric correction,
whereby labor demand (6) in only requires correction for selectivity (5) into
but not into any other locations k = . We are interested in E yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
and H(zj,t-
) = zj,t-
 - N
+ (X
+ N
)dj,t-
.
Assumption 1 The disturbances ( k
jt
, j,t-
) are multivariate normally distributed
and independent of xm
jt
and zj,t- for all k, , m (and Var(j,t-
) = 1). In addition,
either
(a) the part of the selection shock that correlates with labor demand shocks is
an MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by location so that, condi-
tional on the MNE-specific shocks, k
jt
and jt
as well as k
j,t-
and j,t-
are
independent for k = , or
(b) the labor-demand related part of the selection shock varies by location but
is independent of labor demand shocks in other locations ( k
jt
and j,t-
are
independent for k = ),
for , k = 1, . . . , L.
Especially case (a), where the part of the selection shock j,t-
that correlates
with labor demand shocks k
jt
is an MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by
location, is plausible in economic terms. Suppose selection disturbances include
both host country-specific parts such as, for example, surprising changes to profit
repatriation policies and include MNE-specific parts such as shocks to its sunk entry
costs. Changes to host country repatriation policies affect the entry decision. But
10
once the MNE operates in the host country, it minimizes costs irrespective of entry-
relevant host-country shocks so that cost function disturbances are unrelated to the
entry-relevant policy shocks. In case (a), all relevant information for labor demand
at any location is fully contained in the single indicator djt
(which is as informative
about j,t-
as any other location indicator). Case (b) is more restrictive and implies
that neither MNE-specific nor host-country specific shocks to presence at location
have a bearing on labor demand at other locations k = .
Note that cross-location correlations of labor demand shocks are not necessarily
evidence against Assumption 1. As the proof to Proposition 1 will show, case (a) of
MNE-specific selection shocks induces a correlation between labor demand shocks
across locations: k
jt
and j,t-
correlate across locations k = but in the same way
as jt
and j,t-
.
Proposition 1 Independent parametric selection correction for L locations identify
xjt
 and Cov(
jt
, j,t-
) if and only if Assumption 1 holds.
Proof. Because any normally distributed variable can be linearly decomposed into
a sum of independent standard normal variables, consider without loss of generality

[0, 1] is a weight to satisfy (
)2 =

, k , k are parameters. To
prove sufficiency, let k

= k = 0 for k = .
First consider (a) MNE-specific selection shocks j,t-
whose labor demand
related part does not vary over locations. Concretely, set ek
jt
= ejt
for all locations
k, and denote · 
k
k . Then the variances and covariances of the selection
shocks (7) are 
= 1 and k

= 1-. The variances and covariances of the labor
demand shocks (8) are  = (· )2 + ( )2 and k = (· )2. And the covariances
between the selection shock in location k and the demand shock in location are
k

= · .
Second, consider (b) location-varying selection shocks j,t-
that are indepen-
dent of labor demand shocks in other locations. Concretely, set k = 0 for k = ,
and denote ·   for comparability. Then the selection shock variances and
covariances are 
= 1 and k

= 0. The variances and covariances of the la-
bor demand shocks are  = (· )2 + ( )2 and k = 0. The covariances be-
tween the selection shock in location k and the demand shock in location are

=

1- · and k

= 0 for k = .
11
In both cases, the marginal likelihood function becomes
g(yjt

) =
 (yjt

 )/

 )

after concentrating out ujt
and vjt
, where  =  and 
= 
/ , and (·)
and (·) are the standard normal density and distribution functions. This is pre-
cisely the likelihood function for independent Heckman (1979) correction location
by location.
For necessity, observe that parameters k

= 0 or k = 0 for any k = cause
cross-equation correlations and do not permit concentrating out ujt
and vjt
to arrive
at (9). Similarly, k = 0 for any k = precludes concentrating out ejt
to arrive
at (9).
3.1.1 Estimation
Extending the parametric two-stage procedure to L locations, we first estimate equa-
tions (5) with probit regressions by location. Second, we estimate outcome (6) at
location by including the predicted selectivity hazard (inverse of the Mills ratio)
^

jt
from the first stage among the regressors (we also include absence indicators
(1-djt
) among the regressors to prevent stacking bias). The coefficient on the
predicted selectivity hazard equals 
  
 . We implement the second-stage
estimation of (6) for L-1 locations (excluding home) by iterating Zellner's (1962)
seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) over the estimated disturbance covariance
matrix until the estimates converge. This is equivalent to maximum-likelihood es-
timation (Dhrymes 1971) and makes estimation invariant to the deleted location
equation L (Barten 1969). Through constraints, we impose linear homogeneity in
factor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients (see appendix B). We treat induced
heteroskedasticity following Heckman (1979) (resulting in differing standard errors
on symmetric coefficients). After estimation, we test whether either of the two pos-
sible sets of distributional assumptions are satisfied. We will find implications of
set (b) violated but fail to find evidence against (a).
3.1.2 Tests
Implications of Assumption 1 are testable. In case (a) of MNE-specific selection
shocks and for any  < 1, Assumption 1 implies that k

is the same for any pair of
locations k = . Note that we have no evidence on k

for k = from location-by-
12
location estimation. We obtain estimates of k

from multivariate probit estimation
instead and use a 2-test for their equality.
Under the additional assumption that  = 0, there is a further test to query
case (a), whether selection shocks are purely MNE-specific. Probit (maximum
likelihood) estimation of selection in the Heckman procedure does not predict the
disturbances jt
. A testable implication of an MNE-specific selection shock, how-
ever, is that, if an MNE is neither present in all locations nor absent from all lo-
cations, the choices of presence and absence must be consistent with a location-
independent MNE-specific selection shock for all locations. Concretely, an MNE
observation contradicts the assumption of a location-independent selection shock
if zj,t-
k - Fk
j,t-
> zj,t-
 - Fj,t-
for locations k of absence and locations
of presence because jt
can be subtracted from both sides of the inequalities. This
implication is testable for the predicted values, which are normally distributed con-
ditional on zj,t-
and dj,t-
by normality of jt
.
For (b) location-variant selection shocks, the set of assumptions implies that
k = 0. So, a regression of jt
on 1
jt
, . . . , -1
jt
, +1
jt
, . . . , L
jt
must have zero coeffi-
cients. We test this implication.
Both sets (a) and (b) of assumptions imply that k
jt
is independent of dk
jt
for
all k because k
jt
and j,t-
are independent. We include absence indicators (1-
djt
) among the regressors in the outcome equation, however, so this is not a useful
implication in our context.
3.2 Nonparametric selectivity correction
In the nonparametric version of the multivariate binary choice model (5) and (6),
djt
= 1 H(zj,t-
) + j,t-
> 0 , ( = 1, . . . , L)
E yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
= xjt
 + E
jt
djt
= 1, dk=
jt
; zj,t-
,
no distributional assumptions are placed on j,t-
or jt
and H(·) is an unknown
function.
We augment the nonparametric sample selection model in Das et al. (2003) to
remain identified under multivariate binary selection (similar in spirit to a selection
model with endogeneity in Das et al. (2003)). Suppose k
j,t-
and jt
are correlated.
Suppose also that zj,t-
and xjt
are correlated (e.g. wages in the past and present, as
our data show). Because dk
jt
is a function of k
j,t-
, it correlates with jt
; because dk
jt
is a function of zj,t-
, it correlates with xjt
. So, if the labor demand equation does
13
not condition on dk
jt
, the identifying restriction that xjt
and yjt
are uncorrelated will
be violated.
Define the propensity score (the expected probability of selection conditional on
zj,t-
) as pjt
 E[djt
| zj,t-
] = 1-G(-H(zj,t-
)), where G(·) is the cumulative
distribution function of j,t-
. Then, assuming G(·) is one-to-one and changing
variables with ujt
= 1-G(j,t-
), labor demand at the extensive margin becomes
E[
jt
| djt
= 1, dk=
jt
, zj,t-
] = E[
jt
| j,t-
> -H(·); dk=
jt
, zj,t-
]
= E[
jt
| ujt
< pjt
; dk=
jt
]
=
pjt
0
jt
f(
jt
, ujt
|dk=
jt
) d jt
dujt
/pjt
= m pjt
, dk=
jt
.
So, the conditional labor demand disturbance for location depends only on the
propensity score for that location and the pattern of presence elsewhere. Observed
labor demand then satisfies
E yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
= xjt
 + m pjt
, dk=
jt
.
To establish identification, consider deviations from the truth  (xjt
) 
xjt
(^
 -  ) and m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)  ^
m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) - m (pjt
, dk=
jt
), where hats de-
note estimates of the true (not hatted) functions. Assumption 2 states sufficient
conditions for identification.
Assumption 2
(i) E[
jt
| djt
= 1, dk=
jt
, zj,t-
] = m (pjt
, dk=
jt
),
(ii) Pr( (xjt
)+m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) = 0|djt
= 1) = 1 implies that  (xjt
) is con-
stant,
(iii) zj,t-
pjt
= 0 with probability one,
for = 1, . . . , L.
Part (i) requires, as in the parametric case, that the conditional expectation of
the labor demand disturbance at location is only a function of the propensity score
of presence at and observed presence elsewhere. So, in the regression of observed
labor demand yjt
on xjt
 and m (pjt
, dk=
jt
), xjt
 is a separate additive compo-
nent. This specification extends nonparametric selectivity correction in Das et al.
(2003) to the multivariate case.
14
Part (ii) is the same identification condition as in Das et al. (2003) and implies
that pjt
(which enters m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)) depends on variables in zj,t-
that are not in
xjt
 . Otherwise, a regression of yjt
on xjt
 leaves  (xjt
) = m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)
and m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) = -m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) indeterminate--a violation of (ii). In our
context, the exclusion restriction arises naturally because the MNE chooses xjt
in
response to information after t - , whereas the decision of presence is based on
zj,t-
. In addition, parent-firm characteristics and competitor-level host-country
characteristics are predictors of presence but not related to the labor-cost specific
part of the cost function other than through wages themselves. The rank condi-
tion (iii) requires that the information set zj,t-
predicts the propensity score.
Assumption 2 allows us to relax the earlier identifying assumption that the dis-
turbance tupel ( k
jt
, j,t-
) is independent of xm
jt
and zj,t-
for all k, , m. Assump-
tion 2 only requires that, conditional on the propensity score pjt
, jt
is uncorrelated
with all functions of xjt
and zj,t-
. Moreover, the nonparametric estimator xm
jt
al-
lows for conditional heteroskedasticity of unknown form (and thus presents a non-
parametric alternative to Chen and Khan's (2003) three-step estimator). Also note
that we need no assumption on the cross-equation correlation of j,t-
if we include
dk=
jt
. This makes nonparametric analysis a powerful tool for multivariate binary
selection estimation.
Proposition 2 If Assumption 2 holds and if m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) and pjt
(zj,t-
) are contin-
uously differentiable and have continuous distribution functions almost everywhere,
then xjt
 and m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) are identified up to additive constants.
Proof. In any observationally equivalent model it must be the case that the observed
outcome satisfies E[yjt
| xjt
, djt
, zj,t-
] = xjt
^
 + ^
m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) for some xjt
^
 and
^
m (pjt
, dk=
jt
). Equivalently, deviations from the truth  (xjt
)+m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) =
0. This identity must be differentiable with respect to xjt
and zj,t-
by continuous
differentiability of m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) and pjt
(zj,t-
). So,
x
jt
 (xjt
) = 0,
(m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)/pjt
) · zj,t-
pjt
= 0.
The first equation implies that  (xjt
) = xjt
(^
 -  ) = c1 for a constant c1
and xjt
 is identified up to this constant. By zj,t-
pjt
= 0, the second equation
implies that m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) = ^
m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) - m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) = c2 for a constant c2
and m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) is identified up to that constant.
Note that lacking identification of additive constants is not a problem in our con-
text. The transformed cost function regressors xjt
 in equation (6) do not include
15
a constant term. To assess the labor demand effect of permanent wage differentials
at the extensive margin, we will evaluate 
pjt
m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)·zj,t-
pjt
(a scalar), for
which the constant does not matter.
Conversely, if we want to include the propensity scores pk=
jt
in the second-stage
regression, instead of the presence indicators dk=
jt
, we can only do so if j,t-
and
k
jt
are uncorrelated across locations (k = ). This is a drawback of identification
under Assumption 2.
Suppose we are interested in a broader definition of the extensive margin,
¯
yext,
jt
 E
jt
| djt
= 1; zj,t-
,
which does not condition on the observed location pattern outside . This defini-
tion allows us to investigate the impact of a permanent wage differential (in zj,t-
)
through its effect on the entire grid of an MNE's potential locations. Formally,
we can now evaluate pjt
m (pjt
) · zj,t-
pjt
(a matrix), where pjt
is the vector
of propensity scores. Under the restriction that j,t-
and k
jt
are not correlated
across locations (k = ), dk
jt
is not correlated with k
jt
because jt
must be uncor-
related with all functions of zj,t-
. Then we can relax item (i) in Assumption 2 to
E[
jt
| djt
= 1, zj,t-
] = m (pjt
).
Assumption 3
(i) E[
jt
| djt
= 1, zj,t-
] = m (pjt
) and Cov(
jt
, k
j,t-
) = 0 for k = ,
(ii) Pr( (xjt
)+m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) = 0|djt
= 1) = 1 implies that  (xjt
) is con-
stant,
(iii) zj,t-
pjt
= 0 with probability one,
for = 1, . . . , L.
Proposition 3 follows as a corollary to Proposition 2 (replace the scalar deriva-
tive m (pjt
, dk=
jt
)/pjt
with the vector pjt
m (pjt
), and zj,t-
pjt
with
zj,t-
pjt
).
Proposition 3 If Assumption 3 holds and if m (pjt
) and pjt
(zj,t-
) are continu-
ously differentiable and have continuous distribution functions almost everywhere,
then xjt
 and m (pjt
) are identified up to additive constants.
Das et al. (2003) establish convergence rates and asymptotic normality of similar
estimators on the basis of smoothness properties of pjt
(zj,t-
) and m (pjt
) (and
a generalization of xjt
 to a function of xjt
) for splines and power series. We
16
use power series to approximate pjt
(zj,t-
) and m (pjt
). Power series are root-
n asymptotic normal and can estimate smooth functionals of unknown parameters
(Newey 1997). Most important for our application, the first derivative of the power
series estimator is a smooth functional and hence also root-n asymptotic normal.
3.2.1 Estimation
We first estimate equations (5) with individual linear regressions by location. We
use a third-order polynomial in wages and two additional predictors, alongside oth-
erwise linear predictors (to break the curse of dimensionality). Second, we include
the predicted propensity scores ^
pjt
from the first stage on the second stage (6). Un-
der Assumption 2 we approximate m (pjt
, dk=
jt
) with a third-order polynomial in
pjt
, interacted with dk=
jt
(we continue to include absence indicators (1-djt
) without
interactions to both approximate m (·) and remove potential stacking bias). Under
Assumption 3 we approximate m (pjt
) with a third-order polynomial in pjt
(and in-
clude absence indicators (1-djt
) among the regressors to remove potential stacking
bias). We implement the second-stage estimation of (6) for L-1 locations (exclud-
ing home) by iterating SUR over the estimated disturbance covariance matrix until
the estimates converge. Through constraints, we impose linear homogeneity in fac-
tor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients (see appendix B).
3.3 Wage Elasticities of Labor Demand
We use elasticities of substitution to quantify the responses of multinational labor
demand yjt
to permanent wage changes. The (constant-output) cross-price elasticity
of substitution between factors and k is defined as  k
  ln yjt
/ ln wk and
becomes
T
k
=
 k
+ s sk
s
(k = ) and T =
 + s (s - 1)
s
(10)
for a short-run translog cost function, where s = w y /C is the wage bill share
of the workforce at (the wage bill at location in the MNE's total wage bill) and
 k
 sjt
/ ln wk is the marginal change of the wage bill share at in response
to a log wage change at k. These elasticities can be calculated both for each in-
dividual MNE-j observation and in the aggregate using sample means. We will
report elasticity estimates from cost function coefficients and observed mean wage
bill shares.
A permanent change of the wage level wk in location k is reflected in both
vectors of regressors xjt
(with wk
t
) and zj,t-
(with wk
t-
). So, the response of the
17
wage bill share sjt
to a permanent change in ln wk

is

are
the marginal effects on the third-order polynomials, evaluated at the sample mean.10
We run 200 bootstraps on the two-stage procedure to find standard errors for our
elasticity estimates. Bootstrapping is advantageous because it does not require treat-
ment of insignificant wage coefficients from the first-stage regressions in our quan-
tification of the extensive margin. Moreover, Eakin, McMillen and Buono (1990)
show in simulations that analytic confidence intervals for elasticity estimates un-
der normality assumptions can widely differ from bootstrapped confidence interval
estimates.
10If wt

drops
from a binary probit likelihood function. By our variable construction, wt
is MNE j's competitors'
mean factor price exposure. It is thus also MNE-specific.

4 Data and Descriptive Statistics
Our main data source is a confidential three-dimensional panel (parent-affiliate-
year observations) of German MNEs at Deutsche Bundesbank (BuBa). We re-
tain manufacturing parents and majority-owned manufacturing affiliates only. We
transform the data to parent-location-year observations and combine the data with
complementary information on wages and host-country characteristics from various
sources.
4.1 Firm-level data
Information on foreign affiliates' turnover, employment and fixed assets stems from
BuBa's MIDI database (MIcro database Direct Investment, formerly DIREK). MIDI
contains outward FDI information from a legally mandated annual survey, which
covers the universe of German firms and households with foreign corporate holdings
above minimum ownership shares and capital stock thresholds (Lipponer 2003). In-
dividually identified outward FDI data are available for the years 1996-2001 and
provide two-digit NACE 1.1 sector classifications for the parent and affiliates. We
restrict our sample to majority-owned foreign affiliates because estimation of a mul-
tilocation cost function suggests the use of observations of parent firms with full
managerial control and because majority ownership is insensitive to a change in the
notification threshold in MIDI 1999. Assets and capital structure of every majority-
owned foreign firm are reported in MIDI, including in years with zero turnover.
Turnover does not distinguish within-MNE shipments from final sales but is never-
theless a proxy to affiliate production for cost function estimation.
Balance sheet and income statement information for German parent firms comes
from BuBa's USTAN database, which records this information for German firms
that draw a bill of exchange (for a documentation in English see Deutsche Bun-
desbank (1998)). The bill of exchange is a common form of payment among firms
of all sizes throughout the sample period 1996-2001 (though losing some popular-
ity thereafter), and USTAN is considered the most comprehensive source of balance
sheet data for companies of all sizes outside the financial sector in Germany. The
MIDI and USTAN data were linked by parent name and address in previous work
(Becker et al. 2005), resulting in the loss of some observations from the universe.11
11Our conservative string matching routine filtered out potential duplicates from time-varying firm
identifiers in USTAN. In manual treatments, only doubtlessly identifiable parent pairs from MIDI and
USTAN were kept. At the expense of reduced sample size, this caution guarantees the formation of
time-consistent parent pairs.

aPredicted German employment at in- and out-of-sample MNEs, based on linear employment
regressions to account for incomplete MIDI-USTAN matches.
To obtain interpretable results, we lump host countries into four aggregate lo-
cations: CEE (Central and Eastern Europe), DEV (Developing countries), OIN
(Overseas Industrialized countries), and WEU (Western Europe); see table 15 in
the Appendix for definitions. As Table 1 shows, the four aggregate foreign lo-
cations host similarly large manufacturing workforces for German manufacturing
MNEs: between 250,000 and 400,000 employees. Aggregation into four foreign
locations beyond home reduces the estimated cross-wage labor demand elasticity
matrix to five columns and rows (with 25 elasticity estimates). Except for possibly
DEV, which spans Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region (except Japan, Aus-
tralia and New Zealand), aggregate locations are fairly homogeneous. Among the
low-wage locations we focus on CEE, where most expansions happen. Among the
2,247 MIDI MNEs with foreign presence either in 1996 or 2000, CEE was the re-
gion where MNEs opened most new affiliates, 18.2 percent more in 2000 than in
1996, followed by DEV with 12.6 percent, OIN with 3.2 percent and WEU with 2.0
percent.
MIDI and USTAN matches are incomplete so that we do not observe parent em-
ployment for every German MNE. For comparisons, we predict total parent employ-
ment for the full sample of German manufacturing MNEs from a linear regression
of parent employment on foreign employments and estimate that German manufac-
turing MNEs with majority-owned foreign manufacturing affiliates employ about
1.4 million German workers. Conditional on MNE presence, the largest employ-
ment per sample MNE occurs in OIN and the smallest employment in WEU.
Table 2 shows changes to the presence patterns of German MNEs between 1996
and 2000. Adjustments are infrequent. Among firms who remain MNEs in both
years, more than four in five with a presence in only one location abroad in 1996
keep exactly one foreign location (large numbers in row 2; large numbers sum to

100 percent for location counts 2 through 5). More than half of all MNEs who are
present in only one foreign location in 1996 have a presence in only one foreign
location in 2000 (small numbers in row 2; small numbers sum to 100 percent for
location counts 1 through 5). In general, entries along the diagonal exhibit the
highest frequency in every row and every column. Regional expansions are gradual:
the frequencies above the diagonal decrease monotonically in every row. Regional
exits, however, are not gradual: MNEs who exit most frequently abandon all foreign
locations at once; frequencies in the first column dominate frequencies below the
diagonal in every row (small numbers in column 1). There is a large number of
complete withdrawals between 1996 and 2000 (477 out of 2,247 MNEs). Note
that the MIDI data cover the universe of German firms with FDI above minimum
thresholds, and sample attrition is mitigated by the legal obligation to report and
Deutsche Bundesbank's commitment to follow up on missing questionnaires.
German MNEs typically pursue a single-affiliate strategy of foreign expansions:
the median number of affiliates of a German MNE per location is one. Table 3 shows
that, once an MNE has established its presence in a given location with at least one
affiliate, the number of affiliates hardly changes: 859 out of 1,259 observations of
MNEs in given locations exhibit no change to the number of affiliates between 1996

and 2000; 247 out of 1,259 observations of MNEs in their locations increase or de-
crease the number of affiliates by one. A small remainder of 153 manufacturing
parents chooses to change the number of affiliates by more. (The MNE total in Ta-
ble 3 is smaller than that in Table 2 because we condition on presence in a location.)
Together, the infrequent changes to foreign presence in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that
MNEs face potentially large sunk costs of foreign presence.
Changes to the number of host countries within locations are even more infre-
quent than changes to the number of affiliates: an analysis of host country changes
similar to Table 3 shows that 947 out of 1,259 observations of MNEs in given loca-
tions exhibit no change in the number of selected host countries within the location.
Infrequent net changes to the number of affiliates and countries could, in principle,
conceal gross changes such as changes to the country composition within a location
or exit and reentry with a different affiliate. Yet only small fractions of MNEs who
maintain a constant number of affiliates within a location change countries in the
location. In both CEE and WEU 4.2 percent of MNEs with constant affiliate num-
bers between 1996 and 2000 change country, and 7.2 percent of the MNEs with
constant affiliate numbers in DEV change country, but none do so in OIN. Simi-
larly small fractions are associated with changing affiliate IDs, suggesting that the
22
few gross changes beyond net changes are mostly country changes and not reentries
with different affiliates. Motivated by these findings, we define the extensive margin
(selection into a location) as the presence of an MNE in an aggregate location with
at least one affiliate. We do not distinguish the few country changes within aggre-
gate locations for selection estimation, but our labor demand (outcome) estimation
accounts for varying country-level exposures.
We deflate parent variables with the German CPI and deflate affiliate variables
with country-level CPIs (from the IMF's International Financial Statistics). CPI de-
flation factors are re-based to unity at year end 1998. We transform foreign currency
values to their EUR equivalents in December 1998 in order to remove nominal ex-
change rate fluctuations. December 1998 is the mid point in time for our 1996-2001
sample. Introduction of the euro in early 1999 makes December 1998 a natural
reference date. See Appendix C for details on currency conversion.
4.2 Complementary data
Wage information is not reported in MIDI. We obtain manufacturing wages by coun-
try and sector for 1996 through 2001 from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database
at the 3-digit ISIC level (dividing sectoral wage bills by employment). To mitigate
possible workforce composition effects in our labor demand regression on wages,
we use medians over sectors by foreign country. Though German wages are avail-
able from USTAN, we also take the German wages from UNIDO for comparability;
we use sector wages for location selection estimation (where workforce compo-
sition behind labor cost measures is not an econometric concern) and Germany-
wide sector medians for translog estimation. We conduct robustness checks using
OWW wage data by occupation (Occupational Wages around the World, Freeman
and Oostendorp 2001) between 1983 and 1999 and using UBS wage data for 1994,
1997, 2000 and 2003. We also obtain sector-specific German wages from the origi-
nal data that underly the OWW information for Germany. We deflate and currency-
convert the wages in accordance with all other variables, and transform them into
annual wages. Appendix D provides further details on wage variable construction.
National accounts information for host-country regressors comes from the
World Bank's World Development Indicators and the IMF's International Finan-
cial Statistics. We use CEPII bilateral trade and geographic data (www.cepii.fr) to
compute market access to a host country as in Redding and Venables (2004), see
Appendix E. To condition selection estimation on skill endowments beyond labor
costs, we include the host country's percentage of high-school or higher educated

Table 4 shows means of variables by location in the censored panel (of MNEs
with presence in at least one foreign location for labor demand estimation). In
our main specifications, we consider multinational labor demand during the years
1998-2001 (called t) for a sample of 1,640 MNEs and infer their location selection
two years prior to production (t - ) from an uncensored sample of 3,392 MNEs.
For robustness checks, we also use a single cross-section of 322 MNEs in 2000
and their location selection in 1996. The frequency of MNE presence abroad in-
12For estimation of location selection, we also experimented with German import and export data
from 2000 as controls for trade in the MNE's home sector. The import and export data were at the
two-digit product level (matching NACE 1.1 two-digit sector codes) and by country of destination or
origin (Fachserie 7, Reihe 7 from destatis.de/genesis) but did not prove to be significant predictors
of location selection.
24
creased by two to four percentage points between 1996-99 and 1998-2001 in all
locations but WEU (Western European countries) where it slightly fell in the cen-
sored panel. German MNEs spend the bulk of their wage bill (79 percent) at home.
From German MNEs, CEE receives labor expenditures beyond the remaining de-
veloping world combined. (Note that shares do not add to unity across columns
because averages are conditional on presence, omitting absent MNEs). A similar
cross-location pattern arises for turnover and capital stocks.
Substantial wage disparities persist across locations. Between Germany and
CEE, for instance, MNE wages differ by 2.1 log points, or a factor of around 800
percent (exp{10.360 - 8.286} = 8.0 for 1998-2001). This MNE-level difference
is smaller, however, than the country-population weighted wage gap of about 1,000
percent (1/.099) in the raw UNIDO wage data in 2000. The smaller conditional
differential could reflect MNE selection into relative high-wage countries within
the low-wage region CEE.
Choice-specific variables (host country attributes) are not identified in binomial
choice models such as probit for parametric selection correction. We estimate our
model also in an MNE cross-section where we have no time-varying host country
attributes. We therefore transform host country attributes to competitor-averages
by MNE, and use competitor-average transformations in all procedures for com-
parability. We group MNEs into eight manufacturing sectors13 and calculate mean
host-country attributes over all competitor observations by location and sector. We
take the total of competitors' foreign employments as host-country weights within
the location. The wage at t -  in CEE, for example, is the average wage paid
at competitor's affiliates in CEE. In Table 4, we only take means over MNEs with
presence in a given location so that the table reports CEE wages of the competitors
of a German MNE with FDI in CEE.14 German MNEs in CEE, compared to any
other location, face competitors in host countries that offer the least market access,
that have the smallest skill endowments, that are geographically the closest and that
exhibit the smallest per-capita consumption. The CEE wages paid by competitors
of MNEs in CEE are below those paid by competitors in DEV. MNEs in OIN face
competitors with the strongest host-country market access and host-country skill
endowments.
13The sectors are: food; textiles and leather; wood, pulp and paper; chemicals, rubber, plastic
and energy producing materials; mineral and metal products; machinery and equipment; transport
equipment; manufactures not elsewhere classified.
14We use the wage level at t- as a regressor in selection estimation, not its log. For comparisons
to the the log wage at t, we report the log of the sample-mean wage at t -  in Table 4.
25
Parent-level covariates are suggestive of selectivity effects at their means. Par-
ents with headquarters in East Germany (including West Berlin) are slightly more
likely to expand to CEE and OIN than the average German MNE. For all other
parent-firm regressors, regional conditional means (columns 2 to 5) exceed the un-
conditional mean (column 1), and regional means tend to be the lower the higher the
frequency of MNE presence. Conditional on their presence abroad, MNEs exhibit
larger home workforces, larger parent-firm equity or debt, and higher parent-firm
capital-labor ratios.
5 Estimation
A permanent wage differential between an MNE's home and a foreign location di-
rectly affects employment at the intensive margin through labor reallocation across
existing affiliates. A permanent wage differential indirectly affects labor demand at
the extensive margin by altering the likelihood of presence, which in turn changes
conditional expectations of labor demand. We estimate both margins.
The effect of home wages on employment is identifiable at both margins from
sector variation in a cross-section of German MNEs because individual wage-taking
firms face bargained earnings schedules from sectoral agreements between unions
and employers' associations (with one-year to two-year terms).15 Time variation
of home wages provides additional identification. Similarly, both time variation
and variation across locations identify employment effects of foreign wages at the
intensive margin. Identification of foreign wages at the extensive margin is more
limited, however. Because binomial choice models (of presence or absence) cannot
identify coefficients of choice-specific variables (host country attributes), foreign
wage changes at the extensive margin are mainly identified over time. We obtain
additional variation by considering competitor-average foreign wages which vary
by MNE. To clear wage variables of workforce composition effects, we use country-
wide sector medians for foreign wages. For German wages, we use sector medians
in outcome (translog) estimation but sector wages in location selection estimation
(where composition effects in wages are not a concern). Estimation at the intensive
margin conditions on a firm's MNE status.
15The use of sector home wages and location selectivity controls removes potential firm-level
bargaining effects behind labor demand coefficients on home wages. Foreign affiliates of German
MNEs are few and small, with arguably no impact on foreign wage levels.

5.1 Location choice
We estimate binomial choices of presence in up to four foreign locations--CEE,
DEV, OIN and WEU--with probit regressions for parametric selectivity correction
(Assumption 1) and with series estimators of selection propensities for nonparamet-
ric correction (Assumptions 2 or 3).
5.1.1 Probit estimation
To have a first idea of sunk costs in location choice, Table 5 shows probit probabil-
ity estimates from a short regression of MNE presence on past presence indicators
across locations and a constant. Past presence between 1996 and 1999 at a given
location is a highly significant predictor of MNE presence two years later in that lo-
cation (and continues to be highly significant in a long regression). MNE presence
indicators elsewhere serve as rudimentary controls. We consider this regression a
reduced-form version of the empirical presence rule (5); long regressions that un-
derpin location selection with additional economic regressions will corroborate the
sunk cost implication that past presence predicts about 70 percent of the propensity
of future presence.
The reduced-form estimates provide a summary view of sunk costs in probabil-
ity terms. Recall that the sunk cost part of location selection (5) can be represented

the hysteresis band. Table 6 shows the decomposition result, based on estimates of
coefficients along the diagonal and the constant in Table 5. For the entry and exit
cost decomposition involves the estimate of the constant, entry and exit costs cannot
be expressed in marginal probability terms of their own. A marginal probability
measure can be inferred for their sum, the hysteresis band.
Past presence increases the likelihood of future presence in a given location by
more than seventy percent in all but WEU, where the marginal effect predicts a more
than sixty percent increase. Long probit regressions confirm these magnitudes. The
total, however, hides the differential impact of entry and exit costs. Entry costs
are the largest in the distant low-income and high-income locations DEV and OIN,
and dominate exit costs there. Conversely, entry costs are the lowest in the nearby
low-income and high-income locations CEE and WEU, and significantly smaller
than exit costs. Among the exit costs are the opportunity costs of absence. German
MNEs are considerably less reluctant to leave distant locations DEV and OIN than
they abandon the neighboring locations CEE or WEU.
Indicators for past FDI presence may not exclusively capture sunk costs but
also firm heterogeneity. In long regressions, we look into the black box behind
rule (5) and include firm-level predictors as well as competitor-average host country

attributes. Table 7 presents the marginal effects for the full list of covariates.16
Among the firm-level predictors, we include interactions between past presence
indicators and wages to capture the co-determining effect of wage differentials and
an MNE's past presence at a location.
In the long regressions of Table 7, past presence elsewhere (off the diagonal)
loses predictive power. But past presence for the region itself continues to be a
statistically significant and salient predictor of presence (excepting OIN because of
the wage interaction). When leaving interactions between wages and past presence
out for a comparison, past presence at the same location has a highly statistically
significant probability effect of .779 (standard error .022) in CEE, .671 (.027) in
DEV, .713 (.026) in OIN, and .747 (.020) in WEU--similar to the marginal effects
in the short regression (last row in Table 6). These probability effects of past pres-
ence confirm the importance of the hysteresis band. The MNE's number of host
countries in the past also significantly raises the likelihood of presence. German
MNEs with large home employment, low parent debt, and a high capital-labor ratio
at the parent firm are significantly more likely to be present at most or all foreign
locations within two years.
Time and, by construction, competitor variation identifies wage effects. The
home wage has the expected positive sign in all regressions and is a significant pre-
dictor for presence in OIN and WEU, both by itself and in its interaction with past
presence. The negative coefficients on the home wage interaction with past pres-
ence suggest that wage differentials matter less for the location decision of MNEs
that already own an affiliate in the region. With German wages partly controlling
for the wage differential between the foreign location and the home sector, several
foreign wages are statistically insignificant predictors of location choice. Insignifi-
cant coefficients of host wages are common in the literature on location choice (e.g.
Devereux and Griffith (1998) for U.S., Head and Mayer (2004) for Japanese, and
Buch et al. (2005) for German MNEs). For estimation of the cross-elasticity of la-
bor demand at the extensive margin, however, only the coefficient on the German
wage matters (because the extensive margin is only defined for foreign labor de-
mand). Bootstraps over both estimation stages will show even for the statistically
weak wage prediction of location selection into CEE that, weighted with the strong

labor demand effects of CEE selection, home wage levels significantly affect the
elasticities of labor substitution at the extensive margin.
Further covariates (not reported) include competitors' wages in OIN and WEU
and their interactions with past presence in DEEV and WEU, competitors' hosts'
market access, competitors' hosts' skill shares, competitors' hosts' distance, com-
petitors' hosts' per-capita consumption, an indicator of parents' headquarters in
West Germany, equity, and parent profits/equity. None of those covariates is sig-
nificant at the five-percent level in any location. To tentatively control for an out-
side margin of arm's length trade between independent firms, we also included a
set of sector and location specific import and export measures but found the trade
variables not to be significant predictors of location choice; here we leave them out.
5.1.2 Nonparametric propensity score estimation
We estimate the propensity score of location choice with a third-order polynomial
in wages, market access, and the count of an MNE's past host countries, alongside
the same linear predictors as for probit estimation. The predicted propensity scores
are .338 for CEE, .291 for DEV, .262 for OIN and .617 for WEU--slightly under-
predicting the actual frequencies of presence in Table 4 but reflecting the relative
frequencies across locations.
Table 8 reports coefficient estimates by location. Marginal effects are close
to those in the probit regressions. Estimates of the hysteresis band along the di-
agonal of past presence indicators continue to have a magnitude similar to probit
estimation. When leaving interactions between wages and past presence out, past
presence at the same location has a highly statistically significant probability effect
of .759 (standard error .018) in CEE, .668 (.020) in DEV, .711 (.017) in OIN, and
.707 (.024) in WEU--again close to the marginal effects in the short regression
(last row in Table 6). Inclusion of wage interactions with past presence shifts much
predictive power to the interaction terms in DEV and all predictive power to the
interaction terms in OIN. In WEU, the wage-presence interaction countervails the
high marginal effects of past presence.
We present F-tests of joint significance of individual wages for p values at or
below the .1 threshold. Similar to probit estimation, polynomial terms that involve
home wages predict location choice more successfully than most foreign wages
(except OIN wages). Home wages are the important predictors for cross-elasticities
of labor substitution at the extensive margin. Using UNIDO wages, series terms
involving the home sector wage predict selection into DEV and OIN at the five

Significant parent-level covariates from probit remain significant predictors un-

insignificant parent-level covariates remain insignificant.
5.2 Translog estimation with selectivity correction
We proceed to estimation of the short-run translog cost function and include pre-
dicted selection hazards from probit estimation as regressors in the equation system
(parametric selectivity correction, Assumption 1). Alternatively, we include pre-
dicted propensity scores from nonparametric selection estimation (Assumptions 2
or 3).
5.2.1 Translog cost function estimation
Table 9 presents estimates of translog cost function equations for 1,640 stacked
MNE observations between 1998 and 2001. (We lose observations mainly because
of missing wage information at affiliate locations.) Coefficient estimates are from
iterated seemingly unrelated regressions of transformed wage bill shares on their
translog predictors for four out of five locations, excluding home. For the regres-
sion, wage bill shares and covariates are scaled by observation-specific cost-wage
ratios to remove upper truncation. Beyond the reported wage coefficients, the equa-
tions include the full sets of turnover and fixed asset regressors, the scaled equivalent
of the constant, and indicators of absence from all other locations. All but two wage
coefficients in Table 9 are significantly different from zero at the one percent level,
and all coefficients but one are significant at the five percent level in each, paramet-
ric and nonparametric, regression. Most coefficients on output and fixed assets (not
reported) are similarly highly significant.
Equation estimates in the upper panel of Table 9 include the predicted selectivity
hazards (inverses of Mills ratios) by location (Assumption 1). Selectivity hazards
are statistically different from zero at the one percent level in all equations except
DEV (significance at ten-percent level). The lower panel presents estimates from
nonparametric selectivity correction (Assumption 2), using third-order polynomials
in the location's propensity score interacted with indicators for presence at all other
locations. 2 tests on the series terms overwhelmingly reject their joint equality to
zero. The translog cost function regressors predict the bulk of labor demand vari-
ation across locations, with R2 regression fits ranging between .92 and .97 for all

equations. Regression fits are similar under parametric and nonparametric selectiv-
ity correction. Overall, we consider the significance of selectivity correction terms
strong evidence for the importance of the extensive margin.
5.2.2 Tests for parametric selectivity correction
We test whether Assumption 1 for parametric selection correction is satisfied in our
context. There are two cases: (a) the part of the selection shock that correlates with
labor demand shocks is an MNE-specific disturbance and does not vary by location,
and (b) the labor-demand related part of the selection shock varies by location but
is independent of labor demand shocks in other locations. We test the two cases
in turn. Tests fail to reject case (a), but they do reject case (b). We consider the
assumptions of case (a) both economically plausible and statistically acceptable.
Consider (a) MNE-specific selection shocks whose labor demand related part
does not vary by location. This case implies that the covariance between selec-
tion disturbances is the same for any pair of locations k = . We obtain estimates
of those covariances from multivariate probit estimation of simultaneous selection
into the four foreign locations. In the cross section of MNEs in 2000 with multivari-
ate probit regressors from 1996, we fail to reject the joint equality of six correlation
coefficients between the four equations with a 2 test statistic of 4.63 (p value .592).
Under a restriction on the selection disturbance, another implication of case (a) is
that, if an MNE is neither present in all locations nor absent from all locations, the
choices of presence and absence must be consistent with a location-independent
MNE-specific selection shock for all locations. We calculate the regression predic-
tion for all MNEs that are not omnipresent, pick the maximum probit prediction
among all locations of absence and the minimum probit prediction among all lo-
cations of presence thus stacking the cards of the test against case (a). Although
191 out of 1,941 observations show the wrong pattern, a one-sided t-test of the
null hypothesis that absence and presence predictions are reversed is rejected over-
whelmingly with a t statistic of 77.4 (zero p value).
Second, consider (b) location-varying selection shocks that are independent of
labor demand shocks in other locations. This assumption implies that labor demand
residuals from one location must have no correlation with labor demand residuals
from any other location. We reject this hypothesis for three out of six pairs of the
four location residuals with p values below .01, for two pairs with p values below
.1, but fail to reject zero correlation in one remaining case (CEE-OIN).
While case (b) is rejected, there is no evidence against case (a) where selection
35
disturbances correlate with labor demand shocks only through an MNE-specific
shock but not through location-specific shocks. Note that cross-location correla-
tions of labor demand errors are not evidence against case (a) because MNE-specific
selection shocks themselves induce a correlation between the labor demand distur-
bances across locations. As discussed before, case (a) is plausible in economic
terms. Suppose selection disturbances include both host country-specific parts such
as, for example, surprising changes to profit repatriation policies and include MNE-
specific parts. Changes to host country repatriation policies affect the entry de-
cision. But once the MNE operates in the host country, it minimizes costs irre-
spective of entry-relevant host-country shocks so that cost function disturbances are
unrelated to the entry-relevant policy shocks. Given supportive test results and the
economic plausibility of case (a), we regard estimation under parametric selectivity
correction (Assumption 1) a relevant benchmark.
5.2.3 Elasticities of multinational labor substitution
Table 10 shows own-wage and cross-wage substitution elasticities for permanent
wage changes by one percent in different locations, separately for the extensive and
the intensive margins. There is no well-defined extensive margin for selection into
the home location (Germany) in a sample of MNEs, which are observable to the
statistician only when active in the home location. The standard errors are from 200
bootstraps over the two estimation steps of parametric selectivity corrected translog
estimates (Assumption 1). One margin at a time is set to zero to isolate the effect
at the other margin. Cross-price elasticities are affine transformations of translog
coefficients (equation (10)). While log wage effects on wage bill shares are additive
in translog estimation at the intensive and the extensive margin (equation (6)), cross-
wage substitution elasticities are not.
Own-wage elasticities along the diagonal--for both the intensive and the ex-
tensive margins--are uniformly negative, and significantly negative, as production
theory requires. While this might be expected for estimates at the intensive margin,
it is a reassuring finding for estimates at the extensive margin. Note that we impose
linear homogeneity in factor prices and symmetry of wage coefficients at the inten-
sive margin through constraints on the translog regression, but we do not restrict es-
timates at the extensive margin because those constraints are not well defined at the
observation level--neither under parametric nor nonparametric selectivity correc-
tion. The own-wage elasticity of substitution is considerably larger in most foreign
locations than at home, suggesting that MNE employment abroad responds more

sensitively to labor costs there than home employment responds to home wages.
Cross-wage elasticities in the first row (foreign wage effects on home employ-
ment) and in the first column (home wage effects on foreign employment) are signif-
icantly positive for eleven out of thirteen estimates at the intensive and the extensive
margins. A one-percent reduction in the wage in CEE, for instance, is associated
with a .05 percent drop in home employment at German MNE parents. In contrast,
a one-percent increase in the German sector wage is associated with a 1.6 percent
boost to MNE employment in CEE at the intensive margin and a .8 percent boost at
the extensive margin. So, home and CEE employment are substitutes within MNEs.
The large difference in cross-wage effects is consistent with two main facts. First,
employment at German MNE parents is larger in levels than at their CEE affiliates
so that a smaller percentage wage drop in Germany means a larger reduction in em-
ployment in absolute terms. Second, CEE workers tend to be less productive than
German workers, which is reflected in the translog cost function coefficients.
The extensive margin is a noticeable component of adjustment, beyond its cru-
cial role in correcting cost function estimates for location selectivity bias. Elastici-
ties at the extensive margin are strictly positive. So, home and foreign employment
are substitutes within MNEs not only at the intensive but also at the extensive mar-
gin. Although the CEE and DEV home wage effects on selection were not statisti-
cally different from zero on the first stage with probit (Table 7), the strong signifi-
37
cance of the selection effect on labor demand on the second stage in CEE (selectivity
hazard coefficient in Table 9) turns home wage effects into significant predictors of
employment substitution at the extensive margin. Beyond the marginal wage coeffi-
cients from two-step estimation, observed wage bill shares provide information for
elasticity estimation and thus contribute to the significance of elasticity estimates.
Elasticities at the extensive margin are smaller in magnitude than at the intensive
margin in the geographically close locations CEE and WEU, and in OIN. In DEV,
however, the extensive margin dominates the insignificant elasticity at the intensive
margin and we find a .8 percent increase in DEV employment in response to a
one-percent home wage increase--similar in magnitude to that in CEE. In CEE, a
one-percent increase in the German home wage is also associated with a .8 percent
increase in MNE employment at the extensive margin, if no adjustment occurs at
the intensive margin.
We also add the intensive and extensive wage effects on wage bills and compute
the total home wage elasticities of foreign labor demand. We find highly signifi-
cant estimates for the total elasticities at three locations: 1.61 in CEE, 2.51 in OIN
and 2.45 in WEU (significantly different from zero at the one-percent level). Our
200 bootstraps allow us to test whether the elasticities at the intensive margin are
significantly different from the total elasticities. We reject their equality for DEV,
OIN and WEU (with t statistics between 2.1 and 16.6) on UNIDO wages and reject
their equality for all locations (t statistics between 4.1 and 21.4) on OWW wages,
corroborating the importance of the extensive margin.
Cross-wage estimates beyond the first row and column are for the most part
not statistically different from zero. Notable exceptions at the intensive margin are
significant pairs of positive cross-wage effects involving WEU: on the one hand of
OIN on WEU (.36) and vice versa (.90), and on the other hand of DEV on WEU
(.05) and vice versa (.45). The significantly positive and mutually consistent effects
suggest that MNE employment is a substitute at the intensive margin between OIN
and WEU and between DEV and WEU. The substitution effect is also corroborated
by a positive cross-wage elasticity between OIN and WEU (1.14) at the extensive
margin.
5.3 Specification comparisons
To assess the robustness of our estimates, we compare several further specifications
and report the first rows of the cross-wage elasticity matrices (foreign wage effects
on home employment) in Table 11, and the first columns separately by intensive and

Foreign-wage elasticities of home employment are robust across specifications
(Table 11). Estimates on our benchmark sample (first row) with UNIDO wages and
MNEs between 1998 and 2001 under Assumption 1 conform closely to several other
specifications. The similarity between the 1998-2001 MNE sample and the single
cross section of MNEs in 2000 (with location choice in 1996) in the second row
is consistent with the view that cross sectional and not time series variation is the
main source of identification at the intensive margin. OWW and UBS wage data in
the third and fourth row result in smaller estimation samples and perhaps introduce
attenuation bias for some coefficients (the UBS wage data are particularly sketchy
for CEE). Coefficient estimates are nevertheless similar across wage data. Non-
parametric estimation does not yield statistically different estimates, neither under
Assumption 2 nor 3, excepting DEV. The sample of 93 omnipresent MNEs between
1996 and 2001 is small but results in significant outcome estimates on the second
stage (we predict selectivity hazards from first-stage regressions on the full sample);
the magnitude of coefficient estimates, when significant, is considerably larger than

for the stacked samples, suggesting that foreign employment at omnipresent MNEs
responds more elastically to home wages. Estimates for DEV are not significant
except for nonparametric specifications. This is consistent with the assertion that
higher order series terms in the outcome regression help remove bias that paramet-
ric selectivity correction cannot prevent with a single selectivity hazard.
Home-wage elasticities of foreign employment at the intensive margin (Ta-
ble 12) are robust too. Estimates on our benchmark sample (now in the first column)
conform closely to several other specifications. In fact, the comments on the rows
of Table 11 above apply also to the columns of Table 12, except only that the coef-
ficient estimates for the sample of omnipresent MNEs now closely resemble those
from other specifications.
At the extensive margin, home-wage elasticities of foreign employment (Ta-
ble 13) are (highly) significant in the parametric specifications (columns 1 through
4), for all wage data and in the year 2000 cross section (with UNIDO wages). Co-
efficient magnitudes vary slightly more across specifications than they do at the
intensive margin. Nonparametric estimates of elasticities at the extensive margin
are sample means of the first derivatives of our third-order polynomial series expan-
sions. We compute the elasticities after dropping outlier predictions, for which the
first-stage probability model results in propensity scores outside the zero-one range.

Nonparametric estimates for the extensive margin (columns 5 and 6 of Table 13) are
not statistically different from zero but similar in magnitude when plausible (col-
umn 5, excepting DEV). Although the inclusion of nonparametric series terms in
translog estimation yields more precise estimates of intensive margin coefficients
(Tables 11 and 12) by approximating disturbance components beyond the paramet-
ric selectivity hazard, the series terms do not seem to provide a precise estimate
of the extensive margin itself.We nevertheless view the similarity between para-
metric and plausible nonparametric estimates as an indication that our parametric
benchmark estimates of the extensive margin are reasonable. Point estimates for
omnipresent MNEs (column 7) are smaller than in the benchmark specification, ar-
guably because this selected sample expands to foreign locations more frequently.
Taken together, our results confirm the statistical plausibility of the benchmark
estimates from parametric selectivity correction (Assumption 1). Several tests for
the validity of Assumption 1 fail to reject the identifying hypothesis that selection
shocks correlate with labor demand shocks only through an MNE-specific error but
not through location-specific errors. Nonparametric estimation yields very similar
and highly significant elasticity estimates at the intensive margin. At the exten-
sive margin, the benchmark estimates from parametric selectivity correction are
highly significant but nonparametric estimates fail to attain significance. In short,

the benchmark estimates from parametric selectivity correction are statistically ro-
bust. We now turn to the economic implications of our estimates for multinational
labor substitution.
5.4 Counterfactual Evaluation
Our hypothetical experiment is a permanent change in the wage differential between
home and foreign locations. How much larger would parent employment be if the
wage gap to foreign locations narrowed? How much smaller would affiliate employ-
ment be? Counterfactual predictions in Table 14 give answers to these questions.
We use the home-wage elasticities of foreign labor demand and the foreign-wage
elasticities of home labor demand from our selectivity corrected translog bench-
mark estimates for the 1998-2001 MNE sample (Table 10). These estimates reflect
the employment responses at the mean MNE (the mean MNE in the stacked sample
has propensities of presence abroad as in the first row of Table 4). We multiply
the elasticity estimates with the workforce totals in Table 1 and obtain the implied
employment changes from one-percent increases in wages by margin.
A one percent smaller wage gap between Germany and locations in CEE, for
instance, is associated with around 700 more jobs at German parents and 4,000 less
42
jobs at affiliates in CEE. CEE affiliates tend to have smaller work forces and, ar-
guably, lower labor productivity than German establishments so that employment
in CEE is more sensitive to home wage changes than home employment responds to
foreign wages. The labor substitution effects of one-percent wage changes between
home locations and CEE are smaller than the effects relative to OIN or WEU. In ab-
solute magnitude, however, a closing of the HOM-CEE wage gap by half at constant
elasticities results in larger employment effects than a reduction of the HOM-OIN
or HOM-WEU wage gaps by half. Using country populations as weights for loca-
tion mean UNIDO wages, CEE wages are, on average, 9.9 percent of the German
level in 2000 (population-weighted mean OWW wages in CEE are 9.8 percent). If
the estimated elasticities of substitution are constant at all levels of wages, an in-
crease in CEE wages by 450%(= ((1-.099)/2)/.099) to reduce the wage gap vis `
a
vis Germany by half would bring 330,000 (= 730 · 450) counterfactual manufactur-
ing jobs (with a standard error of 45,000 jobs) to Germany--around a quarter of the
estimated home employment at German manufacturing MNEs (Table 1). If interna-
tional wage gaps shrink at a similar rate as per capita GDP converges to steady state
and Germany is close to its steady state, the CEE-German wage gap would take
around 35 years to contract to half its present size (Barro and Sala i Martin 1992).
The UNIDO wage level in WEU is 78.6 (96.1) percent of that in Germany so that
an increase in WEU wages by 14% (2%) to cut the gap in about half would attract
70,000 (4,000) counterfactual manufacturing jobs to the German plants of German
manufacturing MNEs.
Elasticities of labor substitution are local properties of the MNE's cost func-
tion, however, and the assumption of a constant elasticity of substitution at all wage
levels is coarse. The rough calculations are merely intended to put an economic
meaning to the abstract elasticity figures. In our view, the magnitude of our calcu-
lations for constant elasticities nonetheless underscores the potential importance of
job substitution within MNEs for labor market outcomes.
6 Conclusion
While the public discourse over outsourcing seems to have settled on the idea that
multinational enterprises (MNEs) substitute jobs at home for foreign employment,
economic studies on MNE labor demand across locations have found weak or no
evidence of job substitution. We integrate two distinct branches of the literature--
one on predictions of MNEs' location choices, and one on labor substitutability
43
across established MNE locations--into a single econometric model that corrects
cost function estimation for location selectivity. In our framework, multinational
labor demand responds to wage differentials across locations both at the extensive
margin, when an MNE expands into foreign locations, and at the intensive margin,
when an MNE reallocates jobs across existing foreign affiliates. We derive condi-
tions for common Heckman (1979) selectivity corrections, location by location, and
for nonparametric identification. Cost function estimation, however, conditions on
MNE output. The empirical exercise thus leaves aside the counterfactual question
how the market share and size of an MNE would differ if its access to foreign loca-
tions were limited in spite of global product market competition. This matter is part
of our ongoing research.
Empirical evidence on German manufacturing MNEs shows that firms change
multinational presence only infrequently and hardly alter their number of affiliates
within regions. These infrequent changes to multinational presence at the extensive
margin give rise to rare but salient labor demand effects in response to permanent
wage differentials across locations. With every percentage increase in Central and
Eastern European wages, German manufacturing MNEs are found to allocate 700
MNE jobs to Germany. With every percentage increase in German wages, German
MNEs allocate 2,000 jobs to Central and Eastern Europe at the extensive margin
and 4,000 jobs in total. Given the sizeable wage differential between Germany and
Central and Eastern Europe (requiring a 450 percent increase in Eastern European
wages in 2000 to reduce the gap by half), we conclude that international wage dif-
ferentials have a salient impact on multinational labor substitution.

Appendix
A A Model of the MNE
An MNE's choice of activity can be thought of as a two-stage decision problem. At
moment t -  (i.e.  periods prior to production and sales), MNE j determines at
which locations to produce and faces uncertainty over other MNEs' future output
qi=j,t
, input prices wt
, and its own realized output qjt
. With its location choice, the
MNE also chooses its optimal capital stock vector kjt
across L locations.
On the second stage at time t, location-related uncertainty is resolved and MNE
j chooses output qjt
given its cost function (or, by duality, optimal factor employ-
ment given its production function). The optimal quantity choice q
jt
at time t can
be characterized with first-order conditions
p (qi=j
, q
jt
) 1 - 1/q
jt

Cjt
(q
jt
; kjt
, wt
)
q
jt
( = 1, . . . , L), (A1)
where p (·) is the price of a good from location as a function of competitors' and
own worldwide output, and q
jt
is the elasticity of demand for qjt
with respect to
price p . By the Kuhn-Tucker theorem, q
jt
=0 if inequality holds. So, even if MNE
j is present at location , it may find it optimal to produce qjt
=0 once factor price
and competitors' output are revealed.
On the first stage, MNE j's linear programming problem can be characterized
by the rules for FDI at locations = 1, . . . , L
djt
= 1 Ej,t-
jt
(q ,
jt
) - jt
(qjt
=0) zj,t-
- Fj,t-
+ j,t-
>0 , (A2)
where Fj,t-
denotes MNE j's relevant fixed costs for presence at location and
j,t-
is an MNE-specific disturbance. Expectations depend on MNE j's informa-
tion set zj,t-
. MNE j's linear programming problem on the first stage involves the
simultaneous evaluation of (A2) for each location given the 2L-1 possible combi-
nations of outputs at all remaining locations L-1.
For its location choice on the first stage, an MNE j maximizes its expected
profits Ej,t-
[jt
] where expectations are conditional on the MNE's information set
in period t - . The MNE can produce the vector of outputs qjt
= (q1
jt
, . . . , qL
jt
) at
L locations ( = 1, . . . , L). So, future expected profits are
Ej,t-
[ p(qi=j,t
, qjt
) · qjt
- Cjt
(qjt
; kjt
, wt
) ] . (A3)
The estimated presence rule (5) in the text follows using expected profits (A3) in
criterion (A2).

restrictions on estimation but do not constrain estimates of factor price coefficients
at the extensive margin. We do not impose any returns-to-scale restrictions.
C Currency conversion and deflation
We convert all economic data of foreign affiliates into euro (EUR) and deflate them.
In BuBa's original MIDI data, all information on foreign affiliates is reported in
German currency using the exchange rate at the closing date of the foreign affiliate's
balance sheet. We apply the following deflation and currency conversion method to
all financial variables. Deutschmark (DEM) figures are converted into euro figures
at the rate 1/1.95583 (the conversion rate at inception of the euro in 1999). (i)
We use the market exchange rate on the end-of-month day closest to an affiliate's
17Slaughter (2000) adds ln(k/q) terms to a version of (B1). Given the additive logarithmic struc-
ture, this is equivalent to an affine transformation of the parameter pairs (k
, k
) and (µk,
, k,
)
because ln(k/q) = ln k - ln q.
51
balance sheet closing date to convert the DEM or EUR figures into local currency
for every affiliate. This reverses the conversion applied to the questionnaires at the
date of reporting. (ii) A CPI factor for every country deflates the foreign-currency
financial figures to the December-1998 real value in local currency. (iii) For each
country, the average of all end-of-month exchange rates vis-`
a-vis the DEM or EUR
between January 1996 and December 2001 is used as a proxy for purchasing power
parity of foreign consumption baskets relative to the DEM or EUR. All deflated
local-currency figures are converted back to DEM or EUR using this purchasing-
power proxy.
We use the foreign countries' CPIs (Consumer Price Indices from the IMF's
International Financial Statistics) to deflate the figures. Whenever a country's CPI
is not available from IFS but the main currency used in that country is issued in
some other country, we use the CPI of the currency-issuing country. The CPI de-
flation factors for all countries are rebased to unity at year-end 1998. For the UBS
wage data, we first translate U.S. dollars into Euros and then proceeded as detailed
above. Parent-level and sector-level domestic variables are transformed into De-
cember 1998 Euros using the German CPI.
D Wages
We base our estimation on sectoral manufacturing wages by country between 1996
and 2001 from the UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database at the 3-digit ISIC level,
Rev. 2 (UNIDO 2005). The UNIDO measure of annual sectoral wage bills includes
all payments to workers at establishments in the reference sector and year (wages
and salaries, remuneration for time not worked, bonuses and gratuities, allowances,
and payments in kind; but excludes contributions to social security, pensions, in-
surance, severance and termination pay). We divide the sectoral wage bill by the
sectoral number of workers and employees. We deflate the wages with the country-
level CPI (standardized to unity in December 1998) and convert the foreign currency
to EUR at the December 1998 exchange rate. To mitigate possible workforce com-
position effects in our labor demand regression on wages, we use the sector median
wage by country (and lose sectoral wage variation also for Germany) in the outcome
estimation. We use sectoral UNIDO wages for Germany in selection estimation be-
cause workforce composition behind labor cost measures is not an econometric
concern for location choice. The UNIDO data cover 109 countries and result in the
largest overlap with MIDI observations on German MNEs for estimation.
For robustness checks, we use OWW monthly average wage rates of male work-
ers at the country level for 161 occupations in 155 countries between 1983 and
1999. Missing observations, however, reduce the overlap with MIDI data on Ger-
man MNEs below the overlap that UNIDO data provide. We follow Freeman and
Oostendorp's (2001) recommendation and pick the base calibration with lexico-
graphic weighting for the aggregate wages by country. We deflate the wages with
52
the country-level CPI (standardized to unity in December 1998) and convert the for-
eign currency to EUR at the December 1998 exchange rate. We fill missing values,
by country and occupation group, with information from the latest preceding year
that has wage information available and reuse OWW wages from 1999 in 2000 and
2001. To mitigate workforce composition effects, we take country medians over
161 OWW occupation groups for foreign wages. We multiply the resulting monthly
median occupation wage by twelve to approximate annual earnings for cost func-
tion estimation. Complementing foreign OWW wages, we use the German annual
earnings survey (table 62321 from destatis.de/genesis) and obtain sectoral monthly
wages, broken down into three blue-collar and four white-collar occupation groups
by sector (two-digit NACE 1.1). We compute median wages over these seven occu-
pation groups by sector, deflate them with the German CPI (standardized to unity
in December 1998), and multiply them by twelve to arrive at annual earnings for
cost function estimation. Occupational wage information from the German annual
earnings survey enters the ILO database, on which OWW wages are based, so that
these foreign and domestic wages are compatible.
For additional robustness checks, we also use UBS wage data collected by the
Swiss commercial bank for metropolitan areas around the world in 1994, 1997,
2000 and 2003 (UBS 2003). We linearly interpolate UBS wages between survey
years to cover our sample period 1996-2001. UBS carried out surveys in approxi-
mately 70 cities during the second quarter of 1994, 1997 and 2000, and during the
first quarter of 2003. Questionnaires request detailed information on wage compo-
nents, wage deductions and working hours across thirteen occupations. UBS con-
verts wage figures into U.S. dollars and smoothes the effect of day-to-day currency
fluctuations by using the average daily spot rate during the quarter of the UBS sur-
vey. We convert UBS wages into EUR at the average USD/EUR exchange rate
during the survey quarter and deflate figures with the German CPI (standardized
to unity in December 1998). We use the machinist wage as the most closely com-
parable wage to median OWW and German wages. We take UBS wages also for
Germany (and lose sectoral variation).
Whenever foreign price deflators are missing or period-average exchange rate
information is incomplete for purchasing-power parity oriented wage conversion,
we use current exchange rates and the German price deflator.
E Market access
We construct market access measures following Redding and Venables (2004). We
obtain bilateral trade data for 1996 through 2001 and geographic information on
country pairs from CEPII (www.cepii.fr). After filling in missing imports to B from
A with exports information from country A to B, we drop all exports information
and set exports from A to B equal to B's imports from A. We adopt this procedure
because we consider imports, whenever available, more reliably measured than ex-
