From National Policies and Sentiments
to Local Practices and Subjectivities:
Mapping Immigrant Educational Identities
in a Semi-Rural Locale
Seán Anthony Bracken1
Abstract
Given increased trends in globalization, there is a significant lacuna in identity research pertaining to rural or town settings
and the impact that such locales have on pupils' educational identities. The question remains as to whether notions of
"othering," or constraining subjectivities, are adopted and ascribed within schools among more recently arrived immigrant
groups. Drawing on critical post-structuralist research, the following article illuminates how an assemblage of policies,
power flows, performatives, personalities, bodily interactions, and spaces, operating within and outside of schools at
particular times, combined to shape minority ethnic pupils' social and educational identities in two English primary schools
located in a West-Midlands town.

Introduction
As identified by critical theorists (S. J. Ball, 2013; Connell,
2013; Gillborn, Rollock, Vincent, & Ball, 2012; Ortiz &
Jayshree, 2010; Youdell, 2011), practices of cultural,
linguistic, or ethnic elision may be expected within a
systematically unequal society where legal and professional
progress is, "quietly cut back by narrow interpretation,
administrative obstruction, or delay." (Delgado & Stefancic,
2001, p. 24). This occurs in a context where, when
questioned about key professional considerations, newly
qualified teachers in England serving in primary and
secondary schools feel least prepared for engaging with
either linguistic or cultural diversity (Teaching Agency,
2012).
The following research aimed to identify salient factors
influencing the development of educational and social
identities among pupils from minority ethnic communities
attending primary school in more rural locales. Following a
review of current research in the field (S. J. Ball, 2013;
Bell, 2012; Cole, 2011; Deleuze & Guattari, 2004; Koro-
Ljungberg & Barko, 2012; Saldanha, 2012; Tambouku,
2008), this key research focus gave rise to the following
sub-questions:
 How do external policies and wider educational
values, policies and practices influence the ways
schools "do" education and what are the implications
for the educational experience of pupils from minority
ethnic communities (Ainscow, Booth, & Dyson,
2006a; Ball, Maguire, & Braun, 2012; Busher, 2005;
Cole & Masny, 2012; Evans & Davies, 2012;
Glazzard, 2011; Gomolla, 2006; Maguire, Hoskins,
Ball, & Braun, 2011; Taylor-Webb & Gulson, 2013)?
 How do internal dynamics and associated school-
based values and attitudes influence school cultures
and how do they contribute to the formation of
subjectivities and identities (Benjamin, 2002; Cohen,
2014; Deleuze & Guattari, 1994; Proweller, 1999;
Reay, 1998; Schostak & Schostak, 2013; Strand,
2010; Wang, Willett, & Eccles, 2011)?
Method
The research relied on a combined conceptual framework
drawing on Critical Race Theory (CRT) and Deleuzian
philosophy. CRT builds on a wider body of critical theory,
which aims to bring to the surface aspects of societal
inequalities based on ascriptions of "race" or ethnicity and,
in so doing, it challenges dominant social and interactional
assumptions regarding culture, intelligence, language, and
capability (Chakrabarty, 2012; Gillborn et al., 2012). This
also contests "traditional claims of objectivity and

meritocracy" (Calmore, 1992, p. 318) because such claims
may be associated with, and reflective of, differential
aspects of privilege and power. CRT is intimately
concerned with the methods for articulating and listening to
voices which have been eschewed, disadvantaged, and
silenced; it therefore pays particular attention to the
necessity to reflect the voices of those who are the
subject/object within the research (Ladson-Billings, 2003;
Rollock, 2012).
A Deleuzian perspective on school-based beliefs and
practices contends that they are articulated through
language, symbols, bodily movements, and behaviors
within particular spaces, as well as being embodied in the
social structures which are created, maintained, and
modified over time (Cole, 2011; Semetsky, 2012). In this
way, there is scope for the creative reinterpretation of
existing cultural systems because, as argued by Mayo
(2000), the creative use of language can alter behaviors and
practices providing scope for divergent and somewhat
temporary systems to arise, these nonetheless alter the
initial trajectories of power and discourse. The concept of
organic repositioning draws on rhizomic analogies
prevalent in the writings of Deleuze (1990, 2004). The
historical genealogies of Foucault and the universal
grammar associated with Chomsky are broken down to
reveal a series of multifarious interconnectivities, which are
reflected in the workings of the rhizome that
ceaselessly establish connections between semiotic chains,
organizations of power, and circumstances relative to the arts,
sciences, and social struggles. A semiotic chain is like a tuber
agglomerating very diverse acts, not only linguistic, but also
perceptive, mimetic, gestural, and cognitive. (Deleuze &
Guattari, 1994, p. 7)
The practices and subjectivities associated with
schooling become stratified, territorialized, and organized,
but in so doing they also encompass spaces for collapse and
this facilitates the regeneration of novel ideas and practices,
which are referred to as "lines of deterritorialization" or
"lines of flight." (Cole, 2011; Deleuze & Guattari, 1994;
Youdell, 2011)
The application of the methodological framework relied
upon qualitative-based research in two schools in
Clareborne1: Hopton Primary (a local authority [LA]
maintained school) and St. Anthony's (a Roman Catholic
School). Research was conducted over a 9-month period
from September 2012 through May 2013. Research was
restricted to Year 6, the final year of primary education.
The total enrollment in Hopton Primary is 535 pupils; in
the two Year 6 classes, there were six pupils for whom
English was an additional language: three Polish pupils, two
from Latvia, and one from Lithuania. In Hopton, the
research focused on the experiences of these six pupils, of
whom only one was male. I also collected data from
interviews and observations involving the three Year 6
teachers in the two classes: Mrs. Harris who taught in Class
6A, Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Neary, the special educational
needs coordinator (SENCO), who time-shared the teaching
of 6B. In addition, I interviewed Ms Bronowski, a Polish
immigrant who was a qualified teacher but who acted as a
teaching assistant (TA) with responsibility for pupils with
English as an additional language (EAL). I had many
informal conversations with other staff at the school and I
communicated frequently with and interviewed Mr.
Hawkes, the deputy head teacher with responsibility for
EAL.
St. Anthony's Primary school had a total enrollment of
209 pupils. It was a single form entry and in Year 6, a total
of nine pupils were identified as having EAL; two of these,
a boy and a girl, were of Polish heritage, one boy was
Filipino and the other six were of Kerala Indian heritage;
four of these pupils were boys and two were girls. All of
these pupils agreed to take part in the research. I conducted
observations in the Year 6 classroom and also interviewed
Mrs. Beckett the class teacher. She also acted as a deputy
head teacher and was responsible for leading on; literacy,
Modern Foreign Languages and the Performing Arts. I also
interviewed Mrs. Sexton, the higher level TA who worked
in this class, and the Polish TA, Mrs. Walicki who had
responsibility for EAL within the school. In addition, I
interviewed the head teacher Mrs. Whittington. The
methods used in the research included
 a piloting of the research in a West-Midlands primary
school,
 the critical analysis of school documentation,
 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders;
SENCOs, TAs, head and deputy head teachers, and
pupils within the schools,

The Policy Context: A Review of Pertinent
Literature
The official English policy context toward the recognition
of learner identity and difference is ambiguous, and there
are contrasting views as to how schools are expected to
address societal inequalities and their impacts on pupils'
learning. According to the national school inspectorate
agency charged with ensuring educational quality, "equality
and diversity are important to learners' success (and)
learners cannot achieve well unless individual needs are
met, the provider is inclusive, and equality and diversity are
promoted well" (Office for Standards in Education
[OFSTED], 2011, p. 11). However, inspectors have been
urged to "place greater emphasis on the impact for learners
and reduce the focus on policies and procedures"
(OFSTED, 2011, p. 11). Notions of diversity have been
essentialized so that normed student attainment levels
become the primary criteria for determining how well
schools engage with diversity. Over a decade ago, schools
Bracken 3
were provided with a clear vision for how the concept of
inclusion might be realized within and beyond the school.
Head teachers, staff, and inspectors were informed that
An educationally inclusive school is one in which the teaching
and learning, achievements, attitudes and well-being of every
young person matter. Effective schools are educationally
inclusive schools. This shows, not only in their performance,
but also in their ethos and their willingness to offer new
opportunities to pupils who may have experienced previous
difficulties. This does not mean treating all pupils in the same
way. Rather it involves taking account of pupils' varied life
experiences and needs. (OFSTED, 2002, p. 7)
At the heart of the project of becoming an inclusive
school was a realization that processes were important and
had the potential to impact on ethos. In addition, teachers
were encouraged to place pupils' cultural and linguistic
differences to the forefront of curriculum enactment
(OFSTED, 2002, pp. 9-19). The current advice differs
significantly from that offered to educators a decade ago.
Contemporaneously, at a national level the official narrative
of cultural inclusion is increasingly obscured by a focus
upon drivers for improving standards through competition
and outputs. These external constraints define the ever
restrictive boundaries within which schools and teachers
operate and place limitations on the requisite latitude to be
creative and cognizant of difference (Ainscow, Booth, &
Dyson, 2006b; Glazzard, 2011).
It remains to be determined whether in the current
climate schools still engage in practices of "institutional
racism," such practices were described as entailing
The collective failure of an organisation to provide an
appropriate and professional service to people because of their
colour, culture, or ethnic origin. It can be seen or detected in
processes, attitudes and behaviour which amount to
discrimination through unwitting prejudice, ignorance,
thoughtlessness and racist stereotyping which disadvantage
minority ethnic people. (Macpherson, 1999, p. 28)
With its realization that racism may be evidenced in
social practice rather than being reflected in outcomes alone
it will be challenging to subject discrimination to official
external monitoring. Thus, it is possible that certain school-
based behavior may be constructed on values and beliefs
which are inadvertently exclusionary and racist (Devine,
2005; Solorzano & Ceja, 2000). In addition, as the focus
shifts to educational outcomes and interschool
competitiveness, local policy and provision for the
inclusion of those from minority ethnic communities is in a
state of extreme flux resulting in a fragmentation of services
where it is increasingly challenging for schools and teachers
to access previously available supports and professional
advice (Chowdry & Sibieta, 2011; National Association of
Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers [NASUWT],
2012). These services, as provided through LAs, were
identified as having a pivotal role in assisting teachers to
engage more effectively with cultural and linguistic
diversity (Tikly, Osler, & Hill, 2005; White, Lewis, &
Fletcher-Campbell, 2006). In this context, it is important to
gauge the effects that a dramatically shifting policy
landscape has had in terms of pedagogy and practice.
Findings From the Research: Analyzing
Wider Values and Policies
During the research time frame, a socio-political narrative
emerged portraying immigrants as exploitative and
opportunistic. For example, on February 14, 2013, a press
release from the Prime Minister's office reported, "There's
a lot more to do to make sure that while we're welcoming,
we don't allow people to come here and take advantage of
us, because I think that does happen too often" (Jowitt,
2013). A notional dichotomy is created between the
welcoming British and those from without who connive to
further their own selfish agendas. The characterization
facilitates claims that strains in national services are
attributable to the (unwelcome) presence of immigrants
(Skidmore, 2013). As recognized by Deleuze and Guitarri
(1987), "everything is political, but every politics is
simultaneously a macropolitics and a micropolitics" (p.
213). National policy dialogs are interpreted and transposed
into the affective domain of subjects within local settings.
The positioning of the research in a relatively rural town
was significant. Two teachers in Hopton Primary
recognized and identified how the external to school space
and its attendant social engagements had an impact upon
the educational and social experiences of migrant pupils.
Mrs. Neary expressed a concern about the impact of
majority community parental views on the values and
behaviors of children within the school because there was a
history of some parents lodging complaints about the
presence of Polish pupils within the school. She was very
concerned about the effects of societal racism and how this
might manifest within the school. In her view,
I come from here, but it is a very small-minded county and I
think they find it very hard to accept that Polish and Portuguese
are our biggest intake in population, they don't like the
"invasion" (here she signals inverted commas) of other people.
For some reason, that small-minded attitude here is, "they're
taking our houses, taking our jobs, our land and they're . . .," so
yeah, it kind of has an impact. We have started on that build up
of trying to overcome those issues, but there is a long way to
go. (Interview: Mrs. Neary, Hopton Primary)
Ms. Bronowski, the EAL teacher, had been working as a
TA at the school for 3 years; in that time she noticed that
people's social attitudes have changed in the locality and
this has influenced her own sense of belonging. Ms.
Bronowski spoke about how the name place signs for the
town had been defaced, so that they now read, "welcome to
4 SAGE Open
Poland" instead of "welcome to Clarebourne." For Ms.
Bronowski, the Polish EAL teacher, there is a sense that the
external space has become somewhat hostile to foreigners:
I think myself and most of my friends we just now feel really
conscious and quite careful really about what we say and
something that hasn't happened before like excusing ourselves
that we are here. Previously, I really didn't have to explain, I
mean like saying, "oh I am sorry I am here, sorry that I live
here," I didn't have to do it before, whereas now there is that
pressure on you to explain yourself and explain what really you
bring here to this place that can explain whether you should be
here or not. And even though no one ever says that to me, you
feel urged to somehow excuse yourself for your very existence.
(Interview: Ms. Bronowski, Hopton Primary)
There is a new self-awareness among immigrant
communities, a sense of difference prompted by wider
sociological and political forces, which seek to exclude and
emphasize otherness. On the day of the Prime Minister's
statement, of which Ms. Bronowski was unaware, she
shared,
the very word multiculturalism . . . it doesn't really exist really
any more. I don't know, it is just more about feelings, just
sensing things rather than really experiencing them but, I feel
like . . . we were more welcome here those six, seven years ago
than we are now as Eastern European workers. I think the
whole society, it has been described as broken, but I think also
putting people against each other and because of the difficult
financially and the political climate, I think there are more
things being allowed to be said and more of an overall feeling
that society has become more xenophobic. (Interview: Ms.
Bronowski, Hopton Primary)
For this Polish teacher of English, changing political
sentiments are conjoined with economic factors to alter the
interrelationships with others making for a "sense" of
discomfort and the unease of being other. The teacher
concerned can almost "feel" the impact of political and
social wider thinking.
Within the intertwined national, regional, and local
context, policy development and its mediation take place
within schools while, "through a combination of both media
hype and social and political hype, `threat' profiles are
socially constructed based on physical characteristics;
country of origin and language" (Ortiz & Jayshree, 2010, p.
179). The dialog is compounded by an emerging policy
narrative, as shared recently by the chief inspector of
schools that reinterprets educational disenfranchisement by
splintering particular cohorts into those deserving of
additional resources within schools, for example, "our"
White, British, working class boys, against those who may
no longer be deserving of attention, such as Afro-Caribbean
or "other" males (Adams, 2013). The external policy
narrative was reflected in St. Anthony's. When asked about
the educational engagement of pupils for whom English
was an additional language, the head teacher responded,
We looked at data for closing gaps to show where we were
weaker, where we needed significant improvement, and our
particular group within this school is summer born children,
and so the weakness is there rather than in fact whether
children are Malayalam and EAL children. They pull our
figures up, their data is very strong, and it is our White British
boys that we're concerned about. (Interview: Mrs. Beckett)
This reading of the data was at odds with the spatial
organization of the Year 6 class in St Anthony's where
pupils from ethnic minority backgrounds were
significantly underrepresented in categorizations of "top
performing" groups for English and Math classes and
were as equally represented as British pupils in the
"lowest" groups. The practices of differentiated and
categorizing grouping are themselves problematic and
infused with aspects of power, politics, affect, and
intention (S. J. Ball, 2013; Connell, 2013; Cremin &
Thomas, 2005; Thompson & Cook, 2013). Current school
practices as expressions of the external policy agenda
create an image of being meritocratic, while they are "shot
through with challenging assumptions" (Cole, 2011, p.
552). Policy orientations potentially mask systematic
inequalities of privilege, power, and unintentional
institutional racism within schools (S. J. Ball, 2013;
Gillborn, 2008; Macpherson, 1999).
There are subtle interplays between the role of national
policy discourses and how these are "bought into" by
teachers and the ways in which schools may seek to
reinterpret or redevelop their own transpositions of policy
orientations (S. J. Ball, Maguire, Braun, & Hoskins,
2011; Maguire et al., 2011). The elision of pupils cultural
and linguistic knowledge as exemplified in performance
data sets deficiently labeling cohorts of students as;
"English not as first language" (Department for
Education, 2012), this clearly identifies these pupils as
having potential to underperform. The fix for the need is
to attend to the English language deficit and to bracket
the pupils into appropriate "performance sets" to address
the "problem." A subtle policy reorientation away from
appreciation for multilingualism as exemplified in the
expression of having "English as an additional language,"
has the potential to influence ways in which policy
becomes practice.
While St. Anthony's Primary School Inclusion Policy
indicated the school would
celebrate the achievements of pupils who are bilingual and
encourage pupils for whom English is a second language to
feel proud of their linguistic talents and to continue to use and
develop their first language. (St. Anthony's, Inclusion Policy,
2009, available on the school website­­anonymous)
Hosting an inclusive language policy does not
necessarily lead to the practice of an appreciation for
multilingualism within the school. When questioned about
the extent to which pupils' languages were incorporated
Bracken 5
within the school, the senior TA, who also acts as the
school's EAL coordinator, responded,
I don't think very much, because I don't really know what a
particular policy or curriculum says, but as far as I am
concerned from observing what's happening in classes, I think
teachers are trying to get everything down to one point, so
there isn't really sort of . . . there isn't much happening really
on the celebration of the differences let's say, you have got
different cultures . . . no you need to sit down and write a
proper English sentence sort of thing. (Interview: Mrs. Waliki,
EAL TA, St Anthony's Primary)
Policies are also enacted through school-based practices.
According to the study of ways in which the Ethnic Minority
Achievement Grant (EMAG) was used in schools (Tikly,
Osler, & Hill, 2005), policy makers and educators would do
well to ensure that the grant was targeted to address
institutional racism, provide clear ideas for literacy
enhancement programs, and enable the adoption of a more
inclusive curriculum. However, recent policy developments
have moved significantly away from such advice by ensuring
that local schools fora are allowed to "de-delegate" LA
maintained EMAG school funds. Under this new system,
there is no accountability mechanism regarding schools' use
of this funding (National Association for Language
Development in the Curriculum [NALDIC], 2013). Schools
may decide whether or not to expend funds on supporting the
social and educational support of pupils from ethnic minority
backgrounds. Consequently, Mrs. Neary, the SENCO in
Hopton Primary, argued, "I do have this horrid feeling that
it's going to get worse again because if we need to access the
EAL team it has to come out of our service level agreement
budget," with competing demands the pupils from ethnic
minorities will not emerge as beneficiaries within an
"architecture of policy positions within which divergent
discourses confront one another" (S. J. Ball, 2013, p. 23).
Ultimately, schools are sites where policies "riddled with
power concerns" (Cole & Masny, 2012, p. 2) are contested
and practiced and these influence options for ethos and
culture. Drawing direct causal lines between policy and
school-based effect is problematic. Nonetheless, tangents of
association do link policies, practices, and the resultant
artifacts and spaces which become the enactment of policy
(Evans & Davies, 2012; Heimans, 2012; Maguire et al.,
2011). The "entanglements of policy associations"
(Heimans, 2012, p. 318) create divergent policy practices
and performatives which are imbued with power relations
and these are manifest in the ways schools provide for
learning within differing cultural settings.
Exploring the Relationships Between
School Cultures and Pupil Identities
The second key question sought to highlight
interrelationships between enactments of school cultures
and their influences on individual creativity, potentials for
freedom of expression as well as their constraining
potentialities. Contemporary interpretations of school
cultures see them as being imbued with "a relational sense
of context" (Taylor-Webb & Gulson, 2012) where actors
with prior experiences and beliefs coalesce in particular
spaces and times to form a heteroglossia of
interrelationships imbued with power (Foucault, 1986, p.
118). These have significant implications for practices of
learning and teaching. They are also informed by external
discursive formations of "sovereign, communal meanings"
(Maguire et al., 2011, p. 598), which provide taken-for-
granted and normative assumptions about the nature of
education and how it ought to be realized in schools.
However, there is scope for disruption in communal
practices and perceptions. The Deleuzian concept of
rhizomic flight provides a conceptual gateway through
which historical and social norms may be ruptured giving
way to unpredictable avenues where differences flourish
and become sites for learning. Creativity is enabled because
rhizomic actions and sensibilities reflect the features of the
rhizome, which is
an acentric nonhierarchical network of entangled and knotted
loops, folding and growing through multiple sites of exit and
entry. Rhizomatic growth is contrasted to arboreal or tree
growth in that the latter is hierarchical and bound to one trunk,
whereas the rhizome is a network of proliferating roots and
offshoots. (de Freitas, 2012, p. 557)
Because the research took place in Year 6 classes, for the
schools concerned the primary grand narratives, or
manifestations of the arboreal, coalesced to form
"communal meanings" related to national Standardized
Achievement Tests (SATs) and levels of pupils' attainment.
In addition, there were concerns about the changing nature
of the national curriculum and how it might be best
delivered. The ever looming prospect of external
accountability through the school inspection process
conducted by OFSTED also permeated actions and dialogs,
and these in turn shaped perceptions and expectations of
possible pupil achievements. Categorizations were created
and pupils were subsequently assigned, sectioned, and
bracketed according to perceived ability or impossibility of
learning. The systematic grouping of pupils was also
overlaid with notions of behavior and discipline, where
naughty and unruly boys were assigned to the lowest
performing groups (S. J. Ball, 2013; Youdell, 2011). This
corresponded with my observations in both the schools and
in all three of the classes I observed. While discussing the
rationale for grouping with the head teacher in St Anthony's
school, groupings were discussed as follows:
A class will group for maths and for English and then it is
weighted depending on the paper they are going to be sitting, I
think whether they are an EAL child or not they can then have
that self image and with their self-esteem they might then start
6 SAGE Open
to think, "I am good at this," or "I am not so good at that," but
there are EAL children within the Year 6 grouping who are
spread throughout the class within the different groups so that
you have some in the top group, some in the middle group,
some who were needing more support. (Interview: head
teacher, Mrs. Wittington, St Anthony's Primary)
The use of the word weighted reveals the contrastive
analyses used to assign individuals according to their
perceived intellectual weightiness and how they are
ascribed to groups accordingly. The process corresponds
with Foucault's (1991) analysis of how educational
establishments create mechanisms of disciplinary and
sorting powers. These produce hierarchical classifications
to delineate spaces that correspond to the worthfullness of
individuals using criteria of "bodies, activities and time"
(Youdell, 2011, p. 37). To some extent, the head teacher
appears troubled by the experience, she realizes there may
be affective side effects associated with the sorting
machine's end results, and there is a recognition that pupils
may internalize emotive fallout from the process. However,
for the rational logic of the system to stay intact and for
pupils to operate effectively,
They need to tolerate those differences with each other and that
is quite a hard skill for children to learn; "I am ok with this,
and in fact I am good at that, but I need a bit of help with this"
and that is a tough message, because rather than think the
world will come crashing down and "I am no good," you just
have to make sure that if those groupings are set in place what
do the children still recognise as their strengths even if they
need support. (Interview: head teacher, Mrs. Wittington, St
Anthony's Primary)
It is not that the system of grouping that is perceived as
being problematic, rather the necessity for individual pupils
to come to terms with their own standing within the groups.
However, from a pupil's perspective this situation is very
different. In an interview with Tanvi, a female pupil of
Malayalam heritage, the educational experience is seen as
being analogous to the medical; a recurring concern within
Tanvi's narrative is the concern for how to "get better," her
academic performance is an illness from which hard work
will make her recover.
Researcher: Let's have a look at some of the other photos,
what's this one?
Tanvi: Well, that's some books and I like reading because I can
learn from them and know how to get better at writing stories .
. . and I could get to a higher group than am now . . .
Researcher: So what group are you in now?
Tanvi: Em . . . (4 s delay) eh, well we don't have names for the
tables, but eh . . . I'm in like the second lowest (photo
interview, Tanvi, St Anthony's).
The concern is that such practices "systematically
elevate the standing of notions such as ability, intelligence,
talent, and learning difficulty" (Cremin & Thomas, 2005, p.
432), while the concepts should be openly interrogated
within schools as being socially constructed. Just as pupils
are weighed and measured, so too are the schools:
We are very much prescribed by Government, this is what you
can teach and you know we do work towards that because this
is the same as any other school, this is how we are measured so
to a certain extent we will play the game and get ourselves
measured and come out at the right end, at the end of the day it
is data that will make us float or sink as a school. (Interview:
deputy head teacher, Mr. Hawkes, Hopton Primary)
The cultural parameters within which schools operate are
guided by organizing principles of grouping and
differentiation to which they are subjected, and these have
as its basis "the primary and fundamental character of the
norm" (S. J. Ball, 2013, p. 51). The norm is established in a
public domain of comparative data analysis and is
dependent upon classroom-based practices of "educational
triage" involving
the deployment of notions of ability and intelligence, notions
that are suffused with age old ideas of race and class hierarchy
and which cement these classifications and their hierarchical
arrangement and normalize the uneven distribution of
opportunities and outcomes across differentiated groups of
students. (Youdell, 2011, p. 14)
What is important here is that the delimiting dialogs of
"good work," "effort," and acceptable and resistant
behaviors fashion the ways in which pupils and teachers
think about and engage with their work and produce shared
understandings about what is acceptable. For example, as
identified in my observation notes in Mrs. Beckett's class
the contributions from Wojciech, a Polish pupil adjudged to
have special educational needs in addition to "being EAL,"
were imbued with suspicion and tinged with
unacceptability. However, when Wojciech is supervised by
a perapathetic teacher in ICT class, he becomes animated
and creative. A co-constructor of knowledge that belies his
normative status of EAL/SEN person (Class observation,
fieldnotes, St. Anthony's). Though the narrative of norming
is pervasive, creative movements along the lines of flight
can disrupt the prevailing order of things by producing
multiple becomings that are collective, dynamic, and social
(A. Ball, 2009; Cole, 2011; Colebrook, 2002).
This is also reflected in one of my classroom experiences
in St Anthony's. According to my field notes from February
2013, I arrive at Mrs. Beckett's classroom and am struck by
the tectonic shifts that have taken place, I have been away
from the room for no more than 10 min and in the interim,
there has been a change of subject focus from mathematics
with its solidly defined groupings to religious education
where pupils are enabled to intermingle. The class spirit has
lifted; there is open communication, sharing, and
collaboration. A buzz of excited voices fills the classroom.
Bracken 7
Movement has taken hold of sedentary bodies because each
pupil was provided with a piece of information that all
needed to complete a comprehensive class-based learning
puzzle. I feel as if I have been in two very different places:
one of control and segregation, the other a place of
dynamism, movement, and full of learning potential.
Lines of flight can come about from opening doors to
outside, so that affectation takes hold of the educational
space. During their interviews, three of the teachers in
Hopton Primary spoke of the school's openness to the wider
community. Mr. Hawkes spoke excitedly about an open day
for grandparents, a concept borrowed from the Polish
school system:
We actually did it the day of our Ofsted inspection, which of
course we didn't know this, but it just happened to be the
same time, we invited the grandparents of our year one and
two children into school, at one point we did have
grandparents down the corridor, out the door, across the car
park and down, down the road queuing to come in, we were
slightly having kittens at that point, I think we had­­I think
this is against all the fire regulations you can possibly have­­
we were getting on for nearly like 600 grandparents, it was
absolutely amazing. (Interview: Mr. Hawke, deputy head
teacher, Hopton Primary)
The engagement of grandparents from the community
might represent a contra "flow of energy," which is
differentiated from the normative patterns or discourses of
individualization (Ringrose, 2011, p. 206). There was scope
for the difference outside to take hold within the school and
internal difference had been elevated to the level of the
absolute, it is the difference of pupils that motivates the
school to incorporate and follow that difference as a line of
flight from normative educational experiences (Cole, 2005).
A normed and currently accepted conceptualization of
difference as expressed in grouping according to ability is
referred to as "differentiation"; however, the practice is in
fact a tyranny of repetition and sameness designed to limit
potentialities for creativity and innovation, which is the real
site for difference as the beginning of learning (Ringrose,
2011).
Difference as the basis for pedagogy is not universally
accepted or practiced within schools, and this pertains
particularly to the non-recognition of pupils' home
languages. During the early phases of the research, when I
met with pupils for the first few times, I wanted to share
with them my belief that knowledge of differing languages
is a positive part of who we are, some of my early field
notes recorded such an incidence in St Anthony's. While I
was leading the camera research training, I drew on some of
my knowledge of Pacific languages to ask Joselito who is
Filipino to count with me in Tagalog; we count slowly from
one to five: "isa, dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima," he smiles as he
counts along with me. Abha, his "clever girl" Kerala
classmate shares, "this is the first time I've ever heard him
speaking in his own language." She seems surprised that he
is someone who has capacity beyond being one of the boys
in the second worst performing group in class, someone
perhaps who might have access to aspects of knowledge
that have remained untapped.
The silenced languages of pupils are sedimented under a
hierarchy of linguistic preferences where acceptable other
"modern" foreign languages are featured in the curriculum,
no rationale is offered to pupils as to why their languages
do not matter, it is not explained as to why they are
inconsequential in the educational world of reified pre-
packaged knowledge. In Hopton Primary, Spanish is taught
as a second language once a week, whereas in St Anthony's
Primary, all of the pupils learn German. Rendering invisible
previously acquired literacy and multilingual fluencies
recasts immigrants into an always deficit mode of needing
to catch up, the characterization is then of the needy student
who requires the assistance of others to acquire the accepted
phonic and literacy skills to become "more normal"
(Stevens, 2009). Pupils' cultural and linguistic selves are
subjectivized by such experiences as is evidenced in the
interview with Katarina, a "lower performing" Polish pupil
who has lived in the UK for three years:
Interviewer: Did you ever write in Polish?
Katarina: No.
Interviewer: Would you ever like to?
Katarina: No, because I don't like it, because it's hard.
Interviewer: Are there any books in Polish at the school?
Katarina: Really, I don't know . . . I like using the library and
reading in England, in English in school because it's much
easier for me.
Interviewer: Would you like to know more about Polish
history?
Katarina: No, emmmm I don't want it, because I'm always
interested in em English stuff, em English history, and em
books.
Interviewer: Would you like to see a Polish teacher?
Katarina: Em, I already have, she's not really a teacher, she's
sometimes a helper.
Interviewer: But would you like to see a Polish teacher or
head teacher?
Katarina: No, it's good to have an English one (Photo
elicitation interview: St. Anthony's Primary).
As a "lower performing" pupil, Katarina inhabits the
peripheries of the classroom and this existence on the edges
is also a place where her identity and socialization is
developed. Her space has been identified for her and it is
one for those, "racialised others who occupy the liminal
space of alterity" (Rollock, 2012, p. 66). The marginal
status may not be created consciously; rather it is defined
by the subtleties of absences and presences in literacy, in
math, in the geographies of classroom and subject where
the terrain does not include Poland or the Polish. These are
the unseen dynamics where the curriculum and classroom
create "hierarchical racial structures" that bind pupils within
8 SAGE Open
categories "that serve to maintain unequal order in society"
(Ladson-Billings & Donnor, 2008, p. 72). Because the
narrative maintains that all pupils are equal, there is no
space to raise the significance of invisible and invidious
racism where "difference is deficit, meritocracy is
appropriate, and English-is-all-that-matters" (Mitchell,
2013, p. 342). As Mitchell (2013, p. 341) points out, this is
where the classroom content is peopled by "majoritarian
stories, or normative narratives" that promote racist
outcomes but where racism is never acknowledged as being
an issue. However, the experiences of Annessa at Hopton
Primary school were somewhat different, as she shared
during an interview:
Sometimes we have like a language of the week and in the
morning and afternoon we'd have to say like "good morning"
or "good afternoon" in that language and it was Russian once,
but we haven't done Lituanian and at the time I had to teach
everyone how to say hello and good afternoon in Russian, so if
it was this week you'd have to say dobre utra and if it was the
afternoon you'd have to say dobre dien. (Photo elicitation
interview: Hopton Primary)
Annessa's role, for at least one day, has been that as a
knower and guide enabling other pupils and the teachers to
learn what she already has acquired. Earlier in the
interview, Annessa described England as being her home,
she is comfortable with her friends and her surroundings
and she has no desire to live in Eastern Europe. For her,
there are differing dimensions to her Englishness and one of
those is the capacity to speak in several languages, which is
a positive attribute to her identity:
Annessa: When I'm home with my brother I don't really chat
to him in Lithuanian, sometimes we might but really the
whole time we talk English. With my mum, I speak with
her Russian, with my mom it's Russian, with my dad
Lithuanian, with my Nan its Russian and Lithuanian, and
with my brother it's English, but with my little brother, he's
4 he was born in England and I talk to him in Lithuanian,
Russian, and English. When I'm with my family we usually
talk Russian and sometimes Lithuanian. In school, I'd like
to be able to talk Russian, and to teach it 'cos sometimes
you have a secret to tell and then you could say it and
others would understand.
Interviewer: How do you feel to have lots of different
languages?
Annessa: Quite happy 'cos it might help me with my future
and it's just good to have more languages than one. I got
some Russian books and some Lithuanian books and my
Nan teaches me Russian and I teach myself English in
school (Photo elicitation interview: Hopton Primary).
Having conducted a comprehensive review of the
literature, Mitchell (2013, p. 349) argues that there are close
relationships between the positive incorporation of pupils'
linguistic and cultural identities and their concept of self.
She also states that there are strong correlations between the
use of fist language and the capacity of pupils from ethnic
minority communities to engage with learning meaningfully
(O'Hara & Pritchard, 2008). Providing for linguistic
diversity within schools also allows for enhanced
collaboration with the wider community, which affects
parental involvement in schools, a key determiner of
educational success (Asher, 2007; Gibson & Hidalgo, 2009;
Suárez-Orozco & Suárez-Orozco, 2009).
Perceptions of languages and their attendant cultures are
determined according to interpersonal conventions and
perceptions of what is, or should be identified as "the
norm." The extent to which they are incorporated in the life
of schools is fashioned by the unwritten values and
practices of acceptance, ambivalence, or antagonism toward
linguistic diversity among teachers and pupils alike.
Teacher subjectivities embody understandings of perceived
possibilities within the constraints of "delivering" a
traditional curriculum, as congruence with existing and
familiar social expectations of the non-urban classroom are
intertwined with such constraints, there are delimiting
spaces available for exploration and difference within the
realms of what might be taught and how it might be taught.
Conclusion
As evidenced in the interview with Mrs. Bronowski at
Hopton, the effects of policies which are antagonistic
toward others (Aithenhead, 2013) and external to school
social dialogs had profound affective implications, which
were simultaneously disempowering and subjectifying. The
findings indicate that while there is a place for developing
inclusive policies within schools, the role of cultural
practices and values was seen to be more significant in
influencing the ways that teachers engaged with pupils. For
example, while there was a very inclusive language and
culture policy displayed on the school's website at St.
Anthony's Primary, teachers' practices and a shared belief
in the "universality" of pupil experience were at variance
with a commitment to engage positively with difference.
The most significant attribute of external influences on
school-based practices was associated with the ways in
which space was carved with bodies in preparation for
standardized assessments and to facilitate "individual
differentiation," a notion charged with taken-for-granted
suppositions and quintessentially laden with values and
power.
Cultures within schools and classrooms were enmeshed
with power flows between and within external and internal
comprising an enfolding that involved "a moving matter
animated by . . . movements, folds and foldings that
together make up an inside: they are not something other
than the outside but precisely the inside of the outside"
(Deleuze, 1988, p. 97). A shared creation of othering
exemplified how teachers recreated the culture of schooling
to define aspects of normality and the shared identification
Bracken 9
of those who were perceived as being beyond the bounds of
education.
However, classroom and school cultures were not
immutable, there was evidence of cultural changes and of
rhizomic reorientations, which provided opportunities for
teachers and for schools to alter cultural forces of
subjectivization (S. J. Ball, 2013). Avenues were created
that countervailed the regimentation of stigmatizing data
through "individuation," where the Deleuzian concept of
individuation is understood as openness to dynamic
processes involving intensive capacity "to affect and be
affected" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. xvi). Affects are not
simple personal feelings, but "becomings that spill over
beyond whoever lives through them (thereby becoming
someone else)" (Deleuze, 1995, p. 137): becoming-other
(Semetsky & Delpech-Ramey, 2012, p. 71).
This was achieved, for example, within Hopton
Primary's willingness to involve the language of the other
as part of the curriculum and as exemplified by their
opening of the school gates to the grandparents of pupils
within. In St. Anthony's, this was achieved when pedagogy
of non-core subjects was released from the constraint of
hierarchical differentiation enabling individuals to redefine
predefined concepts of self and identity. Ultimately, by
sharing ways in which schools engage with difference there
is a scope to alter powerful policy laden preconceptions and
to enhance pupils' lived and educational encounters in,
with, and through being different.
