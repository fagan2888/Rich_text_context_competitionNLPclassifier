OBJECTIVE--Whereas it is known that the metabolic syndrome (MetS) has a paradoxically
lower prevalence in non­Hispanic black adolescents than in non­Hispanic whites or Hispanics,
the relative severity of MetS by race/ethnicity is unknown. Inflammation, indicated by high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), is a key factor linking MetS to cardiovascular disease and
type 2 diabetes. Our goal was to determine whether elevations of hsCRP vary by race/ethnicity
among adolescents with MetS.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--We used the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1999­2008) and evaluated adolescents (age 12­19 years) using a pediatric/
adolescent adaptation of the ATP III definition of MetS. We used linear regression to evaluate the
interaction between MetS status and ethnicity with respect to hsCRP concentration.
RESULTS--For male and female adolescents, MetS was associated with elevated hsCRP levels
compared with adolescents without MetS. However, the elevation in hsCRP between adolescents
with and without MetS was greater in non­Hispanic blacks compared with that in non­Hispanic
whites (P = 0.04) but not that in Hispanics (P = 0.18). hsCRP concentrations correlated with
individual MetS components similarly among all ethnicities. In an evaluation of adolescents
diagnosed with MetS, non­Hispanic blacks had higher BMI and more hypertension than other
ethnicities but there were no other racial/ethnic differences in the features of MetS.
CONCLUSIONS--Non­Hispanic black adolescents have a greater differential in hsCRP be-
tween those with and those without MetS than the differential in non­Hispanic whites but not
that in Hispanics. Therefore, even though MetS has a low prevalence in non­Hispanic blacks,
MetS is a particularly good indicator of inflammation in non­Hispanic black adolescents.

The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a
clustering of cardiovascular risk fac-
tors that are related to insulin re-
sistance, specifically, elevated waist
circumference, hypertriglyceridemia,
low HDL-cholesterol, hypertension, and
fasting hyperglycemia (1). MetS is related
to inflammation (2) and functions as an
independent predictor of long-term risk
for cardiovascular disease and type 2 di-
abetes among both adults (3) and chil-
dren (4). Whereas the relationships
between MetS, inflammation, and long-
term risks are well described in the gen-
eral population, these relationships have
not been delineated in non­Hispanic
black individuals. Non­Hispanic blacks
are less likely than non­Hispanic whites
and Hispanics to be classified as having
MetS, largely based on a lower prevalence
of dyslipidemia (5­7). Nevertheless,
non­Hispanic blacks are more likely
than non­Hispanic whites to exhibit insu-
lin resistance (8,9) and to develop cardio-
vascular disease and type 2 diabetes
(10,11), which brings into question the
accuracy of current criteria for classifying
MetS among non­Hispanic blacks (6).
Similarly, the relationship of MetS with
increased inflammation among non­
Hispanic blacks is unclear.
High-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP) is a marker of inflammation that
in adults is an independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes
(12,13). Among children and adolescents,
elevated hsCRP levels are predictive of
adult hsCRP levels 20 years later (14)
and are independently associated with ar-
terial changes that precede cardiovascular
disease, including carotid artery intima-
media thickness (15).
Our goal was to determine whether
elevations in hsCRP values among ado-
lescents with MetS vary by race/ethnicity.
We used the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES)
1999­2008 and a pediatric/adolescent
adaptation of the Adult Treatment Panel
III (ATP III) definition of MetS (1) to ex-
plore the relationship between MetS and
hsCRP on a race/ethnicity-specific basis.

Health Statistics of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control, with data released every 2
years (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm). The National Center for Health Sta-
tistics ethics review board approved the
survey, and participants were provided
with informed consent prior to participa-
tion. Aspreviouslydescribed,waistcircum-
ference, blood pressure, and laboratory
measures of triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol,
and glucose were obtained using standard-
ized protocols and calibrated equipment
(1). All blood samples used for analyses
were obtained from participants asked to
fast $8 h prior to blood draw.
Diagnosis of MetS
MetS was defined by a pediatric/adoles-
cent adaptation of the ATP III criteria (1).
Participants had to meet three or more
of the following five criteria: concen-
tration of triglycerides $110 mg/dL,
HDL-cholesterol #40 mg/dL, waist cir-
cumference $90th percentile for age/sex
(or, if lower, the ATP III limit of 102 cm
for male participants and 88 cm for female
participants) (16), glucose concentration
$100 mg/dL, and systolic or diastolic
blood pressure $90th percentile (age,
height, and sex specific) (17).
Data from non­Hispanic white, non­
Hispanic black, or Hispanic (Mexican
American/other Hispanic) adolescents
age 12­19 years were analyzed. Children
,12 years old were excluded because
fasting values for triglycerides and glu-
cose were only obtained in participants
$12 years old. Subjects with known di-
abetes and pregnancy and individuals
taking antihyperlipidemic or antidiabetic
medications were excluded from the
study. Participants taking antihyperten-
sive medication were classified as having
hypertension. Children with hsCRP $10
mg/L were excluded because of an associ-
ation with acute infection or chronic in-
flammatory disease (18).
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was defined as a P
value #0.05. To maximize total sample
size, we combined datasets from the
four 2-year cycles (1999­2008) for statis-
tical analyses. Prevalence rates of MetS
were calculated by sex, race/ethnicity,
and NHANES cycle and compared with
x2 tests. Mean hsCRP was compared
among groups using unpaired Student t
tests or ANOVA. Linear regression was
used to assess the effect of sex, race/eth-
nicity, and MetS status on levels of ln
(hsCRP). The natural log transformation

of hsCRP was used to achieve normality.
All interactions of the three covariates
(sex, race/ethnicity, and MetS status)
were initially included in the model but
removed in a stepwise fashion if the asso-
ciated interaction P value was .0.15. Be-
cause of the known effects of poverty
(19), education (19), and smoking (20)
on hsCRP, each of these covariates was
included in the model. Education was
classified as the highest level obtained
for any household member and catego-
rized as follows: less than high school,
high school, and more than high school.
Income-to-need ratio was used to mea-
sure poverty. Because of the poor reli-
ability of self-reporting of smoking
among adolescents (21), serum level of
cotinine was used to identify smokers,
with a cutoff of 15 ng/mL as recommended
(22). Geometric means of hsCRP from the
final model were estimated and compared
among race/ethnicity, as applicable.
Following the comparison of geo-
metric means of hsCRP, racial/ethnic dif-
ferences in the relationship between
hsCRP and MetS were further evaluated.
This was performed by calculating Pear-
son r correlation coefficients to determine
the degree of linear association between
MetS components and ln(hsCRP) by
race/ethnicity. Finally, means and preva-
lence of MetS components were compared
by race/ethnicity among adolescents with
MetS. With the exception of the correla-
tion estimates, all analyses incorporated
the sampling weights included from
NHANES. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using SAS (version 9.2; SAS,
Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 10; Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Trian-
gle Park, NC), which account for the
survey design when estimating SEs to ob-
tain population-based estimates.
RESULTS
MetS prevalence
The sample of participants consisted
of 3,559 non­Hispanic blacks, non­
Hispanic whites, and Hispanics age 12­
19 years with data for all variables tested.
Among adolescents, the prevalence of
MetS was greater among male than female
participants (11.0 vs. 5.5%; P , 0.01) and
among non­Hispanic whites and
Hispanics compared with non­Hispanic
blacks (8.6, 10.8, and 4.5%, respectively;
P , 0.05) (Table 1), as has previously
been reported for adolescents and adults
(5,6). The prevalence of MetS did not dif-
fer over the test period (1999­2008).
Individual components of MetS are
presented in Table 1. Compared with
non­Hispanic whites and Hispanics,
non­Hispanic blacks had lower triglycer-
ides and fasting glucose and higher HDL-
cholesterol and systolic blood pressure.
Hispanics had the highest waist circum-
ference but otherwise did not exhibit dif-
ferences in individual MetS components
compared with non­Hispanic whites and
non­Hispanic blacks.
hsCRP levels
Levels of hsCRP were higher in adolescent
female than in male participants. hsCRP
levels were also higher in Hispanics
than in non­Hispanic whites and non­
Hispanic blacks (Table 1).
Covariates in the linear model of ln
(hsCRP) are shown in Table 2. Household
education level and smoking were signif-
icantly associated with levels of hsCRP, as
shown previously (19,20). Two pairwise
interactions were significant and thus
remained in the model: sex 3 ethnicity
(P = 0.0494) and MetS 3 ethnicity (P =
0.1249). Overall, female participants had
higher hsCRP values than male partici-
pants (13), with the greatest difference be-
tween sexes observed amongnon­Hispanic
blacks. MetS had a significant effect on
hsCRP for all examined ethnicities, with
hsCRP levels increasing the most for
non­Hispanic blacks with MetS.
Geometric means of hsCRP levels by
sex and ethnicity (generated from the
linear model of ln(hsCRP)) are shown in
Fig. 1A­B. In both male and female par-
ticipants, each ethnicity exhibited higher
hsCRP values among adolescents with
MetS compared with those in adolescents
without MetS (P , 0.01 for all three eth-
nicities). Among adolescent male partici-
pants without MetS, Hispanics had higher
levels of hsCRP than non­Hispanic blacks
(P = 0.017) but not non­Hispanic whites
(P = 0.10). For adolescent female par-
ticipants without MetS, Hispanics had
higher levels of hsCRP than non­Hispanic
whites (P , 0.01), whereas hsCRP levels in
non­Hispanic blacks were not significantly
different than those in non­Hispanic
whites (P = 0.05). Amongmale participants
with MetS, there were nonsignificant
trends toward higher hsCRP levels in
non­Hispanic blacks (P = 0.07) and His-
panics (P = 0.08) than in non­Hispanic
whites. Among adolescent female partici-
pants with MetS, both non­Hispanic
blacks and Hispanics had higher levels
of hsCRP than those found in non­
Hispanic whites (P , 0.01 and P =
0.02, respectively). The difference in
hsCRP (as expressed by the ratio of geo-
metric means of hsCRP) between adoles-
cents with MetS and those without was
greater in non­Hispanic blacks than in
non­Hispanic whites (P = 0.04) but not

MetS and hsCRP in non­Hispanic black adolescents
higher than the difference in Hispanics
(P = 0.18) (Fig. 1C).
Correlations of hsCRP with
individual MetS components
One possible explanation for higher levels
of hsCRP among non­Hispanic black
adolescents with MetS is that hsCRP is
more tightly linked to the components
of MetS than is seen among other ethnic-
ities. Therefore, to evaluate qualitative re-
lationships between hsCRP and MetS
among each race/ethnicity and sex, we as-
sessed correlations of ln(hsCRP) with BMI
and individual MetS components (Table
3). With the exception of diastolic blood
pressure and fasting glucose, hsCRP was
significantly correlated with each of the
components of MetS in each of the sex/
ethnicity groups, with strengths of asso-
ciation that were similar between non­
Hispanic blacks and the other ethnicities.
Comparison of individual MetS
components among adolescents
with MetS
Another potential explanation for a
greater differential in hsCRP levels among
non­Hispanic black adolescents is that
non­Hispanic blacks may not be classi-
fied as having MetS until they have a
more developed condition. To investigate
this, we determined mean values for MetS
components among individuals with MetS,
along with the proportion above/below the
MetS-defining cutoffs of these components
(available in the Supplementary Materials).
Non­Hispanic black adolescents with
MetS had a higher BMI but not waist cir-
cumference than either other group. Non­
Hispanic blacks with MetS had a higher
mean systolic blood pressure than did His-
panics, and there was a higher prevalence
of hypertension among non­Hispanic
blacks with MetS than among either other
group. There were no other significant dif-
ferences in MetS components between
groups.
CONCLUSIONS--We report for the
first time that non­Hispanic-black ado-
lescents with MetS have higher levels of
hsCRP than non­Hispanic whites but not
Hispanics and have a greater differential
in hsCRP between individuals with MetS
and those without MetS. These data may
indicate that non­Hispanic black adoles-
cents with MetS have a more advanced
inflammatory condition than non­Hispanic
whites. Therefore, even though MetS has
a paradoxically low prevalence in non­
Hispanic blacks, MetS may be a particu-
larly good indicator of inflammation in
non­Hispanic black adolescents.
Although the value of MetS has
been challenged as an entity that is more
meaningful than the sum of its parts (23),
the associations between the individual
components of MetS are powerful, as is
the strong relationship between MetS
and systemic inflammation (2). Indeed,
inflammation is frequently cited as a key
etiologic factor in the development of the
individual components that comprise
MetS (2).
In our analysis of NHANES data, we
considered several explanations that
could contribute to the higher elevation
in hsCRP in non­Hispanic black adoles-
cents with MetS than in non­Hispanic
whites. First, there may be environmental
characteristics--such as socioeconomic
or educational differences (19)--that
could impact hsCRP levels differently by
race/ethnicity. To address these possibili-
ties, we included adjustment for house-
hold income, education, and smoking
status in our linear model (Table 2). Al-
though education and smoking were
clearly linked to hsCRP levels, adjusting
for differences in these covariates did not
eliminate the significant effect among
non­Hispanic blacks. Nevertheless, the
possibility of residual confounding can-
not be discounted because other factors
related to hsCRP and ethnicity could in
theory account for our findings.
A second possibility is that an elevated
degree of inflammation may represent a
unique feature of the processes underlying
MetS among non­Hispanic blacks--e.g.,
that non­Hispanic blacks exhibit an exag-
gerated production of inflammatory mark-
ers from adipose tissue or elsewhere. This
theory is plausible because there are many
characteristics of obesity and MetS that
manifest differently in non­Hispanic
blacks than in non­Hispanic whites and
Hispanics. The most striking of these eth-
nic differences relates to lower rates of dys-
lipidemia among non­Hispanic blacks
(5,6). Additionally, compared with non­
Hispanic whites, non­Hispanic blacks
have greater insulin resistance at similar
levels of adiposity (8,9) and less visceral
adiposity even after adjustment for total
fat and waist circumference (8,24). Non­
Hispanic blacks also have more subcutane-
ous fat than non­Hispanic whites and
more lean body mass per unit of body

between ethnic groups by corresponding MetS status are as follows: *P , 0.05 and **P , 0.01 vs.

weight (24). Also, compared with both
non­Hispanic white and Hispanic adoles-
cents, non­Hispanic blacks are less
likely to exhibit elevated fasting blood
glucose values (6) despite their higher
incidence of type 2 diabetes (10). There-
fore, the exaggerated levels of hsCRP
among adolescents with MetS may rep-
resent an additional unique feature of
MetS in non­Hispanic blacks.
Consequently, we analyzed linear re-
lationships between hsCRP and each of
the individual components of MetS. In all
three racial/ethnic groups, hsCRP corre-
lated similarly with each of the compo-
nents of MetS (Table 3), suggesting that
there are not qualitative differences in the
relationship between hsCRP and MetS
among non­Hispanic blacks. However,
the potential remains for more subtle var-
iation in the relationship between hsCRP
and the processes underlying MetS.
Finally, we investigated whether the
higher elevation in hsCRP among non­
Hispanic blacks with MetS is due to the
underclassification of MetS among non­
Hispanic black adolescents. It has been
well documented that non­Hispanic
blacks are classified as having MetS at far
lower rates than are seen among non­
Hispanic whites and Hispanics (5,6).
These low rates of MetS classification are
at odds with the greater degree of insulin
resistance (8,9) and high rates of type 2
diabetes and cardiovascular disease in
non­Hispanic blacks (10,11). One of the
most likely etiologies of the underclassifi-
cation of MetS is the relative absence of the
dyslipidemia of insulin resistance in non­
Hispanic blacks (7). Non­Hispanic blacks
have higher levels of HDL-cholesterol (a
protective cardiovascular disease factor)
during adolescence and lower levels of tri-
glycerides (a proatherogenic factor)
throughout the life span (5,6). Interest-
ingly, non­Hispanic blacks appear to
have lower baseline levels of triglycerides;
though these triglyceride levels increase
with worsening insulin resistance, they
are less likely to exceed currently used cut-
off values that are heavily influenced by the
normal range of triglycerides among non­
Hispanic whites (7). It is possible that by
the time a non­Hispanic black individual
exhibits triglyceride or HDL-cholesterol
abnormalities that exceed current limits
for MetS classification, he or she may al-
ready have a more advanced condition of
MetS that includeshigherhsCRPlevelsthan
those observed in non­Hispanic whites.

MetS and hsCRP in non­Hispanic black adolescents
MetS components among adolescents
classified as having MetS. In addition to
having more hypertension, non­Hispanic
black adolescents with MetS have a higher
BMI than the other groups. However, no
other racial/ethnic differences in MetS
components were detected. Hypertension
was not as significantly associated with
hsCRP levels (Table 3), leaving ethnic
differences in BMI as a potential explana-
tion for the elevated hsCRP levels in non­
Hispanic blacks with MetS. In many
ways, this is not surprising. BMI (and
waist circumference) carried by far the
strongest association with hsCRP in this
study (Table 3) and elsewhere (13), and
these relationships have been demon-
strated to be similarly strong among
non­Hispanic blacks and among non­
Hispanic whites and Hispanics (25).
The relationship between BMI and
hsCRP may relate to fat tissue mass (25).
Interestingly, for a given BMI and waist
circumference, non­Hispanic blacks
have less overall fat mass and more lean
mass than non­Hispanic whites (24). As a
result of data limitations within NHANES
1999­2008, it remains unclear whether
the higher BMI among non­Hispanic
black adolescents with MetS is due to
higher fat mass, higher lean mass, or both.
Nevertheless, racial/ethnic differences
in lean mass amount to approximately
3­4% of body weight, whereas the 10%
difference in BMI among non­Hispanic
blacks with MetS compared with other
racial/ethnic groups suggests an element
of increased fat tissue as well (24). Addi-
tionally, pubertal status is known to con-
tribute to insulin resistance and, overall,
occurs earlier in non­Hispanic blacks
than in other ethnicities. While pubertal
stage of subjects is not reported in NHANES
1999­2008, non­Hispanic white adoles-
cents with MetS tended to be older than
the other ethnicities (Supplementary Ma-
terials). Consequently, even though MetS
occurs at a lower rate in non­Hispanic
black adults than in non­Hispanic whites
or Hispanics, it cannot be ruled out that
pubertal differences play a role.
Notably, non­Hispanic black adoles-
cents with MetS did not have significantly
different levels of triglycerides or HDL-
cholesterol compared with the other
racial/ethnic groups (Supplementary Ma-
terials). This suggests that whereas pop-
ulation differences in lipid levels are
wide, non­Hispanic black adolescents
with MetS have levels of triglycerides
and HDL similar to those of other racial/
ethnic groups. While this may represent a
subset of non­Hispanic black adoles-
cents with a greater predisposition to-
ward dyslipidemia, these data also
support the hypothesis that non­
Hispanic black adolescents with MetS
have a more advanced condition--
potentially driven by a further degree
of obesity, as represented by BMI differ-
ences. This imbalance in the classification
of MetS has led the American Diabetes
Association and others (6,23) to call for
alternate sets of criteria for diagnosing
MetS. These alternate approaches could
include the use of race/ethnicity-specific
cutoff values for MetS components or de-
velopment of continuous criteria that add
up the degree of abnormality in each of the
individual components instead of requiring
a person to exceed cutoff values for a set
number of components. Use of such criteria
could result in the earlier classification of
MetS among at-risk adolescents.
In conclusion, the classification of
MetS confers a greater differential in
hsCRP levels among non­Hispanic black
adolescents than among non­Hispanic
whites but not among Hispanics. Though
the exact nature of the relationships be-
tween MetS, BMI, and hsCRP between
ethnicities remains unclear, these data
suggest a more advanced state of inflam-
mation in the setting of MetS among
non­Hispanic black adolescents than
among non­Hispanic whites, with one
possible etiology being a relatively more
severe condition of MetS. Given racial/
ethnic differences in the classification
of MetS using current criteria, there
remains a great need for specific diagnos-
tic tools to assess inflammation-related
and MetS-related risk among adolescents
of all racial/ethnic groups.
