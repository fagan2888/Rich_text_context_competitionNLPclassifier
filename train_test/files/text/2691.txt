ABSTRACT
Context: Up to 75% of skateboarders and snowboarders
admitted to the hospital sustain head injuries. It is unclear why
not all children and teenagers wear helmets while snowboarding
and skateboarding given the protection they afford.
Objectives:To report on the prevalence of, and factors associ-
ated with, skateboarding and snowboarding in injured children
and to explore factors that influence helmet use, head injury,
and hospitalization in this sample.
Design: A cross-sectional study of skateboard- and snow-
board-associated injuries from 2003 to 2012 among individuals
younger than age 18 years using National Electronic Injury Sur-
veillance System (NEISS) data from approximately 100 hospitals.
Main Outcome Measures: Helmet use, head injury, and
hospitalization.
Results: Of 1742 patients in the study, 852 (48.9%) and 890
(51.1%) were skateboarders and snowboarders, respectively.
Overall, 907 (52.1%) did not use helmets, and 704 (40.4%)
sustained head injuries. Multiple logistic regression analysis
showed that age, race/ethnicity, location of boarding, and engag-
ing in skateboarding influenced helmet use. Sex, race/ethnicity,
helmet use, and skateboarding predicted head injury. Age, sex,
skateboarding, and head injury predicted hospital admission.
Conclusion: Statistically significant differences exist in helmet
use, head injury, and hospitalization rates between skateboarders
and snowboarders. Our findings suggest that injury prevention
and outreach programs are needed to increase helmet use and
reduce the risk of head injury and hospitalization in skateboard-
ers and other at-risk groups. Further studies are needed to clarify
the association between race/ethnicity and helmet use among
skateboarders and snowboarders.
INTRODUCTION
Skateboarding and snowboarding have become more popu-
lar since the 1990s.1-4 According to 1998 data from the Con-
sumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury
Surveillance System (NEISS) and the National Sporting Goods
Association (NSGA) annual survey of nationally representative
households, the rate of skateboard-associated injuries seen in
Emergency Departments that required hospitalization was 2.9%
per 1000 for patients aged 7 years or older.4 The data also reveal
that the rate of skateboard-associated injuries declined from 1987
to 1993, but nearly doubled in 1998 to 8.9%. The most frequent
injuries among adolescent and young adult skateboarders include
ankle strain/sprain and wrist fracture.4 One study reports that the
"lower leg," ankle, and foot are the regions most severely affected
in skateboarding injuries.5 However, in other research, the propor-
tion of head injuries is reported as high as 75% among hospitalized
snow- and skateboarder patients,6 and the incidence is increasing.3,7
Although helmet use is known to provide protection against
head injury in snowboarding and skateboarding,7,8 not all "board-
ers" use them. One study, for instance, reports that only 13%
of skateboarders used helmets, jockstraps, and other protective
equipment.5 Other studies report that a considerable percentage
of children and teenagers (17% to 87%) do not use helmets when
boarding.5,9 Researchers have tried to identify factors that promote
helmet use in child and teenaged boarders, including helmet use
by parents9,10 and peers,7 and personal experience of a previous
head trauma injury.7 However, very little is known regarding fac-
tors that influence helmet use in skateboarders.
In this study, we aim to 1) report the prevalence of, and factors
associated with, skateboarding and snowboarding in injured chil-
dren and 2) explore factors influencing helmet use, head injury,
and hospitalization in this sample. Although both activities are
similar, the use of helmets in skateboarding has not been as aggres-
sively promoted as in snowboarding. We therefore hypothesized
that there are statistical differences in helmet use, head injury,
and hospitalization rates between skateboarders and snowboard-
ers. Our findings will help in designing and implementing spe-
cific public education and awareness efforts, and in determining
strategies to promote helmet use. This, in turn, will likely reduce
injury in these sports.

Factors Influencing Helmet Use, Head Injury, and Hospitalization Among Children Involved in Skateboarding and Snowboarding Accidents
METHODS
This cross-sectional study used data extracted from the NEISS.
The NEISS injury data are gathered from the Emergency Depart-
ments of approximately 100 geographically dispersed hospitals
throughout the US and its territories. They are selected as a
stratified probability sample of all 5000-plus US hospitals with
Emergency Departments. These hospitals have a minimum of 6
beds and provide 24-hour emergency services. Patient information
is collected from each NEISS hospital for every emergency visit
involving an injury associated with consumer products.
Snowboard- and skateboard-related injuries were identified by
the correlating NEISS product code for snowboards and skate-
boards, respectively. Data were collected during a 10-year period,
from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012. We included all
children (aged < 18 years), both boys and girls, who had helmet
status recorded in the comments section of the database. We
separated these children into 2 groups: age 12 years or younger,
and older than age 12 years, mainly to distinguish teenagers from
younger children, and because there were very few snow- and
skateboarders 4 years of age or younger. All medical records of
patients who sustained a skateboarding or snowboarding injury
during the study period were retrospectively reviewed. Date col-
lected included age, sex, race, location of boarding activity, body
part injured, presence or absence of head injury, need for hospi-
talization, and mortality.
To analyze the data, we used descriptive and 2 tests to first de-
scribe the overall characteristics of skate- and snowboarders in the
sample, and then to identify factors associated with helmet use,
head injury, and hospital admission. Next, we used adjusted logistic
regression to assess the independent role of skateboarding or snow-
boarding in predicting helmet use, head injury, and hospital admis-
sion, controlling for sex, age, race/ethnicity, and activity location.
Using NEISS weighted data, all analyses were performed
using the Predictive Analytics Software (PASW) statistics Ver-
sion 18.0 package (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals were calculated, and p values below 0.05
were considered statistically significant. This study was ap-
proved by our institutional review board and was conducted
in accordance with regulations established through the Dec-
laration of Helsinki.
RESULTS
Between January 2003 and December 2012, a total of 1742
patients were found who met study inclusion criteria. These
consisted of 1415 boys and 327 girls (M:F ratio = 4.3:1). Of the
overall sample of boarders, 852 (48.9%) and 890 (51.1%) were

Factors Influencing Helmet Use, Head Injury, and Hospitalization Among Children Involved in Skateboarding and Snowboarding Accidents
skateboarders and snowboarders, respectively; 907 (52.1%) of the
overall sample (n = 1742) did not use helmets, and 704 (40.4%)
suffered head injuries. Two deaths occurred, both in skateboard-
ers who did not use helmets.
As illustrated in Table 1, the skateboarder group contained a
higher percentage of boys (54.8%), children 12 years or younger
(53.7%), minorities (77.3%), those admitted to the hospital
(76.6%), those who used "other" sites (other than sports/recre-
ational parks) for boarding (94.4%), those who presented with
head injury (60.8%), and those who did not use helmets (68.6%).
Girls were mostly snowboarders, and snowboarders were mostly
teenager, white, less frequently admitted to the hospital, presented
with fewer "other" injuries, and used helmets (p > 0.05, Table 1).
Table 1, column 2, shows that helmet use was significantly
(p > 0.05) lower in skateboarders vs snowboarders, in boys vs girls,
in children older than age 12 years vs children age 12 years or
younger, and in racial and ethnic minorities (ie, African Ameri-
cans, Native Americans, Latinos, and Asians) vs whites. Helmet
use also was significantly lower in patients admitted to the hospital
vs those who were not, in those who boarded in "other" settings vs
sports/recreational parks, and in patients who sustained head injury
vs those who did not.Table 1 also shows that those with head injury
were significantly (p > 0.05) more likely to be skateboarders, boys,
ethnic minorities, admitted to the hospital, and to have boarded in
"other" locations.
Results of the adjusted logistic regression show that the like-
lihood of helmet use was significantly higher in children age
12 years or younger (odds ratio [OR] = 2.48), and in those
who boarded in sports/recreational parks (OR = 1.18). Racial/
ethnic minorities (OR = 0.84), skateboarders (OR = 0.28), and
those who sustained head injury (OR = 0.58) had lower odds
of using helmets (Table 2). Table 2 also reveals that male sex
(OR = 1.44), minority race/ethnicity (OR = 1.19), not wearing
a helmet (OR = 1.7), and engaging in skateboarding as opposed
to snowboarding (OR = 1.96) resulted in greater odds of head
injury, compared with female sex, white race, use of helmets, and
engaging in snowboarding. With respect to hospital admission,
our findings showed that boys (OR = 3.08), skateboarders (OR
= 2.54), and children who sustained head injuries (OR = 2.33)
were more likely to be hospitalized, whereas the likelihood of
hospital admission was lower in younger children (OR = 0.42)
compared with their older counterparts.
DISCUSSION
Skateboarding and snowboarding have become more popular
since the 1990s.1-4 In this study, we report on the prevalence
and characteristics of injured skateboarders and snowboarders,
and identify factors associated with helmet use, head injury, and
hospital admission in the sample. We found that nearly half of
the sample engaged in skateboarding. More than half did not
use helmets, and almost one in three experienced head injuries.
In the sample, skateboarders were mainly boys, older teenagers
and minorities, used "other" sites rather than sports/recreational
parks, sustained head injury, and did not use helmets.

Factors Influencing Helmet Use, Head Injury, and Hospitalization Among Children Involved in Skateboarding and Snowboarding Accidents
Our analysis reveals that, in those injured, the likelihood of hel-
met use was lower among skateboarders, racial/ethnic minorities,
and patients who sustained head injury, and higher in younger
children, and among those who used sports/recreational parks.
We also found that the probability of head injury was higher in
boys, skateboarders, racial/ethnic minorities, and patients who
did not use helmets, compared with girls, white, snowboarders
who used helmets. In terms of being hospitalized, boys were three
times more likely, skateboarders two and one-half times more
likely, and patients with head injury more than two times more
likely than their reference groups.
Some of these findings are in agreement with other studies that
have showed increased rates of injury among adolescent and young
adult skateboarders.2,4,6,10,11 As these activities continue to gain
popularity and the number of boarders increase, the incidence of
head injuries will also rise if further protective and educational steps
are not taken. Our findings suggest that greater efforts should be
directed toward identifying incentives that increase helmet use in
at-risk groups. Also, interventions that reinforce using helmets and
perhaps other personal protective equipment must be a priority.
Once informed about the benefits of helmet use and when
family and peers reinforce the routine use of protective gear,
teenagers are more likely to use them.7,9 Popular media has a
huge potential in promoting and disseminating safety messages
and changing safety perceptions in these groups, which can be
reinforced by primary care physicians.12 These issues and concerns
are of paramount importance, as we found no change in helmet
use from 2003 to 2012 (p = 0.20) in our sample (data not shown).
The higher incidence of helmet use at sports/recreation parks is
reported in previous studies6 and is probably because of an emphasis
on safety at these locations. Children who use sports and recreation-
al parks are usually required to use helmets as a condition of their
use. Usually this is a liability/insurance requirement. Nevertheless,
children and their parents should be educated about the substantial
risks and burden of injury associated with these activities, and with
not wearing a helmet. In our study, skateboarders were more likely
to be injured in other settings, including home or streets, where
helmet use warnings are not in place or are hard to enforce, which
warrants special precautions by their parents or guardians.
Racial/ethnic minorities had a lower likelihood of helmet use
and a higher probability of head injury and hospitalization. This
may stem from different shared attitudes and behaviors in safety
practices, precautions, and routines, which needs to be further
explored. Larger studies are also needed to substantiate our find-
ings in separate racial/ethnic groups. The nature of our data limits
our ability to perform such analyses.
Our research has several other limitations. Our data are only
from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2012. Moreover, we
can account only for helmet use in pediatric boarders who were
injured and whose helmet status have been recorded. Our sample
may therefore not be representative of the population we intend
to analyze because of selection bias. However, our findings are
purported to be generalizable, because NEISS estimates of con-
sumer product-related injuries for more than three decades attest
to the stability and rigor of their reporting over time in contrast
to a voluntary reporting system.13
CONCLUSION
A high proportion of skateboarders and snowboarders in our
study did not use helmets and sustained head injury. We also
found that skateboarders, teenagers, minorities, and those who
used places other than sports/recreational parks were significantly
less likely to use helmets. In addition, boys, racial/ethnic minori-
ties, those who did not use helmets, and skateboarders were more
likely to sustain a head injury. Engaging in skateboarding, not
wearing a helmet, and presenting with a head injury significantly
increased the odds of hospitalization. Publicity campaigns and
educational efforts may have led to a higher rate of helmet use in
snowboarders. This suggests that similar injury prevention and
outreach programs are needed for skateboarders to reduce head
injuries and hospitalization. v
