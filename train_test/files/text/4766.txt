Article
Self-esteem is one of the most frequently researched con-
cepts in psychology. There are variations in how self-
esteem is defined by scientists, but a common aspect is that
it refers to the positivity of a person's global evaluation of
the self (e.g., Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs,
2003). Many studies have investigated how self-esteem is
related to psychological and physical well-being (e.g.,
Baumeister et al., 2003; Diener, 1984; Myers & Diener,
1995) or social behavior (e.g., Leary, Tambor, Terdal, &
Downs, 1995; Taylor & Brown, 1988), which has contrib-
uted to a better understanding of human psychology and
behavior.
Temporal Changes in Self-Esteem in
the United States
Self-esteem has been investigated not only as a phenomenon
at a single point in time or over a short period of time but also
how it changes over the years. By investigating how psycho-
logical tendencies (e.g., self-esteem) change over time, we
can better understand how a culture/society changes over the
years and how socio-economic environments influence
human psychology and behavior (e.g., Twenge, 2015;
Twenge & Campbell, 2001).
Studies have described how self-esteem has changed over
the years in the United States. Twenge and Campbell (2001)
conducted a cross-temporal meta-analysis of studies that
used Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale (RSES; for a
review of cross-temporal meta-analysis, see Twenge, 2011).
Results showed that self-esteem increased among college
students in the United States between 1968 and 1994 (Twenge
& Campbell, 2001). In addition, they conducted the same
analysis on studies using the Coopersmith Self-Esteem
Inventory (SEI; Coopersmith, 1967) and showed that chil-
dren and early adolescents' self-esteem decreased from 1965
to about 1980, and then increased into the 1990s. Moreover,
Gentile, Twenge, and Campbell (2010) showed that self-
esteem increased among middle school, high school, and
college students between 1988 and 2008 by performing the
same type of analysis on RSES scores.

Losing Confidence Over Time: Temporal
Changes in Self-Esteem Among Older
Children and Early Adolescents in Japan,
1999-2006
Yuji Ogihara1,2, Yukiko Uchida1, and Takashi Kusumi1
Abstract
We examined temporal changes in self-esteem among elementary and middle school students in Japan. Previous research
has shown that self-esteem decreased among various sectors of the population, from middle school students to adults
between 1984 and 2010 in Japan. However, it was unclear whether such temporal changes are also present at earlier
stages of development (e.g., in elementary school) and in individual subgroups (e.g., each gender and developmental stage).
Identifying such boundary conditions of temporal change will contribute to a better understanding of how cultures change
over time. We analyzed representative and large-sample time-series data collected by the Japanese government in 1999 and
2006. Results showed that self-esteem decreased among elementary and middle school students regardless of gender and
developmental stage. We suggest that from an early stage of development and among a broad range of the population in
Japan, people's general self-evaluations became more negative between 1999 and 2006.

Temporal Changes in Self-Esteem in
Japan
Compared with the literature investigating the United
States, there has been little research on temporal changes in
self-esteem in other cultural contexts. In Japan, Oshio,
Okada, Mogaki, Namikawa, and Wakita (2014) investi-
gated temporal changes in self-esteem in Japan between
1984 and 2010. As in previous research (Gentile et al.,
2010; Twenge & Campbell, 2001), they conducted a cross-
temporal meta-analysis of articles published in peer-
reviewed Japanese journals that measured RSES. They
found that self-esteem decreased among both students
(middle school, high school, and college students) and
adults (aged 18 to 60, excluding college students) between
1984 and 2010 in Japan.1
The finding that self-esteem decreased in Japan over time
is intriguing and thought-provoking because it seems para-
doxical. It has been suggested that Japanese culture has
become more individualistic at least in some respects
(Hamamura, 2012; Ogihara, 2016b; Ogihara, Fujita, et al.,
2015; Ogihara, Uchida, & Kusumi, 2015). Given this, one
might expect Japanese people to have higher self-esteem.
This is because in individualistic societies, people have many
opportunities to interact with new people and to choose more
desirable relationships (e.g., Yuki & Schug, 2012).
Consequently, it is adaptive to have higher self-esteem in
individualistic cultures (Falk, Heine, Yuki, & Takemura,
2009; Zhang & Li, 2014). Indeed, this is the case in the
United States where culture has changed toward greater indi-
vidualism (e.g., DeWall, Pond, Campbell, & Twenge, 2011;
Greenfield, 2013; Twenge, Abebe, & Campbell, 2010;
Twenge, Campbell, & Gentile, 2012, 2013) and self-esteem
has gone up over time (Gentile et al., 2010; Twenge &
Campbell, 2001). Why this has not occurred in Japan may be
because, historically, Japan has not been an individualistic
culture. As a result, rapid changes toward individualism may
have caused people to experience conflicts and difficulties in
adapting to it (Ogihara & Uchida, 2014; Ogihara, Uchida, &
Kusumi, 2014).
However, the previous research in Japan did not suffi-
ciently examine temporal changes in self-esteem by sub-
group. To be clear, temporal changes in self-esteem by
developmental stage and gender were not fully investigated.
Identifying possible boundary conditions of the phenomenon
should be a key to revealing the question of why self-esteem
has decreased in East Asian cultures. We detail these limita-
tions and how they can be overcome below.
Temporal Changes in Self-Esteem by
Developmental Stage in Japan
The previous research (Oshio et al., 2014) has two limita-
tions. First, it leaves unclear whether self-esteem also
decreased in the segment of the population that is younger
than middle school age. The RSES was developed for people
in mid-to-late adolescence and has been administered mainly
to college students. When measuring the self-esteem of chil-
dren,scalesotherthanRSESareoftenused(e.g.,Coopersmith
SEI; Coopersmith, 1967; for details, seeTwenge & Campbell,
2001). As it was based on a cross-temporal meta-analysis of
the RSES, it is understandable that this research did not suf-
ficiently look at the pre-middle-school segment of the popu-
lation. However, it is important to identify from which
developmental stage temporal change emerges to uncover
the mechanisms or processes of cultural/societal change.
This logic is also found in research examining the develop-
mental stage from which cultural difference emerges. Prior
research has shown that cultural differences in certain psy-
chological and behavioral tendencies emerge after entering
elementary school (e.g., Duffy, Toriyama, Itakura, &
Kitayama, 2009; Imada, Carlson, & Itakura, 2013). This
implies that elementary school might be an important place
for the acquisition of cultural practices or values. Given that
self-esteem is essentially influenced by cultural factors (e.g.,
Heine, Lehman, Markus, & Kitayama, 1999; Schmitt &
Allik, 2005), declines in self-esteem should be found not
only for middle school students but also for elementary
school students. Hence, in this study, we examined whether
or not self-esteem among elementary school students also
decreased.
Second, it is not clear whether self-esteem decreased
among both middle and high school students, as the previous
research summed the average scores of middle schoolers and
high schoolers and analyzed them together (Oshio et al.,
2014). It is possible that only one of the two decreased while
the other remained constant, or that one of the two increased
slightly while the other decreased significantly. This combin-
ing of scores may have been necessitated by small sample
sizes (the total sample size was 39), which may be unavoid-
able because psychological research generally collects data
from university students (indeed, in their research, the sam-
ple size for university students was larger, k = 131). Moreover,
the authors noted that the interpretation of the result should
be taken with a grain of salt as the coefficient of determina-
tion in the regression analysis did not reach significance (R2
= .21, p = .09).
To overcome these two limitations, we examined tempo-
ral changes in self-esteem among elementary school students
and middle school students separately by analyzing time-
series archival data, which is methodologically different
from the previous research (cross-temporal meta-analysis).
Time-series data separate the population data into data about
different demographic groups, thus enabling a more detailed
look at temporal change in different segments of the popula-
tion. There are various approaches to tracing the psychology
and behavior of the past, each with its advantages and its
disadvantages (Kashima, 2014). By taking a different
approach to tracing temporal changes in culture/society, we
tried to compensate for the limitations of the previous
Ogihara et al. 3
cross-temporal meta-analysis, as multifaceted approaches
lead to a more valid and fruitful discussion. These comple-
mentary methods will thus advance the scientific under-
standing of the phenomenon.
Temporal Changes in Self-Esteem by
Gender in Japan
Just as it is important to examine temporal changes in self-
esteem according to developmental stage to identify bound-
ary conditions and gain a better understanding of the
underlying mechanisms or processes of cultural/social
changes, it is also important to look at these changes accord-
ing to gender. For example, if gender differences in self-
esteem decreased because scores in males remained stable
but scores in females increased, then the differences in how
the social environment has changed for each gender (e.g.,
relative increases in social power and status for females)
might be associated with this change.
Oshio et al. (2014) did not focus on temporal changes in
self-esteem by gender because the number of studies which
had reported average scores of RSES by gender was small,
and analysis by gender made the sample sizes smaller.
Instead, in a recent paper, they did examine whether gen-
der differences in self-esteem decreased in Japan over the
years (Okada, Oshio, Mogaki, Wakita, & Namikawa,
2015). They analyzed 50 studies published between 1982
and 2013 that reported RSES scores according to gender
and age demographics (from middle school students to the
elderly). They found that the average score for males was
higher than that for females, and that gender differences in
self-esteem in Japan had reduced slightly from the 1980s
to the 2010s (1980s: Hedges's g = .23, 1990s: g = .17,
2000s: g = .13).
However, this study (Okada et al., 2015) has two limita-
tions. First, although it indicated that overall gender differ-
ences decreased over time, it did not break down these
temporal changes in self-esteem for each gender.
Specifically, there are three plausible types of temporal
change that can account for the fact that male scores were
higher than female scores and the overall reduction in the
difference between genders: (a) the average male score has
decreased greatly whereas the average female score has
increased slightly, (b) the average male score has decreased
whereas the average female score has not changed, and (c)
the average scores both for males and females has decreased
but the magnitude of change was larger for males than for
females. How we interpret the overall decrease in the differ-
ences between the genders will differ depending on which
type of change underlies it. If we find gender differences in
the type of change, we can identify some of the socio-cul-
tural changes that affect self-esteem. Thus, to understand
how Japanese culture and people have changed, it is desir-
able to look at temporal changes in self-esteem according to
gender.
A second limitation of the past study is that it did not
break down temporal changes in gender difference in self-
esteem by developmental stage (Okada et al., 2015). The pre-
vious study calculated gender difference over time by
analyzing the RSES scores of all developmental stages (from
middle school students to the elderly) together. Hence, the
finding that there has been temporal decline in gender differ-
ences may have resulted from decreases in the ratio of
research on younger generations, which yield larger gender
differences (Okada et al., 2015; Orth, Trzesniewski, &
Robins, 2010). Because few (or no) studies have examined
self-esteem at each stage of development particularly long
ago, the investigation of temporal changes in self-esteem by
developmental stage is difficult or impossible because of
cross-temporal meta-analysis's dependence on past research.
As noted above, most research collected data from university
students, so there is little research collecting data from
younger and older segments of the population (e.g., middle
school students and the elderly) than university students,
especially long ago. Thus, the investigation of temporal
changes in gender differences in self-esteem according to
developmental stage is difficult.
An analysis of time-series data can also overcome these
two limitations because it basically focuses on specific popu-
lations over time. Hence, in this study, we looked at temporal
changes in self-esteem among elementary and middle school
students by gender and developmental stage.
Present Research
In addition to the limitations raised above, there is a further
limitation to previous research (Oshio et al., 2014) in terms
of sampling. Previous research was based on scores from
past studies, which makes it difficult to determine whether
the samples for each study were representative of the specific
populations for the years they represent. For example, an
average self-esteem score obtained from students at one mid-
dle school in 1990 might have been used as the overall aver-
age self-esteem score for middle school students in Japan in
1990. Thus, it is possible that the temporal changes in self-
esteem may actually be regional differences due to the use of
different regional populations for different studies' samples.
To insist that self-esteem has decreased among some popula-
tions in Japanese society/culture, it is desirable to measure
self-esteem using more representative samples. Thus, in the
current research, we investigated temporal changes in self-
esteem by analyzing time-series data that are both more rep-
resentative and come from a large sample.
In summary, previous research did not examine how tem-
poral changes in self-esteem may vary according to develop-
mental stage or gender. Moreover, it was based on data for
which the representativeness of the samples is unclear.
Therefore, in the present research, we examined temporal
changes in self-esteem by developmental stage (elementary
school and middle school students) and gender by analyzing

a large sample of time-series data that are more representa-
tive of the population.
Method
Data
We analyzed representative and large-sample time-series
data collected by the Japanese government (Cabinet Office,
Government of Japan, 2000, 2007). Data collection was con-
ducted twice, in 1999 and in 2006. The purpose of these sur-
veys was to capture values, lifestyle patterns, and beliefs
among elementary and middle school students in Japan.
Respondents
The respondents were students in elementary school (fourth,
fifth, and sixth grade: aged 9 to 12 years) and middle school
(seventh, eighth, and ninth grade: aged 12 to 15 years) in
Japan. The government collected data from all over Japan
using a multistage random sampling method (in 1999: 250
locations with a response rate of 74.8%, in 2006: 200 loca-
tions with a response rate of 59.5%). Data were gathered
from all 47 prefectures,2 from four sizes of municipality (big
city, mid-sized city, small city, and village), and from both
genders, making these surveys more representative. The
sample sizes were indicated in Table 1. A total of 2,180 ele-
mentary school students and 2,206 middle school students
participated in the surveys.
Question Items
In the surveys, participants reported to what extent the sen-
tence "I have self-confidence in myself 3" applied to them-
selves by using 4-point scale (1 = applies, 2 = somewhat
applies, 3 = does not apply very much, 4 = does not apply).
In the 1999 survey, the anchors also included "5 = do not
know," so to compare the results from 1999 and 2006, we
excluded participants who chose this anchor (the rate of such
participants was low: 5.4% boys and 3.5% girls in elemen-
tary school, 1.6% boys and 2.4% girls in middle school). For
ease of interpretation (i.e., higher scores indicate higher self-
esteem), we reversed the scores and subtracted 1 (i.e., 0 =
does not apply, 1 = does not apply very much, 2 = somewhat
applies, 3 = applies).
Results
Temporal Changes in Self-Esteem by Gender and
School Level
The average scores of self-esteem by gender and school level
in 1999 and 2006 are shown in Figure 1. We conducted a
three-way ANOVA with gender (boy or girl), school level
(elementary school or middle school) and year (1999 or
2006) as between-subject factors.
We found significant main effects for gender, F(1,
4307) = 110.91, p < .001, 
p
2 = .03; school level, F(1, 4307)
= 138.99, p < .001, 
p
2 = .03; and year, F(1, 4307) = 98.68,
p < .001, 
p
2 = .02. Self-esteem for boys (M =1.52, SD = .90)
was higher than that for girls (M = 1.25, SD = .86; d = .31),
which was consistent with previous research (e.g., Feingold,
1994, Kling, Hyde, Showers, & Buswell, 1999; Okada et al.,
2015).
Self-esteem for students in elementary school (M =1.53,
SD = .90) was higher than that for students in middle
school (M = 1.24, SD = .85; d = .34), which was also con-
sistent with prior research showing that self-esteem
decreases in the teen years (e.g., Ogihara, 2016a; Robins,
Trzesniewski, Tracy, Gosling, & Potter, 2002; Twenge &
Campbell, 2001).
Most importantly, self-esteem in 2006 (M = 1.26, SD =
.89) was significantly lower than that in 1999 (M = 1.51, SD
= .87; d = .28).4 No two-way interactions or three-way inter-
action were significant (Fs < .91, ps > .34, 
p
2 s < .01).
Therefore, self-esteem decreased from 1999 to 2006, regard-
less of gender and school level.
The reason why the 2006 self-esteem scores were lower
than 1999 scores might be due to the lack of an option for
"do not know" in 2006 because people who wanted to choose
"do not know" might have chosen more modest answers in
2006, given the prevalence of modesty norm in Japan (e.g.,
Tafarodi, Shaughnessy, Yamaguchi, & Murakoshi, 2011). In
this case, such answers would be "1: does not apply very
much" or "2: somewhat applies," because "0: does not apply"
and "3: applies" are more assertively clear (i.e., it would be
unusual for someone wishing to answer "do not know" to
choose a clear answer) and previous research has shown that
Japanese tend to avoid extreme answers in Likert-type scales
(e.g., Chen, Lee, & Stevenson, 1995). So, we re-calculated
the 1999 average scores as if all those who chose "do not

know" answered "1: does not apply very much," which is the
lowest possible score in this hypothetical situation.
The modified average scores for each subgroup in 1999
were 1.78 (0.04 lower than the original score; SD = 0.87)
for elementary school boys, 1.48 (0.01 lower than the orig-
inal score; SD = 0.83) for elementary school girls, 1.49
(0.01 lower than the original score; SD = 0.84) for middle
school boys, and 1.23 (identical to the original score; SD =
0.80) for middle school girls. We then conducted an analy-
sis that was identical to the initial one, and the results of
the analyses were consistent. We found significant main
effects for gender, F(1, 4378) = 107.72, p < .001, 
p
2 = .02,
identical to the original effect size; school level, F(1, 4378)
= 131.51, p < .001, 
p
2 = .03, identical to the original effect
size; and year, F(1, 4378) = 87.05, p < .001, 
p
2 = .02,
identical to the original effect size. Self-esteem for boys
(M =1.51, SD = .89) was higher than that for girls (M =
1.24, SD = .85; d = .31; identical to the original effect
size). Self-esteem for students in elementary school (M
=1.52, SD = .89) was higher than that for students in mid-
dle school (M = 1.23, SD = .84; d = .33; .01 lower than the
original effect size). Most importantly, self-esteem in 2006
(M = 1.26, SD = .89) was significantly lower than that in
1999 (M = 1.49, SD = .86; d = .27; .01 lower than the origi-
nal effect size). No two-way interactions or three-way
interaction were significant (Fs < 1.25, ps > .26, 
p
2 s < .01;
identical to the original effect size).5
Thus, we found that the results were consistent with those
in the original analysis, though the effects became slightly
weaker. This weak effect might be because the proportion of
people who chose "do not know" was relatively small.
Therefore, although a minor portion of the decrease might be
explained by the difference in anchors, we still found self-
esteem decreases from 1999 to 2006.
Temporal Changes in Gender Differences
Although the three-way interaction was not significant, to
examine whether gender differences reduced over time, we
calculated effect sizes for gender differences among elemen-
tary school and middle school students at each time point.
We found that the gender difference slightly decreased
among elementary schoolers (d = .38 in 1999, d = .26 in
2006), whereas it was fairly stable among middle schoolers
(d = .32 in 1999, d = .34 in 2006).
We also conducted an analysis that was identical to the
initial one as if all those who chose "do not know" answered
"1: does not apply very much," which is the lowest possible
score in the hypothetical situation, and the results of the anal-
yses were consistent. We found that the gender difference
slightly decreased among elementary schoolers (d = .35 in
1999, .03 lower than the original effect size; d = .26 in 2006),
whereas it was fairly stable among middle schoolers (d = .32
in 1999, identical to the original effect size; d = .34 in 2006).
Discussion
In this study, we examined temporal changes in self-esteem
among elementary and middle school students in Japan by
analyzing representative and large-sample time-series data.
Past research has shown that self-esteem decreased across
the population, from middle school students to adults in
Japan between 1984 and 2010 (Oshio et al., 2014). However,
temporal changes in self-esteem by developmental stage
were not sufficiently examined. Specifically, it was not evi-
dent whether decreases in self-esteem were also present
among elementary school students. We found that elemen-
tary school students' self-esteem decreased between 1999
and 2006, which extends the existing literature (Oshio et al.,

2014). This finding is consistent with previous research
showing cultural differences emerge after entering school
(Duffy et al., 2009; Imada et al., 2013), implying that ele-
mentary school might be an important cultural factor.
Moreover, it was unclear whether or not self-esteem declined
for both middle school and high school students. Our study
indicated that at least middle school students' self-esteem
declined between 1999 and 2006, which confirms and sup-
plements the previous literature (Oshio et al., 2014). These
findings suggest that from a very early stage of development,
people's general evaluations of the self became more nega-
tive in Japan between 1999 and 2006.
Our research also extends previous findings by investigat-
ing changes in self-esteem by gender. Prior research indi-
cated that gender difference in self-esteem in Japan became
slightly smaller from the 1980s to the 2000s (Okada et al.,
2015). Yet, they did not show how the average scores for
each gender changed over this time span. Our results indi-
cated that self-esteem went down for both boys and girls,
showing that across a broad range of the population, people's
global self-evaluations declined over the years. Among ele-
mentary school students, the slope of the decrease for girls
was slightly more moderate than that for boys, which lead to
a modest reduction in gender differences (d = .12). This
result is consistent with previous research showing that gen-
der differences became slightly smaller over time (Okada
et al., 2015). In contrast, gender differences among middle
school students were stable between 1999 and 2006.
Furthermore, by analyzing the more representative time-
series data, we overcame the limitation of possibly non-rep-
resentative samples found in previous studies (Okada et al.,
2015; Oshio et al., 2014). In cross-temporal meta-analyses,
samples might not actually be representative of the popula-
tion at specific time especially in the past. In contrast, time-
series surveys basically aim to grasp the psychological or
behavioral characteristics of more representative population.
Considering that each approach has its advantages and its
disadvantages (Kashima, 2014), it is desirable to look at tem-
poral changes in culture/society with multiple approaches.
As a result, our findings were consistent with the previous
studies (Okada et al., 2015; Oshio et al., 2014), supplement-
ing and extending the previous literature.
Taken together, we found that self-esteem decreased
among older children and early adolescents regardless of
developmental stage and gender. Thus, we suggest that from
a very early stage of development and among a broad range
of the population, people's general evaluation of the self
became more negative between 1999 and 2006 in Japan.
One may be skeptical about concluding that self-esteem
decreased between 1999 and 2006 based on data from two
points in time. These findings might have been affected by
random errors, wherein it was only by chance that the scores
in 1999 were high and the scores in 2006 were low. However,
looking at data from other years, we do not think that this is
the case. Compared with the self-esteem scores from other
years between 1984 and 2010, the scores from 1999 and
2006 do not seem exceptional or appear to be outliers (Oshio
et al., 2014). This is also the case for each generational group
(ages from 20s to 60s) in other datasets (Ogihara, Uchida, &
Kusumi, 2016). Considering these findings together, it is
highly unlikely that the 1999 and 2006 scores were outliers
or occurred by chance. Hence, we think that the conclusion
that self-esteem decreased between 1999 and 2006 is valid.
Limitations and Future Directions
Our study found that self-esteem decreased among elemen-
tary and middle school students between 1999 and 2006. But
this is a relatively short span of time (i.e., 8 years). This is
due to the difficulty of collecting older data in Japan (Ogihara,
2015; Ogihara, Fujita, et al., 2015) compared to in the United
States (e.g., Gentile et al., 2010; Twenge & Campbell, 2001).
Although, based on previous findings, it is estimated that the
decline spanned from the 1980s into the 2010s (Ogihara
et al., 2016; Oshio et al., 2014), it is desirable to examine
temporal changes in self-esteem among elementary and mid-
dle school students over a longer span of time.
It should also be explored in the future why self-esteem
has decreased among a broad range of people in Japan.
Although we addressed possible explanations to this question
in the introduction, the issue remains unclear. To answer this
question, given that number of studies that describe temporal
changes in self-esteem in Japan is small, it would be desirable
to clarify the details of these changes. Specifically, finding
their boundary conditions (e.g., time period, subgroup, and
area) could also contribute to answering this question.

Notes
1. Decreases in self-esteem between 1996 and 2009 may have
occurred broadly in East Asia, as there is evidence that it also
occurred in China during this period (Liu & Xin, 2015).
2. Prefectures are Japanese subnational jurisdictions that are big-
ger than cities and towns. A prefecture is similar to states in the
United States.

3. The original wording in Japanese is "
[jibun ni jishin ga aru]." In this research, we regard self-con-
fidence as almost identical to the concept of self-esteem. We
have two reasons for this. First, self-confidence is regarded as
an important component of self-esteem (e.g., Schmitt & Allik,
2005; Tafarodi & Milne, 2002). When self-esteem is defined
as the positivity of a person's global evaluation of the self (e.g.,
Baumeister et al., 2003), self-confidence also fits this defini-
tion. In the Rosenberg's (1965) Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), "I
am able to do things as well as most other people." or "I feel I
do not have much to be proud of. (reverse-scored)" are items
that reflect the aspect of self-competence. It is difficult to pre-
dict how self-esteem and self-confidence might differ in their
patterns of temporal change. Second, by using the existing
literature on self-esteem, we can discuss temporal changes in
Japan in more detail. To our knowledge, there was no research
examining temporal changes in self-confidence in Japan.
4. Although no interaction effects were found, to compare
the degrees of temporal changes with those found in other
research, we report the effect sizes of temporal changes
for each subgroup. The effect sizes for boys at elementary
school, girls at elementary school, boys at middle school,
and girls at middle school were ds = .32, .22, .32, and .35,
respectively.
5. The effect sizes of temporal changes for boys at elementary
school, girls at elementary school, boys at middle school, and
girls at middle school were ds = .27 (.05 lower than the origi-
nal effect size), .21 (.01 lower than the original effect size), .31
(.01 lower than the original effect size), and .34 (.01 lower than
the original effect size), respectively.
