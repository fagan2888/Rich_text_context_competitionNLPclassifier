Introduction
Workplace abuse has been described as behaviors directed at
an employee, with the intent to harm him or her. It negatively
affects the person's work and occurs regularly, over a period of
time (Einarsen, Hoel, Zapf, & Cooper, 2011). In those individ-
uals targeted for abuse, cross-sectional studies report depres-
sion, difficulty sleeping, and symptoms of burnout (Nielsen &
Einarsen, 2012). In terms of consequences for employers, these
behaviors have been associated with employee absenteeism,
illness, legal and medical costs, early retirement, and general
workplace instability (Hershcovis & Barling, 2010). Boddy,
Miles, Sanyal, and Hartog (2015) find that employees in bully-
ing situations tended to arrive late for work, leave early, and
take longer breaks.
It seems obvious that bullying behavior in the workplace not
only affects the mental and physical health of a targeted indi-
vidual employee, but also threatens the stability and productiv-
ity of other employees, at a significant economic cost to the
employer, in terms of workman's compensation, lowered
morale, and employee turnover (Aubé & Rousseau, 2014;
Houschman, O'Reilly, Robinson, & Wolff, 2012; Mawritz
et al., 2012). It is imperative to better understand how this kind
of damage is inflicted in the workplace, to ameliorate it. This
articleproposesatheoreticalmodel,drawnfromrecentresearch
in neuroscience and from relevant discussions in clinical psy-
chology, that identify the various members of a bullying mob
and their motives for participation in workplace abuse.
Neuroscientists concerned with the nature of social intel-
ligence, or what is referred to as empathic capacity, find that
it is normally distributed in the general population (Baron-
Cohen, 2011). The literature concerned with this research
suggests that those who will engage in bullying or abusing a
fellow employee are found at the extreme lower end of this
distribution, while targeted employees are found at the higher
end (Namie & Namie, 2009). When the discussions presented
by clinical psychologists are reviewed, the various roles
played by participants in workplace abuse become clear.
The following discussion presents an explanatory account
that suggests that workplace bullying does not occur as a
response to normal difficulties in social interactions, nor
does it have to involve public displays of aggression and
obvious bullying behaviors. The harm visited on a competent
employee is the result of a zero-empathy organizer who
directs stealth attacks, with an intention to increase the tar-
get's stress, reduce their social status, and create the condi-
tions for their possible exit from the workplace.

tress and anguish to a workplace associate, to the extent that

Social Intelligence and the Explanation
of Workplace Abuse
Jerome Popp1
Abstract
Bullying in the workplace by management-level supervisors and executives has been well documented in the literature;
however, bullying of employees by their associates is often less noticeable, even stealth, and has been understudied. This
article presents a theoretical model that draws from the literature of clinical psychology and recent research in neuroscience
to identify and describe the four different roles played in employee workplace colleague abuse. These roles include (1)
the leader of the abuse, (2) the targeted employee, (3) members of the mob who bully the targeted employee under the
direction of the abuse leader, and (4) participants in a whisper campaign. To understand the motivations of employees who
intentionally cause an associate distress or illness, it is necessary to understand these distinct roles.

he or she becomes physically ill, resigns, or, in extreme
cases, commits suicide (Nielsen, Nielsen, Notelaers, &
Einarsen, 2015). Neuroscientists distinguish between (a)
general intelligence, which consists of reasoning and mem-
ory, and (b) social intelligence, or empathic capacity, which
gives us compassion and a conscience. These two forms of
intelligence are supported in different areas of the brain
(Lieberman, 2013). General intelligence is located on the lat-
eral surface of the brain, while social intelligence is found on
the medial or midline region. Given that the two intelligences
are supported by distinct brain areas, it is possible, for exam-
ple, that a person could be high in one form of intelligence
and low in the other, or high or low in both.
Employees with high social intelligence, that is, highly
empathic individuals, more easily understand what other
people are thinking and their intentions, what neuroscientists
refer to as mindreading or mentalizing. Some employees are
better than others at understanding or interpreting the com-
ments or intentions of those with whom they interact. They
are also better at understanding the emotional states of oth-
ers, a skill referred to as affect matching. Lieberman also
includes empathic motivation, the impetus to assist another
in distress or to recognize another's success, as a third char-
acteristic of highly empathic people.
An important point for the study of workplace abuse is
that individuals at the extreme lower end of the distribu-
tion of social intelligence have no conscience and are inca-
pable of experiencing shame or remorse. This means that
there are no limits on their behavior, beyond that of self-
protection. It should be recognized that the presence or
absence of a conscience is an important division in the
human population, one that is more important in under-
standing the differences in people we encounter than is
general intelligence, race, or gender (Stout, 2005). This
division is especially important in understanding work-
place abuse. The idea of a lack of a conscience, or signifi-
cantly below average social intelligence, is fundamental to
understanding all forms of human cruelty (Baron-Cohen,
2011). Individuals in any corporation or social institution
should not assume that their workplace is free of individu-
als with no conscience, those who have no limits on their
behavior. On average, there is one zero-empathy individ-
ual in every group of 25 (Stout, 2005).
A benefit of this research is that the terminological issue
of how to refer to these zero-empathy individuals is simpli-
fied, at least for purposes of understanding workplace abuse.
Babiak and Hare (2006) conceptually distinguish psychopa-
thy, sociopathy, and antisocial personality disorder (APD).
They posit psychopathy as biologically based, but sociopa-
thy as a learned condition. Stout considers sociopaths as hav-
ing no conscience and, consequently, having no limits on
their behavior, other than avoiding a context that would
reduce their ability to do what they please and feel no respon-
sibility or obligation to anyone except themselves. Boddy
preferred the term psychopath (Boddy, 2005, 2011a, 2011b).
There seems to be little agreement on the definitions of these
terms in the literature.
For clinical diagnoses of individuals and their treatment,
the various classifications of these disorders are important,
but for an explanation of workplace abuse, the classification
of zero-empathy allows us to understand the basic physio-
logical nature of employees who attack other employees,
with the intent to cause them serious harm. These individuals
lack the biological underpinnings of what makes us social
creatures (Lieberman, 2013). They are found most com-
monly in positions that give them unsupervised control over
a small group of somewhat vulnerable individuals, where
they can behave as they wish, without accountability (Stout,
2005) and (Babiak & Hare, 2006). Both Lieberman and
Baron-Cohen report that zero-empathy individuals are char-
acterized by schadenfreude, the German word for enjoying
the pain or distress experienced by others.
As Stout (2005) observes, these individuals are unable to
process emotional experience, except when this experience
can be coldly intellectual. Although it is not possible to scan
the brains of employees thought to be of zero empathy and
who enjoy inflicting pain on others, the reality is that in prin-
ciple these problem employees are identifiable, which means
that these analyses are related to an objective reality, not sim-
ply opinions about someone's behavior.
Leaders of Abuse
At the extreme lower end of the social intelligence distribu-
tion, we find individuals with zero social intelligence who
are capable of extremely negative treatment of others. At the
positive end of this distribution are those characterized by a
hypersensitivity to the mental and emotional states of other
people. When zero-empathy employees first enter the work-
place, they sort other employees into four categories: (1)
those who are competent and productive; (2) those who can
be induced to take part in the abuse of a targeted employee;
(3) those who are attracted to, and find enjoyment in gossip
about coworkers; and (4) those who are irrelevant to their
plans and methods. Individuals targeted for abuse are those
who stand out as more respected, intelligent, popular, com-
petent, or attractive (Stout, 2005). The presence of these
employees in the workplace is offensive to zero-empathy
employees, which leads them to seek what Stout refers to as
existential vengeance. By hypothesis, employees targeted for
abuse are those at the higher end of the social intelligence
curve. Conscientious, and well-liked, they are generally con-
cerned when someone else is in pain or distress. Within any
group, these employees will have a slightly higher social
status.
Anyone whose behavior is not limited by a conscience
learns early in life that when individuals lose friends, for
whatever reason, it is significantly distressing for them.
Considerable research supports the fact that the three greatest
sources of stress are (a) low social status, (b) lack of friends,
Popp 3
and (c) childhood stress (Wilkinson & Pickett, 2009). If the
employees targeted for abuse can be made to feel rejection
by their associates, they will experience despair that can lead
to anguish and depression.Asecondary objective is to reduce
the amount and quality of the employee's work, so that they
are passed over for recognitions or special assignments. The
unrecognized superiority of the zero-empathy employee is
demonstrated to everyone, when it is seen that these respected
employees can be reduced in status and shown to be less than
others think. In their ability to bring down more socially
desirable individuals and productive workers, they prove
their power over all others, which, as it turns out, is remark-
ably easy to accomplish.
Members of the Mob
The leaders of workplace abuse surround themselves with
employees who are either somewhat insecure in their posi-
tions, or who are themselves without a conscience (McGregor
& McGregor, 2013; Stout, 2005). Literature that describes
mobbing reveals multiple participants in the abuse of an
employee (Davenport, Schwartz, & Elliott, 1999; Duffy &
Sperry, 2012). The clinical literature describes the motivation
of individuals who will participate in the infliction of harm on
a fellow employee and reports that these individuals can be
organized and directed by a leader, which is consistent with
the basic account of workplace abuse (Babiak & Hare, 2006).
These are persons who are apathetic and willing to follow a
leader who can protect them, because they lack self-confi-
dence and tend to avoid conflict (McGregor & McGregor,
2013). Employees new to the job may find that they are poorly
prepared for, or dislike the tasks required of them. These
employees are readily identified by the leader of the abuse.
In situations where employees are subjected to explicit
evaluations, these individuals may seek protection by joining
the leader, with the belief that this person is in control of the
workplace. They may also see the power of the leader, referred
to by Babiak and Hare (2006) as a puppetmaster, and fear
becoming a target themselves (Maarit & Vartia, 2001; Namie
& Lutgen-Sandvik, 2010). The McGregors further hypothe-
size that some of these individuals may bear a grudge, be jeal-
ous or angry, or feel let down in some way by the person
receiving the abuse. They become followers in employment
situations that afford the zero-empathy employee undersuper-
vised control over others, especially those who seek a para-
sitic lifestyle (Babiak & Hare, 2006; Stout, 2005).
People have a basic sensitivity to their relative standing in
a group, which is a powerful motivator of their behavior
(Wohlforth, 2009). When individuals lose friends and experi-
ence lowered status, the stress the zero-empathy employee
wants to create is achieved. Those targeted experience even
greater stress when they can no longer enjoy exercising their
skills and competence in the workplace. This occupational
stress is incomprehensible to the abuse leaders, because the
workplace for them is a field of play, a place where they can
demonstrate their superior powers to themselves and others.
With no conscience, they find no pride in doing something
well; they will never be seen as hard workers, because their
attention and energies are directed elsewhere. They stand to
gain in social status if the targeted person is driven from the
workplace or is discredited.
Low social status individuals who reject participation in
the abuse leader's activities may have already achieved com-
pensation in the form of resource exchange, by engaging in
other institutional activities in which they see themselves as
having a higher status. Examples of such exchanges might
involve increased participation in church activities, commu-
nity groups, family relationships, sports, or recreational pas-
times. In these activities, individuals can prove they are
valued by others, evidence sought to fortify their own value
as a person (Henry, 2007).
Participants in a Whisper Campaign
A method of employee abuse more effective than bullying is
removing an employee's friends and lowering his or her social
status with a whisper campaign. Zero-empathy employees are
alert for, and intensely cultivate, those employees who will
enthusiastically participate in gossiping. Determining how
employees respond to gossip is part of the zero-empathy
employee's initial sorting process mentioned earlier. Those
found to be eager listeners or contributors become active par-
ticipants in the campaign against a targeted individual. The
whisper campaign is an endless activity; the abuser's schaden-
freude from gossip is pursued any time another person will
listen. This is similar to the saturation technique used in adver-
tising, and eventually seems to influence, perhaps sublimi-
nally, many employees' views of the targeted individual.
Babiak and Hare (2006) warn that an employee's reputation
can be destroyed without his or her awareness that anyone
would have doubts about the employee's character or compe-
tence. The victim of a whisper campaign can be reenvisioned
as a "problem employee," without their knowledge.
Content for the campaign is obtained in two basic ways.
Negative comment fishing is the technique of initiating a
conversation with a targeted employee and then mentioning
another employee's name. The zero-empathy employee will
make negative comments about that employee, hoping to
entice the targeted employee to follow the lead and say
something negative also. The targeted employee may respond
with an innocuous comment or nod in agreement about a tan-
gential matter. The other employee is then told of what was
said and who said it. Note that the zero-empathy employee is
in no way inhibited from enhancing what was said by the
targeted employee.
Other effective techniques for demeaning a colleague
might include the creation of a derogatory name for the per-
son targeted for removal. These may include, but are not lim-
ited to, negative descriptors of physical appearance or
behavior that implies the target is deficient in some way or
4 SAGE Open
does not fit within the values of the workplace, and is thus
deserving of scorn. Abuse leaders usually float a derogatory
name within the group to see who will embrace it enthusias-
tically. A person can become vilified simply by the zero-
empathy employee's repeated use of an unflattering label.
A source of stress beyond those mentioned by Wilkinson
and Pickett (2009) is the devastation competent persons
experience when they observe incompetent employees
rewarded or recognized as a part of their compensation for
mob membership. They also experience great stress when
they observe respected former colleagues obediently follow-
ing the demands of a puppetmaster. Other employees, who
are currently not being bullied, live in fear of being the next
target, and report higher stress levels and intentions to leave
than nonexposed workers (Emdad, Alipour, Hagberg, &
Jensen, 2012). These situations are especially troubling when
local political maneuverings are given a higher priority than
the services and products provided to customers or clients.
On a strictly humanitarian level, this deterioration of work-
place atmosphere and harm to competent individuals should
be of concern, but there is a financial cost to companies as
well. A study by Fattori et al. (2015) estimated the economic
cost of bullying to employers in terms of losses in productiv-
ity as upward from 15%.
When incompetent employees become members of a
mob, the quality of their work often deteriorates even further.
Under the protection of the zero-empathy employee, even
the feeblest of striving seems unnecessary. More serious is
the decline in work quality of the targeted employee, who is
often driven into depression by mobbing activities. Other
employees who observe this diminishing of quality through-
out their workplace also experience increased stress, which
has an impact on job satisfaction and the quality of their
work. Boddy (2011) found that 26% of the bullying was
explained by 1% of the work population. One percent of the
employees in a company can emotionally and healthwise
impact a quarter of the employees. The work of many others
may be affected as they sense the anguish of their fellow
workers. (Namie & Namie, 2009)
While a business, corporation, or any institution, may not
be destroyed by employees with no conscience and their
minions, their presence most assuredly means the institution
or organization is underperforming its potential. As noted,
researchers estimate the percentage of these individuals in
the population at one in 25, but as Babiak and Hare (2006)
suggest, they will control a number of other employees.
When participants in the whisper campaign are included in
the abuse mobs, a high percentage of the workforce could be
involved in the abuse of the better employees.
In a Forbes interview (Asghar, 2013), Martha Stout
observed that having a sociopath as an employee can be
expensive, in terms of its eventual cost to an organization.
Zero-empathy employees may be immune from organiza-
tional discipline because they have control of a significant
group of employees. Moreover, they may also protect their
followers from discipline, which means that they also do not
have to perform to retain their positions, and the overall qual-
ity of the work product declines significantly. Employees
who readily support the leader's activities may not reveal
antisocial attitudes, but neither do they display moral charac-
ter or professional responsibility.
Consequences for Targeted Employees
Targeted employees are empathic individuals, who are, by
nature, constant monitors of how they are perceived by those
with whom they interact. This renders them more vulnerable
than average to the devastation of these attacks (Namie &
Namie, 2009). They may wonder whether those who partici-
pate in their mobbing sensed a judgment that they were weak
employees, and that this judgment has somehow been recog-
nized by the attackers. The targeted employees may attempt
to show members of the mob that they do not feel superior to
them or want them to experience any distress, which only
reassures zero-empathy leaders that their destructive plan is
working.
Employees who are targeted experience anxiety and dis-
tress because of their elevated blood levels of cortisol, the
fight or flight hormone, and may interpret this response as a
sign of personal weakness. Holding themselves to high stan-
dards of performance, they experience a lowered self-confi-
dence, because their reaction seems to be excessive.
Interpreting anxiety as personal weakness can lead them to
assume responsibility for their loss of friends and lowered
social status. When efforts to appease attackers fail, they
withdraw from as many forms of contact as are possible in a
work situation.
We know that targets of abuse may suffer long-term
impairments with regard to their occupational careers, their
mental well-being, self-esteem, and physical health. Some
individuals require various forms of therapy to reenter the
job market (Namie & Lutgen-Sandvik, 2010). Asking for
more involvement by the psychiatric community, Kemp
(2014) also notes that targets often need psychiatric treat-
ment and that these attacks can have a lifelong impact. He
also observes that supervisory personnel generally have dif-
ficulty identifying workplace abuse.
There are reports that sustained exposure to these work-
place attacks leads to high blood pressure and increased risk
of coronary heart disease. With continued exposure to this
kind of treatment, increased levels of cortisol may cause
panic attacks. In the extreme, attacked employees experience
end-state anxiety, which is emotional paralysis; the person is
disabled and cannot perform the most basic of tasks (Namie
& Namie, 2009). As the level of stress for the targeted
employee increases, thinking and memory are also impaired.
Stress may cause a shift in memory from more flexible cog-
nitive thinking to the more rigid habitual memory (Sabrina,
Marcel, & Wolf, 2005). This suggests that targeted employ-
ees engaged in creative activities may become weaker
Popp 5
problem-solvers than before, though this change may not be
observable.
At the first signs of emotional discomfort, an abused
employee should take some defensive action (Temin, 2010).
Continued bullying by abusers over weeks and months can-
not be endured without significant emotional damage. An
abused employee should avoid thoughts of reactive aggres-
sion, which is a common response from individuals who feel
they have low social status (Henry, 2007). These responses
will provide new content for the whisper campaign, and
those who observe these actions will be drawn to agree with
the abusers' comments about the targeted employee's stabil-
ity. The empathic capacity that makes the abused employee a
valuable employee is also the characteristic that makes the
employee more vulnerable to the efforts of his or her attack-
ers, and gives the attacker a greater sense of personal power.
By design, many colleagues will not recognize the abuse
taking place, with respect to desirable employees (Babiak
& Hare, 2006), but they will recognize their abilities and
competence. When they falsely learn, by means of the
whisper campaign, that the targeted employee believes he
or she is better, more important, or more valuable than
everyone else, the noninvolved employees may believe the
gossip and develop some disdain for the targeted person.
Some may be relieved to know that the individual is not so
perfect after all.
At a critical point, the targeted employee's levels of corti-
sol may increase to the point where there is an impairment of
judgment and behavior. This, in turn, provides credibility for
the zero-empathy employee's constant negative comments.
Original doubters may begin to think the criticism is legiti-
mate. Once again, the disbelief that an employee in their
midst could intentionally visit this kind of evil on a colleague
protects the zero-empathy employee and renders more effec-
tive the abuse of a good employee. When these highly
empathic and productive targeted employees are rejected and
defamed by those who obviously have no commitment to the
organization, the situation becomes unbearable for them.
Worse still is the discovery that the employee's former
friends are part of the abusive mob. Zero-empathy mob lead-
ers know that a former friend who has become an abuser is
especially devastating to a targeted employee.
Note that overt, hostile, and heated bullying will call
attention to itself as behavior that is markedly deviant from
normal employee-to-employee interaction. But the subtle
day-by-day distancing of former friends from a targeted
employee is much more devastating than being addressed in
a hostile manner by angry colleagues. Although bullying is a
device frequently used, the sole focus on this behavior misses
the numerous subtle aspects of abuse. Moreover, employees
may fear that if they report abuse, they will be seen as over-
reacting. They may also be aware of the resentment toward
them by other employees, who regard their popularity as the
result of some sort of manipulation. Having low social intel-
ligence, these employees cannot comprehend what it is about
the abused employee that is so valued by others, and may not
be unhappy to see the targeted employee in distress.
More productive and desirable employees will be the first
to leave, because they have more employment options than
their peers and will more quickly and directly grasp the
intentions of the zero-empathy employees and the mob mem-
bers with whom they work. Their departure is seen by those
who remain as a clear demonstration of the power of the
abusers. Employees who cannot leave, for whatever reason,
provide the greatest pleasure for the zero-empathy leaders,
because this allows them the social status of master of the
workplace.
Members of the mob may, in private, explain to targeted
employees that if they would act differently, they would be
better accepted. This is intended, of course, to make the tar-
gets feel that it is their fault that they are being rejected--an
abusive technique sometimes referred to as gaslighting.
Undermining self-confidence is an effective device for
increasing anxiety. If other employees see the target as emo-
tionally broken down, but without knowledge of the mob-
bing going on, the target will experience an even greater
distancing from peers, which of course escalates anxiety
levels.
The most troubling aspect of these attacks is not the joy
some find in hurting others; some people are wired for creat-
ing distress in those with whom they interact. When it
becomes clear to targeted employees that they are under an
attack in which their former friends are actively and enthusi-
astically participating, they believe either that the insecurity
of employees with whom they work and who participate in
the mobbing must be greater than they thought, or that the
supposed friendships were forced and inauthentic all along.
There is one additional torment visited upon the targeted
employees. Neuroscientists report that there exists what they
refer to as the default network. When we are unoccupied for
even a few seconds with a task or problem, the default net-
work takes our minds to other people (Lieberman, 2013).
Neuroscientists think that this network makes us more social,
in that we learn about other people in small episodes during
the day. For a targeted employee, the default network adds to
the distress of being mobbed, because their thoughts are of
their tormentors, former friends, and associates. When peo-
ple are experiencing abuse by their associates, it is these indi-
viduals to which the default network turns, and serves to
cycle thinking over and over on the instances of bullying.
Eventually, they may experience panic attacks, which at
times will be detected by others. If they abruptly leave a
meeting, this is observed with glee by the zero-empathy
employee. When someone under attack cannot leave a posi-
tion or if there is no other source of relief, depression's end
state is realized. In this state of emotional paralysis, employ-
ees find it difficult to function in the workplace or anywhere
else. Physical illness may follow, and whatever the conse-
quences of the abuse on targeted employees, their families
will also experience collateral damage.
6 SAGE Open
Davia Temin (2010), a workplace consultant, urges those
caught in these workplace situations to trust their instincts, if
they suspect that a sociopath has infiltrated the company. She
encourages affected persons to keep records, including taped
conversations, if allowed in their states, and to keep all
emails that may pertain to abuse of any kind. Temin also
counsels targets to defend themselves with the truth, and not
to let a lie go unchallenged. Sooner, rather than later, she sug-
gests that affected persons leave the company, as it often
takes justice in these situations a long time to win out. It is
better to leave with one's physical and mental abilities intact
than to wait too long. Finally, Temin urges employees to sup-
port each other in the workplace, to the extent this is possi-
ble. Good people rarely recognize evil, as this kind of
behavior is incomprehensible to them. Under these circum-
stances, the friendship of those who stay rational in these
situations is vital.
Help for affected individuals is available on a number of
websites, including the Workplace Bullying Institute (2017),
which offers self-help advice and personal coaching for indi-
viduals targeted for workplace abuse. They also collect and
coordinate research associated with workplace bullying
worldwide, and promote legislative advocacy on behalf of a
safe and positive work environment.
Further Research
Moving forward in the attempt to mitigate the destructiveness
of sociopaths in the workplace will require studies that
develop more highly sophisticated and accurate screening
tools for use in the hiring practice. Surveys that identify effec-
tive methods of approaching HR for help in situations that
suggest sociopathic activity and those that document legal
arguments successful in prosecuting those who have been so
identified would also be valuable. Similar surveys could help-
fully identify and share ways that workplace colleagues and
unions provide support for victims of sociopathic assault.
Summary
This article proposes the study of workplace abuse by means
of a theoretical model drawn from recent research in neuro-
science, and from the psychological literature concerned
with individuals who intentionally harm those with whom
they associate. The proposed explanation of this abuse iden-
tifies the employees targeted for abuse as competent and
respected individuals in the workplace. These persons are
selected by one or more zero-empathy individuals who inten-
tionally cause distress and anxiety in their targeted associ-
ates. Lacking a conscience, they enjoy inflicting pain on
better qualified employees and gain satisfaction from the
power they are able to demonstrate in bringing down a well-
regarded colleague. Leaders of these attacks select other
weaker employees to assist in the bullying of the targeted
employee. They, in turn, join in on the abuse, either out of
fear or because they have something to gain in being associ-
ated with a power source that will protect them, in return for
their loyalty. Members of the whisper campaign are low-
empathy employees who enjoy discussing the pain and mis-
fortunes of their fellow employees. Those targeted are urged
to recognize when this kind of abuse is occurring, to resist
self-blame, and to leave the situation, if at all possible.
