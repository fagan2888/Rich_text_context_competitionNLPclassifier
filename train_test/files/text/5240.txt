Abstract: This study tested whether life history strategy (LHS) and its intergenerational
transmission could explain young adult use of common psychoactive substances. We tested
a sequential structural equation model using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth. During young adulthood, fast LHS explained 61% of the variance in overall liability
for substance use. Faster parent LHS predicted poorer health and lesser alcohol use, greater
neuroticism and cigarette smoking, but did not predict fast LHS or overall liability for
substance use among young adults. Young adult neuroticism was independent of substance
use controlling for fast LHS. The surprising finding of independence between parent and
child LHS casts some uncertainty upon the identity of the parent and child LHS variables.
Fast LHS may be the primary driver of young adult use of common psychoactive
substances. However, it is possible that the young adult fast LHS variable is better defined
as young adult mating competition. We discuss our findings in depth, chart out some
intriguing new directions for life history research that may clarify the dimensionality of
LHS and its mediation of the intergenerational transmission of substance use, and discuss
implications for substance abuse prevention and treatment.

Introduction
Substance use disorders (SUDs) are among the most frequently experienced
psychiatric disorders in the United States. In 2011, an estimated 20.6 million persons aged
12 or older (i.e., 8% of the population) met the criteria for substance abuse or dependence
during the past year (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
[SAMHSA], 2012). Substance abuse bears a large economic footprint in addition to its
impact on the lives of individuals. The National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse
(CASA) estimated that the total governmental expenditure on substance abuse at all three
levels of government (i.e., federal, state, and local) totaled 467.7 billion dollars, or more
than 10% of the entire governmental budget (CASA, 2005).
Young adults are of special interest in efforts to reduce the societal burden imposed
by substance abuse. In 2011, 60.8% of full-time college students were current drinkers,
while 39.1% were binge drinkers and 13.6% were heavy drinkers. For young adults who
were not enrolled full time in college, these figures were observed at 52.0, 35.4, and 10.5%,
respectively (SAMHSA, 2012). An estimated 39.5% of young adults currently use tobacco
products (SAMHSA, 2012). Young adults also abuse illicit substances, of which marijuana
use is most prevalent by a wide margin. About 21% of young adults were current users of
illicit substances, with 19.0% reporting that they were marijuana users (SAMHSA, 2012).
Young adult substance abuse has been linked to many adverse outcomes such as
increased delinquency (Nation and Heflinger, 2006), impaired cognitive functioning
(Jacobus, Bava, Cohen-Zion, Mahmood, and Tapert, 2009), emotional distress (Goldstein,
2011), respiratory problems and lung cancer (CDC, 1994), and accidents or other behaviors
that lead to serious medical injury and death (Miller, Naimi, Brewer, and Jones, 2007;
Pompili et al., 2012). This study brings life history theory to bear on substance use during
young adulthood. If life history variables can explain substantial variation in substance use
during this period, there may be impetus for leveraging the literature on human life
histories to improve substance abuse prevention and treatment.
Life history theory
Evolutionary psychology attempts to discover how the brain changes the
environment to facilitate the reproduction of the organism (Hagen, 2005). To transform the
environment in a manner conducive to reproduction, brains must drive humans to find food
and mates, best competitors, avoid predators and pathogens, and help kin (Buss, 2009;
Hagen, 2005). To accomplish these tasks, humans convert bio-energetic resources into
survival and reproductive strategies (Chisholm, 1993; Del Giudice, 2009; Figueredo et al.,
2006).
Life history theory (LHT) is a mid-level evolutionary theory that provides an
account of what survival and reproductive strategies humans invest in given their genes and
the environments they inhabit (Chisholm, 1993; Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, and Schlomer,
2009; Figueredo et al., 2006; Rushton, 1985). In particular, LHT suggests that humans fall
along a spectrum from early reproduction and allocation of resources toward mating effort,
to later reproduction and devotion of resources toward somatic and parental effort
(Chisholm, 1993; Ellis et al., 2009; Figueredo et al., 2006; Rushton, 1985). This continuum
of reproductive strategy has recently been referred to as the fast­to­slow life history
continuum in the human behavior and evolution literature (e.g., Figueredo et al., 2006).
Life history and substance abuse

Behaviors and traits such as risk-taking, short-term thinking, anti-sociality, earlier sexual
debut, and acquisition of greater numbers of sexual partners have been observed to reflect a
faster life history strategy (LHS). Behaviors and traits such as careful consideration of
risks, long-term thinking, cooperation, greater sexual restrictedness, and better mental and
physical health have been observed to reflect a slower LHS (for reviews, see Ellis et al.,
2009; Figueredo et al., 2006). Fast LHS appears to be a facultative response to harsh and
unpredictable environments, whereas slow LHS seems to stem from safety and
predictability (Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis, 2009; Ellis et al., 2009).
Life history strategy and substance use
Several scholars have brought LHT to bear on substance use theoretically and
empirically (Hill and Chow, 2002; Jones and Figueredo, 2007; Richardson and Hardesty,
2012). They have argued that LHT provides a powerful explanatory tool that can provide
new insights into the etiology of substance abuse and also help identify novel targets for
prevention and treatment interventions (e.g., Richardson and Hardesty, 2012). Research has
indicated that the brain experiences substances as biologically valuable via their
modulation of basic motivational systems (i.e., via their effects on dopamine transmission
and incentive salience; Goldman, Darkes, Reich, and Brandon, 2006; Nesse, 1994, 2002;
Volkow, Fowler, Wang, Swanson, and Telang, 2007). As mentioned, research also suggests
that human behaviors coordinate within overall life history strategies that function to
translate biologically valuable resources (e.g., food) into mating effort or somatic and
parental effort (Chisholm, 1993; Del Giudice, 2009; Figueredo et al., 2006). In a recent
theoretical synthesis of LHT and dual process models of cognition, Richardson and
Hardesty (2012) used cognitive science to integrate these findings and suggested that once
we know where individuals fall along the life history spectrum, we also have information
about their liability for substances use. The authors predicted that liability for substance use
reflects a fast LHS because reliance on implicit or automatic cognitive processing (adapted
to harsh and unpredictable environments) underpins fast LHS and also renders humans
vulnerable to the signals of biological value that psychoactive substances provide. From
this perspective, substance use is generally seen as a byproduct of a psychological
adaptation to harsh and unpredictable social conditions.
Consistent with the above, research has suggested that particular types of substance
use coordinate with fast life history traits. For example, studies have linked college student
mating effort to smoking (Jones and Figueredo, 2007) and also indicated that alcohol use
coordinated with fast life history traits (Hill and Chow, 2002). Research has also linked fast
LHS to lower levels of executive functioning (Figueredo, Gladden, and Beck, 2011). This
suggests that fast life history strategists may rely on implicit processing, which operates at
the expense of the prefrontal explicit or deliberative processes (Lieberman, 2007; van Honk
and Schutter, 2007) that underpin executive functions such as attention shifting and
inhibition (Friedman et al., 2006). Taken together, this research provides some initial
support for the notion that specific types of substance use coordinate with life history traits
and that implicit processing may drive fast LHS (for further discussion, see Richardson and
Hardesty, 2012).
Despite emerging research on how substance use coordinates with life history traits,
it is not clear to what extent specific types of substance use coordinate with the overall life
history dimension that has subsumed these traits in prior research. It is also not clear how
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -935-
overall liability for substance use (i.e., the tendency to use a variety of substances)
coordinates with life history traits or latent LHS. In this study, we fill these gaps in the
literature by examining the extent to which liability for substance use reflects young adult
LHS.
LHS and the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse
Researchers have observed the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse
and identified explanatory mechanisms such as genetic transmission, history of shared
environments, and a number of family variables including dysfunctional family systems,
poor parenting, and direct modeling (for a review, see Thornberry, Krohn, and Freeman-
Gallant, 2006). Interestingly, many of the same mechanisms that transmit high levels of
substance use from parents to children have been implicated in the intergenerational
transmission of LHS. For example, although the adoption of faster or slower LHS is
developmentally contingent on environmental cues, studies have illuminated a genetic basis
for LHS and indicated that humans inherit a degree of their propensity toward a faster or
slower strategy. In one study, Figueredo, Vasquez, Brumbach, and Schneider (2004)
estimated the heritability of LHS at .65. In addition, Figueredo et al. (2006) implicated
many of the brain regions responsible for substance abuse (i.e., the frontal cortex,
amygdala, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and dopaminergic pathways; Goldstein and
Volkow, 2002; Margaron, 2004; Volkow, Fowler, and Wang, 2004; Volkow et al., 2007;
Yucel, Lubman, Solowij, and Brewer, 2007) in the development and maintenance of LHS,
suggesting that perhaps substance abuse and LHS share common genetic and
neuropsychological bases.
Intergenerational transmission via shared environment is grounded in the
assumption that many youths grow up in the same type of environments as their parents.
For instance, the literature shows strong support for the intergenerational transmission of
socioeconomic status (SES; Carvalho, 2012), which implies that environmental cues for
faster or slower life history strategies are often persistent across two generations. In the
United States, for example, greater loss of health and fertility among lower SES women
compared with those of higher SES can cue the adoption of faster life history strategies
among both parents and children (Geronimus 1987, 1992). Consistent with these notions,
pregnancy and high-risk sexual activity among teens have been linked to welfare
dependence, low SES, and the intergenerational transmission of poverty (for a review, see
Figueredo et al., 2006). There are likely reciprocal relationships between parental behavior
and the dimensions of the environments shared by parents and children (e.g., safety and
predictability). In part, parents may be the passive recipients of the environments they
inhabit, while some active environmental selection and maintenance likely occurs as well.
Finally, family variables such as dysfunctional family systems and poor parenting
have been identified as manifestations of faster LHS (for a review, see Figueredo et al.,
2006). As Hill and Kaplan (1999) pointed out, there are two sets of decisions that parents
have to make-- one regarding individual fitness, and the other, offspring fitness. Parental
investment decisions often reflect environmental risk and also provide signals that children
can use in the facultative development of their own life history strategies (e.g., early
attachment; Belsky, 1997; Chisholm, 1993; Del Giudice, 2009; Quinlan, 2012). In terms of
genetic fitness, parents who invest in children in an environmentally contingent manner
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -936-
will reap benefits, as will children who can respond to parental behavior with the most
adaptive reproductive strategy available.
Parent LHS may predict LHS in their children because (1) parents and children
share genes, (2) parents inhabit and maintain environments that influence LHS
development in children, and (3) parents provide behavioral cues that bear on children's
LHS development. In this study, we examine the possibility that liability for young adult
substance use can be explained by the intergenerational transmission of LHS.
The Current Study
This study brings LHT to bear on substance use by testing whether LHS and its
intergenerational transmission can explain substance use among young adults. The
questions driving this research are: (1) Among young adults, to what extent can liability for
substance use be understood as a manifestation of LHS? And, (2) does the intergenerational
transmission of LHS from parent to child explain young adult substance use?
Methods
We used National Longitudinal Survey data to test the extent to which LHS
subsumed young adult substance use and also whether parent LHS could predict child
substance use during young adulthood through young adult children's LHS. We addressed
our research questions by testing a structural equation model (SEM) using the one step and
single or few best indicator(s) approach advocated by Leslie Hayduk and colleagues (see
Hayduk, Cummings, Boadu, Pazderka-Robinson, and Boulianne, 2007; Hayduk and
Glaser, 2000; Hayduk and Litvay, 2012). Hayduk's method emphasizes theoretical
precision over the use of scales that include many observed variables, and adheres more
closely to path modeling tradition than to the factor analytic convention of using many
indicators and multiple steps of testing (see Hayduk and Glaser, 2000; Mulaik and Millsap,
2000).
Hayduk and Litvay (2012) suggested that researchers use theory to locate the
correct latent variables (i.e., construct centroids; see Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade,
1999) and then model the single or few best indicator(s) of these variables. This approach
allows for the specification of more complex latent structures due to decreased complexity
at the measurement level. This is often a necessary trade-off because of sample size
limitations, but also because of the increasing likelihood that structural models will fit
poorly as the number of measurement portions increases. Large models with many multi-
item scales will often fail due to redundancy in item wording, greater likelihood that item
content will overlap the meaning of other latent variables and their reflective indicators
(e.g., because scales have deficient discriminant validity; see McGrath, 2005), and greater
likelihood that the latent portions of models will be misspecified (e.g., due to omission of
latent variables; see Hayduk and Litvay, 2012).
LHT provides mid-level rather than proximate explanations for coordination among
a variety of human psychological and behavioral domains. From a causal modeling
perspective, mid-level explanations describe the behavior of variables that impact their
observed indicators indirectly (e.g., LHS impacts responses to items measuring neuroticism
indirectly through latent neuroticism). If a variable directly impacts its indicators, it is their
proximate cause, providing proximate explanation of item scores. By traditional factor
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -937-
analytic standards, studies of mid-level latent variables like LHS will require measurement
of many domains to ensure that the latent variables of interest are located. This implies that
many scales, each including many items, are needed. This requirement can place a burden
on life history researchers in terms of survey length and sample size, and would seem to
imply that they could not capitalize on nationally representative sets that may include
scales that measure some life history domains but only one or two indicators of others.
Fortunately, simulation research has indicated that many items and higher levels of
internal consistency, or large factor loadings, are not required to locate construct centroids
and recover unbiased parameter estimates when a broad selection of indicators are available
and when confirmatory latent variable modeling is used (Little, Lindenberger, and
Nesselroade, 1999). In other words, a broad selection of indicators can provide valid
measurement even when indicators are only moderately related to their constructs or reflect
them indirectly. This is good news for life history researchers because it suggests that
shorter surveys and smaller samples can be sufficient when strong theory is available to
provide precision in indicator selection and model specification (as described in Hayduk
and Litvay, 2012). This also suggests that nationally representative longitudinal sets such as
NLSY97, which were not designed to test life history evolution and do not provide full
scales that measure LHS, can still be quite valuable to life history researchers because they
provide indicators of a broad selection of life history domains and their large sample sizes
facilitate the testing of models with complex latent portions.
Sample
This study examined data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997
(U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2013). The NLSY97 data document the school-to-
work or adolescence-to-adulthood transition and are comprised of two samples: a cross-
sectional sample representing the U.S. population born in the years 1980 through 1984, and
oversamples of the black and Hispanic population born in those years. Participants were
drawn from 75,291 households in 147 primary sampling units that did not overlap; 8,984
individuals were interviewed in round 1 and data for more than 84% of the initial sample
were available in round 13. Table 1 presents demographics for the full NLSY97 sample.

The NLSY97 contains extensive information on respondent labor market behavior
and educational experiences, along with family and community background. These data
can help researchers examine the longitudinal influence of schooling, environmental, and
Life history and substance abuse

other factors on a variety of outcomes. For a full description of the NLS97 data and the
procedures by which they were collected, see the NLS97 website
(http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy97.htm).
We used life history theory to select 18 indicators of life history traits from the
variables available in the national survey. The 18 items were selected as indicators of
parent LHS in 1997, child LHS in 2009, and child liability for substance use in 2009 (see
Table 2). In 2009, participants were aged 22 to 26. Because attrition is often a concern with
longitudinal data, we conducted a missing data analysis. In this study, we used a custom set
of survey weights in our analyses that adjusted for the survey design and also for use of
1997 and 2009 data. We constructed these weights using the web app provided on the NLS
website (http://www.nlsinfo.org/weights/nlsy97).

Missing data
In this study, we conducted a missing data analysis because our data were
longitudinal and attrition was a concern. Across 18 variables, 8,984 cases were initially
available for analysis. We examined the variables carefully and found that 16.1% of the
data was missing on average, with a range from 8.0% missing for mother's age at first
childbirth (1997) to 16.6% for number of days young adults drank alcohol (2009). We
investigated the missing information for our 18 variables further and found substantial
mean differences for collected information on whether or not missing data were present.
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -939-
For example, we observed that cases missing parent income data in 1997 averaged more
smoking in 2009 than non-missing cases. These observed mean differences suggested that
the missing completely at random assumption (MCAR) for listwise deletion was
inappropriate. Therefore, we found it necessary to make the relaxed assumption of missing
at random (MAR; Little and Rubin, 2002). We used multiple imputation to handle the
missing data and used 12 auxiliary variables to help satisfy the ignorable missingness
assumption (Little and Rubin, 2002). These included self-reported data for some of our 18
variables that were gathered at other time points and also data for several personality traits.
We generated five imputed datasets using the NORM 2.03 package for Windows (Schafer,
1997).
Our study contained several skewed variables that violated the normality
assumption of our imputation model. While this isn't ideal in theory, the methods literature
indicates that in the context of ordinal variables and skew, multiple imputation under a
normal model preserves important characteristics of the data set as a whole (e.g., variances)
and makes use of all possible information (Enders, 2010; von Hippel, 2013). The idea is
that although the imputed values do not look like the observed values, the imputed variable
behaves like the observed variable in the analysis. One strategy that has been recommended
for satisfying the normality assumption of imputation models is the transformation of
skewed variables prior to imputation. However, research suggests this actually hurts the
imputation of variables that are linearly related because it introduces non-linearity and
residual non-normality (von Hippel, 2013). Although transformations help match variables'
marginal distributions to the imputation model's assumptions, they create problems with
the effects between variables and can skew residuals, which together lead to imputed values
that bias estimates in the analysis phase. In this study, we chose multiple imputation under
a normal model and imputed skewed variables as they were, given that this method is
robust to departures from normality assumptions and produces reasonably unbiased
parameter estimates that reflect the uncertainty associated with estimating missing data
(Enders, 2010; Little and Rubin, 2002; von Hippel, 2013).
Instruments
We selected indicators of parent and child LHS that have been observed to reflect a
broad set of domain-specific LHS components in prior research (for a review, see
Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figueredo, 2014). Following Little, Lindenberger, and
Nesselroade (1999), we expected that this broad selection would enable us to locate the
correct latent LHS variable. We observed the standardized coefficients between latent
variables and their reflective indicators for information regarding reliability and construct
validity (Bollen, 1989; Kline, 2010). Because of our focus on theoretically driven latent
variables and use of few indicators instead of scales, and because the assumptions of
coefficient alpha (see Cronbach, 1951) are unlikely to hold in practice (Bentler, 2009;
Green and Yang, 2009; Sijtsma, 2009), we did not report alpha in the discussions of most
of our instruments, with one exception: We used a scale to measure neuroticism because
we theorized that this construct was somewhat ambiguous to participants, and we used
coefficient alpha to tentatively assess its reliability.
Parent LHS (1997). In this study, we planned to specify a latent variable
representing respondent parent's LHS, which manifested as household income, parental
health, mother's age at first childbirth, and quality of the home environment maintained by
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -940-
parents. We chose income as an indicator of LHS because although research suggests that
diverging life history strategies may develop as a function of childhood SES, rather than
adult SES, higher income during adulthood can be conceptualized as investment in safe but
low-yield decisions (e.g., investment in education or other forms of embodied capital),
which are characteristic of slower LHS (Griskevicius, Tybur, Delton, and Robertson,
2011). This is consistent with the observation that for roughly 99% of the U.S. population,
income is occupation-generated (Beeghley, 2004). In addition, the correlation between
childhood and adult SES has been observed at r = .41 (Griskevicius et al., 2011). Thus,
greater childhood SES may impact the development of slower LHS and the tendency to
engage in low-yield and safe investing, which in turn manifests as greater education and
income during adulthood. In this study, income was measured as household gross income
reported by parental respondents. We divided income by 10,000 to achieve item variance
ratios that would ensure model convergence.
We chose parental health as an indicator of LHS because it reflects somatic effort,
and prior research has shown that health reflects LHS indirectly through covitality
(Olderbak et al., 2014). Parental health was measured by self-report and rated on a five-
point Likert scale from "excellent" to "poor." We reverse coded this variable for conceptual
clarity. As suggested by Olderbak et al. (2014), we used biological mother's self-reported
age at first childbirth (i.e., the timing or delay of reproduction) as a life history parameter.
To measure the overall quality of the home environment maintained by parents, we used
the riskiness of the family home environment index created by the developers of the
national survey. The index is based on Caldwell and Bradley's Home Observation for
Measurement of the Environment (HOME; Caldwell and Bradley, 1984; Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2013) and combined responses to items that measured domains such as the
quality of the youth's physical home environment, family routines in an average week, the
extent of parental monitoring, and the quality of youth-parent relationships. These items
measured domains that reflected parental investment. Scores ranged from 0 to 21, with
higher scores indicating greater risk. We divided riskiness of the home environment by 100
to ensure model convergence.
Child LHS during young adulthood (2009). This study examined manifestations of
young adult LHS including neuroticism, delinquency, health, and mating effort. We chose
to include neuroticism because prior research showed that it reflected LHS indirectly
through the general factor of personality (Olderbak et al., 2014). We measured adolescent
neuroticism using five self-report items that assessed anxiety and depression (i.e., nervous,
calm, down, happy, and depression). An example of item wording is, "How much of the
time during the last month have you been a very nervous person?" During young
adulthood, the neuroticism scale had a mean of 11.55, a standard deviation of 2.42, and
Cronbach's  was observed at .79. The latter suggested that this scale's items were
internally consistent during young adulthood and might reflect a single dimension. We
measured adolescent health as self-reported general health rated on a five-point scale from
"excellent" to "poor." Item wording was, "How is your general health?" We reverse coded
this item for conceptual clarity.
As suggested by Olderbak et al. (2014), we used respondent children's reported
number of sexual partners during the past 12 months as a life history parameter. We
specified this variable and also respondent's reported number of persons dated in the past
12 months as reflecting young adult mating effort. For number of sexual partners, we
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -941-
needed to use a distribution that could handle counts (e.g., negative-binomial or Poisson).
Unfortunately, number of sexual partners exceeded the max number for counts and
categorical variables in MPlus 6.11 and also contained imputed values below zero. We
considered transforming this variable after imputation. However, transformations appear to
perform poorly in the context of count data, especially when dispersion is large (O'Hara
and Kotze, 2010). We also theorized that this variable's reliability decreased as counts
became more extreme and the difference between one and two sexual partners was not
equal in meaning to the difference between, say, 15 and 16 partners. Thus, we planned to
treat number of sexual partners as ordinal and bucketed participants into four categories of
mating effort, ranging from fewest to most partners, on the basis of substantive rationale
and item distribution. The categories were as follows: none or a single partner, two
partners, three to six partners, and more than six partners. As a result of multiple
imputation, the number of people dated item contained some out-of-range values that fell
below zero. We recoded values less than -5 into -2, values between -4 and -1 into -1, and
then analyzed the -1s and -2s as they were. According to Enders (2010, p. 265), this is good
practice when the prevalence of out-of-range values is low. In this study, only 7.1% of the
values were negative for the number of persons dated item. There were five categories of
this variable ranging from fewest to most persons dated. The categories were as follows:
less than or equal to -5; -4 to -1; 0; 1 to 4; and 5 or more.
We used young adult delinquency as an indicator of the antagonistic social
strategies and investment in risky but potentially high yield decisions that reflect fast LHS
(Figueredo et al., 2006; Griskevicius et al., 2011). We measured young adult delinquency
using self-reported number of times participants had attacked someone, stolen items worth
more than 50 dollars, and committed other crimes in the last 12 months. We planned to
specify these items as reflecting latent delinquency and treat them as ordinal for the same
reasons as number of sexual partners. Similar to the number of persons dated item, the
delinquency items contained some out-of-range values that fell below zero. Almost all of
these values were -2s or -1s. We recoded values less than -2 into -2 and analyzed the -1s
and -2s as they were. No more than 7% of the values were negative across the delinquency
variables. There were five delinquency categories ranging from fewest to most incidences
and they were invariant across the items. The categories were as follows: less than or equal
to -2; -1; 0; 1; and 2 or more.
Liability for young adult substance use (2009). In this study, liability for substance
use during young adulthood was measured with items that assessed how often the
participant reported using tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana in the last 30 days. An example
of item wording is "How many days have you used marijuana in the last 30 days?" We
planned to specify these three items as reflecting latent liability for substance use. To
ensure model convergence, we divided the substance use items by 30. Unfortunately, the
NLSY97 does not contain detailed information on a variety of "harder" or uncommonly
used illicit substances. Some items in the survey assessed use of any drugs like "cocaine or
crack or heroine," but information about the use of each substance was not available.
Further, in 2009 only 3% of participants had ever used any of these hard substances, and far
fewer participants had used these substances in the last 30 days. Due to the conflation of
the use of various hard substances, and because prevalence of use was so low, we did not
examine items regarding hard substances.

Analyses
This study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to simultaneously test the
extent to which young adult substance use reflected latent young adult LHS and also
whether parent LHS predicted substance use among young adult children indirectly through
young adult LHS. We used the MPlus 6.11 software package to test our models, used raw
data as input, and used Robust Weighted Least Squares (WLSMV) as the estimator. We
used WLSMV because we needed to treat the number of sexual partners and the
delinquency variables as ordinal. In addition, we used WLSMV because there was
substantial skew among the young adult substance use items (i.e., skew statistics slightly
larger than 2). Research on the Robust Weighted Least Squared estimator has indicated that
it yields unbiased estimates when SEM is used in the context of moderate skew (Muthén,
du Toit, and Spisic, 1997). We observed that the ratio of cases to freely estimated
parameters exceeded 100 to 1 for all hypothesized models, easily satisfying the minimum
ratio often indicated for SEM studies (Bentler and Chou, 1987). Because we analyzed very
large samples that provided a great deal of statistical power, all significance tests were
conducted at the p < .001 level. Finally, we used the split-half method to minimize Type I
error (i.e., pure sampling error; Pohlmann, 2004) by randomly splitting our data, testing and
modifying models using one half, and validating models using the other half.
Sensitivity analyses. We planned a sensitivity analysis because the NLS97 sampled
3,855 siblings and this introduced some dependence among the data for respondent
children and also the parents of multiple respondent youth. To test whether this dependence
influenced our estimates, we planned to test our models using samples that included all
respondents with no NLS97 siblings, plus a random selection of one sibling from each
household with multiple respondent youths. If we found substantial differences between the
results for the full sample and this no-siblings sample, we would report on the latter.
Hypothesized model
Our hypothesized model (see Figure 1) tested whether young adult LHS subsumed
liability for young adult substance use. In addition, this model tested whether young adult
LHS translated parent LHS into liability for young adult substance use. We also tested our
hypothesized model across the sexes because prior research has documented sex
differences in reproductive strategy (e.g., Mealey, 2000). For conceptual clarity, we
changed the valence of parent LHS so that higher scores corresponded to faster LHS and
lower parent income, poorer parent health, earlier age at first childbirth, and greater home
risk. Thus, higher scores on parent and also young adult LHS implied faster LHS.
Goodness of fit criteria
This study used a variety of fit indices because they provide different information
about model fit. We considered the substantive meaningfulness of the model, Tucker-Lewis
(TLI) and comparative fit (CFI) indices greater than .95 (Byrne, 2001; Hu and Bentler,
1999), and root mean square error of approximation values of less than .05 (RMSEA;
Browne and Cudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the data. MPlus 6.11 provides
average fit indices and an average 2 likelihood ratio statistic (Byrne, 2001; Kline, 2010)
when multiple imputed sets are analyzed using WLSMV. In this context, the package does
not report a pooled likelihood ratio test.

Results
Structural equation modeling
We tested our hypothesized structural model and it appeared to be severely miss-
specified, observed as a non-positive definite matrix with standardized effects of latent
variables on reflective indicators that were greater than 1, very small effects of young adult
fast LHS on health and neuroticism, and evidence of poor fit to the data (see Table 3).

Note. Model 3 = Model 2 + Alcohol use, smoking, and number of persons dated regressed onto parent fast

Given the findings related to health and neuroticism, we specified a model that
included these variables as correlates of young adult fast LHS instead of its indicators. We
tested this model and it was over-identified with 126 degrees of freedom and characterized
by a RMSEA value below .05, along with CFI and TLI values that fell well below their .95
cutoffs. Most indices suggested this model provided inadequate fit to the data and should
have been rejected (see Table 3). We considered modification indices greater than 100,
standardized residuals greater than 2, and substantive rationale in identifying sources of
misspecification in the model. We modified the model by regressing smoking and alcohol
use on parent fast LHS. These modifications were consistent with prior research that has
linked SES and related variables to use of common substances after controlling for other
latent variables (e.g., Patrick, Wightman, Schoeni, and Shulenberg, 2012; Richardson,
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -944-
2011). We also regressed number of persons dated on parent fast LHS given the possibility
that, in addition to reflecting young adult mating effort, number of dates might reflect
slower LHS parents' encouragement to engage in "official" dating rituals that allow young
adults to size each other up for compatibility and show that they might make good parents
in the future. Consistent with this, research on assortative mating suggests compatibility
and relationship satisfaction are more important in the context of slow LHS (Olderbak and
Figueredo, 2010). Finally, we specified covariances between the calm and happy items
subsumed by neuroticism due to redundant item wordings.
We tested the modified structural model (i.e., Model 3) and it yielded a well-fitting
solution (see Table 3). This model was over-identified with 123 degrees of freedom and
was characterized by a RMSEA value well below .05, and CFI and TLI values above .95.
Consistent with this, we found that no areas of substantial strain remained for the modified
structural model. To minimize Type I error, we cross-validated Model 3 using the other
half of our data and by testing it across males and females. All fit indices suggested that the
model fit the second half of the data, the male data, and the female data very well (see
Table 3). Model 3 sex differences are described below.
In addition to interpreting the model fit indices, we interpreted the substance of the
model's statistically significant parameter estimates (ps < .001; see Figure 2 and Tables 4
and 5). First, we observed the effects of the theorized latent variables on their reflective
indicators. Parent fast LHS had moderate to large effects on its indicators, with s ranging
from .39 to .53 in absolute value. Young adult neuroticism had large effects on its reflective
indicators, with s ranging from .59 to .73 in absolute value. The effects of liability for
young adult substance use on its indicators were moderate to large in size, with s ranging
from .39 to .52. Young adult mating effort had moderate to large effects on its indicators,
which were number of partners dated ( = .36) and number of sexual partners ( = .67).
Young adult delinquency had moderate to large effects on its indicators, with s ranging
from .31 to .42. In Model 3, the first-order latent variables, young adult mating effort,
delinquency, and substance use reflected the second-order latent variable--young adult fast
LHS. Young adult fast LHS had a large positive effect on substance use ( = .78) and
moderate positive effects on mating effort ( = .44) and delinquency ( = .42). The
observed parameters suggested that the reflective indicators provided broad, reasonably
reliable, and valid measurement of their respective constructs.
Next, we observed and interpreted the model's structural regression coefficients.
We found that standardized effects were small in size, with s ranging from .13 to .31 in
absolute value. We found that parent fast LHS had small positive effects on young adult
smoking and neuroticism, small negative effects on number of persons dated and alcohol
use, and a moderate negative effect on health. Parent fast LHS did not have any significant
direct or indirect effects on young adult fast LHS or liability for substance use. A small
positive correlation was observed between young adult fast LHS and neuroticism, while
small negative correlations were observed between fast LHS and adolescent health and
between health and neuroticism. In light of parsimony, the substance of the parameter
estimates, and the observed indices of fit, we accepted Model 3 as the best representation of
the relationships between the variables.

Sex differences. We tested our final model across males and females and the fit to
each group's data was excellent (see Table 3). No effects varied by sex in terms of
statistical significance, and we observed that only one effect of a latent variable on its
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -947-
reflective indicator appeared to vary substantially by sex. The effect of young adult mating
effort on number of sexual partners was observed at  = .75 for males and .59 for females.
We also observed that only one structural regression coefficient appeared to vary across the
sexes. The effect of parent fast LHS on young adult neuroticism was observed at  = .18 for
females and .06 for males. We explore these sex differences further in the discussion.
Sensitivity analyses. We tested Model 3 against our no-siblings sample to assess
whether dependence among the siblings in NLS97 influenced its estimates. Model fit was
very similar between the samples with and without siblings (for the latter, 2 = 381.11; CFI
= .96; TLI = .95; and RMSEA = .03). Only one effect differed in its level of statistical
significance: For the effect of parent fast LHS on young adult neuroticism, p < .001 for the
siblings sample and p = .01 for the no-siblings sample, although its magnitude did not
appear to vary substantially. We tested the model across the male and female samples with
and without siblings and observed no apparent differences. Given the single observed
difference for Model 3, we reported on the full sample.
Discussion
This study tested whether LHS and its intergenerational transmission could explain
substance use among young adults. Before tying our results back to our primary research
questions, we wish to address the finding that not all of our indicators of young adult LHS
reflected a life history dimension. In particular, health and neuroticism did not reflect the
latent fast LHS variable that subsumed mating effort, delinquency, and liability for
substance use. Brumbach et al. (2009) reported similar findings in a study of adolescent and
young adult LHS that also analyzed longitudinal and nationally representative data. During
young adulthood, Brumbach et al. (2009) found that social deviance, which subsumed
delinquency, impulsivity, Machiavellianism, and alcohol use, did not reflect a latent life
history variable that subsumed variables such as health and education. The authors
suggested that perhaps life history traits begin to reflect a single dimension during middle
adulthood. As another possibility, a multi-dimensional structure might subsume life history
traits across the lifespan. This would be consistent with the externalizing and internalizing
dimensions that have emerged from personality traits and behaviors in research on
pathological and normal personality (e.g., Krueger, 2003; Krueger, Markon, Patrick,
Benning, and Kramer, 2007; Krueger, McGue, and Iacono, 2001; Markon, Krueger, and
Watson, 2005). Along this line, it is interesting to note that although low levels on the slow
life history factors (or K-factors) that emerged in prior research may correspond to higher
levels of neuroticism (i.e., anxiety and depression) and lower levels of health, altruism,
conscientiousness, parental investment, and earning potential (Figueredo, Vasquez,
Brumbach, and Sneider, 2007), they do not necessarily imply greater mating effort
(Gladden, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2008; but see Figueredo et al., 2005). For instance,
several studies have reported that slow LHS did not subsume mating effort, which was
instead subsumed by latent variables named psychopathy or psychopathic and aggressive
attitudes (Figueredo, Gladden, and Hohman, 2012; Gladden, Figueredo, and Jacobs, 2008;
Olderbak et al., 2014), a construct that has often reflected an externalizing dimension that is
distinct from the internalizing dimension that subsumes anxiety and depression (e.g.,
Krueger et al., 2007). Taken together, the studies discussed above suggest that mating
effort and its functional correlates (e.g., dominance seeking, aggression, and risk-taking;
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -948-
Trivers, 1971) may vary uniquely from the slow life history dimension that subsumes
timing of reproduction, somatic effort, and parenting effort. In this study, perhaps young
adult fast LHS could be better defined as young adult mating competition.
There are several reasons why mating competition might be independent of slow
LHS in large human (i.e., within species) samples. Van Noordwijk and de Jong (1986)
describe a model in which T (total amount of resources available to an individual) = R
(investment in reproduction) + S (investment in somatic growth or survival). The
implication is that, given lots of within-population variation in T, a positive correlation
between R and S might be observed. In other words, with access to more resources,
organisms have the potential to invest more in mating effort as well as somatic effort. So it
is possible, in principle, that studies of human LHS could be plagued by suppression effects
if they fail to control for resource availability. In our study, we controlled for parental
income, so this seems to be an unlikely problem. However, perhaps parental income is not
a good indicator of resource availability during this period because parents control their
resources and young adult have not yet accumulated significant embodied capital of their
own. However, this would suggest that variation in income may be restricted in range
during this period, which should imply that a suppression effect is more unlikely.
Sibly and Brown (2007) note that variation in metabolic efficiency could have an
effect similar to resource access. We did not have any measure of this parameter, so it is
possible that this omission suppressed the trade-off between mating competition and slow
LHS. That is, this trade-off might manifest among people characterized by the same level
of metabolic efficiency, but not in the U.S. population at large. Perhaps good genes have a
similar effect, with high mate value individuals able to invest more in mating competition
and also slow LHS.
Sibly and Brown (2007, 2009) may have laid the groundwork for an additional
explanation for the independence between mating competition and slow LHS. The authors
demonstrated that holding body size constant, species' locations on the slow-fast life
history continuum were functions of two "lifestyle" components, including diet and
mortality. Greater access to energetic resources corresponded to faster strategies, whereas
decreased mortality corresponded to slower strategies. Extrapolating to within-species
theorizing, it seems possible that independent mating competition and slow LHS systems
could have evolved among humans if mortality and access to resources varied with relative
independence. Complicating this picture for researchers, however, is the fact that modern
humans accumulate extra-somatic wealth that can be invested in warding off death and in
mating competition.
Finally, there are plenty of ways that modern Western societies differ from the
hunter-gatherer ecologies to which humans are generally adapted (Hill and Kaplan, 1999).
Perhaps the significant extra-somatic capital that modern humans accumulate decouples
mating competition from slow LHS. Whatever the case, it is clear that more research is
needed to confirm the dimensionality of young and middle adult life history traits and also
identify how differences between Pleistocene and modern environments bear on human
LHS. Such research is especially salient given a recent critique of psychological measures
of LHS that have stemmed from Differential K theory (see Copping, Campbell, and
Muncer, 2014). The authors suggest that better validation of such measures is needed,
including linkage to life history parameters such as the timing of puberty and reproduction
as well as number of sexual partners.
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -949-
Our results indicated that young adult fast LHS explained 61% of the variance in
young adult liability for substance use (see Table 4). In contrast, health and neuroticism
were minimally and only indirectly related to substance use through young adult fast LHS.
Perhaps poor health and neuroticism don't become important correlates of substance use
until middle adulthood. This would be consistent with substance use typologies such as
Cloninger's categorization of alcoholics into Types 1 (associated with anxiety proneness
and loss of control over alcohol intake after age 25) and 2 (associated with impulsivity and
antisocial behavior before age 25; Cloninger, Sigvardsson, and Bohman, 1996). Our model
suggests that fast LHS is the primary driver of substance use during young adulthood.
However, given our discussion of the dimensionality of life history traits, it might be better
to conclude that mating competition subsumes most of the variance in young adult
substance use. Future research could shed light on this issue by modeling additional
indicators of substance use, mating competition, and also timing of reproduction, somatic
effort, and potential parental effort among young adults.
Parent fast LHS did not predict fast LHS or overall liability for substance use
among young adults. The absence of a direct effect of parent fast LHS on young adult fast
LHS was very surprising. Stemming from our discussion of the dimensionality of life
history traits, one potential explanation for this finding is that LHS is transmitted along two
dimensions--slow LHS (i.e., delayed reproduction coupled with somatic and parental
effort) and mating competition. Perhaps this study, despite our best efforts to use
theoretical precision in indicator selection, located the slow dimension among parents while
locating the mating competition dimension among young adults. Slow LHS among parents
may predict slow traits but not mating competition among children, whereas mating
competition among parents predicts mating competition but not slow life history traits
among children. We had access to good indicators of parent slow LHS, including timing of
reproduction and somatic and parental effort. Perhaps this variable would not also subsume
parent mating competition. More research is needed to address this possibility, and
additional theoretical work is required to determine whether this empirically derived
proposal can be reconciled with life history theory or is biologically plausible.
Two additional potential explanations of the finding discussed above are (1) that the
effect of parent fast LHS on young adult liability for substance use, through young adult
fast LHS, was nil because of the lengthy 12-year lag between the measurement of parent
and child variables, and (2) that unique features of the environments young adults typically
inhabit in Western societies moderated the effect between parent and child LHS. Regarding
(2), perhaps young adult fast LHS is relatively uncoordinated with parent fast LHS because
during this period children often leave their home environments, inhabit novel young adult
dominated ecologies (e.g., college), and are integrating themselves into new social groups.
During young adulthood, reproductive strategies among children may not have canalized
much and may not yet reflect their parents' strategies. As young adults find ecological
niches for themselves and their social statuses and attachments stabilize, perhaps their life
history strategies begin to bear greater resemblance to the strategies maintained by parents.
In other words, the observed independence of parent slow LHS and young adult mating
competition dimensions may be an artifact of modern Western environments. The study of
"emerging adulthood" reflects the many unique features and experiences of this population.
To address these possibilities, future research could test whether adolescent LHS links
parent LHS to young adult substance use.
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -950-
Parent fast LHS did have direct effects on the use of specific substances. In particular,
parent fast LHS had small negative effects on young adult alcohol use and small positive
effects on young adult smoking. These findings are consistent with research indicating that
SES, which includes income, predicts greater alcohol use and lesser tobacco smoking
among young adults in the US (e.g., Patrick et al., 2012). Perhaps LHS explains this
finding. Parent fast LHS also had a significant positive effect on young adult neuroticism
and a moderate negative effect on young adult health. These effects of parent LHS on child
health and neuroticism were persistent across a twelve year lag (i.e., from 1997 to 2009)
and are consistent with findings that slow life history dimensions are heritable and subsume
covitality (i.e., mental and physical health; see Figueredo et al., 2004, 2006). These effects
are also consistent with the literature on family environment and family functioning that we
discussed in LHS and the intergenerational transmission of substance abuse. After
controlling for young adult fast LHS, parent fast LHS predicted fewer persons dated during
young adulthood. As suggested, this may reflect a greater tendency of slower LHS parents
to encourage children to go out on "official" dates where food and recreation are
purchased.
During this study, we observed few sex differences in the structure of life history
traits. However, young adult fast LHS did appear to have a smaller effect on number of sex
partners for females than males. This suggests a very interesting avenue for future research.
Among young adult females, perhaps mating effort is thwarted by childbirths, which
impose less of a burden on males employing a fast LHS. The positive effect between parent
fast LHS and young adult neuroticism was larger for females, suggesting faster parent
strategies may exacerbate anxiety and depression in females to a greater extent than in
males. Further research could examine family structure as a moderator of this effect.
Finally, it is important to note that we have reported on structural sex differences only.
Mean differences on the constructs we studied likely exist as well (for discussion, see
Mealey, 2000), but our primary interest in this study was elucidation of structure.
Richardson and Hardesty (2012) suggested that life history theory (LHT) provides a
powerful explanatory tool that can provide new insights into the etiology of substance
abuse and also help identify novel targets for prevention and treatment interventions.
Indeed, this study indicates that fast LHS or mating competition explained most of the
variance in liability for young adult substance use. Scholars such as Howard Schaffer
(2012) have recently argued that substance abuse is underpinned by an addiction syndrome,
of which heightened substance use is just one manifestation. The current study provides
some support for this view. Additional research that simultaneously estimates the linkages
between substance use and life history indicators is sorely needed. Such work could help to
clarify the relationship between slow LHS and mating competition, along with the extent to
which substance use is a byproduct of these dimensions.
Implications for clinicians and prevention specialists
Mental health model interventions have a long history of targeting parental
structuring of the home environment, parental income, and other parent life history traits in
efforts to improve the mental health and adjustment of children. This study suggests that
such interventions may not have effects on fast LHS (or mating competition) or liability for
substance use that persists into young adulthood. Two exceptions seem to be alcohol use
and smoking behavior. Controlling for young adult fast LHS, parent fast LHS predicted
Life history and substance abuse
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -951-
higher levels of smoking into young adulthood, while predicting lesser alcohol use. Perhaps
future research will bear out the notion that a focus on mating competition dimensions
among parents would be more useful in treatments. If so, this might imply that
interventions could focus on cuing decreases in mating competition and externalizing
behaviors instead of focusing primarily on increasing slow LHS or mental health.
Perhaps the most important practical implication of the current research is that
substance use should be considered in a broader ecological context. For clinicians and
preventionists, adopting an ecological view of substance use will mean attempting to
impact dimensions of LHS to indirectly influence a variety of outcomes such as substance
use. As the mental health professions move toward a greater focus on comorbidity, we
believe LHT can provide a guiding framework for understanding why certain disorders co-
occur. From a life history perspective, many psychiatric disorders may co-occur as
manifestations of reproductive strategies adapted to particular environmental conditions.
Ultimately, evolutionarily informed research and practice may move the field toward a
broader and less pathologizing view of mental disorders.
Limitations
Several limitations complicate our inferences from this study's results. This study is
limited by the use of self-report data. Error can be introduced in the retrieval processes
associated with memory, and self-presentation bias can sometimes influence results. In
spite of their limitations, self-report data are economical and robust enough that their use is
very common. In this study, the error introduced by memory and self-presentation bias is
noted but not thought to be substantially systematic. Causal inferences based on this study's
results must remain tentative. As we note in our discussion of the intergenerational
transmission of LHS and substance use, parent LHS cannot be understood as completely
exogenous to child life history traits due to genetic inheritance (i.e., LHS appears to be
heritable; Figueredo et al., 2004). Genes represent unmeasured variables that could cause
parent LHS and child life history traits. Future research can use genetic information to
address this potential confound.
Another limitation of this research is related to NLS97. The national survey was not
designed to test life history evolution. Because of this, we were not able to measure
fundamental dimensions of environment such as harshness and unpredictability (Ellis et al.,
2009). We did have access to an index of the quality of the home environment parents
maintained for children, but more extensive environmental measures would have added
important information to this study. We also relied on single indicators of several life
history domains. We expected that the use of a broad set of life history indicators would
allow us to locate the LHS construct centroids and recover the correct between-construct
parameter estimates (Little, Lindenberger, and Nesselroade, 1999). However, because a
single dimension did not emerge from our life history indicators, we relied on a single
indicator of health and did not partial out measurement error variance for this variable.
Because the assumption of zero error is often untenable, the estimates associated with
health should be interpreted with some caution. In this study, an adequate measure of the
use of uncommon illicit substances was not available. Although this study suggests that fast
LHS (or mating competition) is the primary driver of young adult substance use, it might be
the case that this latent variable does not predict the use of uncommon illicit substances to
the same extent that it predicts use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Future studies of the

linkages between LHS dimensions and substance use should examine data for the use of
other illicit substances. For now, inferences regarding uncommonly used illicit substances
should remain tentative.
Finally, our findings cast some uncertainty upon the identity of the latent constructs
we modeled. The pattern of results seems to suggest that substance use reflected young
adult mating competition and not where parents fell along a slow life history dimension
(i.e., delayed reproduction coupled with somatic and parental effort). However, these
findings must be interpreted with caution until additional research can bring more data to
bear on the dimensionality of life history traits and the potential mediating role of LHS in
the intergenerational transmission of substance use.
In spite of the limitations discussed, we believe this research has made important
contributions to the literature at the interface of human LHS and substance abuse etiology,
including some interesting questions and important directions for future research. In
addition, this work provides information that could be valuable to clinicians and
preventionists who intervene on substance abuse. Some major strengths of this study lie in
its careful use of these complex survey data, including the incorporation of complex
sampling weights, implementation of modern methods for handling missing data, and use
of sensitivity analyses at key methodological decision points. We hope that other life
history researchers will take advantage of existing nationally representative sets and that
this study spurs additional work at the interface of life history theory and substance use
etiology.
