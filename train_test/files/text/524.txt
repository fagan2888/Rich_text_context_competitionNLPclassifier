BACKGROUND: Cancer screening recommendations vary widely, especially for breast, prostate, and skin cancer screening. Guidelines
are provided by the American Cancer Society, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and various professional organizations. The rec-
ommendations often differ with regard to age and frequency of screening. The objective of this study was to determine actual rates
of screening in the primary care setting. METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used. Only adult
visits to non足federally employed, office-based physicians for preventive care from 2005 through 2010 were examined. Prevalence
rates for breast, pelvic, and rectal examinations were calculated, along with the rates for mammograms, Papanicolaou smears, and
prostate-specific antigen tests. Factors associated with screening, including age, race, smoking status, and insurance type, were
examined using t tests and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 8521 visits were examined. The rates of most screening examinations
and tests were stable over time. Clinical breast examinations took place significantly more than mammography was ordered (54.8%
vs 34.6%; P <.001). White patients received more mammography (P 5.031), skin examinations (P <.010), digital rectal examinations
(P <.010), and prostate-specific antigen tests (P 5.003) than patients of other races. Patients who paid with Medicare or private in-
surance received more screening than patients who had Medicaid or no insurance (P <.010). CONCLUSIONS: Current cancer screen-
ing practices in primary care vary significantly. Cancer screening may not follow evidence-based practices and may not be targeting
patients considered most at risk. Racial and socioeconomic disparities are present in cancer screening in primary care. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Guidelines for cancer screening in the primary care setting vary, especially with regard to breast, skin, and prostate exami-
nations. Recommendations for cervical screening are less controversial, although they are constantly evolving. Several
organizations, including the American Cancer Society (ACS), the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), and
major organizations within each field, offer recommendations guiding clinical care. The opinions of each professional
society's recommendations often differ with regard to age of initiation and discontinuation of screening, frequency of
screening, and screening tool.
Clinical breast examinations are recommended by the ACS and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol-
ogists (ACOG)1足3 but are not recommended by the USPSTF or the World Health Organization because of the risks of
anxiety and unnecessary biopsies.4,5 In contrast, all major organizations recommend mammography; however, contro-
versy exists with regard to the age of initiation. The USPSTF recommended against routine screening with mammography
in women aged <50 years in 2009,4 which resulted in significant controversy.
Screening for melanoma with routine skin examinations is recommended by the ACS.2 However, the USPSTF cites
insufficient evidence to support screening.6 The Institute of Medicine and the American Academy of Dermatology recom-
mend screening for those at high risk, including older, white men.8,9 Professional dermatology organizations are con-
stantly examining this issue, attempting to provide better evidence of the benefit of routine screening.
Prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test and digital rectal examination (DRE) is no
longer recommended by the American Urologic Association (AUA). Instead, the AUA recommends shared decision-

making for PSA screening in men ages 55 to 69 years
based on possible harms of over-diagnosis and overtreat-
ment.9 Before this recommendation, the AUA had recom-
mended routine annual screening with the PSA test.10
The USPSTF recommends against either the PSA test or
DRE.11 In contrast, the ACS continues to recommend
annual screening with the PSA test, but does not require
the DRE.2
Although strong evidence supports the ACOG,
ACS, and USPSTF guidelines outlining the pathways of
screening for cervical cancer using cytology,2,12,13 the
evidence does not support routine use of the pelvic exami-
nation for screening purposes. Its annual use is recom-
mended by the ACOG, although the ACOG
acknowledges the lack of evidence for its use alone in the
asymptomatic patient.12 It is recommended against by the
USPSTF for ovarian cancer screening.14
In this study, we examine the most recent data repre-
senting the rates of screening examinations currently con-
ducted in a nationally representative population of
primary care practices. We compare the rates of examina-
tions that are and are not recommended, and we also
examine the factors that influence screening rates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Sur-
vey, a publicly available survey conducted by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, was used. We exam-
ined only visits to non足federally employed, office-based
physicians (general, family practice, and internal medicine
groups) for nonillness care and preventive care from 2005
through 2010 in adult patients aged 18 years. Visits
were limited to routine physical examinations and general
medical examinations. We excluded pregnant patients
who were undergoing prenatal follow-up, and we also
excluded any visits related to injuries. The rates of breast
examinations and mammography were examined only
among women aged >40 years, pelvic examinations and
Papanicolaou (Pap) smears were examined among women
ages 18 to 70 years, and DRE and PSA tests were exam-
ined among men ages 50 to 75 years. The rate of skin
examinations was examined in patients aged 18 years
and again in patients aged 50 years, because there are no
guidelines for the age at which skin examinations should
begin. The ranges were based on current screening
recommendations.
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data
provide information from the nation's largest study of
ambulatory care provided at physicians' offices. Partici-
pants are composed of office-based physicians randomly
selected from information obtained from the American
Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Asso-
ciation. The US Census Bureau acts as the field data-
collection agent. Participants provide data through the
use of survey instruments on 30 randomly selected patient
visits during a randomly assigned, 1-week reporting pe-
riod. Thirty visits are used from each physician to equalize
reporting levels among the sample regardless of practice
size. The data are collected either by the physician or by
the physician's staff; although, in 51.5% of visits during
2009, for example, data were collected by Census field
representatives trained in data collection. The field staff
also makes completeness checks. In addition, manual cler-
ical edits, during which ambiguous entries are reclassified
or recoded, are performed upon the receipt of data for
central processing. Computer edits for code ranges and
inconsistencies also are performed. Error rates for coding
range between 0% and 1%, depending on the survey
item. Item nonresponse rates are 5%. Imputations are
performed for missing data.15
The survey instrument varies slightly from year to
year but includes the following data: patient date of visit;
zip code; birth date; sex; ethnicity; race; source of pay-
ment; tobacco use; medical history; vital signs, including
height and weight; whether the visit is related to an injury
or poisoning; whether the provider is the primary care
physician or whether the provider has seen the patient
before; the reason for the visit; the primary diagnosis or
diagnoses; diagnostic tests, including physical examina-
tion, imaging, and blood tests; the procedures, health edu-
cation, nonmedication treatment, medications, or
immunizations provided; type of provider; time spent
with the provider; and follow-up. All items are multiple-
choice except for medications and immunizations, which
may be written in by the provider. The questionnaire and
related documentation are available online .16
We calculated the prevalence rate for each of the
examinations and tests among eligible visits per year. We
used the Fisher exact test to compare the prevalence across
years. We compared the prevalence of examinations from
2008 to 2010 with those from 2005 to 2007. In addition,
we examined the factors associated with whether or not
each of the examinations took place. These included age,
ethnicity, race, sex, smoking status, source of payment
(Medicaid and self-pay vs Medicare and private insur-
ance), practitioner type (MD or DO vs nurse practitioner
or physician assistant), and the number of chronic medical
conditions. Race was divided into 4 groups: white, black,
Asian, and other, which included American Indian, native
Alaskan, native Hawaiian, or other Pacific Islander.

Ethnicity was defined as Hispanic or Latino and non-
Hispanic or non-Latino. Age and the number of chronic
medical conditions were examined continuously. We
used t tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests
for categorical variables to examine the influence of each
variable on each screening test or examination. The signif-
icance level was set at P < .05. Statistical analyses were
conducted using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) sta-
tistical software package (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The prevalence rate of clinical breast examinations among
eligible visits was significantly higher than that of mam-
mography (54.8% vs 34.6%; P < .001). The rate of pelvic
examinations did not significantly differ from that of Pap
smears (P 5 .087). PSA tests were ordered significantly
more often than rectal examinations were conducted
(33.1% vs 23%; P < .001). The rate of breast examina-
tions and pelvic examinations did not differ significantly
(P 5 .125). Mammography was ordered significantly less
often than Pap smears were conducted (P < .001). The
rates of all screening tests or examinations were signifi-
cantly higher than skin examinations among individuals
aged 18 years (26.2%; P < .001), skin examinations
among those aged >50 years (27.8%; P < .001), and rec-
tal examinations (23%; P < .001), which did not differ in
prevalence from one another (P 5 .106) (Fig. 1).
The rate of pelvic examinations decreased over time,
with 59.9% prevalence at visits during 2005 to 2007 ver-
sus 56.7% prevalence during 2008 to 2010 (P 5 .016).
The rate of skin examinations in adults aged 18 years
increased over time from 25.1% to 27.1% (P 5 .032). It
is noteworthy that this increase was most pronounced
among patients aged 50 years, for whom the prevalence
increased from 26.2% to 29.3% (P 5 .013). The preva-
lence of clinical breast examinations, mammography, Pap
smears, rectal examinations, and PSA tests did not differ
significantly across years (Fig. 2).
When examining age, younger patients (mean age,
46 years) received more clinical breast examinations than
older patients (mean age, 50.6 years; P < .001), whereas
older patients had mammography ordered more than
younger patients (mean age, 53.7 years vs 47.6 years,
respectively; P < .001). Older patients had more DREs
done (mean age, 52.1 years vs 47.8 years; P < .001) and
PSAs drawn (mean age, 59.9 years vs 47.9 years;
P < .001) than younger patients. Younger patients had
more pelvic examinations (mean age, 44.8 years vs 51.3
years; P < .001) and Pap smears done (mean age, 44.8
years vs 51.4 years; P < .001) than older patients. Patients
with a higher number of chronic medical conditions
(mean 6 standard deviation: 1.94 6 1.08 conditions)
received Pap smears less often than those with a lower
number of conditions (mean 6 standard deviation:
1.63 6 0.91 conditions; P < .001). There were no differ-
ences with regard to the number of chronic medical con-
ditions for clinical breast examinations, mammograms,
DREs, PSA tests, pelvic examinations, Pap smears, or skin
examinations (Table 1).
White patients received more skin examinations or
DREs than black, Asian, or other patients (all P < .001).
Figure 1. Overall prevalence rates of cancer screening from
2005-2010. Prevalence rates between types of screening
were compared. The rate of breast exams in visits with female
patients over 40 was significantly higher than mammography
(P < 0.001). PSA was drawn in males 50-75 significantly more
than rectal exams were conducted (P < 0.001). Mammo indi-
cates mammogram; Pap, Papanicolau; PSA, prsotate-specific
antigen.

rate of exams has remained relatively stable. Pelvic exams
were less prevalent in 2008-2010 vs. 2005-2007 (P 5 0.02);
and skin exams are more prevalent in 2008-2010 vs. 2005-
2007 (P 5 0.03). Mammo indicates mammography; PAP, Pa-

Non-Hispanic, non-Latino patients received more skin
examinations or DREs than Hispanic or Latino patients
(P 5 .012 and P 5 .001, respectively). White and Asian
patients also had mammography ordered (P 5 .031) and
PSA drawn (P 5 .003) more than black and other
patients. Non-Hispanic, non-Latino patients also had
mammography ordered (P 5 .014) and PSA drawn
(P < .001) more than Hispanic or Latino patients. There
were no differences with regard to race or ethnicity for
clinical breast examinations (Table 2).
Nonsmokers received more skin examinations
(P 5 .003), breast examinations (P < .001), pelvic exami-

than smokers. They also had mammograms and
(P 5 .002) and Pap smears (P 5 .022). There was no dif-
ference with regard to smoking status for patients who
had PSA drawn (Fig. 3). Patients received more skin
examinations (P 5 .017), rectal examinations (P 5 .031),
Pap smears (P 5 .002), or mammograms (P 5 .008) by

cians (Table 3). There was no difference with regard to

more screening than patients who had Medicaid or no in-

DISCUSSION
Our study validates the disparity that exists in cancer
screening with regard to race and socioeconomic status.
Numerous studies have addressed this issue,17足22 espe-
cially in recent years as the debate regarding universal
health care has made its way to the national foreground.
Studies have demonstrated that this disparity is mini-
mized or does not exist in systems with universal access to
care.23,24 We observed that white patients received all
screening examinations and tests significantly more fre-
quently than black, Asian, Hispanic, and other patients.
These findings are in line with numerous studies demon-
strating a lack of access to care among nonwhites,25 stigma
preventing certain cultures from seeking routine medical
care like gynecologic screening,26,27 and distrust and mis-
understanding of the US medical system among particular
ethnic groups.28 Many studies have demonstrated
increased mortality for black patients with skin, breast,
prostate, and cervical cancers compared with their white
counterparts.17,18,24,29 This is especially worrisome for
black men with prostate cancer, for whom studies indicate
that mortality is 2 to 3 times higher than for white
men.30,31 Newer studies demonstrate this disparity not
only with black patients but also with southeast Asian
and Hispanic patients.32 Those studies demonstrate why
finding solutions to closing these gaps is especially
imperative.
Not only did we observe a large disparity with regard
to race and ethnicity, but our findings also confirmed the
role of insurance in cancer screening. Patients who were
paying with private insurance or Medicare were far more
likely to receive all examinations and tests than patients
who were paying with Medicaid or who were without in-
surance. When we excluded patients without insurance,
the results were similar. Medicare coverage is considered
by many to be superior to Medicaid programs because of
accessibility, selection of providers, and reimbursement
rates.33 Although both programs theoretically cover rec-
ommended cancer screening examinations, our data sug-
gest that the screening of patients with Medicaid falls

short. This is line with studies documenting the impor-
tance of insurance on cancer screening.34
Many of our findings are consistent with current rec-
ommendations. This is especially true with regard to age.
The mean age for starting clinical breast examinations
was 46 years, whereas that for starting mammography was
51 years. Recommendations from the ACS suggest that
yearly breast examinations and mammograms should
begin at age >40 years.1,2 Although the USPSTF does not
recommend breast examinations, it does suggest that
mammograms begin at age 50 years.4 The mean ages for
starting DREs and PSA tests were 52 years and 60 years,
respectively, which fell well within the commonly recom-
mended age range of 50 to 75 years.35,36 In the era of cost-
effective medicine, however, it may become increasingly
important to act based on strict evidence based-
recommendations. A recent National Ambulatory Health
Care (NAMCS) study demonstrated that many services,
including breast and prostate screening, continue to be
over utilized.37
One such screening measure may include clinical
breast examinations, the rate of which was higher than
that for mammography, despite research suggesting no
additional mortality benefit with clinical breast examina-
tions.38 The sensitivity of detecting breast cancers with
mammogram versus mammogram plus clinical breast ex-
amination is similar; however clinical breast examinations
lead to higher rates of false-positive results.39 Because of
such evidence, the USPSTF does not recommend routine
clinical breast examinations.40 They are still recom-
mended, however, by the ACS and the ACOG,1,3 likely
based on slight gains in sensitivity of detection.
In our study, the rate of pelvic examinations did not
differ significantly from that of Pap smears. Although the
definition of a pelvic examination is not entirely clear
from NAMCS data, we interpreted this as distinct from a
Pap smear, entailing an external visualization, speculum
examination, and=or bimanual pelvic examination for use
in cervical and ovarian cancer screening.12 Whereas cytol-
ogy with a Pap smear is routinely recommended by most
professional organizations every 3 years,12,13,41 evidence
supporting the role of pelvic examinations is lacking.42
Despite this, our study is similar to a recent study of US
gynecologists demonstrating that screening with bima-
nual pelvic examinations is performed routinely. Forty-
seven percent of survey participants in that study cited
detection of ovarian cancer as the reason for performing
the examination.43 The evidence indicates that the likeli-
hood of detecting ovarian cancer with screening is so low
that it is recommended against by the USPSTF.14 In addi-
tion, pelvic examinations often are associated with signifi-
cant embarrassment, discomfort, and anxiety.44 Our data
indicate perhaps some concordance with such evidence, as
the rate of pelvic examinations is slowly declining.
Despite the rising incidence of melanoma,45,46 skin
cancer screening is currently not recommended by the
USPSTF because of a lack of evidence of mortality bene-
fit.6,47 However, it is recommended by the ACS.2 Skin can-
cer screening by primary care physicians is not routinely
provided.48 More recent evidence suggests, however, that
physician detection is associated with thinner melanomas
and a significant survival advantage.7,49 Although our data
demonstrate that skin cancer screening has significantly
increased over a 10-year period, the rates of other examina-
tions that similarly lack evidence of mortality benefit,
including breast and pelvic examinations,39,42 continue to
be significantly higher than the rate for skin cancer screen-
ing. This is consistent with findings from a NAMCS study
that examined skin cancer screening in 1997.50
Lack of time is commonly cited as a reason why
screening is not performed,51 particularly for skin, breast,
and prostate cancers.52足55 To our surprise, the number of
chronic medical conditions did not seem to have a signifi-
cant influence on the rate of examinations or tests. This
was true in all cases except Pap smears, for which a higher
number of chronic medical conditions meant a lower rate
of examinations. This may be explained by our inclusion
of only routine physical examinations in our study, which
may not have addressed the management of chronic
issues. However, this result is still promising. According
to our study, a patient's complex medical history does not
preclude conducting recommended routine cancer screen-
ing in the setting of scheduled preventive visits. This is in
contrast to other studies, which have indicated that
patients with chronic conditions may experience neglect
of unrelated disorders during primary care visits.56
Also unexpected in our study was the finding that
smokers were less likely to be screened than nonsmokers.
It is well established that smoking is a risk factor for and
plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of most can-
cers.57 It is possible that smokers were screened less often
because of the presence of additional comorbidities associ-
ated with smoking58,59 as well as the extra time it may
have taken to counsel smoking cessation.60 Smokers may
also be less likely to consult physicians for preventive
health maintenance visits. Regardless of the reason, this
finding highlights a need for the risk stratification of
patients who require screening. For example, although
routine skin cancer screening is not recommended, evi-
dence suggests that screening in at-risk populations, such
Original Article
258 Cancer January 15, 2014
as elderly white men, is likely to yield a significant mortal-
ity benefit compared with screening all patients.7 Risk
stratification should be based on other factors as well,
such as family history.61
Our study also demonstrates the changing role of
the physician in the practice of primary care. Significantly
more screening examinations and tests took place when
the visit was conducted by a nurse practitioner or a physi-
cian assistant rather than by a physician. Nurse practi-
tioners and physician assistants conducted routine
screening examinations more often than physicians,
whereas physicians addressed more acute complaints and
chronic illness visits. This speaks to the expanding role of
nurse practitioners and physician assistants in primary
care.62 More and more practices, not only in the commu-
nity but at academic centers as well, are integrating non-
physician practitioners as part of an effort to address the
primary care shortage. The role of the nurse practitioner is
not clearly defined.63,64 Our study documents the increas-
ing importance of nonphysician practitioners in providing
preventive care and demonstrates an area in which the
efforts of physician assistants and nurse practitioners may
be especially realized.
Limitations of this study are related to our use of data
from a publicly available survey instrument. The survey
form is completed by the provider, provider staff, or
NAMCS field staff. Variables in the survey form were
largely objective, because they were based on data from the
visit. Although this helps to minimize some bias tradition-
ally associated with questionnaires administered to patients,
survey of the providers may be associated with variability in
how the survey form was completed. For example, some
may have completed forms during or immediately after the
visit, whereas others may have completed them at a later
time, making the data more prone to recall bias. Providers
also knew they were being observed during the week of vis-
its and may have altered their clinical behavior, whether
intentional or not. In addition, we were limited by the data
available from the survey form. We would have liked to
include data regarding colon cancer screening; however,
the survey form did not explicitly collect data for fecal
occult blood tests, sigmoidoscopy, or gastrointestinal refer-
ral. Although the survey form did collect data for colono-
scopy, in our preliminary analysis, we observed that it was
seldom ordered. We hypothesized that this was because of
the recommendation for routine colonoscopy only every
10 years and the availability of flexible sigmoidoscopy as an
acceptable alternative to colonoscopy for cancer screen-
ing.65 It is also a procedure that is not consistently ordered
by primary care providers themselves but, rather, upon
referral to gastroenterology. We included only screening
examinations and tests in our study that were likely done or
ordered by the provider at the time of the primary care
visit.
Cancer screening is a key component of primary
care. The goal of cancer screening is to balance the risk of
diagnostic workup with mortality benefit. In our
population-based study representing primary care
practices across the United States, we identified trends in
cancer screening practices that have important implica-
tions for the practice and delivery of health care. It is im-
portant to document patterns of cancer screening to
identify areas of strength and areas that need significant
improvement.
