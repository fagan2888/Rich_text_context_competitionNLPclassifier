Background. Disability measures among elderly non-Hispanic White populations have traditionally been associated
with activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). More recently, performance-
based measures have increasingly been used to predict the onset of disability in initially nondisabled elderly populations.
Methods. We used data from two waves (1993-94 and 1995-96) of the Hispanic Established Populations for the
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) to assess the degree with which lower mobility performance measures
predict future disability in a representative sample of older Mexican Americans from the Southwestern United States.
Results. Performances on an 8-foot walk, repeated chair stands, and standing balance among nondisabled subjects at
baseline were significantly associated with the onset of ADL and lower body disability 2 years later, controlling for
age, gender, and the presence of medical conditions. The results were significant for each performance measure and for
a measure combining all three.
Conclusion. This study offers further evidence that performance-based measures of lower body function are able to
predict future disability in older Mexican Americans, as has been found with other elderly populations. These measures
were able to detect changes over a relatively short period of time (2 years). In addition, the study found that the short
(8-foot) walk was the most sensitive measure in predicting future disability.
S the ability to perform normal daily tasks diminishes
with advancing age (1-2), dependence on others may
increase. Reduced independence or loss of independence has
been associated with certain medical conditions such as
arthritis (3-6), diabetes (7), hip fracture (3-4,8), cancer (5),
heart disease (3-4), obesity (9), and stroke (4,10); it has also
been linked to future institutionalization and death (11-12).
Disability among elderly people has traditionally been
associated with self-report measures that are grouped into
two categories: activities of daily living (ADLs) and instru-
mental activities of daily living (IADLs). In more recent
years, objective assessments of physical functioning have
become more common in studies of older people (12,13).
Performance-based measures offer several advantages over
self-reports including increased validity and reproducibility
(14); less influence from culture, language, and education
(14); and greater suitability in assessing function in both
disabled and nondisabled individuals. Thus, they provide
physicians with the ability to detect deteriorating physical
function among nondisabled persons including the emer-
gence of subsequent ADL dependency (12,15-16).
Guralnik and colleagues (15) demonstrated that physical
performance measures provide useful preliminary knowl-
edge about healthy elderly persons who report little to no
disability. Much of the performance-based research, how-
ever, has focused on non-Hispanic White populations with
little attention given to minorities. It is not entirely clear
whether elderly Mexican Americans will perform in a man-
ner comparable to non-Hispanic Whites (17). For example,
Mexican Americans report higher rates of certain chronic
health conditions such as diabetes and obesity, which have
been associated with greater disability.
This analysis attempts to replicate Guralnik and col-
leagues' study (15), which found that simple performance-
based measures of lower mobility functioning predicted
future disability in an elderly non-Hispanic White popula-
tion. Our hypothesis is that lower mobility performance
measures in nondisabled Mexican Americans aged 65 and
older will predict the onset of ADL- and mobility-related
disabilities over a 2-year period.
METHODS
Sample.--Data employed are from the 1993-94 His-
panic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Stud-
ies of the Elderly (EPESE), a population-based study of
3,050 noninstitutionalized Mexican Americans aged 65-99
from five Southwestern states: Texas, California, New
Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona (17). This study was mod-
eled after earlier EPESE surveys that began in the 1980s in
New Haven, CT, East Boston, MA, North Carolina, and
rural Iowa (18). A multistage area probability sampling
design was used, assuring a sample representative of at
least 85% of Mexican Americans aged 65 and older in the
Southwestern United States. The sample is generalizable to
approximately 500,000 Mexican Americans (17). The re-
sponse rate at baseline (1993-94) was 86%. Of the 3,050
subjects, 2,873 were interviewed in person and 177 (5.8%)

by proxy. At the follow-up interview (1995-96), 2,167 per-
sons were reinterviewed in person and another 272 (8.9%)
persons were reinterviewed by proxy. Of the remaining
subjects, 224 (7.3%) were deceased, 109 (3.5%) refused to
be reinterviewed, 5 (0.2%) moved to Mexico, and 273
(8.9%) could not be located.
The present analyses included persons who reported no
baseline disability in ADLs--bathing, using the toilet,
transferring from bed to chair, and walking across a small
room--and reported that they were capable of walking a
half mile and climbing stairs without help. At baseline
(1993-94) there were 1,946 subjects who met these criteria,
of whom 1,365 completed the follow-up 2 years later
(1995-96). The average age of this group was 73.3 years,
with 53% being female. Of these, 725 (53%) reported no
chronic conditions, 496 (36%) reported one chronic condi-
tion, 127 (9%) persons reported two, and 17 (1.9%) re-
ported three or more conditions out of a possible four (heart
problems, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis).
Assessment.--Lower mobility function for this group of
nondisabled elderly Mexican Americans was assessed with
three independent measures: timed repetitive chair stands, a
timed walk across a small room (8-foot walk), and standing
balance (12,15). The 8-foot walk was timed twice to the
nearest second with the faster of the two walks used for
scoring purposes. Scores for the sample were divided into
quartiles. A timing of > 9.0 sec received a score of 1; 6.0 to
8.0 sec a score of 2; 4.0 to 5.0 sec a score of 3; and < 3.0
sec a score of 4.
Scores for the five timed repetitive chair stands were cal-
culated to the nearest tenth of a second among those who
demonstrated that they were first capable of standing once
from a sitting position with arms folded across their chest.
These scores were also divided into quartiles, with a score
of 1 assigned to those who completed the task in > 16.5 sec,
a score of 2 for 13.6 to 16.4 sec, a score of 3 for 11.0 to
13.5 sec, and a score of 4 for < 10.9 sec.
The standing balance test included three tasks of increas-
ing difficulty. To advance to the next level of difficulty, the
preceding level needed to be successfully completed. The
first task required individuals to stand with their feet in a
side-by-side position; the second task asked participants to
stand with their feet in a semi-tandem position in which the
heel of one foot was placed beside the big toe of the other
foot; the third task required a tandem position in which the
heel of one foot was placed directly in front of the other
foot. A score of 1 was recorded if both the side-by-side
position and the semi-tandem position were held success-
fully for 10 sec; a score of 2 if the tandem position was
held for greater than 2 sec and less than 10 sec; and a score
of 3 if the tandem position was held for 10 sec.
In addition, an overall lower body function score was
calculated by summing the three individual scores--8-foot
walk, chair stands, and balance test. Total summed scores
for individuals ranged from a low of 1 to a high of 11.
A tiered performance scale for each performance mea-
sure was used to group the nondisabled elderly Mexican
Americans at baseline into one of three categories at fol-
low-up: (a) no disability; (b) mobility-related disability
only (the inability to walk a half mile or climb stairs with-
out help); or (c) ADL disability (with or without mobility-
related disability).
The Mantel-Haenszel chi-square statistic was used to test
the bivariate association between lower mobility perfor-
mance at baseline and disability at follow-up. A multiple
logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associa-
tion of each individual performance measure and of the
total performance score with disability at follow-up adjust-
ing for age, sex, and number of chronic conditions. All sta-
tistical analyses used the SAS statistical software package.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the association of the three lower mobility
performance measures at baseline with disability at the 2-
year follow-up. Persons with higher scores on the 8-foot
walk or repeated chair stands were less likely to report dis-
ability at follow-up compared to those with lower scores.
Similar trends were evident for the standing balance perfor-
mance measure. Individuals who were more successful at
baseline were more likely to be disability-free at follow-up,
whereas those who encountered more difficulty with the
baseline task were more likely to experience ADL- and/or
mobility-related disability at follow-up.
Table 2 shows the results of separate logistic regression
analyses of ADL and mobility-related disability at follow-
up, by performance on the timed 8-foot walk, chair stands,
and standing balance. The table shows a linear association
between performance on the timed walk and subsequent
disability. For example, the odds of becoming ADL-depen-
dent over the 2-year period were 5.4 for those in category 1
(slowest), 4.3 in category 2, 3.6 in category 3 when com-
pared to category 4 (fastest). The respective odds were 3.4,
2.6, and 2.1 for mobility-related disability. Performance on
the repeated chair stands was also associated linearly with
subsequent disability; however, the association was not as
strong as for the timed walk. A similar relationship was
found between performance on standing balance and ADL-
or mobility-related disability at follow-up. However, the
increased odds for disability associated with poorer perfor-
mance on standing balance were not always significant,
possibly because this variable is so highly skewed.
As also reported by Guralnik and colleagues (15), scores
on the three individual measures were summed to provide a
combined scale. Higher scores indicate better performance,
with a score of 9--11 used as the reference in the logistic
regression analysis given in Table 3. For both models the
odds of ADL- or mobility-related disabilities 2 years later
increased as scores decreased. For example, the odds of
being ADL-dependent were 6.2 among those in the lowest
summary performance category, and 2.0 among those in the
5 to 8 summary performance category. The odds of mobil-
ity-related disability with a summary score of 1 to 4 was
4.8, and 2.4 for those who scored in the 5 to 8 range.
DISCUSSION
Older Mexican Americans represent a unique and rapidly
growing segment of the population, but there is relatively
little health information available on this group. Using data
from the Hispanic EPESE, the first large-scale study of the

*8-foot walk and repeated chair stands are timed baseline performance measures. Score categories ranged from 1-4, with 4 being the fastest. The timed
8-foot walk categories are divided by quartiles to the nearest second. The chair stand categories are divided by quartiles to the nearest tenth of a second.
fThe standing balance test is a baseline performance measure. Scoring ranged from 1-3, with 3 being the best. The standing balance test categories are
grouped by increasing level of difficulty: side-by-side and semi-tandem, tandem, and full tandem.

health of older Mexican Americans, we provide evidence
that performance-based measures of lower body function are
able to predict the onset of disability among older Mexican
Americans, as has been demonstrated with other elderly pop-
ulations (15). Separate logistic regression models showed
that all three measures employed (8-foot walk, repeated chair
stands, and standing balance) were good predictors of both
ADL- and mobility-related disabilities over 2 years. In addi-
tion, our composite measure combining the three exhibited a
strong linear association with subsequent disability.
Perhaps of greater interest, the 8-foot walk appeared to
be an especially good indicator of future disability. Odds of
increasing magnitude for both ADL- and mobility-related
disabilities were associated with increased time to complete
the 8-foot walk. A similar result was reported in the Inter-
vention study of Elderly in Goteborg (IVEG), Sweden (19),
in which walking speed was the only measure that pre-
dicted dependence in ADLs for both elderly men and
women. Thus, this single measure may be useful for clini-
cians in assessing and predicting future disability among
elderly persons. In contrast, it appears that the least effec-
tive measure in predicting disability is the standing balance.
Hoeymans and colleagues (20) have also shown that the
standing balance test may not be a good performance mea-
sure for elderly people.
Despite the short length of follow-up in the present study
[2 years vs 4 in the Guralnik et al. study (15)], we were
able to detect significant changes in disability status at fol-
low-up. This is important because the disability process in
some elderly individuals has been shown to be reversible
when in an early and acute stage (19). Over time, however,
minor disabilities often become more severe or increase in
number, and, in turn, may lead to loss of independence
(21). Loss of independence is a major determinant of need
for supportive services such as nursing home care (22),
hospitalization (21), institutionalization (23), and ultimately
death (24).
The concept of preclinical disability has been described
by Fried et al. (25), who defined it as a time of increasing
impairment or disability in the absence of any recognition
of loss of performance by the individual. Thus, mobility-
related performance measures appear to be useful in iden-
tifying older persons who are at an increased risk of be-
coming disabled and perhaps dependent on others for
assistance. If disability can be delayed through timely inter-
ventions such as physical activity, which can maintain and

strengthen the body (26), then the number of disability-free
years or active life expectancy will increase.
With the population of those aged 65 and older in the
United States expected to increase to more than 50 million
people by the year 2020, the overall burden of disability
among the elderly population is likely to increase, resulting
in escalating reliance on health care services and resources.
Thus, prevention and reduction of disability should be a
primary goal of research focusing on furthering our under-
standing of how and why some elderly individuals have
less disability at follow-up compared to their baseline dis-
ability measures. Information collected from these individ-
uals may be beneficial in helping others prevent, delay, or
even reverse their disability. In addition, more precise mea-
sures could be developed that will be able to detect future
disability and that can also be administered as part of a
clinical examination. With improved diagnostic measure-
ment instruments and increased awareness by physicians of
the relevance of these measures, earlier detection of clinical
disability can be achieved. Better detection in turn may
help to lessen future disability and add to the number of
disability-free years among elderly people.
