Introduction
Coronary artery disease (CAD), including myocardial
infarction, is the leading cause of death and disability in the
world.1­3 One of the standard treatments for CAD is percu-
taneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement4;
however, a portion of the patients with PCI treatment suffer
in-stent restenosis (ISR), which is the main limitation of
coronary stenting.5 ISR is the formation of scar tissue over
the stent and can cause the opened artery to narrow again.
Although the incidence of was ISR reduced recently with
the application of new therapies, treatment of ISR remains
a challenging clinical issue.6
During the past decade, there has been increasing
scientific interest in understanding the complex rela-
tionship between coronary restenosis after PCI and the
Association of ACE insertion or deletion
polymorphisms with the risk of coronary
restenosis after percutaneous coronary
intervention: A meta-analysis

Abstract
Objective: Previous case-control studies on the relationship between the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene
insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphisms and coronary restenosis did not reach the same conclusion. In the present study,
we aimed to further evaluate the relationship between the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms and coronary restenosis, after
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
Methods: By searching PubMed, EMBase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database and Wanfang database, we
selected 16 case-control studies related to ACE gene I/D polymorphism and coronary restenosis after PCI. To test for
heterogeneity in each study, we utilized the Q-test and I2 test. To merge the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI, we utilized
the random effects model during the analyses.
Results: The present study included 4693 subjects: 1241 patients with coronary restenosis and 3452 without coronary
restenosis. By meta-analysis, we found there was significant association of ACE gene I/D polymorphism with coronary
restenosis (D allele versus I allele: OR = 1.92; 95% CI (1.40­2.43); p < 0.001). A subgroup analysis, by stratification
according to ethnicity, also showed that this association was found not only in the Caucasian population ((D allele versus
I allele: OR = 1.94; 95% CI (1.38­2.80); p < 0.001)), but also in the Asian population ((D allele versus I allele: OR = 1.83;
95% CI (1.05­3.20); p = 0.03)). After stratification according to age, we found that the D allele carriers have a higher risk
for development of coronary restenosis in subjects < 60 years old (OR = 2.13; 95% CI: 1.40­3.24; p = 0.0004); while in the
subjects  60 years old, the association was present with bordering significance (OR = 1.48; 95%CI: 0.98­2.25; p = 0.06).
Conclusions: The present study suggested that the ACE gene I/D polymorphism was associated with coronary
restenosis, regardless of age and ethnicity.

renin-angiotensin system (RAS).7­9 The RAS plays an
important role in blood pressure and cardiovascular
homeostasis10,11; and recently-published data indicate
that angiotensin II, the main biologically-active peptide
of RAS, contributes to coronary restenosis develop-
ment and progression.12,13 The production of angioten-
sin II is regulated by ACE, which has serum levels
governed by genetic variation at the ACE locus.
Previous studies indicate that certain genetic polymor-
phisms are recognized to be associated with the risk of
coronary restenosis.14­19 Among these genes, the ACE
gene polymorphisms were considered as a risk factor of
coronary restenosis in several published papers20­34;
however, the results of these studies were inconsistent.
Rebrova et al.34 found that ACE genetic polymorphism
is associated with coronary restenosis risk. Guneri
et al.32 and Okumura et al.33 also confirmed the previ-
ous studies; however, Martínez-Ríos et al.35 did not
find any association between ACE gene insertion/dele-
tion (I/D) polymorphisms and coronary restenosis risk.
Therefore, we collected all published case-control
studies related to the ACE I/D polymorphisms and cor-
onary restenosis risk to perform a meta-analysis, to fur-
ther explore the relationship between ACE gene
polymorphisms and coronary restenosis.
Materials and methods
Literature collection and screening
We identified all the articles that reported the association
of ACE polymorphisms and coronary restenosis risk. We
conducted a computerized literature search of PubMed,
EMBase, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, the
Chinese CNKI, and the Wanfang database; using the terms
`coronary restenosis'and `angiotensin-converting enzyme'
or `ACE', and `polymorphism' or single nucleotide poly-
morphism (`SNP'), or `genotype', or `insertion/deletion'
or `I/D', or `D/I', `D/D' or `I/I'; without any restriction on
language or publication year. We expected that the included
studies must meet to the following criteria:
·
· Case-control or cohort studies on the relation
between ACE polymorphism and coronary
restenosis;
·
· Similar themes and methods; and
·
· Sufficient data upon genotype and alleles counts.
Literature were excluded if relevant data were not availa-
ble or there was heterogeneity of gene polymorphisms in
the control population.
Quality assessment and data extraction
Two reviewers (H-W Miao and H Gong) used a standard
approach, according to the above-mentioned inclusion cri-
teria, independently evaluating the studies and extracting
the data (Table 1). Discrepancies were resolved through
discussion. The methodological quality of the included
studies was assessed by using the Cochrane Handbook
5.236 quality evaluation criteria. We extracted the following
information for each study: The first author's last name,
year of publication, ethnicity of the study participants,
numbers of cases and controls, and frequency of insertion
or deletion genotypes. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was
assessed, using the 2 test.

Statistical analysis
We used RevMan 5.2 software, provided by the Cochrane
Collaboration, to perform the meta-analysis. We used
Q-test and I2 test to examine the heterogeneity between
each study. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% CI were uti-
lized for efficacy analysis statistics. We selected either the
fixed or random-effects model, to merge the OR according
to the I2 value. Sensitivity analyses and publication bias
tests were performed according to previous literature. We
considered a P < 0.05 as a significant difference.
Results
Study identification
As shown in Figure 1, we preliminarily detected 144 arti-
cles in the literature: 104 were excluded, because of only
gene expression analysis not relevant to coronary resteno-
sis, and no ACE genotype data; and 24 studies were further
excluded because of being only a review paper, no control
group, and/or being duplicate publications. Therefore, a
total of 16 journal literature articles,20­35 with a total of
4693 subjects (1241 patients with coronary restenosis and
3452 subjects without coronary restenosis), were included
in this research.
Quantitative synthesis
As shown in Figure 2, the heterogeneity test of the vari-
ous studies revealed there were heterogeneous results
(I2 = 77%; p < 0.0001); therefore, we used the random
effects model in our analysis. We found a significant
difference between ACE I/D polymorphisms and the
risk for coronary restenosis. The D allele carriers had a
1.92-fold increased risk for coronary restenosis, com-
pared to the I allele carriers (OR = 1.92; 95% CI 1.40­
2.63; p < 0.001).Also, subgroup analysis by stratification
according to ethnicity (Figure 3) showed that this asso-
ciation was found not only in the Caucasian population
((D allele versus I allele: OR = 1.94; 95% CI (1.38­
2.80); p < 0.001)), but also in the Asian population ((D
allele versus I allele: OR = 1.83; 95% CI (1.05­3.20); p
= 0.03)). After stratification according to age (Figure 4),
we found that D allele carriers have a higher risk for
development of coronary restenosis in subjects < 60
years old (OR = 2.13; 95%CI: 1.40­3.24; p = 0.0004);
while in subjects with  60 years of age, the association
was present at a borderline significance (OR = 1.48;
95%CI: 0.98­2.25; p = 0.06).
Publication bias analysis
RevMan 5.0 software was used to analyze the publication
bias; a funnel plot (Figure 5) showed that the points were
evenly distributed and symmetrical, and most of the points
were within the 95% CI. The shape of the funnel plots
showed no obvious asymmetry. The result of Egger's test
did not show statistical evidence for bias. It indicated that
there was no publication bias and that the result of the
study is credible.
Sensitivity analysis
We deleted one single study from the overall pooled analy-
sis each time, to check the influence of the removed data

Discussion
In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to eval-
uate the association of ACE gene I/D polymorphisms with
coronary restenosis. We found a significant association of
ACE gene polymorphisms with coronary restenosis.
Restenosis after PCI is an important clinical problem.
The formation of restenosis may result from the following
mechanisms:
·
· A response to injury of the vessel wall;
·
· A platelet aggregation;
·
· A thrombus formation;
·
· A liberation of growth factors;
·
· Cellular hyperplasia involving predominantly
smooth muscle proliferation and migration; and
·
· Intercellular matrix formation.
So far, the etiological basis of restenosis is only partly
understood. The genetic polymorphisms in the ACE gene
are considered to be associated with coronary restenosis.
ACE is a core factor for the production of angiotensin II;
and the degradation of bradykinin37 and angiotensin II
plays a pivotal role in the restenosis process.38 Previous
studies indicate that high ACE levels may increase the
risk of coronary thrombosis.39 And ACE gene I/D poly-
morphisms have consistently been found associated with
differential plasma ACE levels.40 Furthermore, serum
plasma activity of ACE is thought to play a major role in
the development of restenosis after coronary stent implan-
tation.41,42 Recently, a number of articles in the literature
reported on the relationship between ACE I/D polymor-
phisms and coronary restenosis risk20­35; however, the
results are inconsistent or even contradictory. This dis-
crepancy may result from the small sample size, ethnic
difference, false positive results, and/or study design in
each study.
In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to
reveal the association of ACE I/D polymorphisms with
coronary restenosis. Our results showed thatACE gene I/D
polymorphisms were associated with the susceptibility of
coronary restenosis, with the D allele carriers having a
1.92-fold increase in risk for restenosis, compared to the I
allele carriers; however, there is still a need for further
research and screening of the etiological relationships
between the functional polymorphism loci of the ACE
gene and the susceptibility to coronary restenosis.
There are still several limitations, when interpreting
these results. On the one hand, all the subjects involved in
our study are of different ethnicity. On the other hand, the
heterogeneity found between each study may result from
the different research methods.
In conclusion, the present study suggested that there is
an association between the ACE gene I/D polymorphisms
and coronary restenosis.
