Introduction
Residential segregation and the unequal distribution of life
chances that it may engender pose a major challenge for
contemporary welfare states because an immigration policy
that does not provide equal opportunities to recent and estab-
lished citizens is a failed one. Social scientists are increas-
ingly interested in trying to establish residential segregation
as a fact and investigating its short- and long-term conse-
quences. One highly influential concept in this literature is
that of the neighborhood, and particularly that of neighbor-
hood effects. Originally developed in the context of inner
cities in the United States, it is increasingly being applied in
Scandinavian research as well. In an attempt to argue the
underlying mechanisms of neighborhood effects, various
analysts have proposed that people's everyday social inter-
action is so intrinsically nested within neighborhood that the
neighborhood effect can actually be interpreted as a social
interaction effect, or even as a social network effect. In this
article, we set out to scrutinize this assumption by studying
the friendships of ninth graders in three different schools by
asking how their circles of close friends are constituted with
respect to sex, ethnicity, school class, and neighborhood.
The research question we ask in this study is as follows:
Research Question 1: To what extent is it theoreti-
cally and empirically justified to use neighborhood
effects as a proxy for social interaction effects or
even social networks effects?
The objective is to contribute to a better specification of the
underlying mechanisms that bring about neighborhood
effects. We do not doubt that neighborhood effects exist and
that they are important to study; it is reasonable to assume
that neighborhoods sometimes influence people's life chances
substantially, and such effects have been observed empiri-
cally. Yet, sociologists should strive to open up the black box
of neighborhood effects to determine precisely what in neigh-
borhoods is causing systematic differences in social out-
comes (such as schooling and labor-market situation). If they
fail to do this, they will only produce explanations of rather
low explanatory value (see Boudon, 1998); that is, they can
show if neighborhoods have an effect on social outcomes, but
not why. If we want to go beyond prediction and also offer
sound sociological explanations, this is certainly an unsatis-
fying situation (Elster, 2007; Hedström, 2005).1

Abstract
The social surroundings in which an individual grows up and spends his or her everyday life have an effect on his or her
life chances. Much of the research into this phenomenon focuses on so-called neighborhood effects and has put particular
emphasis on the negative effects of growing up in a poor neighborhood. Originating from the sociological study of inner-city
problems in the United States, the research has recently been embraced by Scandinavian social scientists, who have generally
assessed the phenomenon with reference to social network effects and the lock-in effects of ethnic enclaves.We critique
the theoretical assumptions that we find in recent Scandinavian research and argue that a straightforward interpretation of
neighborhood effects in terms of network effects is problematic.Our argument is based on an empirical analysis of friendship
circles of ninth graders in Stockholm (N = 240).We conclude that the friendship networks of ninth graders extend well
beyond the neighborhood, thus casting serious doubt on the network effects assumption of previous research. We also
conclude that there is nothing in the reality of these ninth graders that confirms the established concept of the ethnic enclave.

or racial or ethnic characteristics, is a common feature of all
industrialized societies. People who grow up in circum-
stances where most of their neighbors are poor are less
likely, for instance, to be successful in school and in their
work lives. This situation has led social scientists to ask
whether there are specific neighborhood characteristics--
going beyond individual and family characteristics--that can
explain this phenomenon. The claim is that the social sur-
roundings matter for people's life chances. This is a socio-
logically appealing claim that makes a lot of sense intuitively
and has inspired considerable research on so-called neighbor-
hood effects, focusing in particular on the inner-city prob-
lems in the United States (Sampson, 2008; Sampson,
Morenoff, & Gannon-Rowley, 2002; Wilson, 1987).
As is often the case in contemporary empirical social sci-
ences, ideas that drive research debates in the United States
are imported and applied by European scholars. Consequently,
we see a growing tendency among European social scientists
to adapt concepts such as neighborhood, ghetto, ethnic
enclave, and the like, to contemporary European societies
(e.g., Edin, Fredriksson, & Åslund, 2003; Grönqvist, 2006;
Kauppinen, 2008; Lapeyronnie, 2008; van der Klaauw & van
Ours, 2003). The fact of segregation poses a serious threat to
the egalitarian ideals of the Scandinavian welfare states.
Sweden is a case of particular importance given its history of
fairly liberal immigration policies.Approximately 16% of the
Swedish population is of foreign origin, and Sweden takes in
the highest number of refugees in Europe. This has led to pro-
nounced residential segregation by ethnic background, espe-
cially in the larger cities. Several studies of the Swedish case
have reported neighborhood and school effects for a variety
of social outcomes--such as school grades, educational
attainment, labor-market standing, and welfare dependency--
although these effects are usually rather small when individ-
ual and family-specific characteristics have been accounted
for, and the effects are generally greater for schools than
for neighborhoods (see, for example, Aberg, Hedström, &
Kolm, 2003; Andersson & Subramanian, 2006; Åslund &
Fredriksson, 2005; Brännström, 2008; Bygren & Szulkin,
2007; Edin et al., 2003; Galster, Andersson, Musterd, &
Kauppinen, 2008; Grönqvist, 2006; Szulkin & Jonsson, 2007).
The crucial issue is the precise mechanisms by which the
social surrounding, and neighborhoods in particular, matter
for social outcomes. Without a clear understanding of the
mechanisms that produce the effect, we will only produce
sociological explanations of rather low explanatory value. A
relatively large number of mechanisms have been proposed,
but the most influential ones in the literature have been social
ties and interaction effects, norms and collective efficacy,
and institutional resources (Sampson et al., 2002). In eco-
nomic research, spatial mismatch may be considered a fourth
mechanism (Edin et al., 2003). Many studies list all or most
of these mechanisms as reasons for the demonstrated, or
expected, association between explanans and explanadum.
However, very few studies actually try to identify these
mechanisms empirically and the "black box" still remains
largely intact (Mayer & Jencks, 1989), and they remain
purely theoretical constructs or assumptions about underly-
ing explanations of observed statistical regularities. Indeed,
a general criticism of this literature is the considerable gap
between theory and analysis (Hedström & Swedberg, 1998),
and it is safe to say that we know very little about the social
mechanisms of neighborhood effects.
Unlike the U.S. literature on neighborhood effects,
Swedish research has singled out network and interaction
effects as the two principal mechanisms. Building on theo-
ries of social capital (Coleman, 1988; Portes, 1998), it has
emphasized factors such as information (e.g., about jobs,
education and future career planning, social allowances),
peer pressure, and role models. In short, in neighborhoods
with scarce resources, people will have less valuable social
capital embedded in their social relations, pressures for con-
formity will be "downward" rather than "upward," and
because of a lack of role models, people will have lower
aspirations. For example, in a recent study that looked spe-
cifically at the role of ethnically segregated neighborhoods,
our colleagues wrote that
The point of departure for the present empirical analy-
sis is . . . that the social interaction between individuals
of the same ethnic background, who live in the same
neighbourhood, is relatively strong and that these rela-
tions influence the school performance, educational
choices, and consequently the future educational career
of children growing up there. Such network mecha-
nisms may self-reinforce norms and behaviors and
have been found to influence, inter alia, the accumula-
tion of human capital, the probability of being unem-
ployed, and the probability of becoming a recipient of
social welfare. (Bygren & Szulkin, 2007, p. 7)
The very same idea, that one can isolate the crucial deter-
minants of an individual's social network by locating at his
or her neighborhood, is similarly expressed in a study of eth-
nic enclaves where it is said that
The enclave represents a network that increases the
opportunities for gainful trade in the labor market . . .
Further, the network disseminates valuable informa-
tion on, e.g., job opportunities . . . The enclave would
thus improve labor market outcomes, in particular for
recent immigrants and for individuals who have diffi-
culty integrating into the labor market. Of course, the
enclave may also provide information on matters that
are not conducive to success in the labor market, such
as welfare eligibility. (Edin et al., 2003, p. 336)
Other studies that draw on the same assumption can eas-
ily be added to these two (e.g., Åslund & Fredriksson, 2005;
Grönqvist, 2006; Szulkin & Jonsson, 2007).
Edling and Rydgren 3
We do not take issue with the claim that social networks
matter in the ways described above. What we do find poten-
tially problematic, however, is the jump from geographical
space to social space, that is, the way in which neighborhood
is used as a proxy for social network. The crux of the matter,
also expressed by Brännström (2008), is that although stud-
ies of neighborhood and school effects in Sweden acknowl-
edge "that it is not self-evident that the observed associations
are rooted in neighborhood/schoolmate interactions, the
results are often interpreted as if such social interactions
have brought about the empirical regularities"2 (p. 465).
As indicated by the quotations above, research on
neighborhood effects in Sweden has increasingly focused
on ethnic segregation. The reasons for this are twofold.
First, ethnic segregation in Sweden is associated with
socioeconomic differences, so that the concentration of
immigrants is higher in neighborhoods that are poor in
terms of social resources. Second, it is assumed that
networks among coethnics are particularly dense, and
therefore it is believed that it is more justifiable to use
neighborhoods as a proxy for social networks in these
cases. For instance, Bygren and Szulkin (2007) stated that
their "analyses are based on the assumption that individuals
with the same ethnic background influence each other to a
greater degree than do individuals with different ethnic
backgrounds" (p. 11). And they "assume that a joint ethnic
background raises the interaction probability and frequency
between the individuals and that persons with the
same background represent `significant others' in a social
environment" (Bygren & Szulkin, 2007, p. 11).
The theoretical underpinnings of these assumptions are
the general tendency toward social homophily--that is, a
preference for social interactions with people who are simi-
lar to oneself--and increased contact opportunities. It is
well established that people mainly tend to become friends
with people who are socially similar to themselves
(McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001). Yet despite this
fact, there are several reasons to be critical of the assump-
tions underlying research on "ethnic enclaves" and "ethnic
neighborhoods" in a Swedish context. According to a com-
monly used definition (Åslund & Fredriksson, 2005; Edin et
al., 2003; Grönqvist, 2006), "an ethnic neighborhood [is] a
neighborhood where the share of the ethnic group residing
in the neighborhood is at least twice as large as the share of
the ethnic group in the population" (Åslund & Fredriksson,
2005, p. 6). Swedish research on ethnic neighborhoods or
ethnic enclaves is highly influenced by studies on highly
segregated ethnic neighborhoods in the United States, such
as Chinese in New York (Zhou, 1992), Cubans in Miami
(Portes, 1987), or Koreans in Los Angeles (Light &
Bonacich, 1988). These neighborhoods are fairly well
delimitated geographically, and they have a number of char-
acteristics that are usually missing in segregated areas in
Sweden. First, they are dominated by one ethnic group. This
is very seldom the case in Sweden, where segregated areas
are usually populated by immigrants coming from a large
numbers of countries. Hence, most segregated areas in
Sweden are ethnically very heterogeneous despite the fact
that relatively few native Swedes live there (see Brännström,
2008). According to the definition of ethnic neighborhoods
provided above, a neighborhood with 2% Iranians, for
example, would be called an Iranian neighborhood, if
Iranians' percentage of the population in Sweden is only
1%. This is quite different from Chinatown in New York
City. Second, and related, is that in the American ethnic
enclaves mentioned above, people can manage their lives
pretty well by using only the minority language. And a com-
mon minority language goes a long way toward creating
social relations. However, because ethnic neighborhoods in
Sweden are so heterogeneous, a common language (other
than Swedish) is usually lacking. Because of this, we find it
problematic to import sociological studies from the United
States to the Nordic countries, without first modifying the
assumptions.
A Critical Assessment of
Assumptions in Previous Research
It is generally assumed in research on neighborhood effects
that neighborhood can serve as a proxy for social networks
and consequently that we can draw conclusions about net-
work effects from the neighborhood indicator itself. We may
call this a jump from geographical space to social space. Is
this reasonable? First, as implied in some of the reviewed
Swedish studies, there are theoretical reasons for making
these assumptions (Aberg et al., 2003). "Foci of activity"
play a significant role in the emergence of network ties.
Such foci are important as they bring people together in
recurrent interaction, thereby organizing their social rela-
tions (Feld, 1981). Neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, and
civil society organizations (e.g., churches, sport clubs) are
examples of such foci. The more these foci overlap (e.g., if
your neighbors are also your schoolmates and football team-
mates), the greater the chance that social interactions will
develop into friendship relations. From a theoretical vantage
point, it is reasonable to assume that the extent to which foci
of activity are locally bounded, and thus overlap more with
neighborhood (and one another), varies with age, which
means that children's circles of friends tend to be more con-
centrated in geographical space than are those of adults.
Hence, if a jump from social space to geographical space is
reasonable at all, it should in particular be the case for chil-
dren and adolescents who are still in school. This assump-
tion is supported by a Swedish study that analyzed diaries of
130 children aged between the ages of 11 and 14 (van der
Burgt, 2006). A majority of these children (more than 60%)
had friends residing in their own neighborhoods. Yet the data
clearly indicate that geographical proximity decreases in
importance the older the children become: For the youngest
children (in fifth grade), 46% had no friends living outside
of their neighborhood; for the older children (in the seventh
grade) the corresponding figure was only 30%.

Yet in general terms, to use neighborhood as a proxy for
social interaction is a rather strong assumption. The assump-
tion that people residing in Neighborhood A interact more
with one another than with people in Neighborhood B is
intuitively very plausible. However, the assumption that they
interact more with one another than with people in
Neighborhoods B to Z is considerably less plausible. As the
number of people residing outside of one's neighborhood--
even slightly outside--is so much larger than the number of
people residing within one's neighborhood, this assumption
is not as self-evident as it is often presented to be. Statistically,
there are simply more people outside their neighborhood.
And technologically, it is becoming increasingly easy, and
common, to maintain close social interactions with people
who live far away.
In his discussion of the focused interaction of social life,
Feld provided a similar account of why we should hesitate to
accept even the theoretical idea that neighborhood can be an
approximation of social networks. People who share a focus
are likely to share activities as well, according to Feld (1981),
However, all individuals who share a focus do not
necessarily interact with each other very much or very
often. For foci where everyone is forced to interact
much and often (e.g., families), all of the individuals
associated with that focus will be tied to each other;
but for foci that are less constraining on interaction
(e.g., city neighborhoods), only a slightly higher pro-
portion of individuals will be tied than would be tied
in the general population. In general, the more con-
straining a focus, the greater is the likelihood that two
individuals associated with that focus will be tied. A
focus may involve very little constraint, but where
there is no constraint at all, there is no focus.. . . In
general, larger foci will be less constraining, because
it is difficult to arrange for many people to have fre-
quent joint activities. However, there may be small
foci that involve little constraint and large ones that
involve much. (p. 1019)
Furthermore, there is a considerable risk of ecological fal-
lacy in using neighborhoods as a proxy for social networks.
The size of this risk depends partly on how neighborhoods
are operationalized. Small Area Market Statistics (SAMS)
areas are used in the more sophisticated Swedish studies.
SAMS, provided by Statistics Sweden, are designed to iden-
tify relatively well-delineated socially and spatially homoge-
neous neighborhoods, and they take account of factors such
as housing type and tenure. The SAMS areas are relatively
small in size, varying between 100 and 4,000 individuals,
with an average of 970 inhabitants (Aberg et al., 2003;
Andersson & Subramanian, 2006; Brännström, 2008; Bygren
& Szulkin, 2007). Municipalities, that is, large entities with
a median of 16,000 inhabitants (Åslund & Fredriksson,
2005; Edin et al., 2003), tend to be used in less sophisticated
studies of neighborhood effects. It is our strong contention
that only SAMS areas can be assumed to measure neighbor-
hoods in any reasonable sense of the term.
Below we will present empirical data collected from ninth
graders in three Stockholm schools that clearly question the
tenability of the jump from geographic space to social space
that is common in Swedish research on neighborhood effects
and school effects.
Data
We conducted a survey, "Your life and your future," from
November 2007 through January 2008 by distributing a
questionnaire in 13 classes of ninth graders in 3 schools
from distinctively different areas in the greater Stockholm
area. We selected schools from a list of 15 schools that (a)
had a majority of their pupils living in the local area of the
school (which is the case for the overwhelming majority of
comprehensive schools in Sweden) and (b) were located in
one of three types of areas. These areas had to have either
predominantly non-Swedish ethnic homogeneity, predomi-
nantly Swedish ethnic homogeneity, or a heterogeneous
ethnic composition. Schools were contacted in no particular
order, and the first school from each category that agreed to
participate was selected. Schools included in the sample are
located in the three areas Alby, Brandbergen, and Sofia.
Some comparative statistics for these areas are provided in
Table 1, and some key characteristics are further discussed
below. Despite the fact that the sampling procedure was
nonrandom, we are fairly confident that the schools we
selected are representative, and that the results and conclu-
sions can be generalized to the Stockholm area and beyond.
Alby is part of Botkyrka municipality in south-west met-
ropolitan Stockholm. Alby has about 12,000 inhabitants and
is a product of the early 1970s when modern Alby was built
and most of the apartment blocks that still house most of its
inhabitants were erected. About 77% of the population is of
foreign origin, and in 2007, the unemployment rate was just
below 5%. Alby has excellent infrastructure; it is close to the
major highway and has a subway connection to the city.
Brandbergen is part of Haninge municipality in south
metropolitan Stockholm. Brandbergen has about the same
population as Alby and is also a product of the early 1970s
with large apartment blocks. Brandbergen was given a major
overhaul in the early 1990s to come to grips with its social
problems. About 43% of the population of Brandbergen is of
foreign origin, and about 3.4% were unemployed in late
2007. Brandbergen is geographically a little more isolated
than Alby, with bus connections to the commuter rail net-
work. Both Alby and Brandbergen border extensive recre-
ational areas and nature reserves.
Sofia is part of Södermalm in central Stockholm and has
a little less than 8,000 inhabitants. About 14% of the popula-
tion in Sofia is of foreign origin, and unemployment was
about 1,9% in 2007. As is suggested in Table 1, Alby and
Brandbergen are working-class areas whereas Sofia is an
affluent middle-class area.3
Edling and Rydgren 5
The questionnaires were filled out during class hours with
a research assistant present. A total of 241 pupils participated
across these 13 classes. As outside observers, we had no con-
trol over class absenteeism, and we did not offer any reward
for participating. Overall response rate across classrooms
was approximately 80%. Boys in Brandbergen and Alby
where less willing to participate than girls, which means that
boys are underrepresented in the sample. As it turned out,
apart from one example, internal nonresponse was not a
problem, with only one of the distributed questionnaires
handed in with most items blank.
The demographics of the samples in the three schools, dis-
played in Table 2, mirror the skew distribution of people of
foreign origin that we find in the three areas, with 33% of the
students in Sofia being of foreign background compared with
41% in Brandbergen, and 98% in Alby. Parents' country of
birth was used to code foreign origin as a binary variable.4
Because of the small sample size, we are not able to analyze
distinct countries or regions. However, the most common
regions of origin among those with a non-Swedish background
were the Middle East, followed by South America and Latin
America, and the three most common countries were Turkey,
Chile, and Iraq. But it is important to keep in mind that we
analyzed the second generation and that the majority of the
ninth graders in our sample were born in Sweden, ranging
from 87% in Alby to 97% in Sofia. We had more girls than
boys in the sample in both Alby and Brandbergen. We could
not control class absenteeism at the data gathering sessions,
and girls were simply more willing than boys to participate.
Results
The key question that we asked was whether it is reasonable
to use the concept of neighborhood as a proxy for social
interaction space. It remains an open question whether the
theoretical ideas encapsulated in concepts such as neighbor-
hood, enclave, and ghetto translate at all to Scandinavian
reality. However, there is one even greater problem and that
is the assumption that neighborhood is also a reasonable
proxy for social interaction. That is to say, that people tend
to have their socially significant relationships embedded
within a well-defined and fairly limited geographic space. In
essence, this is a sort of mean field solution that reduces the
multidimensionality of social interaction to the bidimension-
ality of geographical space. If it works, it is an extremely
efficient solution. But it is very bold and runs the risk of
leading researchers to an ecological fallacy. Thus, the issue
needs to be further explored.
The individuals in our data were 15 or 16 years old and
were still in school. Theoretically, the likelihood that their
circles of friends were locally bounded should be higher than
for older persons out of school. Our empirical test of neigh-
borhoods as a proxy for social networks was thus rather

conservative, as many of the studies we have cited deal with
older individuals.
To measure people's circle of friends, we asked our
respondents to think of, at most, five friends with whom they
most often spend time.5 We further asked the respondents to
indicate for each friend his or her sex, age (similar age/
younger/older), ethnic background (Swedish/immigrant),
family relation (family/nonfamily),6 whether or not they are
in the same class, and whether or not they live in the same
neighborhood.7 Thus, the critical indicator for the present
analysis is the number of friends who lived in the same
neighborhood. But some of the other aspects of friendship
composition will also be part of the analysis. It is potentially
problematic to use subjective measures for this research
question,8 and we cannot know for sure how the respondents
understood the term in the same neighborhood. However, in
an earlier study by Andersson (2001), a sample of people
delimited almost SAMS-identical areas on maps when asked
about "their neighborhoods," which indicates that the sub-
jective understanding of neighborhoods corresponds well
with some of the more objective classifications.
Almost every respondent (n = 225) produced information
on the maximum number of five friends and their character-
istics. In the subsequent analyses of friendship composition,
we analyze only those who reported five friends. We calcu-
late for each respondent the number of friends of the same
sex and the same ethnic background who were in the same
class and lived in the same neighborhood. The indicator on
same ethnic background is constructed from the distinction
between Swedish and non-Swedish.9 The internal nonre-
sponse for these particular indicators ranged from 7% (same
class) to 14% (same background). Each indicator has a
straightforward interpretation and takes on a value from 0 to
5, where 5 indicates that all friends are of the same sex, for
example.
We use "friendship" and "friendship circle" interchange-
ably when describing the social interaction space of ninth
graders. We refrain from talking about networks because we
do not have information on network volume or density, nor
on the quality of friendship ties. However, we are confident
that the indicators tell us a great deal about the composition
of the friendships that define the core of the social interac-
tion space of teenagers.
We go directly to the heart of the matter and display, in
Figure 1, the fraction of ninth graders who reported that a
majority of their friends live in the same neighborhood as
they do. The darker shaded piece of each pie indicates that a
majority of friends (i.e., 3) lived in the same neighborhood
as the respondent. In Alby, 64% of the ninth graders had a
majority of their friends in their own neighborhood, which
suggests that social interaction is indeed geographically
local. However, for Sofia, the corresponding figure is 44%,
and in Brandbergen, only 35% of the ninth graders said that
a majority of their friends live in the same neighborhood.
This means that in two of the three schools that we surveyed,
a majority of teenagers had only a minority of their friends in
their own neighborhood. This strongly suggests that the
friendship circles of ninth graders are not confined to their
immediate neighborhood.
It seems fair to conclude that without further qualifica-
tions, neighborhood is not a reasonable proxy for social
interaction space. Overall, we find that a large fraction of the
Figure 1. Percentage of ninth graders with a majority of friends in the neighborhood across three Stockholm schools
Edling and Rydgren 7
ninth graders we surveyed had a considerable number of
friends living in another neighborhood than their own. And
even among those ninth graders who had the most confined
friendship circles, at least 35% had two thirds of their friends
in another neighborhood.
We note a substantial and statistically significant differ-
ence between schools with respect to whether ninth graders
have friendships within their own neighborhood. With
respect to our indicators, schoolchildren in Brandbergen
seem to have more diverse friendship circles than schoolchil-
dren in Alby, with Sofia somewhere in between but closer to
Brandbergen. Let us further investigate this result by adding
information on whether the ninth graders tended to have
friends of the same sex and of the same ethnic background
who were in the same school class.
In Figure 2, we display for each school the number of
friends, from 0 to 5, who share the respondent's characteris-
tics. Moving clockwise from the upper left corner, we give
number of friends of same sex, number of friends of same
ethnic background, number of friends living in the same
neighborhood, and number of friends in same school class.
We note that with respect to sex, there is a strong tendency in
all schools for same-sex friendship circles. It is indeed rare
(about 7%) for a ninth grader of either sex to have a majority
of opposite-sex friends.
There is a tendency across all three schools for a majority
of the friends of a ninth grader to be of the same ethnic back-
ground (note that this is a crude indicator that only distin-
guishes between Swedish and non-Swedish backgrounds).
However, this tendency is especially pronounced among the
ninth graders in Alby, where as many as 70% said that all of
their friends were of the same ethnic background as they,
compared with about 38% in the other two schools. For ninth
graders in Alby, sharing the same ethnic background means
almost without exception that both they and their friends are
of non-Swedish origin. The ninth graders in Sofia seem to
have had the most diverse friendship circles with respect to
ethnic background. But despite the fact that 8% said that all
of their friends were of another ethnic background, as many
as 75% said that a majority (60%) of their friends were of
the same ethnic background as them. The comparative fig-
ures for Brandbergen are 1% and 80%, respectively.
Let us now approach the key question of whether friend-
ship is spatially structured, but this time focusing on the
school. Admittedly, school is much more than a spatial qual-
ity, organizing as it does a significant part of most teenagers'

daily life. Nevertheless, schools are also spatially bound,
attracting students primarily from the local neighborhoods.
This is why we are interested in the number of friends who
are in the same class at school (lower left graph in Figure 2).
At first, there seems to be no clear tendency in these three
distributions. The number of friends in the same class is
rather nicely distributed in all three schools around a mode
of two to three friends. Thus, while most ninth graders have
a balanced mix in and out of class, some tend to have a
majority of their friends in their own class, whereas others
tend to have only a minority of their friends in the same
school class.
However, it is worth paying attention to the tail ends of
the distribution of number of friends in the same class. In the
Alby school, 3% said that none of their friends were in
the same class, and 12% said that all of their friends were in
the same class. Compare this with the Sofia school, where
not a single teenager had all of his or her friends in same
class, and 16% said that none of their friends were in their
class.10 This is a striking difference, which indicates that
friendship among ninth graders in Alby was much more
determined by the classroom than it was among schoolchil-
dren in the other two schools. The lower right graph in Figure
2 gives the distribution of friends living in the same neigh-
borhood. We learned from Figure 1 that it is premature to
assume neighborhood to be an indicator of social interaction
space. We provide this graph to allow for a direct comparison
with the other friendship composition statistics.
The evidence we have presented clearly suggests that
Alby could be a strong case of the type of neighborhood that
is intuitively suggested in the literature on neighborhood
effects. The vast majority of ninth graders in Alby were of
non-Swedish background, they tended to make friends with
others who were non-Swedish, their friends also tended to be
classmates to a greater extent than in the other schools, and a
majority of their friends tended to be in the same neighbor-
hood. Yet, we would strongly dispute that Alby is an ethnic
enclave. Unfortunately, our crude binary measure of ethnic
background does not allow us to address this question
directly. However, we did ask the respondents which lan-
guage they speak with their friends.
As shown in Table 3, the vast majority, 90%, spoke
Swedish with their friends. Among the 125 persons of non-
Swedish origin in the sample, only 16% said that they regu-
larly spoke a language other than Swedish with their friends.
The rest, 84%, said they spoke Swedish with their friends.
Alby is no different in this respect. Despite the fact that 98%
of our ninth graders in Alby were of foreign origin, more
than 80% said that they spoke Swedish with their friends,
reflecting the fact that segregated areas in Stockholm (and in
Sweden and Scandinavia) are ethnically highly heteroge-
neous and that for the young, the natural choice of language
becomes that of the "new" country.
Yet, we do see an "Alby-effect" on spatially bounded
friendship, and this effect is further established in Table 4,
where we regress the number of friends in the neighborhood
on the respondent's sex, ethnic background, and school. We
note statistically significant effects of sex and Alby school
on the number of friends living in the same neighborhood.
Girls had a tendency to have more friends who did not live in
the same neighborhood compared with boys. The "Alby-
effect" is also substantial, with ninth graders in Alby tending
to have more friends in the neighborhood than ninth graders
in both Brandbergen and Sofia.11
Based on Figure 2, we feel confident that friendship
among Stockholm ninth graders in the early 2000s was
highly homogeneous with respect to sex and ethnicity, just as
one would expect. Without pursuing this at greater length, it
is interesting to note that the ninth graders who said that a
majority of their friends were of another ethnic background
were themselves mainly of non-Swedish origin. This goes
without saying in Alby, where almost everyone in our survey
was of non-Swedish background by our definition. But this
was true in the other two schools as well. Among the ninth
graders in Brandbergen who said that a majority of their
friends were of a different ethnic background, 11 out of 14
were of non-Swedish background. The same went for Sofia,
where 17 out of 21 of the ninth graders with a majority of
friends from another ethnic background were themselves
"non-Swedes." This would be a worthwhile object of future
study, as it suggests that the "immigrant kids" could play an
important brokering role between Swedes and non-Swedes
in Swedish society.

Discussion
Research on the United States has convincingly demon-
strated the importance of neighborhood effects on the life
chances of the individual. And some studies aiming at repli-
cating these results for Scandinavia have also established
small but significant effects of neighborhood for various
outcomes. Such effects have been interpreted in terms of
network effects, meaning that the driving force between these
correlations is micro-level social interaction patterns. Of
course, all empirical regularities should be stated in terms of
their generating mechanisms (Hedström, 2005), and this line
of research is to be applauded for taking explanatory theory
serious. However, the micro mechanisms have never been
empirically established. And despite the fact that they rest on
some fairly strong assumptions about the structure of social
interaction, researchers have sometimes provided very lax
theoretical support. Because this is highly policy-relevant
research, we argue that it is of the utmost importance to fur-
ther investigate the critical assumption that neighborhood
effects can be interpreted in terms of network effects.
Researchers focusing on Sweden have a unique opportu-
nity to use register data to study a large variety of social out-
comes. These data are fantastic in many ways, in particular
for individual-level analysis, and they usually avoid many of
the problems associated with survey data (such as low
response rates). Yet the availability of good data does not
mean that it should be used for everything. We lack register
data for social relations, networks, and interaction patterns,
and it is tempting for researchers to use shortcut strategies by
using neighborhoods, for which data are available from regis-
ters, as a proxy (e.g., Bygren & Szulkin, 2007).
No large-scale data are yet available for social interaction
and individual attitudes at the individual level. However, we
have taken a first step in looking closer at one critical
assumption about micro-level interaction. And we have
demonstrated that the reliance on ecological data is an erro-
neous strategy. It is untenable to use neighborhoods as a
proxy for networks. In our study of three schools, only Alby
provided some support for the notion that neighborhood cap-
tures social interaction at least to some degree. The other two
did not. Hence, although there are strong theoretical reasons
to assume that network and interaction effects are important
factors for understanding social outcomes--such as school
grades, educational attainment, labor-market standing, and
welfare dependency--the only way to study these effects is
to collect network data. We also see it as potentially useful to
combine quantitative research with ethnographic studies
(e.g., Lapeyronnie, 2008) to better understand important dif-
ferences between neighborhoods (e.g., between Alby and
Brandbergen).
However, that neighborhood is generally a poor proxy
for social networks and interactions does not diminish the
fact that neighborhoods might be an important factor for
explaining various social outcomes in its own respect.
Institutional resources and spatial mismatch are two
potentially important factors, and these mechanisms would
come more to the fore in studies of neighborhood effects if
network effects could be accounted for directly. We agree
with Brännström (2004) that "the black box of neighbor-
hood effects still needs to be further investigated [if] we
want to achieve a better link between the theoretical and the
empirical levels" (p. 2534).

Notes
1. Hence, the purpose of this study is neither to disprove the
existence of neighborhood effects nor to test social network
effects; it is much more restricted (but no less important) to
critically scrutinize the assumption that neighborhoods can be
used as a proxy for social interaction or even social networks.
2. Hence, most studies are not as explicit as Grönqvist's study
of Helsinki (2006) in stating that "this paper does not answer
the question why enclaves affect educational attainments, but
merely that it does" (p. 370).
3. For comparison, note that about 17% of the Swedish popu-
lation is of foreign background and about 2.5% were unem-
ployed in 2007. The corresponding figures for Stockholm
County are 23.5% and 2.1%.
 4. "Swedish" if both parents were born in Sweden or the Nordic
countries; see also Footnote 10.
 5. The phrasing of the question (in Swedish) was "Think about
a friend or friends that you most often meet and spend time
together with. Think of at most five friends."
 6. We used the Swedish word for extended family, which is "släkt."
 7. "Live (does not live) in the same neighborhood."
 8. Most of the studies cited in this article rely on data from offi-
cial population registers.
9. Ninth graders both of whose parents were born in Sweden,
or one of whose parents was born in Sweden and the other in
one of the Nordic country, and who speaks only Swedish at
home are coded as "Swedish." All others are coded as "non-
Swedish." Thus, if the respondent is "Swedish" and the friend
is reported as having a "Swedish background," this friend is
coded as having the same ethnic background.

10. The Brandbergen school was somewhere in between, but
closer to Sofia. Three percent had all of their friends in the
same class, and 16% said that none of their five friends were
in their class.
11. Because the dependent variable is a count variable, we
report results from a Poisson regression. Similar results were
obtained with negative binomial models and ordinary least
squares (OLS) models. Analyses were run in STATA 9.
