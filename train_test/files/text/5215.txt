Introduction
International tourists grew by 4.4% to a total 980 million in
2011, in spite of many challenges, political changes, and
disasters in the Middle East, North Africa, and Japan.
Hospitality is responsible for 5% of the global Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) and 6% of the total exports, as well
as employing 1 out of 12 workers in the economy around the
world (United Nations World Tourism Organization
[UNWTO], 2012). Safety and security are very important in
the hospitality industry. UNWTO (2012) argued that the
growth by region was 10% in South America and 6% in
Europe, which is explained by the stable economy in Europe
and the relapse in North Africa and the Middle East. The pur-
pose of this study is to explore the existing literature about
emergency preparedness for disasters and crisis affecting the
hotel industry, and how we can mitigate the effects of such
hazards. This will shed the light to plan for the next hazard-
ous events.
In this regard, many researchers argued that safety and
security are most important to tourist while traveling and the
first aspect they consider (Pizam, Tarlow, & Bloom, 1997;
Rittichainuwat, 2005; Sönmez, & Graefe; 1998). Enz (2009)
mentioned that being protected from hazards is the most
important issue for the tourists as hotel customers. Crimes
against hotels and its guests will happen when there is any
opportunity or gap in the hotel (Lisante, 1972). Hospitality
cannot develop in destinations with hazards (Reisinger &
Mavondo, 2005). Countries with crime notoriety will strug-
gle to retain their tourists (Prideaux, 1996).
The history and progression of emergency management is
very important to understand (Haddow & Bullock, 2006).
Emergency management has existed since ancient times as
has been shown by the ancient hieroglyphics demonstrating
how the old cave-man dealt with disasters, and later how the
next generations tried to cope with disasters preparing for
them before they occurred.
The emergency management definition could be diversi-
fied regarding event response, style of management, and
willingness from stakeholders. Haddow and Bullock (2006)
defined emergency management as dealing with hazards
timely and taking action to avoid hazards. Practitioners men-
tioned safety measures like closed circuit TV (CCTV),

Emergency Preparedness for Disasters
and Crises in the Hotel Industry
Ahmad Rasmi AlBattat1 and Ahmad Puad Mat Som1
Abstract
Safety and security are the most important issues to tourist while traveling and the first aspect they consider is to be protected
from hazards. Emergency planning and preparedness for a crisis are the most significant components of dealing with disasters.
Hospitality practitioners noticed a rising number of natural and man-made crises that harm the hospitality industry, regarding
its vulnerability to crisis and internal and external hazards. By using secondary data, this study aims to shed some light on
this issue, contributing to knowledge and awareness on emergency preparedness for the hospitality industry. Moreover, the
study aims to explain the management's commitment to adopt, develop, and update emergency plans. The results of this
study explain that tourism as an international mobile industry must respond to internal and external hazards such as disease
movement and terrorist attacks. Marketing safety is important to promote hotels and tourist destinations to the guests and
holiday advisors. Hotels have a long history of being a soft target for terrorist attacks, as can be seen in several accidents that
have shaken the hotel industry in the past few decades. Hotels invest a lot to install protective techniques, but terrorists are
becoming more organized. Practitioners propose disaster management frameworks using several measurements. Recovery
from crisis and learning help business retention that minimizes negative impacts and prevent losses. Finally, evaluation and
feedback are very important to overcome the hazards and return to normal, as well as adopting new ideas to deal with
emergencies. Single- and double-loop organizational learning should benefit proactive preparedness.

passport photo ID checks, guards, emergency generators, fire

Pizam, 1996; Bullen, 1988; Enz, 2009; Kwortnik, 2005).
Researchers such as Lois, Wang, Wall, and Ruxton (2004)
clarified the guests need for a printed multilingual emer-
gency form providing guidance and evacuation procedures.
Planning is the most significant component to dealing with a
crisis (Cavanaugh, 2006).
Coyne (2011) asserted that disasters could create shaki-
ness and menace the security and safety of any community.
Natural or human-made unexpected phenomena, disasters
can take place in any region (Haddow & Bullock, 2006).
Faulkner (2001) noticed a rising number of natural and man-
made crises that harm the hospitality industry. Scholars
noticed a series of crises and disasters such as 9/11 (Prideaux,
2004), the Bird Flu outbreak in 2001 (Sperling & Biermann,
2009), foot and mouth epidemic (Sharpley & Craven, 2001),
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002-2003
in Southern China and Hong Kong (S. Kim, Chun, & Lee,
2005), the 2003 Blackout (Kwortnik, 2005), the Iraqi War in
2003 (Copson, 2003), the Tsunami in 2004 (Chandrasekharan
et al., 2008), Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Trotter & Fernandez,
2009), London bombing in 2005 (Lockey et al., 2005), Bali
bombing in 2005 (Hitchcock & Darma Putra, 2005), the
H1N1 (Sperling & Biermann, 2009), the Amman bombing in
2005 (Weimann, 2006), the financial crisis (Hall, 2010), and
the Arab spring revolution in 2010 (Cordesman, 2011). Such
events can cause insecurity and future uncertainty (Malhotra
& Venkatesh, 2009). Moreover, they can directly impact the
number of tourist (Mendoza, Brida, & Garrido, 2012).
The hospitality industry is one of the most vulnerable to
crisis and can be affected by internal and external hazards
(Henderson & Ng, 2004; Santana, 2004). Some practitioners
study the impact of the crisis on different sectors within the
hospitality industry such as restaurants (Green, Bartholomew,
& Murrmann, 2004; Tse, So, & Sin, 2006), airlines (Gillen &
Lall, 2003; Henderson, 2003), travel agents (Lovelock,
2003), and hotels (Chien & Law, 2003; Hassanain, 2009;
Israeli & Reichel, 2003; S. Kim et al., 2005). The effects of
disasters cannot be stopped, but they can be mitigated, and
lives and property can be saved (Ritchie, 2004).
Literature Review
Emergency Management Preparedness
Fink (1986) clarified that efficient planning has a sufficient
role in emergency management. He asserted that planning for
emergencies is very important to control the existing event. In
addition, it is a technique to avoid hazards such as hotel fires,
and demonstrates the intention to recognize the crisis warning
signals. Hotels have been categorized as high-risk buildings,
especially for fires, because of the presence of highly flam-
mable materials and the chance of pervasion of smoke and
fire to the rest of the building or even to neighboring
buildings (Hassanain, 2009). Subramaniam (2004) spoke
about improving knowledge that allows the practitioners to
understand hotel fire characteristics, while Ellis (1981) clari-
fied the employees'need to receive sufficient training on how
to deal with fires and miscellaneous hazards.
Furness and Muckett (2007) indicated that the concentra-
tion of guests in a specific area could slow the escaping
capacity near exits, which could increase the injuries in case
of emergencies. And it is important to note the amount of
flammable materials that could turn into suitable fuel for a
fire (Goodson & Murnane, 2008). Furthermore, the hotel
design of placing the guest rooms in the highest floors, while
the high-risk facilities are placed in the lower floors, is a
risky plan that may close the escape exits in case of emergen-
cies (Roberts & Chan, 2000).
Information technology (IT) has recently been involved
with all hotel operations: front office, reservation, restau-
rants, accounting, housekeeping, and wireless networks in
the guest rooms and public areas in the hotel (Choice, 2000;
Cobanoglu & Cougias, 2003; Collins & Cobanoglu, 2008).
Zhang and Paxson (2000) asserted that IT could open a back
door for threats to customers by using unauthorized access to
the hotel and guests' data, which demonstrates the necessity
of an efficient computer security system. A hotel may secure
its information and protect it from prohibited usage (H. Kim,
Lee, & Ham, 2012). This insures the software and hardware
security works continuously without information interrup-
tion (Azaiez & Bier, 2007; Zio, 2009), and protects the
guests' personal data (O'Connor, 2007).
Furthermore, the potential usage of biometric technolo-
gies in the hospitality industry could reinforce the hotel ser-
vices by ensuring security, maintain customer relations by
reducing the cost, and improve the effectiveness of hotel
security operations. Moreover, biometric technologies could
be used for physical access, computers passwords, and rec-
ognition of terrorists and criminals (Meyers & Mills, 2005).
Hotels may have to cooperate with the intelligence and police
agencies to prevent crimes and terrorist activities (Bach &
Pizam, 1996; Chin, 2003). Biometric systems could decrease
robbery by guests and employees as well as the misuse of
hotel assets (Tinari, 2003).
Tourism, as an international mobile industry, has a great
role in the disease movement (Barker et al., 2006; Budd, Bell,
& Brown, 2009; Hall, 2010; Hulme, 2009; Mouchtouri et al.,
2008; Tatem, 2009), as it is possible to transfer the pestilential
from one tourist destination to another (Sharpley & Craven,
2001; Stanbury, Pryer, & Roberts, 2005). For example, in a
few weeks SARS prevailed in more than 30 countries, caus-
ing the death of approximately 900 people, and more than
8,400 were infected by the disease (Lee & McKibbin, 2004).
Terrorism also has a great impact on hospitality and the
tourism industry. Great changes are occurring in the world
vision toward safety and security, with a high effect on the
global economy and flight cancellations, which cause a low
occupancy rate and decrease in the arrivals (Chan & Lam,
AlBattat and Mat Som 3
2013). Goodrich (2002) stated that U.S. hotel occupancy
dropped by half with at least US$2 billion losses after
September 11. Further safety and security awareness should
give the guests a clearer idea about flexibility actions taken in
case of emergency. This means that the higher the safety plan,
the higher safety improvement by the hotel. Furthermore,
hotels may market their safety to increase awareness and pro-
mote their hotels as well the destinations to the guests and
holiday advisors (Graham & Roberts, 2000).
Planning for emergencies should consider several internal
factors such as collaboration, communication, and control.
But the most important internal factor is the management's
commitment to adopt and develop an emergency manage-
ment plan, which will be a strong guidance and updated mes-
sage to communicate before, during, and after the crisis
(Faulkner, 2001). Caponigro (2000) argued that large organi-
zations are more likely to have an emergency plan than
smaller ones, depending on the size and their financial situa-
tion. Furthermore, Caponigro clarified that with limited
resources, crisis planning is less important for small organi-
zations, as they think that crisis will not affect them, or they
will manage their business without a plan. Some practitio-
ners explained that the organizations that faced a disaster
before will be more likely to invest in and develop their own
emergency plan, because they suffer from the previous haz-
ards and learn from its effect on the properties and human
lives (Guth, 1995; Pearson & Mitroff, 1993).
Stakeholders and managers should be aware of the impor-
tance of updating an emergency plan and full detailed infor-
mation about their hotels, its services, and safety and security
procedures adopted in the case of vulnerability. Della-
Giustina (2003) explained three steps essential in emergency
planning: to recognize existing risks, to develop an updated
emergency plan, and finally to assure the organization's pre-
paredness for the emergencies. The plan also should contain
the use, maintenance, and upgrading for the security and
safety systems (Enz, 2003).
Many studies have examined how the tourist destination's
image, safety, and security affect the tourist destination
choice, as tourists search for a safe place away from natural
and man-made disasters (Carter, 1998; Floyd, Gibson,
Pennington-Gray, & Thapa, 2004; Kozak, Crotts, & Law,
2007; Law, 2006; Lepp & Gibson, 2008; Pizam et al., 1997;
Reisinger & Mavondo, 2005; Rittichainuwat, 2006; Sönmez
& Graefe, 1998; Thapa, Holland, & Absher, 2008). But
unfortunately, a very few studies were undertaken to exam-
ine the planning and preparedness for the emergency man-
agement issues in the hospitality industry (Ritchie, 2008).
So, this article will explain how hospitality industry can be
prepared for the next hazards and lessons to mitigate the
effect of such hazardous events on the hotels.
Hotel Safety and Security
Terrorist activities can cause a negative impact on the hotel
sector and decrease the number of arrivals in a destination
(Stafford, Yu, & Armoo, 2006). Hotels have a long history of
being soft targets for terrorist attacks, with terrorists using
themselves or a bombed car to attack these hotels (Singh
et al., 2004) because they have weaker security measures
compared with governmental or military facilities.
Furthermore, hotels are targets for their brand names, loca-
tion, and the media coverage produced by attacking them
(Stipanuck, American Hotel, & Lodging Educational
Institute, 2006). During the last decade, several accidents
have shaken the hotel industry, for instance, the bombing of
a car at the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta in 2003 killed 13 people
and wounded 100 people. In Amman in 2005, the worse ter-
rorist attack on the Jordanian hotel industry took place when
terrorists bombed three hotels classified as five and four stars
hotels--the Radisson SAS, Hayat Amman, and Days Inn
hotels--killing 67 people and injuring more than 150 people
(Weimann, 2006). With a question of attacking the hotels
regardless of its location, ownership, and nationality, this
emphasizes that hotels should upgrade their security proce-
dures to make them harder targets against terrorist activities
(Pizam, 2010).
Safety and security are essential for the hotels in prevent-
ing death and injury for guests and employees, with multiple
forms of hazards such as falls, cuts, slips, burns, and related
accidents (Enz & Taylor, 2002). To improve safety and secu-
rity, hotels installed CCTV, fire sprinklers, smoke detectors,
and electronic doors (Pizam, 2010). Security personnel have
the responsibility to insure the safety of the hotel, guests,
employees, and assets. In this regard, human resources
should attract and recruit professional security officers with
good experience for this mission. Employees in general, and
security officers specifically, should attend training work-
shops on governmental regulations and first-aid. Moreover,
they should receive fire and emergency evacuation training
to deal effectively with hazards (Henderson, Shufen, Huifen,
& Xiang, 2010). Since September 11, security budgets have
been increased by the hotels to invest more in the front area,
installing heavy-duty equipment (Howie, 2005). To tackle
blackout situations, hotels enhance power systems and emer-
gency lighting (Kwortnik, 2005).
Academic practitioners began to fathom the safety and
security research in the hospitality and tourism industry in
the 1990s.Abraham Pizam (1999) categorized the features of
criminals by studying 300 cases at worldwide tourism desti-
nations. He analyses the effectiveness of tourism models
from different aspects, especially tourism demand, and iden-
tifies the duties for different parties in the stage of prevention
and recovery. Other hospitality practitioners investigate the
role of safety and security managers in the hospitality indus-
try. Gill, Moon, Seaman, and Turbin (2002) studied this role
in the U.K. hotels, where they found that security managers
have a conventional responsibility guarding the hotels in dif-
ferent aspects including safety, health, IT security, fire safety,
insurance, and loss prevention. In contrast, Pizam (2010)
argued that hotels still did not upgrade their security levels.
His study found that 30% of U.S. hotel general managers did
4 SAGE Open
not upgrade their security systems. Some managers argued
that they were satisfied with the system efficiency (Enz,
2003). Other managers did not do any upgrading to their sys-
tems because they were convinced that the crisis would not
happen to them. Furthermore, this improvement will not
generate extra revenue for them (Shellum, 2003).
This study proposes a theoretical framework (Figure 1)
from the literature adopted from Faulkner's (2001) disaster
management framework, and the implementation of the same
model by Faulkner and Vikulov (2001) and Ritchie (2004),
which proposed that disaster responses could be categorized
into six stages: pre-event phase, when planning for the disas-
ters and trying to prevent and mitigate their effects; prodor-
mal phase, the need to activate the managerial plans where
the hospitality industry has no choice of avoidance and must
face the hazards; emergency phase, when the disaster strikes
and begins doing damage to the destination; intermediate
phase, where emergency plans should be adopted to help
people and satisfy their needs; recovery phase, where the
long-term plans should be applied and affected destination
should be rebuilt; and finally in the resolution phase, crisis
management should be evaluated and improved and organi-
zational learning should be undertaken, to plan for the next
hazards and try to mitigate the effect of the next disasters
(Faulkner, 2001; Faulkner & Vikulov, 2001; Ritchie, 2004).
Method
This study seeks to explore the existing literature on hospi-
tality emergency management and preparedness. It pro-
poses a theoretical framework explaining the relationship
between emergency preparedness, planning, and safety and
security within the hotel industry. To strengthen the discus-
sion, the results of former studies have been used. As a con-
ceptual article, the methodology will include a review of
secondary data from different resources such as published
journals, books, and conference proceeding papers to
explain the existing concepts (Chaudhary, 1991). A review
of previous hazards affecting the hotel industry will pro-
vide information regarding emergency preparedness, and
planning (Abbott, 1983).
Findings and Discussions
Hotels have become an easy target for terrorists because of
several factors, including easy, open access with 24 hr of
operation, many public and multiple entrances, meeting
rooms, conferences organized, encounters with strangers
and foreigners, and restaurants (Horner & Swarbrooke,
2004). Henderson et al. (2010) stated that hotel designers
and architects should be aware of safety and security prin-
ciples as hotel parking, entrances, and lobbies are vulnera-
ble to terrorist attacks. However, security awareness among
scholars and practitioners has been on the rise since
September 11, allowing hotels to adopt and install safeguard
surveillance, checking luggage and cars, personal metal
detectors, and collaboration with airports and aviation com-
panies (Tarlow, 2009).
In this regard, although hotels invest a lot to install protec-
tive techniques to improve the safety of guests and property,
nonetheless terrorists have become more organized and
sophisticated, using different methods to harm people and

organizations. Organizations invest many resources to
improve security but terrorists use less resources while pre-
senting a high risk to harm these systems (Then & Loosemore,
2006). New additional systems have emerged to protect the
hotel entrances such as surveillance cameras, employees'
emergency checks at the employee entrance, and guest veri-
fication before reissuing the room key, which also should
control the access to the elevator and guest floors. Employees
should be motivated to be partners with the emergency pro-
cess and report any suspicious accident or object to the secu-
rity department (Henderson et al., 2010).
From his point of view, Faulkner (2001) noticed that there
are a limited number of studies that focus on disasters and
crisis management within the hotel industry. In addition, the
essential needs for crisis management are to increase safety
and security awareness among practitioners, managers, and
stakeholders (Chan & Lam, 2013), to improve the written
emergency plans and avoid lack of training and equipment
(Kano, Ramirez, Ybarra, Frias, & Bourque, 2007). Rooney
and White (2007) found lack of emergency plans focusing on
people with disabilities, which shows the need to update the
emergency plans to give them priority when performing an
evacuation. Furthermore, hotels should consider employing
a person with a disability within the emergency team. Kapucu
and Khosa (2013) identified the main substantial factors in
the emergency preparedness plan, and demonstrate a lack of
leadership and coordination at the level of preparedness.
Aframework was developed by Racherla and Hu (2009) in
their study about tourism that integrates effectiveness with
knowledge management when planning and dealing with the
hazards. They mentioned that organizations respond to the
crisis in relation to their own agenda, and a lack of resources
and confidence among organization prevents knowledge
sharing between the hospitality organizations that are often in
competition. In contrast, Henderson (2008) found an insuffi-
cient level of preparedness and planning for the next hazard.
As mentioned previously, efficient preparedness and
planning for the crisis in the prodormal stage and emergency
management plans have a critical role in the emergency man-
agement (Cavanaugh, Gelles, Reyes, Civiello, & Zahner,
2008; Malhotra & Venkatesh, 2009). Hospitality and tourism
practitioners such as Faulkner (2001), Ritchie (2004), and
Santana (2004) proposed crisis management models, describ-
ing the crisis stages--precrisis, during the crisis, and postcri-
sis--using several measurements. Carlsen and Liburd (2008)
argued that the effects of crises increased because of insuffi-
cient preparedness and planning for the next hazards, caus-
ing deeper impacts and a long retro-gradation to the
destination. Hospitality and tourism practitioners asserted
that emergency planners should focus on the prodormal stage
of preparedness, planning, and prevention.
The emergency management plans should be adopted,
validated, and evaluated to ensure the crisis prevention,
which enhances the ability to detect crisis signals that will
minimize losses. However, during the emergency stage, the
focus is on evacuation and communication to ensure imme-
diate response and coordination to resolve the crisis. After
the crisis has occurred, the focus will be on recovery and
learning which helps the businesses to recover and retain
customers (Faulkner, 2001; Paraskevas & Arendell, 2007;
Ritchie, 2004; Santana, 2004).
Emergency practitioners argued that efforts should be
taken to mitigate the effects of the crisis and hazard events
before the disaster happened to minimize the losses. Fink
(1986) clarified that it is very difficult to recognize the warn-
ing signals for all the events. Damage to the organization
began while the crisis moved from the prodormal to the acute
stage. In this case, damages will fluctuate with regard to the
organization's preparedness level (see Figure 2). Furthermore,
Roberts (1994) illustrated his four-stage crisis model explain-
ing the mitigation efforts and preparation in the pre-event
stage, while efforts should be made to organize to save people
and property during the emergency stage (see Figure 3).

After the crisis strikes, efforts should start immediately to
overcome and restore essential services, finally continuous
planning and long-term strategies to be prepared for the crisis
should be the goals in the long-term stage.
Reviewing the literature, practitioners suggest different
models to deal with the hazards and disaster, to minimize the
negative impacts and prevent losses in the hospitality indus-
try. Evans and Elphick (2005) suggested in their model that
when dealing with emergencies, there are two typologies of
crisis: "cobra" and "python" (see Figure 4). "Cobra" relates to
sudden disasters such as September 11 or Amman bombing,
which essentially lead to a preventive response, while
"python" relates to repeated disasters affecting the organiza-
tions. They argued that organizations must enforce collabora-
tion with the national emergency preparedness to reduce the
potential impact of such phenomena (see Figure 4).
Finally, the evaluation and feedback in the resolution
stage are very important to the hospitality organizations to
recover from a disaster and return back to normal operations.
Hospitality should overcome the disaster impacts whether
positive or negative, reduce their severity or obtain benefits
as guests, and tourists may change their travel plan to a safer
destination; examples include the U.S. tourists changing
their travel plans from the Middle East to the Caribbean dur-
ing the Gulf war in 1991 (Ritchie, 2004) and the Arabian
Gulf tourists from the Middle East to the Far East during the
Arab spring revolution (AlBattat, Mat Som, Ghaderi, &
Abukhalifeh, 2013).
Faulkner (2001) noticed that disasters could be a turning
point for the destination, positive or negative. It can create
heroes who can manage and guide the organizations to over-
come the hazard and return to normal operations (Burnett,
1999). With the ability to learn from crises, hospitality man-
agement should modify or adopt new strategies. Furthermore,
a feedback loop should benefit proactive preparedness and
effective planning to prepare for future disasters (Ritchie,
2004). As mentioned by Ritchie, Dorrell, Miller, and Miller
(2004), the organizational learning from the disasters is
determined by the interest to learn from hazardous events.
They argued that British organizations make very few
changes to their research because they think that these events
cannot be predicted or forecasted.
Kolb (1984) proposed his loop learning and educational
theory. He asserted that double-loop learning needs a para-
digmatic model using knowledge and experience gained
from the crisis and, to conclude, it requires a new concept
compared with single-loop learning (see Figures 5 and 6).
People who suffer from disasters are more capable of

reacting to a hazardous event by a single-loop action. The
organization will modify its plans, collaborate on efforts,
enhance communication systems, redistribute its resources,
and increase its marketing campaign to overcome the impact
of the events (Ritchie, 2004).
Conclusion
The hospitality industry is one of the most vulnerable indus-
tries to crises. More than before, crises are becoming more
frequent and complex, affecting the hospitality industry and
other related industries. Operating 24 hr a day, hotels become
a soft target for terrorists and criminal activities. Thus, it is
better to be well prepared to overcome and mitigate the poten-
tial impacts of such natural or man-made crisis events.
Rittichainuwat (2005) asserted that marketing the destination
as being less expensive could not motivate tourists to visit
hazardous destinations. Furthermore, safety and security are
two of the most important factors for the guests, when com-
pared with low price. Communication and media relations
will clear the marketing message and release any ambiguity
about the situation, with effective collaboration between
media and government authorities to remove fears and avoid
transmitting unnecessary information (Mansfeld, 2006).
Emergency preparedness plays a significant role in the orga-
nization. Plans should be adopted, evaluated, and updated.
Managerial commitment and managers' awareness provide
necessary resources and effective training to minimize losses,
and mitigate the effects of hazards. Safety surveillance and
security systems are indispensable to the guests in the hospi-
tality properties; practitioners argued that this could be used
as a marketing tool for tourists, guests, and meeting planners.
Finally, organizational single- and double-loop learning from
the crisis will help hospitality practitioners to understand hos-
pitality management emergency frameworks, develop proac-
tive planning, and evaluate a strategy's effectiveness, and
give them the opportunities to adopt and implement new ideas
and strategies to deal with emergencies and hazardous events.
