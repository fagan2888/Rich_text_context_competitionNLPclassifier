Socioeconomic status (SES) is a known risk factor for
cardiovascular disease.1,2 However, unlike traditional
Framingham risk factors, SES does not directly impact the
cardiovascular system but exerts its cardiovascular effects via
a complex interaction of biobehavioral factors, such as
exercise and diet (Figure). Because these mediating behav-
ioral factors are potentially modifiable, elucidating the path-
ways by which SES influences cardiovascular disease offers
important opportunities for preventive interventions that may,
in turn, help to address health disparities among social
groups.
It was toward this aim of understanding the role of
mediating factors in the association between SES and hyper-
tension that Brummett et al3 conducted a large cross-sectional
study using data from Wave IV (2007­2009) of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Using path models,
they found that, in 14 299 "nationally representative" Amer-
icans aged 24 to 35 years: (1) higher household income and
being married were independently associated with lower
systolic blood pressure (SBP), whereas older age, male sex,
black ethnicity, higher body mass index (BMI), greater waist
circumference, smoking, and higher alcohol intake were
independently associated with higher SBP in multivariable
modeling; (2) higher household income was associated with
lower SBP by way of lower resting heart rate (offsetting the
SBP-raising effects of increased alcohol consumption) and
remained inversely associated with SBP even after adjusting
for all measured covariates, and, in fact, each $50 000
increase was related to a decrease in SBP of 0.61 mm Hg; and
(3) higher education level was similarly associated with lower
SBP by way of lower BMI, smaller waist circumference, and
lower resting heart rate, but was no longer significantly
related to SBP after accounting for these indirect effects. The
authors concluded that increased BMI, particularly central
obesity, and higher resting heart rate were important media-
tors of the association between lower SES and higher SBP.
That obesity emerged as a chief link between lower
educational status and higher SBP (Figure) in the study by
Brummett et al3 may not be surprising at first glance­the
association of lower SES with higher BMI and higher SBP
has been observed in other developed countries1,4 and has
been attributed to lack of knowledge regarding dietary
choices, lack of access to healthy foods in lower SES areas,5
poorer weight management skills, or differing social norms
related to body size.6 However, the findings of Brummett et
al3 are striking when one takes into account how young the
American National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
sample was (all in their 20s and early 30s): the majority
(60%) of these young adults were prehypertensive (SBP
120 mm Hg) or overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2), whereas 1
in 10 were hypertensive (SBP 140 mm Hg) and 1 in 3
obese (BMI 30 kg/m2).3 Furthermore, whereas the current
results were limited to cross-sectional data, longitudinal
studies have demonstrated that lower SES exerts long-term
effects on both obesity7 and SBP.8 These data underscore the
urgency to address the "epidemic" of obesity in the young,
particularly central obesity, which may be part of the meta-
bolic syndrome, where focused efforts in the socially disad-
vantaged may help to reduce the burden of hypertension and
address cardiovascular health disparities in later adulthood.
Higher heart rate was identified by Brummett et al3 as
another important link between lower SES and higher SBP
(Figure). Higher heart rate may be a surrogate measure of
increased psychosocial stress or reduced physical fitness. A
host of adverse psychosocial factors have been found to be
increased in lower SES groups, including hostility,9 depres-
sion, and social isolation, and these stressors may lead to
higher resting heart rates and increased SBP via sympathetic
overactivity. Although psychosocial factors were not directly
measured in the current study, the "protective" effect of being
married suggested a role for social support, and previous
studies have shown that perceived stress and depression were
significant mediators of the association between lower SES
and increased SBP.4 The significance of these findings lies in
the potential for preventive interventions, such as promoting
healthy stress coping skills and regular aerobic exercise.
Taken together, it is tempting to oversimplify the associa-
tion between SES and SBP as such: socially disadvantaged
individuals face job and neighborhood stressors, which,
coupled with lack of knowledge and limited resources, drive
these individuals to low-cost, high-calorie fast food options,
resulting in obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and hyperten-
sion; chronic ill health may then limit job opportunities,
creating even more stress and perpetuating the vicious cycle.
The association may not, however, be that straightforward for
the following reasons. Firstly, the SES-obesity-SBP link can
change in its direction of association­in undeveloped or
developing countries, BMI increases with higher SES and
contributes to a direct association between higher SES and

higher SBP.1 Obesity is not, therefore, an inevitable conse-
quence of social deprivation, and much depends on the state
of development of the country. Second, variations in SES
may have different effects depending on sex and ethnicity.
The relationship between lower SES and higher SBP is
stronger in women than in men.1 Among women alone,
SES-SBP inverse associations are stronger in black Ameri-
cans than in Mexican Americans.10 Third, even if SES
disparities were eliminated among sexes and ethnicities, the
prevalence of hypertension would still be greater in black
than in white Americans,2,10 suggesting inherent genetic
predisposition or other unmeasured explanatory factors.
Some of these unmeasured factors are sodium and potassium
intake, psychosocial stress factors not captured by heart rate,
stress coping mechanisms, and complex neighborhood-
specific social effects not reflected in education level or
household income (Figure).
It is intriguing that income, but not education, retained an
independent effect on SBP after adjusting for all measured
covariates in the study by Brummett et al3: earning $50 000
more was related to having a 0.6-mm Hg lower SBP. As a
measure of SES, education has the advantages of being
reliably recalled and unaffected by later adult health so that
reverse causality is less of an issue (poor adult health cannot
change previous educational attainment in healthy adoles-
cence). Income, on the other hand, may be affected by adult
health in that poor health may lead to lower income and vice
versa (problem of reverse causality). Conversely, higher
income may reflect not only greater occupational earning and
purchasing power but may incorporate more proxy effects of
better SES and better overall health, explaining how earning
more may buy a lower SBP or, perhaps, how a lower SBP can
buy greater earnings.
Low SES should be recognized as a potent risk factor for
hypertension, even among young adults in the United States.
Although SES, per se, is not regarded as a "treatable" risk
factor, its impact on blood pressure may be modified by better
understanding of, and intervening on, its mediating mecha-
nisms. The study by Brummett et al3 has contributed to this
understanding, revealing obesity and increased heart rate (as
a measure of psychosocial stress or poor physical fitness, both
potentially leading to increased sympathetic traffic to the
heart and vasculature) as key modifiable correlates of lower
SES and higher SBP. Given the cross-sectional nature of
these data, however, causality cannot be proven, and the
impact of losing weight or reducing heart rate (via better
stress management or aerobic exercise) on SES-related dif-
ferences in SBP cannot be conclusively determined. None-
theless, the Hypertension Detection and Follow-Up Program
has demonstrated that intensive blood pressure control has the
greatest positive impact in hypertensive individuals of the
lowest SES, attenuating the SES-related excess mortality in
hypertension.11 Thus, regardless of mechanism for hyperten-
sion, clinicians should be reminded that aggressive blood
pressure control is an available and effective means to
address social disparities in outcomes among hypertensive
individuals.
