cerebral infarction
Zhibin Zhou1, Xiaohao Li2, Bo Yang3 and Dan Jiang1
Abstract
Objective: To investigate the correlation between plasma lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and carotid atheromatous plaque stability in patients with cerebral
infarction.
Method: Patients with cerebral infarction underwent carotid artery duplex ultrasonography and
transcranial Doppler monitoring for detection of microemboli. Patients were stratified by plaque
type (no plaque, intima thickening, unstable plaque, stable plaque) and presence or absence of
micoremboli. Plasma LPA and MMP-9 were quantified.
Result: LPA and MMP-9 concentrations were significantly higher and microemboli positivity was
significantly more common in patients with unstable plaque (n ¼ 21) than the other three groups
(intima thickening, n ¼ 16; stable plaque n ¼ 41; no plaque; n ¼ 12). There was a significant positive
correlation between LPA and MMP-9 concentrations.
Conclusion: Plasma LPA and MMP-9 concentrations may be useful biomarkers in the clinical
identification and prediction of unstable plaque, and in guiding treatment.

Introduction
Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a low
molecular weight, mildly oxidized,
low-density lipoprotein that is released
from activated platelets. Via activation of
its G protein-coupled receptors, LPA exerts
a range of effects on the cardiovascular
system including modulation of platelet
activation, recruitment and activation of
inflammatory cells, and migration, pheno-
typic modulation and proliferation of vas-
cular smooth muscle cells.1­5 It is therefore
critically involved in thrombosis and vascu-
lar diseases such as atherosclerosis and
vascular remodelling.
Lysophosphatidic acid accumulates in
the lipid-rich core of carotid atherosclerotic
plaque6 and is released during plaque rup-
ture, when it activates platelets and can lead
to intra-arterial thrombus formation.7
Typically, LPA is present in very small
amounts in human plasma and tissues, and
is released under pathological conditions
such as injury and thrombosis.8 Tissue
remodelling processes within plaque,
mainly regulated by matrix metalloprotei-
nases (MMPs), also play a major role in the
pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. MMP-
9, a member of the MMP superfamily, is
implicated in the pathophysiology of plaque
rupture, which is the most common mech-
anism responsible for acute ischaemic car-
diac disease and cerebral stroke.9 MMP-9 is
also associated with atherosclerotic arterial
remodelling10 and is actively synthesized in
vulnerable plaques.11 Elevated plasma levels
of MMP-9 in the peripheral blood have been
demonstrated in patients with acute coron-
ary syndrome (ACS)12 and are associated
with severe coronary stenosis13 and cardio-
vascular mortality.14 Elevated plasma
MMP-9 concentrations in the coronary cir-
culation of patients with ACS indicate that
MMP-9 production may be enhanced in
these patients.15,16 Investigation of the rela-
tionship between LPA, MMP-9, and carotid
atheromatous plaque stability in patients
with cerebral infarction is far from ade-
quate, however.
The aim of the present study was to
determine the relationship between plasma
LPA and MMP-9, and carotid atheroma-
tous plaque stability in patients with
cerebral infarction, and to explore its sig-
nificance in the evaluation of vulnerable
carotid plaque.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients diagnosed with
cerebral infarction in the arteriae carotis
interna system who were admitted to the
Department of Neurology, Tianyou
Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University of
Science and Technology, Wuhan, China,
between November 2012 and April 2013.
Diagnoses were made according to criteria
established during the Fourth Chinese
National Cerebrovascular Disease
Academic Meeting (1995).17 Exclusion cri-
teria were: cancer; surgery or major trauma
in the previous month; obvious signs or
clinical evidence of hospital-acquired infec-
tion. Full clinical history and neurological
examination were performed for each
patient.
The Ethics Committee of Tianyou
Hospital approved the study, and all
patients provided written informed consent.
Carotid artery duplex ultrasonography
Carotid artery duplex ultrasonography
examination was performed with an ATL
HDIÕ 5000 imaging system (Philips,
Andover, MA, USA). With the patient
lying in a supine position, the extracranial
carotid arteries were imaged in the longitu-
dinal (anterior, lateral and posterior views)
and transverse planes. Both common car-
otid arteries, carotid bifurcations and
670 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
internal carotid arteries were examined for
the presence of atherosclerotic plaque.
When plaque was visualized, the image of
the thickest plaque was frozen and the
intima­media wall thickness (IMT, includ-
ing the plaque) was measured with an elec-
tronic cursor and recorded as the maximal
carotid plaque thickness. IMT > 1.2 mm was
defined as carotid plaque, and IMT
!0.8 mm­ 1.2 mm was defined as thickened
intima. Carotid plaque was divided into four
types: flat, hard, soft and mixed, according
to the ultrasound audiovisual pathology
classification of plaque.18 Flat and hard
types are stable, while soft and mixed types
are vulnerable.
Transcranial Doppler monitoring
All patients were monitored with transcra-
nial Doppler (TCD) for 1 h preoperatively, 3
days after onset of stroke. Continuous TCD
monitoring of the bilateral middle cerebral
artery was performed with an EMETC-2020
TCD unit (Nicolet Biomedical, Madison,
WI, USA). Signals were recorded on digital
audiotape for offline analysis and interpret-
ation of embolic signals as described.19
Patients were classified as microembolic
signal-positive or microembolic signal-
negative.
LPA and MMP-9 quantification
Peripheral blood (10 ml) was collected from
each patient within 24 h after TCD moni-
toring for quantification of plasma LPA and
MMP-9. For MMP-9, blood was immedi-
ately mixed with sodium ethylenediamene
tetra-acetic acid (EDTA,) centrifuged at
3000 g for 5 min at room temperature,
separated, and stored at À80C until use.
MMP-9 was quantified using one-step sand-
wich enzyme immunoassay (Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
For LPA, blood was collected in tubes
containing EDTA, and plasma was collected
and either processed immediately or stored
at À70C until lipid extraction. LPA was
quantified by colorimetric assay of platelet-
poor plasma as described,20 following lipid
extraction at 0C to 4C to minimize
damage to ester bonds.21
Vascular risk factors
Study definitions were: smoking, current or
previous tobacco use; hypertension, high
blood pressure requiring treatment; dia-
betes, insulin- or noninsulin-dependent dia-
betes requiring treatment (including dietary
control); hyperlipidaemia, current treat-
ment and/or fasting lipid concentrations
(total cholesterol ! 6.2 mmol/l or triglycer-
ides ! 2.3 mmol/l).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SEM.
Between group differences in LPA
and MMP-9 were analysed using Student's
t-test for pairwise comparisons and one-way
analysis of variance for multiple compari-
sons. Between-group comparisons of the
incidence of microembolic-positivity were
made using 2-test. Pearson correlation
coefficient was used to analyse the relation-
ship between LPA and MMP-9 concentra-
tions. P-values <0.05 were considered
statistically significant. All statistical ana-
lyses were performed with SPSSÕ version
19.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Results
The study included 90 patients (58 male/32
female; mean age 62.7 Æ 12.9 years; age
range 47­78 years). When stratified accord-
ing to carotid artery duplex ultrasonography
findings, 12 patients had no plaque, 16 had
thickened intima, 21 had unstable plaque
and 41 had stable plaque. There were no

ences in demographic characteristics or vas-
cular risk factors (smoking, hypertension,
diabetes and hyperlipidaemia; Table 1).
Data regarding MMP-9 and LPA con-
centrations and the presence of microemboli
in patients stratified according to plaque
findings are shown in Table 2. LPA and
MMP-9 concentrations were significantly
higher, and microemboli-positivity was sig-
nificantly more common, in patients with
unstable plaque than the three other groups
(P < 0.01 for LPA and MMP-9; P < 0.001
for emboli; Table 2). LPA and MMP-9
concentrations were significantly lower in
the no-plaque group than in all other groups
(P < 0.05 for each comparison; Table 2). In
addition, LPA concentrations were signifi-
cantly higher in the thickened intima group
than the stable plaque group (P < 0.01;
Table 2). There was a significant positive
correlation between LPA and MMP-9 con-
centrations in the study population as a
whole (r ¼ 0.453, P < 0.05; Figure 1).

Discussion
The structural integrity of atherosclerotic
plaque depends on its extracellular matrix,
which is continually remodelled.22 Acute
changes within the plaque, such as haemor-
rhage, cap rupture and cap ulceration, pre-
cede the onset of clinical ischaemic events.22
Each phase of the atherosclerotic process is
mediated by MMPs,23 which are the main
physiological regulators of the extracellular
matrix. The zinc-dependent endopeptidase
MMP-9 is synthesized and secreted in
monomeric form as a zymogen,24 is asso-
ciated with atherosclerotic arterial remodel-
ling,10 and is actively synthesized in
vulnerable plaque.11 MMP-9 affects plaque

stability in association with various inflam-
matory cytokines.25,26
Lysophosphatidic acid regulates inflam-
mation in many cell types inducing wound
healing, cell proliferation, and the expression
of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, inter-
leukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant pro-
tein-1 and MMP-2.27 LPA can activate
mononuclear cells and T lymphocytes, and
promote their expression and secretion of
MMPs,28 resulting in plaque instability and
disruption. The LPA-induced migration of T
cells and MMP secretion that occurs in
atheromatous plaque can accelerate cap
degradation and eventually lead to plaque
rupture.29 In addition, LPA can increase
plaque instability by upregulating the expres-
sion of proinflammatory cytokines and adhe-
sion molecules, promoting inflammatory cell
migration and infiltration, and inhibiting
apoptosis of macrophages and T lympho-
cytes.29 Plaque infiltrated by a large number
of inflammatory cells has been shown to have
a high positive rate of microemboli, and
could lead to cerebral infarction.30 Others
have demonstrated a significant positive
correlation between plaque MMP-9 concen-
trations and TCD findings.31
Levels of LPA in human atheromatous
plaques have been shown to be 13-fold
higher than in normal arterial tissue, with
the highest LPA concentrations present in
the lipid-rich core.3 LPA was found to be the
primary platelet-activating lipid in athero-
sclerotic plaques, with other lipid fractions
having comparatively minor biological
activity.3 Intravascular ultrasound assess-
ment of the culprit lesion in patients pre-
senting with acute myocardial infarction or
unstable angina found MMP-9 to be an
independent predictor of plaque rupture,
even after adjustment for the traditional risk
factors C-reactive protein and troponin.32 In
patients with acute coronary syndrome,
MMP-9 concentrations were 1.4­2.0-fold
higher in those with plaque rupture com-
pared with those without, supporting the
association between plasma MMP-9 and
plaque rupture.32 Concentrations of LPA
and MMP-9 in the plasma of patients with
cerebral infarction in the present study were
significantly higher in those with unstable
plaque than in those with no plaque,
thickened intima or stable plaque. In add-
ition, the present finding that plasma LPA
and MMP-9 concentrations were signifi-
cantly higher in patients with evidence of
microemboli than in those without micro-
emboli suggests that LPA and MMP-9 are
closely related to the formation and disrup-
tion of unstable plaque. It is possible that
the high concentration of LPA present in the
lipid core of atherosclerotic plaque was
exposed following cap rupture, resulting in
local embolus formation. This may manifest
as transient ischaemic symptoms or clinical
acute cerebral infarction. Local embolus
after plaque rupture may then produce
additional LPA, forming a positive
feedback loop.

The present finding of a positive correl-
ation between LPA and MMP-9 concen-
trations is in accordance with a study in a
rat atherosclerotic plaque model.33 This
correlation may be due to LPA-induced
production of tumour necrosis factor-a,
which then enhances MMP-9 expression
and activity and influences the stability of
atherosclerotic plaque.25,29 Limitations of
the present study were that cerebral infarc-
tion may influence LPA and MMP-9
release. In addition, plasma LPA levels
may be influenced by certain medicines,
such as aspirin. Also, plaque stability was
only determined by the ultrasound audio-
visual pathology classification; further
pathological examination of plaque sec-
tions would have provided importatnt
information. In conclusion, plasma LPA
and MMP-9 concentrations may be useful
biomarkers in the clinical identification and
prediction of unstable plaque and in guid-
ing treatment.
