Introduction
Textbooks are core learning materials or documents within
the field of education both in printed but also more and more
in electronic form. They are aimed at two crucial groups,
namely those to be educated (pupils and students) and also
the educators (teachers and professors). Therefore, they are
of immanent research interest as one of the instruments that
teachers use when trying to achieve curricular objectives, but
they are also often teaching devices on their own as in the
last instance the use of textbooks could theoretically replace
instruction itself. With regard to this powerful role, it is not
unusual that textbooks are a matter of regulation within
numerous educational policies--they are more or less tightly
controlled texts. Both the ways in which textbooks are regu-
lated and the regulated texts themselves are places where
various ideologies are invested. As put by Apple and
Christian-Smith (1991) in The Politics of the Textbook, ". . .
texts are not simply `delivery systems' of `facts.' They are at
once the results of political, economic, and cultural activi-
ties, battles and compromises" (p. 1).
In this article, we will explore the analytical posssibilities
of Grice's general cooperative principle and the maxims con-
nected with it, mainly the maxim of quantity, maxim of qual-
ity, maxim of relation/relevance, and the maxim of manner
for the analysis of ideologies that are a part of different texts
within the field of education. This theoretical frame will be
used for the textual analysis of samples from two specific
types of documents: a legal text of a regulation and excerpts
from a textbook. The first set of examples stem from a
Slovenian regulation on textbook approval, the second set
from a history textbook. In both cases, Grice's ideas will be
used to identify implicatures within texts that act as indices
of underlying ideological premises.
Our aim is to present an analysis based on Grice's ideas in
a manner that should allow for the application of those and
similar principles in the everyday teacher's task of evaluat-
ing the numerous educational texts, but especially in the pro-
cess of choosing the textbooks the pupils have to buy and use
for instruction.
Grice's General Cooperative Principle

Analysis of Texts in the Field of Education:
A Regulation on Textbook Approval and a
History Textbook
Eva Klemencic1 and Mitja Cepic Vogrincic1
Abstract
The educational discourse is one of the primary places where numerous dominant ideological premises are established.
These discursive constructions are usually not expressed explicitly but are tacit or covered. In other words, ideological
premises are not conveyed via ideational (dictionary) meaning of utterances. The analysis therefore has to tackle not
the grammatical or logical layer of the text but has to look into the pragmatic aspect of discourse or text in the social
communication. In this way, Grice developed his idea of cooperative principle in the analysis of pragmatic rules (maxims)
that speakers use in head-to-head interactions to make themselves understood. The violation of those rules usually means
that the speaker is making a "conversational" implicature, that is, an implication that cannot be inferred from his spoken
contribution but assumes some common knowledge or presupposition. Conversational implicatures are therefore the places
where ideological presuppositions can be detected. Grice's maxims are used in the analysis of two distinct types of texts in
the field of education--a regulation on textbook approval and a history textbook. In both texts, Grice's principles are used
to uncover ideological premises.

contribution such as is required, at the stage at which occurs,
by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in
which you are engaged" (p. 26). In other words, he offered a
general principle that participants in conversation should fol-
low. Therefore, he introduced the term implicature.
Conversational implicature helps us so that our clauses suc-
ceed more than if they were actually "told," because our ver-
bal exchanges are, at least to some degree, a cooperative
effort--"every participant in their recognizing of a common
purpose, mutually received direction etc." (Kante, 1998,
p. 24). Consideration maxims (and sub-maxims), represented
in the execution, contribute to results with regard to general
cooperative principle.1
Conversational Implicature
The notion of conversational implicature (shortly implica-
ture) "is one of the single most important ideas in pragmat-
ics": (a) stands as a paradigmatic example of the nature and
power of pragmatic explanations of the linguistic phenom-
ena (offers some notable functional explanation of linguistic
facts), (b) provides some explicit account of how it is possi-
ble to mean more than what was actually said, (c) effects
substantial simplification in both the structure and the con-
tent of semantic description (Levinson, 2007, pp. 97-98).
It is necessary to differentiate between explicit messages
or explicatures (as in statements actually said) and implica-
tures (author's implicit messages), "which are inferentially
reconstructed from readers," that is, indirectly accessible
over operational inferences. Grice depicts the notion of
explicatures in terms of a speaker who "said that, . . .," and
implicatures in terms of a speaker who "gave me to know"
(Justin, 2001, as cited in Cepic & Vogrincic, 2003, p. 320).
Grice's example:
A and B are talking about mutual friend C, who is now working
in a bank. A asks B how C is getting on in his job, and B replies:
"Oh quite well, I think; he likes his colleagues and he hasn't
been to prison yet."
Upon hearing that, we could ask what does B want to hint at,
suggest or even what did he was mean when he said that C had
not yet been to prison. The answer might be different but "it is
clear whatever B implied, suggested, meant/ . . . /it is distinct
from what B said." (Grice, 1989/1991, p. 24)
The basic notion of Grice's conceptual "apparatus" therefore
is implicature, which has one of two forms: conventional or
conversational. Conventional implicatures, with simple
inferential operations, are attached to the conventional mean-
ing of words, and they are based on a multitude of rules and
principles (cooperative principle and maxims; Cepic &
Vogrincic, 2003). In the presence of single conversational
implicature, the listener will respond with regard to the fol-
lowing data: conventional meaning of the words used, coop-
erative principle and its maxims context (linguistic or
otherwise, of the utterance), background knowledge, and the
fact that all of the relevant items under the previous headings
are available to both participants (Grice, 1989/1991).
Maxims
"/M/axims specify what participants have to do in order to
converse in a maximally efficient, rational, cooperative way"
(Levinson, 1983/2007, p. 103). Grice identifies basic max-
ims of conversation and, in echoing Kant, calls these catego-
ries quantity, quality, relation, and manner.2 In addition, all of
these categories have their analogies in a field that is not talk
exchange.
The maxim of quantity. This relates to the quantity of infor-
mation to be provided, with two sub-maxims:

Make your contributions as informative as is required (for
the current purpose of the exchange);

Do not make your contribution more informative than is
required.
The maxim of quality.
Under this category falls the
supra-maxim:
 Try to make your contribution based on that is true.
and two sub-maxims:
 Do not say what you believe to be false;
 Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.
The maxim of relation. Under this category, he placed a single
maxim:
 Be relevant.
The maxim of manner. For Grice, the category of manner is
not related to what is said but rather (differently from other
categories) how what is said is to be said. Under that cate-
gory, he includes the sub-maxim:
 Be perspicuous.
and various maxims:
 Avoid obscurity of expression;
 Avoid ambiguity;
 Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity);
 Be orderly.
Klemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 3
Participants in a verbal exchange may fail to implement a
maxim because of various reasons: the violation of maxims,
opt out, clash, or flout of maxim (Grice, 1989/1991).
In short, obeying the cooperative principle and the
Gricean maxims is necessary to ensure that the human inter-
action by means of linguistic exchange is based on the
explicit meanings of the utterances within the particular
exchange. But the cooperative principle is not to be read as a
human ideal--it is a set of presuppositions on the properties
of utterances used to convey explicatures. Much of human
interaction involves breaches of Gricean maxims as it
involves implicit meanings, be it intentional or unintentional.
In the next section, we will try to demonstrate how Grice's
maxims and implicatures, which are accessible over inferen-
tial operations in the analysis of texts, can be used to get to
those implicit meanings. But let's first address the question,
why is the textbook still so important in schools?
Textbooks in Schools
Textbooks among other didactical materials are an important
element of the school system. In many cases, they provide
the supporting point for arranging teacher's schoolwork and
are, however, part of the pupil's everyday life (Barle &
Bezensek, 2006). The curriculum, its "factual" dimension,
the methods of content adaptation are in fact finalized and
fortified with textbooks. In the process of acquiring new
knowledge, "textbooks/ . . . /are usually the first and the most
important textual material" for pupils (Barle & Bezensek,
2006, p. 109). Still they are by far not the only means of sup-
port for teachers; neither is their use mandatory nor even uni-
form as a decision-making tool that helps deciding when and
how the teachers will use one or another learning device that
remains within the domain of their autonomy (Justin, 2003).
Normally, the choice of a particular textbook for a particular
subject is also within a teacher's autonomy as teachers today3
have the opportunity to choose from a number of different
textbooks on the market.
Although textbook publishing in developed countries is
mostly in the domain of market-driven publishing business,
this segment of book production and distribution still differs
from other segments of the (book) publishing industry. The
textbooks for primary and secondary education--the major-
ity of school-age population today go through these seg-
ments of educational systems--are in many (but not all)
countries submitted to various degrees of public regulation.
Slovenia has a system of textbook licensing, whereby a text-
book manuscript (in fact, it is a set workbooks complete with
illustrations and layout) is approved for use in primary and
secondary schools. This does not mean that other textbooks
cannot be used in the classroom but teachers are not allowed
to demand the purchase or lease of unapproved textbooks
from the pupils. However, there is no requirement for teach-
ers to use textbooks in the first place. The licensing system is
accompanied with the system of book funds in schools
through which pupils lease the textbooks required for a year,
returning them to the fund for further use. School book funds
are not allowed to buy books that are not officially approved.
The school book regulation is as said not a Slovenian spe-
cialty. We will just take a look at a few examples of large
markets. The textbooks go, for example, through the approval
process in neighboring Austria but also in Germany where
every federal state has its own regulation. Mostly, the text-
books are approved by the relevant ministry. In these cases,
the approval procedure is aimed at the quality of textbooks,
but the selection process is left to the teachers. But the
approval (or adoption) processes can also be found in the
United States, where as many as 19 federal states have the
system of providing free textbooks in public schools. Here,
the adoption process is actually the process of selecting the
textbook to be prescribed for the pupils. This selection pro-
cess can be accompanied by fierce ideological debate; for
example, the Texas Textbook debate that revolved around the
issue of creationism and the interpretation of history had the
most media coverage.4
Returning to Slovenian example, such a system creates
limitations to a teacher's autonomy in textbook selection
and, more importantly, shapes the editorial and business poli-
cies of textbook publishers. The system of school funds
requires that only a single title of a textbook for a subject per
school should be purchased for a certain period. The duration
of this period was not explicitly set by the regulation, but the
same regulation includes the provision under which the lease
of the textbook should not exceed one third of the purchase
price. As school funds are for the greater part self-financed
(partially they are subsidized by the Slovenian Ministry of
Education and Sport), this provision effectively means that
the teacher has the option to choose another textbook only
after a minimum period of 3 years. The one textbook per
subject also means that teachers who teach the same subject
have to negotiate which textbook to choose, thereby further
limiting their individual autonomy in shaping the learning
process. The 3-year rotation period (or longer) also seriously
influences the market conditions for publishers. As a vast
majority of pupils lease rather than buy textbooks, that de
facto means that the textbook market size is only about one
third of the target group and that holds only for the compul-
sory subjects. Regarding the small size of the Slovenian pri-
mary and secondary school textbook market, the economics
of textbook production is tight. Still at least in the segment of
textbooks for compulsory curriculum in primary schools,
several textbooks from different publishers are available for
every one of the subjects.5
As excerpts of the rules on approving textbooks will be a
matter of closer text analysis later, the procedure and its
requirements will be only outlined here. In short, publishers
have to submit a finished textbook, set in total with proofread
text and illustrations to a commission named by the Ministry
of Education and Sport.6 The commission sends them for
reviews (by outside experts) concerning linguistic adequacy
4 SAGE Open
and scientific accuracy and compliance of the textbook with
the curriculum for the relevant subjects, assessing its method-
ical and didactical approach, the quality of layout and illus-
trations, and suitability of the textbooks for the developmental
stage of pupils. This part of the assessment process is carried
out by state-run institutes working in the field of education.
Formally, according to the regulation, the assessment pro-
cess ends either with approval or rejection of the proposed
textbook; in other words, there is no formal way to amend
the textbook according to the comments by the reviewers
within the approval process itself. In practice, however, sug-
gestions for improvements are submitted to the publisher to
be implemented within the same approval procedure.7
The legal framework of textbook publishing provides
some boundaries and directions to the process of creating
textbook content. Within these limitations, the distinction
between textbooks and other textual media concerns the spe-
cifics of the transformation of scientific content, which is, in
a textbook, suitably structured, remodeled, and simplified.
The transformation is understandable under the presupposi-
tion that pupils (for whom the textbooks are designed) are
not able to learn the scientific content in a no-remake form,
as this would be first an unaccomplishable cognitive process
and second they do not have enough previous knowledge
necessary to read those kinds of texts. A textbook therefore
serves as an agent (Kovac, Sebart, Krek, Stefanc, & Vidmat,
2005).
Kuhn, who had already thought about the popularization
of science, was convinced that scientists, as laymen, draw a
large part of their own conceptions about creative scientific
activity from authoritarian sources (which systematically
conceal existence and a sense of scientific revolutions). From
the authority point of view, he thought about three categories
of publications: scientific textbooks, popularization, and
philosophical works. All of them have one common link
which the scientific society presently acknowledges--the
starting point of their writing are problems, data, and theories
laid out most frequently within the particular complexity of
the paradigm (Kuhn, 1962/1998). The aim is the transmis-
sion of vocabulary and syntax of contemporary scientific
language. It is important "that scientific concepts are made
accessible to the students in a number of different ways,"
both in teaching and in textbooks (Ahtineva, 2005, p. 26).
The process of vulgarization of the scientific discourse
into the more generally comprehensible and didactically use-
ful textbook discourse is a necessarily ideological one. For
our purpose, we will define ideology as
the basis of the social representations shared by members of a
group. This means that ideologies allow people as group
members to organise the multitude of social beliefs about what
is good or bad, right or wrong, for them, and to act accordingly.
(Van Dijk, 1998, p. 8)
In the context of science vulgarization, those actions
include the choice of knowledge permitted into the curricula,
the methods of vulgarization, the question of appropriateness
of knowledge for certain groups (i.e., age or gender) of
pupils, and the relationship between scientific knowledge
and other types of knowledge (i.e., beliefs be it religious or
political). At the same time, we must see the textbook--as
the prime example of vulgarized science and accompanying
ideologies--in (at least) two different functions: the function
of teaching and the function of learning. In the function of
learning (pupils learning activity), the focus is on the vulgar-
ization of scientific paradigms (meaning the transformation
of scientific knowledge into school subjects). In the function
of teaching, the focus is on the evaluation of the transforma-
tion of scientific paradigms in the context of teacher's educa-
tional practices.8
Cooperative Principle Applied
In our analysis, we will first take one step back in trying to
identify the ideological presuppositions of what a textbook is
in the first place, by analyzing its legal definition. After that,
examples from history textbooks will be analyzed. In both
cases, Grice's theory of cooperative principle will be utilized
as a tool for discerning implied content (implicatures) that is
often a good vantage point in finding ideological premises
underlying the text.
Analyzing the Legal Definition of a Textbook
We will start our analysis with the legal text, namely the
Pravilnik o potrjevanju ucbenikov [Regulation of Textbook
Approval]--one from 1996 and the other the present one
from 2010. The regulation from 1996 is the first under the
then new law on primary and secondary education under
which the reform of Slovenian educational system was car-
ried out. It is also the first regulation pertaining to an exclu-
sively market-driven textbook production. We chose the
comparative approach to show the crucial changes in the
period but also to demonstrate the ideologies accompanying
the textbook market regulation. We will focus on one impor-
tant part of both regulations, namely the paragraph in which
the materials that are under the regulation are defined. We
can begin with a simple juxtaposition:
Regulation of 1996, Paragraph 1:
In accordance with this regulation the following learning
materials are approved that are aimed at primary and secondary
school pupils, apprentices, students of post-secondary education
and participants of adult education (further: the participants of
education) for the mastering of educational goals stated in
curricula or catalogues of knowledge:
-textbooks,
-worksheets or workbooks,
-exercise compendia,
Klemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 5
-atlases,
-other learning materials that complement the textbook or are its
integral part (further: the textbook).
The provisions of this regulation are also used for the approval
of handbooks aimed at kindergarten personnel. (Regulation of
textbook approval, 1996, p. 5787)
Regulation of 2010, Paragraph 1:9
This regulation determines the way and procedure of the
approval of textbooks, aimed at primary and secondary school
pupils and participants of adult education (further: the
participants of education). Textbooks can be made for use in
printed, electronic or printed and electronic version. (Regulation
of textbook approval­Amendments, 2010, p. 6783)
Regulation of 2010, Paragraph 2:
The textbook is a basic learning material for achievement of
educational aims and standards of knowledge, defined in the
curriculum or in the catalogue of knowledge. It supports teaching
and learning with didactic-methodical organization of content
and adapted illustrations and graphical layout. The content and
the structure of the textbook allow for independent learning of
the participants of education and the acquisition of different
levels and categories of knowledge. The textbook should not
require any direct insertion of answers or solutions either written
or drawn, save in the case of the textbook, designed for the use
in electronic form (further e-textbook), that can allow for the
direct insertion. The textbook is tied to the school subject or a
topical-didactical set, grade and the level of education. A reader
as a compendium of texts chosen in accordance with the aims of
curriculum is also a textbook. (Regulation of textbook approval­
Amendments, 2010, p. 6783)
Already this simple juxtaposition shows important differ-
ences in the two documents. For this section whose function
is to define the matter (textbooks) entering the approval pro-
cedure, two strategies of definition are used. The earlier one
is simpler with three elements. Textbooks which are approved
are defined by (a) intended audience or in other words grade
and level of schooling, (b) content--adhering to curricula,
and (c) taxonomically listing the members of the category
textbook. The regulation of 2010 retains the first two charac-
teristics but omits the third. This simply reflects the change
in the textbook licensing policy. In 2010, only textbooks and
"readers"10 were licensed, which means that the range of
learning materials controlled by the state narrowed substan-
tially during the last two decades.
What is of more interest for our purposes is the addition of
the fourth element, namely the attempt to define the textbook
through its textual characteristics (didactical-methodical
organization of content, illustration, layout) and even more
curiously through its intended effects on its users (the acqui-
sition of different levels of knowledge, supporting teaching
and learning). In Gricean terms, the attempt at such a defini-
tion of the textbook represents both the violation of the
maxim of quantity and the maxim of manner. To begin with
the latter, one must first note that the attempted definition
hardly contributes to the clarification of the specific differ-
ence between "book" and "textbook," that is, a didactical-
methodical organization is a generalist term, which is already
strongly implied by the context (learning material for pri-
mary and secondary schools), thus providing no further clari-
fication. The same can be said of the requirement that
textbooks should support teaching and learning. In both
cases, we could speak of unnecessary prolixity, stating the
obvious or repeating what is already implied a few lines
earlier.
What is even more problematic is the requirement that
textbooks should allow for the acquisition of different levels
or categories of knowledge. The obvious implication is that
there is a common understanding (at least in the context of
[Slovenian] education) of what those "levels" and "catego-
ries" are as the regulation itself does not provide or at least
hint at the definition of any of those terms. However, without
explication both can be understood in a myriad of different
ways, which de facto renders the clause unusable for the pur-
poses of the regulation itself, namely providing relevant and,
in the first place, equal criteria for the textbook assessment.
This interpretation, which applies the charity principle, pre-
supposing that other principles use the words in an ordinary
way, has to give way to the interpretation more in line of
Grice's implicatures that there is a specific meaning to these
terms known to addressees of the regulation. In this specific
meaning, "levels" or "categories" of knowledge pertain to
Bloom's taxonomy of learning, which is according to Justin
(2008, p. 16) heavily misused in the Slovenian educational
discourse. We will not go into the details of Bloom's taxon-
omy or its (mis)use in Slovenian pedagogy as for the present
purpose a more generalist critique should be sufficient.
Bloom's taxonomy (or any other attempt to categorize differ-
ent types of learning) is a specific theoretical tool that was
not designed for the purpose of evaluating textbooks and
therefore such a specific framework should not be a constitu-
tive element of the regulation that defines the licensing of
textbooks in general.11 The fact that the reference to Bloom
is not explicit constitutes the violation of Grice's maxim of
manner: avoid the obscurity of expression.
All in all, the entire attempt at defining the textbook also
amounts to the violation of the maxim of quantity. The con-
tribution--in this case the definition--is more informative
than required in the context of textbook licensing regulation,
as the criteria for the textbook assessment are clearly laid
down in latter paragraphs of the regulation. Trying to define
a textbook in this odd manner does not add much if anything
at all to the information within the regulation itself.
What implicature do we read from these violations of
Grice's maxims? The attempt at closely defining the text-
book indicates a certain misunderstanding of the general
6 SAGE Open
concept of the "rule of law" in present day Slovenia. It is
often thought that most, if not every social and political
issue, should be solved by passing a law or regulation, writ-
ten in a detailed manner, that allows those affected by the law
to fulfill what is stated in it by simply putting checks for each
prescribed requirement. This means that the responsibility of
the individual before the law is guaranteed by a largely auto-
mated process of simple "do's" and "don'ts." The problem is
that lawmakers cannot foresee all of the concrete situations,
that the law or regulation will be applied to, which leads to a
never-ending flood of amendments (also true for analyzed
regulation). As the case of textbook definition shows, many
things in the social world cannot be easily defined in a sim-
ple, taxonomically correct manner suitable to legal texts. As
we demonstrated, attempts at such definitions easily end in a
paradoxical mess.
From these implications, it can be inferred that there is a
tacit tendency to closely control the textbook production
which has to be tacit because it opposes the idea of decentral-
ized and market-driven provision of learning materials. The
idea of the state provision of the unified learning materials
has some currency in Slovenian public (and media) discourse
on education. It rests on the perception that there are too
many different textbooks for one subject that teachers are
supposedly overwhelmed by the abundance of materials
offered and that publishers are exerting pressure on teachers
with aggressive marketing. These perceptions are mostly
unfounded or lacking in perspective. On average, there are
only three or four different textbooks for one subject and
they are revised infrequently. In neighboring Austria, for
example, there are usually more than 10 textbooks for one
subject, and this is not seen as a problem. Although these
ideas are not part of the Slovenian educational mainstream,
they seem to have some influence that can be seen in the
analyzed regulation, especially in the increased level of con-
trol from the regulation of 1996 to the current one.
Analyzing a History Textbook Parts
Furthermore, we will illustrate the violation of maxims by
analyzing a history textbook (Mirjani, Razpotnik, Snoj,
Verdev, & Zuljan, 2006) for eighth grade of elementary
school.
Example 1
Chapter:
The Reasons for the Rise of Liberal and
National Movements
Section:
Europeans Fought for Freedom and Their
Independent State
Ethnic groups that were subordinated to others [ethnicities,
nations op. auth] wished for a state in which they could live in
liberty and independence. Their gaining of independence was
long and difficult often accompanied by war. In the course of
independence struggles the masses often developed strong
emotions that led to the glorification of their own ethnicity and
belittling and oppression of others. This point of view is called
nationalism. Its consequence was the support for the
assimilation policies toward smaller ethnic groups and
minorities, that haven't won their own state jet. (Mirjani et al.,
2006, p. 103)
This example has several instances in which the maxim of
manner is violated. First, the maxims "be orderly" and also
"avoid the ambiguity of expression." Are we presented with
a kind of circular narrative where ethnic groups struggle for
independence, thereby developing nationalist prejudice
against other (presumably smaller?) ethnicities within them,
or are "nations" developing those notions toward ethnic
groups within their state, or perhaps both? It is not clear from
the text, who is the object or target of nationalist stance or
emotion; object in this case is defined solely by ethnicity, and
that is clearly ambiguous. The possibly circular explanation
is also not orderly as it proposes smaller and smaller divi-
sions within ethnicities perhaps ad absurdum to the situation
of one person's ethnicity.
What is even more important in this case is the violation
of the maxim of quantity as the contribution is not informa-
tive enough for the context in which it occurred. In contrast
to the explanation of other political stances, movements, ide-
ologies, or events, nationalism is not attributed to a named
movement, group, or individual but to the masses, whereby
this term is not only unclear but also degrading as "masses"
are usually regarded uncultured, uneducated, and
dangerous.
In this example, we see the attempt to strongly divide
national movements as positive political forces from nation-
alism as a negative phenomenon. This is done implicitly as
explicit division would be a falsehood both in terms of politi-
cal theory and historical fact. However, this division is in
accordance with the myth that the Slovenian independence
from Yugoslavia in the late 20th century was gained without
nationalist ideology or excesses, in contrast to, for example,
the Croatian independence war or Serbian expansionism.
Paradoxically, this contrast itself is a demonstration of a
nationalist stance. In this case, the application of Grice's
maxims is instrumental in uncovering hidden ideological
presuppositions in a history textbook.
Chapter: How the revolution changed France
Section:
Revolutionary orders of the national constitu-
ent assembly
The position of the Catholic church also changed:

church's properties were nationalized, profits from the sale
of estates was spent on the repayment of national debt,

civil weddings and divorces were put into law, thereby
enforcing the separation of church and state,

the borders of dioceses were rearranged in order to adhere to
the borders of French departments,
Klemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 7
 Priests were assigned a state salary and they had to swear an
oath of loyalty to the state.
The members of the national assembly were not against religion,
but by passing such laws they took away the privileges of the
church for the sake of the equality before law. (Mirjani et al.,
2006, p. 88)
Again this is an example of the violation of the maxims of
quantity and quality. To explain the position of Catholic
Church in post-revolutionary France, the bulleted text is
informative enough, especially if the relation between reli-
gion (church) and revolution is not to be further investigated.
It simply enumerates the changes in the church's position as
stated in the new constitution and laws. Still the authors
added another sentence whose validity cannot be easily sup-
ported. It is impossible to say whether all of the national
assembly members were not opposed to religion, and so this
statement cannot be proved and it constitutes the violation of
the maxim of quality.
What implication is uncovered by the analysis of this vio-
lation? It seems that what has to be negotiated is a positive
stance against both: the French revolution and the Catholic
Church. The fact that the revolution, in which contemporary
Western and also Slovenian democracy and citizen's rights
are rooted, brought harsh or even hostile sanctions toward
the religious institution to which most Slovenian citizens
belong seems to call for an explanation that, so to say, brings
both on the "same side of history." This happens in the con-
text of the recent process of Slovenian democratization, in
which the Catholic Church gained the status of the defender
of democracy and it tried to establish itself as a leading moral
force in the society. In this example, the fortifying of this
ideological position can be inferred.
This example can also be used, albeit this would require
further investigation, in examining the interpretation of
socialist revolution in Slovenia during and after World War II
(WWII). The fact is that the socialist revolutionary govern-
ment made laws similar to those of the French National
Assembly 150 years earlier: nationalization of property, sep-
aration of church and state accompanied in the first years
after WWII with sometimes violent persecutions. It is also
true that religion itself was explicitly criticized ("opium for
the people") by the governing communist party. However, it
is also true, for example, that the state paid for the health care
and social security of priests. Still one of the arguments in
denouncing socialism is its stance toward the church and
religion. When interpreting one revolution as positive and
another as negative, such similarities in revolutionary prac-
tices need to be explained in some way and the last sentence
of the example could be seen as an attempt at such implicit
explanation. We say implicit because no actual attempt at
comparing bourgeois and socialist revolution is made. The
point is that the last sentence of the example is a curious
contra factual addition to some factual information on French
revolution. As this is a textbook, where factuality is a (legal)
requirement, there certainly have to be very powerful rea-
sons to include a sentence that is in its present form impos-
sible to prove. And it seems that these powerful reasons lie
not in the French revolutionary but in the Slovenian contem-
porary history.
Conclusion
The analysis of written text, in our case texts in the field of
education--one example of legal regulation another text-
book excerpts--by applying the Grice's conversational max-
ims is a demonstration of one method of close reading by
which tacit presuppositions within the text can be identified.
Often these presuppositions are ideological in the sense that
they are generalist notions instrumental in interpreting the
social world. Schools are named ideological state appara-
tuses for precisely this reason--they provide mainstream
ideological interpretations through didactically transformed
scientific texts. What is even more unexpected is the ideol-
ogy accompanying the textbook market regulation.
In the first part of analysis, we analyzed the legal regula-
tion. For that, we chose the comparative approach to show
crucial changes in the period and also to demonstrate ideolo-
gies accompanying the textbook market regulation, both in
meaning and in reflecting the changes in textbook licensing
policy (using the analytical tool of Gricean maxims). The case
of two textbook licensing regulations that were enforced in
1996 and 2010 exemplifies this type of addition (in this case,
the addition is an overblown definition of the textbook) and its
implication. Regarding that which is crucial, this reflection
contains the violations of some Gricean maxims, which also
has some other implications for school knowledge. This seems
to be connected to one of the most problematic requirements,
being that "textbooks should allow for acquisition of different
levels or categories of knowledge." The regulation itself does
not provide or at least hint at the definition of any of those
terms. However, without explication, both can be understood
in a myriad of different ways, which de facto renders the
clause unusable for the purposes of the regulation itself,
namely providing relevant and, in the first place, equal criteria
for textbook assessment. This interpretation, which applies the
charity principle, presupposing that other principles use the
words in an ordinary way, has to give way to the interpretation
more in line of Grice's implicatures that there is a specific
meaning to these terms known to addressees of the regulation.
In this specific meaning, "levels" or "categories" of knowl-
edge pertain to Bloom's taxonomy of knowledge, which is
according to Justin (2008) heavily misused in Slovenian edu-
cational discourse. Another reason is that Bloom's taxonomy
(or any other attempt to categorize different types of learning
and the resultant knowledge) is a specific theoretical tool that
was not designed for the purpose of evaluating textbooks and
therefore such a specific framework should not be a constitu-
tive element of the regulation that defines the licensing of
8 SAGE Open
textbooks in general. The fact that the reference to Bloom is
not explicit constitutes the violation of Grice's maxim of man-
ner: avoid the obscurity of expression. Also other Gricean
maxims are often violated, namely the maxim of quantity (in
the definition of textbooks). The attempt at closely defining
the textbook indicates a certain misunderstanding of the gen-
eral concept of the "rule of law" in present day Slovenia. It is
often thought that most, if not every social and political issue,
should be solved by passing a law or regulation, written in a
detailed manner, that allows those affected by the law to fulfill
what is stated in it by simply putting checks for each pre-
scribed requirement. As the case of textbook definition shows,
many things in the social world cannot be easily defined in a
simple, taxonomically correct manner suitable to legal texts.
As we demonstrated, attempts at such definitions easily end in
a paradoxical mess.
In the second part of the analysis, we focused on illustrat-
ing the violation of maxims by analyzing a history textbook.
In the first example, we used the paragraph that describes the
point of view called nationalism. It is an example that has
several instances in which the maxim of manner is violated.
What is even more important in that case is the violation of
the maxim of quantity as the contribution is not informative
enough for the context in which it occurred. In addition, the
national myth from independence is also contained. The
application of Grice's maxims therefore uncovers hidden
ideological presuppositions in a history textbook. The next
example also shows the violation of the maxim of quantity
and quality in the area where the text explains the position of
the Catholic Church in post-revolutionary France, by adding
another sentence whose validity cannot be easily supported.
As the analysis revealed, the didactical transformation in the
case of textbook might bring about more than an explanation
and rewording of scientific text, itself prone to introducing
ideological content. Explicit additions were spotted in the
cases analyzed that are not based on the science transformed,
namely history. These additions seem to have a role of nego-
tiating between propositions of science and (national or
nation making) myths that obviously have to be preserved.
The case of two textbook licensing regulations that were
enforced in 1996 and 2010 also exemplifies this type of addi-
tion (in this case, the addition is an overblown definition of
the textbook) and its implication.

Notes
 1. Grice's theory of cooperative principle and its maxims have been
applied in textbook analysis before (Cepic and Vogrincic, 2003).
2. In the continuation of Chapter 2 (named Maxims), we will
use Grice's definitions with quotations (Grice, 1989/1991,
pp. 26-29).
 3. This situation is relatively recent in Slovenia; until the 1990s,
there was a single prescribed textbook for each subject in both
primary and secondary schools.
4. To illustrate the extent of textbook approval mechanisms,
we looked at several examples: In Austria, the textbooks are
approved by the Ministry of Education and Women--a simple
description is to be found on the page of the Veritas publisher
(http://www.veritas.at/about/schulbuch#einreichung). In the
neighboring German state of Bavaria (as an example), the reg-
ulation is similar (the regulation on the textbook approval is at
http://www.gesetze-bayern.de/jportal/portal/page/bsbayprod.p-
sml?showdoccase=1&st=lr&doc.id=jlr-LernMZulVBY-
2009rah-men&doc.part=X&doc.origin=bs. For a current
discussion on the situation in the United States focusing on
Texas curriculum and textbook adoption system, see Erekson
et al. (2012).
5. From the Pravilnik o upravljanju ucbeniskih skladov [Rules
on Management of textbook Funds], Uradni list Republike
Slovenije [Official Journal of the Republic of Slovenia],
43/2002, amendments in Journal 65/2007. The paragraph is
based on the School book fund regulation, which was valid
from 1994 to 2010. In 2010 (Journal 37/2010), the regula-
tion was amended allowing the funds to replace the textbooks
only after the license for the respective textbook expires. As
the licenses are renewed routinely, this means that teachers
will not be able to change the textbooks for quite some time.
The amendment provoked vocal protest from publishers. The
Ministry of Education, it seems, made these changes because
of pending curricular renewal, trying to prevent the purchase
of books that will be used only for a year. It is expected that the
regulation will be changed again.
 6. The description is based on the current regulation from 2011.
The regulation is renewed relatively frequently every 2 or 3
years. Some of the changes were fairly substantial (i.e., until
2006 publishers only had to present five typical--set--pages
and a manuscript with the description of illustrations).
 7. Rules on approving textbooks, Official Journal of the Republic
of Slovenia, issue 57/2006, amendments issues 45/2010 and
52/2011.
 8. Despite that we must be aware that the authors of textbooks
have their own vision of contents and teaching methods,
which should lead to a higher level of scientific thinking and
that the textbook alone is not a guarantee for expected results
(Ahtineva, 2005).
 9. In 2010, the Ministry of Education issued the amendment to
the regulation of 2006. For this purpose, the amendments of
2010 are collated in 2006 version. The changes pertaining to
cited paragraphs concern the electronic versions of textbooks.
10. "Reader" in the context of Slovenian primary school is a col-
lection of (canonical) literary texts of Slovenian and world
literature.
11. We should still be careful about identifying Bloom's taxonomy
in the analyzed text. This decision is based on the numerous
references to Bloom in a wide variety of texts on Slovenian
educational system. Still as a backup, we will develop a cri-
tique of this clause in the regulation in the manner of reductio
ad absurdum, showing that the clause is obsolete. The reason-
ing is that no text exists that would allow the acquisition of a
Klemencic and Cepic Vogrincic 9
single level or category of knowledge. On the lowest level,
there are words with their dictionary meanings as a type of
knowledge to be acquired. Words combined are an example
of another level of knowledge. Therefore, there is no text that
does not have the property that defines a textbook, from which
it follows that the property (different levels and categories of
knowledge) is useless in defining a textbook. This reasoning
uses an arbitrary and a common sense conception of levels
of knowledge, but even if using Bloom's taxonomy, one can
prove that there is no text in which only a single category
could be identified.
