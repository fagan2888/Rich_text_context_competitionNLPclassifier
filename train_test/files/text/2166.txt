Object: To assess whether younger siblings of partici-
pants in an early (preschool) educational program would
benefit in terms of developmental and educational out-
comes.
Design: Assessment of a cohort of siblings of interven-
tion participants at a mean age of 13.5 years.
Setting: The Infant Health and Development Program
(IHDP), an 8-site randomized trial of 3 years of early edu-
cation for premature low-birth-weight infants who were
followed up through 18 years of age.
Participants: Siblings born within 5 years of the IHDP
study participants.
Main Exposure: A sibling born no more than 5 years
earlier who participated in the IHDP.
Main Outcome Measures: Observed IQ; youth re-
port of behavioral problems, their expectations of future
success, and their relationship with their parents; and the
caregiver's report on the youth's school progress and their
expectations of the youth's educational attainment.
Results: Of 878 IHDP participants who were followed
up, 466 (53.1%) had an eligible younger sibling, and 229
of those siblings (49.1%) agreed to participate. No dif-
ferences were seen between the siblings of those who did
and did not receive the IHDP intervention on any of the
outcome measures. Adjusting for maternal race/
ethnicity, age, and educational attainment at the birth of
the study participant; study site; sex of the sibling; and
losses to the cohort did not alter the results.
Conclusion: Participation in an early educational pro-
gram confers no apparent benefit on younger siblings in
their early adolescent years.

efits with respect to economic productiv-
ity, higher education, and less criminal be-

randomized trials of intensive center-
based education, but comparable results
have occurred in one home-visiting pro-
gram8 and a quasi experiment that used
center care and a parenting intervention
at several sites in one city.9,10 Although
moststudiesinvolvedisadvantagedgroups,
these findings have been extended in a
study involving a population heteroge-
neous for socioeconomic status and po-
tential neurodevelopmental disability in
the Infant Health and Development Pro-
gram (IHDP).11 The results support the ar-
gument that early educational interven-
tion in high-risk preschool children
conveys substantial benefits outweighing
the initial investment.3,5,12
Cost-benefit discussions have focused
on direct benefits to the children who re-
ceived the intervention3,5 or to their moth-
ers, also considered targets of interven-
tion strategies.12 However, many of these
interventions, such as IHDP11 and its an-
tecedent Abecedarian Project,6,7 include
components designed to provide specific
information and modeling of behavior for
fostering children's cognitive and behav-
ioral development that might influence the
care of younger children.13

The evidence for such spillover effects is limited, how-
ever.Studiesoffamily-basedinterventionsforchildrenwith
or at risk of significant behavioral disorders have noted im-
proved behavior in older and younger nontargeted sib-
lings.14 GrayandKlaus14 reportedhigherIQsamongyounger
siblings closest in age to those who participated in the Early
Training Project, a randomized trial of a preschool early-
educational intervention. Garces et al15 noted small posi-
tive, insignificant effects on educational attainment of the
younger siblings of Head Start participants but a signifi-
cant reduction of 11% in the risk of being charged with a
crimeamongtheyoungersiblingsofAfricanAmericanpar-
ticipants.Ifsucheffectswereseenmorebroadly,theywould
provide additional justification for early childhood educa-
tional programs, especially those with a parenting compo-
nent. To address this issue, we examined outcomes for
younger siblings born after the intervention child in IHDP
by obtaining interviews and developmental observations
during the age 18­year follow-up of the IHDP sample.11
METHODS
STUDY SAMPLE
The IHDP was a multisite randomized controlled trial of an edu-
cational intervention until 3 years of age for low-birth-weight pre-
term infants at 8 sites. Infants were sampled from 2 birth-weight
strata(2000g[lighterlow-birth-weight(LLBW)groupand2001-
2499 g [heavier low-birth-weight (HLBW) group]) to ensure an
oversample of those at higher developmental risk (LLBW group)
and continuity with studies of poor, normal-birth-weight chil-
dren(HLBWgroup).Randomassignmenttothearmsofthestudy
resulted in balance by sociodemographic and health variables
known to affect child development (see the "Baseline Variables"
subsection). The intervention (INT) consisted of home visits
weekly for the first year and every other week in the second and
third years and daily center-based education beginning at 12
months and continuing until 36 months of age (both corrected
for duration of gestation). At all sites, both components fol-
lowed structured protocols and a common curriculum designed
to enhance parental abilities to anticipate and foster child devel-
opment and to address other issues affecting parents' lives.16-18 All
children received intensive pediatric follow-up care, which for
the other arm of the study was the only service provided (fol-
low-up only [FUO]). The program and its results have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere.13,19-22 In summary, at the end of the
intervention period (3 years of age), all participants in the INT
group averaged higher IQ and lower behavioral problem scores
than those in the FUO group.19 In addition, measures of the home
environment and parenting behaviors favored the INT group.23,24
At subsequent ages, no differences in IQ, achievement testing, or
behavior were seen for the LLBW children. In the HLBW group,
the INT group had persistently higher IQ scores compared with
the FUO group, but the differences were smaller than at the end
of the intervention. In addition, the HLBW group had higher
achievement scores and exhibited less risky behavior.11,20,21 Sub-
sequent childbearing among the IHDP mothers was equivalent
in both arms of the study at the 36-month assessment.25
As part of the preparation for the assessment at 18 years of
age, personnel at the study sites were asked to identify younger
siblings born within 5 years of the study child based on records
held at the study sites from the follow-up at 8 years of age. Five
yearswasselectedtoidentifyyoungerchildrenbornrelativelysoon
after the IHDP child who might benefit from the parent-focused
components of the intervention and likely not to be the product
of new family formation. In instances of multiple eligible sib-
lings, we selected the sibling closest in age to the IHDP child of
the same biological mother. Twin siblings of the IHDP child were
not eligible for assessment because they participated in the INT
phase according to a prespecified protocol.13
ASSESSMENT AND OUTCOME VARIABLES
The assessment of younger siblings included psychological ob-
servations and interviews with the sibling and primary care-
giver. Cognitive performance was assessed using the Wechs-
ler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence.26 The Wechsler scale
provides IQ information and includes total, verbal, and per-
formance IQ scores referenced to a mean (SD) of 100 (15).
Theyouthwereaskedtoreportontheirownbehavior,expec-
tations of future success, and relationship with the primary care-
giver. The first relied on the Behavior Problem Index,27 28 items

with higher values indicative of worse behavior. Future expecta-
tionswereascertainedusing9questionsselectedfromapreviously

paying job, a happy family life, friends, and good health.28 Each
item was answered along a 5-point Likert scale from very low to
very high likelihood, with higher scores indicating higher expec-
tationsofsuccess.Finally,theyouthwereasked12itemsfromthe

ment in Chicago Neighborhoods.30 Items were selected to reflect

times in the past year; items were scored as written if reported as
singledigitsorinthemiddleofthosereportedasranges.31 Thescores
ranged from 0 to 231, with a mean (SD) of 64.1 (44.2).
Primary caregivers provided information on attendance at
school, grade and school difficulties (classification for special
education or repetition of a grade), and expectations for how
far they thought the sibling would go in school. They also pro-
vided the sibling's birth weight and sex.
BASELINE VARIABLES
A standard set of variables obtained at the beginning of the study
before randomization was used to compare participants and non-
participants in this assessment and to adjust the outcomes for
differences across sites. These included maternal age in years
at the time of the birth of the IHDP participant; maternal race/
ethnicity (African American, Hispanic, and white/other as self-
declared by the mother at the time of recruitment into the study);
maternal educational attainment at the time of the birth of the
IHDP participant (high school graduate, high school gradu-
ate, and high school graduate); and study site: Arkansas (Little
Rock), Einstein (South Bronx, New York), Harvard (Boston,
Massachusetts), Miami (Miami, Florida), Pennsylvania (Phila-
delphia), Texas (Dallas), Washington (Seattle), and Yale (New
Haven, Connecticut). In addition, they included the birth weight
stratum (LLBW or HLBW) and the arm of the study of the IHDP
participant (INT or FUO).
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Distributions by the baseline variables were used to compare
study participants at 18 years of age with and without younger
siblings and to compare younger siblings who did and did not
participate (ie, completed an interview and/or psychological as-
sessment). Comparisons of scores on IQ tests, the Behavior Prob-
lem Index, future expectations, and the Conflict Tactics Scale

relied on mean differences and 95% CIs; for categorical vari-
ables, odds ratios and 95% CIs were calculated. As done pre-
viously,11 the effect of the losses to the cohorts on the out-
comes was assessed using separate linear (analysis of covariance)
models for each outcome variable derived from the S-plus soft-
ware.32 These models controlled for the baseline variables mea-
sured at enrollment to estimate the differences between INT
and FUO groups. The linear models provided population mar-
ginal mean values and differences (INT vs FUO) for each out-
come by substituting into the linear model the average values
of the covariates. Nominal P values derived from the linear mod-
els were used for primary outcome comparisons. Under the mod-
eling assumptions, this method removes nonresponse bias.
HUMAN SUBJECTS
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of
all participating institutions. A certification of confidentiality
was also obtained. Written informed consent was obtained from
the caregivers for the assessment of the siblings and written as-
sent from the younger sibling.
RESULTS
Of the original 978 infants enrolled in the analysis group
of IHDP, 878 were eligible for follow-up by virtue of not
having died or refused previous assessments by age 8 years.
Of these, 466 (53.1%) had a potentially eligible younger
sibling born within 5 years. As seen in Table 1, IHDP
participants with and without younger siblings did not
differ on any of the baseline variables except study site
and maternal age. Participants at the Einstein and Yale
sites were slightly less likely to have a younger sibling,
whereas those in Miami and Seattle were more likely.
Mothers who were younger on enrollment into the
study were more likely to have a child after the IHDP
participant.
Of the 466 younger siblings identified, 229 (49.1%)
agreed to be interviewed and assessed. As seen in Table 2,
no differences between those completing and not com-
pleting the assessment were seen for the baseline vari-

ticipants at Harvard, Texas, and Washington were less
likely to complete an assessment, and those in Arkan-
sas, Miami, and Pennsylvania were more likely to do so.
In particular, no difference in sibling completion rates
was seen with respect to study arm. The resulting sample
was predominantly of minority race/ethnicity, with a siz-
able proportion of mothers having an educational attain-
ment less than high school graduation.

those in the FUO group in terms of IQ, self-reported be-

rental disciplinary strategies, or caregiver reports on their
current and anticipated educational progress. When analy-
ses were restricted to groups who benefited the most from
IHDP (the HLBW group11 and study participants whose
mothers had a high school education or less33), again no
differences were seen.

These results are somewhat unexpected given that
IHDP provided explicit approaches to enhancing paren-
tal abilities to address problems and improve coping
skills13,16 and relied on a developmentally oriented cur-
riculum17,18 with play materials. As predicted, the home
environments and parenting skills were rated as more
likely to be associated with better child develop-
ment.23,24 Despite these positive changes at 36 months
favoring the intervention, no long-term changes were seen.
One explanation for the lack of sibling effect is that
the parenting components of early childhood education
programs may contribute to the differences shortly after
the intervention period but not account for a significant
portion of the sustained effects seen in some programs,
which may directly influence the child.2,3,34 This hypoth-
esis has been experimentally tested in only 1 evaluation
comparing a strategy of home visits only in which most
of the intervention would be through the parents, with
a strategy of home visits plus high-quality early child-
hood education and using the curriculum from which
the IHDP program was developed.35 In comparison with
the control participants, significant differences in child
outcomes were seen with the strategy of home visits plus
high-quality early childhood education but not with the
home-visits-only program. Other suggestive evidence is
derived from observations that effect sizes for parenting
outcomes across numerous studies are smaller than those
for child outcomes,36,37 including the lack of overall dif-
ferences in maternal outcomes by study arm in IHDP at
age 18 years.38
Several factors may account for the lack of a sibling ef-
fect in IHDP compared with other studies and include the
sociodemographic characteristics of participating fami-
lies, the nature of the parental tasks for supporting devel-
opment, and changes or differences in families who re-
ceivedearlyinterventionprograms.TheIHDPisnotastudy
solely of disadvantaged families, and many of our partici-
pants would have had the resources to support the devel-
opment of their children as suggested by the lack of effect
in the original trial in more advantaged sites or fami-
lies19,33 andbythehigherIQsamongtheIHDPsiblingscom-
pared with those for the siblings in the Early Training Pro-
gram (85).14 We continued to see no difference when
the analyses were restricted to less-educated mothers, but
the power for this analysis was limited.
Where sibling effects have been observed more fre-
quently are studies of serious behavioral problems.39-41
Providing parents with standard ways of fostering posi-
tive behaviors and extinguishing negative ones may be
more generally applicable across children than the ob-
servation and tailoring of developmental tasks used in
IHDP.17,18 Moreover, in some studies, the siblings were
clearly involved in the intervention.39,40 Finally, many of
these studies relied on parental report of behavioral prob-
lems as the outcome, with the suggestion that the inter-
vention may not diminish the behavioral problems but
rather the parental distress in response to them.41
Where sibling effects have been seen in developmen-
tal studies, they occur in the context of profound changes
in the families with greater maternal educational attain-
ment,limitationsinfamilysize,andgreatereconomicwell-
being.42 Alternatively, families may differ at baseline, such
as those who seek out educational opportunities for their
children (as in Head Start) in unknown ways that would
lead to better developmental and school outcomes,43 thus
accounting for better outcomes among younger sib-
lings. In IHDP, the 2 study arms were carefully bal-
anced for significant predictors of child outcomes13,19; dif-
fered very little in maternal workforce participation,
further maternal educational attainment, or subsequent
childbearing at the end of the intervention phase25; and
showed no long-term differences in a variety of mater-
nal attitudes or behaviors at 18 years of age.38 Thus, our
results differ from studies of disadvantaged populations
in an earlier era.12,44
Our results should be considered in the light of some
of the limitations of the study. One limitation is the lack
of early childhood data on the younger siblings. We did
not, for example, have information on birth or early health
events that might affect school performance and later out-
comes or on the child care arrangements and early educa-
tional experiences of these youth. In addition, although we
attempted to account statistically for siblings not as-
sessed, cohort attrition may have affected the results. Like-
wise, the youth were still in school; therefore, we were un-
able to assess their long-term outcomes, such as school
completion and criminal behavior, which is in contrast to
the study by Garces et al,15 who reported differences.
Despite these limitations, this study adds to the lit-
erature on the effects of early childhood education. In
particular, it raises questions about the potential for ef-
fects other than those seen among the primary targets of
an educational intervention.
