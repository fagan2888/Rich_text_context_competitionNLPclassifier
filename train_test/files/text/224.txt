of Its Effects on Quality of Care and the Doctor-
Patient Relationship

Background: The objective of the study was to determine physicians' views of the effects of Direct-to-
Consumer Advertising (DTCA) on health service utilization, quality of care, and the doctor-
patient relationship.
Methods: Cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of US physicians to determine
their perceptions of the effects of patients discussing information from DTCA on time efficiency; re-
quests for specific interventions; health outcomes; and the doctor-patient relationship.
Results: Physicians reported that more than half (56%) of patients who discussed information from
DTCA in a visit did so because they wanted a specific intervention, such as a test, change in medication,
or specialist referral. The physician deemed 49% of these requests clinically inappropriate. Physicians
filled 69% of requests they deemed clinically inappropriate; 39% of physicians perceived DTCA as dam-
aging to the time efficiency of the visit, and 13% saw it as helpful. Thirty-three percent of physicians
thought discussing DTCA had improved the doctor-patient relationship; 8% felt it had worsened it. The
effect on the relationship was strongly associated with doing what the patient wanted.
Conclusions: DTCA can have good and bad effects on quality of care, the doctor-patient relationship,
and health service utilization. The benefits might be maximized, and the harms minimized, by increas-
ing the accuracy of information in advertisements; enhancing physicians' communication and negotia-
tion skills; and encouraging patients to respect physicians' clinical expertise. (J Am Board Fam Pract

Compared with other sources of health informa-
tion for the public, direct-to-consumer advertising
of prescription medications (DTCA) is pervasive,
persuasive, and passive. Patients are exposed to
DTCA without actively seeking it. Unlike much
public interest advertising,1 it uses effective tech-
niques, including a strong emotional appeal to tar-
geted audiences.2 The pharmaceutical industry
spends more than $2 billion annually with the goal
of promoting consumer desire for products and
hence increasing market share.3
Its advantages and disadvantages are controver-
sial.3,4 Proponents contend that DTCA provides
valuable health information5 that helps patients
voice health concerns to their physician and in-
creases patients' sense of confidence and control
during visits.6 Both these effects could improve the
doctor-patient relationship. DTCA may also raise
awareness of underdiagnosed, treatable conditions
such as hyperlipidemia or depression, leading to
physician visits for prevention and treatment that
would not otherwise occur.7 Opponents argue that
DTCA contributes to rising drug costs,8 encour-
ages inappropriate prescribing,9­11 and may in-
crease overall health care costs needlessly by lead-
ing to requests for tests or referrals that are not
clinically indicated. Evidence for these conflicting
claims is scanty. Available data are limited by small
samples or restricted populations.9,12 This is the
first population based survey of physicians, and the

first to look at physician views on the impact of
DTCA on the doctor-patient relationship and the
quality of care. Moreover, it is unknown whether
the effects of DTCA vary according to socioeco-
nomic or health status, which is important in view
of the widespread concern about health disparities.
We used data from 2 nationally representative
surveys of US physicians and the US public on
DTCA to examine these claims, and to determine
the extent to which the effects of DTCA vary with
socio-economic and health status. This article uses
data from the physician survey to address the ef-
fects of DTCA on quality of care, health outcomes,
health service utilization, and physicians' percep-
tions of its effect on the doctor-patient relation-
ship. Our forthcoming article uses the public data
set to analyze issues pertaining to the individual and
to population health.
Methods
Development of Testable Hypotheses
Our first step was to collate published claims and
derive hypotheses that could be tested in at least 1
of our 2 data sets (Figure 1). Not all the claimed
benefits or harms of DTCA were amenable to ex-
amination with the available data (e.g., "DTCA
contributes to a cultural expectation of a `pill for
every ill.'"13,14
Sample
Two thousand physicians were randomly selected
from the national list of physicians provided by
the Medical Marketing Service, Inc. (MMS). The
MMS list is based on the national database of the
American Medical Association (AMA), which con-
tains more than 650,000 physicians, and is the most
complete list of physicians available in the US.
Physicians who currently spent more than 20 hours
a week on direct patient care were included in the
survey. The sample was stratified by specialty: pri-
mary care, medical specialty, or surgical specialty.
Primary care included Family Practice, General
Practice, Internal Medicine, and Pediatrics. Ob-
Gyn was classified as a surgical specialty.
Questionnaire
The questionnaire was developed after literature
review and focus group discussions and was pre-
tested. It consisted of 3 sections of closed-ended
questions and took approximately 12 minutes to
complete. The entire sample received Part 1 of the
questionnaire, which elicited general information
about views on health information on the Internet
and DTCA. Questions examined general views on
accuracy and effects of such information, and per-
sonal use of the Internet at work. Part 2 was sent to
a random 50% of the sample. It asked whether any
patient had discussed information derived from
DTCA in the past 12 months and, if so, specific
inquiries were made about the last time this hap-
pened. "Last time" methodology was used to min-
imize recall bias. Areas explored were the relevance
and accuracy of the information, physicians' per-
ceptions of why the patient had brought the infor-
mation, physicians' responses to the patient, and
their views about the impact on health care, health
outcomes, and the doctor-patient relationship. The
other 50% of the sample received a different Part 2,
which asked about respondents' experiences with
Internet information. Part 3 was received by the
entire sample and obtained demographic and work-
load information: hours per week spent on face-to-
face consultations, other tasks related to patient
care, and administrative tasks; numbers of patients
seen per week; practice income; proportions of pa-
tients on Medicaid, from minority groups, having
household incomes of less than $20,000 per annum,
and with no health insurance; geographic setting of
practice; age and racial origin of respondent. This
was supplemented with information from the
MMS database, including specialty, year of gradu-
ation from medical school, geographic region
(East, South, Midwest, West), whether hospital or
office-based, and whether trained in the United
States or overseas.
Response Rate
Data collection was undertaken between Novem-
ber 2000 and February 2001. The questionnaire
was mailed to the selected physicians with a check
for $35 as a token of appreciation for completing
the questionnaire. Up to 3 reminders were sent and
additional telephone contact made with non-
responders. Of the original 2000 physicians sent
the survey, 38 were ineligible because they were
deceased, retired, or no longer in practice; 1050
physicians completed the questionnaire (response
rate 53%). Of these, 535 received the DTCA ver-
sion of the questionnaire and 515 the Internet ver-
sion (Figure 2).

Analysis
Weighting
Data were weighted to represent the national pop-
ulation of physicians on the MMS database who
spend 20 or more hours per week on direct patient
care using the MMS variables mentioned above.
Outcome Variables
The effect of DTCA on the doctor-patient rela-
tionship was tested using physician perceptions of
the relationship and whether the doctor had felt
that the patient was challenging his or her authority
during the discussion. Outcomes pertaining to the

effect of DTCA on health service utilization were:
physicians' perceptions of the effect of DTCA on
the time efficiency of the visit; the proportion of
patients who made requests for specific interven-
tions as a result of DTCA; the proportion of these
requests that the doctor deemed clinically inappro-
priate; the proportion of appropriate and inappro-
priate requests filled by the physician; and physi-
cians' perceptions of the effects of DTCA on
quality of care and ultimate health outcomes.
Independent Variables
We used 4 categories of independent variables: prac-
tice demographics (as a proxy for patient socioeco-
nomic status); pre-existing physician views about
DTCA; physician's emotional and cognitive re-
sponses to the last time a patient brought information
from a DTCA to a visit (whether they perceived the
patient as taking responsibility for his/her health or
challenging the doctor's professional authority, why
the patient discussed the information with them,
whether any requests made by the patient were clin-
ically appropriate, whether the request(s) was filled,
whether there was enough time to discuss the infor-
mation, and whether they knew the patient well
enough to have good communication); and physi-
cians' perceptions of the accuracy and relevance of the
information in the advertisement discussed.

Univariate relationships were calculated using
the 2 statistic or Fischer exact test as appropriate.
In the absence of a priori hypotheses, multivariate
relationships were determined by entering corre-
lates with univariate relationships (P  .20) into a
stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify the
"most important" correlates, where importance is
defined solely by statistical criteria. Each analysis
went through several iterations, with each new it-
eration using successively more stringent statistical
criteria for inclusion in the model. Each iteration
included consideration of a model yielded by a
forward stepwise procedure and a model yielded by
a backward stepwise procedure. The goal was to
identify the most parsimonious model while still
achieving adequate fit, which was operationalized
as P  .20 on the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-
of-fit test.
Because all data were weighted (except where
specified), the appropriate procedures to correct
p-values and standard errors were undertaken. We
used the SVYTAB procedure in STATA to obtain
the Rao and Scott F test p-values15 and the SVY-
LOGIT procedure in STATA to obtain corrected
standard errors for parameter estimates.
Results
Characteristics and Representativeness
of the Sample
The characteristics of the respondents before and
after weighting are presented in Table 1. Weight-
ing made only minimal difference, confirming that
respondents were representative of the national
population of physicians. From this point on, all
data presented are weighted.
General Views of DTCA
Positive and Negative Effects of DTCA
Of all respondents (n  1050), more than half had
a negative response to the recent increase in adver-
tising prescription drugs directly to consumers:
52% [95% confidence interval (CI), 49 to 55%]
thought it was bad or very bad, 17% (95% CI, 15 to
19%) were neutral, and only 31% (95% CI, 28 to
34%) thought it was good or very good. Despite
this, most doctors agreed that DTCA gives patients
confidence to talk to their doctors about health
concerns and encourages patients to follow the
doctor's instructions or advice (Table 2). No de-
mographic, practice, or workload variables were
associated with respondents overall opinion about
DTCA.
Accuracy and Relevance of DTCA
Eight percent (95% CI, 7 to 10%) of respondents
thought that advertisements were very accurate,
67% (95% CI, 64 to 69%) thought they were
somewhat accurate, and the remainder thought
they were not very or not at all accurate. Most
physicians thought that their patients were not
good at assessing whether the information in a drug
advertisement was personally relevant: only 4%
(95% CI, 3 to 6%) thought their patients were
excellent or very good at this, 18% (95% CI, 15 to
21%) thought they were good at it, 54% (95% CI,
51 to 58%) thought their patients were fair, and
24% (95% CI, 21 to 27%) thought they were poor
at this.
Experience with Patients Bringing Information
from DTCA to a Physician Visit
Respondents were asked about the last time a pa-
tient talked about information from a drug adver-
tisement during a visit. 80% (n  395; Figure 2)
had experienced this in the previous 12 months.
Data in the remainder of this article refers to those
395 physicians. Of these, 51% reported that less
than 20% of their patients had talked about infor-
mation from a drug ad during a visit, and a further
35% stated that between 21 and 40% of their pa-
tients had done this.

Effect on Doctor-Patient Relationship
General Impact
More physicians believed that patients talking
about information from a drug advertisement had a
positive effect (33%; 95% CI, 28 to 38%) than a
negative effect (7%; 95% CI, 5 to 11%) on the
doctor-patient relationship. On univariate analysis,
an improved relationship was associated with phy-
sicians' perceptions that the information in the ad-
vertisement was relevant and accurate, the patient
seeking only the doctor's opinion rather than a
specific intervention, and the doctor's responses
during the discussion (Table 3). Specifically, the
doctor doing what the patient wanted, feeling that
the patient was taking responsibility for his or her
health, and perceiving the request as clinically in-
dicated were all associated with an improved
relationship. Conversely, inaccurate, irrelevant in-
formation was associated with a deterioration in the
relationship, as was the doctor feeling that the pa-
tient was challenging his or her authority, not hav-
ing enough time to discuss the request, and not
doing what the patient wanted. Practice character-
istics were not associated with a positive or negative

impact on the doctor-patient relationship. On mul-
tivariate analysis, the most important factor inde-
pendently associated with an improved doctor-
patient relationship was the doctor doing what the
patient wanted (Table 3).
Doctors Who Feel Challenged
Twelve percent (95% CI, 10 to 16%) of doctors felt
that their authority was being challenged by the
patient during the discussion about DTCA (Table
4). On univariate analysis, doctors were more likely
to feel challenged if the patient wanted a specific
intervention, if the intervention was not clinically
indicated, if the doctor did not do what the patient
wanted, or if the doctor did not know the patient
well enough to have good communication (Table
4). Multivariate analysis confirmed that these re-
sponses by the doctor, rather than practice charac-

teristics, were independently associated with feel-
ing challenged (Table 4).
Effect on Quality of Care, Health Outcomes, and
Health Service Utilization
Patients' Reasons for Talking about DTCA During a Visit
In 56% (95% CI, 51 to 61%; n  222) of the visits
in which patients talked about DTCA, the doctor
perceived the patient's reason for doing this as
wanting at least 1 specific intervention, such as a
test (n  110; 28%), change in medication (n 
190; 48%), or referral (n  54; 14%). In the re-
maining cases, the doctor perceived the patient as
only wanting the doctor's opinion.
Physician's Response
Of the 222 cases in which the patient made a
request, doctors deemed the request inappropriate
for the patient's health in 108 cases (Figure 3). In
75 of these cases (19% of all visits in which DTCA
was discussed; 69% of inappropriate requests), the
doctor did what the patient wanted, either com-
pletely (n  5) or partially (n  70). In 33 cases, the
doctor did not do what the patient wanted at all.
Effect on Time-Efficiency
More physicians viewed discussing information
from a drug advertisement as worsening the time
efficiency of the visit (39%; 95% CI, 34 to 44%)
than helping it (13%; 95% CI, 10 to 17%). On
univariate analysis, factors associated with wors-
ened time efficiency included inaccurate or irrele-
vant advertisements, patients wanting a specific in-
tervention, and the doctor's response. Not doing
what the patient wanted was strongly associated
with worsened time efficiency, as was thinking that
the request was not appropriate or that the patient
was challenging the doctor's authority (Table 5).
On multivariate analysis, inaccurate ads, specific
requests, inappropriate requests, and the doctor's
feeling challenged were independently associated
with worsened time efficiency (Table 5).
Effect on Quality of Care
We further analyzed the 75 cases in which the
patient had made a request that was deemed inap-
propriate by the physician (Figure 3). In the 5 cases
in which the physician did what the patient wanted
completely, the impact of this on quality of care was
viewed as neutral. In the 69 cases in which the
doctor had done partially what the patient re-
quested, the effect on quality of care was viewed as
positive in 15 cases (22%), neutral in 50 cases
(73%), and harmful in 4 cases (6%).
When the patient's request was deemed appro-
priate by the doctor, the effect of doing what the
patient wanted, either completely or partially, was
viewed as positive or neutral in all cases. The find-
ings were similar for effect on ultimate health out-
comes (data not shown).
On multivariate analysis, several factors were
independently associated with the patient making a
request for an intervention that the doctor deemed
inappropriate: the physician regarding the adver-
tisement as not very or not at all accurate [odds
ratio (OR) 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.5]; the physician
regarding patients as poor (rather than fair to ex-
cellent) at assessing the relevance of a drug ad (OR
2.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.2), and the physician feeling
that he or she did not know the patient well enough
to have good communication (OR 5.4; 95% CI, 1.1
to 26.2).
Discussion
We found that DTCA has complex effects on qual-
ity of care and health service utilization. DTCA
results in patients making almost as many inappro-
priate requests as appropriate ones. This puts phy-
sicians in a quandary, facing 3 conflicting ethical
obligations. First, physicians aim to "do no harm."
Second, physicians seek to maintain and develop
a strong doctor-patient relationship because it
enhances future care and health outcomes. In
addition, patient satisfaction is now used as a
benchmark for quality of care and, as such, may
determine physician income. Third, physicians
have a duty to ensure fair allocation of health care
resources and avoid wasteful expenditure. In the
United States, such stewardship of societal re-
sources is regarded as a weaker obligation than
promoting the well-being of the individual pa-
tient.16­18 We found that physicians find respond-
ing to inappropriate requests time-consuming and
that they often seem to acquiesce to such requests
as long as the patient is not harmed. Thus, physi-
cians attempt to mitigate negative effects of DTCA
but at the cost of physician time or health care
dollars. Furthermore, more doctors perceive the
effect on the relationship as beneficial than harm-
ful, but this is dependent on physicians doing what
the patient wants, a finding confirmed in our forth-
coming article presenting patients' views.
Direct-to-Consumer Advertising 521
Our findings have several implications for max-
imizing the benefits of DTCA while minimizing
the harms. Inaccurate DTCA increases costs with-
out improving health outcomes. Increased regula-
tion of DTCA may ensure that information in
advertisements is accurate and includes possible
harms of treatment, as well as nonpharmacological
alternatives.
Figure 3. Outcomes when patients brought information from DTCA to a visit (n  395).
522 JABFP November­December 2003 Vol. 16 No. 6
In addition, patients need stronger skills in crit-
ically appraising drug advertisements to determine
whether the material is personally relevant and ac-
curate. Patients should seek the physician's opinion
on the relevance and accuracy of information in
DTCA. This would both strengthen the doctor-
patient relationship and avoid clinically inappropri-
ate interventions. Just as physicians need to ac-
knowledge that patients are expert in knowing their
own health utilities, patients need to recognize
physician clinical judgment.
Finally, physicians need to learn how to negoti-
ate inappropriate requests efficiently without jeop-

that patients are challenging their authority. En-
hanced communication skills may enable doctors to
follow their professional judgment, without dam-
aging the doctor-patient relationship.19
Methodological Issues
Several methodological issues limit the generaliz-
ability of our findings. First, this article reports on
a secondary analysis of an extant data set, so not all
hypotheses could be evaluated with the desired
precision. Second, we have no objective measures
of the appropriateness of patient requests; however,
because this is a professional judgment of the type
clinicians make daily, respondents' opinions have a
degree of face validity. Finally, the response rate is
moderate at 53%, despite every effort to maximize
it. However, comparison of unweighted with
weighted data suggests that the sample obtained
was representative of US physicians, and sampling
weights were applied to adjust for survey nonre-
sponse.
Conclusions
DTCA can have both good and bad effects on the
doctor-patient relationship and health service uti-
lization. The benefits can be maximized and the
harms minimized by increasing the accuracy and
relevance of the information in the advertisements,
enhancing physicians' communication and negoti-
ation skills, and encouraging patients to respect
physicians' clinical expertise.
We are grateful to Kinga Zapert and Rachel Turner of Harris

ment and to Joseph Catania, PhD, director of the Health Survey
Research Unit, for advice on the analytical strategy.
