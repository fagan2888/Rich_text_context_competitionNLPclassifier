Sexual Activity Among Adolescents
in Romantic Relationships With Friends,
Acquaintances, or Strangers
Christine E. Kaestle, MSPH; Carolyn Tucker Halpern, PhD
Objective: To explore the influence of preexisting so-
cial ties between romantic partners (ie, knowing the part-
ner as a friend or acquaintance before a relationship was
considered "romantic" by the adolescent) on sexual risk
behaviors among adolescents.
Design, Setting, and Participants: By using data from
6658 adolescents from Wave II of the National Longitu-
dinal Study of Adolescent Health, we examined associa-
tions between preromantic social ties between partners
and several sexual risk behaviors using logistic regres-
sion analyses.
Main Outcome Measures: Whether the couple had
intercourse, and if they did have intercourse, whether the
couple talked about contraception or sexually transmit-
ted infections and whether one of them used some method
of birth control every time they had sexual intercourse.
Results: Knowing one's partner as a friend (vs being ac-
quaintances) before a romantic relationship was protec-
tive against engaging in sexual intercourse for male and
female adolescents (odds ratios and 95% confidence in-
tervals, 0.66 [0.51-0.86] and 0.76 [0.62-0.94], respec-
tively). For female adolescents, sexually active relation-
ships with partners they had not known before the
romantic relationship began were less likely to include
discussions of sexually transmitted infections or contra-
ception, and were less likely to include consistent use of
birth control (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals,
0.37 [0.22-0.62] and 0.62 [0.39-0.99], respectively). Pre-
romantic social ties did not play a statistically signifi-
cant role for these outcomes among male adolescents
(odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals of friends and
of those who had not met, respectively, are 0.85 [0.60-
1.18] and 0.90 [0.50-1.63] for talking about sexually trans-
mitted infections or contraception and 0.93 [0.66-1.30]
and 1.17 [0.71-1.96] for always using birth control).
Conclusion: The existence and nature of an adoles-
cent's prior relationship with a future romantic partner
have significant implications for an adolescent couple's
later sexual decisions, but patterns differ for male and
female adolescents.

ADOLESCENCE AND YOUNG
adulthood represent a time
of high risk for unin-
tended pregnancies and
sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs).1-3 About 80% of pregnan-
cies among teenagers are unintended,
and an estimated 1 in 10 young women
aged 15 to 19 years experiences at least 1
unintended pregnancy.4 Consistent con-
traception use is fundamental to prevent-
ing unintended pregnancies among sexu-
ally active young people. For example,
about half of adolescents and young
adults aborting a pregnancy report that
they were using a contraceptive method
during the month of conception, but 76%
of all birth control pill users and 49% of
condom users aborting a pregnancy
reported inconsistent method use as lead-
ing to the pregnancy.5
Individual factors that have been asso-
ciated with contraception use include sex,
race and ethnicity, family structure, paren-
tal education, and school grades.6-8 How-
ever, couple structure and dynamics pro-
vide a social context for all reproductive
negotiationsandbehaviorofthecouple.Be-
cause adolescents generally lack substan-
tial experience in romantic relationships,9
they may be unsure of how to initiate and
conduct discussions about contraception
with romantic partners. The level of famil-
iarity between partners before romantic
involvement may influence this communi-
cation and negotiation. For example, ado-
lescents may feel more at ease in romantic
relationships with partners who were al-
ready their friends or acquaintances.
National estimates of romantic rela-
tionships indicate that 55% of all US ado-
lescents have experienced a romantic re-

increasing monotonically with the age of the adoles-
cents.10 There is little research available on the health ben-
efits, if any, of knowing partners as friends or acquain-
tances before romantic involvement. The existing
literature has focused on contraceptive use within rela-
tionships that were already sexual, rather than on ro-
mantic relationships that may or may not involve inter-
course. At first sexual intercourse, female adolescents who
have just met their sexual partner are less likely to use
contraception than those who have first sex in the con-
text of an existing romantic relationship, such as going
steady.6 In addition, adolescents are more likely to ever
use a condom with a partner from the same school than
with one from a different school.7 Although adolescent
males and females report different contraceptive use pat-
terns and different attitudes toward sexuality and ro-
mance,8,10-12 the possibility that the associations be-
tween relationship characteristics and contraceptive
behavior vary by sex is largely unexplored.

METHODS
We analyzed data from 2826 male and 3832 female adoles-
cents who reported having an opposite-sex romantic partner
in Wave II of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health). Add Health is a probability-based nation-
ally representative survey of US adolescents who were en-
rolled in grades 7 through 12 during the 1994-1995 school year.
Wave I in-home questionnaires were administered via laptop
computer; audio-computer­assisted self-interviewing technol-
ogy was used to collect information about sensitive behaviors.
Respondents were reinterviewed (Wave II) between April 16
and August 31, 1996.13 All Add Health protocols were re-
viewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board for the
Protection of Human Subjects in the School of Public Health
at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Respondents were asked to identify up to 3 romantic rela-
tionships from the previous 18 months (respondents self-
identified the relationships as romantic). About 28% of respon-
dents in our sample reported more than 1 partner. To standardize
analyses across respondents, minimize recall bias, and reflect
the most current experiences, we identified the most recent op-
posite-sex relationship from the list based on the start date of
the relationship for our analyses.
MEASURES
Dependent Variables
Respondents were asked to examine cards that described things
that might have happened in their romantic relationship. They
were then asked to reject those cards that described things that
had not happened and keep those cards that described things
that had happened. We constructed dichotomous variables for
whether the couple had intercourse and whether the couple
talked about contraception or STIs, based on whether respon-
dents kept the cards for "We talked about contraception or sexu-
ally transmitted diseases" and "We had sexual intercourse." Re-
spondents who indicated that they had sex with their partner
were also asked if they or their partner used some method of
birth control every time they had sexual intercourse.
Independent Variables
Respondents were asked in what ways they knew their partner
before the romantic relationship began. Answers were used to
construct a 3-category measure of preromantic social ties: (1)
friends before the romance began, (2) acquaintances who knew
each other (through school, church, the neighborhood, or other
ways) but were not friends, or (3) persons who had never met
before the romance began (the relationship became romantic
right away).
Control Variables
Various characteristics of individuals may influence how they
choose a partner (eg, whether they are attracted romantically
to friends or strangers) and their risk behaviors. We included
several potential confounders that are often tied to sexual
behavior in the literature, including the respondent's sex (fe-
male or male), age (as a continuous variable), race (white,
black, or other), parental education (did any parent go
beyond high school), and family structure (2 biological par-
ents; 2 parents, not both biological; mother only; father only;
or other). We also controlled for the duration of the relation-
ship (in months) because evidence indicates that adolescents
in relationships of a longer duration are more likely to ever
use contraceptives with that partner but less likely to always
use a method.7,8,14
ANALYSES
Multinomial logistic regression was used to obtain adjusted es-
timates of the odds of having sexual intercourse with the most
recent partner and of talking about contraception or STIs, and
using birth control consistently. Male and female adolescents
were modeled separately. The models for intercourse used data
from all the respondents with opposite-sex romantic partners
in our study sample. Models of the other outcomes were re-
stricted to respondents who reported having intercourse in that
relationship. The duration of the relationship and the respon-
dent's age, sex, race, parental education, and family structure
were included as control variables. Statistical software (Stata)
was used to incorporate weights and adjust for Add Health's
sampling design.15
RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES
Demographic and Control Variables
Of the 6658 respondents with a romantic partner at Wave
II, most were white, had parents with more than a high
school education, and lived with 2 biological parents
(Table 1).

Independent Social Ties Variables
Most respondents with romantic partners reported hav-
ing met the partner before the romance began, and more
than a third considered the partner a friend before the
romantic involvement (Table 1).
Outcomes
At Wave II, just less than half of the sample reported hav-
ing intercourse with their most recent partner (Table 1).
Of these persons, most reported that they had talked about
contraception or STIs with their partner and that they
always used birth control. Although more female ado-
lescents reported that they talked about STIs or contra-
ception with their partners, more male adolescents re-
ported actually using birth control every time (Table 1).
MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS
By using acquaintances (the largest group) as the refer-
ent group, we next examined the association between so-
cial ties and the various sexual outcomes using logistic
regression models.
Intercourse
Being friends before the romantic relationship began was
associated with a lower likelihood of intercourse com-
pared with being acquaintances for male and female ado-
lescents (Table 2). Not knowing the partner before the
romance did not differ significantly from just being ac-
quaintances. The odds of intercourse increased with re-
lationship duration, respondent's age, and family struc-
tures that are not 2 biological parents. The odds of
intercourse decreased with higher parental education. The
odds of intercourse were also higher for black male ado-
lescents compared with white male adolescents.
Talking About STIs or Contraception
The odds of talking about STIs or contraception were
substantially lower for female adolescents who did not
know their partner before their romantic involvement
compared with female adolescents with partners who
were acquaintances. However, being friends did not
increase the odds of talking about these issues com-
pared with just being acquaintances (Table 2). For male
adolescents, the odds of discussing these issues did not
differ significantly between groups. Older age and
higher parental education levels were associated with
discussing STIs or contraception among female adoles-
cents, and longer duration of the relationship was asso-
ciated with greater odds of discussing these issues for
male and female adolescents.
Always Using Birth Control
As with the previous outcome, the odds of always using
birth control with a partner are lower for female adoles-
cents who did not know their partner before their
romantic involvement, while for male adolescents the
odds of always using birth control did not differ signifi-
cantly across groups (Table 2). Although black adoles-
cents did not differ significantly from white adolescents
on always using birth control, adolescents of other race
had lower odds of always using birth control compared
with white adolescents. Among female adolescents,
higher parental education was associated with always
using birth control.
COMMENT
The results of this study indicate that the nature of the
beginning of an adolescent's relationship with a future
romantic partner has significant implications for an
adolescent couple's later sexual decisions. Knowing
one's partner as a friend before beginning a romantic
relationship was protective against engaging in sexual
intercourse with that partner for male and female ado-
lescents. However, for some outcomes, the patterns of
this association are different for male and female adoles-
cents, suggesting qualitative differences in the way male
and female adolescents approach sexual decision mak-
ing and negotiations in romantic relationships. For
female adolescents, romantic relationships with part-
ners they had not met before were less likely to include
discussions of STIs or contraception, and controlling
for relationship duration, were less likely to include
always using birth control. Preromantic social ties did

not play a statistically significant role in these outcomes
among male adolescents.
The literature indicates that female adolescents tend
to romanticize relationships while male adolescents em-
phasize the sexual aspects.11 Female adolescents also tend
to connect sexual activity with greater levels of commit-
ment in a relationship.12 If female adolescents are fol-
lowing a more idealized romantic script, they may find
it difficult to bring up topics like contraception in rela-
tionships that become romantic right away because they
only know that partner in a romantic context. A male ado-
lescent who is thinking of a relationship in more sexu-
alized terms may be more inclined to address such prac-
tical concerns.
Sex roles of normative behavior for male and female
adolescents still differ in important ways that may influ-
ence sexual negotiations. Female adolescents are judged
more harshly in regard to their sexual activities than
male adolescents, are more likely to feel ambivalence
about their sexuality, and are more concerned about
how their sexual activity will be labeled by others.16
Female adolescent sexual behavior also tends to be
more influenced by social control processes than that of
male adolescents,17 so these sex roles may influence
their behavior more. Female adolescents may avoid
planning ahead for consistent contraception use
because this might imply that they intend or want to
have sex, an attitude they might associate with mascu-
line sex roles. Our findings that female adolescents are
more likely to talk to partners about STIs and contra-
ceptives if they were friends or acquaintances before
becoming romantic partners suggest that a preexisting
social relationship may change the couple's negotiation
process by emboldening female adolescents, thereby
facilitating communication and perhaps increased
female control. Alternatively, the type of male partner
may differ in these various relationship situations. In
relationships that become romantic right away, male
adolescents may be more aggressive in demanding sex
or refusing to use contraception. The expectations of
both partners may differ depending on the type of rela-
tionship.
The findings of this study should be interpreted with
caution. It is possible that adolescents who are more prone
to high-risk behavior seek out relationships with part-
ners whom they do not already know. Furthermore, while
we can determine if they were acquaintances or friends
first with their most recent romantic partners, we can-
not determine how long adolescents knew each other be-
fore the romantic relationship began. Add Health al-
lowed respondents to interpret what qualified as a
romantic relationship. Although this has the benefit of
enabling respondents to classify their relationships based
on their feelings and personal experiences instead of on
imposed checklists or terms such as dating, it is pos-
sible that groups of adolescents interpreted the term dif-
ferently.
Additional quantitative and qualitative research is
needed to better understand how friendship experi-
ences and previous social ties between partners may in-
fluence couples' interaction processes. For example, do
female adolescents feel more comfortable talking or as-
serting themselves with male adolescents with whom they
are already familiar? Are they more reluctant to inter-

rupt a romantic moment with practical concerns when
they are with partners whom they have only known in a
romantic context? These are important questions for fu-
ture research. Identifying couples who may be at el-
evated risk for sexual risk taking and examining the pro-
tective processes that are associated with having known
partners may help to develop potential interventions for
enhancing adolescent couples' communication and safe
sexual decisions. For example, training adolescents to im-
prove practical communication skills and to challenge
aspects of traditional romantic scripts that discourage ac-
tive roles for both partners in contraceptive decisions may
contribute to safer sexual decisions regardless of the pre-
romantic history of partners.
