People tend to automatically mimic others. This tendency is
so compelling that people will mimic the behavior of a
nearby stranger with whom they are not even interacting
(Chartrand & Bargh, 1999), and people are generally
unaware that they are engaging in mimicry (Bavelas, Black,
Lemery, & Mullett, 1986; Chartrand & Bargh, 1999). Much
research has found that mimicry has many socially useful
functions that help strengthen interpersonal bonds, such as
increasing rapport, liking, empathy, and prosocial behavior
(for review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). Chartrand and
Lakin (2013) highlight two recent themes in the mimicry
literature: moderators that lead to more or less mimicry in a
given situation, for example, social, motivational, and emo-
tional factors; and downstream consequences of mimicry,
for example, prosocial behavior, attitudes, and consumer
preferences. Other research has examined what factors may
increase mimicry of another person (see Chartrand & Bargh,
1999; Chartrand, Maddux, & Lakin, 2005; Guéguen, 2012;
Guéguen & Martin, 2009; Sanchez-Burks, 2002; van Swol,
2003). This study explores how sharing the same opinion
with another person may increase a participant's behavioral
mimicry of that person.
Researchers have found that people imitate each other on
a wide range of behaviors (for review, see Chartrand &
Lakin, 2013; Dijksterhuis, Chartrand, & Aarts, 2007). For
example, both infants and adults imitate the facial expres-
sions of others (Meltzoff & Moore, 1977, 1983; Zajonc,
Adelmann, Murphy, & Niedenthal, 1987). People tend to
mimic each other's speech (Giles, Coupland, & Coupland,
1991; Neumann & Strack, 2000; Webb, 1969, 1972),
linguistic style (Ireland & Pennebaker, 2010), yawning
(Provine, 1986), and laughter (Young & Frye, 1966). People
also mimic the posture and nonverbal body movements of
their interaction partners (LaFrance, 1979, 1982; Lakin,
Chartrand, & Arkin, 2008; Stel & Vonk, 2010). For example,
Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found that when a confederate
engaged in a specific nonverbal behavior, participants were
more likely to display that nonverbal behavior when interact-
ing with the confederate. Finally, in dyadic interactions, part-
ners often synchronize their speech rhythms (Cappella &
Planalp, 1981; Dittmann & Llewellyn, 1968, 1969).
Mimicry is so prevalent in interaction because it serves
many useful social functions that increase interpersonal
bonds (Lakin, Jefferis, Cheng, & Chartrand, 2003). Chartrand
et al. (2005) propose that mimicry was adaptive in our evolu-
tionary past and continues to serve an adaptive function by
increasing empathy, liking, rapport, and affiliation in interac-
tions. Chartrand and Bargh (1999) found that confederates
who mimicked participants were liked more than confeder-
ates who did not engage in mimicry. Other research has
found that mimicry can increase rapport and empathy in an
interaction (Bavelas et al., 1986; Charney, 1966; LaFrance,
1979; LaFrance & Broadbent, 1976; Ramanathan & McGill,

The Effects of Shared Opinions on
Nonverbal Mimicry
Lyn M. Van Swol1 and Meghann L. Drury-Grogan2
Abstract
People often mimic each other. Research has examined the positive social benefits of mimicry and factors that lead to
increased mimicry. Two studies examine whether a participant is more likely to mimic nonverbal behavior of someone
who shares the same opinion as the participant than someone who does not. The participant made a decision between two
vacation destinations and discussed the choice in a three-person group. The two other group members were confederates.
One agreed with the participant's choice and one disagreed. Each confederate emitted a different nonverbal behavior
consistently throughout discussion. Results offer some support to the hypothesis that the participant would be more likely
to mimic nonverbal behavior of the confederate who is in agreement with the participant.

2008; Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1987) and prosocial
behavior (Kirschner & Tomasello, 2010; Valdesolo &
DeSteno, 2011; van Baaren, Holland, Steenaert, & van
Knippenberg, 2003; Wiltermuth & Heath, 2009). van Baaren,
Holland, Kawakami, and van Knippenberg (2004) found that
people who had been mimicked were more prosocial even to
someone other than the person who mimicked them. Thus,
the positive relational effects of mimicry extend beyond the
interacting partners to include those who are not involved in
the interaction. Finally, researchers (Bailenson & Yee, 2005;
Herrmann, Rossberg, Huber, Landwehr, & Henkel, 2011;
Jacob, Guéguen, Martin, & Boulbry, 2011; van Swol, 2003)
have found that mimickers are rated as more persuasive than
nonmimickers and more successful in a negotiation (Swaab,
Maddux, & Sinaceur, 2011) and a mediation if mimicry
occurs over an extensive interaction (Fischer-Lokou et al.,
2014). Mimicry, therefore, serves a useful purpose in propa-
gating relationships and prosocial behaviors, even to
strangers.
However, while research has long established the social
benefits of mimicry, researchers have also been examining
what factors may lead to more mimicry. Some researchers
have found cultural differences in the tendency to engage in
mimicry. Sanchez-Burks, Lee, Choi, Nisbett, Zhao, and Koo
(2003) proposed that less attention is paid to indirect, rela-
tional communication in the workplace in the United States
than in other countries because of the United States's history
of a Protestant relational ideology that emphasizes the impor-
tance of limiting interpersonal concerns in the workplace and
separating the domains of work and leisure. Therefore, there
is less emphasis on relational communication such as non-
verbal mimicry in U.S. workplaces than in workplaces in
other countries, and people in the United States raised in tra-
ditions of Calvinist Protestantism are less likely to engage in
nonverbal mimicry in the workplace (Sanchez-Burks, 2002).
Furthermore, researchers have examined how several
variables can increase mimicry, including perspective taking,
high self-monitoring, similarity, context dependence, inter-
dependent self-construal, goals of affiliation, and rapport
(for review, see Chartrand & Lakin, 2013). For example,
incidental similarity, such as sharing the same name or major,
can increase mimicry (Guéguen, 2012; Guéguen & Martin,
2009). Given the important social benefits of mimicry,
understanding how mimicry may be increased is an impor-
tant avenue toward increasing positive interactions in inter-
personal exchanges, and similarity may be an important
means toward increasing mimicry.
Other research has confirmed the importance of similar-
ity and examined how sharing the same opinion on an issue
could lead to more mimicry, particularly how sharing the
same viewpoint with someone may increase mimicry of
that person (LaFrance, 1982; Navarre & Emihovich, 1978;
Scheflen, 1964). For example, LaFrance (1982) argued
that nonverbal mimicry could be the result of shared view-
points, and Cheng and Chartrand (2003) demonstrated that
among high self-monitors, mimicry increases as a function
of perceived self­other similarity. Van Swol (2003) had
participants discuss an issue in a group with two other peo-
ple who were actually confederates. One confederate
agreed with the participant and one disagreed. Furthermore,
each confederate elicited a different nonverbal behavior
throughout the discussion. The data showed a trend toward
participants mimicking the nonverbal behavior of the con-
federate who agreed with them more than the confederate
who disagreed, but the results were not significant. The
author suggested that low power could underlie the lack of
significant results, and suggested that further research
examining shared viewpoints and mimicry use a sample
size larger than their 38 participants (van Swol, 2003). A
workplace task for the group discussion was also used, and
given that in the United States, nonverbal mimicry may be
inhibited in work settings due to the Protestant relational
ideology (Sanchez-Burks, 2002), use of a different type of
task to test the relationship between shared viewpoints and
nonverbal mimicry is important.
Therefore, the two experiments in this article add to van
Swol (2003) by using larger sample sizes and a less work-
oriented group discussion task to test the hypothesis that par-
ticipants will be more likely to imitate a nonverbal behavior
when that behavior is emitted by a confederate who agrees
with the participant than a confederate who disagrees.
Because nonverbal mimicry is strongly related to increased
rapport, empathy, and liking (Chartrand & Lakin, 2013), a
relationship between agreement and increased mimicry
could indicate how mimicry may mediate a relationship
between agreement and liking or strengthen the tendency to
like and empathize with those who agree with us. Given that
similarity can be established even through incidental means
such as names and birthdays (Guéguen, 2012; Guéguen &
Martin, 2009), similarity could be an especially easy way to
improve social interactions through mimicry. Furthermore,
given that mimicry may be sensitive to task (Sanchez-Burks,
2002), it is important to examine mimicry and its conse-
quences in a variety of tasks.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants and design.There were 69 participants who
completed the experiment for partial credit in a communi-
cation studies class at a large Midwestern university in the
United States. Participants were randomly assigned to
conditions. Six participants were excluded from analysis
because they indicated suspicion in the posttask question-
naire or noticed the nonverbal behavior of the confeder-
ates. One participant was excluded due to camera
difficulties. Data from 62 participants were used; the
agreeing confederate either shook their foot (n = 34) or
touched their face (n = 28).
Van Swol and Drury-Grogan 3
Procedure.When the participant arrived, he or she was
brought to a room where one of the confederates was already
waiting with a signed consent form, and the participant was
given informed consent. Then the second confederate arrived
and was given informed consent. After informed consent, the
experimenter explained that the purpose of the experiment
was to study how discussing one's preference in a group
affects one's decision and behavior. Thus, it was explained
that after making an individual decision alone, participants
would be discussing their decision in a group.
Participants were asked to pretend they won a trip in a
student contest, and they could choose between two vacation
destinations in the Caribbean. The participant and confeder-
ates were given a written description of the contest and infor-
mation about each fictitious Caribbean island and then given
a sheet to record their initial, individual decision and rate
their confidence in their decision from 1 (very confident) to 9
(not at all confident). They were instructed to individually
read through the information and make a decision about
which island they wanted to visit. The experimenter then
escorted the confederates out of the room, stating that every-
one would work in separate rooms.
After 8 to 10 minutes, the experimenter checked the
progress of the participant. When the participant had made
a decision, the experimenter collected his or her decision
sheet and said that she wanted to check the camera. At this
point, the experimenter turned the camera on to record a
baseline of the participant's behavior when alone. A base-
line was collected to obtain a measure of how much the
participants engaged in the measured nonverbal behaviors
naturally without a confederate emitting them. In 10 of the
trials, the participant moved out of the camera's angle or
the experimenter forgot to turn the camera on early. A base-
line was recorded for 52 trials. The average baseline was
1.70 min (SD = 1.58 min).
After turning the camera on, the experimenter stated that
she would check the progress of the other two participants.
After waiting about 2 min to record a baseline, the confeder-
ates were both brought back into the main experimental
room. The three group members sat facing each other. There
was no obstruction between them so the participant had a full
body view of both confederates. The experimenter read the
following instructions:
Now I want you to discuss your choice with the other participants.
If you picked a different vacation than someone else, please
explain your choice to the other two participants telling them
why you picked that vacation.Also, if another participant picked
a different vacation than you, please listen to their information.
You do not have to stick to your original preference if you learn
new information that changes your mind. You will not make a
group decision, but you will be asked to make an individual
decision after the group discussion.
The experimenter asked whether anyone had any questions
and then told the group that she would check back in 10
minutes but if they finished before, they should come get her
in the next room. The participant and confederates kept their
information sheet during the discussion to provide a loose
script of information for the confederates to discuss.
The participant was videotaped throughout the whole
group discussion, although the camera was positioned so that
it appeared as if the whole group was being taped. One con-
federate agreed with the participant's choice of vacation des-
tination and one disagreed. Furthermore, one confederate
shook his or her foot throughout and one repeatedly touched
his or her face. Confederates were blind to the experimental
hypotheses. The use of a triad methodology in a mimicry
study, pioneered by Dabbs (1969), allows the nontarget con-
federate to serve as a control within the same interaction. We
counterbalanced whether the agreeing confederate touched
his or her face or shook his or her foot. Furthermore, four
different confederates were used for the experiment, and we
counterbalanced whether they shook their foot or touched
their face and whether they agreed with the participant or
disagreed. Thus, each confederate alternated between agree-
ment or disagreement and between shaking his or her foot or
touching his or her face.
For touching the face, the confederate was instructed to
put a couple of fingers or part of their hand for a few seconds
on any part of the face from the forehead to the chin and then
shift the hand away. They were instructed to touch the face
for approximately 50% to 70% of the time during the trial.
For shaking the foot, the confederates could either cross their
legs and shake their foot from the ankle or the knee or set the
lower part of one leg across the knee of the other leg and
shake their ankle. They were instructed to shake their leg
during 50% to 70% of the trial. When shaking their leg, the
confederates were instructed to have a steady, but not too
vigorous, movement of the leg from the ankle and/or knee.
Other than the specific nonverbal behavior, both confeder-
ates were instructed to act similarly in both the agreement
and disagreement conditions.
The group discussion lasted for a mean of 6.18 minutes
(SD = 2.18 min, range = 2.38-13.48 min). After the discus-
sion, the experimenter collected the information sheets,
passed out a posttask questionnaire, and escorted the confed-
erates out of the room. The questionnaire asked participants
to again pick a vacation destination and rate their confidence.
Participants were also asked, "What do you think the pur-
pose of this research is?", "What did you notice most about
the other two participants?", "Did any of the other two par-
ticipants engage in any noticeable mannerisms during the
experiment?", and "Was there anything about the other two
participants'behavior that made you feel awkward or uncom-
fortable?" Five participants were excluded from data analy-
sis because their answers indicated that they knew the
experiment was staged. One other participant was excluded
from analysis because he wrote that he noticed one of the
staged nonverbal behaviors. Upon completion of the ques-
tionnaire, participants were thanked and asked to provide an
4 SAGE Open
address if they wished to be debriefed upon completion of
data collection. Because of the use of confederates, partici-
pants were not immediately debriefed.
Coding. Three independent coders unaware of any hypothe-
ses coded the trials. One coder was used as the primary coder
and coded all trials, and the other two were secondary cod-
ers. The secondary coders split up the trials and each coded
about half of them. Coders were instructed to count any up
and down or back and forth movement of the leg and foot
originating from the ankle or knee as an instance of "shaking
the foot." Crossing and uncrossing the legs did not count.
The coder counted each time a participant moved his or her
foot back and forth as one instance of "shaking the foot."
Coders were instructed to count any time the participant's
hand touched the face and moved away as an instance of
"touching the face." Touching the hair, neck, and ears did not
count as an instance, nor did covering one's mouth to sneeze
or cough. If a participant put his or her hand on the face and
kept it there, then the coders were instructed to count every 5
seconds that the hand rested on the face as one instance of
"touching the face."
Coders counted the instances of nonverbal behavior both
in the baseline and main experiment. The main coder's count
of touching the face in the baseline and experiment corre-
lated with both the first (baseline: intraclass correlation
[ICC] = .86, p < .0001; experiment: ICC = .84, p < .0001)
and second (baseline: ICC = .71, p < .0001; experiment: ICC
= .84, p < .0001) secondary coders. The main coder's count
of shaking the foot also correlated with the first (baseline:
ICC = .99, p < .0001; experiment: ICC = .82, p < .0001) and
second (baseline: ICC = .93, p < .0001; experiment: ICC =
.65, p < .0001) secondary coders. The main coder's numbers
were used for the analyses.
Results
No participant changed his or her choice of vacation destina-
tion after meeting in the group with the two confederates.
Thirty-six (58%) participants chose one vacation option, and
26 (42%) chose the other. This difference was not signifi-
cant, 2 = 1.61, p = .20. But participants' confidence in their
decision (before: M = 3.98, SD = 1.79; after: M = 3.33, SD =
2.32) did increase after meeting in the group, F(1, 60) = 8.75,
2 = .13, p = .004. Note that lower numbers represent higher
confidence.
The total number of foot shakes and face touches was
divided by the minutes of discussion for each trial to deter-
mine an average number of shakes or touches per minute.
Table 1 reports the number of face touches and foot shakes
per minute in the main experiment and baseline. The num-
ber of face touches and foot shakes per minute in the base-
line was compared in a paired samples t test. The difference
was not significant, t(51) = 0.42, Cohen's d = . 08, p = .68.
Therefore, in the baseline, the participants were not more
likely to elicit one nonverbal behavior more than the other.
The number of face touches and foot shakes per minute in
the main experiment also was compared in a paired samples
t test. This difference was significant, t(61) = 3.15, Cohen's
d = . 66, p = .003. Thus, participants were more likely to
shake their foot than touch their face during the main experi-
ment. Neither did participants' foot shakes in the baseline
correlate with their foot shakes during the experiment, r =
.14, p = .31, nor did their face touching in the baseline cor-
relate with face touching during the main experiment, r =
.23, p = .10. The participants' amount of leg shakes and face
touching during the experiment did not correlate with each
other, r = .06, p = .66.
A mixed model ANOVA with the within-subjects variable
of type of movement (foot shakes, face touches) and the
between-subjects variable of which behavior the agreeing
confederate emitted tested for differences. There was a sig-
nificant interaction between type of movement and which
behavior the agreeing confederate emitted, F(1, 60) = 4.20,2
= .07, p = .045. Participants were more likely (Cohen's d = .
49) to shake their foot in the condition in which the agreeing
confederate shook his or her foot (M = 8.42, SD = 11.97) than
when the disagreeing confederate shook their foot (M = 3.93,
SD = 4.93), and participants were more likely (Cohen's d =
.18) to touch their face when the agreeing confederate also
touched his or her face (M = 2.69, SD = 4.59) than in the
condition in which the disagreeing confederate touched his

or her face (M = 1.95, SD = 3.62). For the 52 trials with a
baseline, the number of foot shakes per minute and number
of face touches per minute in the baseline were included as
covariates in an ANCOVA. Although the participant was
more likely (Cohen's d = . 40) to shake his or her foot in the
condition in which the agreeing confederate shook his or her
foot (M = 7.90, SD = 10.73) than when the disagreeing con-
federate shook his or her foot (M = 4.52, SD = 5.23) and was
more likely (Cohen's d = .24) to touch his or her face in the
condition in which the agreeing confederate touched his or
her face (M = 3.20, SD = 4.94) than when the disagreeing
confederate touched his or her face (M = 2.13, SD = 3.88),
the interaction between type of movement and which behav-
ior the agreeing confederate emitted was not significant, F(1,
48) = 3.17, 2 = .06, p = .08.
Discussion
The results lend some support for the hypothesis. Participants
shook their foot more when the agreeing confederate shook
his or her foot than when the disagreeing confederate shook
his or her foot, and they touched their face more when the
agreeing confederate touched his or her face than when the
disagreeing confederate touched his or her face. These results
suggest that people are more likely to mimic the nonverbal
behavior of someone who agrees with them than someone
who disagrees. However, when the baseline was used as a
covariate to account for participants' behavior when alone,
the results approached, but no longer reached, significance.
The first experiment had some problems that may account
for the lack of strong significant results and that we try to
correct in the second experiment. First, the baseline used
may not have been appropriate. An individual's nonverbal
behavior alone may differ considerably from an individual's
nonverbal behavior when interacting with other people
(Kraut & Johnston, 1979). The lack of correlation between
participants' baseline behavior and their nonverbal behavior
in the experiment suggests that their nonverbal behavior
alone was very different from their behavior in the presence
of others. Also, we did not have a baseline for 10 people,
which lowered the power of the test when including the base-
line as a covariate. Furthermore, in Experiment 1, the effect
sizes of the test without a covariate and the ANCOVA were
very similar so adding the covariate of baseline behavior did
very little toward controlling the variance. The fact that the
test for leg shakes had a significant difference between the
agreement and disagreement conditions but the ANCOVA
was not significant is more likely explained by a drop in
power in the ANCOVA due to the use of a smaller sample
size. Therefore, Experiment 2 uses a more appropriate base-
line in which the participant interacts with the confederates
during the baseline.
Also, Experiment 1 had no manipulation check on con-
federates. Although confederates were blind to the experi-
mental hypotheses, they could have easily guessed that
agreement with the participant could affect the participant's
behavior differently than disagreement. Furthermore, con-
federates may have enjoyed agreeing with the participant
more and may have acted more enthusiastically or smiled
more when in agreement. This offers an alternative hypoth-
esis for why there was a tendency for participants to imitate
the confederates' leg shaking more in the agreement condi-
tion. Therefore, we included a manipulation check on the
confederates'behavior in the second experiment to try to rule
out this alternative hypothesis. Experiment 1 also did not
check whether confederates were, in fact, engaging in their
assigned behavior and at what rate, and, therefore, this is
examined in Experiment 2 as well.
Although there was not a significant difference between
the number of foot shakes and face touches in the baseline,
participants were more likely to shake their foot during the
experiment. This suggests that, in general, people may be
more likely to mimic foot shaking behavior than face touch-
ing. In other words, when alone, people may be just as likely
to shake their foot as touch their face, but when interacting
with others, foot shaking may be more contagious than
touching one's face. We used these two nonverbal behaviors
because they have been used in previous research (Chartrand
& Bargh, 1999; van Swol, 2003). It is possible that face
touching is more controllable than foot shaking or that some
participants may have been more reluctant to touch their face
due to the use of makeup or presence of facial hair. Therefore,
we use arm touching instead of face touching as a nonverbal
behavior in the second experiment.
Another reason participants may have been less likely to
touch their face is that they were holding their information
sheets during the interaction. This may have kept their hands
occupied. Furthermore, some participants avoided eye con-
tact with the confederates by looking at their information
sheets, and this may have diminished their attention to the
confederates' nonverbal behavior. Therefore, in the second
experiment, the experimenter collected the information
sheets before the discussion, and participants discussed the
information from memory and had no paper to hold during
the discussion.
The discussion time in Experiment 1 was short. By allow-
ing the participants and confederates to get the experimenter
when the group discussion seemed to be ending, the confed-
erates were often misjudging the time and ending the discus-
sion after only 5 min. Therefore, in the second experiment,
confederates were instructed to keep the discussion going
until the experimenter came to check on the group's prog-
ress. A longer discussion time may allow the participant to
observe the confederates' nonverbal behavior more and pos-
sibly establish a better rapport with the confederates. This
may ensure stronger results. Finally, Experiment 1 used a
main coder rather than taking the mean of two or three cod-
ers. Although reliability between the main coder and second-
ary coders was acceptable, Experiment 2 takes the mean of
the coders rather than relying on one coder.

Experiment 2
Method
Participants and design. There were 57 participants who com-
pleted the experiment for partial credit in a communication
studies class at a large Midwestern university. Two partici-
pants were excluded from analysis. One changed their opin-
ion after the group discussion and was excluded because we
could not tell which confederate was agreed with during the
discussion. The second excluded participant suspected the
use of confederates. Data from 55 participants were used.
Participants were randomly assigned to conditions of either
the agreeing confederate shaking his or her foot (n = 27) or
the agreeing confederate touching his or her arm (n = 28).
Procedure. Experiment 2 used the same vacation destination
task as Experiment 1. Participants received informed consent
and made an individual decision according to the same pro-
cedure as Experiment 1. After the participant made an indi-
vidual decision alone, the experimenter collected his or her
decision sheet and information sheet. Neither the participant
nor the confederates kept their information sheet during the
discussion to avoid distractions. The experimenter then
brought both confederates back into the main experimental
room.
The experimenter told the group to engage in talk to "get
acquainted" for 2 min. They were to introduce themselves
and not talk about the vacation destination task yet. The con-
federates were instructed to not engage in their designated
nonverbal behavior during this 2-min baseline. This was to
record a baseline of the participant's nonverbal behavior
when talking to the group members. There were two cameras
in the room. One recorded the behavior of the participant,
and the second camera was used to record the confederates
for 30 of the trials to provide a manipulation check on the
confederates' behavior. For the other trials in which the con-
federates were not recorded, the second camera was still in
the room and the experimenter pretended to turn it on. After
turning the cameras on, the experimenter stated that she
would return in approximately 2 min to explain the next
steps of the experiment. A baseline was recorded for all tri-
als. The average baseline was 2.04 min (SD = 0.33 min).
After 2 min, the experimenter returned and read the same
instructions to the group as in Experiment 1.
The experimenter asked whether anyone had any ques-
tions and then told the group that she would check back in 8
to 10 minutes. Even if they felt they were finished, the group
was instructed to continue talking about the vacation destina-
tions until the experimenter returned. The group discussion
lasted for a mean of 8.41 min (SD = 0.72 min, range = 6.80-
9.60 min). When the experimenter returned, she asked
whether the group was finished. All indicated that they were.
One confederate agreed with the participant's choice of
vacation destination and one disagreed. One confederate
shook his or her foot throughout and one repeatedly touched
his or her arms. It was counterbalanced whether the agreeing
confederate touched his or her arms or shook his or her foot.
Furthermore, four different confederates were used for the
experiment, and it was counterbalanced whether they shook
their foot or touched their arms and whether they agreed or
disagreed.
For touching the arms, the confederate was instructed to
put a couple of fingers or part of their hand for a few sec-
onds on any part of the arms from the shoulder to the top of
the hand just above the knuckles and then shift the hand
away. They could also cross their arms, rub their arms, or
scratch their arms. They were instructed to touch their arms
for approximately 50% to 70% of the time. For shaking the
foot, the confederates were given the same instruction as
Experiment 1.
In addition to training the confederates to engage in the
nonverbal behaviors, confederates were instructed to make
mistakes in phrasing that would be expected in natural com-
pared with scripted conversation. In Experiment 1, some of
the participants who suspected the use of confederates stated
that the confederates seemed to know the information too
well. Therefore, confederates were trained to pause or stum-
ble over words, slightly misremember a couple of pieces of
information, and state some pieces of information in a sim-
pler format.
After the discussion, the experimenter passed out a post-
task questionnaire and escorted the confederates out of the
room, so that everyone allegedly could work on the question-
naire individually. The questionnaire asked participants to
again pick a vacation destination and rate their confidence.
The questionnaire also asked, "What do you think the pur-
pose of this research is?", "What did you notice most about
the other two participants?", and "Did any of the other two
participants engage in any noticeable mannerisms during the
experiment?" One participant was excluded from data analy-
sis because his or her answers indicated that he or she knew
the experiment was staged. Upon completion of the ques-
tionnaire, participants were thanked and debriefed according
to the same procedure as Experiment 1.
Coding.Two coders, unaware of the experimental hypothe-
sis, coded all 55 of the trials for foot shaking and arm touch-
ing. The same coding scheme as Experiment 1 was used for
foot shaking. For arm touching, the coders counted as an
instance of arm touching any time the participant touched
and pulled away with their hand or other arm any part of the
arm from above the knuckles to the shoulder. Touching the
fingers together or clasping hands together did not count. If
participants continuously touched their arm by, for example,
having their arms crossed or resting a hand on the other arm,
then the coders counted every 5 seconds as an instance of
arm touching.
The first coder's count of touching the arm in the baseline
and experiment correlated with the second coder (baseline:
Van Swol and Drury-Grogan 7
ICC = .78, p < .0001; experiment: ICC = .94, p < .0001). The
first coder's count of shaking the foot also correlated with the
second coder (baseline: ICC = .88, p < .0001; experiment:
ICC = .98, p < .0001). The mean of both coders' ratings for
each nonverbal behavior was used as the dependent variable
in the analyses.
For 30 of the trials, the two different confederates also
were videotaped so that the behavior of the agreeing and dis-
agreeing confederate could be compared. Two coders,
unaware of the experimental hypothesis, rated the confeder-
ates on a six-point scale from low to high for the following
characteristics: amount of eye contact, amount of smiling,
friendliness, degree to which the confederate appeared to
like the participant, persuasiveness, and talkativeness. The
two coders' ratings significantly correlated for all measures:
amount of eye contact (ICC = .72, p < .0001), amount of
smiling (ICC = .85, p < .0001), friendliness (ICC = .96, p <
.0001); degree to which the confederate appeared to like par-
ticipant (ICC = .93, p < .0001), persuasiveness (ICC = .90, p
< .0001), and talkativeness (ICC = .70, p < .001). The mean
of the two coders' rating for each scale for the two confeder-
ates was analyzed in a paired samples t test (disagreement -
agreement). There were no significant differences between
the rating of the agreeing and disagreeing confederates for
(see Table 2 for means) amount of eye contact, t(29) = 1.21,
Cohen's d = . 21, p = .24; amount of smiling, t(29) = 0.81,
Cohen's d = .11, p = .42; friendliness, t(29) = 1.38, Cohen's
d = .09, p = .18; degree to which the confederate appeared to
like participant, t(29) = 1.20, Cohen's d = .12, p = .24; and
talkativeness, t(29) = -1.72, Cohen's d = -.19, p = .10.
However, the agreeing confederate was rated higher in per-
suasiveness than the disagreeing confederate, t(29) = -2.59,
Cohen's d = -.46, p = .02. Possibly, the coders perceived this
confederate's agreement with the participant as a sign of per-
suasiveness. Therefore, the agreeing and disagreeing confed-
erates were rated as behaving similarly on all measures
except ratings of persuasiveness.
In addition, two coders watched the recordings of confed-
erates with a stop watch application on the computer to try to
assess how much each coder engaged in their assigned
behavior. They pressed a button to activate the stop watch
when the coder engaged in their assigned behavior and
pressed the button again to stop the stop watch when the con-
federate discontinued. The coder watched the video twice
and only coded one confederate per view. The two coders'
ratings correlated for amount of time spent touching their
arm (ICC = .65, p = .003) and amount of time spent foot
shaking (ICC = .83, p < .0001). We took the mean of the two
coders' ratings and divided the amount each coder recorded
by the amount of time of the interaction. On average, confed-
erates assigned to engage in foot shaking were shaking their
feet during 53% of the interaction (M = 0.53, SD = 0.10), and
confederates assigned to arm touching were touching their
arms during 48% of the interaction (M = 0.48, SD = 0.07).
Results
Twenty-nine (53%) participants chose one vacation option,
and 26 (47%) chose the other. This difference was not sig-
nificant, 2 = 0.16, p = .69. Participants' confidence in their
decision did not significantly increase after the group discus-
sion (before: M = 3.36, SD = 1.96; after: M = 3.15, SD =
1.79), F(1, 54) = 2.65, 2 = .05, p = .11.
The total number of foot shakes and arm touches was
divided by the minutes of discussion for each trial to deter-
mine an average number of shakes or touches per minute.
The number of arm touches (M = 1.40, SD = 3.21) and foot
shakes (M = 6.19, SD = 7.02) per minute in the baseline was
compared in a paired samples t test (arm - foot). Participants
had significantly more foot shakes than arm touches, t(54) =
-4.61, Cohen's d = -.88, p < .0001. The number of arm
touches (M = 1.60, SD = 2.69) and foot shakes (M = 7.01, SD
= 10.83) per minute in the main experiment also was com-
pared in a paired samples t test (foot - arm). This difference
was significant, t(54) = 3.60, Cohen's d = .68, p < .001. Thus,
participants were more likely to shake their foot than touch
their arm. Participants' foot shakes in the baseline correlated
with their foot shakes during the experiment, r = .69, p <
.0001, and participants arm touching in the baseline corre-
lated with arm touching during the main experiment, r = .59,
p < .0001. The participants' amount of leg shakes and arm
touching during the experiment did not correlate with each
other, r = .05, p = .71.
We analyzed the number of foot shakes per minute
between conditions. There was a nonsignificant trend
(Cohen's d = .47) for participants to shake their foot more in
the condition in which the agreeing confederate shook his or
her foot (M = 9.58, SD = 13.80) than in the condition in
which the disagreeing confederate shook his or her foot (M =
4.53, SD = 6.19), F(1, 53) = 3.10, 2 = 0.06, p = .08. However,
in support of the hypothesis, when the baseline of partici-
pants' foot shakes was included as a covariate, there was a
significant difference between the condition in which the
agreeing confederate shook his or her foot and the condition
in which the disagreeing confederate shook his or her foot,
F(1, 52) = 6.48, 2 = .11, p = .01.

We also analyzed the number of arm touches per minute
between conditions. In support of the hypothesis, participants
were significantly more (Cohen's d = .55) likely to touch their
arm when the agreeing confederate also touched his or her
arm (M = 2.30, SD = 3.53) than when the disagreeing confed-
erate touched his or her arm (M = 0.88, SD = 1.01), F(1, 53)
= 4.04, 2 = .07, p = .05. However, when the baseline of arm
touching was included as a covariate, the difference was no
longer significant, F(1, 52) = 2.41, 2 = .04, p = .13.
Discussion
The results for mimicking foot shakes and arm touches lend
partial support to the hypothesis that participants would be
more likely to mimic the nonverbal behavior of someone
who agrees with them than someone who disagrees. However,
the results for foot shakes were only significant when the
baseline was included as a covariate, and the results for arm
touches were only significant when the covariate was not
included. Thus, the results were not conclusively significant.
However, Experiment 2 did lend stronger support with stron-
ger effect sizes for the hypothesis than Experiment 1.
Possibly, the changes in methodology from Experiment 1 to
Experiment 2 strengthened the effect.
The manipulation check on confederates' behavior in
Experiment 2 could not completely rule out that the confed-
erates were not acting differently. In particular, the agreeing
confederate was rated as more persuasive. Because the cod-
ers were unaware of the experimental hypothesis, it is pos-
sible that the coders assumed the agreeing confederate was
more persuasive because the participant agreed with him or
her. However, it may be that the agreeing confederate was
indeed acting more persuasive, and this offers an alternative
hypothesis for our results that we cannot rule out. In addi-
tion, coding of the confederates' assigned behavior con-
firmed that confederates were engaging in their assigned
behavior during about half of the interaction.
General Discussion
These two experiments examined whether shared viewpoints
between two group members lead to increased mimicry. For
foot shakes and arm touches, there was partial support that
participants mimic the behavior of the confederate who
agreed with them. However, for the nonverbal behavior of
face touching, the results were not significant. Therefore, the
results lend mixed support to the hypothesis; when signifi-
cant, the effects sizes were small to moderate. This study
used the social task of going on vacation to try to address a
problem found in previous research (van Swol, 2003) that
participants may be less likely to mimic others' nonverbal
behavior on a nonsocial task. People in the United States pay
less attention to indirect, relational communication in work-
place settings (Sanchez-Burks et al., 2003) than in settings
involving leisure. However, this study did not find
unequivocal support that people mimic those who agree with
them in social, leisure settings. However, future research
should do a direct comparison and manipulate type of setting
as an independent variable.
A similar process to perspective taking may underlie the
tendency of people with shared views to mimic one another.
People may be more likely to direct their attention in a con-
versation to a person who is in agreement with them than a
person who is in disagreement. Chartrand and Bargh (1999)
argued that mimicry is caused by an automatic perception­
behavior link such that simply perceiving a behavior is
enough to elicit mimicry of the behavior, usually noncon-
sciously, from the perceiver. Other researchers (LaFrance &
Broadbent, 1976; Tickle-Degnen & Rosenthal, 1987) also
suggested that posture mimicry reflects the attention of the
perceiver toward the person they are mimicking. Thus, peo-
ple may be more susceptible to mimicry of a person who is in
agreement with them because more of their perception and
attention is directed toward that person's behavior than a per-
son who is in disagreement with them. People are more likely
to gaze at faces that are similar to themselves (Hungr &
Hunt, 2012) and gaze at people and objects they like
(Schotter, 2010; Ulloa, Marchetti, Taffou, & George, 2015);
however, future research may want to examine the moderat-
ing role of attention more directly, possibly by measuring
participants' eye gaze toward each confederate to establish
that participants are directing more of their attention toward
the confederate in agreement with them. For example,
research has found that pictures of emotional content
received more participant eye gazes and for longer durations
than neutral content, and even more so if the emotional con-
tent was pleasant rather than nonpleasant (Nummenmaa,
Hyönä, & Calvo, 2006). Perhaps like emotional pictures,
participants might make more eye contact with a confederate
who agrees with them. Likewise, averting eye gaze leads to
participants feeling ostracized and showing related effects of
lowered satisfaction of basic human needs, lowered experi-
ence of relational evaluation, more negative moods, lowered
self-esteem, enhanced temptations to act aggressively, and
an increased feeling that the relationship or interaction was
low in value (Wirth, Sacco, Hugenberg, & Williams, 2010).
Thus, if confederates avoid eye gaze, participants could feel
more ostracized in the conversation and be less likely to
mimic them or change their own opinion.
Another reason people may be more likely to mimic
someone in agreement with them is that mimicry is a form of
communication (Bavelas et al., 1986; Chartrand & Lakin,
2013) that helps to communicate the empathetic message "`I
am with you' or `I am like you'" (Bavelas, Black, Chovil,
Lemery, & Mullett, 1988, p. 278). Thus, mimicry helps com-
municate that the perceiver shares the same feelings as the
person they are mimicking. People may be more willing or
likely to communicate such a nonverbal message to someone
they perceive as more similar to themselves. Previous
research has found that people are more willing to mimic
Van Swol and Drury-Grogan 9
someone who has incidental similarity with them (Guéguen,
2012; Guéguen & Martin, 2009), which suggests that simi-
larity could be driving the mimicry in the results. In addition,
research on empathy has found that people are more likely to
display empathy toward similar others (Baston et al., 1995;
Krebs, 1975; Stotland, 1969). Therefore, participants may
have increased empathy for others who share similar opin-
ions as themselves and may be more likely to mimic their
behavior as communication of that empathy.
Future research should explore other factors that may lead
to increased mimicry between two people. People are more
likely to mimic someone who is more similar to themselves
in other ways besides sharing the same opinion (Cheng &
Chartrand, 2003; Guéguen, 2012; Guéguen & Martin, 2009).
Other research should examine how variables such as "lik-
ing" mediate or moderate the relationship between similarity
and mimicry. For example, it is already known that similarity
increases liking and attraction (Byrne, 1971) and that people
who like each other tend to mimic each other's postures and
mannerisms more than those who do not like each other
(Bernieri, 1988; LaFrance, 1982), but the relationship
between mimicry, liking, and attitudinal similarity can be
tested in a mediation analysis.
Overall, the two experiments and other work (van Swol,
2003) show that the effects of agreement on mimicry are
subtle, inconsistent, and not particularly strong. These find-
ings are in line with other nonconscious phenomenon (Klein
et al., 2014) like priming where results can be inconsistent.
Given the attentional nature of mimicry, results depend on
participants paying attention to other members, and partici-
pants' focus could have varied widely. Furthermore, ten-
dency toward mimicry could depend on how strongly
participants held their prediscussion opinion. In a fictitious
laboratory task, participants may not have been that invested
in agreeing with a certain option.
This study also had several limitations. First, confederates
were engaging in the nonverbal behavior about 50% of the
time in our coded interactions and were instructed to engage in
the behavior 50% to 70% of the time. This may have been too
high an amount of mimicry and led to several participants
noticing the behavior. The mimicry may have been obvious to
several participants, and this may have reduced our ability to
measure nonconscious, automatic mimicry. Second, low
power still may have been an issue with these studies.Although
this study had increased sample size than van Swol's (2003),
cell sizes were about 30 per cell after accounting for suspi-
cious participants. Third, the coding comparing foot shaking
with face touches was problematic with regard to the creation
of rates per minute of face touching. Specifically, if partici-
pants touched their face for an extended period of time, every
5 seconds was counted as a face touch, but if a participant
shook their leg for an extended period of time, every leg shake
was counted as one leg shake. This may have lowered the
amount of face touches in comparison with leg shakes. Finally,
although intercoder reliability was acceptable on all measures,
sometimes reliability was much higher than others. For exam-
ple, in Experiment 2, eye contact and talkativeness had lower
reliability than ratings of friendliness and liking. Friendliness
and liking were general impressions the coders made, whereas
eye contact and talkativeness may have required more atten-
tive coding to frequency that was more difficult for the
coders.
In conclusion, this study used a larger sample size and
different task than van Swol's (2003) study and lent some
support for the hypothesis that people are more likely to
mimic the nonverbal behavior of someone who shares the
same opinion as them than the nonverbal behavior of some-
one who holds a different opinion.
