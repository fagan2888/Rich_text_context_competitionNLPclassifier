Introduction
In principle, the profits of a business organization may be
either distributed in the form of paying dividend to its share-
holders or retained in the business. In the discipline of
finance, the decision of dividend payment is considered as
one of the financial management decisions (Brealey, Mayers,
& Allen, 2012), which mainly reflects corporate dividend
policy. Theoretically, the behavior of paying dividend actu-
ally signals the profitability of the business, and it is distrib-
uted among U.S. shareholders after it is taxed first at the
corporate level and then at the personal level (Hines, 1996).
Regular payouts of dividends are generally valuable to indi-
vidual shareholders who possess intermittent irrational
behavior (Shefrin & Statman, 1984). In other words, the
dividend process represents the remaining disposition of
organizational reserves after the lucrative investment oppor-
tunities are capitalized; therefore, dividend tax rate (if it
remains constant over a period of time) should not affect the
dividend payment behavior (Auerbach, 1979; Bradford,
1981; King, 1977).
Indeed, firms adjust their dividend policies in accordance
with the amount of earnings they hold (Al-Ajmi & Hussain,
2011). Dividend payment behavior has been analyzed by dif-
ferent authors, for example, while studying dividend pay-
ment behavior of 25 common and civil law countries firms,
Ferris, Sen, and Unlu (2009) revealed a diminishing trend
from 72% to 55% within 11 years due to the presence of non-
dividend paying firms. The academic and professional litera-
tures have concluded that the dividend payment patterns
have been decreasing significantly for more than two
decades. This is mainly because of the structural composi-
tion of different firms in the United States as well as their
inability to generate enough profits to be distributed among
shareholders. In fact, these business organizations tend to
retain the total earnings to capitalize on various profitable
growth opportunities. Moreover, according to Doyle (1994),
the companies tend to strengthen their marketing plans
(called right-handed organizations) to put major emphasis
on customer orientation besides incorporating measures to
substantially improve their financial plans (called left-
handed organizations). It is, therefore, important to note that
although firms tend to distribute dividends among sharehold-
ers but often in the form of inconsistent or irregular pattern.
This dividend payment policy is usually exerted by the com-
panies that observe significant variations in their level of
earnings (Fama & French, 2001; Pandey, 2003).

A Sectoral Analysis of Dividend Payment
Behavior: Evidence From Karachi Stock
Exchange
Muhammad Nadeem Khan1 and Moona Shamim1
Abstract
This study analyzes the sector-wise dividend payment behavior of Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) for the period 2009 through
2013. First, the trend of dividend payment of 5 years with respect to all 32 sectors is assessed through descriptive analysis.
Second, the unit root test for panel data and pooled ordinary lest square (POLS) test were used on 15 non-financial
sectors. Results show that the earning per share has a positive impact on dividend payment in eight sectors including
beverages, travel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food processors, household goods, personal goods, automobiles,
and electricity; however, forestry (paper and board) is negatively associated with the dividend payout ratio. In addition, free
cash flow has a positive impact on dividend payment in fixed-line telecommunication, and a negative impact on chemical,
forestry, construction and material, engineering, beverages, tobacco, travel and leisure, food processor, household goods,
pharmaceutical and biotech, and automobiles.

Furthermore, the relationship of dividends has been stud-
ied with other variables too. For instance, Basse and
Reddemann (2011) noted a positive relationship between the
dividends and inflation and hence argued that companies
tend to increase their dividend payments mainly during the
inflationary period. Notably, in the context of Pakistan, it has
been observed that both ownership structure and cash flows
are the main determinants of corporate dividend policy (Afza
& Mirza, 2010), which, in turn, may be used to determine
stock price volatility (PV; Nazir, Nawaz, Anwar, & Ahmed,
2010).
Previously, authors have also emphasized financial man-
agers to look into the significant pattern of dividend pay-
ments (Cheng, Cullinan, & Zhang, 2014). The traditional
notion that the dividend policy may be used to determine the
market value of the company has been criticized by Miller
and Modigliani (1961). In contrast, it is also believed that
earning is the main factor, which sets the mode of dividend
payment behavior (Baker, Sasdi, Dutta, & Gahndi, 2007;
Basse & Reddemann, 2011; John & Muthusamy, 2010;
Ramachandran & Packkirisamy, 2010).
Statement of the Problem
Equity market is considered as the backbone in mounting
funds to build a national economy, whereas a capital market
plays an integral role in mobilizing domestic and foreign
resources so that it could assist stakeholders in making better
financial decisions. It not only serves as the most productive
medium for long-term usage of funds but also eases the pro-
cess of the efficient allocation of resources.
In the context of emerging markets, such as Vietnamese
stock market, the findings of Tran and Nguyen (2014)
revealed the utilizations of the stable dividend policy using
fixed-effect model in the country. Similarly, a few scholars
(e.g., Afza & Mirza, 2010; Ahmed & Javid, 2009) have
studied dividend payment behavior in Karachi Stock
Exchange (KSE), which is the largest capital market of
Pakistan. The equity market of the country was considered
as one of the emerging markets by International Finance
Corporation (IFC) in 1991 whose pace was initially very
slow; however, it was reemerged following the new millen-
nium. Notably, the performance of the equity market was
spectacular till 2004.
In addition, the history of dividend payments could be the
influencing factor for the investors, who intend to initiate
their savings for the mobilization of economic growth. The
determinants that influence dividend payments have been dis-
cussed by different authors (e.g.,Afza & Mirza, 2010;Ahmed
& Javid, 2009; Baker et al., 2007; Basse & Reddemann, 2011;
John & Muthusamy, 2010; Ramachandran & Packkirisamy,
2010). In fact, the nature, characteristics, and efficiency of
dividend policies of emerging markets differ from developed
markets (Manneh & Naser, 2015; Sharma & Pandey, 2014;
Tran & Nguyen, 2014).Although researchers have the similar
views about the nature, characteristics, and efficiency of divi-
dend policies in the developing markets, very little is known
regarding these three facets in the context of emerging mar-
kets. Therefore, it forms the basis of this study to analyze the
determinants of dividend policy behavior in Pakistan.
The contributions of this article are twofold. First, this
study provides a sector-wise analysis of the payment behav-
ior for all 32 sectors operating in KSE for the period 2009
through 2013. Second, it also identifies the relationship
among different dividend payment variables of 15 non-
financial sectors during the aforementioned time period. The
results of this study will help investors visualize the ongoing
trends amid these sectors. Besides, it would also contribute
to the ongoing discussion of factors that influence dividend
payments behavior particularly in the context of an emerging
market. More specifically, the study will help those investors
who mainly plan to rotate their portfolio of investment
opportunities with review to achieve optimum profits.
Review of Empirical Studies
It is observed that dividends are disappearing mostly in the
U.S. market because there is a decreasing trend in the num-
ber of firms paying dividends. Two very common reasons for
this phenomenon include characteristics and tendency of
firms to pay dividends (Fama & French, 2001). According to
catering theory, managers accommodate investors for pay-
ment of dividends when premium on stock price is available
and do not pay when an investor does not have a desire of
dividends (Baker & Wurgler, 2004). Consequently, propen-
sity to pay high dividend depends on dividend premium;
hence, it will be low when negative dividend premium exists.
On the same lines, Abdulkadir, Abdullah, and Wong
(2016) investigated the dividend payment behavior in
Nigeria by taking the data of 126 non-financial firms cover-
ing the period from 2003 to 2012. Dividend payment behav-
ior has been investigated by incorporating clientele, catering,
and life cycle theories using the variables such as dividend
payment (as outcome variable) and foreign, premium,
retained earnings, firm size, return on assets (ROA), invest-
ments (INV), cash flows (CF), leverage (LEV), precious
year dividend, financial crises, stock market performance,
and interest rates (as explanatory variables). Results of panel
logistic regression revealed a decreasing trend of dividend
payment due to an increase in the foreign investments. They
noted that foreign investors have less preferences on receiv-
ing dividends due to the involvement of tax.
Similarly, Duscha et al. (2016) pointed out renewable
energy sources (RES) development, which can show an
important part in European economy up to 2030. The objec-
tive was to increase security, job, and growth opportunities
by reducing the low carbon in the economy. The idea of triple
dividend was used by development of RES in Europe up to
2030. They used detailed techno-economic model and two
macroeconomic models. Results support the expected triple
Khan and Shamim 3
dividend up to 2030 despite a decrease in role of European
economy as a technology provider to the rest of the world.
In addition, Bremberger, Cambini, Gugler, and Rondi (2016)
explained the impact on dividend policy by focusing on differ-
ent regulatory and government-controlled environment. The
panel data were used to check the relationship of dividend pay-
out with cost-based versus incentive-based and state-owned
versus privately owned regulated firms in the European listed
companies. The findings were consistent with the cost-based
regulated firms, which smoothly maintain their dividend policy
as compared with the incentive-based firms. It is also found that
although the government-regulated firms are weak in efficiency,
the shareholders are given an increased amount of importance
while devising the dividend policy.
Besides, Manneh and Naser (2015) studied dividend of
non-financial companies of Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange
(ADX), which is one of the emerging market in Asia. The
study mainly concentrated on manufacturing, services, food,
energy, telecommunications, and property and real estates.
They found a significant and positive relationship between
dividend policy and earnings in ADX. The findings of this
study have been found consistent with agency theory, which
holds that dividend is negatively associated with the leverage.
Furthermore, Sikes and Verrecchia (2015) pointed out the
relationship between dividend tax capitalization and liquidity.
Theoretical analysis showed a positive impact of liquidity mod-
erates dividend taxes on expected rates of return, whereas
empirical analysis was adjusted on Jobs and Growth Tax Relief
and Reconciliation Act of 2003, which minimizes the gap
between maximum statutory dividend and capital gain taxes.
Results also provide evidence to institutional ownerships, which
mitigates the repercussion of taxes on dividend capitalization.
In addition, Javakhadze, Ferris, and Sen (2014) examined
the dividend smoothing globally based on agency model and
the theories that explain the irregular dividend information.
A cross-sectional sample of more than 2,000 firms of 24
countries was drawn, which have less market-to-book ratio
and less cash involvement in larger dividend smoothing. The
analysis of initial outcome emphasized that the firms with
less amount of cash reserves tend to maintain dividend
smoothing. The findings also suggested that ownership con-
centration has a negative impact on dividend smoothing.
Moreover, the governance has shown a negative effect on
dividend payment behavior.
Besides, Sharma and Pandey (2014) constructed a non-
parametric model, which shows dividend payment behavior
of Indian Stock Market. There are no signaling effects of
either increased or decreased dividend found in their study.
However, it is also revealed that due to inefficiencies in the
stock market, adjustments in prices are made once any rele-
vant information is provided to the market.
Similarly, Cheng et al. (2014) provided the evidence of divi-
dend payment behavior of cross-listed companies operating in
the Chinese stock market for the period covering 2003 to 2011.
Free cash flow plays a vital role in the case of cross-listed
companies for distribution of dividend. Results concluded that
cross-listed companies'dividend are normally lower than other
listed companies. It is also found that more responsive dividend
policies of cross-listed companies and the relationship of divi-
dend behavior are considered more volatile with the free cash
flow and development breaks.
In addition, Musiega, Alala, Douglas, Christopher, and
Robert (2013) analyzed the determinants of dividend policy
on Nairobi Stock Exchange for the period 2007 to 2011.
Dividend payout was the dependent variable, whereas profit-
ability, growth, earning, and liquidity were taken as indepen-
dent variables. Moreover, size and risk were used as
moderators. Results showed that return on equity, size, and
growth have a positive impact on dividend payout.
Likewise, Nnadi, Wogboroma, and Kabel (2013) investi-
gated determinants of dividend policy of 29 listed firms in
theAfrican Stock Exchange. By using unit root test and Tobit
regression, the study revealed that government, age, market
capitalization, and earning per share have positive influence
on dividend policy in African listed firms.
Similarly, Al-Ajmi and Hussain (2011) reviewed the corpo-
rate dividend decisions in SaudiArabia by using a sample of 54
Saudi listed firms during 1990 and 2006. The results revealed
that most of the Saudi firms pay small amount of dividends out
of their earnings. It is further reported that fixed dividend policy
are not used by these firms and they tend to change or adjust
their dividend policies according to the amount of earnings they
observe. The authors determined that four factors actually influ-
enced the dividend policy decision in the Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia: (a) more profitability, (b) large firms, (c) firms that paid
dividends in previous period, and (d) the firms occupying rela-
tively fewer investment opportunities.
Moreover, Basse and Reddemann (2011) explained the
inflation and the dividend policy of U.S. firms by using the
quarterly data from 1980 to 2008. Co-integration technique
of long-run relationship was applied on variables including
dividends, corporate earnings, real growth, and inflation.
The results showed that there is a stable long-run relationship
between all these variables and there is also a positive rela-
tionship between the dividends and inflation. The study also
revealed that companies mostly increase their dividend pay-
ments during inflationary environment.
Besides, Abor and Bokpin (2010) evaluated the effect of
corporate finance and investments on dividend policy in 34
countries covering the period from 1990 to 2006. The fixed-
effect panel model was used in the analysis using the vari-
ables such as profitability, leverage, debt, external financing,
and stock market capitalization representing corporate
finance. The results showed that stock market capitalization
and profitability were more significant determinants of divi-
dend policy; however, non-significant impact of leverage,
debt, external financing was recorded on dividend policy.
Besides, the results also revealed that there is a significant
association between investment opportunities and dividend
policy. They concluded that firms that belong to developed
4 SAGE Open
markets are more focused toward paying least possible divi-
dends to their shareholders.
In addition, Nazir et al. (2010) evaluated the role of corpo-
rate dividend policy in determining the stock PV in Pakistan by
using a sample of 73 firms from KSE from 2003 to 2008. The
techniques used were fixed-effect and random-effect regres-
sion, with the test involving PV as dependent variable and divi-
dend yield as independent variable. It is suggested that the
dividend policy have effect of stock PV in Pakistan.
Likewise, John and Muthusamy (2010) investigated the
relationship between leverage, growth, and profitability on
payout ratio in Indian paper industry by using the data of top
10 paper firms listed on Bombay Stock Exchange based on
sales. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression was used and
secondary data were collected from Center of Monitoring
Indian Economy. Growth in sales, earning per share, price
earnings ratio, market-to-book value, cash flow, leverage,
liquidity, and ROA were used as independent variables to
predict dividend payout. Results showed that there is a nega-
tive relationship between leverage and dividend payout.
Similarly, Ramachandran and Packkirisamy (2010) ascer-
tained the impact of firm size on dividend payment behavior
with reference to corporate firms across industrial estates in
India by using a panel data of 73 firms from 1996 to 2007.
Sectors were selected including cement, chemical, and fertil-
izer, information technology, oil and gas, pharmaceutical,
shipping, and textile. The variables used were capital struc-
ture, dividend payout, and dividend per share. It is reported
that dividend per share of different sizes of firms in India is
dependent on the level of debt and capital structure.
In addition, Afza and Mirza (2010) pointed out the owner-
ship structure and cash flows as determinants of corporate
dividend policy in Pakistan by using the data of 100 listed
companies in KSE from 2005 to 2007. OLS regression was
used to assess the impact of firm size, management, lever-
age, and profitability on dividend payout and its intensity.
The results showed that a negative relationship between the
managerial ownership, cash flow sensitivity, firm size, and
leverage; however, a positive relationship exists between
operating cash flow and profitability with the cash dividend.
Likewise, Al-Kuwari (2010) determined different factors
that influenced the corporate dividend payout decision of firms
listed on Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states by using the
panel data of 191 non-financial firms from 1999 to 2003.
Radom effects Probit model was used to analyze the impact of
government ownership, free cash flow, market capitalization,
growth rate, firm leverage, business risk, and firm profitability
on dividend payout ratio. The results revealed that the govern-
ment ownership, company profitability, and company size
could be significant predictors of paying dividends.The authors
also concluded that payment of dividend may help reduce
agency conflicts, save the minority interests, and increase the
good reputation of firms in the market.
Besides, Fargher and Weigand (2009) compared the
cross-sectional differences between profits, risk of volatile
market-to-book value ratio, and returns before and after the
initiating regular cash dividend payments for the period
commencing from 1964 to 2000. OLS regression was applied
in the study. It included different variables such as return on
equity, ROA, market-to-book value, market capitalization,
debt to asset and profit margin. The results suggested that the
payment of dividends is mainly distributed by those firms
that are at their maturity stage of life cycle.
Similarly, Ferris et al. (2009) carried out an international
analysis of dividend payment behavior by using the sample of
25 countries (nine common law and 16 civil law) from 1994 to
2007. The methodology used a logistic regression model. The
results of both common and civil law regimes showed a
decreasing trend; however, there was an increasing trend in
percentage of non-dividend paying firms. It was, therefore,
suggested that a decline in the payment of dividend can affect
shareholders'primacy and initial faith on governance.
In addition, Ahmed and Javid (2009) investigated the
determinants of dividend policy in Pakistan by using a sam-
ple of 320 non-financial firms listed in KSE from 2001 to
2006. Two parameters Lintner model was used to assess the
dividend policy. The results showed that majority of the
listed non-financial firms set their dividend policy on the
basis of current earnings and dividend per share because both
investment opportunity and leverage have inverse relation-
ship on firms' dividend policy.
Finally,Al-Malkawi (2008) examined the factors influencing
corporate dividend policy decision of publicly quoted companies
in Jordan.AProbit model was used to investigate a sample of 15
years' panel data from 1989 to 2003 of 1,137 firms. The results
concluded that the firm size, profitability, and the age of the firm
are the major factors in making dividend policy decisions.
Notably, the study also revealed a negative impact of financial
leverage in making dividend policy decisions.
Variable Characteristic in the Expectant of
Observed Literature
Dividend payout (DP). It is a ratio that measures the relation-
ship between the earnings belonging to the ordinary share-
holders and the dividend paid to them. It is calculated as
dividend paid to shareholders divided by net profit after tax
available to equity holders. Dividend payout ratio is used in
most of the studies to determine the dividend payment per-
formance for future (Afza & Mirza, 2010; Al-Kuwari, 2010;
John & Muthusamy, 2010; Musiega et al., 2013; Ramachan-
dran & Packkirisamy, 2010).
Growth in sales (GS). It is the amount of increased sales as com-
pared with the previous year. When firms need to increase their
sales in future, more funds are needed to finance the level of
inventory and cost of goods sold. Therefore, firms have to retain
their earnings and cut down the dividend payment (Holder, Lan-
grehr, & Hexter, 1998; Jensen, 1986). Sales growth has a direct
relationship with the payment of dividends.As the sales increase
in future, payout may also increase.
Khan and Shamim 5
Hypothesis 1: Growth in sales has a significant impact on
the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.
Earnings per share (EPS). It measures the profit available to
the equity shareholders on a per share basis, or the amount
that they can get on every share held. It is calculated by
dividing the profits available to the equity shareholders by
the number of the outstanding shares. The financial literature
provides evidence that there is an increase in dividend pay-
out when earnings per share increase (Ahmed & Javid, 2009;
Al-Ajmi & Hussain, 2011; Nnadi et al., 2013).
Hypothesis 2: Earning per share has a significant impact
on the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.
Leverage (LEV). It is the employment of an asset or source of
finance for which a firm pays fixed cost or fixed return.
There are many studies available that identify a negative
relationship between dividend payout and leverage (Ahmed
& Javid, 2009; John & Muthusamy, 2010; Ramachandran &
Packkirisamy, 2010). When firms have to pay fixed amount
of cost, then it is seen that dividend payout declines as a
result of interest cost payment.
Hypothesis 3: Leverage has a significant impact on the
dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.
Free cash flow (FCF). It represents the cash available for payment
of dividend and other future business expansion, and is calcu-
lated from operating cash flow after subtracting capital expendi-
ture. It represents the cash that a company is able to generate
after laying out the money required to maintain or expand its
asset base. For payment of dividend, it is very important for the
firm to hold free cash flow and it has a significant relationship
with the dividend payout (Afza & Mirza, 2010; Fairchild, 2010).
Hypothesis 4: Free cash flow has a significant impact on
the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.
Return on equity (ROE). Return on equity is the measure of
the profitability and an important explanatory variable
according to many previous studies (Fama & French, 2001;
Fargher & Weigand, 2009; Musiega et al., 2013). It is the
ratio of net profit and shareholders' equity. It is used as the
proxy of profitability in most of the situations.
Hypothesis 5: Return on equity has a significant impact
on the dividend payout on the companies listed in KSE.
Data and Method
Ferris et al. (2009) conducted an international analysis of
dividend payment behavior by using the sample of 25
countries (nine common law and 16 civil law) data from
1994 to 2007. Similarly, the purpose of this study is to
analyze the sector-wise dividend payment behavior of
KSE-listed companies. The sample period of this analysis
is extended from 2009 to 2013. Secondary data have been
taken from KSE website and State Bank library/website.
For achieving the objectives, this study is divided into two
parts. In the first part of the study, data have been taken
from all the 32 sectors (financial and non-financial) listed
in KSE during the period 2009 to 2013. More specifically,
a sample of 475 and 505 listed companies have been
drawn from 2009 to 2013, respectively, to analyze the
dividend payment behavior among all the 32 sectors. The
major reason of taking data from 2009 to 2013 is the avail-
ability of complete data set.
In the second part of analysis, data of 21 non-financial
sectors were used to find correlation between dependent
and independent variables. The reason of elimination of
financial firms is the regulation of these firms is very dif-
ferent from non-financial firms, which may affect our
results. Then, we exclude six sectors from the sample
because some of the sectors have too few firms with the
availability of data to allow the statistical technique.
Finally, pooled ordinary lest square (POLS) is used for
analyzing 15 non-financial sectors for the period 2009 to
2013. Model and variables used in this research were divi-
dend payout (DP) as depended variable and growth in sale
(GS), earning per share (EPS), leverage (LEV), free cash
flow (FCF), and return of equity (ROE) as independent
variables.

Data Analysis
Data analysis section is divided in two parts. In the first
part, descriptive analysis provides behavior of all sectors
of KSE for the analysis of sector-wise behavior after the
financial crisis during the period 2009 to 2013. In the sec-
ond part, a complete explanatory research is carried out by
using the POLS applied on 15 sectors on 5 years' data
(from 2009 to 2013) to check the significance of the
variables.
Descriptive Analysis
In first part of this study of sectoral analysis, initially all 33
sectors of KSE had been selected, but one sector data were
not available; therefore, it was excluded from our list. The
data ranging from 475 to 505 companies were obtained from
daily quotation of KSE website from 2009 to 2013. Our
selected sectors were oil and gas, chemicals, forestry and
paper, industrial metal and mining, construction and materi-
als, general industrial, electronics and electrical equipment,
industrial engineering, industrial transportation, support ser-
vices, automobile and parts, beverages, food producers,
households goods, leisure goods, personal goods, tobacco,
health care equipment and services, pharma and biotech,
media, travel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication,
electricity, gas water and multiutilities, banks, non-life insur-
ance, life insurance, real estate investment and services,
financial services, equity investment instruments, software
and computer services, and, finally, technology hardware
and equipment. In 2009 and 2010, the number of companies
were 475.
Table 1 shows sectoral analysis for all 32 sectors in terms
of dividend paid or not paid. In 2009, the numbers of dividend
payers were 202, which is 43% of the total 475 companies.
Similarly, in 2010, numbers of dividend payers were increased
to 273, which is 58% of the total 475 companies. This increase
occurred mainly in personal goods sector, which in 2009 had
44 companies, whereas in 2010, it was increased to 80 com-
panies out of total 122 companies. Personal goods sector rep-
resents textile base companies, which is one of the major
sectors of Pakistan in terms of number of firms. It is the sec-
ond largest manufacturing industry that contributes 8.5% of
GDP. Therefore, an increasing trend has been observed in
2010. Non-life insurance sector also increased from 11 to 17
companies in 2009 to 2010, respectively. In equity investment
instruments, the same tendency was seen and it was increased
from 11 to 31 companies. In the third column, we analyze the
percentage changes of dividend payers in 2010. Increasing
trend is observed in nine sectors: 33% in industrial metals and
mining, 20% in general industries, 82% in personal goods,
12% in food producers, 33% in fixed-line telecommunica-
tion, 18% in banks, 55% in non-life insurance, 75% in finan-
cial services, and 182% in equity investment instruments.
Pakistan is a developing economy and an increasing trend in
industrial metals and mining provides sustainable future
growth. An increase in general industries is the continuous
need of industrial metals for manufacturing support of the
country. Increasing demand of technology and cable facility
during the last decade was quite remarkable, which boasted
this sector, and as a result, the investment amount increased
and the payment of dividend has also increased. Expend of
economic services has boasted the financial sector of Pakistan,
as compared with the past several years. Increasing the num-
ber of banks in private sector is the root cause of increase in
investment in this sector, which increased dividend payment.
Increase in equity instrument shows the investor behavior of
individuals and firms toward the maximization of their long-
term wealth. The main implications of increase in nine sectors
are inter-linked with one and another. This would bring it
closer to the investors for making investment decisions.
There is also a decreasing trend in five sectors, which
include 20% in construction and materials, 29% in industrial
engineering, 100% in support services, 10% in automobiles
and parts, and 20% in household goods. In the last column,
the total percentage of dividend payers is given on the basis
of total number of companies in each sector, and then the
changes in 2009 to 2010 have been taken.
In 2010 and 2011, the number of companies increased
from 475 to 484, with major increase in the personal goods
sector. Table 2 shows that in 2010, the number of dividend
payers was 273, which is 58% of the total 475 companies. In
2011, the number of dividend payers remained almost the
same at 272, which is 56% of the total 484 companies. There
were multiple factors of this result. Oil and gas sector
increased from nine to 12 companies in the period 2010 and
2011. The construction and materials increased from four to
10 companies, and personal goods decreased from 80 to 70
companies during the period 2010 to 2011. In the third col-
umn, the percentage changes of dividend payers in 2011
have been given. There is no major difference in the overall
percentage change. Increasing trend is observed in eight sec-
tors, which include 33% in oil and gas, 6% in chemicals,
150% in construction and material, 29% in Pharma and bio-
tech, 100% in media, 17% in electricity, 23% in banks, and
12% in non-life insurance. There is also a decreasing trend in
10 sectors, including 20% in industrial engineering, 7% in
food producers, 13% in personal goods, 50% in tobacco,
25% in fixed-line telecommunication, 33% in life insurance,
14% in financial services, 3% in equity investment instru-
ment, 100% in software and computers services, and 25% in
household goods. In the last column, the total percentage of
dividend payers on the basis of total number of companies in
each sector has been described, and then the changes in 2010
to 2011 have been taken.
In 2012, the number of companies was 505, which was
mainly due to personal goods sector. Dividend paying com-
panies were 211, which was fairly due to decreased in almost
all sectors including oil and gas, 25%; chemical, 28%; indus-
trial material and mining, 25%; construction and material,

tion, 67%; banks, 38%; non-life insurance, 68%; and life

In 2013, total number of companies was 494, of which
224 companies paid dividend. It was a minor increase as
compared with 2012 (211 companies). Major increase was
noticed in different industries, for example, general indus-
tries, fixed-line telecommunication, and life insurance
accounted for 40%, 200%, and 200%, respectively.
Unit Root Test for 15 Sectors
The panel unit root test procedure used to check stationary of
the data. This procedure emphasizes the development of
combined information from the time-series dimension with
that obtained from the cross-sectional dimension, in the hope
of making inferences about the existence of unit roots.
In analysis of all sectors, results of Table 3 clearly show
all the variables are stationary at first difference, which sug-
gests there is a long-term relationship in the series of
variables.
After applying stationary test, now data can be analyzed
by applying pooled ordinary lest square (POLS) test to check
the significance of the model that is developed in the "Data
and Method" section.
Estimation for POLS
Results are shown in Table 4. Variables are used to find the
relationship among all the sectors with EPS, ROE, GS, LEV,
and FCF as independent variables and DP as a dependent
variable.
Earnings per share. The results of Table 4 show the EPS has
a positive significant impact on DP in beverages, travel and
leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food processors,
household goods, personal goods, automobiles, and electric-
ity. This happens when the earnings are increasing and com-
panies want to distribute these earnings to shareholders,
whereas forestry (paper and based) has a negative significant
relationship with the dividend payout ratio. Earnings per
share are generally considered to be the single most impor-
tant variable in determining a share's price. This happens due
to retention of earnings. It happens, when companies are in
growing face, and the procedure of residual dividend policy
is a very common phenomenon, in which first companies
cover their capital expenditure and then remaining amount
would be paid as dividend.
Return on equity. The results of Table 4 show that ROE has
significant positive relationship with DP in chemical, for-
estry, and tobacco sectors (Afza & Mirza, 2010). ROE is the
measure of profit; therefore, an increase in the return will
cause result to increase in dividend payment. ROE has a neg-
ative significant relationship with the DP in oil and gas, con-
struction and materials, engineering, beverages, travel and
leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, household goods, per-
sonal goods, pharma and biotech, and electricity. ROE is the
measure of profit and growth. Benefits of profit come from
re-investment in the company, which will give high growth
rate in future to investors.
Growth sales. The results of Table 4 show that GS has posi-
tive significant impact on DP in oil and gas, construction and
materials, engineering, and household goods. Increase in the
sales as compared with previous year causes the result to
increase in profitability and, as a consequence, would ulti-
mately increase dividend payment, but chemical, forestry,
and food producer have a negative significant relationship
with the dividend payout ratio. This result shows that com-
pany has not been distributing their earnings even if sales are
growing. A company's market share has a big force on its
future growth in sales. Sometimes companies want to
increase market share, and for this purpose, retaining of earn-
ings is very important.
Leverage.The results of Table 4 show that leverage have a
positive significant relationship with DP in forestry, tobacco,
travel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food pro-
cessor, and personal goods. This result is also apparent when
companies obtain debt to purchase fixed assets or sometimes
total business to increase or diversify in the market. This
leads to an increase in stock prices, and in such a situation,
companies have to pay dividend, but oil and gas, household
goods, and pharma and biotech have a negative significant
relationship with the dividend payout ratio (Afza & Mirza,
2010; Ahmed & Javid, 2009; Al-Kuwari, 2010; John &
Muthusamy, 2010). It shows as the level of debt or total debt
increases in the firm's capital structure, it may cause deceas-
ing trend in the dividend payment. This phenomenon occurs
due to an increase in the amount of interest payment; there-
fore, leverage may cause a decrease in DP.
Free cash flow. The results of Table 4 show free cash flow has
a positive significant relationship with DP in fixed line. The
presence of free cash flow is a healthy sign, which indicates
that a company has cash for payment of dividends. If a com-
pany has a large amount of earnings, but does not have cash,
then it will not be able to pay dividends to shareholders.
Likewise, chemical, forestry, construction and material,
engineering, beverages, tobacco, travel and leisure, food pro-
cessor, household goods, pharma and biotech, and automo-
biles have a negative significant relationship with the
dividend payout ratio. A negative relationship of free cash
flow shows that companies put most of their cash into invest-
ment opportunities. This happens when a firm is in liquidity
crunch, and needs to purchase inventory and additional
working capital for expending credit to customers.

Conclusion and Recommendations
This study investigates the factors that influence dividend
payment behavior in KSE by using annual panel data from
the period 2009 to 2013. First, descriptive analysis used to
provide the sector-wise behavior of dividend payment and
non-payment. In the second part of analysis, Augmented
Dickey Fuller (ADF) conventional panel unit root test and
panel OLS techniques were used. DP was used as a depen-
dent variable and EPS, FCF, GS, LEV, and ROE were used
as independent variables.
Results show that EPS has a positive impact on DP in
eight sectors (beverages, travel and leisure, fixed-line tele-
communication, food processors, household goods, personal
goods, automobiles, and electricity), whereas forestry (paper
and board) has a negative significant relationship with the
dividend payout ratio. Besides, FCF has positive impact on
DP in only one sector (fixed-line telecommunication),
whereas chemical, forestry, construction and material, engi-
neering, beverages, tobacco, travel and leisure, food proces-
sor, household goods, pharma and biotech, and automobiles
have a negative impact on DP.
Similarly, GS in sales has a positive impact on DP in four
sectors (oil and gas, construction and material, engineering,
household goods); however, chemical, forestry, and food
processor have negative impact on DP. In addition, LEV has
a positive impact on DP in six sectors (forestry, tobacco,
travel and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, food pro-
cessor, and personal goods), whereas oil and gas, household
goods, and pharma and biotech have a negative impact on
DP. Moreover, ROE also has a positive impact on DP in three
sectors (chemical, forestry, and tobacco); however, oil and
gas, construction and material, engineering, beverages, travel
and leisure, fixed-line telecommunication, household goods,
personal goods, pharma and biotech, and electricity have a
negative impact on DP.
It is observed that dividend payment behavior has impor-
tant connections and transformations among the sectors.
Mostly, once a company starts paying dividend, it looks
forward to continue this practice. Results document a few
characteristics related to the ability to pay dividends among
firms based on the profitability, riskiness, and life cycle.
The differences that do occur are related to size and growth
opportunities.
It can be recommended that firms should focus on its
internal policies as all factors that are part of the study relate
to the internal financial strength of the firm and most of them
are found to be more or less effective. It is also recommended
to the managers of the firms to consider external factors
when they decide dividend policy. Without considering
external factors and characteristics of the firms, making a
dividend decision will be imprudent. Investors who desire
dividend but not high dividend may focus on either paying or
non-paying dividend firms. In contrast, those who desire
high dividend should focus on factors that affect payment of
dividend. It is also suggested to the policy makers that corpo-
rate-level policies have an important impact on liberalization
of the stock market. Decreasing the trend of dividend pay-
ment may attract the other type of investment opportunities,
such as an increase of the foreign investors to channeling of
extra funds. At the same time, local investors may be irate
with non-payment of the desired level of dividend. Therefore,
it is suggested to the policy makers to protect the interest of
the domestic investors. A higher level of cash flow is desired,
so its maintenance should also be done by taking all neces-
sary measures. Net income is the core reason of all business
activities, and it should be given importance because it
increases earning per share of the firms. Effective internal
management that can help in increasing sales growth should
be hired, which will make firms more rewarding for the
investors who mostly take their decisions after considering
dividend payouts of previous years.
Even though the objective of this study more or less has
been achieved, there are certain limitations that need to be
addressed. First, due to unavailability of data, sample size is
restricted to 5 years (2009-2013) only. Therefore, it is diffi-
cult to generalize the results completely. Second, as it is an
empirical research, this study is limited to measure and use
because environmental properties may affect the results.
Further research can be done by considering financial sec-
tors, which are also being considered by investors while tak-
ing their investment decisions. Dividend payouts has been
used as dependent variable and it is considered as one of the
most dependable factors by the investors, but there are other
factors that would have been considered by the investors,
which can be used for future research, such as corporate gov-
ernance and internal management.
