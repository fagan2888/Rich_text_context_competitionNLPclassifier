Abstract
BACKGROUND
A substantial number of young women experience pregnancy scares ­ thinking they
might be pregnant, and later discovering that they are not. Although pregnancy scares
are distressing events, little is known about who experiences them and whether they are
important to our understanding of unintended pregnancy.
OBJECTIVE
We describe the young women who experience pregnancy scares, and examine the link
between pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy.
METHODS
We used data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life Study. T-tests and
regression analyses were conducted using baseline and weekly data to estimate
relationships between respondent characteristics and subsequent pregnancy scares.
Event history methods were used to assess pregnancy scares as a predictor of
unintended pregnancy.
RESULTS
Nine percent of the young women experienced a pregnancy scare during the study.
African-American race, lack of two-parent family structure, lower GPA, cohabitation,
and sex without birth control prior to the study are associated with experiencing a
pregnancy scare and with experiencing a greater number of pregnancy scares. Further,
experiencing a pregnancy scare is strongly associated with subsequent unintended
pregnancy, independent of background factors. Forty percent of the women who
experienced a pregnancy scare subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the
study period, relative to only 11% of those who did not experience a pregnancy scare.

CONCLUSIONS
Young women from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a
pregnancy scare, and pregnancy scares are often followed by an unintended pregnancy.
1. Introduction
In the United States, the term `pregnancy scare' describes when a woman who wants to
avoid pregnancy believes she is pregnant, but later learns that she is not. For example,
as one respondent (who did not desire a pregnancy) told us shortly after her pregnancy
scare, "I thought there could have been a chance that I was pregnant but it turned out
that I wasn't, so I am very thankful for that." Many respondents reported, "I missed this
month's period," or "My period started seven days late" to explain why they
temporarily thought they were pregnant.
Pregnancy scares are common ­ over half of the young women (54%) who
participated in a recent survey conducted by the National Campaign to Prevent Teen
and Unplanned Pregnancy (2013) reported that they had had a pregnancy scare. In the
Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation's National Survey of Adolescents and Young
Adults, 3 in 5 respondents reported that they or their female partner had ever
experienced a pregnancy scare (Hoff, Greene, and Davis 2003). Relatively little is
known about pregnancy scares and their consequences.
Our first objective is to describe the young women who experience pregnancy
scares. We hypothesize that disadvantaged sociodemographic background
characteristics and early experiences with sex, lack of contraception, and pregnancy
will be associated with pregnancy scares, much as they are associated with unintended
pregnancy.
Our second objective is to examine the link between pregnancy scares and
subsequent unintended pregnancy. A pregnancy scare may be an indicator that a young
woman is at high risk of an unintended pregnancy, for several reasons. First, adjustment
to the idea of a possible pregnancy might introduce some ambivalence into a young
woman's desire to avoid pregnancy. This can occur after a miscarriage of an unintended
pregnancy. As one respondent told us, "I found out I was pregnant and I miscarried. I
didn't know that I wanted a baby until I lost it. That is why part of me wants to get
pregnant now. I'm not trying to but I would be happy if I did." If pregnancy scares
affect pregnancy desire, or ambivalence about pregnancy, in a similar way, then
pregnancy scares will have a direct effect on the likelihood of experiencing a later
pregnancy. Second, for imperfect contraceptors, a pregnancy scare is likely to precede
an actual unintended pregnancy, because the average pregnancy rate for any given
Demographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40
http://www.demographic-research.org 1231
month is only about 50% for young women even when sex is perfectly timed to
ovulation (Dunson, Colombo, and Baird 2002). Third, personality traits or skills that
lead to pregnancy scares may predict unintended pregnancy as well ­ for example, the
ability to consistently adhere to a contraception regimen.
2. Methods
We use data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study, which
interviewed a random, population-based sample of 1,003 young women ages 18-19,
residing in a Michigan county. Women were selected from the state driver's license and
personal identification card databases. Investigators conducted a 60-minute face-to-face
baseline survey between March 2008 and July 2009. Women then participated in a 2.5-
year follow-up study that required completion of weekly online or telephone surveys
about contraceptive use, relationships, and prospective pregnancy intentions. In this
paper we refer to the follow-up study as "the journal," and the weekly surveys as
"journals". The follow-up study concluded in February 2012. The response rate for the
baseline interview was 84%, 99% agreed to participate in the journal, and 75%
participated in the journal for at least 18 months.
In this study we use only the first 18 months of the journal data to minimize bias
from attrition. We analyze the weeks in which the respondent was not pregnant and did
not strongly desire a pregnancy. We use two questions from the weekly surveys that
measured pregnancy desires to identify those weeks. The first question asked
respondents how much they wanted to get pregnant during the next month. The second
question asked respondents how much they wanted to avoid getting pregnant during the
next month. Both questions used a response scale from 0 to 5. Figure 1 summarizes the
combined responses to these two questions, which we describe as strong antinatal,
moderate antinatal, ambivalent/indifferent/moderate pronatal, and strong pronatal. The
design of these measures and how they relate to subsequent pregnancy have been
described elsewhere (Miller, Barber, and Gatny 2013). In this study we omit weeks
classified as strong pronatal in Figure 1. The result is an analytic sample of 901 young
women and 34,943 observations.

pregnancy desires
2.1 Measures
Outcomes. Each week, respondents were asked about their pregnancy status, and are
coded as "not pregnant," "probably pregnant," or "pregnant." "Pregnant" is defined as a
self-report of a positive pregnancy test. Of the 901 young women in our analytic
sample, 114 (13%) reported 126 unintended pregnancies during the 18-month study
period. Table 1 summarizes these statistics. Of those women who experienced an
unintended pregnancy during the study, 89% reported only one and 11% reported two.

Because we are analyzing only weeks in which respondents do not desire
pregnancy, any "probably pregnant" report that is not subsequently verified by a
pregnancy test (or, eventually, a birth, miscarriage, or abortion) is considered a
"pregnancy scare". Descriptive statistics of these measures are also presented in Table
1. Of the 901 women in our analytic sample, 85 women (9%) reported 114 pregnancy
scares during the 18-month study period. The majority reported only one pregnancy
scare (78%), but a substantial proportion reported two (13%), and even three or four
scares (9%). Of the 126 unintended pregnancies, 26 (21%) were preceded by a
pregnancy scare within the study period, and among the 85 women who reported a
pregnancy scare, 34 (40%) subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the study
(not shown in tables). Among the 816 women in our analytic sample who did not report
a pregnancy scare, only 88 (11%) subsequently had an unintended pregnancy during the
study (not shown in tables).
Sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent pregnancy-related experiences.
We include characteristics measured in the baseline interview, summarized in Table 2.
All of these variables are dichotomous, except high school GPA, which is continuous.
Currently receiving public assistance includes WIC (Women, Infants and Children
Program), FIP (Family Independence Program), cash welfare, or food stamps.
Other indicators. In regression models we use the total number of journals
completed to control for repeated observation and exposure time. And, in hazard
models, we include respondents' time in study, time in study squared, and total number
of journals completed, to control for the increasing hazard of pregnancy and repeated
Gatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy
1234 http://www.demographic-research.org
observations. Time in study is coded in months and ranges from 0.49 to 18 months,
with a mean of 8.60 months.
2.2 Data analysis
First we calculate the descriptive statistics for all independent variables for the total
sample, as well as two subsamples: those who never experienced a pregnancy scare,
and those who experienced a pregnancy scare (Table 2). Independent samples' t-tests
indicate whether the independent variables are statistically different in the two
subsamples. Next we investigate these characteristics in a multivariate context, using
logistic regression for models of experiencing any pregnancy scare, and Poisson
regression for models of the number of pregnancy scares (Table 3). Lastly, we estimate
hazard models, implemented using logistic regression, to illustrate the relationship
between a pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy (Table 4). All
analyses were conducted in Stata 12.1 using the logit, poisson, and xtlogit commands.
The hazard models were estimated with xtlogit to account for the clustering effect of
multiple journals per respondent.
3. Results
3.1 Characteristics of respondents who had a pregnancy scare
Table 2 shows that, overall, sociodemographic characteristics associated with
disadvantage are overrepresented in the subsample of young women who experienced a
pregnancy scare. For example, while only 32% of those who did not experience a
pregnancy scare are African American, 54% of those who experienced a pregnancy
scare are African American. Also, young women with early pregnancy-related
experiences are overrepresented in the pregnancy scares subsample.

3.2 Multivariate models of experiencing a pregnancy scare
The results in Table 3 are similar to the bivariate results presented in Table 2, although
some of the associations are not statistically significant in the multivariate models.
Further, the results are quite similar across specifications ­ characteristics associated
with the probability of experiencing a pregnancy scare are also associated with the
number of pregnancy scares actually reported, with only minor differences.
Column 1 shows that young women who are African-American, did not have a
two-parent family structure, had a lower GPA in high school, and/or were living with a
partner had higher probability of a pregnancy scare. In addition, young women who had
had sex without birth control in the past had marginally higher probability of a
pregnancy scare.

Column 2 shows that these same individual characteristics are also associated with
a larger number of pregnancy scares. In addition, young women with two or more
sexual partners experienced a marginally higher number of pregnancy scares than their
peers. This suggests that women who had multiple sexual partners are
Demographic Research: Volume 31, Article 40
http://www.demographic-research.org 1237
disproportionately represented in the group that experienced multiple pregnancy scares.
In these multivariate regression models, having had sex without birth control is the only
adolescent pregnancy-related experience strongly related to pregnancy scares. Recall
that in the bivariate models, on the other hand, early sex, multiple partners, prior sex
without birth control, and one or more prior pregnancies are strongly related to
pregnancy scares. This suggests that early sex, multiple sexual partners, and prior
pregnancy are associated with pregnancy scares largely because of the
sociodemographic characteristics of those young women who have early sex, multiple
partners, and teen pregnancies, or because of their association with having sex without
birth control. This is consistent with existing research; for example, finding that early
sexual debut is associated with less contraceptive use (Kusunoki and Upchurch 2011;
Manning, Longmore, and Giordano 2000; Manlove, Ryan, and Franzetta 2007). Note
also that respondents who completed more journals were more likely to report a
pregnancy scare, likely in part because it is associated with more time in the study
period.
3.3 Multivariate models of the hazard of experiencing an unintended pregnancy
Finally, in Table 4 we estimate hazard models to illustrate the relationship between a
pregnancy scare and subsequent unintended pregnancy rates. Model 1 includes only the
control variables and shows higher unintended pregnancy rates among young African
American women, those whose mothers had their first birth as a teen, those with a
lower high school GPA, those receiving public assistance, and those living with a
romantic partner. In terms of respondents' prior experiences, unintended pregnancy
rates are higher among those who had sexual intercourse at or before age 16, had two or
more sexual partners during adolescence, and/or had an adolescent pregnancy. In
addition, the time variables are significant ­ the risk of unintended pregnancy increases
throughout most of the study period, but then declines slightly near the end (indicated
by the small negative coefficient for the variable indicating squared months in the
study). Respondents who completed more journals during the study also had a lower
hazard of unintended pregnancy. Note that because total number of journals completed
is net of time in the study in these models, the negative coefficient likely represents the
type of respondent who completed many journals within a specific period. Thus, the
negative association is due to characteristics that lead respondents to complete more
journals and also reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy, for example,
conscientiousness.

Model 2 shows that young women who experienced a pregnancy scare had higher
subsequent unintended pregnancy rates than those respondents who did not. More
precisely, the weekly log-odds of experiencing an unintended pregnancy were 99%
higher, which translates into nearly double the unintended pregnancy rate for women
who had a prior pregnancy scare compared to those who did not.
Model 3 indicates higher unintended pregnancy rates after a pregnancy scare even
when measures of sociodemographic characteristics are included as controls. In other
words, although women from disadvantaged backgrounds experience more pregnancy
scares and higher unintended pregnancy rates, young women who experience a
pregnancy scare have higher unintended pregnancy rates than their peers without a
pregnancy scare, net of their disadvantaged background. However, the fact that the
magnitude of the pregnancy scare effect declines by 20% between models 2 and 3
indicates that pregnancy scares are associated with unintended pregnancy in part
because of the sociodemographic characteristics linked to both experiences.
The adolescent pregnancy-related experiences added to Model 4 explain an
additional 6% of the relationship between pregnancy scares and unintended pregnancy,
but the coefficient remains large and statistically significant. Although adolescent
experiences with early sex and multiple partners are strongly related to the rate of
unintended pregnancy, for the most part they do not explain the difference in
unintended pregnancy rates between young women who experienced pregnancy scares
and those who did not.
4. Discussion
We found that a substantial proportion (9%) of young women experienced a pregnancy
scare during the 18-month study period. A wide range of sociodemographic
characteristics and adolescent experiences were associated with pregnancy scares in our
bivariate analyses. However, in our multivariate analyses, only being African-
American, growing up with something other than a two-parent family structure, having
a lower high school GPA, living with a romantic partner, and having sex without birth
control during adolescence were independently associated with a higher probability of a
pregnancy scare. We found similar results when we predicted number of pregnancy
scares. This suggests that although pregnancy scares occur to all types of young
women, those from less advantaged backgrounds are more likely to experience a
pregnancy scare than those from more advantaged backgrounds.
We found that 21% of the unintended pregnancies were preceded by a pregnancy
scare within the study period, and ­ even more dramatic ­ more than 40% of women
who reported a pregnancy scare went on to experience an unintended pregnancy, even
Gatny, Kusunoki & Barber: Pregnancy scares and subsequent unintended pregnancy
1240 http://www.demographic-research.org
during the relatively limited period of observation in our study (18 months). In our
hazard models, pregnancy scares are a strong predictor of unintended pregnancy,
independent of key sociodemographic characteristics and adolescent experiences. In
other words, young women who experience a pregnancy scare have higher unintended
pregnancy rates than those who do not, regardless of their background. This suggests
that pregnancy scares may be a harbinger of a future unintended pregnancy.
It is beyond the scope of the current study to discern the mechanisms that explain
why pregnancy scares are followed by unintended pregnancies, but future research
should examine whether young women's attitudes or behaviors change after this
experience. Of course, we cannot rule out that other unknown or unmeasured factors
associated with unintended pregnancy are captured by pregnancy scares. But even if
this is the case, a pregnancy scare could mark an important point for intervention.
The study has several limitations. The single county sample design may decrease
the generalizability of the results. The sample does, however, hold constant the
geographic differences in pregnancy scares and/or unintended pregnancy rates, as well
as the geographic factors (e.g., media, policy, etc.) that are not a focus in this study. The
very few Latinas in the county, and in our sample, precludes assessing them as a
separate category. Research has estimated that other surveys capture only about one-
half of abortions (Jones and Kost 2007). Thus, unintended pregnancies that end in
abortion are likely underrepresented in our analyses.
Finally, although we measure pregnancy desires prospectively with two unipolar
scales, this measurement does not fully capture the range of emotions surrounding
pregnancy. We also use a broad definition of "unintended" in this analysis ­ we
consider all pregnancies that were not fully intended (i.e., strong desire to get pregnant
and no desire to avoid pregnancy) to be unintended. Our goal in this analysis was not to
develop a complex measure of the intention status of pregnancies or pregnancy scares,
but rather to limit our analyses to time periods when young women were not
specifically trying to become pregnant.
5. Conclusions
Our research describes the young women who have pregnancy scares ­ information we
must have for reducing the incidence of these distressing events. In addition, we find
that pregnancy scares often precede unintended pregnancies. Asking young women
whether they have ever had a pregnancy scare is a simple and straightforward way to
assess pregnancy risk, and may help clinicians gauge how effectively young women are
using their chosen contraceptive method.
