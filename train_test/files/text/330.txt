Background and Purpose--Few population-based studies have examined the relationship between dietary intake of folate
and risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease (CVD). This study examines the association between dietary intake of
folate and the subsequent risk of stroke and CVD.
Methods--Study participants included 9764 US men and women aged 25 to 74 years who participated in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) and were free of CVD at baseline.
Dietary intake of folate was assessed at baseline using a 24-hour dietary recall and calculated using ESHA software.
Incidence data for stroke and CVD were obtained from medical records and death certificates.
Results--Over an average of 19 years of follow-up, 926 incident stroke events and 3758 incident CVD events were
documented. The relative risk (RR) was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63 to 0.99, P0.03 for trend) for incident
stroke events and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78 to 0.95, P0.001 for trend) for incident CVD events in the highest quartile of
dietary folate intake (median, 405.0 g/day) compared with those in the lowest quartile (median, 99.0 g/day), after
adjustment for established cardiovascular risk factors and dietary factors.
Conclusions--Our findings indicate an inverse relationship between dietary intake of folate and subsequent risk of stroke
and CVD. Increasing dietary intake of folate from food sources may be an important approach to the prevention of CVD
in the US population. (Stroke. 2002;33:1183-1189.)

As early as 1969, homocysteine was hypothesized to
affect atherosclerotic processes.1 Since that time, sub-
stantial evidence has accumulated linking homocysteine in
plasma and serum to the risk of cardiovascular diseases.2­5
Folate and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12
) are important reg-
ulators of the metabolism of homocysteine in the body, and
studies have shown an inverse relationship between levels of
these factors and levels of homocysteine in the blood.6­8 In
addition, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that
folate supplementation reduces blood levels of
homocysteine.9,10
Epidemiological studies have also identified an inverse
relationship between blood concentrations of folate and
cardiovascular disease end points, including stroke.11­13 How-
ever, few studies have prospectively examined the relation-
ship between dietary intake of folate and the risk of cardio-
vascular diseases.14 To our knowledge, no previous
prospective study has reported a significant relationship
between dietary intake of folate and the risk of stroke.
The importance of examining the relationship between
dietary intake of folate and risk of cardiovascular disease is

underscored by the recent mandate for fortification of grain and
cereal products with folate and recommendations to further increase
levels.15­17 Therefore, we took advantage of the large sample size
and prolonged follow-up experience of participants in the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) to examine
the relationship of dietary folate intake to subsequent risk of
cardiovascular disease in a nationally representative sample of the
US noninstitutionalized population.
Subjects and Methods
Study Population
The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I) used a multistage, stratified, probability sampling
design to select a representative sample of the US civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population aged 1 to 74 years.18,19 Certain population
subgroups, including those with a low income, women of childbear-
ing age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (65 years or older), were
oversampled. The NHEFS is a prospective cohort study of NHANES
I participants who were 25 to 74 years of age when the survey was

conducted between 1971 and 1975. Of the 14 407 persons in this age
range at baseline, we excluded 1353 who had a self-reported history
of heart attack, heart failure, or stroke at baseline or had used
medication for heart disease during the preceding 6 months, and we
excluded 2893 NHANES I Augmentation Survey participants for
whom the study protocol did not include collection of dietary
information. Among the remaining participants, 397 (3.9%) were
lost to follow-up, leaving a total of 9764 participants who contrib-
uted 161 236 person-years of experience.
Measurement
Baseline data collection included a medical history, dietary assessment,
standardized medical examination, laboratory tests, and anthropometric
measurements.18,19 The dietary assessment included a single 24-hour
dietary recall collected by trained NHANES I personnel using a standard-
ized protocol and 51 three-dimensional models to estimate portion size.
Dietary intake of folate was not available in the original NHANES I nutrient
database; therefore, a listing of the 3481 unique foods recorded during
collection of the 24 hour dietary recalls was obtained. Each unique food was
matched to a corresponding food item listed in the ESHA Food Processor
nutrient database by name and available nutrient content from NHANES I
documentation.20 Participants' dietary intake of folate (g/24 h), saturated
fat (g/24 h), and total energy (kcal/24 h) were calculated. A reliability
analysis was conducted to evaluate correspondence between NHANES I
and ESHA nutrient databases. Intraclass correlation coefficients for nutrient
intakes derived using NHANES I and ESHA food composition databases
ranged from 0.85 to 0.98, whereas graphical methods also demonstrated
good agreement for most nutrients (data not shown). Blood pressure, body
weight, and height were obtained using standard protocols.18 Frozen sera
were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for measure-
ment of serum total cholesterol levels. The baseline questionnaire on
medical history included questions about selected health conditions and
medications used for these conditions during the preceding 6 months. Data
on education, physical activity, and alcohol consumption were obtained by
means of interviewer-administered questionnaires. Information on smoking
status was obtained in 6913 participants who underwent a more detailed
baseline examination.18,19 For the remaining study participants, information
on smoking status at baseline was derived from responses to questions on
lifetime smoking history obtained at their follow-up interviews between
1982 to 1984 or later.21,22 The validity of information obtained using this
approach has been documented.23,24
Follow-Up Procedures
Follow-up data were collected between 1982 and 1984 and in 1986, 1987,
and 1992.21,22,25,26 Each follow-up examination included tracking a partic-
ipant or his/her proxy to a current address; performing an in-depth
interview; obtaining hospital and nursing home records, including pathol-
ogy reports and electrocardiograms; and, for decedents, acquiring a death
certificate. Incident stroke and cardiovascular disease events were based on
documentation of an event that met prespecified diagnostic criteria and
occurred during the period between the participant's baseline examination
and last follow-up interview. Validity of study outcome data has been
documented.27
Incident stroke was based on a death certificate report in which the
underlying cause of death was recorded with an International Classification
of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code of 430 to 438 or on one or more
hospital and/or nursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge
diagnosis with the above codes. Incident cardiovascular disease was based
on a death certificate report in which the underlying cause of death was
recorded using an ICD-9 code of 390 to 459 or on one or more hospital
and/or nursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge
diagnosis with the above codes. The date of record for incident events was
identified by the date of first hospital admission with an established study
event or date of death from a study event in the absence of hospital or
nursing home documentation.
Statistical Analysis
Dietary folate intake was modeled as a categorical (quartile groups) variable
in primary analyses and modeled continuously in additional analyses. In
continuous analyses, dietary folate intake was log transformed because of
right skew. The distribution of each baseline characteristic was calculated by
quartile of dietary folate intake (mean or percent of study participants). The
statistical significance of differences was examined by analysis of variance
(continuous variables) and by the 2 test (categorical variables). Trend tests
were conducted using orthogonal coefficients. The cumulative incidence of
cardiovascular disease by quartile of dietary folate intake was calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method,28 and differences in cumulative rates were
examined by the log-rank test for trend.29 The adjusted relationship between
dietary intake of folate and risk of cardiovascular disease was modeled using
Cox regression analysis.30 Cox proportional hazard models were stratified
by birth cohort using 10-year intervals to control for calendar period and
cohort effects.31 Age was used as the time-scale in all time-to-event
analyses.31 Methods to estimate variance that take into account sample
clustering and stratification of the NHANES I sample were used in the Cox
proportional hazards models.31 Because few participants remained and the
all-cause mortality was disproportionately high after age 85 years, all
analyses were truncated at this age.
Results
In this cohort, the median folate intake was 203.7 g per day with
an interquartile range of 164.6 g per day. Compared with those
with a lower intake, participants with a higher dietary folate intake
tended to be male and white (Table 1). Participants with a higher
intake of folate had, on average, a slightly lower systolic blood
pressure and serum total cholesterol than those with a lower dietary
folate intake. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia appeared less
often, on the whole, in participants with a higher folate intake
compared with those with a lower intake. In addition, participants
who consumed higher levels of folate tended to perform more
recreational physical activity than their counterparts who consumed
lower levels of folate in their diet. Participants in the lowest quartile
of folate intake had a higher body mass index than those in the
upper 3 quartiles. They were also less likely to have completed high
school, be consuming alcohol regularly, and be using a vitamin
supplement; however, cigarette smoking did not differ across
quartile of dietary folate intake. Energy and saturated fat intakes
tended to be higher with progressively higher intake of dietary
folate.
During the 161 236 person-years of follow-up between 1971 and
1992, 926 stroke events and 3758 cardiovascular disease events
were documented. Cumulative hazard of stroke by quartile of
dietary folate intake is presented in the Figure. The cumulative
hazard of stroke at age 85 years from the lowest to highest quartile
of dietary folate intake was 38.6%, 34.3%, 34.6%, and 32.9%
(P0.02 for trend). The cumulative hazard of cardiovascular
disease did not clearly separate by quartile of dietary folate intake in
Kaplan-Meier plots.
Relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(CI) for incidence of stroke and cardiovascular disease by quartile of
dietary folate intake are presented in Table 2. In age-, race-, sex-,
and energy-adjusted analyses, the risk of cardiovascular diseases
was significantly and inversely related to quartile of dietary folate
intake at baseline (P value for trend0.03), whereas the risk of
stroke was inversely related to quartile of dietary folate intake with
borderline significance (P value for trend0.09). After further
adjustment for history of diabetes, systolic blood pressure, serum
cholesterol, body mass index, recreational physical activity, level of
education, regular alcohol consumption, and current cigarette smok-
ing, dietary folate intake was significantly and inversely related to
the subsequent risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease. Partici-
pants who consumed at least 300 g of folate per day had a 20%
lower risk of stroke (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.99; P value for

trend0.03) and a 13% lower risk of cardiovascular disease (RR,
0.87; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.96; P value for trend0.002) than those
consuming less than 136 g of folate per day.
Results were consistent using the logarithm of dietary folate
intake as a continuous variable (Table 3). For instance, an increase
in the log of folate intake representing the interquartile range was
associated with a 9% lower risk of stroke (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83
to 0.99; P0.04) and an 8% lower risk of cardiovascular disease
(RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88 to 0.97; P0.001) after adjustment for
important cardiovascular disease risk factors.
The inverse associations between dietary intake of folate and
incidence of stroke and cardiovascular diseases seemed consistent
across genders, levels of physical activity, and tobacco use. For
example, the risk of stroke among women in the highest quartile of
folate intake was 17% (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.14) lower than
that of women in the lowest quartile, whereas the corresponding
estimate for men was 18% (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.11). For
smokers, the relative risk of stroke for the comparison of extreme
quartiles was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.46 to 1.16), similar to that of former
or nonsmokers (0.82; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.04). Estimates of relative
risk for the comparison of extreme quartiles were similar for
participants with low levels of recreational physical activity and
those with medium or high levels (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.18;
and RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.58 to 1.02; respectively). Measures of the
association between dietary folate intake and cardiovascular disease
were also comparable in groups based on gender, physical activity,
and tobacco use (data not shown).
Discussion
This prospective study documents the presence of an independent
and inverse relationship between dietary folate intake and risk of
stroke and cardiovascular diseases in adults. Stroke is the third
leading cause of death and the most common basis for long-term
disability in the US general population.32 Given the high mortality
and cost of treatment of stroke and other cardiovascular disease,
primary prevention should be a central goal of plans aimed at
reducing its societal burden. The findings from this study suggest
that a higher intake of folate may be associated with a lower risk of

have important public health implications.
Evidence relating homocysteine levels in blood and risk of
cardiovascular disease is abundant. A meta-analysis of 29 epidemi-
ological studies indicates that elevated levels of homocysteine are
related to stroke and cardiovascular disease.33,34 In addition, dietary
folate intake has been inversely related to plasma levels of total
homocysteine in several epidemiological studies.6­10,33 At least 1
prospective study has suggested the presence of an inverse associ-
ation between risk of stroke and serum concentrations of folate in a
separate random subsample of 2006 participants in the NHEFS who
underwent a detailed physical examination.11 The latter study
suffered from a small sample size and few events (98 strokes),
which may have contributed to the lack of statistical significance in
most findings. This study extends those results by examining the
association between dietary folate and the risk of stroke and
cardiovascular disease in a much larger sample.
Few data are currently available regarding the effect of dietary
folate on risk of cardiovascular disease. In 1998, Rimm et al14
identified a significant inverse relationship between dietary intake of
folate from foods and supplements and subsequent risk of coronary
heart disease in a cohort of US nurses. That study did not report an
association between dietary folate and risk of stroke or the com-
bined outcome of cardiovascular disease and was conducted in a
select, highly educated, female population that may have different
dietary characteristics than the US general population. Mean folate
intake in that study was 366 g/day, well above the national
average of 224 g/day.14 Our study is conducted in a representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized US population, therefore our
findings are highly generalizable.
Folate supplementation reduces blood levels of homocysteine,
which many believe to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular
disease. The mechanism by which homocysteine may increase risk
of stroke and cardiovascular diseases remains unclear.35 Homocys-
teine may promote atherogenesis by damaging the vascular matrix,
increasing proliferation of endothelial cells, and facilitating oxida-
tive injury of vascular walls.36,37 In addition, homocysteine may
increase coagulation and disturb endothelium-dependent vasomotor
regulation.36 To date, most experimental studies have involved
extreme concentrations of homocysteine not present in the general
population; therefore, the results of these studies may have limited
relevance.37 In addition to regulation of homocysteine, folate itself
may have vasculoprotective effects.38 A recent randomized trial
demonstrated that supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B6

subclinical atherosclerosis.39
It is possible that persons who consume high levels of folate in
their diet may have other dietary and nondietary lifestyle factors that
promote health, such as exercising regularly, not smoking, using
aspirin regularly, and consuming a diet low in saturated fat. To
reduce the impact of such "healthy habits," the estimates of risk in
our study were adjusted for important potential confounders of
cardiovascular disease like age, race, sex, education level, recre-
ational physical activity, cigarette smoking, diabetic status, regular
alcohol consumption, and total energy intake. When vitamin sup-
plement use, often considered an indicator of a "healthy lifestyle,"
was added to multivariate models, risk estimates did not change. In
multivariate models adjusted for established cardiovascular disease
risk factors and vitamin supplement use, the relative risks of stroke
and cardiovascular disease for the comparison of extreme quartiles
were 0.80 (95% CI from 0.64 to 0.99; P for linear trend0.04) and
0.87 (95% CI from 0.79 to 0.97; P for linear trend0.003),
respectively. When any aspirin use in the past 30 days was added to
models in addition to established cardiovascular risk factors, the
relative risks of stroke and cardiovascular disease in extreme
quartiles were 0.82 (95% CI from 0.65 to 1.02; P for linear
trend0.05) and 0.88 (95% CI from 0.79 to 0.97; P for linear
trend0.004), respectively. Moreover, it is reassuring that when the
study population was examined by subgroups based on gender,
tobacco use, and physical activity, the inverse association between
dietary intake of folate and risk of stroke was consistent in both
direction and magnitude.
The present study has several limitations. One limitation of this
study is the estimation of dietary folate intake using a single 24-hour
dietary recall. Because of day-to-day variability in participants' food
intakes, estimates from a single day of intake may not be represen-
tative of participants' usual, long-term intake and so may result in
misclassification of usual folate consumption at the individual
level.40­42 However, such random errors of measurement in folate
intake would tend to bias any observed association toward the null
rather than create a spurious association. Second, information on
folic acid supplementation from multivitamin use was not collected
in the NHANES I study. Therefore, folic acid supplements could
not be taken into account in the analysis. Although approximately
30% of our sample reported the regular or irregular use of any type
of vitamin supplement during their baseline examination (1971 to
1975), only 12.6% of persons reported regularly using multivita-
mins that may have contained folate, and they were equally
distributed across levels of dietary folate intake. During the early
1970s when this data were collected, the folate content of vitamin
supplements was restricted to 100 g in a single day's preparation
available without prescription.43 Thus vitamin supplements may not
have been a significant source of folate in this sample and so may
not confound the relationship we observed. Third, folate intake was
calculated using a current nutrient database that might overestimate
folate intake over the whole study population because of changes in
the folate content of foods. This may not affect the rank of dietary
folate intake for each individual in the study population and thus not
bias our finding of an inverse association between dietary folate
intake and risk of stroke. In addition, some NHANES I participants
may have underreported their dietary energy intake.44,45 However,
adjustment for energy intake in our analyses may have reduced the
potential impact of such underreporting.
This study maintained several strengths. Foremost, this study was
conducted in a nationally representative sample of the noninstitu-
tionalized US population; therefore these findings are broadly
generalizable. In addition, temporal relationships can be established
with confidence because intake of folate was estimated from dietary
information collected at baseline. Further, assessment of the inci-
dence of cardiovascular diseases occurred over an average of 19
years of follow-up, and more than 96% of the study participants
were successfully tracked through 1992.
In conclusion, these findings indicate that dietary intake of folate
from food sources is independently and inversely related to the risk
of stroke and cardiovascular disease in a representative sample of
the noninstitutionalized US population. Folate intake has been
inversely related to homocysteine levels, an important risk factor for
stroke and cardiovascular disease. Food fortification of folic acid
was mandated in 1996 to be fully implemented by 1998.15 A
fortification of 140 g of synthetic folic acid per 100 g of enriched
grain product was used to provide an additional 80 to 100 g of
folic acid per day to the diet of women of childbearing age and 70
to 120 g to the diet of middle-aged and older adults. Assuming a
causal and linear association between dietary folate intake and
stroke risk, an increase of 95 g/day in the diet of middle-aged and
older adults would be consistent with an approximate 12% reduc-
tion in stroke risk over 20 years based on our data. Given these
results, increasing intake of folate from foods may be an important
element in dietary interventions to reduce the incidence of stroke
and cardiovascular diseases. As in all observational epidemiological
studies, imperfect measurement of confounding variables and un-
measured potential confounders may bias study findings. Further
studies designed to examine the relationship of dietary folate intake
and risk of stroke and cardiovascular diseases are needed to shed
light on this important public health issue.

Editorial Comment
Folate and the Risk of Stroke: Fortify First and Ask Questions Later?
In this article, Bazzano and colleagues demonstrated an inverse
relationship between dietary intake of folate and the risk of stroke
and cardiovascular disease. This association has been reported
previously in several epidemiologic studies,1­4 but the present study
is the first to confirm its existence in a large prospective cohort of a
representative sample of the US population. People whose daily diet
included at least 300 g of folate (about three fourths of the current
US Recommended Daily Allowance of 400 g) were about 20%
less likely to suffer a subsequent stroke than those whose daily diet
contained less than 136 g. This relationship persisted even after
adjusting for other dietary and vascular risk factors. It is often
extraordinarily difficult to explore the connection between nutrition
and disease, both retrospectively and prospectively, because of
numerous potential threats to validity such as inaccuracies of dietary

recall, variability in eating habits, and confounding by other dietary
and environmental exposures.5 The current study is certainly no
exception, but the authors address the limitations effectively in their
discussion. Thus, along with the prior reports, Bazzano and col-
leagues have provided us with credible class II evidence that greater
folate consumption is associated with a lower risk of subsequent
stroke, and support for a level B recommendation that folate is
probably effective in stroke prevention.
As with all observational studies, the question of causality
lingers.6 The relationship is biologically plausible, as folate reduces
serum levels of homocysteine.7 However, the mechanisms by
which homocysteine increases the risk of vascular disease remain
uncertain and continue to be extensively studied in vascular biology.
An alternative approach to establishing causality, which would
also provide upgraded class I evidence, may come in the form of
definitive randomized controlled clinical trials. To determine if
folate supplementation is effective in primary or secondary preven-
tion of vascular events, 3 major trials are currently under way in
North America: the Vitamin Intervention for Stroke Prevention
(VISP) trial, the Women's Antioxidant Cardiovascular Disease
Study (WACS), and the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-
The Ongoing Outcomes (HOPE-TOO) study. In each of these trials,
patients are randomly assigned to receive either high-dose folate
(2.5 to 5 mg daily) along with vitamins B6
(pyridoxine) and B12
(cobalamin) versus very low­dose folate (20 g daily in VISP) or
placebo (in WACS and HOPE-TOO). There is a potential conun-
drum facing these trials that may undermine their ability to answer
this important clinical question. Because of the evidence for reduc-
tion of neural tube defects with folate, the US Food and Drug
Administration mandated the addition of 140 g of folic acid per
100 g of flour, rice, pasta, cornmeal, and related food products by
January 1998.8 The 3 major vascular studies started enrolling
patients after this date but had been designed before this date and
estimated the expected treatment effect and respective sample sizes
based on prior data that did not reflect massive vitamin fortification
policies. In effect, the control arms of these studies are now exposed
to much higher levels of folate than was intended. Consequently,
there is a high probability that all 3 studies will be underpowered to
detect differences among groups.9 Moreover, negative results from
these otherwise well-designed randomized clinical trials may be
believed to provide class I evidence that folate supplementation
does not reduce the risk of vascular disease, even if the data are
falsely negative due to these sample size considerations (ie, type II
error).
How, then, are we to proceed in the face of this impending
possible paradox, and what should we recommend? The random-
ized trials should go on to completion, and there is no ethical issue
about withholding a "proven" therapy since even the control
patients are receiving some level of folate supplementation from
their diets. Even if individually negative, the combined weight (ie,
future meta-analysis) of these trials may have enough power to
detect a treatment effect if one does in fact exist. Further, these trials
may identify relevant subgroups for whom higher doses of folate
may be particularly important. Finally, these trials may determine
whether there are any safety concerns with high doses of folate that
have not been apparent to date. Until then, outside the context of
clinical trials, we should recommend (level B rating) dietary intake
of at least 300 to 400 g of folate for patients at risk for
cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. A list of breakfast
cereals that contain 100% of the recommended amount of folate can
be found at http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/folicacid/cereal.htm.
