Abstract
Recently, genetic association findings for nicotine dependence, smoking behavior, and smoking-related diseases converged
to implicate the chromosome 15q25.1 region, which includes the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 cholinergic nicotinic receptor
subunit genes. In particular, association with the nonsynonymous CHRNA5 SNP rs16969968 and correlates has been
replicated in several independent studies. Extensive genotyping of this region has suggested additional statistically distinct
signals for nicotine dependence, tagged by rs578776 and rs588765. One goal of the Consortium for the Genetic Analysis of
Smoking Phenotypes (CGASP) is to elucidate the associations among these markers and dichotomous smoking quantity
(heavy versus light smoking), lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We performed a meta-
analysis across 34 datasets of European-ancestry subjects, including 38,617 smokers who were assessed for cigarettes-per-
day, 7,700 lung cancer cases and 5,914 lung-cancer-free controls (all smokers), and 2,614 COPD cases and 3,568 COPD-free
controls (all smokers). We demonstrate statistically independent associations of rs16969968 and rs588765 with smoking
(mutually adjusted p-values,10235 and ,1028 respectively). Because the risk alleles at these loci are negatively correlated,
their association with smoking is stronger in the joint model than when each SNP is analyzed alone. Rs578776 also
demonstrates association with smoking after adjustment for rs16969968 (p,1026). In models adjusting for cigarettes-per-
day, we confirm the association between rs16969968 and lung cancer (p,10220) and observe a nominally significant
association with COPD (p = 0.01); the other loci are not significantly associated with either lung cancer or COPD after
adjusting for rs16969968. This study provides strong evidence that multiple statistically distinct loci in this region affect
smoking behavior. This study is also the first report of association between rs588765 (and correlates) and smoking that
achieves genome-wide significance; these SNPs have previously been associated with mRNA levels of CHRNA5 in brain and
lung tissue.

Independent Chromosome 15q25.1 Loci Affect Smoking
PLoS Genetics | www.plosgenetics.org 2 August 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 8 | e1001053
Introduction
Smoking is associated with many different diseases. Lung
cancer is the illness most identified with smoking, and its
prevalence over time mirrors per capita tobacco consumption [1].
There has been a reduction in smoking in the United States, and
a concomitant decline in the incidence of lung cancer is
beginning to emerge. Nonetheless more people die from lung
cancer each year than from any other cancer [2]. Chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), another serious lung
disease largely attributable to smoking, is also among the leading
causes of death.
Recently, genetic findings for nicotine dependence and
smoking related diseases converged to implicate the chromosome
15q25.1 region, which includes the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4
cluster of cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit genes. The
nicotine dependence locus tagged by the single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) rs16969968 and correlates has been
replicated for smoking related traits including cigarettes-per-day
and heavy smoking [3­11], and has been reported as the most
significant association genome-wide in very recent meta-analyses
[12­14]. This locus has also been associated with risk for lung
cancer and COPD in several genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) [6,15­18]. This represents an exciting overlap of
genetic findings for nicotine dependence and smoking
related diseases. Though different SNPs may be reported by
each study, the high correlation between the associated SNPs
(r2.0.8 with rs16969968) implies that these statistical signals tag
the same locus in European-ancestry populations. The SNP
rs16969968 results in an amino acid change (D398N) in the
alpha5 receptor subunit protein and has been shown to affect
receptor function [19].
Extensive genotyping of the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4
region has provided potential evidence for at least two additional
distinct signals for nicotine dependence [4,7,8,20]. A second locus,
tagged by rs578776, is associated with nicotine dependence and
smoking in several samples of European-ancestry, with the minor
allele protective in the sense that it is elevated in controls; rs578776
has only low correlation with rs16969968 in European-ancestry
populations (r2 = 0.24 in the HapMap CEU panel), though the
linkage disequilibrium (LD) coefficient |D'| is 1. A third
important locus in this region is a group of highly correlated
SNPs, tagged by rs588765, which are associated with mRNA
levels of CHRNA5 in brain tissue [21,22] and lung tissue [23­25]
from European-ancestry subjects. When rs16969968 and rs588765
(or correlates) are studied together, three common haplotypes are
observed, each with distinct effects on risk [7,22]. There are hints
that other, less common variants (minor allele frequency
(MAF)#5%) also contribute to nicotine dependence in this region,
including a fourth locus represented by rs12914008 which has
shown a relatively strong odds ratio of 0.73 in European-American
subjects [4].
With the support of the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA), we formed the Consortium for the Genetic Analysis of
Smoking Phenotypes (CGASP), which includes smoking, lung
cancer, and COPD researchers, to enable the pursuit of several
research goals. For this first analysis project we focused on the
chromosome 15q25.1 region containing CHRNA5-CHRNA3-
CHRNB4. Specifically, we focused on the four distinct loci
discussed above, which have low correlation with each other
and have demonstrated evidence for involvement in nicotine
dependence. Analyses were undertaken to investigate two
questions: first, are there multiple statistically distinct genetic loci
in this region that exert independent effects on smoking, and
second, are similar patterns of genetic risk shared across smoking,
lung cancer, and COPD.
Methods
Ethics statement
This study was conducted according to the principles expressed
in the Declaration of Helsinki and obtained informed consent from
participants and approval from the appropriate institutional
review boards.
Samples and study design
All subjects included in these meta-analyses were current or
former smokers of European ancestry. Results from 34 datasets,
which include a total of 38,617 unrelated subjects who were
assessed for cigarettes-per-day, contributed to the meta-analyses.
Eight of the datasets were drawn from family-based studies and
contributed only a subset of unrelated individuals to these analyses.
Table 1 gives sample sizes and demographics of each participating
study sample. Text S1 describes additional details for each dataset,
including ascertainment criteria and genotyping methods, and
documents that four datasets are also members of other consortia.
All datasets contributed to the analyses of smoking. A subset of
these 34 datasets also had information on lung cancer cases and
lung-cancer-free smoker controls (6 datasets, N = 13,614 smokers)
and/or COPD cases and COPD-free smoker controls (4 datasets,
N = 6,182 smokers). The data for these traits are described in
Table 2 and Table 3 respectively.
Traits for analysis
The traits examined were smoking quantity, lung cancer, and
COPD. Two smoking traits were derived from measurements of
cigarettes smoked per day (CPD): a 4-level categorical trait
(CPD#10, 10,CPD#20, 20,CPD#30, and CPD.30) and a
dichotomous trait contrasting subjects from the lowest smoking
category (CPD#10: light-smoking ``controls'') to those in the two
highest categories combined (CPD.20: heavy smoking cases). The
dichotomous trait of heavy versus light smoking was our primary
trait for analysis. For one study (NAG-Finland), which used
different boundaries to record CPD as detailed in the supplemen-
tal material, the distribution of CPD was examined to harmonize
Author Summary
Nicotine binds to cholinergic nicotinic receptors, which are
composed of a variety of subunits. Genetic studies for
smoking behavior and smoking-related diseases have
implicated a genomic region that encodes the alpha5,
alpha3, and beta4 subunits. We examined genetic data
across this region for over 38,000 smokers, a subset of
which had been assessed for lung cancer or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease. We demonstrate strong
evidence that there are at least two statistically indepen-
dent loci in this region that affect risk for heavy smoking.
One of these loci represents a change in the protein
structure of the alpha5 subunit. This work is also the first to
report strong evidence of association between smoking
and a group of genetic variants that are of biological
interest because of their links to expression of the alpha5
cholinergic nicotinic receptor subunit gene. These advanc-
es in understanding the genetic influences on smoking
behavior are important because of the profound public
health burdens caused by smoking and nicotine addiction.

the phenotypes and select alternative boundaries. The numbers of
subjects in each smoking category, total and by study, are given in
Table 1. Lung cancer and COPD were analyzed as dichotomous
traits. COPD cases were defined to have COPD as determined by
post-bronchodilator spirometry as GOLD Stage II or worse
(N = 1,719), or self-reported COPD, emphysema or chronic
bronchitis.
SNPs for analysis
In European-ancestry populations, each of the four loci of
interest can be represented by various highly correlated SNPs
(SNPs having high r2 with each other). For each locus, we chose
one target SNP for analysis: rs16969968 (locus 1), rs578776 (locus
2), rs588765 (locus 3), and rs12914008 (locus 4); the pairwise
correlations between any two of these loci are r2,0.5 (Table S1).
In samples for which a given target SNP was not available, we
chose a highly correlated proxy SNP based on r2 computed with
Haploview [26] using downloaded HapMap CEU genotype data,
Release 23 [27]. Table S2 lists the proxy SNPs used and their r2
with the corresponding target SNPs. Figure S1 displays the SNPs
for each of the 4 loci in relation to the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-
CHRNB4 cluster.

Statistical analyses and meta-analysis
To ensure uniform analyses, SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
R [28] scripts for genetic association analyses were developed
centrally and then distributed. The scripts were executed by each
participating site, and the results returned to the coordinating
group.
In each dataset, associations between the loci and the traits were
evaluated using logistic regression. Our primary analysis model
coded genotypes additively as the number of copies of the minor
allele according to the HapMap CEU reference population. This
allele is referred to as the ``coded allele'' (C) and the major allele is
referred to as the ``reference allele'' (R). To confirm the
appropriateness of the additive model, for each locus a 2 degree
of freedom model including the additive term and a heterozygote
deviation term was evaluated. The analyses of the 4-level CPD
trait used generalized logistic regression to obtain separate effect
estimates (beta coefficients) for each category with respect to the
lowest smoking category as the referent. All these association
analyses included sex and age as covariates. In addition, lung
cancer and COPD analyses included categorical cigarettes-per-day
as an unordered covariate.
Association results from each dataset, including the beta
coefficient and standard error, were provided to the coordinating
team. Meta-analysis was carried out using PLINK [29] to obtain
overall summary odds ratios (ORs) and statistics. The R package
rmeta [30] was used to verify results and create plots. There was
no evidence of significant heterogeneity across datasets for these
analyses (minimum heterogeneity p = 0.21 for dichotomous CPD,
0.07 for lung cancer, 0.24 for COPD; for categorical CPD a
nominally significant p was seen only for category 3 and locus 1
(p = 0.007)). Because of varying study designs, ascertainment
strategies, and representative SNPs, we nevertheless report results
from random effects meta-analyses.
As noted earlier, locus 1 (representing rs16969968) is a highly
replicated association finding and furthermore rs16969968 has
been shown to have functional effects on the resulting alpha5-
containing receptor [19]. Therefore an important question is
whether the remaining loci demonstrate additional independent
effects on disease risk. Although loci 2, 3 and 4 are not highly
correlated with rs16969968, |D'| is high. A high |D'| can
correspond to a low r2 if the alleles that tend to co-occur on the
same haplotype have very different allele frequencies. Previous
results in the COGEND data suggest that there may be
independent or synergistic effects on nicotine dependence between
locus 1 and locus 3 [4], and haplotype analyses in the Utah and
LHS samples [7], and in the COGEND and CPS-II-CPD samples
[22], also indicate effects of haplotypes containing loci 1, 2 and 3.
To test whether additional loci contribute to dichotomous
smoking quantity over and above the effect of rs16969968, we
included both locus 1 and each of the other loci in the logistic
regression models adjusting for sex and age, with and without a
SNP6SNP interaction term. For lung cancer and COPD the
models also included categorical cigarettes-per-day as an unor-
dered covariate. These results were then meta-analyzed as
described above. The SNP6SNP interaction term was never
significant in the meta-analysis (p.0.3), so we report results from
the joint models without interactions. To allow comparison
between single-SNP and joint results on comparable data, for

each locus pair we also repeated the univariate single-SNP meta-
analyses on the subset of datasets that had genotypes available at
both loci. For dichotomous smoking quantity we also tabulated
pair-wise joint genotype by case status counts for locus 1
(rs16969968) versus each of the other three loci across the
contributing datasets that had both loci.
Multiple test correction
Across the four target loci, multiple traits (4), the multiple
models (additive and additive+heterozygote deviation), and the 2-
SNP joint analyses (3 loci), our study was designed to perform
fewer than 80 tests. A conservative Bonferroni correction would
result in an uncorrected p-value threshold of 6.2561024
corresponding to an experiment-wide alpha of 0.05. The results
tables report uncorrected p-values which we compared to this
threshold to determine statistical significance.
Results
We calculated allele frequencies within each sample to confirm
that the coded allele (minor allele in HapMap CEU) was indeed
the minor allele as expected in these European-ancestry subjects.
Table S3 shows allele frequencies in each sample for the SNPs
used. For each locus, frequencies are similar across studies and
proxy SNPs, and similar to the frequencies in the HapMap CEU
reference population.
All reported results are based on additive models. The additive
model is appropriate because none of the tests for deviation from
the additive assumption were significant. For each analysis, the
tables and figures report the number of individuals successfully
genotyped for the relevant SNP or SNPs.
Dichotomous CPD, single-SNP analysis
Table 4 summarizes the meta-analysis results of dichotomous
CPD (heavy/light smoking) in single-SNP analysis. Meta-analysis
across all 34 samples clearly shows a highly significant association
between dichotomous CPD and locus 1 (tagging rs16969968).
Figure 1 displays a forest plot of the summary meta-analysis
results for locus 1 (p = 5.96610231, OR = 1.33, 95% confidence
interval (1.26­1.39)), and also the ORs in each contributing
dataset.
The same analysis of locus 2 (tagging rs578776) yields a meta-
analysis p-value of 1.38610225 and an OR of 0.78 (0.74­0.81),
indicating a protective association for the minor allele as has
previously been reported (Figure 2). Locus 3 (tagging rs588765)
under the same model gives a p-value of 0.00027 and OR of 0.93
(0.89­0.97), which meets our threshold for multiple-test corrected
significance but, unlike locus 1 and locus 2, does not surpass
genome-wide significance (Figure 3). Locus 4 (tagging rs12914008)
does not show a main effect on dichotomous CPD (p = 0.45,
OR = 1.05 (0.93­1.17). The forest plot for locus 4 is given in
Figure S2.
Categorical CPD, single-SNP analysis
The categorical CPD analysis, which includes all 4 CPD levels
in a generalized logit model, allows us to evaluate genetic effects
for each CPD category with respect to the lowest smoking class
(CPD#10). Table 5 shows the results.
For locus 1 (rs16969968), we see an ordinal effect with increasing
CPD; that is, the odds ratio increases from 1.15 to 1.29 to 1.40 for
categories 2, 3 and 4, with a corresponding decrease in p-value from
3.1761028 to 2.12610212 to 5.47610240. A similar ordinal effect is
seen for locus 2 (rs578776), with the odds ratio decreasing from 0.88
to 0.79 to 0.77. For locus 3 (rs588765) we see an effect only with the
highest smoking category (CPD.30). For locus 4 no effect is seen
across smoking categories, consistent with the dichotomous CPD
results.
Joint analysis for dichotomous CPD
To dissect the potential distinct effects of these loci on heavy
versus light smoking, we carried out meta-analyses of joint SNP
models that included sex, age, locus 1 and each of the other loci,
coded additively.
In the joint analysis of locus 1 and locus 2, there is suggestive
evidence of distinct effects, but the association at locus 2 is no
longer genome-wide significant in the presence of locus 1. Both
SNPs become less significant compared to their single locus
models: in the joint model, locus 1 gives p = 2.15610222,
OR = 1.27 (1.21­1.33) and locus 2 gives p = 4.5061027,
OR = 0.87 (0.83­0.92). When each SNP is placed individually
in the model and meta-analyzed across the 32 datasets that
provided data for both loci, locus 1 gives p = 1.41610232,
OR = 1.34 while locus 2 gives p = 1.38610225, OR = 0.76. The
risk-increasing alleles at locus 1 (C) and locus 2 (R) are positively
correlated, even though the minor alleles are negatively
correlated.
In joint analysis of locus 1 and locus 3, locus 1 (rs16969968)
yields a p-value of 3.52610236, OR = 1.47 (1.38­1.56); locus 3
(rs588765) gives p = 6.0361029, OR = 1.17 (1.11­1.23). Thus
locus 3 attains genome-wide significance (p,561028) after
adjusting for the effect of locus 1. Note that adjusting for locus 1
changes the direction of effect for locus 3 (OR.1) compared to the
single-SNP results. In the 33 datasets that have both loci
genotyped, we obtain p = 5.39610229, OR = 1.32 for locus 1

alone, and p = 0.00027, OR = 0.93 (0.89­0.97) for locus 3 alone.
The evidence for association in the joint model is stronger than
when each SNP is analyzed alone. In fact, when locus 1 is not
taken into account, the effect of locus 3 is potentially masked, and
the effect of the minor allele is in an opposite direction (protective
versus risk).
To further examine these interesting results for locus 1 and locus
3, we show the number of heavy and light smokers in each joint
genotype class, and corresponding odds ratios using the genotype
that is homozygous for both reference (major) alleles as the
reference group (Table 6). The reference alleles (major in HapMap
CEU) are labeled ``R'' and the coded alleles (minor in HapMap
CEU) are labeled ``C''.
The first important observation is that there are very few
subjects in certain cells, namely the cells corresponding to RC/CC
at locus 1/locus 3, CC/RC, and CC at both loci. This table
therefore reveals that the risk alleles at locus 1 (C) and locus 3 (C)
are negatively correlated, and explains why the effect of rs588765
is seen only after adjusting for rs16969968. This pattern also
reflects the high |D'| between the loci.
The second observation is that for the remaining, well
populated cells, the coded allele at locus 3 increases risk on the

coding in the logistic regression with age and sex as covariates. The box size indicates the precision of the OR estimate. The case and control totals
include only individuals with a genotype call for locus 1. The heterogeneity p-value is 0.21.

background of a fixed genotype at locus 1 (e.g. row 1 of the table,
corresponding to the stratum of RR homozygotes at locus 1).
Similarly, for a fixed genotype at locus 3, the coded allele at locus 1
increases risk (e.g. column 1 of the table, corresponding to the
stratum of RR homozygotes at locus 3). Thus for each locus, the
effect seen in the joint, 2-SNP logistic regression is confirmed in
the most informative stratum at the other locus.
For locus 1 and locus 4 in the joint model, locus 1 gives
p = 1.01610238, OR = 1.35 (1.29­1.41) and locus 4 gives
p = 5.5561023, OR = 1.17 (1.05­1.31). While the effect for locus
4 is stronger than was seen in single-SNP analysis, it does not meet
our multiple test threshold for significance. In single-SNP analysis
of the 25 datasets that have genotypes at both loci, locus 1 alone
gives p = 7.56610235, OR = 1.33; locus 4 is non-significant
(p = 0.45, OR = 1.05).
Lung cancer controlled for CPD
In Table 7 we report the single-SNP meta-analysis results for
the six lung cancer datasets; recall that all subjects were smokers,
and sex, age and categorical CPD were included as covariates. As
with the CPD traits, locus 1 (rs16969968) shows highly significant
evidence for association with lung cancer (p = 1.99610221). The
summary odds ratio of 1.31 (1.24­1.38) closely matches the
dichotomous CPD odds ratio of 1.33 (1.26­1.39). Figure 4 shows
the association results for locus 1 by dataset and the overall meta-
analysis results.
Locus 2 (rs578776) also shows evidence of association with lung
cancer in single-SNP analysis (p = 9.74610210; OR = 0.82 (0.77­
0.87)) (Figure 5). Locus 3 results in a p-value of 0.0004 (OR = 0.90
(0.86­0.96)) (Figure 6); as with categorical CPD, this meets our
multiple-test-corrected threshold but is not genome-wide signifi-

cant. Locus 4 shows no evidence for association with lung cancer;
the forest plot is given in Figure S3.
Joint analyses for lung cancer controlled for CPD
Similar to our analyses of categorical CPD, we carried out joint
analyses of locus 1 with each of the other 3 loci, with covariates for
sex, age and dummy-coded CPD. After adjusting for the effect of
locus 1, none of the other loci reached our multiple-test-corrected
significance threshold.
For locus 1 and locus 2 jointly in the model, locus 1 gave
p = 2.68610213, OR = 1.26 (1.19­1.34) and locus 2 gave
p = 0.012, OR = 0.91 (0.85­0.98). In joint analysis of locus 1 and
locus 3, locus 1 yields p = 2.24610219, OR = 1.39 (1.30­1.50) and
locus 3 gives p = 0.0050, OR = 1.11 (1.03­1.19), showing the same
change from protective to risk for the minor allele as was observed
in the dichotomous CPD analysis. Finally, in the last pairing, locus
1 gives p = 2.66610222 OR = 1.33 (1.26­1.41) and locus 4 gives
p = 0.028, OR = 1.26 (1.02­1.55).
COPD controlled for CPD
Table 8 summarizes the meta-analysis results for the 3 datasets
with the COPD trait; as with lung cancer, all subjects were
smokers and sex, age, and categorical CPD were included as
covariates. In these analyses, only locus 1 provides even suggestive
evidence for association though it does not survive multiple test
correction (uncorrected p = 0.01). The locus 1 odds ratio is 1.12

lung cancer (1.31) (Figure 7).
Discussion
The first goal of this meta-analysis project was to test whether
distinct loci in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster
demonstrate independent effects on smoking behavior (heavy
(CPD.20) versus light (CPD#10) smoking). We selected loci for
study based on prior statistical and/or functional evidence for
involvement. The second goal was to test whether similar patterns
of association are seen across these loci in the smoking-related
diseases of lung cancer and COPD. This meta-analysis marks the
first large-scale effort to line up association results for these related
traits ­ smoking, lung cancer, and COPD ­ using a uniform
analysis protocol. Our results contribute important new insights
about genetic risk for these traits. In particular, we demonstrate
strong evidence that smoking behavior is influenced by multiple
distinct loci in this region, including two loci that are associated
with relevant biological effects in functional studies.
First, our results show that locus 1, representing the CHRNA5
amino acid change rs16969968 and correlates, demonstrates
highly significant association with smoking behavior (OR = 1.33,
p = 5.96610231). Our strong evidence for the involvement of locus

1 with smoking across these samples marks the robustness of its
genetic effect. The contributing datasets for the smoking analyses
range from samples ascertained for nicotine dependence, lung
cancer, or COPD, to adolescent samples, to populations
ascertained for a variety of diseases including schizophrenia,
alcohol or other substance dependence, breast cancer, type 2
diabetes, and heart disease. This meta-analysis represents a very
diverse group, and yet the association between rs16969968 and
smoking behavior is consistent.
The second, and novel, finding from this meta-analysis is the
evidence for an additional, distinct, locus in this region that is
associated with heavy/light smoking and is genome-wide signif-
icant. We demonstrated that locus 3, representing rs588765 and
correlates, attains a p-value of p = 6.0361029 (OR = 1.17) when
we adjust for locus 1 in a logistic regression model. It is notable
that the association between locus 3 and CPD is not as apparent in
the single-SNP analysis that does not control for locus 1 (e.g. meta-
analysis p = 0.0003, OR = 0.93, which does not reach genome-
wide significance). The negative correlation between the risk alleles
at locus 1 and locus 3 (r = 20.64) masks the effect at the latter
locus in single-SNP analysis, a phenomenon known as suppression
[31,32]. The association evidence for both SNPs is strengthened in
the joint analysis, with a reversal of the direction of effect for locus
3. This evidence of statistically independent association for locus 3
with smoking in our analysis is compelling given that these SNPs
have also been implicated in altered mRNA levels for CHRNA5 in
brain and lung tissue from European-ancestry subjects [21,22,24].
Thus, both statistical and functional evidence indicate that at least
one SNP correlated with CHRNA5 mRNA levels is involved in
risk, and highlight locus 3 as an important group of SNPs for
further investigation.
A third observation from this study is that locus 2 (rs578776 and
correlates) shows evidence for involvement in heavy/light
smoking. Locus 2 is genome-wide significant in the single-SNP
analysis of dichotomous CPD without adjustment for locus 1, with
the minor allele elevated in controls (meta-analysis
p = 1.38610225, OR = 0.78). However the association is much
weaker (p = 4.5061027, OR = 0.87) in the joint logistic regression
model that includes locus 1 and locus 2. One interpretation is that
part of the single-SNP association at locus 2 is driven by the effect
of locus 1 (perhaps related to the high |D'|). Nevertheless, there is
evidence for residual signal at locus 2.
We tested a fourth locus representing rs12914008, a relatively
uncommon (MAF ,5%) non-synonymous SNP in CHRNB4 that
has previously shown suggestive evidence for association in
European-Americans [4]. In both the univariate analysis and the
joint analysis with locus 1, locus 4 is not associated with smoking
behavior after multiple test correction. Because of the low allele
frequency of this variant, the power to detect an effect is lower
than for the other three loci.
This meta-analysis therefore highlights locus 1, locus 2, and
locus 3, and indicates dependencies in their effects on risk for
heavy smoking. Haplotypes based on these three loci have been
described [7,22] and are seen in HapMap CEU, where the
observed haplotype patterns for rs16969968 (locus 1), rs578776
(locus 2), and rs588765 (locus 3) are: A-G-C (frequency 0.425), G-

G-T (0.333), G-A-C (0.207), G-A-T (0.035). Only four of the eight
possible haplotypes are observed. This is consistent with the
correlation structure between the loci. Locus 2 and locus 3 have
low correlation with each other (e.g. r2 = 0.07 between rs578776
and rs588765 in HapMap CEU release 23); however their
correlation sharply increases when locus 1 is taken into account
(e.g. in GG homozygotes at rs16969968, r2 = 0.74 in HapMap
CEU).
Our association results together with the correlation patterns of
these three loci suggest that future haplotype or diplotype analyses
across large datasets could clarify the relative contributions of these
loci. Our evidence that multiple distinct genetic loci affect smoking
quantity is consistent with previous reports of risk and protective
haplotypes for nicotine dependence in the Utah and LHS samples
[7], and in the COGEND and CPS-II-CPD samples [22]. The
Utah/LHS study haplotype included 5 SNPs: two that represent
locus 1 (rs16969968 and rs1051730), two that represent locus 2
(rs569207 and rs578776), and one that represents locus 3
(rs680244). The COGEND and CPS-II-CPD haplotype analyses
included up to 3 loci, one each for locus 1, 2 and 3. Across all these
published studies, the high-risk haplotype carries the risk allele at
rs16969968 (locus 1); because of the high |D'| between loci, only
one haplotype carries that allele. Among the remaining haplo-
types, a low risk haplotype is obtained when the minor allele at
locus 2 or the major allele at locus 3, or both, is paired with the
non-risk allele at rs16969968.
Taken together, our meta-analysis results argue strongly for the
existence of at least two statistically distinct loci in this region that
affect risk for heavy smoking. In particular, both locus 1 and locus
3, which have known functional effects, are genome-wide
significant in joint, mutually-adjusted analysis. The minor allele
at locus 3 shifts from a marginally significant protective factor
when considered alone to a robust risk factor when considered in
combination with locus 1. The statistical evidence and negatively
correlated alleles at locus 1 and locus 3 are consistent with at least
two mechanistic models: distinct effects of two loci where the
minor allele at each locus increases risk across a constant
background at the other locus, or a haplotype dose effect where
alleles at the two loci act in concert on the same haplotype strand.
In the latter model, the minor-major and major-minor haplotypes
each increase risk relative to the major-major haplotype, as can be
seen in Table 6 once it is recognized that the rarity of the minor-
minor haplotype implies that the double-heterozygote cell
essentially represents the minor-major and major-minor diplotype.
It is also possible that multiple rare variants underlie these findings,
as has been suggested in general for disease associations with
common SNPs [33]. It remains possible that these associations
with locus 1, locus 2 and locus 3 are reflecting correlation with yet
another underlying, untyped variant that alone explains the
altered biology leading to risk. However, biological involvement of
multiple loci appears more likely given that two of these loci
represent two distinct, relevant functional consequences: namely,

locus 1 (the amino acid change at rs16969968) is associated with
altered receptor response to a nicotine agonist in vitro [19], and
locus 3 (rs588765 and correlates) is associated with altered mRNA
levels of CHRNA5 in brain and lung tissue [22,24]. Further
investigation via resequencing, biological/functional assays, and
animal models is needed to dissect the causal biology that underlies
the statistical evidence.
An important open question is the degree to which the
associations between chr15q25 variants and lung cancer are due
to their effects on smoking. When comparing smoking and lung
cancer single-SNP results, the patterns of association (odds ratios
and directions of effect) were similar across the loci studied. Locus
1 is associated with lung cancer even when controlling for amount
smoked per day (p = 1.99610221, OR = 1.31). This result suggests
possible direct genetic effects of locus 1 on this cancer, at least in
the presence of smoking. However, CPD is not a sufficient proxy
for carcinogen exposure [34], and in never-smokers there is a lack
of association between locus 1 and lung cancer [35­37], so it is
possible that more refined adjustment for smoking will reduce or
abolish this association.
For lung cancer, after controlling for categorical CPD and
effects of locus 1, we were not able to definitively demonstrate
association at either locus 2 or locus 3 after correction for multiple
tests. For the mutually adjusted analysis of locus 1 and locus 3 for
lung cancer, we observed the same change in the direction for the
locus 3 odds ratio that we observed in the joint-SNP analysis of
smoking. However, unlike what was seen for smoking, for lung
cancer the magnitude (and significance) of the effects did not
increase. There are several possible reasons for this, including:
chance, the smaller sample size for lung cancer, or qualitative
differences in the relationship between these loci and smoking
behavior versus the relationship between these loci and lung
cancer (after adjusting for smoking quantity). This highlights the
challenges posed when attempting to dissect the contributions of
multiple loci of modest effect on complex, correlated traits. Further
studies, and larger sample sizes, are needed.
For COPD, when controlling for cigarettes-per-day we did not
find evidence for association with any of the loci after correction for
multiple tests. For locus 1, the odds ratio of 1.12 (1.01­1.23) is lower
than for smoking and lung cancer. The COPD analyses were based
on smaller samples than those available for CPD or for lung cancer.
Very recently, three other large smoking genetics consortia
published their meta-analysis findings that confirm locus 1
(representing not only rs16969918 but also rs1051730 and other
SNPs) as the locus most associated with smoking quantity,
genome-wide [12­14]. All three studies used linear regression to
test for association with either quantitative CPD value [14] or
categorical CPD (1­10, 11­20, 21­30, and 31+) [12,13]. Those
consortia also report results from conditional analyses in which a
locus 1 SNP was included as a covariate, paralleling our joint
analyses.
In contrast to our novel finding in CGASP of genome-wide
significance for locus 3 when analyzed jointly with locus 1, none of
the other consortia report strong evidence for locus 3 when paired
with locus 1. In the Oxford-GSK study [13], imputation using
1000 Genomes data detected the most significant single-SNP
association for CPD at the locus 1 SNP rs55853698 (r2.0.96 with
rs16969968). After conditioning on rs55853698, the strongest
residual signal was detected at a locus 2 SNP, rs6495308
(p = 3.9661025; r2 = 0.825 with rs578776 in HapMap CEU);

they do not report the association result for rs588765 in the
conditioned analysis, although it must have been less significant
than 3.9661025. In their single-SNP analysis, rs6495308 (locus 2)
gave a p-value of 2.2610210. Their results for locus 2 are therefore
consistent with our observation that in joint analysis of locus 1 and
locus 2, the significance at locus 2 is reduced compared to the
single-SNP analysis. They do not report on whether the evidence
for locus 1 and locus 3 strengthens in the joint analysis compared
to single-SNP analysis, as we observed in the CGASP datasets.
They do note that there is no obvious residual association with a
third SNP after conditioning on either the pairing of locus 1
(rs16969968) and locus 3 (rs588765), or the pairing of locus 1
(rs55853698) and locus 2 (rs6495308). That result is consistent
with the correlation and haplotype structure of these three loci
discussed previously.
In the ENGAGE study [12], conditioning on the locus 1 SNP
rs1051730 identified residual evidence at rs2869046
(p = 4.861025) and rs2036534 (p = 9.161025), neither of which
is genome-wide significant. Rs2036534 tags locus 2 (r2 = 0.74 with
rs578776 in HapMap CEU) while rs2869046 is only weakly
correlated with locus 3 (r2 = 0.46).
In TAG [14], the conditional analyses indicated residual
association at rs684513 (p =6.361029), rs9788682 (p =1.0661028),
and rs7163730 (p=1.2261028), which attain genome-wide signifi-
cance. These SNPs are each correlated with locus 2, and much less
correlated with locus 3 (r2 =0.7, 0.55 and 0.56 respectively with
rs578776 in HapMap CEU; r2,0.11 with rs588765). It is possible
that differences in samples, phenotype definitions, or analysis methods
may be contributing to the differences between our strong findings for
locus 3 and the three other consortium reports. To further understand
the genetic contributions in this region, more work is needed, and
not only statistical evidence but also biological evidence will be
important.
In summary, our meta-analysis demonstrates significant, robust
association of locus 1, representing the non-synonymous CHRNA5
SNP rs16969968 as well as rs1051730 and rs55853698, with
smoking heaviness across very diverse datasets. Our study also
demonstrates strong evidence that at least one additional distinct
locus in this region affects risk for heavy smoking. In particular, we
have identified for the first time that locus 3 ­ representing the
CHRNA5 expression-associated SNPs rs588765 and correlates ­
surpasses GWAS-level significance for association with heavy
smoking in European-ancestry subjects; this effect is detectable
after adjusting for the effect of rs16969968. This new result for
locus 3 raises the corresponding SNPs (rs588765 and correlates) to
the level of interest already accorded to the two loci which have
previously been detected at GWAS-level significance in single-
SNP analyses: locus 1 (rs16969968 and correlates) and locus 2
(rs578776 and correlates). Our result also has implications for all
genetic association studies, as it illustrates that joint analysis of
SNPs is an important tool for identifying genome-wide significant
effects that, soberingly, may be obscured in single SNP analyses.
Our study used multiple highly correlated SNPs to represent
each of the 4 tested loci, depending on availability in each dataset,
and all subjects were of European ancestry. Hence this study is not
designed to determine which SNP(s), among the highly correlated
SNPs for each locus, are most likely to be biologically involved.
Future work, involving large-scale meta-analysis of other popula-
tions (e.g. Asian or African ancestry) to capitalize on LD
differences between populations, comprehensive functional anno-
tation of genetic variants, DNA re-sequencing and variant
discovery, and functional and animal studies may help narrow
down these large sets of correlated SNPs to the most promising
causal alleles.
