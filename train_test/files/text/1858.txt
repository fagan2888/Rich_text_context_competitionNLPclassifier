Objective To examine co-occurrence of five subtypes of peer victimization. Methods Data were ob-
tained from a national sample of 7,475 US adolescents in grades 6 through 10 in the 2005/2006 Health
Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC) study. Latent class analyses (LCA) were conducted on victimiza-
tion by physical, verbal, social exclusion, spreading rumors, and cyber bullying. Results Three latent clas-
ses were identified, including an all-types victims class (9.7% of males and 6.2% of females), a verbal/
relational victims class (28.1% of males and 35.1% of females), and a nonvictim class (62.2% of males and
58.7% of females). Males were more likely to be all-type victims. There was a graded relationship between
the three latent classes and level of depression, frequency of medically attended injuries, and medicine use,
especially among females. Conclusions Increased co-occurrence of victimization types put adolescents at
greater risks for poorer physical and psychological outcomes.
Key words cyber victimization; latent class analysis; physical and psychological problems; victimization.
Introduction
Peer victimization has been recognized as a significant
problem among children and adolescents because of its
negative influence on physical and psychosocial function-
ing (Gini & Pozzoli, 2009; Hawker & Boulton, 2000).
Substantial research indicates that victims of bullying are
at higher risks for health-related problems such as in-
creased medicine use (Due, Hansen, Merlo, Andersen, &
Holstein, 2007) and injuries (Engstrom, Hallqvist, Moller,
& Laflamme, 2005), as well as social and emotional prob-
lems such as anxiety and depression (Menesini, Modena,
& Tani, 2009).
Several types of peer victimization have been identified
in previous studies, including physical attack, verbal ha-
rassment, social exclusion, spreading rumors, and cyber
bullying (Crick & Grotpeter, 1995; Olweus, 1993; Slonje
& Smith, 2008; Williams & Guerra, 2007). Physical attack
and verbal harassment are generally considered a direct
form of confrontation, whereas social exclusion and
spreading rumors are often considered an indirect
(Bjorkqvist, 1994) or relational (Crick & Grotpeter,
1995) form of bullying. Cyber victimization refers to vic-
timization through the use of computers and cell phones.
It is a new type of victimization that has received growing
interests from researchers (Slonje et al., 2008; Williams
et al., 2007). Previous studies have shown that prevalence
of verbal and relational victimization are higher than that of
physical and cyber victimization (e.g., Wang, Iannotti, &
Nansel, 2009).
Empirical evidence thus far suggests that different
types of victimization are highly correlated and that the
same individuals may be victimized in multiple ways. For
instance, Nylund and colleagues (Nylund, Nishina,
Bellmore, & Graham, 2007) conducted a latent class

analysis (LCA) approach to explore how different types of
victimization were related. Specifically, they included six
dichotomous items measuring physical, verbal and rumor
types of peer victimization. Based on their observed re-
sponses, the adolescents were classified into three ordered
latent classes, including a ``victimized class,'' a ``sometimes
victimized class,'' and a ``nonvictimized class.'' Their study
suggested the existence of a group who may be the targets
of multiple types of bullying. Even though this study was
limited in their inclusion of traditional forms of victimiza-
tion only, as well as their use of a local middle school
sample, it demonstrated promise for using a LCA approach
to study the co-occurrence of various types of
victimization.
With the increasing popularity in use of internet and
cell phones among children and adolescents, cyber bully-
ing has emerged as a new type of victimization. Recent
studies have demonstrated that being a traditional victim
increases the risk of cyber victimization (Li, 2007;
Raskauskas & Stoltz, 2007; Smith et al., 2008), pointing
to the potential existence of a distinct group that is the
target of both traditional and cyber bullying. However, as
most of the studies analyzing the association between tra-
ditional and cyber victimization quantified traditional vic-
timization using a global measure, it remains unclear how
cyber victimization and specific types of traditional victim-
ization are associated and might co-occur in the same
person. One possible reason for the lack of research ad-
dressing this question is that common statistical
approaches assessing relations between categorical vari-
ables (e.g., chi-square statistics) are restricted to including
two to three variables only. To address this gap in research,
the first purpose of our study was to examine the
co-occurrence of victimization from four main types of tra-
ditional bullying (physical, verbal, social exclusion, and
spreading rumors) and from cyber bullying through a
series of LCA models. LCA is a person-based latent variable
approach in which latent classes can be identified based on
participants' observed response to multiple categorical or
continuous variables. A previous study has shown the ad-
vantages to use LCA models to explore relationships
among involvement in several subtypes of victimization
(Nylund, Nishina et al., 2007). For instance, it is a
model based on probabilities, so the model can be repli-
cated with an independent sample. The current study ex-
tends previous studies by examining cyber victimization
and most common types of traditional victimization in a
nationally representative sample.
Numerous studies suggest that victimization may
occur among certain groups of adolescents more than
others depending on gender, grade, and race/ethnicity.
For instance, male adolescents are more likely than
female adolescents to experience physical and verbal vic-
timization, whereas female adolescents are more likely to
experience relational victimization (Bjorkqvist, 1994;
Finkelhor, 2007; Owens, Shute, & Slee, 2000; Peskin,
Tortolero, & Markham, 2006). Previous research indicates
that the prevalence of victimization decreases with age
(Carlyle & Steinman, 2007), and may be lower in African
Americans and Hispanics (Juvonen, Graham, & Schuster,
2003; Nansel et al., 2001; Spriggs, Iannotti, Nansel, &
Haynie, 2007). Given potential variations by gender,
grade, and race/ethnicity, the second purpose of our
study was to identify the targets of multiple types of vic-
timization based on adolescents' demographic
characteristics.
Previous studies have consistently suggested that ex-
perience with peer victimization increases the risk of a va-
riety of adverse physical and psychological outcomes
(Menesini et al., 2009). However, it is not known if victim-
ization from multiple types of bullying would place adoles-
cents at even greater risk for adverse health outcomes. In
their latent class analysis, Nylund and colleagues (Nylund,
Nishina et al., 2007) presented depression scores across
the three latent classes and found that the classification of
LCA was superior in terms of predictive validity compared
to other methods such as using cutoffs on the composite
raw scores. To validate the latent classification obtained in
the current study, four health-related outcomes were com-
pared across the extracted latent classes, including depres-
sion, medically attended injuries, and medicine use for
sleeplessness and nervousness.
The present study applied a series of LCA models with
three main purposes: (a) to examine the co-occurrence of
five subtypes of victimization, including cyber victimization
and four traditional types of victimization; (b) to explore
demographic characteristics across the latent classes; and
(c) to compare physical and psychological outcomes across
the latent classes.
Methods
Participants and Procedure
Data were obtained from the Health Behavior in
School-aged Children (HBSC) 2005/2006 study conducted
in the United States. The U.S. HBSC is conducted in col-
laboration with the World Health Organization
cross-national study (Currie, Nic Gabhainn, Godeau, &
International HBSC Network Coordinating Committee,
2009), which collects information about adolescents'
health behaviors and their social contexts. The U.S.
sample was selected through a complex survey design,
1104 Wang, Iannotti, Luk, and Nansel
including stratification (i.e., census regions and grades as
strata), clustering (i.e., school districts as primary sampling
units), and weighting (i.e., controlling for nonresponse and
oversampling of African American and Hispanic minority
groups). The software used for the current study, Mplus
5.1 (Muthe
´n & Muthe
´n, 1998), took into account this
sampling design in the analyses by its complex survey
data features, including stratification, clustering, and un-
equal probabilities of selection.
Data were collected through anonymous self-report
questionnaires distributed in the classroom, with a student
response rate of 85%. Youth assent and parental consent
were obtained as required by the participating school dis-
tricts. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the Eunice Kennedy
Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development.
Measures
Demographic Variables
Demographic variables included gender, grade (6 though
10), and race/ethnicity (Caucasian, African-American,
Hispanic, and other).
Peer Victimization
Experience of victimization was measured by the victim
items from the Revised Olweus Bully/Victim
Questionnaire (Olweus, 1996). The reliability and validity
of this questionnaire have been demonstrated in previous
studies and the items used in the present study were de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (Olweus, 1996; Solberg &
Olweus, 2003). The participants were asked how often
they were bullied in the past couple of months. Physical
victimization was measured by one item--``being hit,
kicked, pushed, shoved around, or locked indoors.''
Verbal victimization was measured by three items--
``being called mean names, made fun of, or teased in a
hurtful way;'' ``being called mean names and comments
about race or color;'' and ``being called mean names and
comments about religion.'' Victimization through socially
exclusion was measured by one item--``being left out of
things on purpose, excluded from their group of friends, or
completely ignored.'' Victimization by rumor spreading
was measured with one item--``being the target of other
students' lies or false rumors.'' Cyber victimization was
measured by two items--``being bullied by others using
computers, e-mail messages, and pictures'' and ``being bul-
lied by others using cell phones.'' Response options were
``I have not been bullied in this way in the past couple of
months,'' ``only once or twice,'' ``2 or 3 times a month,''
``about once a week,'' and ``several times a week.'' Based
on these items, five dichotomous victimization variables
(physical, verbal, social exclusion, rumor spreading, and
cyber victimization) were created with two categories for
each variable: involved and noninvolved with uninvolved
indicating ``never'' in the last couple of months. These five
variables were included in the LCA models.
Depression
Six items were used to measure depressive feelings and
behaviors, which were previously validated with this age
group (Dahlberg, Toal, Swahn, & Behrens, 2005;
Orpinas, 1993). Participants were asked how often in the
past 30 days they: (a) were very sad; (b) were grouchy or
irritable, or in a bad mood; (c) felt hopeless about the
future; (d) felt like not eating or eating more than usual;
(e) slept a lot more or a lot less than usual; and (f) had
difficulty concentrating on their school work. Responses
were coded one to five: ``never,'' ``seldom,'' ``sometimes,''
``often,'' and ``always.'' This scale showed desirable reli-
ability (Cronbach's a ¼ .80). The mean of items was used
with a higher score indicating higher level of depressive
tendencies.
Medically Attended Injuries
Students were asked how many times during the last
12 months they had been injured and had to be treated
by a doctor or nurse. Responses options were coded 1­5:
``I was not injured in the past 12 months,'' ``1 time,''
``2 times,'' ``3 times,'' and ``4 times or more.''
Medicine Use for Sleeping Problems and for
Nervousness
Students in grades 7­10 were asked about their medicine
use during the past month for (a) difficulties in getting to
sleep, and (b) nervousness. The response options were
``no,'' ``yes, once,'' and ``yes, several times.'' The each
item was dichotomized into yes and no, and percentage
of ``yes'' was compared across latent classes.
Statistical Analysis
A series of latent class models were used and all analyses
were conducted using Mplus version 5 (Muthe
´n &
Muthe
´n, 1998). The first step was to choose the optimal
number of classes by specifying separate LCA models with
various numbers of classes. Model solutions on choosing
the appropriate number of classes were evaluated based on
a comparison between several statistical criteria, including
Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information
criterion (BIC), sample-size-adjusted Bayesian information
criterion (ABIC), bivariate residuals (i.e., residuals >1.96),
and entropy. Suggested by a recent simulation study, we
Subtypes of Peer Victimization 1105
gave the most weight to the BIC as it may provide the most
reliable indicator of true number of classes (Nylund,
Asparouhov, & Muthe
´n, 2007). To explore if there
were different classes or different number of classes ex-
tracted from male and female populations, the analyses
were initially conducted separately by gender. After the
optimal number of classes was chosen, grade, gender,
and race/ethnicity were included as covariates. With class
membership as outcome and demographic variables as in-
dicators, the model is analogous to a logistic regression or
multinomial logistic regression model. In the same model
of LCA with covariates, the AUXILIARY option with the
e-setting was used to test the equality of the means of
the four outcome variables across classes (Muthe
´n &
Muthe
´n, 1998). The posterior probability-based multiple
imputations were used to conduct paired mean compari-
sons. For binary variables such as the two medicine
use variables, proportions were computed and compared
across latent classes. As the medicine use variables
were only included in the survey for grades 7 through
10, youth in grade 6 were treated as missing in these
comparisons.
Results
Sample Characteristic
Among the 7,508 adolescents who completed the survey
with the victimization items, 33 were excluded due to
missing information on demographic variables, resulting
in an analytic sample of 7,475. The sample consisted of
48.5% males, 42.2% Caucasian Americans, 18.7%
African-Americans, and 26.4% Hispanic Americans.
The mean age of the sample was 14.2 years, with a SD
of 1.42.
Descriptive Statistics: Prevalence Rates and
Co-occurrence of Any Two Forms of
Victimization
The prevalence rates of involvement in the five types of
victimization were 13.2% (male: 17.8%; female: 8.8%)
for physical, 36.9% (male: 38.5%; female: 35.5%) for
verbal, 25.8% (male: 24.0%; female: 27.6%) for social ex-
clusion, 32.1% (male: 27.6%; female: 36.3%) for rumor
spreading, and 10.1% (male: 9.9%; female: 10.4%) for
cyber form. Among the victims of each type, the percent-
ages of involvement in other types of victimization are re-
ported in Table I. The descriptive statistics of
co-occurrence of traditional and cyber victimization
showed that among victims of traditional bullying (i.e., if
one was bullied by at least one type of traditional bullying),
17.8% also reported experience with cyber victimization
(male: 20.4%; female: 15.4%). Conversely, among cyber
victims, 95.1% were also traditional victims (male:
96.1%; female: 93.8%).
Latent Classes Indicating Patterns of
Victimization Bullying Forms
LCAs were conducted on the five victimization variables
with two, three and four classes specified. The model fit
statistics are reported in Table II, which includes AIC, BIC,
ABIC, number of significant bivariate residuals, and entro-
py. The best fitting models, as indicated by the BIC, were
the three-class models, both for all individuals and for sub-
group analyses by gender. Other criteria such as ABIC and
entropy values for the three-class models were also
acceptable.
The prevalence of each class and the item probabilities
for the three-class models are shown in Figure 1. For each
class, the item probability indicates the probability of an
individual being victimized by the specific bullying behav-
ior. The following three classes were extracted: Class 1:
all-types victims--a class of individuals with high probabil-
ities of being victimized by the four traditional bullying
behaviors and a moderately high probability of being
victimized by cyber bullying; Class 2: verbal/relational
victims--a class of individuals with a moderately
high probability of verbal, social exclusion, and rumor
spreading type of victimization and relatively low probabil-
ities of physical and cyber victimization; and Class 3:
Non-victims--a class of individuals with minimal probabil-
ities of being victimized by any bullying behavior.
Figure 1 shows that the overall pattern of involvement
in the five types of victimization was same across gender in
each latent class. For both genders, the three latent classes
were ordered classes (Nylund, Asparouhov et al., 2007), in
that the probabilities for all of the items were highest for
Class 1, followed by Class 2 and Class 3. The group of
all-types victims, i.e., Class 1, were more likely to be targets
of all five bullying behaviors, including verbal/relational,
than the Class 2 verbal/relational victims, while the Class
1 group had the lowest probability across all bullying
behaviors.
Demographic Characteristics of Each Latent
Class
The results of the 3-class LCA with demographic covariates
are reported in Table III, with model fit statistics reported
in Table II. In the model for all individuals, covariates in-
cluded gender (male as referent), grade (grade 10 as refer-
ent), and race/ethnicity (Caucasian as referent). In the
model for males and females separately, covariates includ-
ed grade and race/ethnicity. As there were a total of three
1106 Wang, Iannotti, Luk, and Nansel
classes, the model was analogous to a multinomial logistic
regression of latent classes on demographic variables. Class
3, the category of non-victims, was set as the reference
group.
Gender
Compared to females, males were more likely to be
all-types victims (Class 1). There was a trend for higher
proportion of Class 2 compared to Class 3 among females,
but the gender difference only approached significance
(p < .10).
Grade
Compared to adolescents in grade 10, students in grade
6 through 8 were more likely to be in Class 1 than Class 3.
Similar results were found for males and females except
that the difference between 10th and 9th grade was also
significant in males. There was no grade difference in
Class 2 between grade 10 and any other grade for all
individuals. However, gender differences were found
when males and females were analyzed separately.
Specifically, males in grade 6 though 8 and females in
grade 6 were more likely to be in Class 2 compared to
grade 10.
Race/Ethnicity
No racial/ethnic differences were found with the only ex-
ception that Hispanic adolescents were less likely to be in
Class 2 compared to Class 3 when males and females were
analyzed together.
Health-related Outcomes
The means of the four health outcome variables for the
three latent classes are plotted in Figure 2. For each vari-
able, three mean or percentage paired comparisons were
conducted: the comparison of nonvictims (Class 3) with
verbal/relational victims (Class 2); comparison of
non-victims (Class 3) with all-types victims (Class 1); and
comparison of verbal/relational victims (Class 2) with
all-types victims (Class 1).
Depression
For both males and females, all three paired mean compar-
isons showed strong evidence of significant differences in

bullying, respectively.

11.4%; females: 18.1%), or nonvictims (males: 8.8%; fe-
males: 12.6%). Furthermore, the comparison between
female verbal/relational victims and female nonvictims
also lead to significant difference.
Medicine Use for Nervousness
Similar results were found for medicine use for nervous-
ness. All three comparisons showed significant differences
except for the comparison of verbal/relational victims and
non-victims for males.
Discussion
The current study is the first study to examine the
co-occurrence of five subtypes of victimization, including
cyber victimization and four traditional victimization sub-
types in a nationally representative sample of US adoles-
cents. We found that different types of victimization do
co-occur among certain individuals and these patterns
could be best described by a three-class model, with one
class of adolescents who were targets of all five bullying
behaviors (Class 1), another class who were marked by
verbal/relational victimization (Class 2), and a final class
that had minimal experience of any victimization (Class 3).
The demographic characteristics of each latent class were
described accordingly. As a validation of the classification,
level of depression, frequency of medically attended inju-
ries, medicine use for sleeping problems, and medicine use
for nervousness were compared across the three latent clas-
ses. In general, the all-types victims reported higher depres-
sion, more injuries, and more medicine use for sleeping
problems and nervousness than the verbal/relational vic-
tims, followed by the nonvictims.
Class 1 adolescents were more likely to be victimized
by all five bullying behaviors, thus they can be considered
as ``all-types victims.'' The proportion of Class 1 was 9.7%
for males and 6.2% for females. Further results of LCA with
demographic covariates showed that males were more
likely to be all-types victims than females. The gender

Subtypes of Peer Victimization 1109
difference may reflect a higher prevalence of physical vic-
timization among males (Owens et al., 2000). For both
genders, the overall age trend was a decrease from grade
6 to 10, which was consistent with previous studies
(Carlyle & Steinman, 2007). No racial/ethnic differences
were found in involvement of victimization in Class 1.
Class 2 adolescents had moderately high probability of
being victimized by verbal, social exclusion or rumor
spreading types of behaviors and low probability of phys-
ical or cyber victimization, thus they can be considered as
``verbal/relational victims.'' When males and females were
analyzed separately, 28.1% of males and 35.1% of females
were classified as verbal/relational victims. Compared to
10th-grade males, males in grades 6, 7, and 8 had a
higher relative proportion of Class 2 than Class 3 males.
Among females, on the other hand, only females in grade 6
had a significantly higher relative proportion of Class 2 to
Class 3 females compared to females in grade 10. Only one
racial/ethnic difference was found in involvement of vic-
timization in Class 2 where Hispanics were less likely than
Caucasians to be verbal/relational victims.
Results of paired comparisons on four physical and
psychological outcomes were consistent with previous
studies showing that experience with victimization was as-
sociated with higher level of depression, increased injuries
and medicine use (Due et al., 2007; Engstrom et al., 2005;
Menesini et al., 2009). More important, our results suggest
that the more types of victimization the adolescents expe-
rienced, the poorer physical and psychological distress they
may demonstrate, especially for girls (Figure 2). For both
genders, there was strong evidence that the all-types vic-
tims reported higher depression than the verbal/relational
victims, followed by the nonvictims. Strikingly, 24.1% of
all-types male victims and 30.0% of all-types female victims
reported using medicines for sleeping problems, which was
much higher than the other two latent classes. Similar re-
sults were also found for medicine use for nervousness.
These results suggest the severe effects of experiencing vic-
timization from multiple types of bullying.
The classification observed suggest three patterns of
relationship with regard to cyber victimization and the
four types of traditional victimization. First, involvement
in any two different types of victimization are correlated,
given the existence of Class 1, a group that is the target of
all types of bullying behaviors. Second, the associations
among verbal and relational types of victimization are

highly correlated, given the high or moderately high item
probabilities for verbal and relational victimization in both
Class 1 and Class 2. As verbal victimization (measured by
name calling in the current study), social exclusion and
rumor spreading types of victimization are not mutually
exclusive, the results suggest that many verbal types of
bullying such as being called names and teased may be
experienced by victims who are socially excluded from a
group. Third, our results suggest that if a student is vic-
timized by physical or cyber bullying (either in Class 1 or
Class 2), it is very likely that s/he is also victimized by
verbal and relational bullying. However, a student may ex-
perience verbal and relational bullying without being sub-
jected to physical or cyber bullying.
It is important to note several limitations in this study.
First, due to the cross-sectional nature of the survey, we
cannot make causal inferences on the associations between
the classification of the three groups and the health-related
outcomes. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine in-
volvement in latent classes over time and to determine the
temporal sequence of the classification and their correlates.
Second, we assessed injuries due to all causes, not speci-
fically bullying; future studies should differentiate the
causes of injuries. Finally, we only examined latent classes
of victimization in the current study. Left unanswered is
whether there are groups of individuals (latent classes) that
differentially participate in particular types of both bullying
perpetration and victimization and, if so, the characteristics
of individuals in these groups. Future studies should ex-
amine the co-occurrence of different types of bullying per-
petration and victimization.
The three-class results of the LCA models found in this
study provides a different but complimentary view to that
obtained by Nylund, Asparouhov et al. (2007), which iden-
tified a victimized class, a sometimes victimized class and a
nonvictimized class based on physical, verbal and rumor
types of victimization. The current study contributes to the
literature and extends previous studies in at least four
ways. First, we examined the co-occurrence of victimiza-
tion in five different types, including four main types of
traditional victimization, and a relatively new form, i.e.,
cyber victimization. Second, we used a large-scale nation-
ally representative sample with sufficient representation
from multiple age and racial/ethnic groups. The sample
allowed us to analyze demographic variability in extracted
latent classes and plot the proportion of each class by de-
mographic characteristics. Third, the LCA analytical strat-
egy applied in the current study is a person-centered
analysis, which is well suitable for examining patterns of
relations among involvement in a set of behaviors. Fourth,
we compared a variety of physical and psychological
outcomes across the latent classes. The result of graded
association demonstrates the predictive validity of the clas-
sification in the current study.
Conclusions
Different types of bullying victimization appear to co-occur
among US adolescents. The patterns of involvement in vic-
timization can be best represented by a three-class model,
with one class of all-types victims, a class of verbal/rela-
tional victims, and a class of non-victims. Victimization
from all types of bullying (Class 1) was more common in
younger and male adolescents and decreased with age in
both males and females. Developmental patterns for vic-
timization from verbal/relational bullying (Class 2) differed
across gender and there was only marginal significance for
gender differences. Given the positive association between
involvement in types of victimization and physical and psy-
chological problems, intervention efforts should address
various symptoms among victims of bullying and especially
those who suffer from multiple types of victimization.
