ABSTRACT
Hip fracture incidence appears to be declining in the United States, but changes in bone mineral density (BMD) of the population have
not been evaluated. We used femur BMD data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005­2006 to
estimate the prevalence of low femoral BMD in adults age 50 years and older and compared it with estimates from NHANES III (1988­
1994). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry systems (pencil-beam geometry in NHANES III, fan-beam geometry in NHANES 2005­2006)
were used to measure femur BMD, and World Health Organization (WHO) definitions of low BMD were used to categorize skeletal status.
In 2005­2006, 49% of older US women had osteopenia and 10% had osteoporosis at the femur neck. In men, 30% had femur neck
osteopenia and 2% had femur neck osteoporosis. An estimated 5.3 million older men and women had osteoporosis at the femur neck,
and 34.5 million more had osteopenia in 2005­2006. When compared with NHANES III, the age-adjusted prevalence of femur neck
osteoporosis in NHANES 2005­2006 was lower in men (by 3 percentage units) and women (by 7 percentage units) overall and among
non-Hispanic whites. Changes in body mass index or osteoporosis medication use between surveys did not fully explain the decline in
osteoporosis. Owing to the increase in the number of older adults in the US population, however, more older adults had low femur neck
BMD (osteoporosis þ osteopenia) in 2005­2006 than in 1988­1994. Thus, despite the decline in prevalence, the estimated number of
affected older adults in 2005­2006 remained high. ß 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

Introduction
Recent fracture incidence data suggest that hip fracture rates
may be declining in the United States,(1,2) but whether this
decline is associated with improvements in bone mineral density
(BMD) or due to other factors is unknown. The most recent
nationally representative estimates of osteoporosis prevalence,
based on femur BMD data from the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994), were
published a decade ago.(3) Total-body and regional BMD data
from NHANES 1999­2004 have been published,(4) but these
cannot provide osteoporosis estimates for the femur neck, which
has been proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO)(5)
as the skeletal site that should be used for the description of
osteoporosis in populations. To address these data gaps,
proximal femur bone density measurements by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were included in the continuous
NHANES beginning in 2005. Not only can these data can provide
more recent estimates of the prevalence of osteoporosis based
on the recommended femur neck skeletal site, but they also can
provide estimates of osteoporosis prevalence at the total hip, the
skeletal site on which the osteoporosis objective in Healthy
People 2010 is based.(6) Finally, these data allow a comparison of
osteoporosis prevalence in representative samples of the
noninstitutionalized US population that were assessed at two
different time points so that changes in bone status over time
can be examined. The specific objectives of this study are to
(1) assess the prevalence of low bone density at the femur neck
and total hip in US adults aged 50 years and older in 2005­2006,
(2) compare the prevalence of low total hip BMD in 2005­2006
with target prevalence goals identified for the population in
Healthy People 2010, and (3) contrast the prevalence of low bone
density at the femur neck and total hip in 2005­2006 with those
observed in NHANES III.

Methods
Sample
The NHANES are conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to
assess the health and nutritional status of large representative
cross-sectional samples of the noninstitutionalized civilian US
population. In NHANES III, a nationally representative sample was
obtained in two 3-year cycles between 1988 and 1994. Starting in
1999, data from a nationally representative sample have been
collected each year, but data are released for 2-year periods to
protect confidentiality and increase statistical reliability. The
present study was based on data collected in NHANES 2005­
2006. In each NHANES, data were collected via household
interviews and direct standardized physical examinations
conducted in specially equipped mobile examination centers.(7,8)
All procedures in both surveys were approved by the NCHS
Institutional Review Board, and written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects.
NHANES III and NHANES 2005­2006 were designed to provide
reliable estimates for three race/ethnic groups: non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans. Race and
ethnicity were self-reported by the participants. A total of 10,995
adults age 50 years and older were eligible to participate in
NHANES III. Of the eligible sample, 8654 (79%) were interviewed,
and 7155 (65%) were examined. The present study uses data for
6401 adults age 50 years and older with valid nonmissing femur
BMD data from NHANES III, which represents 58% of the sample
in this age range who were originally selected for NHANES III,
74% of the participants in this age range who were interviewed,
and 89% of those who received physical examinations. A total of
3157 adults age 50 years and older were eligible to participate in
NHANES 2005­2006. Of these, 2214 (70%) were interviewed, and
2119 (68%) were examined. The analytic sample from NHANES
2005­2006 was limited to 1614 adults age 50 years and older
with valid, nonmissing femur BMD data, which represents 51% of
the participants in this age range who were eligible to participate
in the survey, 73% of the interviewed participants, and 76% of
those who received physical examinations.
Variables
As described elsewhere,(9) femur BMD was measured in NHANES
2005­2006 with Hologic QDR 4500A fan-beam densitometers
(Hologic, Inc., Bedford, MA, USA) using Discovery version 12.4
software. Scanning was done in the fast mode. In NHANES III,
femur BMD was measured with Hologic QDR 1000 pencil-beam
densitometers.(10) Rigorous quality-control (QC) programs were
employed in both surveys, which included use of anthropo-
morphic phantoms and review of each QC and respondent scan
at a central site (Department of Radiology, University of California
San Francisco in NHANES 2005­2006 and Department of
Diagnostic Radiology, Mayo Clinic in NHANES III).(9,10) In both
surveys, the left hip was scanned unless there was a history of
previous fracture or surgery.
To address the potential impact of the change in DXA
methodology between surveys, a literature search was
performed to identify the magnitude of the difference that
might be expected when the same individuals were measured
on both scanner types.(18­21) The largest discrepancy between
the two scanners found in published studies was a difference
of Æ 3% at either the femur neck or total hip.(18,21) Accordingly,
the BMD values of each respondent from NHANES 2005­2006
were raised or lowered by 3%. Estimates of osteoporosis, as
defined below, that were based on the adjusted BMD values
from NHANES 2005­2006 then were calculated and compared
with the prevalence estimates from NHANES III (data not shown).
Although the magnitude of the prevalence estimates was altered
by this adjustment, conclusions regarding the differences in
prevalence between surveys were the same as when based on
the observed BMD values except in one case (when BMD was
lowered by 3% in men). As a result, the observed BMD values
from both surveys were used in the present study without
adjustment for the difference in DXA methods.
In the present study, BMD data at the femur neck and total hip
were analyzed. The femur neck was chosen because it has been
proposed as the reference skeletal site for defining osteoporosis
in epidemiologic studies.(5) The total hip was included because it
is the skeletal site used in the Healthy People 2010 objective
related to osteoporosis.(6) Definitions of osteopenia and
osteoporosis were based on criteria outlined by WHO in 1994(11):
Osteopenia: BMD between 1 standard deviation (SD) and 2.5 SD
below the mean of the young reference group.
Osteoporosis: BMD 2.5 SD or more below the mean of the young
reference group.
As recommended more recently by the WHO,(5) 20- to 29-year-
old non-Hispanic white women from NHANES III(3) were used
as the reference group to derive these cutoff values for men
and women in both surveys. The specific NHANES III cutoff
values used to define osteopenia were 0.561 to 0.74 g/cm2 and
0.641 to 0.82 g/cm2 for the femur neck and total hip,
respectively.(3) The thresholds for osteoporosis were 0.56 g/
cm2 or less and 0.64 g/cm2 or less for the femur neck and total
hip, respectively.(3)
Two potential explanatory factors related to secular trends in
BMD were examined in the present study: body mass index (BMI)
and use of osteoporosis medications. These variables were
chosen because they have been shown to be strongly related to
BMD,(12,13) and there is also evidence that changes have occurred
in the population since NHANES III.(14­16) BMI was calculated as
body weight (kilograms) divided by height (meters squared). In
both surveys, body weight was measured to the nearest 0.01 kg
using an electronic load-cell scale, and standing height was
measured with a fixed stadiometer.
Osteoporosis medication users were defined as those who
self-reported having been treated for osteoporosis and/or were
currently taking the prescription medications described below.
Data to define users of osteoporosis medications were collected
in a comparable manner in both surveys. Respondents who
self-reported having been diagnosed with osteoporosis by a
physician were asked if they had been treated for it. In addition,
all respondents, regardless of whether they had self-reported
having been diagnosed with osteoporosis, showed the contain-
ers for all current prescription medications to the interviewer,
who recorded the name of the product. Medications were

assigned standard generic names and four-digit generic codes
using the Physicians' GenRx(17) in NHANES III. The December
2007 Multum Lexicon Drug Database (Cerner Multum, Inc.,
Denver CO; www.multum.com/Lexicon.htm) was used to assign
generic drug names and codes in NHANES 2005­2006.
Osteoporosis medications were defined as medications
included in a recent systematic review of the comparative
effectiveness of treatments to prevent osteoporotic fractures.(13)
In NHANES III, these included calcitonin, calcitriol, ergocalciferol,
etidronate, sodium fluoride, tamoxifen, calcium acetate, and sex
hormones (i.e., estrogen and testosterone, as defined below). In
NHANES 2005­2006, they included bisphosphonates (e.g.,
alendronate, risedronate, etidronate, pamidronate, tiludronate,
ibandronate, and zolendronate), calcitonin, calcitriol, fluoride,
raloxifene, tamoxifen, tibolone, strontium ranelate, parathyroid
hormone, teriparatide, and sex hormones (i.e., estrogen and
testosterone). The Multum drug therapeutic category codes for
estrogen and testosterone were used to identify the relevant sex
hormone treatments in NHANES 2005­2006. Generic drugs
corresponding to these Multum drug therapeutic codes were
considered to be in these categories in NHANES III as well.
``Estrogens'' included estradiol, estradiol valerate, estrogenic
substances, conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens (alone
and with methyltestosterone), estropipate, ethinyl estradiol
(alone or with ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, norethin-
drone, norethindrone acetate, or desogestrel), diethylstilbesterol
(alone or with disphosphate), fluoxymesterone, and quinestrol.
``Testosterones'' included testosterone, testosterone cypionate,
stanozolol, and nandrolone decanoate.
Education was included as a variable in order to make
comparisons with subgroups identified in the osteoporosis
objective in Healthy People 2010.(6) Education was defined as
numbers of years of schooling completed and was categorized
as less than high school, high school, and more than high school
to be consistent with categories used in the Healthy People 2010
osteoporosis objective.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1, SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN (version 9.03, Research Triangle
Institute, NC, USA). All analyses used sample weights and took
into account the complex design of the survey. When multiple
comparisons of estimates between groups were made, a
Bonferoni correction was used.
BMD means by age and race/ethnicity were calculated for
NHANES 2005­2006 using linear regression and adjusting for the
other characteristic in the model. The prevalence of low BMD at
the femur neck and total hip in 2005­2006 was calculated by sex
and age group, and differences by age and sex were tested using
logistic regression. Prevalence estimates for the total population
and by race/ethnicity were age standardized to the US Census
2000 population estimates when not provided by detailed age
groups. Estimates of the number of older US adults with poor
skeletal status were calculated by multiplying the unadjusted
prevalences for age 50þ by Census Current Population Survey
estimates of the noninstitutionalized US population for 2005­
2006 (www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nhanes_cps_totals.
htm).
Changes in the prevalence of low femur BMD between
NHANES III and NHANES 2005­2006 were examined by
calculating the age-standardized prevalence in each survey for
the total population age 50 years and older and by sex and race/
ethnicity. Differences between age-standardized prevalences
were tested using a t test. Differences between the two surveys
also were tested using logistic regression models that included
age and the survey time period.
Secondary analyses were done to assess the potential impact
of changes in BMI and osteoporosis medications on the observed
difference in prevalence of femur neck osteoporosis. These
analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity in order to avoid
potential confounding by this variable in the relationships.
The analyses were limited to non-Hispanic whites owing to
statistically unreliable prevalence estimates of osteoporosis and/
or medication use in the other groups. To assess the potential
impact of differences in BMI and medication use, the prevalences
before and after adjusting for those two factors were calculated
using logistic regression models that also included age and the
survey time period as variables.
Results
Mean femur neck and total hip BMD by age, sex, and race/
ethnicity are shown in Table 1 for adults age 50 years and older
after adjusting for the other variables shown in the table. Age
was significantly negatively related to BMD overall at the femur
neck (beta ¼ ­0.0032 and ­0.0050 for men and women,
respectively, p < .001) and total hip (beta ¼ ­0.0027 and
­0.0056 for men and women, respectively, p < .001). However,
the sexes differed in regard to the specific pattern of differences
between successive decades. In women, mean BMD was
significantly lower in each successive age decade at both
skeletal sites. In men, however, only the difference between 60 to
69 years and 70 to 79 years reached statistical significance at
either skeletal site. Race/ethnicity also was related significantly to
BMD at both femur sites. Non-Hispanic blacks had a significantly
higher age-adjusted mean BMD than whites at both skeletal sites
in both sexes (see Table 1). Age-adjusted mean femur neck BMD
was significantly higher in Mexican-American women than non-
Hispanic white women, but age-adjusted mean total hip BMD
did not differ significantly between these two groups of women.
Among men, non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans had
similar age-adjusted mean BMDs at both skeletal sites.
The crude, or unadjusted, prevalence and estimated millions
of older adults (all races combined) with osteoporosis and
osteopenia at both femur sites in 2005­2006 by sex are shown in
Table 2. Forty-nine percent of older women and 30% of older
men had osteopenia at the femur neck, whereas 10% of women
and 2% of men had osteoporosis at this site. The prevalence of
low BMD was lower at the total hip; for example, among older
women, 36% had osteopenia, and 7 percent had osteoporosis.
Multiplying these prevalences by 2005­2006 Census Current
Population Survey estimates revealed that roughly 40 million
older adults had low BMD at the femur neck (34.5 million with
osteopenia þ 5.3 million with osteoporosis). Comparable
estimates for women at the total hip are 0.3 million with
66 Journal of Bone and Mineral Research LOOKER ET AL.
osteoporosis and 8.3 million with osteopenia. The number of
older men with total hip osteoporosis could not be reliably
estimated, but 1.4 million were estimated to have osteopenia at
the total hip.
Estimates of total hip osteoporosis in 2005­2006 are
compared with targets set by the osteoporosis objective in
Healthy People 2010 in Fig. 1. The observed prevalences
achieved 100% to 105% of the target reduction set for this
objective depending on the demographic category considered.
Age-adjusted estimates of osteoporosis and osteopenia
prevalence at both femur sites are compared between NHANES
2005­2006 and NHANES III by age, sex, and race/ethnicity in
Table 3. The prevalence of osteoporosis declined between
surveys in both sexes overall, as well as among non-Hispanic
white men and women. The decline was larger among women
than men; for example, the prevalence of femur neck
osteoporosis was 7 percentage units lower in NHANES 2005­
2006 than in NHANES III among women versus 3 percentage
units lower in men. However, the prevalence of osteoporosis was
similar in the two surveys in non-Hispanic black women and also
did not differ significantly between surveys among Mexican-
American women, although the estimates tended to be lower in
2005­2006 (see Table 3). Estimates could not be compared
between surveys among non-Hispanic black or Mexican-
American men owing to a lack of statistically reliable estimates
for 2005­2006.

In contrast, the prevalence of osteopenia did not differ
between surveys in any group except Mexican-American
women, in whom the prevalence in 2005­2006 was significantly
lower at the total hip (see Table 3). The lack of difference in
osteopenia between surveys despite a decline in osteoporosis
may be due to the location of the osteoporosis and osteopenia
cutoff values in the BMD distribution coupled with differences in
the shape of the BMD distributions between the two surveys. The
cutoff values for osteoporosis fall in the tail region of the BMD
distribution, where differences in the BMD distribution between
the surveys were more pronounced. The cutoff values for
osteopenia fall more in the center of the BMD distribution, where
differences between surveys were less pronounced.
Secondary analyses were performed to assess the impact of
changes in BMI and medication use that might underlie the
observed difference in osteoporosis between NHANES III and
NHANES 2005­2006. Figure 2 provides a comparison of femur
neck osteoporosis prevalence between NHANES III and NHANES
2005­2006 before and after adjusting for BMI and medication
use differences in the two surveys. Adjusting for these two
factors had almost no impact on prevalence estimates, which
remained significantly lower in 2005­2006.
Discussion
The prevalence of osteoporosis, whether defined by femur neck
or total hip BMD, appears to have declined between 1988­1994
and 2005­2006 in older US adults. The overall decline is
consistent with the decline in hip fracture incidence that has
been observed in other national and community-based studies

in this country over the same time period.(1,2) This decline results
in reduced prevalence estimates that meet or exceed the
reductions set as the target in Healthy People 2010.(6) The decline
is most evident among non-Hispanic whites. Smaller changes
were observed among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans that did not reach statistical significance possibly
owing to their smaller sample sizes in NHANES 2005­2006.
Nonetheless, the estimated reduction in osteoporosis prevalence
observed among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans in
2005­2006 met the targets set for these groups in Healthy
People 2010.
Despite the apparent decline in low femur BMD between
NHANES III and NHANES 2005­2006, the estimated number of
affected older adults remains high. For example, an estimated 5.3
million older men and women had osteoporosis at the femur
neck, and 34.5 million had osteopenia in 2005­2006. Comparable
figures for 1988­1994 from NHANES III were 7.3 million with
femur neck osteoporosis and 26.3 million with femur neck
osteopenia.(3) Thus the increase in the number of older adults
in the US population led to more older adults having low
femur neck BMD (osteoporosis þ osteopenia) in 2005­2006
(39.8 million) than in 1988­1994 (33.6 million) despite the decline
in osteoporosis prevalence.
The decline in femoral osteoporosis did not appear to be
strongly associated with two bone-related factors known to
have changed in the population between the two time periods
examined: an increase in BMI(14,15) and approval of new medi-
cations (e.g., several bisphosphonates and teriparatide) to
prevent and treat osteoporosis.(13,16) We had previously
projected that the increase in BMI was unlikely to significantly
reduce the prevalence of osteoporosis in older women despite
its strong relationship with BMD(12) because the increase in
overweight was confined to a fairly small proportion of the total
population of older women.(22) The present results support our
earlier projections. The lack of impact of medication use in the
present study also may stem in part from the small increase in
use: 10% of our NHANES III sample compared with 16% of our
NHANES 2005­2006 sample were currently taking prescription
osteoporosis medications or reported ever receiving treatment
for osteoporosis. Not unexpectedly, the type of medications
differed between surveys, being almost exclusively estrogen in
the NHANES III and almost exclusively bisphosphonates in the
NHANES 2005­2006. Whether these two drug classes have
similar effects on femur BMD is not certain because, to our
knowledge, head-to-head randomized clinical trials have not
been conducted. Meta-analyses of randomized trials of each
class separately have been performed, however. Between-trial
comparisons must be interpreted with caution owing to the
potential impact of variability in study designs, but the meta-
analysis results suggest that these two drug classes may have
similar effects on femur BMD.(23) Furthermore, six head-to-head
randomized clinical trials found no difference in fracture
incidence in patients using these two drug classes.(13)
Differences in the DXA technology used in the two surveys
also may have contributed to the observed decline in prevalence.
Devices from the same manufacturer were used in both surveys,
but NHANES III used first-generation pencil-beam instruments
(QDR 1000), whereas NHANES 2005­2006 used third-generation
fan-beam instruments (QDR 4500a/Discovery). The DXA manu-
facturer performed calibration studies between sequential
generations of DXA instruments so that the old and new
systems would provide equivalent BMD values within the
average accepted level of agreement between any two DXA
systems of roughly Æ 2%. However, a direct in vivo comparison
between the QDR 1000 and QDR 4500a/Discovery was not made
(Thomas Kelly, personal communication, Hologic, Inc.). We found
only a small number of published studies with in vivo results for
the QDR 1000 compared directly with any version of the QDR
4500a,(18­21) and they differed somewhat in the estimated
magnitude and direction of the BMD difference for a particular
femur region of interest. Some studies found that the difference
between DXA systems depended on the subject's BMD value,(18)
whereas others did not.(20,21) This lack of consistency prevented
us from developing a robust statistical adjustment to remove the
effects of the DXA system change from the NHANES data set.
Instead, we performed a sensitivity analysis in which we raised or
lowered each NHANES 2005­2006 respondent's BMD value by
3% and reexamined differences in prevalence between NHANES
2005­2006 and NHANES III. Conclusions were unchanged for
women regardless of how BMD was adjusted and changed
for men only when BMD values were adjusted by ­3%. This
suggests, but cannot establish, that differences in DXA techn-
ology are unlikely to fully explain the apparent decline seen
between surveys, at least in women. Interpretation of the change
in prevalence among men is complicated by the low prevalence
estimates observed in both surveys.
Race/ethnic differences in femur BMD were similar to those
seen in NHANES III,(24) with non-Hispanic blacks having the
highest BMD values and non-Hispanic whites having the lowest
values. Mexican Americans had BMD values that generally fell
between those of non-Hispanic blacks and whites, although not
all the differences were statistically different. Interestingly,
Mexican Americans had lower BMD values than non-Hispanic
whites for the total body and at several large skeletal subregions
when total-body BMD values from NHANES 1999­2004 were
examined.(4) The use of different population samples in NHANES
1999­2004 versus 2005­2006 could have contributed to this
discrepancy, but a similar discrepancy in ranking of Hispanics
versus whites also has been observed in other studies in which
both the femur and total-body measurements were made on the
same individuals.(25,26) The basis for this discrepancy is unclear.
Differences in femur shape between ethnic groups could be a
contributing factor. For example, differences in anteroposterior
diameter and platymeria, or flattening, of the proximal femur
have been noted between whites and Native Americans.(27)
Mexican Americans vary in their degree of Native American
ancestry, but Klimenditis et al.(28) found that self-identified
Mexican Americans in New Mexico had 39% Native American
genetic admixture.
This study has limitations beyond the inability to directly
address the difference in DXA methods used in the two surveys.
The sample from NHANES 2005­2006, although nationally
representative, is smaller than the sample from NHANES III
and was drawn from fewer locations in the United States, so
prevalence estimates from NHANES 2005­2006 may be less
stable than those from NHANES III. Nonresponse bias may be

present in the estimates from both surveys. Nonresponse bias
owing to refusal to participate in the physical examinations in
NHANES is reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor
included in the calculation of the sample weights for use with
examinee data. Approximately 11% and 24%, respectively, of the
NHANES III and NHANES 2005­2006 respondents age 50 years
and older who came to the examination centers lacked usable
proximal femur DXA data, and this nonresponse is not addressed
by the sample weight adjustments. However, results from a
detailed nonresponse bias analysis conducted by NCHS prior to
public release of the NHANES 2005­2006 femur data suggested
that additional adjustments for nonresponse (beyond those
performed in the construction of the original examination
weights) were not necessary. Finally, institutionalized people, an
important at-risk group for osteoporosis,(29) are excluded from
the NHANES sampling frame by design.
In summary, the prevalence of osteoporosis, as defined by low
femur BMD, appears to have declined among older adults in the
United States since the mid-1990s so that osteoporosis reduction
targets identified for the population in Healthy People 2010
have been met. The observed decrease in femoral osteoporosis
seen between 1988­1994 and 2005­2006 is encouraging, but
the number of older US adults with low femur BMDs remains
substantial, and annual costs associated with osteoporotic
fractures are projected to rise by almost 50%, from $17 billion to
$25 billion, between the years 2005 and 2025 owing to the aging
of the population.(30) Although it is reasonable to assume that
the decline in the prevalence of low femur BMD underlies the fall
in hip fracture incidence that has been reported in other
studies,(1,2) this could not be addressed directly in the present
study owing to a lack of incident fracture data for this sample and
thus requires further investigation. Finally, more research is
needed to identify factors that underlie the decline in low BMD,
which does not appear to be explained by the increase in
average BMI of the population or by the introduction of new
pharmaceutical treatments for osteoporosis prevention and
treatment.
