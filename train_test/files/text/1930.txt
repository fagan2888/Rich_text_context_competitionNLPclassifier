The Massachusetts Division of
Health Care Finance and Policy
estimated that only 2.7% of state
residents remained uninsured as
of spring 2009.2 National policy-
makers have turned to Massa-
chusetts as a potential model for
federal health care reform, and
reform proposals recently put for-
ward in Congress include elements
from the Massachusetts plan, such
as the individual mandate to buy
insurance, public-program expan-
sions, and a health insurance ex-
change.
Despite the state's low percent-
age of uninsured residents, na-
tional reviews of the Massachu-
setts reform have been mixed,
especially in recent months. Al-
though some reports have drawn
attention to the state's insurance
gains and indicated that health
care costs, though growing, have
not exceeded early projections or
expectations, others have argued
that high costs and some report-
ed problems with access to care
should be taken as warnings of
the problems the country might
face if a similar reform were im-
plemented nationally. For exam-
ple, Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute has called the Massa-
chusetts reform "unsustainable"
because of its "failure to restrain
the growth in health care costs"
and the fact that it has "set the
stage for . . . price controls and
explicit rationing."3 Similarly, a
June 24, 2009, post about the
Massachusetts reform on the blog
of John Boehner of Ohio, the Re-
publican leader in the U.S. House
of Representatives, said that "out
of control costs" and "rationing"
have been consequences of uni-
versal coverage in Massachusetts.
We know from previous re-
search that the Massachusetts
public is favorable toward the
state's legislation,4 but physicians
can provide critical insight into
how the law is actually function-
ing and how it has affected ac-
cess to high-quality health care.
In previous studies, Massachu-
setts physicians have been inter-
viewed about their experiences
with and impressions of other
reform issues, such as managed
care and a potential single-payer
health care system, but only one
poll to date has asked physicians
about Massachusetts health care
reform. That online poll, conduct-
ed by the American College of
Emergency Physicians, focused on
the views of 138 emergency doc-

In 2006, Massachusetts enacted the country's
first law mandating near-universal health care
coverage,1 and the state now has the lowest pro-
portion of uninsured residents in the United States.

tors. Its results suggest that re-
form in Massachusetts is putting
pressure on emergency room ca-
pacity.5 In a poll we conducted
with support from the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and
the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Mas-
sachusetts Foundation, we turned
to physicians in Massachusetts
more broadly to assess their per-
ceptions in three areas: their over-
all support for the legislation,
their views of its effect on their
own practice, and their views of
its effect on health care through-
out the state. (Methods are de-
scribed in the box.)
Of 2135 practicing Massachu-
setts physicians who responded
to the poll, 70% said they sup-
port the Massachusetts Health
Care Reform Law, whereas 13%
oppose it (see Table 1). The lev-
els of support among primary
care doctors and among special-
ists were similar. When asked
about the law's future, 75% in-
dicated that they want the law
to remain in place -- 46% with
some changes, and 29% as is.

Poll Methods
Study Design and Fielding
The poll was designed and analyzed by a team of researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health. The fielding process was coordinated
by an independent survey research firm, Social Science Research Solutions.
Sources of Data
The data are from a randomized poll of 2135 Massachusetts physicians. Researchers obtained a random sample of physicians practicing in
Massachusetts from the SK&A database, which is a comprehensive list of physicians based on published association and trade directo-
ries as well as federal and state license files. Information in the directory is updated and verified every 6 months.
Physicians were invited to participate in the study by means of a mailed letter and were offered an incentive ranging from $50 to $100 for
completing the poll. The incentive amount was determined by the physician's specialty, as is standard practice in polls of physicians. All
respondents were offered the opportunity to complete the poll by mail, Internet, or telephone; all chose mail or Internet.
Poll Questions
A complete list of questions asked as part of the poll is available in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at
NEJM.org.
Data Collection and Statistical Analysis
The poll was conducted from August 11 to September 15, 2009. This period was chosen to help ensure the relevance of the data to the na-
tional debate on health care reform. Congress had originally been expected to vote on a health care reform bill in October 2009. The peri-
od was short to ensure that we captured views during a relatively uniform period that was less likely than a longer period to be interrupt-
ed by changes in the environment, such as media reports on the issue, that might affect physicians' views differentially over time. We is-
sued a higher number of initial mailings and predicted a lower response rate than in longer-term surveys, and we used weighting tech-
niques to ensure that the final responses reflect the views of the overall physician population. This approach is similar to standard tech-
niques for polls of the public. It has been shown to be more accurate than surveys of the public with longer field times for issues that are
sensitive to changes in media coverage, such as election campaigns. Independent studies have shown that statistically weighting the
data for known population variables reduces the effects of a lower response rate.1,2
More physicians wanted to participate in the poll than we had expected, so we allowed those who wanted to complete the poll after the
deadline to submit their responses with the understanding that they would not be provided with an incentive. We compared the demo-
graphic profiles of those who responded within the window when incentives were offered to the profiles of the full sample and to the pro-
files of all physicians in Massachusetts. We found few differences in either comparison, although both of our samples include a smaller
fraction of medical subspecialists than the population of Massachusetts physicians does. We also compared responses to a key substan-
tive question (whether the respondent supports or opposes the legislation) between our two samples and did not find a significant dif-
ference in the level of support for the legislation.
To ensure that we used a representative sample, our analysis weighted the final sample to reflect the composition of Massachusetts physi-
cians. Characteristics included in the weighting were specialty, regional location, and setting of practice (urban, suburban, or rural).
When interpreting our findings, it is important to recognize that all polls are subject to sampling error, and results may differ from what
might have been found if all physicians in Massachusetts had been polled. The sampling error for this poll is ±1.9 percentage points.
Possible sources of nonsampling error also include nonresponse bias and effects of the wording and ordering of the questions. As calcu-
lated with the use of a standard of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the response rate was 28%.
In comparing responses among subgroups of physicians, we used t-tests that accounted for the weighting of the data. All reported P values
are based on two-sided tests.

Seven percent favored repealing
the legislation. Physicians who
mentioned that some changes are
needed were asked in an open-
ended question what change they
would most like to see. They most
frequently mentioned issues re-
lated to expanding coverage (34%)
and addressing the costs of the
program (23%). Approximately
three quarters of Massachusetts
physicians (79%) reported being
very or somewhat satisfied with
their medical practice. Fifty per-
cent reported that things at their
practice had gotten worse over the
past 3 years, and 23% said things
had gotten better. Few said that
the Massachusetts health care re-
form law was a major reason for
positive changes (13%) or negative
ones (11%).
We also asked physicians
about 22 aspects of their prac-
tices that might be affected by
the law. Table 2 shows the re-
sponses in descending order of
the number of negative respons-
es. In 21 of these areas, a major-
ity of physicians said that the law
either did not have much of an
effect or was having a positive
effect on their practice. These
include areas that have been im-
portant in the health care reform
debate: the quality of care their
patients receive (85%), their med-
ical practice overall (79%), the
amount of time their patients
wait to get an appointment (62%),
and the financial situation of
their practice as a whole (56%).
Forty-eight percent of physicians
said that the law was decreasing
the number of patients in their
practice who were uninsured,
which was the highest percent-
age of positive responses regard-
ing any practice area. Forty-two
percent reported that it was pos-
itively affecting their uninsured
patients' ability to pay for care.
The aspect that elicited the most
negative response was the law's

administrative burden on their
practice; 35% of physicians said
the law was negatively affecting
this area. About one quarter of
physicians reported negative ef-
fects in the overall cost of care
for patients, their financial situ-
ation, and the amount of time pa-
tients wait for an appointment.
As for the broader effects on
the state, 3 years after implemen-
tation of the law, Massachusetts
physicians rate the state's health
care system positively. Nearly twice
as many physicians rate the Mas-
sachusetts system for providing
medical care as excellent or good
as rate the national system that
highly (63% vs. 33%) (see Table 3).
In this section of the poll, we
also asked physicians to assess
the impact of the law on health
care in the state as a whole. We
queried them about 10 aspects
of health care in Massachusetts
that might be affected by the law.
Table 3 shows the responses in
descending order of the number
of negative responses. In 9 of
these 10 aspects, a majority or
plurality said that the law either
did not have much of an effect
or was having a positive effect
on the situation in the state. For
example, more than three quar-
ters of physicians (79%) believed
the law was positively affecting
people who had not had health
insurance before the law went
into effect. The second most pos-
itively affected aspect was the
quality of care in Massachusetts
(with 37% reporting that the law
was helping). The one feature of
the law's impact that received
negative evaluations from a ma-
jority of physicians (53%) con-
cerned the overall cost of care in
the state. The next most negative-
ly affected aspect was patients'
ability to see a primary care pro-
vider (with 34% reporting that
the law was hurting that), although
nearly as many physicians re-
ported that the law was helping
in this area (29%). More than 25%
of physicians said they did not
know what effect the law was
having on each of five areas: the
overall cost of care in Massachu-
setts, the cost that Massachusetts
patients pay, primary care prac-
tices, hospitals, and specialty
practices.
Massachusetts has the lowest
proportion of uninsured residents
in the United States. Our results
show that there is widespread
support among Bay State physi-
cians for the law that led to this
high level of coverage. At the same
time, physicians believe that it has
contributed to some problems with
health care in the state.
Examination of physicians'
views on care for their patients
provides little evidence to sup-
port criticisms that the law is
negatively affecting the quality of
care that most physicians deliver.
With regard to their own prac-
tices, a sizable minority of physi-
cians indicate that the legislation
has increased their administrative
burden.
Physicians' views concerning
the effect of the law on the state's
health care environment are more
mixed. Most believe it is helping
the formerly uninsured, but that
positive view is coupled with a
majority belief that the program
is driving up the cost of health
care in the state. In addition, phy-
sicians are divided about whether
it has imposed pressures on the
state's primary care capacity.
Taken together, these findings
suggest that it is possible both
to provide near-universal coverage
of the population and to have a
system that most physicians be-
lieve improves care for the unin-
sured without undermining their
ability to provide care to their pa-
tients. At the same time, the Mas-
sachusetts experience provides evi-
dence of trade-offs in other areas
of the health care system, includ-
ing rising health care costs and,
for some patients, challenges in
obtaining access to primary care.
