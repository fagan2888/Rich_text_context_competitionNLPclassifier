Abstract
A Cornsweet edge creates the perception of a step in surface lightness between two adjacent
regions of identical mean luminance due to a gradient on both sides. We might imagine that in a
concatenated set of these gradients, the lightness steps would accumulate, but they do not.
However, a diamond pattern, with each diamond filled with an identical luminance gradient
does give a cumulative Cornsweet effect. Here, we offer an illumination explanation for why
the cumulative effect is visible in the diamonds but not in the basic ramp grating and we
demonstrate that when the diamonds drift, they produce a strong brightening effect (depending
on the direction of the motion) and a dimming aftereffect. These effects are consistent with the
local luminance gradients and not with the global lightness shift of the cumulative Cornsweet
effect.

Figure 1 shows that the concatenation of rectangles with identical luminance gradients
does not produce cumulative lightness steps whereas the concatenation of diamonds does
(Figure 2). We propose that the diamond shapes support a decomposition into a reflectance
step and an illumination gradient. Thus, Figure 3 starts with a set of spatially uniform
diamonds that increase in mean reflectance from left to right. Under an illuminant that

gets progressively darker, the combination of reflectance steps and illumination gradient can
give all the diamonds the same mean luminance with an identical luminance gradient within
each ­ the diamond stimulus.
We propose that the critical factor that generates the cumulative effect is the continuous
luminance change that occurs along each edge in the diamond pattern but not the ramp
grating. In this case, the luminance decreases on both sides of the edge, mimicking
(although not exactly) the changes that would happen to a fixed reflectance edge under an
illumination gradient (see also Figure 4). In contrast, in the ramp grating, the luminance step
is constant all along the edge, giving no additional weight to an illumination explanation.
Although both the ramp grating (Figure 1) and the diamonds (Figure 2) are equally
well modeled as the sum of stepped reflectances and an illumination gradient, there is less
evidence for the illumination gradient in the ramp grating, tipping the balance against the
decomposition.
Figure 2. Cumulative Cornsweet effect. Each individual diamond on the left appears to have fairly uniform
lightness which then increases from darker for the bottom diamonds to lighter for the upper ones
(Watanabe, Cavanagh, & Anstis, 1995). This global lightness shift is opposite in direction to the actual
luminance gradients within each diamond. In addition, the cumulative Cornsweet effect is more evident on
the left for the pointy diamonds than on the right for the squat diamonds.
Figure 1. Left: Cornsweet effect. When two rectangles, each with the same light to dark gradient, abut,
there appears to be a uniform lightness step from one to the other (Cornsweet, 1970). Right: Several of these
rectangles are concatenated to form a sawtooth luminance profile. Here, the lightness steps do not
accumulate beyond the first step.

The diamond stimulus also reveals the relative roles of the two luminance gradients ­ the
cumulative, global lightness change between diamonds and the opposite, local gradient within
each diamond, in producing motion-induced brightening effects.We have previously shown
that drifting ramp gratings produce strong brightening and darkening effects (Cavanagh &
Anstis, 1986) and that adaptation to such temporal brightness ramps produces dramatic
brightening aftereffects (Anstis, 1967, 1979; Anstis & Harris, 1987; Arnold & Anstis,
1993). We now show that the moving diamond patterns produce the same effect as the
moving ramp grating and give similar aftereffects (Movie 1). Since these effects are in the
same direction as those for the ramp stimulus that has no global gradient, we conclude that
the local luminance gradients in the diamonds drive the brightening effects even though the
gradient has been perceptually suppressed.
Figure 4. Left: A set of identical spiky bars each having the same luminance gradient also produces a
cumulative lightness increase as the mean luminance across the borders increases along the border, as it does
in the diamond pattern. Middle: As the angle of the spikes becomes shallower, the cumulative effect weakens.
Right: It disappears when the angles are flat as in a ramp grating in Figure 1.
Figure 3. The diamond stimulus can be seen as a combination of a set of diamonds with uniform reflectance
(left image), stepping up in reflectance from left to right, viewed under an illumination gradient that gets
darker from left to right (right image). The result, on the right, can be a set of identical diamonds with the
same mean luminance and the same internal gradients. The visual system then decomposes this into uniform
reflectances increasing from left to right seen under a gradient of illumination.

In conclusion, we suggest that the diamond stimulus and other equivalent stimuli
(Figure 4) produce cumulative Cornsweet effects because they strongly support an
illumination gradient interpretation. They do so because the luminance changes along the
edges make the paired gradients on both sides mimic the luminance difference across a fixed
reflectance edge under a luminance gradient. This holds even though the luminances in the
diamond stimulus differ by a constant amount rather than by a constant ratio as they should
for an illumination effect. In contrast, the edges in a ramp grating have one fixed luminance
difference along them and give simply one datum point in favour of an illumination gradient.
Finally, both motion-induced brightness effects were consistent with the direction of the
internal gradients of the diamonds despite the perceptual reduction of the gradient. This
shows that the actual luminance gradient generates the effect and that the perceived
lightness gradient does not contribute to motion-induced brightness effects.

Movie 1. Part 1: The two fields move in opposite directions. Every second, they reverse direction, and the
motion-induced brightening switches sides. Part 2: Here, when the motion reverses, the direction of the
gradients are also reversed to keep the lightening and darkening effects on the same side throughout. After
24 seconds of adaptation, the movie stops and the darkening and brightening aftereffects are visible in the
outlined regions.
