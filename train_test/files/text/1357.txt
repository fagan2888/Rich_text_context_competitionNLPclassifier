OBJECTIVE: To examine the agreement between individuals' weight status as measured by their body mass index (BMI) and
their perceptions of their weight status in the US population.
DESIGN: Data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988­94 (NHANES III), were used to cross-
tabulate actual weight status and self-assessed weight status, identifying population proportions that underassessed or
overassessed weight status. The study accounts for gender and socioeconomic and demographic variables to identify
subpopulations in which relatively large numbers of individuals misperceive their weight status.
MEASUREMENTS: Survey data included clinically measured height and weight. BMI was categorized (overweight, healthy
weight, or underweight) following conventional cutpoints. In addition, each surveyed individual was asked to assess their own
(categorical) weight status.
SUBJECTS: NHANES III is representative of the US population. The sample included 7758 males and 8451 females aged 20 y or
above after excluding women who were pregnant or breastfeeding.
RESULTS: We show that large segments of the US population misperceive their weight status. The mix of misperceptions
differs by gender, with men who are obese or overweight more likely than obese or overweight women to underassess their
weight status. Women who are healthy weight/underweight are more likely than men to believe they are overweight. In
addition to the gender differences, underassessors are more frequently found among those aged 65 y and over, individuals with
relatively low education levels, lower income levels, and among non-Hispanic black subjects. Overassessors are more frequently
found among women less than 65 y old (between the ages of 35 and 64 y for men), individuals with higher education levels,
higher income levels, and among non-Hispanic white subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: Information programs linking overweight and obesity with health risks might fail to induce diet and lifestyle
changes if individuals fail to recognize they are overweight or obese. While there are large number of individuals who fail to
recognize their overweight or obese status, there are indicator variables that can help identify this subpopulation. Thus, it is
possible to first target a message that would attempt to correct misperceptions. If successful, the size of the population
susceptible to a weight­health risk information program could increase.

Introduction
Although health authorities have expressed growing concern
over the high level of obesity in the US, most Americans are
not seriously concerned with obesity and express relatively
low support for policies to reduce obesity.1 The incongruence
between the views of the health authorities and the public is
a problem for obesity prevention efforts. One reason for the
relatively low level of public awareness of the obesity
epidemic may be that, while 64% of US adults are estimated
to be overweight or obese,2 only 22% consider their own
weight problem as serious.1
In this paper, we further explore this mismatch between
individuals' weight status based on criteria set by the health
authorities and their perceptions of their weight status. The
extent of misperception about weight status has important
implications for health information programs that might be
used to reduce the prevalence of obesity. For example, upon
receiving information about the connection between weight

status and health risks, a prudent individual might make diet
and lifestyle changes to lose weight, hoping to reduce the
health risks. However, health information programs might
fail to induce this type of behavior if overweight individuals
do not believe they are overweight. These individuals will
assume that the message is intended for someone else. In this
case, the people most in need of changing their diet and
lifestyle will not do so. An entirely different strategy would
be necessary to induce desired diet and lifestyle changes.
Currently, there is widespread agreement that body mass
index (BMI) offers a fairly reliable means of assessing an
individual's total body fat, as BMI is significantly correlated
with total body fat content.3 Also important is that BMI is
calculated from information that can be gathered easily
(height and weight). That simplicity along with the wide-
spread use of BMI within both the private sector and the
public health community suggests that it is easy for
individuals to assess correctly their weight status. However,
individuals may not develop self-perceptions of their weight
status solely based on criteria set by health authorities. Other
factors such as health risk perceptions, social norms, and
cultural and ethnic traditions may influence how individuals
assess their own obesity or overweight status. This may
create a mismatch between the public health community's
assessment of obesity prevalence and the public's own
assessment of overweight and obesity.
In this paper, we examine the agreement between
individuals' weight status as indicated by their BMI, and
their perceptions of their weight status. Using data from the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
1988­1994 (NHANES III),4 we show that large segments of
the population misperceive their weight status and that the
pattern of misperceptions differs by gender and system-
atically follows socioeconomic and demographic lines.
Methods
NHANES III is a nationally representative survey. Most
surveyed individuals went through an extensive health
evaluation at a Mobile Examination Center (MEC). As part
of the evaluation, technicians measured individual weight
and height. We used weight and height measurements to
calculate BMI and classified adults as obese (BMIZ30 kg/m2),
overweight (25 kg/m2rBMIo30 kg/m2), or healthy weight/
underweight (BMIo25 kg/m2). In addition to physical
measurements, adults also answered a health questionnaire
during the evaluation. They were asked to assess their own
weight status: `Do you consider yourself now to be over-
weight, underweight, or about the right weight?' We cross-
tabulate the BMI-based weight classification against indivi-
duals' own self-assessed weight status, namely whether
individuals believe they are overweight or fall into the
combined category of `about the right weight' or under-
weight. We assume that individuals interpret `about the right
weight' to mean healthy weight. We limit our attention to
three BMI-based weight classes (obese, overweight, and
healthy weight/underweight), two self-assessed weight
classes (overweight and healthy weight/underweight), and
the six cross-classifications.
Based on this cross-tabulation, we identify two types of
misperceptions: underassessment and overassessment of
weight status. Underassessment is defined here as occurring
when individuals are obese or overweight but believe they
are healthy weight or underweight. Overassessment occurs
when individuals are healthy weight or underweight, but
believe they are overweight. There are three cross-classifica-
tions for which individual self-assessments are accurate.
These include the obese and the overweight who believe
they are overweight, and the healthy weight/underweight
who believe they are healthy weight/underweight.
Our attention is especially focused on the size of the
overweight and obese groups that underassess their weight
status. Our work shares some similarity to that of Paeratakul
et al,5 in that they tabulate subpopulation percentages of
individuals who believe they are overweight. From their
statistics, one can calculate percentages that underassess
their weight status. However, their analysis is based on self-
reported height and weight data (from the US Department of
Agriculture's Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Indivi-
duals). Self-reported height and weight data are unlikely to
be as precise as clinically measured data used in this study,
and may be systematically biased.6 Further, our subpopula-
tion definitions are finer than theirs, showing more precisely
where the misperceptions are concentrated. We also examine
the size of the group that overassesses its weight status. This
is important since there are two ways health information
programs may fail to yield desired diet and lifestyle changes.
While information might fail to generate health concerns
among the overweight and obese, information conceivably
could also unnecessarily generate health concerns among
those who are not overweight.
To highlight where misperceptions are concentrated, we
cross-tabulated weight status and perceived weight status
separately by gender and by socioeconomic and demo-
graphic variables. These cross-tabulations help to identify
the proportion of underassessors and overassessors in
different subpopulations. Contrast t-tests revealed whether
gender and differences in socioeconomic and demographic
variables are related to the accuracy of weight status beliefs.
We looked for differences in the frequencies of weight
misperceptions between those who did not complete high
school and those who attained higher education levels;
between those below the poverty threshold and those in
higher income classes; between non-Hispanic white subjects
and other broad race/ethnicity classes; and between indivi-
duals aged 20­34 y and older age cohorts.
In addition to gender and socioeconomic and demo-
graphic variables, we examined the association between
weight assessment accuracy with smoking behavior, Food
Stamp use, and food security. Smoking is known to influence
adiposity and weight.7 Its impact on weight assessment

accuracy has not been investigated. Studies of smokers' risk
perceptions have shown that, on an average, smokers
significantly overassess health risks of smoking. However,
nonsmokers generally overassess risks of smoking to a greater
extent.8 If smokers consistently make more informed risk
assessments than nonsmokers, we should see more over-
assessors among healthy weight/underweight nonsmokers
than among healthy weight/underweight smokers.
Food Stamps have been hypothesized to influence weight
status by raising energy intake.9 Receipt of Food Stamps
could have a variety of effects on weight status assessment
accuracy as some Food Stamp users would be undernour-
ished and underweight without Food Stamps while others
are badly nourished but not underweight. We examined the
relation between weight assessment accuracy and food
security because Food Stamps are intended to increase food
security.
We excluded from calculation women who were pregnant
or breastfeeding, limiting the analysis to adults age 20 y or
more. A small fraction of individuals did not report self-
assessed weight status. After these exclusions, the available
sample included 7758 male and 8451 female subjects.
Available sample sizes were slightly smaller for some cross-
tabulations because of missing values for the relevant
socioeconomic variables.
NHANES III was based upon a complex sample design. The
survey drew a multistage, stratified, clustered sample, and
represents the total civilian noninstitutionalized population,
2 months of age or over, in the 50 states of the United States.
Our estimates of population proportions incorporated
sample weights to account for unequal probabilities of
selection. The variances of statistics reflected design effects,
accounting for strata and primary sampling units. We used a
software package, `SUDAAN-Software for the Statistical
Analysis of Correlated Data',10 so our contrast statistics
would accurately reflect the sampling variance.
Results
We found that misperceiving weight status is commonplace.
Tabulating the number of individuals by weight status shows
that 59.00% of male subjects are either overweight or obese
(BMIZ25 kg/m2). Tabulating male subjects by self-assessed
weight status shows that 44.22% say they are overweight.
The relative magnitudes are opposite for female subjects. For
female subjects, 50.49% are either overweight or obese, while
60.09% say they are overweight. In effect, the mix of
misperceptions among men is different from that among
women.
Table 1 reports results of cross-tabulating actual and
perceived weight status, with separate cross-tabulations for
male and for female subjects. The table shows the percen-
tages of men and women of varying weight statuses that
believe that they are healthy weight/underweight. For the
obese and overweight, the table indicates the percentages of
each weight class that are mistaken, underassessing their
weight. Clearly, the number of mistakes is substantial. For
the healthy weight/underweight, the table indicates the
percentages that are correct, here defined as accurately
identifying themselves as healthy weight/underweight.
The table shows that the mistakes are not all at the margin,
where an individual who weighs a few pounds over the
overweight cutpoint might say his weight is about right.
Instead, many of the mistakes are much larger. Among male
subjects who are overweight, but not obese, 42.74% do not
perceive that they are overweight. Instead, they say their
weight is about right or that they are underweight. The error
rate for this type of mistake is lower among obese males, with
11.90% saying their weight is about right or that they are
underweight. So, being a little above the cutpoint for
overweight makes a person more likely to say their weight
is about right compared to a person who is obese. However, a
nontrivial number of individuals whose BMI values are
30 kg/m2 or more describe themselves as if their BMI values
were less than 25 kg/m2.
These cross-tabulations show that gender differences are
substantial. Women who are obese or overweight are more
likely than men to assess accurately their weight status,
acknowledging they are overweight. For example, 18.40% of
women who are overweight, but not obese, say they are
healthy weight/underweight and 72.60% (100.00­18.40) say
they are overweight. That is, men who are overweight are
more than twice as likely as women who are overweight to
fail to recognize their overweight status. In contrast, women
are more likely to believe they are overweight when they are
not overweight. For men, 10.96% of those who are healthy
weight/underweight believe they are overweight (100.00­
89.04 ¼ 10.96). Among women who are healthy weight/
underweight, 35.32% believe they are overweight. This
accords with Sciacca et al's finding that more women (40%)
considered themselves overweight compared with men
(24%).11
Table 2 shows results of cross-tabulating weight status and
self-assessed weight status separately by levels of four socio-
economic and demographic variables. As results for men and
women differ so strikingly, we further refine the sub-
populations, differentiating by gender. Under columns
headed `obese' or `overweight', the table shows the propor-
tion of underassessors among the obese and overweight,
separated by education, income, race/ethnicity, and age,

with each socioeconomic and demographic variable further
differentiated by gender. Numbers listed under `obese' are
proportions of obese subpopulations who say they are
healthy weight/underweightFthe very optimistic. Similarly,
numbers listed under `overweight' are proportions of over-
weight subpopulations who say they are healthy weight/
underweightFalso optimistic, but not so much as the obese
who claim to be healthy weight/underweight. For example,
7.90% of male college graduates who are obese claim to be
healthy weight/underweight.
Under the columns headed `healthy/underweight', the
table also shows the proportion of overassessors among the
healthy weight/underweight similarly separated by four
socioeconomic and demographic variables and further
differentiated by gender. For example, 34.83% of healthy
weight/underweight female college graduates say they are
overweight.
Base levels for comparison are education of grade 11 or
less, household income at or below 130% of the poverty
level, non-Hispanic white subjects, and age of more
than 64 y, each estimated separately for male and for
female subjects. We reported statistical significance of
differences from base levels using * to denote an a ¼ 0.10
level of significance, ** to denote a ¼ 0.05, and *** to denote
a ¼ 0.01.
Education
We separated the population by educational attainment,
denoting those with 16 or 17 y of education as `college'. and
those with 13, 14, or 15 y of education, we denoted `some
college'. We assumed that 12 y of education implies high
school completion and that 11 y or fewer did not. As some
respondents did not report the highest grade they com-
pleted, the cross-tabulations included data from 7697 males
and 8403 females.
Underassessment falls as education levels reach or exceed
high school. Among both the obese and the overweight
(those who can underassess), the proportion of under-
assessors is larger among those who did not complete high
school than among those with greater education levels. This
association is realized for male and for female subjects. In
fact, for each level of education at or above high school, the
percentage of underassessors is significantly smaller than in
corresponding base levels of nonhigh school graduates (at
least at the a ¼ 0.10 level). For example, among overweight

underassessed their weight status, while 14.48% of over-
weight women who did complete high school underassessed.
Among overweight women who completed some college,
11.25% underassessed and 9.51% of overweight women
college graduates underassessed.
However, while education is associated with a lower error
rate among the obese and overweight, education is asso-
ciated with a higher error rate among the healthy weight/
underweight. The proportion of overassessors is smaller
among the healthy weight/underweight who did not
complete high school than among those with more years
of education. These differences are statistically significant for
both males and females.
Income
We segmented the population based on family income
relative to the poverty threshold. We established three
income classes: those with family income at or below
130% of the poverty threshold, those with greater family
income but not more than 350% of the poverty threshold,
and those with family income above 350% of the poverty
threshold. Poverty threshold was defined by the age of the
family reference person, and the calendar year in which the
family was interviewed. Poverty threshold values (in dollars)
are produced annually by the US Census Bureau (Series P-60).
These threshold values are based on calendar years and
adjusted for changes caused by inflation between calendar
years. As some survey respondents refused to discuss their
income, cross-tabulations included data from 7070 male and
7626 female subjects.
In general, findings related to income are similar to those
for education. For obese and overweight female subjects in
higher income classes, there were fewer underassessors than
in the lowest income class. There were significantly more
overassessors among the healthy weight/underweight in
higher income classes. Results for male subjects were
approximately the same, with one exception. The propor-
tions of underassessors among the obese in higher income
classes appear to be smaller than in the lowest income class,
but the differences are not statistically significant.
Race and ethnicity
We separated individuals by race and ethnicity, creating four
mutually exclusive categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic white (base), and non-Hispanic other people
(Aleuts, Eskimos, American Indians, Asians, and Pacific
Islanders). In the survey results, each sampled individual
provided complete information on race, ethnicity, and age.
Thus, cross-tabulations included data from 7758 male and
8451 female subjects both for race/ethnicity and for age.
For both male and female non-Hispanic black subjects,
there were more underassessors among the overweight and
obese, compared to non-Hispanic white subjects. Also, there
were fewer overassessors among the healthy weight/under-
weight non-Hispanic black subjects. Hispanics were qualita-
tively similar to non-Hispanic black subjects. Hispanics and
non-Hispanic black subjects displayed the same pattern of
differences from non-Hispanic white subjects. Statistical
significance of the differences between Hispanic and non-
Hispanic white subjects was not as high, however, as the
difference between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic
white subjects.
Age
Based on respondent's age at the MEC exam, we classified
each into one of five age cohorts: 20­34, 35­44, 45­54, 55­
64, and 65 y or more. Male and female subjects are alike in
that the number of underassessors among the overweight
and obese is larger in the oldest cohort. The number of
overassessors is smallest among the oldest cohort.
Smoking, food stamps, and food security
Results of these cross-tabulations are presented in Table 3.
Contrasts are indicated by comparing proportions on one
row with matching categories on the row below (base).
Cross-tabulations included data from 4256 smokers and
11 952 nonsmokers. The percentage of overassessors among
the healthy weight/underweight is lower for smokers than
for nonsmokers. That is, healthy weight/underweight smo-
kers are somewhat better at assessing their own weight status
than are nonsmokers. Assessing weight status is clearly not
the same as assessing health risks from being overweight, but

does suggest that healthy weight/underweight smokers are
better informed than healthy weight/underweight nonsmo-
kers about their own weight status. Overweight and obese
smokers demonstrate no such advantage over overweight
and obese nonsmokers. There is no statistical difference
between obese smokers and obese nonsmokers in weight
assessment accuracy. Nor is there a difference between
overweight smokers and overweight nonsmokers.
The survey asked, `Did (you/any member of this family)
receive food stamps in any of the last 12 months?' Food
stamps refers to the Food Stamp Program administered by
the US Department of Agriculture. The cross-tabulations
included data from 2428 Food Stamp recipients and 13 743
nonrecipients. Differentiating on the basis of Food Stamp
receipt yielded mixed results regarding weight assessment
accuracy. There are a higher percentage of underassessors
among overweight Food Stamp recipients than among
nonrecipients. However, there are fewer healthy weight/
underweight overassessors among Food Stamp recipients
than among nonrecipients. These results mirror findings for
income and education. It is not possible to attribute causality
to any one of these factors.
The survey asked respondents `Do you have enough food
to eat, sometimes not enough to eat, or often not enough to
eat?' The intent of this question was to capture insufficient
food availability at the family level because of lack of money
and/or other resources. Cross-tabulations included 15 200
food secure responses and 989 insecure. Results are similar to
those for Food Stamps, although statistical significance is
lower.
Discussion
In cross-tabulating weight status, calculated from measured
height and weight, with perceived weight status, we found
that misperceptions are commonplace. Nearly 43% of over-
weight (but not obese) men believe their weight is about
right. Nearly 12% of obese men say their weight is about
right. Underassessments are in the range of two to three
times more common among men than among women.
These findings are important for the design of information
programs. An information program could be designed to
induce diet and lifestyle changes among the overweight and
obese by demonstrating associations between weight status
and health risks from chronic diseases. It is likely that
underassessors would ignore such a program. In effect, over
one-third of men to whom such a program would be targeted
would fail to recognize the program's importance.
Our definition of misperceptions included both under-
assessing and overassessing weight statuses. More than one-
third of healthy weight or underweight women say they are
overweight. This should be of concern for information
programs designed to raise the awareness of the health risks
of being overweight. Raising awareness could be harmful to
overassessors by unnecessarily generating health concerns.
As Sciacca et al11 note, perception of overweight has been
linked to harmful eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa
and bulimia, which afflict American women.
We found that many factors beyond gender characterize
the subpopulation that misperceives weight status. Under-
assessors are more frequently found among those aged 65 y
and over, individuals with relatively low education levels,
lower income levels, and among non-Hispanic black sub-
jects. Overassessors are more frequently found among
women less than 65 y old (between the ages of 35 and 64 y
for men), individuals with higher education levels, higher
income levels, and among non-Hispanic white subjects.
Thus, it is possible to first target a message that would
attempt to correct misperceptions. If successful, the size of
the population susceptible to a weight­health risk program
would significantly increase.
