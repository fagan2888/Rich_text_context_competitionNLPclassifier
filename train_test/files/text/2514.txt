SUMMARY
Both night-time sleep and nap behaviour have been linked consistently to
health outcomes. Although reasons for napping are usually tied to night-
time sleep, the majority of studies assess their effects independently.
The current study thus aimed to examine the health relevance of patterns
of sleep behaviour that take into account both night-time and daytime
sleep habits. Night-time sleep, recorded during 7 days via actigraphy
from 313 participants (aged 34­82 years) of the Midlife in the United
States II Biomarker study, was assessed. Blood and urine specimens
were assayed for noradrenaline, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein.
Participants self-reported nap behaviour, depressive symptoms, per-
ceived chronic stress and the presence of medical symptoms and
conditions. Overall, nappers (n = 208) showed elevated waist­hip ratios,
C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels compared to non-nappers and
reported more physiological symptoms and conditions (all P  0.019).
Within nappers, cluster analysis revealed three patterns of sleep
behaviour--infrequent nappers with good night-time sleep, frequent
nappers with good night-time sleep and nappers with poor night-time
sleep. Nappers with poor night-time sleep thereby exhibited elevated
noradrenaline levels, depressive symptoms and perceived stress scores
compared to other groups (all P  0.041). These findings support the
idea that nap­health relationships are complex, in that frequency of
napping and accumulation of nap sleep is not related linearly to health
consequences. Assessing nap behaviour in conjunction with night-time
sleep behaviour appeared crucial to elucidate further the health
relevance of napping, particularly in terms of psychological health
outcomes, including chronic stress and depressive symptoms.
INTRODUCTION
Sleep is crucial for maintaining both physical and mental
health. Consequently, sleep problems and short sleep have
been linked to depression (Goldstein and Walker, 2014;
Luyster et al., 2012), as well as cardiovascular morbidity,
hypertension and obesity (Magee et al., 2008; Mullington
et al., 2009). Furthermore, sleep-restricted individuals show
elevated inflammatory processes, as indicated by elevated
interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels (Ferrie
et al., 2013; Haack et al., 2007; Van Leeuwen et al., 2009).
However, more sleep does not necessarily equal better
overall health. In fact, oversleeping has been shown to have
negative physical and psychological health implications as
well (Jennum et al., 2014; Prather et al., 2015). These
findings emphasize the importance of maintaining a delicate
balance in order to reap the full health benefits of sleep.
Importantly, this does not apply only to night-time sleep, but
to sleep occurring at any time during a 24-h period (Evans
and Rogers, 1994; Torsvall et al., 1989).
In addition to sleeping at night, approximately 50% of
Americans report sleeping during the day (National Sleep
Foundation, 2013). Although such a frequent behaviour, its
health consequences are not well understood. Naps have
been shown to improve cognitive performance, reduce
subjective sleepiness and improve mood in healthy subjects
and, furthermore, to restore IL-6 levels following sleep
deprivation (Faraut et al., 2011; Luo and Inoue, 2000; Milner
and Cote, 2009; Vgontzas et al., 2007). However, in midlife
adults, napping is associated with higher body mass index

J Sleep Res. (2016) 25, 225­233 Nap and night-time sleep
(BMI) and central adiposity (Owens et al., 2010), and in older
adults, frequent napping is associated with depressive
symptoms, an increased risk for type 2 diabetes, and excess
weight (Foley et al., 2007; Hays et al., 1996; Xu et al., 2010).
Notably, variation in nap duration and frequency as well as
methodological issues can complicate the determination of
health consequences. For example, while laboratory studies
can manipulate circumstances to address how napping
contributes to health outcomes, they may not be generaliz-
able to natural sleep behaviour. Conversely, observational
sleep studies provide insight into naturally occurring sleep
behaviour, but often exclude nap information, use incidence
of napping as a classifier only or focus upon how previous
sleep affects subsequent napping, and vice versa. While
these approaches are paramount to understanding the
interplay between sleep and health, napping is treated as a
behaviour distinct from night-time sleep. However, quantity
and quality of night-time sleep may influence reasons for
napping and thereby affect its links to health outcomes
differentially. For example, naps taken to compensate for
poor night-time sleep may differ in their health consequences
from naps taken for enjoyment. This raises the question of to
what extent napping behaviour must be considered in
conjunction with night-time sleep behaviour in order to
understand sleep­health relationships fully.
To address this question, the current study aimed to
assess relationships between health and naturally occurring
sleep behaviour patterns by conceptualizing (i) napping as
sleep behaviour occurring in conjunction with night-time
sleep and (ii) health as chronic health conditions, opera-
tionalized as chronic psychological health outcomes (e.g.
depressive symptoms), physiological health mediators (e.g.
inflammatory marker IL-6) and physiological health outcomes
(e.g. total number of symptoms and conditions reported). To
relate current findings to the recent literature, health effects of
napping were determined by comparing napping and non-
napping individuals. To address the main aim of the study,
interindividual differences in patterns of daytime and night-
time sleep combinations within napping individuals were
related to the same above-mentioned health outcomes.
The data utilized came from the Midlife in the United States
II (MIDUS II) Biomarker study. Participants provided 7 days'
worth of sleep and nap information, psychological health
questionnaires and blood samples for biomarker analysis.
This data set allows capturing an individual's sleep habits by
assessing actual sleep behaviour during the course of a
week by actigraphy (night-time sleep) and diary (napping) as
well as assessing a wide range of physiological and
psychological health issues.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants
Participants in this study were a subset of 368 healthy adults
who took part in the MIDUS II Biomarker study as well as the
follow-up actigraphy sleep study at the University of Wiscon-
sin, Madison (Ryff et al., 2013). Participants were excluded
from analysis for having incomplete data (n = 23), abnor-
mally high waist­hip ratios (n = 2; > 4 standard deviations
(SD) above the mean), abnormally high overnight urinary
noradrenaline secretion [n = 1; 8 standard deviations (SD)
above the mean], disordered sleep behaviour (n = 1; total
nap time 7 SD above the mean) and acute infection, i.e. IL-
6 > 10.0 pg/ml (n = 7) or CRP > 10.0 lg mLÀ1 (n = 22)
(e.g. Clyne and Olshaker, 1999). In total, 313 participants
met the above requirements and were included in analyses.
Participants were divided further into two groups--those who
reported napping at least once (n = 208) and those who did
not report napping (n = 105) during the study period. The
study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the University of Wisconsin­Madison, and informed
written consent was obtained for all participant.
Protocol
Participants were recruited from the MIDUS II Biomarker
Project study population. Upon arrival at the University of
Wisconsin, participants underwent a physical examination
and a medical history interview with a clinician and completed
a set of self-report questionnaires assessing demographic,
psychological and medical variables before an overnight
stay. During this stay, 12-h overnight urinary samples were
collected. Fasting blood samples were obtained the next
morning between 06:30 and 07:00 hours. Participants then
received detailed instructions on the at-home data collection
portion, including self-reported sleep assessments and an
Actiwatch to be worn around the wrist for seven consecutive
days and nights (see Dienberg Love et al. (2010) for more
details).
Measures
Actigraphy
Sleep behaviour data were collected using actigraphs (Acti-
watchâ-64; Mini Mitter, Bend, OR, USA, now Philips
Respironics). Respondents began recording at 07:00 hours
on the first Tuesday morning after their overnight stay and
continued for seven consecutive nights, indicating when they
started trying to fall asleep (bedtime) and when they arose in
the morning (rise time) by pressing the event marker button
on the Actiwatch. Upon return of the Actiwatches to MIDUS
project staff, event marker and sleep diary information
assisted automatic detection of sleep intervals by manufac-
turer algorithms (Actiware 5, Philips Respironics) (Ancoli-
Israel et al., 2003). Anomalous or incomplete actigraphy
intervals were reviewed further by study staff and hand-
scored or deleted as appropriate. Average sleep duration,
efficiency and latency were determined by averaging respec-
tive values from each of the seven study nights for each
participant.

Nap reporting
Napping was assessed by the MIDUS Biomarker Project
Daily Sleep Diary, a daily sleep diary, which was completed
at bedtime on each of the seven study days. Participants
reported whether napping occurred on any given day and, if
so, listed the nap(s) duration. No participants reported
multiple naps at any given day; thus, nap frequency is
equivalent to number of days a participant reported a nap.
Naps of a self-reported duration of 1 min or more were
considered for analyses. Total nap time was determined by
summing the duration of each nap occurring during the study
week to provide a cumulative measure of weekly napping.
Biomarkers/health mediators
Noradrenaline (NE) and cortisol levels were assessed in one
overnight 12-h urine sample collected during the in-laboratory
overnight stay. NE concentrations were determined by high-
pressure liquid chromatography, while urinary free cortisol and
d(3)-cortisol levels were measured by enzymatic colorimetric
assay and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
using multiple reaction monitoring in positive mode (Taylor
et al., 2002). All cortisol values reported as <0.019 lg dayÀ1
were adjusted to 0.019 lg dLÀ1. A cholesterol panel and the
inflammatory markers CRP and IL-6 were assessed in fasting
blood samples taken between 06:30 and 07:00 hours follow-
ing the in-laboratory overnight stay. Serum and plasma was
isolated from the respective samples, aliquoted, frozen at
À80°C, shipped on dry ice to the MIDUS Biocore Laboratory
and stored at À80°C until assayed. IL-6 was measured using
the Quantikineâ high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosor-
bent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
and CRP was measured using the BNII nephelometer from
Dade Behring (Deerfield, IL, USA) utilizing a particle-
enhanced immunonepholometric assay. CRP values
<0.15 lg dLÀ1 were adjusted to 0.14 lg dLÀ1. To determine
the ratio between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL)
and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), first HDL
cholesterol was determined using a lipid assay (Roche
Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA). HDL values >120
mg dLÀ1 were adjusted to 121 mg dLÀ1. Next, an estimation
of LDL-cholesterol level was made using the Fridewald formula
from direct measurements of total cholesterol, triglycerides
and HDL cholesterol (Ryff et al., 2013). Lastly, a HDL/LDL
ratio was computed by dividing HDL values with LDL values.
Waist­hip ratio was measured by study clinicians using a
Gulik II tape measure during the participants' visits to UW-
Madison. Abdominal obesity is commonly defined by a waist­
hip ratio above 0.90 for males and above 0.85 for females
(World Health Organization, 2011).
Self-report measures
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD)
scale was utilized to measure depressive symptoms (Radloff,
1977). The CESD is a well-validated and reliable (a = 0.89)
instrument composed of 20 items assessing the frequency of
depression-related symptoms during the last month. For the
purposes of the current study, CESD items related directly to
sleep were excluded from the total score in order to avoid
CESD sleep items driving associations between sleep and
depressive symptoms.
The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a widely used reliable
(a = 0.86) 10-item self-report questionnaire measuring
chronic stress. The questions are general in nature and
avoid content specific to subpopulations (Cohen et al., 1983).
Responses assess frequency of feelings of stress during the
last month, with a higher PSS score indicating higher
perceived chronic stress.
The `Symptoms and Conditions' category of the MIDUS
Biomarker Project Medical History questionnaire was utilized
to assess participants' health status. The total number of
symptoms and conditions per participant was calculated by
summing the presence of physician-confirmed self-report of
symptoms and conditions.
Statistical analyses
A three-step approach was used to address the study aims.
All analyses controlled for age, gender and race. First,
nappers were compared to non-nappers with regard to
demographics and sleep parameters using chi-squared tests
or analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Hierarchical regression
analyses were computed to test associations between
napping behaviour and health outcomes as well as to explore
the potential mediating effects of average night-time sleep
duration on these associations. To capture the complexity of
sleep behaviour, while at the same time avoiding computing
multiple sets of regressions, a two-step cluster analysis was
chosen to address the second aim of the study (King, 1967).
The cluster analysis combined self-report nap variables (nap
frequency, total nap time) as well as actigraphy-determined
night-time sleep variables (average sleep duration, average
sleep efficiency, sleep latency). Schwarz's Bayesian infor-
mation criterion (BIC) was used for establishing the optimal
number of clusters and analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the
classification relevance of variables. Clusters were tested for
associations with health-relevant outcome variables using
ANCOVAs. All analyses were computed in SPSS version 22.0.
Statistical significance was assumed at P  0.05.
RESULTS
Nappers versus non-nappers
Nappers and non-nappers were compared on all study
variables. Results are summarized in Table 1 and show no
differences in terms of gender, race, marital status or age (all
P > 0.23). While nappers were more likely to be unemployed
compared to non-nappers (P = 0.019), no differences were
observed with regard to level of education (v2 = 7.86,
ª 2016 European Sleep Research Society
Sleep patterns in MIDUS II 227
P = 0.73) or income as assessed in MIDUS I (t = 1.06;
P = 0.29). Sleep latency and duration within a 24-h period
were similar in both groups (all P > 0.10); however, nappers
had significantly less sleep per night (approximately 20 min;
P = 0.003) and had significantly less efficient sleep (average
sleep efficiency: P = 0.03).
Descriptives of health-related outcome variables are sum-
marized in Table 2. IL-6 levels, CRP levels, total number of
symptoms and conditions, as well as waist­hip ratios, were
significantly higher in nappers compared to non-nappers (see
Fig. 1). Similar findings were observed when using BMI as an
outcome variable instead of waist­hip ratio (P = 0.001). No
group differences were found for urinary endocrine markers,
HDL/LDL ratio, depressive symptoms or perceived chronic
stress levels (all P > 0.14).
To address the possibility that differences between nap-
pers and non-nappers in waist­hip ratio, IL-6 and CRP are
due to current health problems, analyses were repeated
controlling for number of symptoms and conditions; however,
none of the effects changed. Conversely, controlling for
obesity (BMI) eliminated the significant difference between
nappers and non-nappers for IL-6 (F = 1.33, P = 0.25), but
did not affect between-group effects for other variables.
Additionally, controlling for employment status did not affect
between-group effects for any variables. Lastly, none of the
above findings changed when controlling for effects of night-
time sleep duration, i.e. significant differences in health
outcomes between nappers and non-nappers remained
significant and non-significant differences remained non-
significant.

Sleep patterns
To test the possibility that, within nappers only, specific
patterns of sleep behaviour would be linked differentially to
health measures, self-reported nap behaviour and sleep
behaviour variables determined by actigraphy were next
subjected to a two-step cluster analysis resulting in a three-
cluster solution (BIC: 569.76; BIC ratio changes: 0.65;
average silhouette: 0.5). ANOVA confirmed centroid differences
for actigraphy sleep and nap variables and between-cluster
differences in sleep and demographic variables are summa-
rized in Table 3.
Figure 1. Participants napping at least once
a week showed significantly elevated C-
reactive protein levels and interleukin-6
levels, higher waist­hip ratios and a greater
number of total medical symptoms and
conditions compared to non-nappers.

Sleep patterns in MIDUS II 229
Participants in the three clusters did not differ in terms of
age, marital status, education level, employment status or race
(all P > 0.30). However, cluster 1 was dominated by women,
while the two genders were distributed evenly in clusters 2 and
3. Individuals in cluster 1 reported sleeping approximately
6.5 h on average per night and napping less frequently (less
than twice a week) than participants in other clusters.
Participants in cluster 2, in contrast, napped four to five times
per week and slept for approximately 6 h per night. Cluster 3
participants slept less, on average (approximately 5 h per
night), compared to clusters 1 and 2 and napped between two
and three times per week. Additionally, participants in cluster 3
had worse sleep efficiency and average sleep latency four
times greater than that of participants in clusters 1 or 2.
Differences in health indicators between sleep clusters
No significant differences between clusters were observed
for most of the biomarkers and total number of symptoms and
conditions (all P > 0.10). However, urinary NE levels differed
between clusters, with nappers in cluster 3 showing higher
NE levels compared to nappers in clusters 1 or 2 (F = 4.70;
P = 0.01) (see Fig. 2). Furthermore, individuals in the three
clusters differed significantly in terms of depressive symp-
toms (F = 4.03; P = 0.019) and perceived chronic stress
(F = 3.23; P = 0.041), such that participants in cluster 3
reported the highest levels of depressive symptoms and
perceived chronic stress while participants in cluster 1 had
the lowest CESD and PSS scores (see Fig. 2). This effect
pattern did not change when controlling for number of
symptoms and conditions or when controlling for obesity,
with the exception of the latter reducing the significant PSS
finding to a trend (F = 2.87, P = 0.06).
DISCUSSION
The current study investigated the associations between
sleep habits and health outcomes in American adults, taking
into account night-time sleep assessed via actigraphy as well
as self-reported nap behaviour. Interestingly, of 313 partic-
ipants, 208 reported napping between one and seven times
during the study week. Overall, individuals who reported
napping exhibited elevated levels of the inflammatory
biomarkers IL-6 and CRP, greater waist­hip ratios and a
larger number of total symptoms and conditions compared to
non-nappers. Within nappers, three distinct patterns of sleep
behaviour emerged that were characterized further by differ-
ential associations with NE, chronic stress levels and
depressive symptoms.
Sleep, demographic and health differences in nappers
and non-nappers
Approximately 66% of participants in the current study
reported napping during the course of a week. As such, our
findings are in line with earlier studies reporting prevalence
rates of napping in healthy adult populations in the range of
45­80% (Milner and Cote, 2009; Pilcher et al., 2001), with
higher rates being observed in adults above 60 years than
adults under 35 years of age (Buysse et al., 1992; Ohayon
et al., 2001; Yoon et al., 2003). Similarly, they replicate a lack
of differences between nappers and non-nappers in terms of
gender (Owens et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2003), race (Owens
et al., 2010) and average hours of sleep per 24-h period
(Jean-Louis et al., 2000; Lauderdale et al., 2008). As such,
nap behaviour shown in the current study appears to be
representative of sleep habits observed in other studies and
the general population.
With regard to health-related outcome measures, nappers
exhibited significantly higher IL-6 and CRP levels as well as
higher waist­hip ratios and more medical symptoms and
conditions. These findings are in line with observations
from earlier studies linking napping to obesity as well as
inflammation-related diseases (Foley et al., 2007; Hays
et al., 1996; Owens et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2010). Impor-
tantly, inflammation has been shown consistently to lead to
Figure 2. Differences in health indicators between sleep clusters showing insomnolent sleepers (cluster 3) exhibiting the highest levels of
urinary noradrenaline, depressive symptomatology [assessed by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CESD) scale] and perceived
chronic stress [assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS)]. Predominantly `night-time sleepers' describes participants in cluster 1, `siesta
sleepers' describes participants in cluster 2 and `insomnolent sleepers' describes participants in cluster 3.

pathological sleepiness (Cho et al., 2013), while obesity has
been related to daytime fatigue (Vgontzas et al., 1998). Thus,
feelings of fatigue may drive the urge to nap. Additionally,
inflammatory processes are linked closely to obesity (Park
et al., 2005) and both inflammation as well as adiposity are,
in turn, associated with overall morbidity and mortality,
particularly from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and other
chronic diseases (Wang et al., 2011). However, controlling
for number of medical conditions did not abolish the link
between napping and markers of inflammation or obesity,
suggesting a more complex role of napping.
Differential health effects of sleep patterns
Given nappers' elevated health risks as well as earlier
findings suggesting non-linear associations between napping
and health outcomes, we next investigated the potential of
sleep pattern-dependent health effects within nappers. Clus-
ter analysis thereby revealed three natural groupings (clus-
ters) of daytime and night-time sleep behaviour. One group of
individuals (cluster 1) slept predominantly at night, and only
napped infrequently during the study period. Participants in
this cluster exhibited sleep parameters comparable to non-
nappers, such as high sleep efficiency and duration, and
good self-reported sleep satisfaction. Participants in cluster 2
napped more days than not during the study week. This nap
behaviour resembles the siesta, which is defined commonly
as a traditional mid-day short nap practised by many cultures
worldwide. However, considering that time of day when naps
were taken was not recorded in the present MIDUS II
subproject, it is important to note that `siesta nappers' may
not be taking mid-afternoon naps, or be napping at a
consistent time of day across the cluster. In addition, when
compared to individuals in cluster 1, these siesta sleepers
did not exhibit any detriments in sleep latency or efficiency. A
third group of participants (cluster 3) exhibited the worst
night-time sleep of any of the groups and napped less than
siesta sleepers, but more than predominantly night sleepers.
It could be speculated that individuals in this third group are
insomnolent sleepers, in that they do not gain enough sleep
regardless of time of day.
While nappers exhibited elevated inflammation, obesity
and more medical conditions compared to non-nappers,
these health indicators were not associated differentially with
sleep behaviour patterns in the three groups of nappers. This
suggests that, contrary to earlier reports (Dinges, 1992), the
occurrence of napping per se may be indicative of increased
health problems related to obesity and inflammation, inde-
pendent of specific manifestations of sleep habits.
Contrarily, sleep behaviour differences within nappers were
related to NE levels and mental health outcome variables.
Insomnolent sleepers not only showed the highest NE levels,
but reported the highest number of depressive symptoms and
perceived the highest level of stress compared to predom-
inantly night or siesta sleepers. The current study is not the
first to observe the co-occurrence of elevated NE and mental
health effects in the context of sleep. A study by Mezick et al.
(2009) showed that NE was associated with higher sleep
fragmentation and moderated by negative affect (Mezick
et al., 2009). Furthermore, napping has been associated
repeatedly with depression (Foley et al., 2007). The current
findings suggest that frequency of napping per se may not be
responsible for this effect, as siesta sleepers showed similar
napping frequency without elevated depressive symptoms or
perceived stress levels. Instead, the poor night-time sleep
shown by insomnolent sleepers may be detrimental in terms of
elevated stress and depressive symptoms independently of
napping behaviour. Put differently, although napping has
been linked previously to increased risk for mental health
problems, daytime sleep behaviour may not be related to an
increased risk for depression provided that night-time sleep
quality is high. These findings lend support for an emphasis on
considering sleep as a complex behaviour consisting of
interdependent daytime and night-time occurrences of varying
lengths and quality.
Limitations
The current findings should be assessed in light of several
limitations. Primarily, participants were not distributed equally
into clusters. While the overall number in the present study
was sufficiently large to investigate sleep and health rela-
tionships, the smaller number for insomnolent sleepers
precluded the assessment of gender, age or race as
moderators. Secondly, the current study used cluster anal-
ysis to detect sleep behaviour patterns. While cluster analysis
allows for the grouping of variables, it does not provide
information on why certain variables may be clustered, and
future studies will have to characterize the determinants of
distinct sleep behaviour patterns. Thirdly, considering time of
day when napping occurred may be a promising additional
factor when assessing health effects of sleep behaviour,
given that naps taken in the evening may be more detrimen-
tal for night-time sleep quality (Milner and Cote, 2009).
Moreover, self-reported nap behaviour was not compared
with actigraphy data to confirm nap frequency or duration; nor
did participants record whether naps were premeditated or
spontaneous, information that may be helpful in determining
individual differences within nappers. Fourthly, habitual
napping is a potential marker for sleep apnea (Masa et al.,
2006). Future studies would benefit from including diagnostic
assessment of sleep apnea. Fifthly, self-reported sleep
assessed during the month prior to the study (PSQI:
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) correlated significantly with
the equivalent actigraphy-based sleep measures (data not
reported). However, multiple weeks of actigraphy data
collection would be needed to evaluate how well 1 week of
sleep assessment reflects an individual's sleep habits. Lastly,
statistical and conceptual concerns precluded the assess-
ment of links between sleep behaviour patterns and specific
disease patterns or syndromes, representing another promis-
ing avenue for future studies.

CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In summary, napping was a prevalent behaviour in the
assessed study population, with the majority of nappers
exhibiting shorter night-time sleep duration compared to non-
nappers. Independently of medical conditions or health effects
of shorter night-time sleep duration, however, individuals who
napped were more likely to show elevated inflammatory
processes and adiposity, suggesting that napping may indi-
cate greater distinct health risks over and above being a
consequence of ill health. When focusing on nappers only,
those showing a combination of less frequent napping and
poor night-time sleep exhibited higher chronic stress, depres-
sive symptoms and elevated NE levels. While napping can be
a consequence of stress and depression negatively affecting
night-time sleep, the current findings suggest that individuals
who nap may not be at a greater risk for depression as long as
their night-time sleep is sufficient in quantity and quality.
Therefore, the present study is a first step towards determining
which sleep behaviour changes may be promising for
decreasing negative health effects. In order to help tease
apart which sleep behaviours are benign and which should be
avoided, the next important step will be to identify the
determinants and underlying mechanisms differentiating func-
tional nap and night-time sleep behaviour patterns and sleep
patterns that are related to health detriments.
