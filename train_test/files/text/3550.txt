Employing meta-ethnography
in the analysis of qualitative
data sets on youth activism:
a new tool for transnational
research projects?

Abstract
This article outlines a novel application of meta-ethnographic synthesis in the analysis of multiple
ethnographic case studies of youth activism emanating from a large transnational European
research project. Although meta-ethnography is used increasingly as an alternative to systematic
review for the synthesis of published qualitative studies, it is not widely applied to the synthesis
of primary data. This article suggests such a use is not precluded epistemologically and potentially
addresses a growing need as ethnography itself becomes increasingly `multi-sited'. The article
outlines the practical process of adapting meta-ethnography to primary data analysis drawing on
the synthesis of 44 ethnographic cases of youth activism and provides a worked example of the
translation of cases and resulting `line of argument'. It discusses the challenges and limitations of
the approach in particular the danger that, in extracting the general from the specific, the key
quality of qualitative data ­ individual differentiation ­ is diminished.

This article discusses the dilemmas encountered by qualitative researchers analysing data
from large transnational research projects and suggests a potential solution in a novel appli-

political heritage, current levels and forms of civic and political engagement of young
people (16­25 years) in Europe, and their potential receptivity to radical and populist polit-
ical agendas. It generated (alongside survey data, n=16,935) a number of large qualitative
data sets2 from 30 locations in 14 languages. In summarising research findings across loca-
tions,3 while the survey team was able to employ a standard variable-based comparative
analysis strategy, the qualitative researchers struggled to identify a model for analysis that
would meet the need to speak beyond the individual `case'whilst not rooting the aspiration
to generalisability in false claims to representativeness.
This article suggests a potential solution to this dilemma in the adaptation of the meta-
ethnographic approach for the synthesis of primary data. Qualitative synthesis approaches
­ of which `meta-ethnography' is the most frequently employed (Hannes and Macaitis,
2012: 430)4 ­ have, to date, been applied primarily to the synthesis of published studies.
This article suggests there is potential for the meta-ethnographic approach to be employed
in the synthesis of primary qualitative data from multiple cases in large multi-location or
transnational research projects. This method may be of particular interest to qualitative
researchers working in large EU funded projects where the imperative to reap the `value
added' of a Europe-wide research project is often in tension with the epistemological
principle of retaining local language and context (central to understanding the phenom-
enon studied) and the organisational reality that the research is often conducted simulta-
neously across the European space but relatively discretely by nationally based teams. It
is an approach, however, that could be applied to a broader range of multi-sited qualita-
tive studies.
The article first sets out the core epistemological and methodological arguments
underpinning the adaptation of meta-ethnography for the synthesis of primary qualitative
data. Although meta-ethnography is currently employed primarily as an alternative to
systematic review for published qualitative studies, its use in the synthesis of primary
data is not precluded in its original formulation (see Noblit and Hare, 1988). Moreover,
its potential use for analysing multiple, transnational ethnographic studies is timely as
ethnographers seek to accommodate the increasingly transnational nature of ethnogra-
phy through the development of multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 1995, 2011) and iden-
tify ways to `extract the general from the unique' through the development of the
`extended case ethnography' (Burawoy, 1998: 5).
It is not the intention to set out here an alternative method for the analysis of all large
qualitative data sets; there are numerous robust methods for coding, analysing and inter-
preting primary qualitative data. Rather, this article draws on existing approaches includ-
ing classic (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) and revised (Strauss and Corbin, 1998) versions of
grounded theory and `multi-grounded theory' (Goldkuhl and Cronholm, 2010). These
methods underpin the now standard qualitative data analysis techniques of open, axial
and selective coding and present different models for generating and engaging theoreti-
cal concepts in the interpretative process. The approach developed here also draws on the
epistemological rationale for generalizing from the unique set out by Burawoy (1998) in
his `extended case method' and the empirical imperative to `follow' the object of obser-
vation since, in our globalised and networked world, it is increasingly present simultane-
ously in (or travels across) different locations (Marcus, 1995). What is new in the
approach outlined in this article is its specific concern with the interpretation of the
110 Qualitative Research 18(1)
findings of multiple research studies,5 each conducted in their own linguistic and cultural
contexts and coded and analysed independently by discrete, nationally based, research
teams. It seeks to address in this way a growing need for qualitative research methods
capable of synthesising the findings of a multiple, linked (but not strictly comparatively
designed) case studies generated by large, transnational qualitative research projects.
The article outlines the practical process of adapting meta-ethnography to primary
data analysis for the synthesis of 44 ethnographic cases of youth activism, relating the
process to key stages described in other published studies. This is followed by a worked
example of the translation6 of cases and the resulting `line of argument' that emerged
from the synthesis of research findings on the question of how young people interpret the
organisations in which they are active. Finally the challenges and limitations of the
approach are outlined, focusing on the concern that, in extracting the general from the
specific, the key quality of qualitative data ­ individual differentiation ­ is diminished.
Measures are suggested to ensure the `ethnography' in meta-ethnography is not lost.
From systematic review to conceptual innovation: the
principles of meta-ethnography
Qualitative synthesis approaches are employed most frequently in the field of health-
care studies to review the research evidence base in relation to particular approaches,
interventions or patient responses. Thus, although applied specifically to qualitative
research studies, this form of synthesis has been developed in the spirit of the `system-
atic review' used for the evaluation of statistical data to facilitate policy decisions about
`what works' (Dixon-Woods, 2006). Published studies demonstrate the value of the
qualitative synthesis approach for ensuring the best clinical treatments are promoted
(Campbell et al., 2011: 1) and preventing the reinvention of the wheel through conduct-
ing isolated qualitative studies without adequate reference to existing literature
(Sandelowski et al., 1997: 366).
This explains why much of the reflection on qualitative synthesis to date has focused
on: search techniques and selection procedures that ensure the inclusion of all relevant
studies (Hannes and Macaitis, 2012; Thomas and Harden, 2008; Campbell et al., 2003);
tools for evaluating the quality of studies (Barnett-Page and Thomas, 2009; Kuper et al.,
2008; Higgins and Green, 2011; Spencer et al., 2003); and adaptations allowing a larger
number of studies to be synthesised (Toye et al., 2014). It has led also to criticism that
meta-synthesis can slide into statistically rooted approaches of meta-analysis (Booth,
2001).
Synthesis is not, by definition, concerned with the `what works' approach of evi-
dence-based policy and practice, however; its origins lie in the building of cumulative
bodies of knowledge in the interests of conceptual and theoretical advancement (Weed,
2008: 26). It is rooted in an interpretative approach, which recognises that general rele-
vance can emerge from theoretical inference as well as empirical generalisation (Gomm
et al., 2000: 103). From this perspective, generalisability is not exclusively the property
of statistically secured representativeness but achievable through `idiographic generali-
zations'7 (Sandelowski et al., 1997: 367; Toye et al., 2014: 2) in which knowledge
extracted from rich descriptions of individual cases is viewed as transferable to other
Pilkington 111
studies (Lincoln and Guba, 1985 cited in Brannen and Nilsen, 2011: 615). Synthesis can
thus be understood as the integration of a set of parts that leads to `some degree of con-
ceptual innovation, or employment of concepts not found in the characterisation of the
parts' (Strike and Posner, 1983: 346 cited in Weed, 2008: 26).
In order to make the case that the principles of meta-ethnography are not incompatible
with its application to primary data it is first necessary to establish what distinguishes
qualitative synthesis approaches from secondary data analysis. Underlying this distinc-
tion is a differentiation between aggregation or `pooling' of the findings of separate
qualitative studies (Sandelowski et al., 1997) and interpretation of existing interpreta-
tions (arising out of qualitative data) in the interests of developing or refining concepts
and theory. Thus Campbell et al. (2011: ix) characterise qualitative synthesis as either
`integrative' (where data from primary studies are comparable and can be aggregated
often through quantitative analysis) or `interpretative'(in which concepts emerge through
a process of induction). Thus, like secondary analysis, qualitative synthesis involves re-
interpretation but, unlike secondary analysis, it is applied to published findings rather
than primary data (Britten et al., 2002: 209; Campbell et al., 2011: 2). Meta-ethnography
is placed within the `interpretative synthesis' category and considered capable of gener-
ating conceptual innovation in the form of a new interpretation or theory that goes
beyond the findings of any individual study (Campbell et al., 2011: 8). The process is
described by Campbell et al. (2011) as one in which `the synthesis builds interpretation
from original studies by firstly identifying interpretations offered by the original research-
ers (second-order constructs) and, secondly, enabling the development of new interpreta-
tions (third-order constructs) that go beyond those offered in individual primary studies'
(Campbell et al., 2011: 8).
While these distinctions ostensibly draw a clear line between meta-ethnography and
secondary data analysis, the latter may be regarded as a form of interpretive synthesis if
it involves multiple qualitative data sets and is conducted with the aim of providing a
new perspective or conceptual focus (Campbell et al., 2011: 8). Toye et al. (2014: 4),
moreover, suggest that there is no absolute distinction between the two enterprises since
`as description itself demands interpretation, it might be more useful to see aggregative
and interpretive approaches as two poles on a continuum rather than two distinct
approaches'.
The adaptation of the meta-ethnographic approach for the MYPLACE project is a
case in which secondary data analysis might be regarded as a form of interpretive syn-
thesis. That very few examples of such analysis have been published to date (and those
that have mainly involve the re-analysis of researchers' own data) may be for practical
methodological rather than fundamental epistemological reasons including: the ethical
issues involved in reusing data for a purpose other than originally specified; the lack of
familiarity with data collected by other researchers; and variations in research design
across different studies (Campbell et al., 2011: 8). These problems are avoided or mini-
mised in the MYPLACE meta-ethnographic synthesis because the data were collected
within the framework of a single project governed by common ethical protocols, research
instruments and analysis strategy. This has some precedent in the field since Noblit and
Hare's (1988: 39) worked examples of synthesis included Noblit's own studies.
112 Qualitative Research 18(1)
The exclusion of primary data from qualitative synthesis is rooted in the statement
that `the data of synthesis are interpretations and explanations rather than the data col-
lected through interviews and observations' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 32). This logic, it is
suggested here, makes more rigid a distinction between `data' and their `interpretation'
than qualitative research warrants. In practice, published articles based on qualitative
data frequently employ concepts that are `grounded' in understandings articulated
directly by respondents while `primary' qualitative data consist of respondents' under-
standings and interpretations of the world. Meta-ethnography is understood here, there-
fore, as `the synthesis of interpretative research' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 10) that might
be applied in a variety of ways from conducting `interpretivist literature reviews'through
`the systematic comparison of case studies to draw cross-case conclusions' to construct-
ing `a synthesis of ethnographic studies' (Noblit and Hare, 1988: 11­13). In the follow-
ing section, it is demonstrated how such a synthesis of ethnographic case studies can be
conducted on the basis of primary data sets.
A key challenge for meta-ethnographic synthesis is that, in contrast to positivist
approaches, which seek to minimize and/or control for context effects, a reflexive social
science starts from the premise that `context is not noise disguising reality but reality
itself' (Burawoy, 1998: 13). While this is not the place to review developments in the
field of ethnography more generally, it is important to recognise that its direction of
travel is convergent with that of meta-ethnography in two important ways. Firstly, there
is an increasing recognition of the need to move beyond the single case study and to
reflect the transnational and mobile nature of the `thing' studied through `multi-sited
ethnography' that goes beyond `conventional controlled comparison' in anthropology
(Marcus, 1995: 102). This is important for the purposes of meta-ethnography in that it
recognises the potential `unevenness'(`thick'but also `thin') of cases (Marcus, 2011: 21)
and a move towards collective research practices (Marcus, 2011: 22). Secondly, develop-
ments in the ethnographic method have called for researchers to `extend out' from the
field in a way that allows a form of generalisation to which meta-ethnography also
aspires. This is a particular concern of Burawoy (1998: 5) who proposes an `extended
case method' that allows the extraction `of the general from the unique'. While for
Burawoy this is achieved primarily through the forefronting of pre-existing theory, the
recognition within his `reflexive social science' of the possibility, and desirability, of
generalisation from single ethnographic cases is consistent with the principles of meta-
ethnography. Notwithstanding the danger of the `dilution' of the particular, it is argued
below that the application of meta-ethnography to primary data rather than published
studies allows for the retention of context and `thick description'.
Applying meta-ethnography to primary data: practical
steps
In the MYPLACE project, meta-ethnography was adapted to primary data analysis in the
synthesis of 44 ethnographic cases of youth activism in 14 countries.8 The MYPLACE
project as a whole did not employ a strict comparative design but a case study approach
that prioritised the retention of context (Pilkington and Pollock, 2015a: 21­28). In this
Pilkington 113
context, ethnographic case studies (three per country) were selected from those induc-
tively identified by national research teams as reflecting locally and nationally relevant
forms of youth activism. The ethnographies were designed to explore the meanings
attached to activism among young people engaged in organisations and movements
ranging from student self-organisation and youth sections of political parties through
anarchist and Occupy groups to radical right wing movements. Cases were grouped in
six thematic clusters of between six and nine cases: radical right and patriotic move-
ments; anti-capitalist/anti-racist/anti-fascist movements; anti-austerity/Occupy move-
ments; gender and minority rights movements; youth sections of political, labour and
state-sponsored organisations; and religion-based organisations. Case studies located at
the intersection of clusters were included in both relevant clusters (indicated in Table 1
by the use of italics in the `secondary' cluster).
The synthesis of cases was rooted in the seven-stage process outlined by Noblit and
Hare (1988: 26­29) guided by practical reflections on its implementation in Britten et al.
(2002). The application of the method to primary data rather than published studies
required significant adaptation of the early stages of the meta-ethnographic process since
studies did not need to be selected and were already familiar. The outcome was a five-
stage process (see Text Box 1) discussed below in two parts: the construction of the data
set (Stages 1­3); and the synthesis process (Stages 4­5).
Constructing the data set
In contrast to the complex selection protocols discussed in other meta-ethnographies, the
boundaries of the data set for this synthesis were determined by the MYPLACE study
(see Table 1).
Full methodological details of the studies are beyond the scope of this article (see
Pilkington, 2014; Pilkington and Mizen, 2015) but it should be noted that researchers
worked to an agreed framework and guidelines for what constituted an ethnographic
case study rather than micro-methodological instructions. This meant that studies var-
ied in type ­ particularly in their use of classic `participant observation' or more `vir-
tual' (internet or social media based) modes of ethnography ­ and each employed a
unique combination of fieldwork techniques (including semi or unstructured interviews,
field diaries, informal conversations, documentary materials and visual images). This
meant that an important early stage of the process was a scoping of the data during
which synthesisers familiarised themselves with the relative `thickness' or `thinness' of
accounts in each case.
These case studies were analysed discretely and published as individual case reports,9
which constituted potential units for meta-ethnographic synthesis. In the interests of

retaining as much `ethnography' in meta-ethnography as possible, however, data sets
including elements of the primary data were constructed for each study. This was imple-
mented through the production of two sets of `memos ­ `node memos' and `respondent
memos' ­ which, together with the case study reports, constituted the data sets for the
synthesis of cases at cluster level. Node memos and respondent memos were written fol-
lowing the coding of the primary data for each case study and provided researcher gener-
ated summaries of the thematic codes (`node10 memos') and individual respondents
(`respondent memos'). Coding was conducted employing standard methods of open,
axial and selective coding facilitated by the use of Nvivo 9.2 software.11 Researchers
were asked to code, in the first instance, to a maximum of two hierarchical levels. Codes
were assigned in the language of the interviews; this retained the subtle meanings and
cultural cues which would have been lost if initial coding had been conducted on inter-
views translated into English (Team members, 2006: 59). The lowest hierarchical level
of coding was named `Level 1 nodes'; these were open codes expressing respondents'
own views, accounts, descriptions and interpretations of their experiences. The guide-
lines provided to researchers stated that Level 1 nodes should include attitudes, reflec-
tions, opinions, emotions or meanings attached to phenomena by respondents but should
not include coders'own evaluation of such attitudes.12 Researchers were also encouraged
to keep as close as possible to the expressions of respondents when creating Level 1
nodes and illustrative quotes in English were included in the node memo to allow the
synthesiser to feel the texture of the primary data.At the second hierarchical level, `Level
2 nodes' grouped Level 1 nodes through a process of axial coding. This often generated
rather descriptive categories (such as `forms of activism' or `political views') in contrast
to the more `authentic' Level 1 nodes.
Once coding at these two initial levels was complete, researchers created `node
memos' in English for each case study. Node memos are thematic memos generated in
the form of simple Word documents for each Level 2 node and consist of the descriptions
of the content of Level 2 nodes and their constituent Level 1 nodes as well as illustrative
quotes for each Level 1 node. Node memos also included a summary of the context of
the generation of the Level 2 node (including particular theoretical paradigms drawn on
or important contextual factors such as historical or political events). These node memos
constituted the primary objects of synthesis and in some cases ran to more than 30 pages.
In addition, `respondent memos' were generated in English for each individual respond-
ent,13 providing a reference point for the main socio-demographic characteristics of the
respondent and other contextual information of relevance to the interpretation of the
data. Illustrative examples of node and respondent memos can be found in Pilkington
and Mizen (2015: 10­24). The data sets constructed for synthesis are thus far from `raw'
data. They consisted of respondents' accounts and interpretations of their views and
actions, articulated as close to their original expression as possible, alongside research-
ers' interpretations (in the process of coding and node memo production) of these
interpretations.
Finally, five questions were agreed to guide the synthesis. While in meta-ethnogra-
phies of published studies, the definition of the area of interest is usually the first stage
of synthesis, in this study, the broad area of interest had been pre-defined in the Work
Package description as `interpreting activism' by `understanding the meanings young
Pilkington 117
people attach to their activism'. For the purposes of synthesis, this needed to be narrowed
and, following a preliminary reading of the materials in their cluster level data sets, five
questions14 were agreed by the researchers involved in the synthesis with the anticipation
that between five and ten concepts (constructs, metaphors) would emerge in each cluster
in relation to each question.
The synthesis process
The building blocks of the meta-ethnographic approach are the second-order concepts
and metaphors and `third-order' interpretations that are generated (Britten et al., 2002:
213; Lee et al., 2015: 347). Definitions of first, second and third-order constructs differ
in the published literature (Malpass et al., 2009: 158) although there is consensus on the
underlying process:
Meta-ethnography involves identifying key concepts from studies and translating them into one
another. The term `translating' in this context refers to the process of taking concepts from one
study and recognising the same concepts in another study, though they may not be expressed
using identical words. Explanations or theories associated with these concepts are also extracted
and a `line of argument' is developed which pulls these concepts together and, crucially, goes
beyond the content of the original studies. (Thomas and Harden, 2008: 5)
The synthesis of ethnographic case studies of youth activism outlined here was under-
taken in two stages: the translation of the meanings of one case into another (producing
second-order `concepts'); and the generation of `third-order' interpretations.
The translation process in this study was not of concepts extracted from published
literature but respondents' own interpretations as coded, categorised, contextualised and
interpreted in node memos, respondent memos and case study reports. These materials
were read repeatedly in the process of the translation of the meanings of one case into
another, where necessary clarifying context and interpretation with the field researchers.
This process was facilitated by creating a table (adapted from Britten et al., 2002) to
record and describe the emergent second-order concepts. Table 2 provides an illustration
of such a table constructed from the translation of cases in Cluster 1 (Radical right and
patriotic movements) in relation to the first of the five guiding questions (`How do young
people inhabit, interpret and own their organisations?'). This table illustrates one of five
concepts ­ `an organisation of the people' ­ that emerged in the process of translating
respondents' interpretations of the organisations in which they were active in the nine
cases included in this cluster. As Malpass et al., (2009: 158) note, the use of the term
`translation' indicates that, at this stage, the synthesiser is comparing concepts, each
infused with its own interpretation, and thus engaged in an interpretive `reading' of
meaning, but not further conceptual development. Indeed, in this case `an organisation of
the people' is a respondent's interpretation, into which the meanings of other cases could
be reciprocally translated.
Noblit and Hare (1988: 36) propose three forms of translation: cases are directly com-
parable as `reciprocal' translations; cases stand in opposition to each other and are thus
`refutational'; cases are diverse but, taken together, represent a `line of argument' rather

than a reciprocal or refutational translation. All three kinds of translation were antici-
pated in the analyses conducted for MYPLACE and this is indicated in the concept
tables. The concept `an organisation of the people' emerged as a mainly reciprocal trans-
lation although refutational or partially refutational cases are also recorded and indicated
by italic font (see Table 2). In practice, a single meta-ethnography may include all three
types of translation (Campbell et al., 2011: 24; Dixon-Woods et al., 2006: 103), and in
the case of the meta-ethnographic syntheses outlined here, the diversity of the data meant
that the end product was usually `a line of argument' developed on the basis of the recip-
rocal translation of cases but taking account of refutational or partially refutational cases.
An illustrative example of such a line of argument is presented below.
The final stage of analysis is the generation of `third-order' interpretations. This stage
remains the most opaque in existing literature since it involves determining what additional
insight is brought to the research questions through the synthesis of cases and it is the stage
least open to procedural systematisation. Recognising the danger of overstating the capac-
ity of third-level interpretations to give rise to `a new order of understanding' (Lee et al.,
2015: 347), the aim here was to generate a qualitative synthesis that extends knowledge
over and above the sum of the individual case studies included in the study whilst recognis-
ing that it may also be that no new insight emerges (Campbell et al., 2011: 119). This
reflects also the relationship between theory and method underpinning the MYPLACE
approach, which diverges from Noblit and Hare's (1988: 37) aim to induce `grounded'
theory, in favour of Burawoy's (2003: 647) insistence on the `necessity of bringing theory

Interpretation `Organisations of the people' and `leaderless' movements are associated
primarily with understandings of contemporary social movements of a
left-wing, anarchist, anti-austerity persuasion. The fact that such concepts
were identified by this synthesis among patriotic and radical right activists
challenges literature that suggests organisations of the extreme right
tend towards a hierarchical structure with individual (usually male) and
charismatic leaders.

to the field'. Theory is essential to interpretation and knowledge production and is envis-
aged as being revised, refined or `reconstructed' rather than generated anew. Drawing on
Goldkuhl and Cronholm's (2010) explication of a `multi-grounded theory' approach,
inductive coding at the first two levels of analysis was followed by a process of `theoretical
matching'and validation against both data and existing theoretical frameworks at the third
or interpretative level.15 The third-level interpretations were recorded at the bottom of each
concept emerging from the translation (see Table 2) and it is the synthesis of these third
level interpretations that produces the line of argument.
In this study, translation was carried out primarily as a synthesis of the individual case
studies in each of the six clusters (as stipulated in the original research design).
Subsequently, however, a synthesis across clusters was conducted of concepts of particu-
lar interest to produce a `line of argument' translation based on all 44 cases.
Dispersed leadership: a worked example of meta-
ethnographic synthesis using primary data
The transnational analysis of MYPLACE ethnographic data was designed for implemen-
tation at cluster level. However, a more limited `synthesis of the syntheses' was con-
ducted across clusters consisting in the identification of the second-order concepts
emerging in each cluster and their translation into one another. Table 3 provides an over-
view16 of the concepts extracted from cluster syntheses for the question `How do young
people inhabit, interpret and own their organisations?' The concept `an organisation of
the people' derived from the Cluster 1synthesis described above, for example, can be
seen in the top left hand box of Table 3. This process revealed a possible reciprocal syn-
thesis of concepts related to leadership and hierarchy (see Table 3, row 1) and was
expressed through a new concept of `dispersed leadership'. However, there were also
refutational cases (Table 3, italic font) as well as diversity within some cases (especially
Cluster 6). After further testing against data (returning to the case study materials) and
against theories suggesting `horizontality' and `non-hierarchy' are associated tradition-
ally with left-wing, anarchist and radical democratic movements (Purkis, 2001), a line of
argument was developed and expressed in the concept of `dispersed leadership'.
`Dispersed leadership' emerged from a reciprocal translation of the concepts of `an
organisation of the people', `unofficial leadership', `leaderless and horizontal move-
ments'and `blurry leadership'derived from the synthesis of cases in Clusters 1­4 respec-
tively. It is epitomised by cases in Cluster 3 where young activists in local Occupy
movements in Denmark and the UK demonstrated a self-conscious rejection of organisa-
tional hierarchies and the representative principle of decision-making in favour of lead-
erless, horizontal and directly representative democratic organisations. The commitment
to leaderless and horizontal movements was described as the `golden thread' (LO, GB)17
uniting the Occupy movement but was found across a broad range of anti-austerity
movements included in the cluster (Mizen, 2015: 18­19). However, the synthesis of
cases across clusters revealed that the concept of `leaderless' movements connotes not
the absence of leadership but its dispersal (Wadia, 2015: 12). This is expressed in
respondents' interpretations of the movements in which they were active as organised
such that `we are all leaders' (Wadia, 2015: 12­16) or `decisions are taken by all of us

together' (Sakellariou, 2015: 11). This generates a collective responsibility, accountabil-
ity and efficacy articulated in interpretations of movements as governed not by hierarchy
but equal opportunities to make suggestions, act and express opinions (Litvina, 2015:
13). In this way, leadership is not negated but `blurred'. This emerges especially in the
case of gender and minority rights organisations where blurred lines of leadership serve
both to resist conventional authority and hierarchy and to evade attempts by hostile
authorities to neutralise or `decapitate' movements (Wadia, 2015: 13). Such `blurring' is
identified also among anti-capitalist, anti-racist and anti-fascist movements where activ-
ists identify a kind of `unofficial leadership' based on an informal hierarchy rooted in
longevity and intensity of activist experience (Litvina, 2015: 12­14).
The line of argument developed here emerged to accommodate, on the one hand, refu-
tational cases and, on the other, the unanticipated reciprocal translation of cases. At clus-
ter level, the refutational case is that of Youth sections of formal political, labour and
state-sponsored organisations (Cluster 5) since in these organisations, positions within
the organisation are determined often by democratic elections, leading to competition
between members for clearly defined leadership positions (Hashem-Wangler, 2015: 12­
13). In contrast, among the Radical right and patriotic movements studied, four of the
nine organisations were interpreted by their members as `leaderless' despite suggestions
in existing literature, that, following the dominant understanding of populist radical right
organisations as a `normal pathology' (Mudde, 2007: 297), organisations in this cluster
were likely to be characterised by hierarchical structures and charismatic leadership
(Wodak, 2013: 28; Stutje, 2012: 2). In fact, the only case to follow this rule was Golden
Dawn (GR), which prides itself on `absolute discipline and faith in its leadership'
(Pilkington, 2015: 17); invoking the Führerprinzip embedded in the ideology of the
NSDAP (Fielding, 1981: 17) and reflecting the party's neo-Nazi positioning. In three
organisations in this cluster, formal structures and leaders were identified but activists
experienced their movements as governed by an informal ethos of collective ownership
expressed as `an organisation of the people' (MM, SK) and `leadership' was understood
as the initiation of collective endeavour (EDL, GB). These cases could be reciprocally
translated, therefore, alongside a number of movements in the Gender and minority
rights cluster, which also had clear organisational structures and identified `leaders'
although activists experienced that leadership as diffuse, communicative and consulta-
tive (Wadia, 2015: 13).
The line of argument derived from this synthesis of 44 ethnographic case studies of
youth activism conducted for the MYPLACE project thus contributes to a re-emergent
interest in leadership and decision making aspects of social movements (Barker, Johnson
and Lavalette, 2001: 3). It confirms the shift identified among many protest movements
towards organisational forms characterised by horizontality (Della Porta, 2015: 159) and
without clearly identifiable leaders (Castells, 2012) whilst generating new insight
through its demonstration of greater consistency across the left-right political spectrum
than suggested in that literature.18 Organisations of the radical right, normally associated
with charismatic leaders and strict hierarchies, were found to adopt a `leaderless' struc-
ture or reserve a critical attitude to their own hierarchies. There is not scope in this article
to reflect on the possible explanations for this convergence. However, other emergent
concepts from the cross-cluster synthesis demonstrate that certain shared values and
Pilkington 123
experiences ­ non-conformism, self-ascribed outsider status, confrontation with authori-
ties ­ direct activists of the right as well as the left away from movements with a strong
internal hierarchy and leadership. Examples of concepts derived from the wider synthe-
sis that feed into the emergent line of argument illustrated in Figure 1 are denoted in the
circles. Envisaging their own movements as `open to all' emerged as a means by which
young activists distance themselves from more orthodox far left or far right groups char-
acterised by closed, secretive or democratic centralist structures. The concept `politics is
not us' reflects the wider disavowal of `traditional' politics, political parties and modes
of leadership across the activist spectrum captured in the synthesis of concepts related to
the question `What are young activists' perceptions of politics/the political?'
Preserving the ethnography in meta-ethnography:
reflection and evaluation
The meta-ethnographic synthesis approach was developed by researchers themselves
engaged in ethnography in order to facilitate the generation of strong interpretive expla-
nations by deriving understanding from multiple cases while retaining the sense of the
original accounts (Campbell et al., 2011: 10). However, there is an inherent danger that,
as the meta-interpretations of the synthesiser are added to those of the researcher and the
research participant, the nuances of data will be in lost in a process of `triple averaging'
(Weed, 2008: 22). While recognising the risk that synthesis thins out the thickness
Figure 1. Line of argument: `dispersed leadership'
124 Qualitative Research 18(1)
embedded in the original studies (Sandelowski et al., 1997: 366), it is argued here that the
application of meta-ethnography to primary data helps retain as much detail as possible
from individual cases and protect against a slide into the proceduralism that may charac-
terise the systematic review of quantitative research.
The approach outlined in this article does this in a number of ways. First, the use of
primary data (in the form of `node memos') as the unit of synthesis allows concepts to be
derived directly from the articulation by respondents of their experience and significant
detail and differentiation from the original studies to be retained well into the analysis
process. Secondly, by retaining a commitment to including `refutational' data in the syn-
thesis, cases that are `exceptions' or `outliers' can be used to enhance understanding ­
through the development of a `line of argument'­ rather than excluded because they lack
`fit'. Indeed, the refutational translation acts as a powerful reminder not to seek similarity
alone and to question why some concepts `work' (in terms of reciprocal translation) bet-
ter than others. Thirdly, meta-ethnography did not substitute ethnography but added to it
by extracting the general from the unique over and above the contributions made by
individual case studies. The MYPLACE research design was premised on an inductive
selection of cases that prioritised the importance of contextual validity. While analysis
protocols provided a systematic process of coding to two levels, this was completed in
the local language and thereafter each team generated their own third-level interpreta-
tions and published their findings as discrete projects. Thus this method (unlike a strict
comparative design) allowed the synthesis of findings alongside the production of unique
case studies interpreted in context. Fourthly, this inductive approach meant that the con-
cepts that emerged from the synthesis were not pre-defined by parameters for compari-
son rooted in the research design (and thus on secondary literature rather than primary
data). This ensured that the synthesis was capable of eliciting concepts that were genu-
inely unforeseen (although this does not happen in every case). Finally, criticisms that
the thickness of description and depth of scrutiny during synthesis is compromised when
meta-ethnography is applied to more than a very few cases was addressed by adopting a
two-tier process of synthesis. This two-tier synthesis of clusters of cases (n=6­9), fol-
lowed by a synthesis of derived concepts across all cases (n=44), is not dissimilar to that
conducted by Campbell et al. (2011: x) in their synthesis of published studies (n=38) of
medicine-taking for chronic illness for which they first conducted a synthesis of studies
by medicine groups and subsequently incorporated all groups in a thematic synthesis.
The application of meta-ethnographic synthesis to primary data nonetheless presents
some major challenges. First, although all cases synthesised in this study were drawn
from a common research project (supported by cross-project guidelines and protocols)
differences between data remained. This was partially a result of the inductive process of
selection of cases which meant that some clusters contained `outliers' defying reciprocal
translation. Rather than excluding cases that appeared not to add value to the synthesis
(Weed, 2008: 18; Campbell et al., 2003: 671; Toye et al., 2014: 7), in this study, such cases
were retained and recorded as `missing'in relation to those aspects of the synthesis where
they demonstrated `lack of fit'. A second challenge lies in the unevenness of cases inher-
ent in any multi-sited ethnography (Marcus, 2011: 21). While some studies were deeply
ethnographic, including extensive field diaries, visual data and semi-structured inter-
views, others were based on substantial interview material but afforded less opportunity
Pilkington 125
for ethnographic observation while a number were primarily document-based studies
using web materials and official documents supplemented by a smaller number of inter-
views or observations. These differences often explain why some cases are `missing'from
translations; cases based primarily on web-based analysis, for example, could not contrib-
ute significantly to the synthesis of findings on respondents' experiences of activism. A
third, and practically most difficult, challenge in conducting the synthesis was the differ-
ent modes of coding employed in different cases. Despite working to a common data
analysis strategy with specific guidance on coding, the number of both first and second
level nodes varied greatly, as did the degree of detail provided in the `node memos'. This
was due in part to the highly labour intensive nature of the construction of the data sets for
synthesis and is reflected in unevenness in the contribution of cases to the synthesis.
Finally, the evident benefit of team members conducting different meta-ethnographies
simultaneously and sharing reflections on the process (Lee et al., 2015: 340) was not fully
realised due to the transnational nature of the team and the strict reporting deadlines of the
project.
Conclusion
Meta-ethnographic synthesis enables a body of qualitative research to be drawn together
in a systematic way through a process of reciprocally translating the findings from each
study into those from all the other studies in the synthesis (Campbell et al., 2011: xi).
Thus, meta-ethnography allows researchers concerned with the richness and texture of
the social world, and interpretations of it, to speak beyond the individual case. Whether
meta-ethnography produces conceptual innovation ­ through the generation of concepts
above and beyond those found in the analyses of individual studies ­ remains an open
question. There is evidence that in some cases synthesis has produced major new insights,
through the development of `third order' concepts. However, even in cases where such
insight is not generated (Campbell et al., 2011: 119), the meta-ethnographic synthesis,
like the systematic review, is a valuable tool for rigorously reviewing the existing knowl-
edge base before the implementation of new qualitative research.
This article has set out a case for the application of meta-ethnography to the synthesis
of primary data. While this contravenes usual distinctions between `secondary data anal-
ysis' and the synthesis of published studies, as primary qualitative data sets become
increasingly available to other researchers through archiving, there is likely to be height-
ened interest in strategies and protocols for synthesising the findings of qualitative
research (Campbell et al., 2011: 9). The current article draws on the experience of adapt-
ing the meta-ethnographic synthesis approach to the interpretation of multiple ethno-
graphic case studies emanating from a single transnational research project to start a
dialogue about how such protocols and procedures might look.
Notwithstanding the challenges encountered, the application of the meta-ethnographic
method to the analysis of MYPLACE ethnographic case studies provided a resolution to
the dilemma faced by qualitative researchers noted at the start of this article. It did so by
employing a mode of analysis in which the contextual `noise' constitutive of qualitative
research was retained while generating significant `value added' over and above what
could be derived from the post-hoc comparison of discrete case studies. It is hoped that
126 Qualitative Research 18(1)
the experience of its implementation outlined here might be taken up and developed by
other teams engaged in similar transnational or multi-sited projects in a way that will
enable qualitative researchers to speak beyond the individual case.

1. The MYPLACE project was funded under the European Union Seventh Framework
Programme (Grant Agreement: FP7-266831) and coordinated by Hilary Pilkington.
2. This article considers one of those data sets consisting of 823 semi-structured interviews,
field diaries, textual documents, visual and website materials resulting from 44 ethnographic
case studies.
 3. The substantive findings of the project are not discussed here other than where they serve
to illustrate the method employed but are published in Pilkington and Pollock (2015b) and

4. Other synthesis approaches include: `meta-interpretation' (Weed, 2008), `qualitative meta-
synthesis' (Sandelowski et al., 1997), `critical interpretive synthesis' (Dixon-Woods et al.,
2006) and `thematic analysis' (Thomas and Harden, 2008).
 5. Even Burawoy (1998: 11), in outlining the extended case method, draws on examples that
involve just two cases (of the same phenomenon in a single country, in one example, and of a
contemporary and earlier study in the second example).
6. `Translation' refers here to a specific stage of meta-ethnographic synthesis and is defined
below.
 7. `Idiographic' signals the retention of cases as individual and unique but generalisable across
different contexts, times (occasions) or subgroups of a case in contrast to generalisation of the
sample to the whole population (see: Lincoln and Guba, 2000: 33).
 8. The target group for the survey and interview elements of the project was 16­25 year olds
but for the ethnographic case studies the age range was extended given the importance of
authoritative figures or gatekeepers in some cases. The principle criterion for inclusion in the
ethnographic case sample was activism in the identified organisation, movement or practice.

article.
11. Nvivo software was employed primarily to maximise the potential for effective team work-
ing, the sharing of data sets between national teams and triangulation between qualitative data
sets gathered within the wider MYPLACE project. Nvivo also allowed socio-demographic
data related to individual respondents to be entered into the data base of coded materials and

used to search across data sets in order to explore, for example, gendered patterns of activism
or differences in understandings of activism among younger and older cohorts.

was provided in the MYPLACE Qualitative Data Analysis Handbook available to researchers
via the project intranet.

18. The debate on the relationship between leadership, social movements and ideology is more
complex than can be reflected in this methodologically focused article. It should be noted
that the term `leaderless resistance' was in fact coined by the extreme right (white suprema-
cist) movement in the USA in the 1980s (Garfinkel, 2003) and is used increasingly today
to discuss new forms of jihadi terrorism (Sageman, 2008). Moreover, while Occupy and
other anti-austerity movements may have been understood initially as classically `leaderless'
(Castells, 2012), empirically rooted studies increasingly problematise this characterisation
(Wengronowitz, 2013).
