Introduction and motivation
Gender bias is an important issue and problem throughout
all sections of society, politics, and culture, and academia is
not immune. While not the first study within the social sci-
ences on citation gaps, Maliniak et al. (2013) showed that a
gender gap was detectable in international relations (IR)
citation patterns. They find that across 10 different model
specifications, `all female'IR articles are cited significantly
less than articles by men. This matters because citations
often equate to research impact and impact affects tenure
decisions, promotions, and job opportunities.
Zigerell's (2015) recent article in this journal shows that
changing the model specifications through including or
removing variables, restricting the data to various percen-
tiles, expanding the time line, and including other types of
articles, that Maliniak et al.'s findings are not robust. Based
on these findings, Zigerell (2015) simply cautions readers
to consider nuances in the citation gap in IR.
In this comment, I use Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG)
regression to replicate both Maliniak et al.'s and Zigerell's
analysis of the IR citation gap. The PIG model is ideal for
count distributions where there is a large initial peak and
then a very long tail of observations (Hilbe, 2014). Citation
data almost perfectly fit such a distribution: most articles
receive a handful of citations, while a few pieces receive
thousands. In the replications, I show that PIG is the pre-
ferred model for all of Maliniak et al.'s and nearly all of
Zigerell's specifications, and that both articles make valid
points on the existence and scope of a gender gap in IR
citations. However, a gender gap is only observable in
some of Maliniak et al.'s models, and not all, and a gender
gap is observable in many of Zigerell's models, and not
just two.
Below I briefly discuss the PIG model before moving to
the replications.
PIG regression
Since King (1988), most political and social scientists
understand that using linear regression is problematic when
dealing with count distributions. Further, most researchers
are aware that due to ubiquitous overdispersion negative

Poisson inverse Gaussian regression
on citation data

Abstract
Zigerell's recent article in Research & Politics argues that Maliniak et al.'s findings that women are cited less than men
in international relations are not robust to alternative specifications. Using Poisson inverse Gaussian (PIG) regression,
in this comment, I demonstrate that both papers' findings are sensitive to empirical specifications. In many model
specifications, women are cited less than men, but other specifications either show a null effect or that women are
actually cited more than men in international relations. This illustrates that substantive model selections matter a great
deal for the conclusions we can make from our data.

binomial (NB) regression is almost always preferred to
Poisson regression. However, other count models have yet
to be widely adopted throughout the social sciences. PIG is
one such model.
The PIG model is actually quite similar to the NB
model, where both include a dispersion parameter and are
a mixture of two distributions (NB is a mixture of Poisson
and gamma distributions, while PIG is a mixture of Poisson
and inverse Gaussian distributions).1 The specific differ-
ence between PIG and NB is that PIG includes a cubic
variance function ( µ µ
+ 3 ), while NB (in the standard
NB2 parameterization) includes a squared variance function
( µ µ
+ 2 ) (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). This simple dif-
ference, though, allows PIG to better handle long-tailed
count data (Cameron and Trivedi, 2013). In this paper, the
PIG model uses a variant of the Sichel distribution since it
is how the user-written Stata PIG command is parametrized
(Hardin and Hilbe, 2012); however, see Cameron and
Trivedi (2013) for a brief discussion of several other
parameterizations.2
Replications
Maliniak et al. (2013)
In Maliniak et al. (2013), models 1­10 in their original
Table 2 all show that `all female' international relations
publications receive significantly (at the 0.05 or 0.10 lev-
els) fewer citations than publications by men. In Table 1, I
replicate their models using their original NB model and
the PIG model. For ease of presentation, I only include the
`all female' results and the Akaike information criteria
(AIC) for model comparison.
Looking first at the AIC values, we see that the PIG
model is preferred over NB for all 10 models. Not only
does the PIG model make intuitive sense to use over NB,
due to the distribution of the data, but the PIG model fits the
data better than NB. Therefore, we have more confidence in
the results from the PIG model than the NB model.
Figure 1 graphically illustrates the distribution of the
citation data and fitted probabilities for the NB and PIG
distributions. First, observe the heavily skewed distribution
where a bulk of the observations occur early on but obser-
vations still exist out to 1084. Second, note that the PIG
distribution fits the early counts slightly better than the NB
distribution. However, as noted above, the PIG distribu-
tion's main benefit is in fitting the tail end of count distribu-
tions; which unfortunately is difficult to graphically
demonstrate with the citation data.
In examining the results for `all female', we see that pub-
lications by women are cited significantly less in models 1,
2, 3, 7, 9, and 10. In the other four models, there is no statis-
tically significant result for `all female'. However, one could
argue that since `all female'is significant in Maliniak et al.'s
`kitchen sink'model (model 10) that a gender gap does exist
in IR citations. Further, in the PIG results where `all female'
is significant, the effect size is smaller than in the NB results.
For example, in model 1 using NB, an all female article
decreases the expected number of citations by 4.96; while
using PIG, an all female article decreases the expected num-
ber of citations by just 0.556.3 There would be less to criti-
cize if Maliniak et al. only included the `kitchen sink'model

in their original paper. But, by trying to show `all female' is
always significant in a succession of models, a version of
sensitivity analysis (Angrist and Pischke, 2010), we actually
find that Maliniak et al.'s findings are sensitive to what
predictors are included in a model. This is an example where
substantively justifying why certain predictors are included
in an analysis may be a better approach than atheoretically
trying various combinations of predictors.

Zigerell (2015)
Zigerell's (2015) main approach is to question the predic-
tors and data used in Maliniak et al.'s study through a series
of NB regressions. As nicely illustrated in Figure 1 of
Zigerell (2015), he systematically removes certain predic-
tors, adds in other predictors and new data, and trims the
top percentiles across 15 models of the citation data.
Zigerell finds that besides from the `kitchen sink' model,
there is only one other instance where a statistically signifi-
cant citation gap exists between men and women in IR cita-
tions: a model that includes the temporal and geographical
foci of the studies.As above, in Table 2, I replicate Zigerell's
findings using both NB and PIG models, and only include
the `all female' results and AIC.4
First examining the AIC values, we see that the PIG
model is preferred over NB for 14 of the 15 models; how-
ever, PIG is only slightly preferred over NB in model 15. In
model 13, the NB model is likely preferred over the PIG
model because the top 10% of cited articles are excluded,
and thus the long tails that PIG is ideal for modeling no
longer exist. On the whole, as with the Maliniak et al. speci-
fications, PIG makes better intuitive and statistical sense to
use than NB regression.
The PIG model produces considerably different results
than the NB model for the `all female' predictor. I find
that `all female' is statistically significant for models 1­7,
10, 11, 14, and 15. Perhaps most interestingly, the coef-
ficient for `all female' is actually positive for models 14
and 15. Model 14 includes 2007 data and temporal and
geographic focus predictors, excludes years controls, ten-
ured female, and coed papers predictors, and additionally
trims the top 2% of non-coed citations. Model 15 is the
original `kitchen sink' model and trims the top 5% of
non-coed citations. The positive coefficient indicates that
women are cited more than men in IR when heavily cited
non-coed papers are excluded. Like Maliniak et al., the
replications of Zigerell's models suggest that conclusions
about the existence of a gender gap in IR citations is sen-
sitive to the data chosen and the construction of the
models.5
Conclusion
The replication results using Poisson inverse Gaussian
regression are inconclusive about the existence of a gender
gap in international relations citation patterns. Women are
certainly not always cited less than men and in some circum-
stances might be cited more than men. There is some evi-
dence that a gender gap may exist, but as mentioned above,
it appears considerably subject to the substantive choices
made on the data and predictors included in models.
While the main point of this comment is to illustrate the
use of the PIG model for social science count data, the anal-
ysis does not definitively settle what is the best model or
technique for analyzing IR citation data. To do so, we may
prefer an experimental or quasi-experimental design; some-
thing which the citation data cannot provide. As discussed
by Leamer (1983), the replications here serve as a form of
sensitivity analysis using a statistical technique that appears
to better fit the data-generating process.

1. Further, both approach a Poisson distribution as the overdis-
persion parameter becomes small.
2. The user-written Stata command for PIG is pigreg. All of
the replications in this paper are performed in Stata 13.1.
However, Hilbe (2014) also demonstrates the PIG model in
R with the gamlss package.

4. Zigerell (2015) includes an exceptionally clear Stata do-file
for the analysis.
5. The PIG effect size for all female also appears smaller, but
only in model 6, where all female is significant in both NB
and PIG, can one make a confident comparison.
