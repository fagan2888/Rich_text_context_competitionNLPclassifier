PURPOSE: To determine whether white, black and hispanic young (17 ± 39 y) and middle-aged (40 ± 59 y) adults, and
elderly (60 ± 90 y) Americans have the same values of abdominal adiposity (estimated from waist circumference (WC)
at the established levels of overweight (body mass index, BMI 25 ± 29.9 kgam2) and obesity (BMI ! 30 kgam2).
METHODS: Data (n  16,120) from the US Third National Health and Nutrition Survey were utilized. Age-adjusted
linear regression analyses were used to estimate gender- and ethnic-speci®c WC values corresponding to overweight
and obesity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also employed to determine the choices of WC
values corresponding to the established BMI cut-off points. With ROC, gender- and ethnic-speci®c cut-off points
producing the best combination of sensitivity and speci®city were selected as optimal thresholds for WC values
corresponding to the established BMI cut-off points.
RESULTS: WC values associated with the established BMI were lower in blacks and hispanics compared with whites.
In men, the WC values that corresponded to overweight ranged from 89 to 106 cm, from 84 to 95 cm, and from 87 to
97 cm in whites, blacks and hispanics, respectively. The corresponding values for obesity ranged from 99 to 110 cm,
from 96 to 107 cm, and from 97 to 108 cm. The WC values that corresponded to overweight in women ranged from 82
to 91 cm, from 81 in to 90 cm, and from 83 to 92 cm in whites, blacks and hispanics, respectively. The analogous values
for obesity ranged from 94 to 101 cm, from 93 to 100 cm, and from 94 to 101 cm.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of higher WC values in blacks (particularly women) and hispanics at the same levels of BMI
for whites challenges previously held assumptions regarding the role of abdominal adiposity in cardiovascular disease
experienced by non-whites. De®ning the anthropometric variables that satisfactorily describe reasons for ethnic
differences in cardiovascular disease is one of the challenges for future research.

Introduction
The most widely used anthropometric measure of total
and overall body adiposity is the body mass index
(BMI). BMI is a height-adjusted weight that is asso-
ciated with many cardiovascular diseases (CVD)
including stroke, non-insulin dependent (type 2) dia-
betes mellitus and hypertension.1 ± 3 High BMI has
also been shown to be associated with all-cause
mortality in different population groups.4,5 However,
many studies report that abdominal or central obesity,
which represents an aberrant fat accumulation, is
equally as important as BMI, and may be a more
potent adiposity phenotype and a better predictor for
CVD or mortality in some population groups.6,7
First described as gynoid and android body habitus
some 40 years ago,8 the mechanism of abdominal fat
distribution in CVD is not clear. Two possible
mechanisms have been suggested for the mode of
action of abdominal adiposity. First, through the
highly sensitive lipolytic and hypertrophied visceral
adipose tissues, elevated free fatty acids may induce
insulin resistance.9,10 Second, elevated free testoster-
one and reduced sex-hormone-binding globulin may
promote increased abdominal adiposity and reduce
fractional hepatic extraction of insulin.11 Thus, the
connection of adiposity with CVD may be due to
enlarged visceral fat depots discharging free fatty
acids into the portal and systemic circulation.9 ± 11
Adequate assessment of abdominal adiposity
requires imaging techniques, such as computed tomo-
graphy and magnetic resonance.12,13 Due to the high

costs and labor requirement, and possible risk of
radiation, imaging techniques are often limited to
laboratory settings. Hence, anthropometric surrogates
are commonly employed. Waist circumference (WC)
has been endorsed as the best anthropometric surro-
gate of abdominal adiposity.12,14 WC is an aggregate
measurement of the actual amount of total and abdom-
inal fat accumulation and is a crucial correlate of
abnormal metabolic syndromes found among obese
and overweight subjects.14,15 WC measurement is
simple, requires only a ¯exible tape and, with appro-
priate training, measurement error is low due to large
circumference. Indeed, many are now advocating
WC as a valid anthropometric variable for health
promotion and the basis for alerting those at risk of
CVD.16 ± 19
WC is highly correlated with visceral adipose tissue
accumulation.20 ± 22 Visceral adiposity is the compo-
nent of body composition that is most highly asso-
ciated with many metabolic abnormalities such as
hypertension, glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinemia,
hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and high
levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.1,23 ± 27
Despite numerous reports stating that the higher
risks of CVD in non-whites compared with whites
may be explained by their difference in adiposity
phenotypes, only little information is available on
the relationship between overall adiposity and abdom-
inal adiposity in white, black and hispanic Americans.
In this research, we took advantage of the third US
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) to examine whether these ethnic
groups have the same levels of abdominal fat accu-
mulation at the established BMI cut-off points for
overall body overweight and obesity. BMI of 25 ±
29.9 kgam2 (overweight) and ! 30 kgam2 (obesity)
have been endorsed my many international agencies
as the levels of adiposity for increased risk of obesity
related co-morbidities.19,28
Methods
Study population
NHANES III was a multistage probability sample of
non-institutionalized civilian US population groups
examined between 1988 and 1994. The sampling
and measurement procedures have been extensively
described elsewhere.29,30 Only subjects identi®ed as
non-hispanic white, non-hispanic black and hispanic
Americans aged 17 ± 90 y were eligible for this inves-
tigation. This study was also restricted to individuals
for whom anthropometric measurements were avail-
able, including weight, height, hip, and waist.
Anthropometric measurements
Weight was measured in the upright position using a
digital scale. Waist measurement was made to the
nearest 0.1 cm at midpoint between the bottom of the
rib cage and above the top of the iliac crest. Height
was measured in meters to the nearest 0.1 cm using a
stadiometer against a vertical wall with a rigid head-
board using an inelastic tape measure. A description
of measurement precision between technicians has
been given elsewhere.31 BMI was calculated as the
measured weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared (kgam2).
Statistical methods
Statistical programs available in SPSS32 (version 9.0)
and SIMSTAT33 (version 1.24) for Windows were
utilized for these analyses. Means and standard devia-
tions of age and anthropometric variables were com-
puted and compared within gender and across ethnic
group. Pearson's correlation analysis was utilized to
quantify the univariate relationship between BMI and
WC. The prevalence of abdominal adiposity was age-
adjusted by direct methods using the 1990 US popula-
tion census data. Linear regression analyses were
performed to determine gender- and ethnic-speci®c
WC values corresponding to BMI of 25 ± 29.9 kgam2
and ! 30 kgam2 in young (17 ± 39 y) and middle-aged
(40 ± 59 y) adults, and elderly (60 ± 90 y) Americans.
Further adjustment for age was made using gender
and ethnic speci®c median value of age. In the linear
regression, the full model was speci®ed as:
BMI  a0
 b1
age  b2
black  b3
hispanic
 b4
waist  b5
black Â waist
 b6
hispanic Â waist
where a is the intercept, and blackÂwaist and
hispanicÂwaist are interaction terms for black with
WC, and hispanic with WC, respectively, created
from dummy variables in which the WC values for
non-whites were compared with whites. Hence,
WC values corresponding to each established BMI
cut-points were calculated as:
WC value 
BMI À a0
À b1
age À b2
black À b3
hispanic
b4
waist  b5
black Â waist  b6
hispanic Â waist
Gender- and ethnic-speci®c receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curves were also evaluated to deter-
mine WC values corresponding to BMI cut-off
points.34,35 With the ROC technique, comparison of
sensitivity with the false-positive rate for BMI cut-off
point was made over the entire range of WC values.
WC value corresponding to an established BMI cut-
off point was determined by interpolation from the
point of intersect of the lines of speci®city and
sensitivity.34 The point of intersect between lines
of speci®city and sensitivity represent the highest
numbers of subjects with and without overweight or
obesity.

The areas under each curve (AUCs) were calculated
and bootstrapping procedures were used to estimate
the 95% con®dence intervals and to determine
whether ROC curves were similar across ethnic
groups.35 The plausible values of AUC range between
0 and 1. AUC values of 0.5, `0.5 and b0.5 represent
random, worse than random, and better than random,
respectively, while the value of 1 indicate a perfect
performance.35
Results
The anthropometric characteristics of the participants
are presented in Table 1. Overall, 16 120 subjects
(6772 non-hispanic whites, 4720 non-hispanic blacks
and 4628 hispanic Americans) were eligible for this
investigation. There were signi®cant ethnic differ-
ences for some variables, with whites tending to be
older than their black and hispanic men counterparts.
White men had greater waist girth than black and
hispanic men (P `0.01). Among women, blacks had
signi®cantly higher mean weight, BMI and WC values
than whites or hispanic counterparts (P `0.01).
Age-adjusted distribution of elevated WC by
gender and ethnicity is presented in Figure 1. Overall,
the prevalence of abdominal adiposity, de®ned as
WC ! 102 cm for men and ! 88 cm for women was
34.1%, 21.8% and 25.2% for white, black and hispa-
nic American men, respectively. The corresponding
values for white, black and hispanic American women
were 50%, 57.8% and 57.4%, respectively.
WC ! 102 cm for men and ! 88 cm for women have
recently been recommended by the National Institute
of Health (NIH) expert panels for identifying
increased relative risk for obesity co-morbidities.19
Age-adjusted Pearson's correlation analyses were
performed to determine the degree of linear associa-
tion of BMI with WC. BMI, as expected, very highly
correlated with waist girth in men and women
(r ! 0.87; all P `0.01). Among men, BMI was more
strongly correlated with WC in blacks (r  0.94) than
whites (r  0.88) and hispanics (r  0.87) BMI was
also more highly correlated with WC in black women
(r  0.92) compared with their white (r  0.89) and
hispanic (r  0.88) counterparts. The explained var-
iances obtained from linear regression models for the
prediction of WC from BMI were similar to the results
of correlation analyses. The overall explained var-
iances were high (r 2 ! 0.82) and tended to decrease
with age in the three ethnic groups (data not shown).
A similar stronger r 2 value for BMI with WC was also
observed in blacks than in whites or hispanics.
Linear regression-derived age-adjusted WC values
corresponding to the established BMI cut-off points
are shown in Table 2. Overall, with the exception of
young women, white men and white women had
consistently higher WC values at a given level of
overall adiposity than their black and hispanic coun-
terparts. Also, the estimated WC corresponding to
overweight and obesity tended to increase with age.
The model for men and women explained 87% and
83% of the variances in WC, respectively.
Table 2 summarizes the ®ndings of linear regres-
sion analyses of WC values corresponding to BMI of
25 ± 29.9 kgam2 and ! 30 kgam2 in young and
middle-aged adults, and elderly. In the young adult
men, WC values corresponding to BMI of 25 kgam2

ranged from 85 cm in blacks to 89 cm in whites. In the
middle-aged adult men, the WC values ranged from
88 cm in blacks to 92 cm in whites, while in the
elderly the values ranged from 92 cm in blacks to
106 cm in whites. The corresponding values for obe-
sity in young adult men ranged from 99 cm in blacks
to 103 cm in whites, from 103 cm in black to 106 cm
in whites middle-aged and from 107 cm in black to
110 cm in white elderly. Among women, WC values
corresponding to overweight ranged from 81 cm in
black to 83 cm in hispanic young adults. Among the
middle-aged adult women, the WC ranged from 83 cm
in blacks to 86 cm in whites, while in the elderly the
values ranged from 87 cm in blacks to 89 cm in
whites. The analogous values for obesity in young
adult women ranged from 93 cm in black to 96 cm in
whites, from 95 cm in blacks to 98 cm in middle-aged
whites and hispanics, and from 98 cm in black to
101 cm in elderly whites.
Table 3 presents the ®ndings of ROC analyses of
WC for BMI that jointly provided optimal sensitivity
and speci®city for overweight and obesity. In the
young adult men, WC values that maximized sensi-
tivity and speci®city for overweight ranged from
84 cm in blacks to 89 cm in whites. In the middle-
aged adult men, the WC values ranged from 91 cm in
blacks to 95 cm in whites, while in the elderly the
values ranged from 95 cm in blacks to 98 cm in
whites. The analogous values for obesity in young
adult men ranged from 96 cm in blacks to 99 cm in
whites, from 102 cm in black to 105 cm in white
middle-aged and from 103 cm in both black and
hispanic to 105 cm in white elderly. Among women,
WC values of 83 cm corresponded to overweight in
young adults of the three ethnic groups. Among the
middle-aged adult women, the WC ranged from 89 cm
in blacks and whites to 90 cm in the hispanics, while
in the elderly the values ranged from 90 cm in blacks
to 92 cm in hispanics. WC values of 94 and 97 cm
were respectively associated with obesity in young
and middle-aged adult women of the three ethnic
groups. In the elderly women, WC optimizing sensi-
tivity and speci®city for obesity ranged from 100 cm
in blacks and whites to 101 cm in the hispanics.
The overall performance of the ROC curves for the
established BMI cut-points was quanti®ed by comput-
ing gender- and age-speci®c AUCs (Table 4). Overall,
WC tended to perform better for obesity compared to
underweight in all ethnic groups. In all ethnic groups,
WC performed better than what was expected by
random chance in classifying subjects to their true
overall adiposity status (AUC b0.50). Also, WC
tended to perform better for the established BMI
cut-off points in young adults compared to middle-
aged adults and the elderly.
We combined men and women separately and
determined gender-speci®c WC values for overweight
and obesity. As shown in Table 5, WC values of 91
and 86 cm corresponded to overweight in men and
women, respectively, using linear regression models.

WC values of 103 and 97 cm corresponded to obesity
in men and women, respectively, using linear regres-
sion models. The corresponding values using ROC
techniques were 92 cm (sensitivity 85%, speci®city
86%) and 87 cm (sensitivity 87%, speci®city 86%) for
overweight, and 101 cm (sensitivity 90%, speci®city
85%) and 97 cm (sensitivity 86%, speci®city 88%) for
obesity in men and women, respectively.
Gender- and ethnic-speci®c ROC curves of WC for
obesity are shown in Figure 2. The ROC curves
visually represent the relationship between sensitivity
(true positive rate) and 1-speci®city (false-positive
rate) for each of the three ethnic groups over the
entire range of WC. Like the observed curves for
overweight (®gure not shown), the AUCs associated
with obesity in each ethnic group were signi®cantly
higher than what was expected by chance alone
(P `0.01). Overall there were no statistically signi®-
cant ethnic differences in the AUCs for males and for
females of the three groups, indicating that WC
performed reasonably well in identifying overweight
and obese subjects in the three groups.
Discussion
Although a large body of epidemiological data sug-
gests BMI to be as an important obesity phenotype in
CVD, many investigators think aberrant fat localiza-
tion, as seen in central or abdominal body regions,
may be equally as potent as BMI for CVD.12 ± 16,36 As
suggested by some investigators, blacks have higher
upper-body adiposity, based on subscapular skinfold
thickness and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) compared to
whites,36 hence blacks are more likely to have larger
visceral fat deposits.37 Some studies conclude that
blacks propensity to metabolic aberrations may be a
result of more excess visceral adiposity compared

with whites. Others have postulated that the propen-
sity for CVD among blacks may be due to the stronger
correlation between abdominal adiposity and visceral
adipose tissue in blacks than in whites.37
Many studies investigating the association between
metabolic abnormalities have used WHR as a surro-
gate measure of abdominal adiposity because of some
assertions that WHR show a more potent association
with CVD in some populations.38 Indeed, WHR is
associated with risk of CVD in several populations,
independent of BMI, where WC does not remain
independent. WC has been advocated in the guidelines
for overweight and obese individuals;19 thus, in this
group WHR would be a reasonable measure. Since
obese and non obese subjects can have same WHR, it
may re¯ect the fact that WHR can capture relative fat
distribution more independently of BMI or total
obesity. However, in this analysis we chose to use
only WC to assess abdominal adiposity because of the
inherent weakness of WHR as a ratio index,39,40 and
because it is strongly in¯uenced by pelvic structure.41
Consistent with previous ®ndings, the results of this
investigation showed BMI to be more strongly corre-
lated with WC in blacks than whites and hispanics.37
Despite black men having similar mean weight and
BMI as white men, and black women having signi®-
cantly higher mean values of weight and BMI com-
pared with white women, black men and black women
were found to have lower WC values at given levels
of overweight and obesity. hispanic men and women
were also found to have signi®cantly lower WC
values than their white counterparts at the given
BMI of 25 ± 29.9 kgam2 and ! 30 kgam2. Our ®nding
in relation to small WC girth in blacks is consistent
with studies by Conway et al,37 Albu et al 42 and
Dowling and Pi-Sunyer,43 who also found blacks to
have less visceral adipose tissues than whites at
similar BMI values: our result is also consistent with
studies by Stevens et al,44 who found the ratio of
abdomen to midarm circumference was larger in
white women than black women.
In a study by Lean et al,18 WC ! 94 cm for men
and ! 80 cm for women were found to correspond to
a BMI of 25 kgam2 or more, while WC ! 102 cm for
men and ! 88 cm for women were found to corre-
spond to a BMI of 30 kgam2 or greater. Although it is
generally known that for a given waist girth, there is
selective accumulation of visceral tissue with age,
Lean et al 18 did not consider age in the determination
of WC values corresponding to obesity. In addition,
Lean et al 45 included the criterion of high WHR
(WHR b0.95 in men and b0.85 in women) to esti-
mate WC values corresponding to these BMI cut-off
points. Indeed, these WC values were designed for
health promotion to give optimal enrichment to indi-
viduals in need of weight management because of
overweightaobesity or because of central fat distribu-
tion. It is therefore not surprising that the WC values
from our study are different. The studies by Lean and
colleagues18 were also restricted to white populations
from The Netherlands and Canada, and generaliza-
bility of the results is highly controversial.
The data presented for this analysis have the
advantage of being large and national in scope,
making the results more generalizable to the overall
US population. The training program and quality
control measures instituted in NHANES III give an
added credence to the data. The observed differences
in WC values corresponding to the established BMI
cut-points in this study between regression and ROC
methods were not surprising. With the regression
method, WC is assumed to be a linear function of
BMI, where as ROC procedures are based on the best
combination of sensitivity and speci®city.
Our results showed that the regression and ROC
models ®tted the data reasonably well, as indicated by
r 2 ! 82%, and sensitivity and speci®city ! 83%,
respectively. However, the decision on what cut-off
points to use must not be based on model performance
alone. Other additional factors, such as the overall
impact on health due to intervention (eg weight
reduction), potential burden on health services if a
low cut-off point is employed, and the bene®t of
alerting people developing a weight problem, must
be considered in determining what WC value to
recommend.
Conclusion
In summary, the lack of higher values of WC at
similar BMI cut-off points in non-whites compared
with whites de®es previously held notions regarding
the role of abdominal adiposity in CVD experienced
by non-whites. Future research should include deter-
mining whether other anomalous fat distributions
or patterning are more relevant to ethnic differences
in CVD beyond those that are provided by tradition-
ally used anthropometic variables such as BMI and
WC.
