Does Exercise Reduce Inflammation?
Physical Activity and C-Reactive Protein
Among U.S. Adults
Earl S. Ford
Background. Physical activity may lower the risk for coronary
heart disease by mitigating inflammation, which plays a key
role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The purpose of
this study was to examine the association between physical
activity and C-reactive protein concentration in a national
sample of the U.S. population.
Methods. The analytic sample included 13,748 participants
20 years of age in the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey III (1988­1994) with complete data for the
main study variables.
Results. After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education,
work status, smoking status, cotinine concentration, hyperten-
sion, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol concentration, and aspirin use, the odds ratios
for elevated C-reactive protein concentration (dichotomized
at the 85th percentile of the sex-specific distribution) were
0.98 (95% confidence interval  0.78­1.23), 0.85 (0.70­
1.02), and 0.53 (0.40­0.71) for participants who engaged in
light, moderate, and vigorous physical activity, respectively,
during the previous month compared with participants who
did not engage in any leisure-time physical activity. In addi-
tion, leisure-time physical activity was positively associated
with serum albumin concentration and inversely associated
with both log-transformed plasma fibrinogen concentration
and log-transformed white blood cell count.
Conclusions. These results add to mounting evidence that
physical activity may reduce inflammation, which is a critical
process in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.

Key words: adults, C-reactive protein, exercise, health surveys, inflammation.
Physical activity helps protect against numerous
chronic diseases.1 Twenty-five percent of adults in
the United States are sedentary, and more than
60% are not regularly active.1 During the past decade,
little change has occurred in the proportion of adults in
the United States who are meeting current physical
activity recommendations.2 One estimate of the direct
health care delivery costs of physical inactivity is $24
billion.3
The evidence showing the benefits of physical activ-
ity for cardiovascular disease is overwhelming.4 There
are several plausible biological mechanisms to explain
this relation. Physical activity is inversely linked to
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration,
blood pressure, body mass index, glucose intolerance,
and fibrinolytic activity, all risk factors for cardiovascu-
lar disease. Furthermore, physical activity promotes the
hemodynamic functioning of the heart. In addition,
people who are physically active often have other be-
haviors associated with a decreased risk for cardiovascu-
lar disease, such as lower rates of smoking and higher
rates of fruit and vegetable consumption.
Inflammation is of critical importance in the patho-
genesis of cardiovascular disease.5 Thus, it is of consid-
erable interest to know whether physical activity can
affect the inflammatory process. Several studies have
shown inverse associations between physical activity
levels and concentrations of acute phase reactants such
as fibrinogen and C-reactive protein.6­14
Because previous studies of physical activity and C-
reactive protein concentrations have been limited to
special populations, I explored this relation in a repre-
sentative sample of the U.S. population. Furthermore,
previous studies may not have adequately controlled for

is on the association between leisure-time physical ac-
tivity and C-reactive protein concentration, I also ana-
lyzed the associations between leisure-time physical ac-
tivity and fibrinogen (a positive acute phase reactant),
white blood cell count, and albumin (a negative acute
phase reactant).
Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III) was conducted between
1988 and 1994. A representative sample of the nonin-
stitutionalized civilian U.S. population, selected by us-
ing a multistage, stratified sampling design, was inter-
viewed and invited for a clinical examination. For most
participants, blood was drawn at the examination clinic,
but for some who were unable to attend the examination
because of health reasons, a blood sample was obtained
during the home interview. Persons age 60 years, Af-
rican Americans, and Mexican Americans were over-
sampled. Details about the survey and its methods have
been previously published.15,16
Participants attended one of three examination ses-
sions: morning, afternoon, or evening. Those attending
the morning sessions were asked to fast for 10­16 hours
before the session; those attending the afternoon and
evening sessions were asked to fast for at least 6 hours.
C-reactive protein was measured at the University of
Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine by us-
ing latex-enhanced nephelometry.16 The lower detec-
tion limit was 3.0 mg/L. An elevated C-reactive protein
concentration was defined as one at or above the 85th
percentile of the sex-specific distribution: 4.4 mg/dL
for men and 7.0 mg/dL for women.17 Albumin was
measured on a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel analyzer
after binding with bromcresol purple (Boehringer Mann-
heim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Fibrinogen concen-
tration was determined by comparing the clotting time
from a sample with that of a standardized fibrinogen
preparation obtained on a Coagamate XC Plus auto-
mated coagulation analyzer (Organon Teknika,
Durham, NC). White blood cell count was determined
on a Coulter Counter Model S-PLUS JR (Coulter Elec-
tronics, Hialeah, FL). Details about these laboratory
procedures and quality control have been published.16
Respondents were asked whether they participated
and, if so, their frequency of participation in the follow-
ing activities during the previous month: walking, jog-
ging or running, bicycling or bicycling on an exercise
bicycle, swimming, aerobics or aerobic dancing, other
dancing, calisthenics or exercises, gardening or yard
work, and lifting weights. Participants could also report
up to four additional physical activities. Four levels of
physical activity were defined: vigorously active, moder-
ately active, lightly active, and sedentary. "Vigorously
active" was defined as participating three or more times
per week in an activity with a metabolic equivalent
(MET) level of 6 for participants who were 60 years or
older and 7 for participants who were younger than 60
years. One MET is the energy expenditure of approxi-
mately 3.5 ml oxygen per kg body weight per minute or
1 kcal per kg body weight per hour. "Moderately active"
was defined as participating five or more times per week
in activities of which no more than two could be con-
sidered vigorous activities. "Lightly active" was defined
as participation that was not vigorous or moderate. Sed-
entary was defined as engaging in no leisure-time phys-
ical activity. In addition, a summary measure of physical
activity was created by summing the products of the
frequency of participation by the MET levels for each
reported activity.
The analyses for this paper included the following vari-
ables: age, sex, ethnicity, education, working status, smok-
ing status, serum cotinine concentration, hypertension,
body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, total cholesterol con-
centration, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concen-
tration, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride
concentration, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B, li-
poprotein(a), uric acid, aspirin use, alcohol consumption,
and fruit and vegetable intake. Most of these variables were
selected based on published findings suggesting relations
with C-reactive protein concentrations.10,17­22
Participants who answered the question "During the
past 2 weeks, did you work at any time at a job or
business, not counting work around the house?" in the
affirmative were determined to have worked during that
time period. Serum cotinine concentration was deter-
mined by using high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization tandem
mass spectrometry. Three levels of smoking status were
created: participants who currently smoked (had smoked
100 cigarettes and were currently smoking), those who
had quit smoking (had smoked 100 cigarettes and were
not currently smoking), and those who had never
smoked (had never smoked 100 cigarettes). Three blood
pressure readings were obtained in the mobile examina-
tion center. The average of the second and third blood
pressure readings (both systolic and diastolic) was used
in the analyses. Hypertension was defined as a systolic
blood pressure 140 mmHg, a diastolic blood pressure
90 mmHg, or the current use of antihypertensive
medication.
Concentrations of total cholesterol, high-density li-
poprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides (after hydrolyza-
tion to glycerol) were measured enzymatically on a Hi-
tachi 704 Analyzer. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol
was measured after the precipitation of other lipopro-
teins with a heparin-manganese chloride mixture. Low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol was calculated using the

Friedewald equation for participants who reported fast-
ing at least 9 hours,23 were examined in the morning,
and were randomly assigned to the morning fasting sam-
ple. Apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured only for
participants from Phase 1 (1988­1991) of NHANES III.
These apolipoproteins were measured by using nephe-
lometry on a Beckman Nephelometer Automated Array
(Beckman Instrument, Inc, Brea, CA). Lipoprotein(a)
concentration was measured only for participants from
Phase 2 (1991­1994) of NHANES III and was measured
by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Stra-
tegic Diagnostics, Newark, DE). Uric acid was measured
on a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel analyzer after
oxidation by uricase to form allantoin and H2
O2
(Boeh-
ringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Details
about the laboratory procedures of all these tests are
found elsewhere.16
Body mass index was calculated from measured
weight and height (weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared). The circumferences of the
waist (at the level of the right iliac crest) and hips (at
the maximum extension of the buttocks) were measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm. Aspirin use was estimated from
the following question: "In the past month, have you
taken any aspirin, Anacin, Bufferin, Ecotrin, Ascriptin,
or Midol?" Participants were then asked how often they
used these products in the previous month. Consump-
tion of beer, wine, or hard liquor during the past month,
determined from a food-frequency questionnaire, was
used to estimate alcohol consumption. Fruit and vege-
table intake was determined by summing the responses
to 21 items on a food-frequency questionnaire.
Because C-reactive protein concentrations are ele-
vated in numerous diseases, I examined whether coro-
nary heart disease (self-reported myocardial infarction,
or probable or possible myocardial infarction diagnosed
by electrocardiogram), cancer other than skin cancer
(self-reported), diabetes (self-reported or based on fast-
ing blood glucose concentration), arthritis (self-report-
ed), or asthma (self-reported) possibly confounded the
association between leisure-time physical activity and
C-reactive protein concentration. Electrocardiograms
were only offered to participants 40 years of age.
Analyses were limited to participants 20 years of
age. Age-adjustment was based the 1980 U.S. popula-
tion 20 years of age using the direct method. Tests for
linear trend were carried out for proportions and means
across levels of physical activity. In addition, I examined
the associations between the dichotomized C-reactive
protein concentrations and the independent variables by
using logistic regression analysis. P-values for linear
trend were calculated by using the medians of the fre-
quency-MET variable for each level of the four-level
leisure-time physical activity variable. Age, sex, race or
ethnicity, and education were included in all multiple-
adjusted logistic regression models. In addition, variables
that were substantially related to both leisure-time phys-
ical activity and C-reactive protein concentration (Ta-
bles 1 and 2) were initially included in the regression
models. Subsequently, variables that were not substan-
tially associated with leisure-time physical activity were
removed from the models, as long as their removal did
not seriously change the odds ratios (ORs). I explored
the associations between leisure-time physical activity
and albumin concentration, fibrinogen concentration,
and white blood cell count using both linear regression
and logistic regression analyses. The same set of covari-
ates identified for the logistic regression model for lei-
sure-time physical activity and C-reactive protein con-
centration was used in these models. After inspecting
the distributions of these variables, I performed addi-
tional linear regression models with log-transformations
of fibrinogen and white blood cell count to improve
their distributional properties. In addition, the associa-
tions between leisure-time physical activity and these
variables were examined by using logistic regression
analysis. To be consistent with the logistic regression
model for C-reactive protein concentration, I dichoto-
mized albumin concentration, fibrinogen concentration,
and white blood cell count using the 85th percentile of
their weighted distributions as the cutpoint. Because the
85th percentiles of these variables were very similar for
men and women--unlike those for C-reactive protein
concentration--I did not use sex-specific cutpoints. To
account for the complex survey design, analyses were
conducted with SUDAAN.24 I used the medical exam-
ination clinic sampling weights to produce weighted
estimates.
Results
Of the 16,573 participants age 20 years who at-
tended the medical examination, C-reactive protein was
determined for 15,604. After participants with missing
data for the study variables were excluded, this analysis
was based on 13,748 participants age 20 years. C-
reactive protein concentrations ranged from 3.0 mg/L
to 252.0 mg/L (3.0 mg/L to 198.0 mg/L for men and
3.0 mg/L to 252.0 mg/L for women). About three-
quarters of the men (78%) and two-thirds of the women
(66%) had a value of 3.0 mg/L.
Physical activity levels were inversely related to age,
the proportion of participants who had worked during
the past 2 weeks, the percentage of current smokers,
serum cotinine concentration, the percentage of partic-
ipants with hypertension, body mass index and waist-
to-hip ratio, total cholesterol concentration, non­
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration,
triglyceride concentration, and apolipoprotein B con-
centration (Table 1). Furthermore, leisure-time physical

activity was directly related to the proportion of men,
the proportion of white participants, years of education,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration, al-
cohol consumption, and fruit and vegetable intake. Sed-
entary participants had the lowest prevalence of aspirin
use during the previous month.
After age adjustment, 8% of vigorously active partic-
ipants, 13% of moderately active participants, 17% of
lightly active participants, and 21% of sedentary partic-
ipants had an elevated C-reactive protein concentration
(P for linear trend 0.001) (Table 1). In addition,
leisure-time physical activity was positively associated
with serum albumin concentration (P for linear trend
0.001), and inversely associated with white blood cell
count (P for linear trend 0.001) and plasma fibrinogen
concentration (P for linear trend 0.001).
Participants with an elevated C-reactive protein con-
centration differed from participants with a low C-reactive
protein concentration for all variables except total choles-
terol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations (Table 2).
After adjusting for age, the ORs for having an elevated
C-reactive protein concentration were 0.78 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI]  0.64­0.96), 0.59 (0.49­0.70), and
0.30 (0.22­0.41) for lightly active participants, moderately
active participants, and vigorously active participants, re-
spectively, compared with sedentary participants. To ex-
amine whether this association was independent of covari-
ates other than age, I used logistic regression analysis to
adjust for potential confounders. Non­high-density li-
poprotein cholesterol concentration, alcohol consumption,
and fruit and vegetable consumption were removed one at
a time from the logistic model, and odds ratios remained
virtually unchanged. With sedentary participants serving as
the reference group, odds ratios were 0.98 (CI  0.78­
1.23) for lightly active participants, 0.85 (0.70­1.02) for
moderately active participants, and 0.53 (0.40­0.71)
for vigorously active participants (Table 3). Results for the
full logistic regression model for C-reactive protein are
presented in Table 4. In a separate analysis of participants
who reported fasting 8 hours, triglyceride concentration

was only modestly associated with leisure-time physical
activity (per mmol/L  0.05092, SE  0.04827).
To explore possible confounding by chronic disease, I
reran a logistic regression model after adding the follow-
ing self-reported conditions: heart attack, cancer other
than skin cancer, diabetes, asthma, and arthritis. The
odds ratios changed little: 0.98 (CI 
0.79­1.23), 0.86 (0.71­1.04), and
0.53 (0.40­0.71) for light, moderate,
and vigorous leisure-time physical ac-
tivity, respectively.
In another analysis limited to 8435
persons who reported fasting at least 8
hours, C-reactive protein concentra-
tion remained inversely associated
with physical activity after additional
adjustment for serum insulin concen-
tration. Compared with sedentary par-
ticipants, odds ratios were 0.92 for par-
ticipants who were lightly active, 0.85
for participants who were moderately
active, and 0.54 for participants who
were vigorously active. Fasting insulin
was positively associated with C-reac-
tive protein status (per pmol/L 
0.00231, SE  0.00076).
Leisure-time physical activity was
positively associated with albumin con-
centration and inversely associated with
log-transformed fibrinogen concentra-
tion and log-transformed white blood
cell counts in linear regression models.
In these logistic regression models, in
which the inflammatory markers were
dichotomized using the 85th percentile
of the distribution for men and women
combined, participants who were en-
gaged in vigorous leisure-time physical
activity were more likely to have had an
elevated albumin concentration (OR 
1.54, CI  1.10­2.16) and less likely to have had an
elevated fibrinogen concentration (OR  0.43, CI 
0.26­0.70) and an elevated white blood cell count (OR 
0.64, CI  0.41­0.99) compared with participants who did
not engage in leisure-time physical activity (Table 3). Lin-
ear trends were observed for the associations of leisure-time

Discussion
In a representative sample of adults in the United
States, leisure-time physical activity was inversely asso-
ciated with C-reactive protein concentration in a dose-
response manner. Leisure-time physical activity was also
directly associated with serum albumin concentration
and inversely with fibrinogen concentration and white
blood cell count. Thus, the results from this study sup-
port findings from other studies that physical activity
favorably affects concentrations of acute phase reac-
tants.6­14 Because this was a cross-sectional study, cause
and effect cannot be directly determined.
Previous cross-sectional studies with large sample
sizes have generally found an inverse association be-
tween physical activity and C-reactive protein con-
centration. Among 936 men 45­64 years of age who
were part of the Monitoring Trends and Determinants
in Cardiovascular Disease Augsburg Cohort Study,
C-reactive protein concentration
was inversely associated with leisure-
time physical activity during winter
and summer but was directly associ-
ated with work activity.9 Among 880
men and women age 70­79 years,
moderate and strenuous physical ac-
tivity were inversely associated with
C-reactive protein concentrations.13
Similar findings emerged from a
cross-sectional analysis of 5888 par-
ticipants, age 65 years, in the Car-
diovascular Health Study.14 In a
study of 1172 male physicians age
40­84 years, exercise frequency was
found to be inversely associated with
C-reactive protein concentration by
univariate but not multivariate
analysis.10
Interestingly, heavy bouts of exer-
cise result in short-lived inflamma-
tion.25­31 The etiology of this inflam-
mation differs from inflammation that
accompanies atherosclerosis or other
chronic conditions. The effect of sin-
gle bouts of exercise may have mixed
effects on acute phase reactants, how-
ever. For example, subjects who took a
30-minute treadmill test had increased
concentrations of alpha1-antitrypsin
and haptoglobin but not C-reactive
protein or alpha1-acid glycoprotein.32
It is not clear how physical activity
could influence the specific inflammatory activity asso-
ciated with cardiovascular disease or other diseases. C-
reactive protein is produced by hepatocytes. The major
stimulants of production are interleukin-6 (IL-6) and, to
a lesser degree, IL-1. Many stimuli can result in C-reac-
tive protein production and elevations in its blood con-
centrations. One such stimulus is the increased IL-6
production by adipocytes as body mass index increases.
By reducing adipose mass, physical activity could de-
crease IL-6 production and hence, C-reactive protein
production. However, after adjusting for body mass in-
dex and waist-to-hip ratio, C-reactive protein concen-
tration was still strongly related to level of physical
activity in the present study, suggesting that physical
activity influences the inflammatory process through
other mechanisms. Geffken and colleagues14 suggest that
physical activity can reduce inflammation by improving
insulin resistance because concentrations of several in-
flammatory markers were raised in insulin-resistant sub-
jects. However, after adjustment of NHANES III par-
ticipants' fasting insulin concentration, which is often
used as a measure of insulin resistance, the odds ratios

changed little, suggesting that physical activity influ-
ences the inflammatory process through other mecha-
nisms. Physical activity has been shown to improve
endothelial function.33 Endothelial cells are known to
secrete IL-1 and IL-6,34,35 inducers of an acute phase
response. Activated endothelial cells can increase pro-
duction of interleukins.36 The possibility remains that
the adjustments for excess weight were incomplete and
that residual confounding could still be present.
In conclusion, the results of this study showed that
physical activity is inversely associated with C-reactive
protein concentrations, suggesting that physical activity
may mitigate inflammation. Research to delineate the
exact mechanisms through which physical activity in-
fluences the inflammatory process will help improve our
understanding of some of the benefits of physical activ-
ity. Furthermore, additional research concerning the re-
lation of the intensity, duration, and type of physical
activity with inflammation could yield additional in-
sights into how physical activity might influence
inflammation.
