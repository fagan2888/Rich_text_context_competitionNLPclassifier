Abstract
Optical blur from defocus is quite frequently considered as equivalent to low-pass filtering. Yet that
belief, although not entirely wrong, is inaccurate. Here, we wish to disentangle the concepts of
dioptric blur, caused by myopia or mis-accommodation, from blur due to low-pass filtering when
convolving with a Gaussian kernel. Perhaps surprisingly--if well known in optometry--the
representation of a blur kernel (or point-spread function) for dioptric blur is, to a good
approximation and disregarding diffraction, simply a cylinder. Its projection onto the retina is
classically referred to as a blur circle, the diameter of which can easily be deduced from a light-
ray model. We further give the derivation of the relationship between the blur-disk's diameter and
the extent of blur in diopters, as well as the diameter's relation to the near or far point, and finally
its relationship to visual acuity.

Introduction
A while ago we were wondering whether the low signal amplitudes in fMRI retinotopic
mapping and visual evoked potential (VEP) recording from a psychiatric patient could be
due simply to a severe lack of correct optical accommodation. Blur reduces retinal contrast
(at higher spatial frequencies), which, in turn, should decrease evoked signal amplitude (in
VEPs: Strasburger, Murray, & Remky, 1993; Strasburger, Scheidler, & Rentschler, 1988; in
fMRI: Boynton, Demb, Glover, & Heeger, 1999). Yet a direct test would be more meaningful.

And since inserting plus lenses in our fMRI stimulus goggles would also blur any fixation mark
and thus impede fixation, the question arose what the appropriate kernel for digital blurring of
the stimulus images would be.
Optical blur from defocus is often considered as equivalent to low-pass filtering (e.g.,
McAnany, Alexander, Lim, & Shahidi, 2011; Meinecke & Kehrer, 2007; Petrova, Z
 anete,
Cikmac
 s, & Kassaliete, 2017; Wood, 1983). Yet that belief, although not entirely wrong, is
inaccurate. So, here in this short, tutorial-like note we wish to disentangle dioptric blur,
caused by myopia or mis-accommodation, from blur by low-pass filtering including
convolution with a Gaussian kernel. Perhaps surprisingly--if well known in
optometry--the blur kernel (or point-spread function [PSF]) for dioptric blur is (to a good
approximation and disregarding diffraction) simply a cylindrical disk. Its projection onto the
retina is classically referred to as a blur circle (see Figure 2(a) which is discussed later), the
diameter of which can be easily deduced from a light-ray model. The derivation is given later,
where we further derive the relationship between the blur-disk's diameter and the extent of
blur in diopters, and the diameter's relation to the near or the far point. Finally, we explore
the relationship of defocus to visual acuity based on an empirical approach by Blendowske
(2015). Note from the outset that we only consider defocus here, not blur in general. The
actual PSF is a superposition of the PSF from defocus with the PSFs from diffraction,
astigmatism, higher order aberrations--which all depend on pupil diameter--and the
idealized, needle-like PSF. It looks, in particular at low levels of mis-accommodation, very
different from a cylinder. Examples, for 200 eyes, are shown in Watson (2015, p. 15), based
on Thibos, Hong, Bradley, and Cheng (2002).
The role of the blur disk for blur, myopia, and accommodation has long been known.
Jurin (1738) uses it in his Essay on distinct and indistinct vision when he describes ways to
degrade the retinal image, from perfectly distinct (meaning perfectly in focus) to imperfectly
distinct, meaning somewhat out of focus but perceptually still appearing as distinct. One of
the methods used by Jurin was simply to bring the stimulus closer to the eye than
accommodation would allow, such that the retinal image is out of focus.1 Figure 1 is an
example from Jurin's essay where the observer looks at a ring stimulus, fixating a point (c) on
the ring's outer circumference. The pencil of rays emanating from that point will be dissipated
into a circle of dissipation (Jurin's term for the blur disk), drawn, in the figure, into the
stimulus (Jurin, 1738; Figure 2; here Figure 1).2 Jurin performs calculations with the radius
of dissipation; he argues, for example, that the penumbra in a certain example has twice the
thickness of the radius, and he describes how to measure the radius on that basis
Figure 1. (a) Example of a circle of dissipation from insufficient accommodation in Jurin (1738, Figure 2).
The circle, with center c, originates at the border of a ring stimulus with center C. (b) Jurin was aware of the
eye's basic anatomy, as shown by his sketch of the eye (Jurin, 1738, Figure 51).

perceptually.3,4 He does not actually derive the size of the radius, however, even though he is
aware of the role of the pupil size and lens curvature. Jurin had a good understanding of the
eye's anatomy and optics (Figure 1(b); cf. Strasburger & Wade, 2015; Wade, 2004).
To set dioptric blur apart from other kinds of blur, Figure 2 shows several types of a PSF5
that underlie various kinds of blur. The cylindrical PSF in Figure 2(a) is a simplified version
of what happens optically; the exponential in Figure 2(b) is an illustration of a two-
dimensional (2D) low-pass analog to the simplest low-pass filter in the time domain (it has
no natural counterpart in 2D); and the Gaussian in Figure 2(c) is typically used for modeling
low-pass filtering in the neural pathway, or, respectively, a difference of Gaussians for
bandpass filtering (Daugman, 1980; Malik & Perona, 1990; Rose, 1979).
Spurious Resolution
The importance of choosing the proper type of blur becomes obvious when considering
spurious resolution. This is a phenomenon long known in optical instrumentation
(Hotchkiss, Washer, & Rosberry, 1951; Smith, 1982b); it may be illustrated by applying
dioptric blur to a frequency sweep pattern, like the one in Figure 3(a), where spatial
frequency increases from left to right. For a given defocus, grating contrast first decreases
with increasing spatial frequency (as expected) reaching zero contrast at a certain spatial
frequency (Figure 3(b)). With spatial frequency increasing further, however, the grating
becomes visible again albeit with inverted phase. This is followed by another zero-crossing
of contrast, followed by another spatial frequency interval with nonzero contrast and the
original phase preserved. Such alternation of reversed and preserved phase continues up to
the cut-off frequency of the optical system. Consequently, high spatial frequencies are
detectable under dioptric blur, both psychophysically and when used as a stimulus for
objective acuity testing (Bach, Waltenspiel, & Schildwa
¨ chter, 1989; Heinrich, Lu
¨ th, &
Bach, 2015; Smith, 1982b). This is the case even when the PSF is much wider than the
period of the grating. High-acuity results, obtained with periodic patterns like sine-wave
gratings, must thus not be taken at face value. Gaussian blur, in contrast, cannot evoke
spurious resolution because the Fourier transform of a Gaussian remains a Gaussian and
is always positive.
Dioptric blur is not unique in its ability to induce spurious resolution (Harding, 1977;
Koenderink, 1984); Gaussian blur, however, is unique in avoiding spurious resolution
(Koenderink, 1984). It is also obvious that the effect is not limited to gratings as in
Figure 2. Various point-spread functions (PSFs) that lead to blur. (a) Slightly simplified PSF for defocus
resulting from inaccurate accommodation or myopia. Note that the actual PSF on the retina is a superposition
of that with influences from other factors. (b) PSF for a 2D low-pass filter in analogy to a first-order time-
domain low pass. (c) A Gaussian PSF.

Figure 3(a), and related phenomena even occur with nonperiodic stimulus types, such as
optotypes (Figure 4; see also Thorn & Schwartz, 1990; Wolf & Angerstein, 1978). The likely
difference, however, between the effect on gratings (measuring resolution acuity) and the
effect on optotypes (measuring recognition acuity; Heinrich & Bach, 2013; Strasburger &
Rentschler, 1996) appears to be that, while the orientation of the grating can still be judged
under the regimen of spurious resolution, the observer cannot make sense of the patchy
image of the optotype that results from the phase shifts associated with spurious
resolution (Bach et al., 1989; cf. Yellott & Yellott, 2007). However, there may be enough
information left in the dioptrically blurred letter stimuli to allow for differentiation between
letters after sufficient practice (Heinrich, Kru
¨ ger, & Bach, 2011). The role of spurious
resolution in reading is not yet clear (Chung, Jarvis, & Cheung, 2007). To avoid spurious
resolution, artificial pupils with Gaussian aperture have been proposed (Fry, 1953).
The above points illustrate that the choice of the proper blur kernel is of practical relevance
when dioptric blur-related vision impairments are considered. The considerable qualitative
difference between blur obtained with different blur kernels, as illustrated in Figure 4, also
demonstrates the limitations of those approaches that attempt to combine multiple sources of
blur into one equivalent Gaussian blur kernel (e.g., Coppens & van den Berg, 2004).
More generally, different visual impairments are associated with different kinds of image
degradation. Myopia is closely related to dioptric blur. Cataract, on the other hand, involves

contrast transfer factor as used here is not directly related to the contrast transfer function, which is
commonly defined for square wave gratings (Boreman, 2001).

den Berg, & de Jong, 1992; Elliott, Bullimore, Patla, & Whitaker, 1996). Amblyopic vision,
although appearing blurred to the subject, is not validly simulated by blur kernels altogether,
as it appears to be associated with perceptual distortions and image fragmentation (Piano, Bex,
& Simmers, 2015; Sireteanu, Ba
¨ umer, Sa
^ rbu, & Iftime, 2007; Sireteanu, Lagre
` ze, &
Constantinescu, 1993). This is the likely reason why there is a dissociation in amblyopia
between optotype acuity and grating acuity (or pattern acuity), both as measured
psychophysically (Bach, Strahl, Waltenspiel, & Kommerell, 1990; Friendly, Jaafar, & Morillo,
1990; Gwiazda, 1992; Kushner, Lucchese, & Morton, 1995) or in objective acuity tests based on
pattern VEPs (Heinrich, Bock, & Bach, 2016; Wenner, Heinrich, Beisse, Fuchs, & Bach, 2014).

Figure 4. Effect of blur on Sloan letters. Top row: original, unblurred letters, together with point-spread-
function profiles (right) for the lower rows. FWHMs of the three PSFs are equal. Note that PSF amplitudes
are necessarily different since their volume needs to be normalized to unity (light is neither added nor lost).
Second row: letters with dioptric blur simulated by using a disk with a diameter equal to the letter height as
blur kernel. The effect of spurious resolution is so strong that the blurred letters look quite unlike their
original. Third row: PSF with exponential drop-off (analogous to a first-order low-pass filter). Energy is spread
over a wide spatial range, such that amplitude is rather low. Bottom row: letters with simulated Gaussian blur.
For display, blurred images were increased in contrast to enhance the visibility of structures. Isolumes for all
three patterns represent luminance steps of 7 percentage points (white ¼ 100%). The gray scale
representation of the PSF in the right column uses a different scale than the blurred images.

Returning to dioptric blur, is a geometrical approximation of the dioptric PSF sufficient or
is a wave-optics approach required? As Yellott and Yellott (2007) illustrate, the answer to
that depends, to a large degree, on the relative effects of defocus and diffraction, with the
latter being related to pupil size. Various higher order aberrations (see, for instance,
Schaeffel, 2006) and the Stiles-Crawford effect (Stiles & Crawford, 1933) may also come
into play. However, as Artal (2014) points out, in eyes with normal optics, the amount of
higher order aberrations and visual acuity are not related; it may even be that the normal
pattern of aberrations provides the best performance (Artal et al., 2004). Defocus is further
the main source of degradation in the retinal images in most persons; the relative impact of
aberrations on image quality is comparable only for amounts of defocus below 0.25 D (Artal,
2014, pp. 351­352). Thus higher order aberrations are not pursued here.
Equations that relate the blur-disk diameter to defocus like the one given below have been
derived or cited earlier (Smith, 1982a, Equations (10) and (15); Dehnert, Bach, & Heinrich,
2011; Jacobs, Smith, & Chan, 1989; Ravikumar, Sarver, & Applegate, 2012; Smith, 1991). In
Figure 5, we present an intuitive approach, slightly different to that in, for example, Smith,
1982a6 or Atchison and Smith (2000).
Blur-Disk Diameter and Pupil Diameter
Unlike the case for the Gaussian, the dioptric blur-disk's diameter is reasonably well defined
since the luminance-times-blur-disk volume is (approximately) cylindrical (Figure 2(a)).
Under a few simplifying assumptions its diameter depends--in a surprisingly
straightforward way--on defocus and pupil diameter: The blur-disk diameter b, in
degrees of visual angle, is (as will be derived later) given by
b ¼

where pmm
is the pupil diameter in mm, and D is defocus in diopters (D). The equation allows
straightforward calculation of the blur kernel. This is well known (Atchison & Smith, 2000,
pp. 82­84; Smith, 1982a), but here is a simplified derivation for convenience:
Figure 5 shows the enveloping rays from a far-away point source in a myopic eye, that is,
an eye in which the focus lies before the retina (by a distance df ). Disregarding the differences
in the optic media within the eye and with a few further definitions--

For converting the linear blur-disk diameter b on the retina from meters to visual angle in
radians, note that the angular size is to be taken from the eye's back nodal point (N in the
figure and blue dashed lines), whose distance from the retina is dN
¼ 16.68 mm (Le Grand,
1968, p. 49). The value of (fþdf), on the other hand, is measured from the back principal
point (P) which is at a distance of dP
¼ 22.29 mm from the retina. The ratio of these two
values is the refractive index, n ¼ 1.336 (also Le Grand, 1968, p. 49):

and Equation (2a), we arrive at

This is almost the desired equation except that the pupil diameter refers to a size within the
eye which is not readily available. The size p of the pupil as seen from the outside, called the
entrance pupil, is slightly larger than the actual size, since the physical pupil is seen through
the cornea, that is, through a magnifying lens. However, since the lens is close to the nodal
point, the enlargement is small and we will neglect it here. Thus, the size of the blur disk on
the retina, in radians, is given to a good approximation by the above equation (Equation 8),
where p is the size of the entrance pupil, that is, the size as seen from the outside, and D is
defocus in the air. It is a linear relationship between angular blur-disk diameter and defocus,
with the slope given by the pupil diameter.
Often, we are in a situation where we do not know the accommodation error in diopters
but do know by how much an image is too near or too far from the eye. Following James
Jurin's example, find your personal near point and then, gradually, move the object closer.
Or, if you are myopic, take off your glasses and move the object a little farther away than
your far point. The image (from the well-focused case) will then, effectively, be convolved by
a blur disk, the linear size bstim
of which is given by
bstim ¼ p
dfoc À dstim
dstim







 ; ð9Þ
where p, as before, is effective pupil diameter, dfoc
is the distance of the focal plane (e.g., the
near point), and dstim
is the distance of the stimulus. Like Equation (3), this follows directly
from the Intercept Theorem (similar triangles), now applied, however, to the exterior space
instead of to the interior of the eye (cf. Smith, 1982b, p. 15; Equation 16).
Examples
Figure 6 shows the linear relationship of Equation (1) (or, with rescaling, of Equation (8)) for
a quick look at what blur-disk diameter to expect at a certain defocus for an adult subject.
Workplace progressive addition lenses, for example, with half a diopter undercorrection for
far vision, would thus give a blur disk of approximately 0.1 ¼ 60 visual angle, disregarding
other factors. Note that with less than about ¼ D defocus, factors other than defocus become
more prominent in determining blur (Artal, 2014).
As a further example, let us consider the near point for an observer with a natural
lens--the closest distance for an object to appear in focus with a given accommodation
capability (Figure 7). With proper accommodation, no dioptric blur occurs; this results in
constant acuity as long as distance is large enough to be within the range of accommodation.
That acuity along the blue segment is referred to as the distance acuity, here set to a value
equivalent to the acuity achieved with a blur circle of 1 arcmin diameter. Proximal to the limit
of accommodation, dioptric blur increases and degrades acuity (solid red line). When the near
point is determined by deciding when the approaching target starts appearing blurred, the
just-noticeable difference in blur (indicated by gray shading above the blue line) results in a
small additional shift in the subjective near point. The dashed red line represents the blur-
circle diameter in the case of a fixed focal length, for example in a person with a monofocal
intraocular lens, assumed to be in-focus at 50 cm. This also approximates the situation when
wearing single-vision reading glasses in advanced presbyopia with little or no residual

observer), dioptric blur increases and degrades acuity (solid red line). The dashed red line represents the

transition between distance acuity and blur-affected near acuity is less abrupt than
depicted, as the switch between the two operating ranges is not sudden.
Visual Acuity and Defocus
Let us finally turn to a question that will quickly arise in the context of blur: How is acuity
affected by defocus? Acuity will obviously be best when blur is minimal (see Artal, 2014, for a
qualification of that assertion), so a better question is how much is acuity reduced by defocus?
Let vbc
denote the visual decimal acuity achieved with the best correction in place, and v the
acuity with blur present. We are then seeking how the degradation factor v/vbc
depends on
defocus, that is, on the spherical error, which we have called D above. Here, Blendowske
(2015) has derived a surprisingly simple empirical relationship for the reduction of acuity:
v=vbc
¼
1
1 þ D2
; ð10Þ
where v/vbc
is visual acuity (decimal or Snellen fraction) relative to the best-corrected case,
and D is the spherical error in diopters (Figure 8). Blendowske's equation (which in his
publication also includes cylindrical refractive errors which we omit here) was inspired by
Raasch (1995), who had fit a second-order polynomial to a large set of empirical data with
natural pupil sizes, relating acuity to (spherical and cylindrical) refractive error. Blendowske
extended that data set to include even more published data, in particular data for small
refractive errors, again with natural pupils of diameters in the range from 2 to 5 mm.
It turned out that, by estimating relative rather than absolute acuity, Blendowske obtained
his much simpler Equation (10), which (unlike Raasch's equation or the Equations (1) or (8)
above) also works well for low refractive errors, down to zero diopters. Note that the

equation is based on empirical data, not on physical modeling, and thus naturally includes
the influences of higher order aberrations and diffraction. Note further that pupil size,
although it influences acuity, does not appear in the equation. Nevertheless, the fit to the
data is very good, also at small values of D, with a regression standard error of 0.046 log
units; residual error mostly stemmed from not controlling for pupil size. As a practical
example, mis-accommodation by ½, 1, 2, or 3 D in a subject having 1.0 decimal acuity
will degrade that to a value of 0.8, 0.5, 0.2, or 0.1, respectively.
For small values of defocus the equation simplifies further, to
v=vbc % 1 À D2 for small D 6% error below ½ D
ð Þ: ð11Þ
Since the graphs for the (empirical) Equations (10) and (11) have a ½horizontal tangent at
zero diopters, there is rather little change of acuity with blur for small blur values (<¼ D), a
familiar finding in everyday practice.
Visual acuity (as measured with grating stimuli) is essentially determined by the high-
frequency end of the contrast sensitivity function (effects of blur also extend to other parts
of the contrast sensitivity function of course). This is quantified by the corresponding
modulation transfer function (see, for instance, Smith, 2000, Figure 11.16 on p. 378).
Conclusion
We have illustrated and discussed choosing the proper blur kernel to simulate visual
degradation. In the case of defocus, this is a simple disk. Different blur kernels may
produce qualitatively different images. In particular, Gaussian blur does not introduce
spurious resolution and related effects and is thus fundamentally different from the blur
that is associated with typical optical problems. The blur-disk's diameter, except for small
values of defocus, is proportional to defocus in diopters and pupil size; its linear size in a
stimulus is proportional to the stimulus' relative distance from the near or far point.
Degradation of visual acuity from its best-corrected value is related to defocus blur by
a simple (inverse) second-order equation in a wide range of defocus including small
values.

pencils of rays issuing from the object. This circle fghc we shall call the circle of dissipation, because
the rays of a pencil, instead of being collected into the central point c, are dissipated all over this
circle: And the radius of this circle. . . we shall for the same reason call the radius of dissipation.''
(Jurin, 1738, p. 117)
3. ``Upon white paper draw the circumference of a circle with a strong black line and place the paper by
guess about the farthest distance at which your eye can see an object distinctly [Jurin assumes a
myopic person here]. Then retiring gradually farther from the paper, observe at what distance the
white circle. . . appears equal in breath to the penumbra on either side of it. At that distance the radius
of dissipation is nearly equal to half the radius of the true image of the circle.'' (Jurin, 1738, p. 131)
4. Jurin (incorrectly) believed that accommodation works symmetrically, accommodating distances
both nearer to and farther from what he calls a natural distance of 33 in.:
137.. . . Whence it is reasonable to conclude, that the natural distance is such, as that no
greater change of conformation is required to reduce it to the least distance, than to increase
it to the greatest distance at which we can see distinctly. (Jurin, 1738, p. 141)
5. A point-spread function is the 2D equivalent of an impulse-response function. It allows an easy
derivation of the resulting image, that is, here the blurred image: According to the Convolution
Theorem, the blurred image is simply the convolution of the point-spread function with the original
image.
6. A few misprints in Smith (1982a) hinder the understanding of Derivation no. 1 presented there (the
derivation inside the eye, corresponding to the one here): (1) It should be dl0 instead of fl0 on the
right side in Equation (4), so that Equation (3) can be inserted in it. (2) The sign of the
accommodation level L0
in Equation (6a) is incorrect and the equation should be (Fe
)R
¼ Fe
þ L0
instead. The term then cancels with the denominator in Equation (5). (3) The power of the relaxed
eye (Fe
)R
is said (a few lines further down) ``to be equivalent to'' the distance of the back nodal point
from the retina, N0F0. This is shorthand for saying that one is the inverse of the other, that is,
(Fe
)R
¼ 1/N0F0. Typically, however, the power of the relaxed eye (Fe
)R
is considered as taken from
the back principal point H0, not the back nodal point N0: (Fe
)R
¼ n0/H0F0. Yet the ratio of the two
distances equals the refractive index, that is, H0F0/N0F0 ¼ n0, so the two assertions are equivalent.
