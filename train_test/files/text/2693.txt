Abstract
Background: The Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica has one of the highest old-age life expectancies in the world, but
the underlying biological mechanisms of this longevity are not well understood. As DNA methylation is hypothesized
to be a component of biological aging, we focused on this malleable epigenetic mark to determine its association
with current residence in Nicoya versus elsewhere in Costa Rica. Examining a population's unique DNA methylation
pattern allows us to differentiate hallmarks of longevity from individual stochastic variation. These differences may be
characteristic of a combination of social, biological, and environmental contexts.
Methods: In a cross-sectional subsample of the Costa Rican Longevity and Healthy Aging Study, we compared
whole blood DNA methylation profiles of residents from Nicoya (n = 48) and non-Nicoya (other Costa Rican regions,
n = 47) using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 microarray.
Results: We observed a number of differences that may be markers of delayed aging, such as bioinformatically
derived differential CD8+ T cell proportions. Additionally, both site- and region-specific analyses revealed DNA meth
ylation patterns unique to Nicoyans. We also observed lower overall variability in DNA methylation in the Nicoyan
population, another hallmark of younger biological age.
Conclusions: Nicoyans represent an interesting group of individuals who may possess unique immune cell propor
tions as well as distinct differences in their epigenome, at the level of DNA methylation.

Background
Aging is a complex biological process that progressively
leads to physiological decline and an increased risk of
mortality. The genetic component of life span is approxi-
mated to be less than 30%, leaving the remainder to be
determined by environmentally and socially influenced
factors such as diet, exposure to infection, and lifestyle
choices [1, 2]. While the mechanistic regulation of these
non-genetic influences is poorly understood, previous
work has suggested that epigenetic processes may be
tightly interwoven with biological aging [3].
Epigenetics generally refers to the study of altered
chromatin states, such as modifications to DNA and
the proteins involved in its packaging and regula-
tion. To date, DNA methylation (DNAm) is the most
commonly studied epigenetic mark in human popula-
tions, as recent advances in technology have allowed
for the inexpensive high-throughput measurement
of >400,000 CpG sites across the genome. There are
many other studied epigenetic processes, such as post-
translational histone modifications, histone variants,
and noncoding RNAs; however, these modifications
have been more of a focus in model organism research
and cancer biology.

DNAm is one type of epigenetic modification that
impacts how genes are expressed and thus can have
important phenotypic and functional consequences for
an organism. Unlike the DNA sequence itself, DNAm is
changeable through environmental influences over an
individual's life course. DNAm involves the covalent addi-
tion of a methyl group to the 5 carbon of cytosine nuce-
lotides, most often in the context of CpG dinucleotides
(cytosine­phosphate­guanine). Genetic variants, such
as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), can affect
DNAm at nearby CpG sites, called methylation quanti-
tative trait loci (mQTL) [4]. DNAm also varies in asso-
ciation with environmental and behavioral factors, such
as diesel exposure and smoking. Additionally, variability
in DNAm accumulates across one's entire life span, dis-
cussed in detail below. DNAm patterns are associated
with altered gene activity. Shifts in DNAm levels may
follow a change in gene expression, or may act in the
recruitment of methylation-dependent transcription fac-
tors that regulate transcriptional machinery. Understand-
ing the effect of environmental influences on DNAm
is important for unraveling the intricate regulation of
genes and possible functional consequences of these
alterations.
Age-related DNAm encompasses at least two distinct
phenomena. First, specific CpGs associated with chrono-
logical age have been identified and, in some cases, rep-
licated in several human populations. These age-related
DNAm signatures can be either tissue specific or occur
across several tissue types [5]. The epigenetic clock is a
tool based on CpGs that change with age. Epigenetic
clocks are DNAm-based markers of biological age, either
confined to a single tissue or consistently accurate across
tissues [6­8]. Deviations from these epigenetic age esti-
mates, referred to as a measure of age acceleration,
have been associated with an increased risk of all-cause
mortality, time until death, and frailty [9­11]. Second,
variability increases with age due to stochastic non-site-
specific changes in DNAm, a process referred to as epige-
netic drift [12].
It is critical to address cell-type heterogeneity when
investigating DNAm patterns in tissues containing
mixed cell types. Not only does cell type change over
one's life span but it is also the primary source of varia-
tion in DNAm across healthy individuals. DNAm profiles
obtained from identical cell types, but separate individu-
als, show higher similarity than two different cell types
from the same individual [13]. Given that isolating DNA
from a single cell type is not always feasible or that cell
count information is sometimes not available, bioinfor-
matics-based methods have been developed to estimate
cell-type proportions using DNAm profiles in blood and
brain [14, 15]. The blood-based predictions are closely
correlated with complete blood count measures, thus
suggesting the validity of these methods to derive accu-
rate blood count information bioinformatically [16]. It is
also worth noting that measures of epigenetic age accel-
eration specific to whole blood have been defined to
account for age-induced changes to cell-type proportions
[6]. These measures are integral when analyzing DNAm
from whole blood, as the proportion of certain blood cell
types, such as CD8+ memory and naïve T cells, change
with age [17].
Aging research in humans commonly investigates the
unique biological and lifestyle characteristics of individu-
als surviving to old age [18]. An alternative approach,
used in the current study design, is to examine the under-
lying biology of longevity by examining a population
characterized as having a particularly high old-age life
expectancy [19], the Nicoya region of Costa Rica, and
comparing it to the rest of Costa Rica which has mod-
erately lower life expectancy. By averaging out the sto-
chastic variation in aging among individuals within each
geographic region of the country, this approach offers a
way to identify contextual (rather than individual) differ-
ences associated with healthy aging and longevity. While
the method of examining area-based determinants of
health and longevity has received substantial attention
in biomedical research [20], a lack of appropriate data
sources have limited its application in understanding the
biological mechanisms of longevity.
The Nicoya peninsula of Costa Rica has been char-
acterized by exceptionally high longevity, providing an
intriguing framework to explore the relationship between
DNAm and aging [21]. Mortality rates among elderly
Costa Ricans in Nicoya are substantially lower than in the
rest of Costa Rica, with individuals in Nicoya being some
of the most long lived in the world. The relative mortal-
ity rate of Nicoya as compared to similar age cohorts in
the rest of Costa Rica is 0.80. This advantage remains sig-
nificant after statistical control for level of education and
type of health insurance [21]. The Nicoyan advantage is
particularly evident in cardiovascular disease, despite the
fact that risk factors like smoking, physical activity and
systolic blood pressure are similar throughout Costa Rica.
One key indicator of the Nicoyan advantage is longer knee
height--an anthropometric biomarker that is associated
with early childhood environment [22]. Nicoyans also
have lower BMI, waist circumference, and, among men,
lower levels of HbA1c, glucose, triglycerides and total/
HDL cholesterol ratio [21]. We have previously shown
that leukocyte telomere length, an aging biomarker, also
has more favorable (longer) levels among Nicoyans com-
pared to individuals in the rest of Costa Rica [23].
In this study, we examined DNAm in a nationally rep-
resentative population of Costa Ricans, investigating
Page 3 of 14

potential biological differences that may help explain the
higher longevity observed in Nicoyans as compared to
other Costa Ricans. We focused on DNAm, as this epi-
genetic mark can be modified by environmental influ-
ences, has the potential to regulate gene expression, and
most importantly, has an established relationship with
aging across the mammalian life span. Using genome-
wide DNAm patterns to predict blood cell-type composi-
tion, we determined differential estimated proportions of
age-related immune cells. While we did not observe dif-
ferences in epigenetic age acceleration, we did find signif-
icantly decreased DNAm variability in Nicoyans. Finally,
we identified DNAm patterns unique to Nicoyans, at
both genomic regions and specific CpG sites. Under-
standing DNAm patterns between Nicoyans and other
Costa Ricans (non-Nicoyans) will offer new insights both
into the role of DNAm in aging and perhaps help to illu-
minate why Nicoyans have among the longest old-age life
expectancies.
Results
Cohort characteristics and DNA methylation data
We examined a subset of samples from the Costa Rican
Study on Longevity and Healthy Aging (CRELES), a lon-
gitudinal, nationally representative, and probabilistic
sample of close to 3000 adults aged 60 years and over
that were collected mostly in 2005, with over-sampling
of older ages [24]. We assayed DNAm profiles of 48
Nicoyans (longevity group) and 47 non-Nicoyans (con-
trol group). In order to maximize statistical power for
our age-based hypothesis, we randomly sampled half of
the individuals between the ages of 60 and 75 and the
other half aged 95 and above, selecting an equal number
in each age category among Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans
to have an age-matched sample. Table 1 shows the mean
characteristics of these populations. Nicoyans tend to
have lower levels of education and lower wealth than
non-Nicoyans, but are similar on observed health-related
characteristics. We obtained DNAm profiles from whole
blood using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 (450k)
array, a genome-wide microarray that quantifies DNAm
at over 485,000 sites. We applied data quality controls to
remove poor performing probes, probes that hybridized
the XY chromosomes, and probes predicted to cross-
hybridize [25]. Our final dataset for subsequent analyses
consisted of 441,109 sites.
Nicoyans had fewer estimated CD8+ memory and more
naïve T cells than nonNicoyans
Whole blood is a heterogeneous tissue containing cer-
tain cell types that change with age, with age-related
decreases occurring in CD8+ T, CD4+ T and B lym-
phocytes, and the greatest increases in natural killer
cells and monocytes [26]. To assess these differences in
our cohort, we performed a previously described blood
cell-type deconvolution [14] by using the DNAm profiles
of each sample to estimate the proportions of granulo-
cytes, natural killer cells, CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD4+
T lymphocytes, monocytes, and B lymphocytes. We
found that Nicoyans had a significantly lower propor-
tion of estimated CD8+ T cells when compared to non-
Nicoyans (Kruskal­Wallis p value = 0.0038) (Fig. 1a).
We also observed that Nicoyans had a higher mean
level of estimated granulocyte proportions, although
only reaching borderline significance (Kruskal­Wallis p
value = 0.0486). It is important to note that we did not
focus on the blood composition as a whole, as we were
primarily interested in specific age-related cell-type
trends.
To further investigate the differential proportion of
estimated CD8+ T cells, we applied a more detailed cell
deconvolution tool that provides an expanded estima-
tion of CD8+ T naïve cells (CD8+ CD45RA+ CCR7+)
and CD8+ T memory cells (CD8+ CD28- CD45RA-)
[6]. CD8+ T memory cells typically increase with age,
and CD8+ T naïve cells generally decrease with age
through thymic involution [27]. Given that these meas-
ures are proportional and highly correlated, it is statisti-
cally appropriate to assess the ratio of CD8+ T naïve
cells to CD8+ T memory cells (Additional file 1: Figure
S1). Using this approach, we found a significant difference
between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans (Kruskal­Wallis p
value = 0.0135). We observed a greater abundance of pre-
dicted CD8+ T naïve cells in Nicoyans and a lower abun-
dance of estimated CD8+ T memory cells in Nicoyans, as

compared to non-Nicoyans (Fig. 1b). These trends were
suggestive of a younger immune cell profile in Nicoyans.
Pearson's correlation coefficients were computed to
assess the relationship between chronological age (log
transformed) and the estimated proportion of each
CD8+ T cell type (Fig. 1c). We observed a negative cor-
relation between chronological age and CD8+ T naïve
proportion (Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans; Pearson's
r = -0.55 and -0.61, respectively). As expected, there
was a positive correlation between age and CD8+ T
memory cells (Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans; Pearson's
r = 0.61, and 0.61, respectively; Fig. 1c), demonstrating
a known immunological aging trend, but here based on
epigenetic data. We found no significant difference in the
regression slopes of chronological age on either CD8+
T cell type, when comparing Nicoyans to non-Nicoyans
(p > 0.50); while we did observe differences in mean lev-
els of both estimated CD8+ T cell types, we did not see
any group difference in the nature of how these cell types
changed across age.

Epigenetic age did not differ between Nicoyans
and nonNicoyans
Having established differences in estimated CD8+ T cell
populations between the two groups, we next examined
DNAm age as an established metric of biological aging.
We examined DNAm age of Nicoyans compared to non-
Nicoyans using three epigenetic clocks, which provided
measures of biological age using DNAm levels at differ-
ent groups of CpG sites (Fig. 2a) [6­8]. Across all sam-
ples, we found correlations between DNAm age and
chronological age (Horvath: Pearson's r = 0.86, Han-
num: Pearson's r = 0.85, Weidner: Pearson's r = 0.86).
However, we found no significant difference between
Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans in terms of DNAm age (as
calculated by each clock), while adjusting for chrono-
logical age (ANOVA p > 0.30, 95% CI for the Horvath
clock was -6.3 to 3.8 years). We did, however, observe
a mean difference of -6.9 years between epigenetic age
and chronological age for all samples, suggesting that
Costa Ricans, inclusive of both Nicoyans and non-Nicoy-
ans, may on average be epigenetically younger than their
chronological age (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we reduced our
data to only centenarians (age  100 years old), and the
mean absolute difference between DNAm age and chron-
ological age was -12.7 years.
We further examined biological age by assessing two
other recently defined measures of age acceleration:
intrinsic and extrinsic epigenetic acceleration, which are
independent and dependent of blood cell-type propor-
tions, respectively. We did not find any significant differ-
ence between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans in any of these
acceleration measures (ANOVA p  0.5, Additional file 2:
Figure S2).
DNA methylation variability was lower in Nicoyans
After assessing whether any differences in epigenetic age
existed, we next investigated epigenetic drift between
Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans. We hypothesized that lower
variability in Nicoyans would be representative of a bio-
logically younger profile based on the epigenetic drift
phenomenon where stochastic variation in DNAm occurs
with age. We calculated the interquantile range (IQR) at
each CpG site (90th­10th percentile) represented on the
450k array to account for outliers and found a significant
variability difference between Nicoyans and non-Nicoy-
ans (Wilcoxon signed-rank test; p < 2.2 × 10-16), with a
lower level of total mean DNAm variation in Nicoyans
(Fig. 3a). Furthermore, we assessed the level of DNAm
variability across individuals between 60 and 80 years
old and individuals >80 years old, in Nicoyans and non-
Nicoyans. We found a lower DNAm variability in the
younger group, in both populations. However, there was
a greater difference between the non-Nicoyan old and
young age groups compared to the Nicoyans respective
age groups (non-Nicoya: IQR mean difference = 0.0065,
p < 2.2 × 10-16, Nicoya: IQR mean difference = 0.0043,
p = 1.79 × 10-10). Lastly, when a  value IQR thresh-
old of 5% was applied to only variable sites, we found
129,971 and 146,047 variable sites in the >80-year-old
range of Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans, respectively. For
the younger age range, we found 116,038 and 120,711
sites that had greater than 5% IQR in Nicoyans and non-
Nicoyans, respectively (Fig. 3b). In summary, we found
a lower degree of DNAm variability was associated
with Nicoyans for both age groups, 60­80 years old and
>80 years old, when compared to non-Nicoyans.
Unique regionbased differential methylation in Nicoyans
We next investigated differentially methylated regions
(DMRs) between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans to identify
unique epigenetic signatures that may be associated with
the longevity observed in Nicoya. Using the R package
`DMRcate,' we found that in the comparison of Nicoyans
and non-Nicoyans, 20 DMRs containing three or more
CpG sites passed a false discovery rate of 0.05, as well as
an arbitrary biological cutoff of a  value  5% between
groups for at least one CpG site in each DMR (Table 2;
Fig. 4; Additional file 3: Figure S3). Age, sex, and blood
cell-type proportions were used as covariates. DMRs
were associated with genes based on the closest proxim-
ity to a transcription start site (TSS). The mean length

of the DMRs was 411 bp, with the shortest being 76 bp
and the longest being 1416 bp. On average, out of the 20
DMRs observed, there were seven CpG sites per region,
with a range from 3 to 16. Six DMRs were found within
1500 bp of a TSS associated with the following genes'
promoter region: Nudix Hydrolase 12 (NUDT12) (6
CpGs), Vault-RNA-2 (VTRNA2-1) (16 CpGs), Peptidase
M20 Domain Containing 1 (PM20D1) (8 CpGs), Active
BCR-Related (ABR) (3 CpGs), tRNA-Leu (5 CpGs), and
LOC100128885 (uncharacterized) (3 CpGs). The major-
ity of DMRs were found in intergenic regions (8/20) with
an average number of four CpGs per DMR and average
length of 267 bp. Four DMRs were found in the body
(intragenic) of the following genes: Glutamate-rich pro-
tein 1 (ERICH1) (8 CpGs), Hook Microtubule Tethering
Protein 2 (HOOK2) (4 CpGs), GATA2 Antisense RNA 1
(GATA2-AS1) (3 CpGs), and C15orf26 (uncharacterized)
(4 CpGs). Two DMRs were found in the 3end regions
of Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L21 (MRPL21) (3
CpGs) and BolA family member 3 (BOLA3) (5 CpGs).
The average absolute difference in DNAm between
Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans was 7.9% when assessing the
single CpG site for each DMR that showed the greatest
difference between groups. When DNAm was averaged
across the DMR per group, the mean  value difference
was 5.9%.
Sitespecific differential methylation in Nicoyans
and technical verification
To complement the region-specific analysis, we also
assessed DNAm differences at the site-by-site level to
identify any single sites that were differentially meth-
ylated in Nicoyans as compared to non-Nicoyans. By
investigating site-specific changes, we did not limit our-
selves to highly represented genomic regions on the 450k
array. We performed an epigenome-wide association
study using a linear model of population group regressed
on M values at each CpG site, with sex, age, and blood
cell-type proportions included as covariates (Additional
file 4: Figure S4). We observed nine CpGs below a nomi-
nal p value significance threshold of p  5 × 10-7 (q
value < 0.022, Table 3) that were differentially methylated
between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans. After applying a
biological threshold similar to the DMRcate analysis, four
CpG sites passed our significance criteria: cg02853387
(DSCAML1), cg02438481 (C6orf123), cg13979274
(OR10H1), cg26107275 (BC042649). Not surprisingly, the
four significant CpG sites did not overlap with our DMR
findings, as these single CpGs identified through the
site-by-site analysis were either: (1) found in a genomic
region with no proximal array probes, or (2) nearby CpGs
sites were not significantly correlated. The nearest neigh-
boring array-CpG probe was greater than 1 kb away for
three out of the four significant CpG sites (cg02853387,
cg13979274, and cg26107275). While for cg02438481, the
closest array-CpG (cg00788354) was 324 bp away, it had a
Pearson's correlation of r < 0.10 and was not significantly
differentially methylated between groups.
We performed pyrosequencing, a targeted DNAm
sequencing technology, to verify that our single dif-
ferential DNAm results were reproducible using an
independent platform. We designed assays to measure

non-Nicoyans, we confirmed these associations by sta-
tistically regressing DNAm determined by pyrosequenc-
ing onto group status, while controlling for age, cell-type
proportions, and sex. All three sites remained signifi-
cantly different between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans
(Table 3; Fig. 5).
Lastly, to determine whether a measure of genetic
population structure was confounded with group
(Nicoyans vs non-Nicoyans), we performed a post hoc
analysis using `Epistructure' [28]. Principal component
analysis was completed on DNAm of CpGs previously
identified as genetically informative loci. The first two
principal components generated from this analysis have
been proposed to confer composites of genetic struc-
ture to be used as covariates in a DNAm analysis. Using
this technique, we did not observe a significant differ-
ence between the Epistructure principal components
of the measures in Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans, while
controlling for sex, age, and cell-type proportions (PC1:
p = 0.60, PC2: p = 0.93, Additional file 5: Figure S5);
therefore, we did not include these measures in our
analyses.

Discussion
In this study, we investigated differential patterns of DNAm
in a population with well-characterized high longevity:
Nicoya, Costa Rica. We aimed to identify unique patterns
of DNAm that may underlie biological pathways associ-
ated with the longevity observed in Nicoya. Our study
sample was drawn from a nationally representative demo-
graphic study of Costa Ricans age 60 years and over, and
we randomly sampled individuals from within Nicoya and
the rest of Costa Rica who were aged 60­75 and 95 years
and above in order to assess age-associated DNAm. We
have four primary findings. First, we observed a bioin-
formatically inferred younger immune profile in Nicoyan
individuals compared to those living in the rest of Costa
Rica, finding cellular proportion differences in CD8+
naïve and CD8+ memory T cells. Next, we found a lower
level of total mean DNAm variation in Nicoyans compared
to non-Nicoyans. We found 20 DMRs and four single CpG
sites that were differentially methylated between Nicoy-
ans and non-Nicoyans. While any of these differences we
observed may be due to genetic differences in the popula-
tions, the fact that we show that estimated genetic struc-
ture did not differ between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans
suggests that these biological differences are more likely to
be the result of environmental differences between these
two populations. Lastly, DNAm age was not significantly
different between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans, although
Costa Ricans overall had a younger mean DNAm age than
the mean chronological age.
Our finding of proportional differences in CD8+ naïve
and CD8+ memory T cells is intriguing in the context
of previous work from animal models and other human
research that has established that these blood cell pro-
portions change as a function of age. Specifically, the
naïve T cell response diminishes with time as they are
naturally replaced by memory T cells through age-related
thymic involution [17, 29]. Therefore, younger immune
profiles have been hypothesized to delay the onset of
infection vulnerability and extend health span [30]. Inter-
estingly, centenarian offspring have been investigated in
this context and show this `youthful' immune cell pheno-
type [31]. The fact that our work suggested that Nicoy-
ans had a lower proportion of CD8+ T memory cells and
higher CD8+ T naïve cells is interesting in the context of
immunoaging and might be suggestive of an age-related
immune phenotype in Nicoyans.
Given their lower mortality rate, we were surprised
about the lack of differences in DNAm age between
Nicoyans non-Nicoyans, especially given that this bio-
logical aging measure has been associated with many
age-related conditions such as cognitive fitness decline,
frailty, and mortality [9, 11, 32]. It is important to note,
however, that we only had the statistical power to test for
a very large difference in DNAm age, and our 95% con-
fidence interval suggests that Nicoyan individuals could
be up to 6 years younger in DNAm age. We calculated
epigenetic age in our samples using three published
DNAm age predictors and found no significant difference
in these measures of biological age between Nicoyans
and non-Nicoyans. Previous work found that peripheral
blood mononuclear cells from the offspring of semi-super
centenarians, in an Italian cohort, appear 5.1 years epige-
netically younger than controls. Centenarians also were
reportedly 8.6 years younger than their chronological age
[33]. This is consistent with our population; when we col-
lapsed the Nicoyan and non-Nicoyan groups, we found
centenarians were 12.7 years epigenetically younger. Fur-
thermore, all Costa Ricans were 6.9 years epigenetically
younger than their chronological age. It is possible that
this might reflect the recently reported epigenetically
younger phenotype in Hispanic populations [34].
To examine age-associated DNAm variability, we
assessed a measure of variance in Nicoyans and non-
Nicoyans independently. We were able to demonstrate
the phenomenon of epigenetic drift within each of these
groups, as our sample consisted of two age ranges in each
group. Additionally, we observed that DNAm variation
was lower in Nicoyans, both in the 80-year-old and in the
>80-year-old age groups, when compared to non-Nicoyans.
Given that DNAm variability across individuals has been
reported to increase with age, our finding may highlight an
epigenetic characteristic of the longevity in Nicoyans [12].
Although the biological pre- and antecedents of increased
DNAm variability are poorly understood, our findings
suggest lower DNAm variability may be associated with
lower mortality. Some explanations for this age-associated
DNAm variability have been proposed, such that DNAm
variability may result from a functional decline in DNAm
maintenance machinery or that the variability is a product
of environmental exposures over time [35].
We found 20 genomic regions and four single CpGs that
were significantly differentially methylated between Nicoy-
ans and non-Nicoyans. One such DMR contained six
CpGs and was located in the promoter region of NUDT12,
a gene encoding a protein shown in vitro to cleave NADH,
NADPH, and NAD+ [36]. Given that NUDT12 may play a
role in NAD metabolism, a regulatory process associated
with health span and aging, it is consistent with the fact
that DNAm may be involved in the regulation of this gene
that may have downstream effects on NAD biosynthe-
sis. Nicoyans had a lower level of DNAm in the promoter
region of NUDT12, a signature often associated with
higher gene expression. In addition to our DMR findings,
we also found four individual sites to be both statistically
and biologically significant, three of which existed in inter-
genic regions. We further investigated three of these CpGs
Page 11 of 14
McEwen et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin (2017) 10:21
by quantifying DNAm with pyrosequencing, allowing us
to verify both the accuracy of the 450k array and the sig-
nificant differences between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans.
However, it remains unclear whether differential DNAm
of these single CpGs or DMRs, at the observed effect sizes
(<10%), are sufficient to yield a biological change. Inter-
pretation of these findings at a biological level will require
future mechanistic experiments.
Our findings should be interpreted within the context
of several limitations. One limitation was the lack of gen-
otype information for these samples, as genetic variation
is considerably associated with DNAm [37]. In order to
reduce genetic heterogeneity, we restricted control sam-
pling to areas within Costa Rica, but outside of Nicoya.
Nicoyan status is determined as of the time of the survey,
i.e., at older ages, not based on birth or life-course resi-
dence, but in our sample 44 out of 48 Nicoyan residents
have lived there their entire lives. While there are no docu-
mented differences between the historical migration pat-
terns of the inhabitants of Nicoya and the rest of Costa
Rica, minor differences may exist. Therefore, we imple-
mented a recently published tool to infer genetic informa-
tion using DNAm data obtained from the 450k array called
`Epistructure,' a tool from the python package GLINT [28].
We found no significant difference in population structure
measures between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans and thus
did not include these composite measures in our analy-
ses. Another consideration of our study results is that we
used a bioinformatics approach to predict CD8+ T cell
proportions, which are relative compositional estimates.
As these predictions do not estimate actual cell counts,
the abundance of other cell types will affect the propor-
tional estimate of the CD8+ T cells. Ideally, we will need
to validate our findings using a quantitative approach,
such as fluorescent-activated cell sorting, to obtain actual
cell counts. We note, perhaps not surprisingly, that we did
not observe a significant difference when we performed
an overall compositional analysis of these predictions [38],
meaning that the blood composition overall was not dif-
ferent between Nicoyans and non-Nicoyans. However, our
findings are supported by using two separate reference-
based approaches [6, 14], both of which identified CD8+ T
cells as being significantly different between Nicoyans and
non-Nicoyans. Furthermore, these bioinformatic cell-type
proportion predictions have been well validated in the lit-
erature when compared to actual cell counts, and so we
were confident that this approach reflected true cell-type
proportions [16].
Conclusions
Our findings thus highlight DNAm as a potential fac-
tor underlying the unique longevity observed in Nicoya
region of Costa Rica. This work also supports the
demographic data on longevity as characterizing this
population as unique. The specific differences in immune
cell proportions we observed in Nicoyans will lay the
framework for a validation study to observe whether
cell-sorting experiments yield similar results. Addition-
ally, the differential DNAm findings may provide a candi-
date list of CpGs to test for differences in other longevity
populations. Lastly, upon validating our findings, our
work will contribute to narrowing the focus of mechanis-
tic studies to assess whether the DNAm differences we
observed are involved in gene regulation that may alter
gene expression trajectories.
Methods
Sample preparation and data collection
Whole blood was collected from participants and
genomic DNA was extracted at the University of Costa
Rica from 2 ml of frozen whole blood using the phenol­
chloroform method. DNA was bisulfite converted with
the Zymo Research EZ DNA MethylationTM Kit (Irvine,
CA, USA). Approximately 160 ng of bisulfite-converted
DNA from each sample, with the addition of one tech-
nical replicate, was randomized across eight 450k array
BeadChips as well as sentrix row and run in one batch
according to the manufacturer's protocol (San Diego, CA,
USA).
Qiagen Pyromark Assay Design 2.0 software (Hilden,
Germany) was used to generate pyrosequencing assays
targeted to three 450k array CpGs. Pyrosequencing was
performed on the a Qiagen PyromarkTM Q96 (Hilden,
Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. All
primer sequences are listed in Additional file 6: Table S1.
Data preprocessing and normalization
Illumina GenomeStudio software (San Diego, CA, USA)
was used to subtract background noise and color correct
raw data using control probes. Data were extracted in the
form of an average  value matrix and imported into R
Statistical software for the remainder of data processing.
Logit-transformed  values to M values, a less heterosce-
dastic value, were used for all statistical analyses, whereas
 values were used for visualization purposes as they rep-
resent percent methylation (0 = no methylation, 1 = fully
methylated). We have included a comparison table of 
values compared to M values for CpGs identified in the
site-specific differential methylation analysis (Additional
file 7: Table S2).
All data processing and statistical analyses were imple-
mented in R version 3.2.3. We removed a subset of probes
that could potentially lead to erroneous results. These
consisted of 65 SNP control probes, probes that were
specific to either the X or Y sex chromosomes, probes
with missing  values or with a detection p  0.01 in 5
Page 12 of 14
McEwen et al. Epigenetics & Chromatin (2017) 10:21
or more samples, polymorphic CpG probes, and cross-
hybridizing XY probes. The total number of probes post-
filtering based on these criteria was 441,109 [25]. No
sample outliers were removed, defined as having more
than 5% of their total probes fail.
Subset-quantile within array normalization (SWAN)
was used to account for type I and II probe differences
on the 450k array [39]. Known technical variation (sen-
trix ID and position) was accounted for with the func-
tion `ComBat' [40]. Confirmation of these corrections
was assessed before and after using principal component
analysis.
Estimation of blood cell proportions
A validated cellular deconvolution method was used
to estimate cell-type proportions in each blood sample,
namely CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, natural killer cells, B
cells, monocytes and granulocytes [16]. The predicted
abundance levels of CD8+ T naïve and CD8+ T memory
were obtained from the `Advanced Blood Analysis' of the
online DNAm age predictor [6]. Significance values were
generated from performing a Kruskal­Wallis test for
each cell-type proportion by group.
Prediction of epigenetic age
Three epigenetic clocks were used to predict biological
age. The `Horvath' and `Hannum' estimates were computed
with the online epigenetic clock software [6, 7]. The `Wei-
dner' age prediction was generated using the previously
described 99 CpG model [41]. We investigated, to the best
of our ability, the possibility that this finding was due to
a global batch effect influencing all samples by perform-
ing the DNAm age calculation on raw data, after SWAN
normalization data, and again after ComBat correction.
In all cases, the mean DNAm age for all Costa Ricans was
younger than the mean chronological age. We chose to
proceed with calculating DNAm age using the most cor-
rected data as we expected data that is corrected for tech-
nical batch effects, inclusive of probe design and chip­chip
variance, to best represent true biological signal.
DNA methylation analysis
The R package `DMRcate' was used to find DMRs [42].
The DMRcate model contained Nicoya group, chrono-
logical age, sex, and estimated cell-type proportions. This
tool uses a Gaussian kernel smoothing of DNAm across
the genome. Benjamini­Hochberg (BH) method was
applied with a threshold of  0.05 and a  value differ-
ence of  5% [43].
Site-specific differential DNAm analysis was con-
ducted using moderated t-statistics with empirical
Bayesian variation estimation using the bioconductor R
package `limma' with chronological age, sex, and cell-type
proportions as covariates [44]. M values consisted of log-
transformed  values to achieve a measure with uniform
variation and decreased heteroscedasticity. Significance
values were corrected for multiple testing using the BH
method [43].
DNAm variability was calculated using the interquan-
tile range (IQR) across the 90th and 10th percentiles of
each group, independently, at each CpG. A significance
value was generated by performing a Wilcoxon signed-
rank test between groups.
Inferred genetic ancestry
Population structure was inferred using the `Epistructure'
command-line tool GLINT [28]. This method applies
principal component analysis on a reference list of
genetically informative 450k array probes. This tool sug-
gests the top two principal components can infer genetic
structure. Linear regression was used for comparison of
each PC and group status, while adjusting for sex, cell-
type proportions, and age.
