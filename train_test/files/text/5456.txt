Abstract
A short-term exposure to moderately intense physical exercise affords a novel measure of protection against autoimmune-
mediated peripheral nerve injury. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which forced exercise attenuates the development
and progression of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), an established animal model of Guillain­Barre
´ syndrome. Adult
male Lewis rats remained sedentary (control) or were preconditioned with forced exercise (1.2 km/day Â 3 weeks) prior to
P2-antigen induction of EAN. Sedentary rats developed a monophasic course of EAN beginning on postimmunization day
12.3 Æ 0.2 and reaching peak severity on day 17.0 Æ 0.3 (N ¼ 12). By comparison, forced-exercise preconditioned rats
exhibited a similar monophasic course but with significant (p <.05) reduction of disease severity. Analysis of popliteal
lymph nodes revealed a protective effect of exercise preconditioning on leukocyte composition and egress. Compared
with sedentary controls, forced exercise preconditioning promoted a sustained twofold retention of P2-antigen responsive
leukocytes. The percentage distribution of pro-inflammatory (Th
1) lymphocytes retained in the nodes from sedentary EAN
rats (5.1 Æ 0.9%) was significantly greater than that present in nodes from forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats
(2.9 Æ 0.6%) or from adjuvant controls (2.0 Æ 0.3%). In contrast, the percentage of anti-inflammatory (Th
2) lymphocytes
(7­10%) and that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes ($20%) remained unaltered by forced exercise preconditioning. These data do
not support an exercise-inducible shift in Th
1:Th
2 cell bias. Rather, preconditioning with forced exercise elicits a sustained
attenuation of EAN severity, in part, by altering the composition and egress of autoreactive proinflammatory (Th
1) lympho-
cytes from draining lymph nodes.

Introduction
Visceral-type obesity, secondary to a sedentary lifestyle, is
a marked independent risk factor for the development
and progression of several subacute or chronic diseases
(Rivera-Vega et al., 2014; Versini et al., 2014; Buryk
et al., 2015; Procaccini et al., 2015). Moderately intense
physical exercise, performed at regular intervals, is now
firmly recognized as a safe and effective intervention by
which to enhance quality of life, largely secondary to
improved mental and physical health (Apostolopoulos
et al., 2014). The physiologic response to exercise is multi-
factorial, affecting musculoskeletal, cardiovascular,

respiratory, endocrine, neural, and humoral and adaptive
immune systems. Early studies report that moderate exer-
cise enhances immune system function (Pedersen and
Ullum, 1994; Shephard et al., 1995). By altering
immune-mediated responses, exercise is emerging as a
viable adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the manage-
ment of disorders as seemingly diverse as anxiety, depres-
sion, cancer, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome,
Type 2 diabetes, and autoimmunity (McFarlin et al.,
2006; Ploeger et al., 2009; Speck et al., 2010; Gleeson
et al., 2011; Gordon et al., 2012; Apostolopoulos et al.,
2014).
The mechanisms by which exercise alters innate or
adaptive immunity in the normal, sedentary (nonathletic)
population remain enigmatic and are critically dependent
on the type, intensity, and duration of physical exercise
administered (Nieman, 1995; Nieman et al., 1995a;
Nieman et al., 1995b; Nielsen, 2003). In general, acute
exercise is frequently associated with enhanced proin-
flammatory signaling, as measured by induction of
macrophages (M1), CD4þ T cells (Th
1), and CD8þ cyto-
toxic T cells. Paradoxically, acute aerobic or resistance
training exercise programs, however, are reported to sig-
nificantly decrease the risk and severity of some inflam-
matory autoimmune diseases (Courtney et al., 2011;
Golbidi et al., 2012; Perandini et al., 2012). In some sub-
jects, intense chronic physical exercise may actually lead
to a collapse of natural immunity (Cook et al., 2013;
Thomas, 2013).
The underlying cellular mechanisms by which physical
exercise may modulate immune responses remain poorly
understood but may be attributed to changes in the func-
tional status (Th
1 vs. Th
2; M1 vs. M2) of inflammatory
immune cells (Pedersen, 2011; Goh et al., 2014). Proposed
as a novel source of anti-inflammatory cytokines
(Pedersen, 2011), repeated bouts of contracting skeletal
muscle may shift the balance of circulating monocyte or
T-cell populations from a pro-inflammatory (M1, Th
1) to
that of an anti-inflammatory (M2, Th
2) profile. By com-
parison, peripheral blood from endurance-trained ath-
letes contains elevated levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10)
and a greater population of CD4þCD25þCD127low T
regulatory cells, both anti-inflammatory markers
(Handzlik et al., 2013). Alternatively, a 30-min session
of aerobic cycling is reported to upregulate expression
of both pro- (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a] and IL-
6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-4) cytokines, suggesting
that acute aerobic exercise may precondition (or prime)
Th
1/M1 and Th
2/M2 immune mediators (Zaldivar et al.,
2006).
Experimentally, forced exercise has been shown to
attenuate development and progression of humoral and/
or cellular autoimmunity in animal models of rheumatoid
arthritis (Navarro et al., 2010), multiple sclerosis
(Bernardes et al., 2013), Guillain­Barre
´ syndrome
(Calik et al., 2012), as well as significantly delaying the
development of lung damage (Hung et al., 2013) and
neuropathic pain (Shankarappa et al., 2011; Chen et al.,
2013) in the streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic animal model.
Here, rats preconditioned with forced exercise were found
to exhibit a sustained protection against the development
and progression of experimental autoimmune neuritis
(EAN), an established CD4þ T-cell dependent rat
model of human inflammatory demyelinating neuropa-
thies. The protective effect of preconditioning was not
due to a shift in the Th
1:Th
2 cell bias but rather appears
to be the result of altering autoreactive leukocytes com-
position and egress from secondary lymphoid tissue.
Methods and Materials
This study was conducted using protocols approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in
accordance with the principles of laboratory animal
care (NIH publication No. 86-23, 1985). Animals were
housed three to a cage, allowed standard rat chow and
water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12 h/12 h light/dark
cycle. Adult male Lewis rats (initial body weight 200 g;
Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were randomly divided
into adjuvant control, sedentary, or forced-exercise inter-
vention groups.
Forced Exercise Preconditioning
Treadmill running is a well-established forced experimen-
tal training method that elicits marked adaptations in
rodents. Rats assigned to the forced-exercise precondi-
tioned intervention group were acclimated (5-day training
period) to a motorized treadmill (Exer 3/6 Open tread-
mill, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). Although
equipped with a motivational shock grid, this treadmill
feature was not used in an effort to minimize stress-
induced physiological changes. Training involved a grad-
ual transition at a zero grade incline toward a constant
velocity (20 m/min) and duration (60 min/day; 1.2 km/
day/rat) as previously described (Shankarappa et al.,
2011; Calik et al., 2012). Rats acclimated to treadmill
training were run for 60 min/day Â 5 days a week between
the hours of 10:00 h to 13:00 h for an additional 3 weeks.
Rats assigned to the sedentary intervention group were
allowed to explore an identically sized environment for
the same duration of time during the same time of day,
but without receiving an exercise challenge. Rats assigned
to the adjuvant control group were housed in their home
cages and received the same amount of handling. All rats
were weighed daily, and caloric balance between adju-
vant, sedentary, and forced-exercise preconditioned rats
was not monitored. Although all three groups of rats
steadily gained body weight throughout this study,
rats undergoing forced exercise gained weight at
2 ASN Neuro
a reduced rate compared with sedentary control rats
(Calik et al., 2012). At no time prior to EAN induction,
however, did forced-exercise preconditioned rats exhibit a
frank loss of body weight. Relative changes in muscle
mass or adrenal gland weights were not determined.
EAN Induction
Following a 3-week training regimen, sedentary and
forced-exercise preconditioned rats were actively induced
with EAN as previously described (Sarkey et al., 2007;
Calik et al., 2012). Rats were anesthetized with ketamine
(90 mg/kg)-xylazine (7.5 mg/kg) and 100 ml of a freshly
prepared fine-particle emulsion (1:1 v/v) containing
100 mg of a synthetic neuritogenic P2 peptide (53­78,
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard University,
Boston, MA, USA) suspended in sterile saline and incom-
plete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma­Aldrich) supplemented
with 10 mg/ml heat-inactivated Mycobacteria tuberculosis
(strain H37Ra; Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI, USA)
was injected into the left hind footpad. Inactive adjuvant
control rats were injected in the same way except neur-
itogenic P2 peptide was omitted.
All rats were scored daily for EAN development and
progression by investigators blinded to group assignment.
The severity of clinical signs was scored as follows: 0 ¼ no
symptoms; 1 ¼ flaccid tail; 2 ¼ abnormal gait; 3 ¼ mild para-
paresis; 4 ¼ severe paraparesis; 5 ¼ paraplegia. Intermediate
clinical signs were scored in increments of 0.5.
At peak of disease, sciatic nerves from sedentary or
forced-exercise preconditioned rats were harvested and
prepared for qualitative histopathological evaluation as
previously described (Sarkey et al., 2007).
Leukocyte Function Studies
P2-antigen-specific proliferation and cytokine production
assays were performed as we have previously described
(Sarkey et al., 2007). Adjuvant control, sedentary, or
forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats were sacrificed
by CO2
asphyxiation at either onset (Day 14) or peak
(Day 18) of disease, and secondary lymphoid tissue
(spleens and popliteal lymph nodes) was harvested.
Prepared splenic or nodal lymphocytes were cultured at
an initial density of 2.0 Â 106 cells/ml in Roswell Park
Memorial Institute-1640 media supplemented with 9%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.05 mM 2-mercap-
toethenol, 90 U/ml penicillin, and 90 mg/ml streptomycin.
Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of P2 anti-
gen (10 mg/ml) for 96 h. For the final 24 h of antigen
stimulation, 0.5 mCi of [3H]thymidine (6.7 Ci/mmol; MP
Biomedicals, USA) was added to each well. Labeled cells
were harvested by trypsinization and [3H]thymidine
incorporation into the splenic or nodal lymphocyte
DNA was determined using a Tri-Carb 2810 liquid
scintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer, USA). Cell culture
supernatants from parallel nonradiolabeled assays were
collected at 96 h and analyzed for the presence of inter-
feron-g (IFN-g), TNF-a, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10. The con-
tent of cytokines released into culture media was
quantified simultaneously using multiplex technology
with the Bio-plexTM system (Bio-Rad Laboratories,
Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) and a commercially available
rat cytokine Milliplex kit (Millipore, USA).
Flow Cytometry
Spleens or popliteal lymph nodes were harvested, and
trunk blood was collected (in 5 mM EDTA), at onset
(Day 14) or peak (Day 18) of disease from adjuvant con-
trol, sedentary, or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN
rats. To determine the relative (percent) abundance of
helper (Th
) and cytotoxic (Tc
) T lymphocytes retained in
these secondary lymphoid tissues, 1 Â 106 splenocytes,
nodal, or circulating leukocytes were co-incubated for
30 min at 4C with 1 mg each of fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/25) and
phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD8a
(clone G28) monoclonal antibodies (BioLegend, USA).
The abundance of Th
1 lymphocytes or activated Tc
lymphocytes was determined by co-incubating prepared
splenocytes, nodal, or circulating leukocytes with 1 mg
each of FITC-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/
25) or PE-conjugated mouse anti-rat CD8a (clone G28)
monoclonal antibody together with 1 mg of rabbit anti-rat
IL-12Rb1 (CD212, clone C-20) followed by 1 mg of allophy-
cocyanin (APC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (H þ L)
secondary antibody.
The abundance of Th
2 lymphocytes was determined by
co-incubating prepared splenocytes, nodal, or circulating
leukocytes with 1 mg each of FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-rat CD4 (clone W3/25) and PE-conjugated hamster
anti-rat CD278 (clone 398.4 A) monoclonal antibodies.
Co-immunostained lymphocytes were washed twice
with ice-cold bovine calf serum (5% in phosphate buffer
saline) and resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold buffered (pH
7.4) 4% paraformaldehyde. After 10 min, fixed cells were
washed twice and resuspended in serum-supplemented
phosphate buffer saline. Data were collected using a
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) Canto flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., USA).
Lymphocytes were gated according to their forward and
side scatter. In all cases, isotype controls were used to
quantify and correct for background fluorescence.
Statistical Analysis

cases, p < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Forced Exercise Preconditioning Attenuates the
Severity of EAN
Following a 3-week regimen of sedentary- or forced exer-
cise preconditioning, P2-immunized rats exhibited a
monophasic course of moderate to severe paraparesis
that is characteristic of EAN (Sarkey et al., 2007; Calik
et al., 2012). Sedentary rats exhibited onset of EAN
beginning on postimmunization day 12.3 Æ 0.2 (N ¼ 24),
with peaked severity observed at day 17.0 Æ 0.3 (N ¼ 12).
By comparison, forced-exercise preconditioned rats
exhibited a similar monophasic disease course, with
onset beginning on postimmunization day 12.6 Æ 0.2
(N ¼ 21) and peaking on day 15.7 Æ 0.2 (N ¼ 10).
Although forced exercise preconditioning did not signifi-
cantly alter the monophasic course of EAN, disease
severity in these rats was significantly less than that
observed in sedentary EAN rats (Figure 1(a)), consistent
with our previously reported findings (Calik et al., 2012).
In contrast, complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) only-
immunized control rats (adjuvant control animals) did
not develop EAN (Figure 1(a)).
Despite having access to water and food ad libitum, sed-
entary EAN rats lost approximately 15% of their postim-
munization day-10 body weight, consistent with this well-
established measure of onset and progression of EAN.
Similarly, the body weights of forced-exercise precondi-
tioned EAN rats also decreased with disease progression,
albeit to a significantly lesser degree (Figure 1(b)).
Adjuvant control rats, by comparison, did not exhibit
weight loss during the course of the study (Figure 1(b)).
In good agreement with our previous reported findings
(Sarkey et al., 2007), sciatic nerves harvested at peak of
disease from sedentary EAN rats exhibited marked histo-
pathological evidence of edema, inflammatory infiltrates,
myelin ovoids, and axonal damage (Figure 1(c), left
panel). In contrast, forced-exercise preconditioned EAN
rats exhibited qualitatively less histopathological evi-
dence of peripheral nerve injury (Figure 1(c), right panel).
Forced Exercise Preconditioning Promotes Retention
of Leukocytes in Popliteal Lymph Nodes
To examine whether forced exercise preconditioning
attenuates EAN severity by altering nodal egress of
autoreactive lymphocytes, popliteal lymph nodes from
sedentary or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats
were harvested and retention of total and P2-responsive
leukocytes quantified (Figure 2). Although the total
number of leukocytes retained in popliteal nodes from
sedentary EAN rats was not significantly different from
adjuvant controls, forced-exercise preconditioned EAN
rats exhibited a marked twofold increase in total nodal
cells recovered at either onset or peak of disease
(Figure 2(a)). In contrast, forced exercise preconditioning
did not alter the retention of splenic leukocytes (spleno-
cytes, data not shown).
Forced Exercise Preconditioning Preserves P2-
Antigen Responsiveness of Nodal Leukocytes
Nodal leukocytes recovered at disease onset from seden-
tary EAN rats proliferated robustly to P2-antigen stimu-
lation (Figure 2(b)). In contrast, P2-responsiveness of
nodal leukocytes harvested at peak of disease from sed-
entary EAN rats was significantly (p < .05) blunted
(Figure 2(b)). By comparison, nodal leukocytes harvested
from forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats at either
onset or peak of disease retained their proliferative
responsiveness to P2 antigen (Figure 2(b)).
Nodal leukocytes harvested at disease onset from exer-
cise-preconditioned rats exhibited constitutive IL-2
release (98 Æ 30 pg/ml, N ¼ 5) that was similar to leuko-
cytes from sedentary (79 Æ 20 pg/ml, N ¼ 5) or adjuvant
(85 Æ 36 pg/ml, N ¼ 5) control rats. By comparison, con-
stitutive release of IL-2 from nodal leukocytes harvested
from sedentary or adjuvant control rats at peak of disease
was significantly less (31 Æ 17 pg/ml, N ¼ 5; p < .05). In
contrast, nodal leukocytes harvested from exercise-pre-
conditioned rats at peak of disease retained their ability
to constitutively release IL-2 (109 Æ 18 pg/ml, N ¼ 5;
p < .05).
To determine whether retained nodal leukocytes were
functionally competent, we quantified constitutive and
P2-antigen-stimulated production of anti- (Figure 3)
and pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 4). Challenging
nodal leukocytes with P2 antigen elicited marked changes
in secreted IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, and IFN-g. Compared
with vehicle-stimulated controls (17 Æ 2 pg/ml, N ¼ 5),
nodal leukocytes harvested from sedentary rats at disease
onset exhibited a twofold increase in P2-antigen-stimu-
lated IL-6 release (36 Æ 15 pg/ml, N ¼ 5; p < .05). By com-
parison, exercise preconditioning did not alter P2-
antigen-stimulated IL-6 release (40 Æ 10 pg/ml, N ¼ 5).
At peak of disease, P2-antigen-stimulated release of IL-
6 from nodal leukocytes was statistically indistinguish-
able from vehicle-stimulated controls (data not shown).
Challenging nodal leukocytes harvested from seden-
tary rats at disease onset with P2 antigen produced a
measurable increase in IL-10 release that was markedly

potentiated by exercise preconditioning (Figure 3). At
peak of disease, however, P2-antigen-stimulated release
of IL-10 was statistically indistinguishable from vehicle-
stimulated controls (Figure 3).
P2-antigen also elicited significant increases in TNF-a
and IFN-g production from nodal leukocytes (Figure 4).
At onset of disease, nodal leukocyte TNF-a and IFN-g
cytokine responsiveness to P2-antigen was not altered by
forced exercise preconditioning (Figure 4). At peak of
disease, however, nodal leukocytes harvested from seden-
tary rats were refractive to P2-antigen stimulation. In
marked contrast, nodal leukocytes harvested from
forced-exercise preconditioned rats at peak of disease
retained their P2-antigen responsiveness (Figure 4(a)

The ratio of Th
1:Th
2 CD4þ lymphocytes retained in
lymphoid tissue harvested from sedentary or forced-exer-
cise preconditioned EAN rats was determined by flow
cytometric analysis. Although forced exercise precondi-
tioning elicited an increase in total leukocyte retention
in popliteal lymph nodes (Figure 2), the percentage dis-
tribution of single-gated CD4þ (Th
) or CD8þ (Tc
)
lymphocytes recovered from the popliteal lymph nodes
of forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats was statistic-
ally indistinguishable from the nodes of sedentary EAN
rats or adjuvant controls (Tables 1 and 2). Similarly, the
percentage of CD4þ or CD8þ lymphocytes recovered
from spleens of sedentary (Th
: 49.6 Æ 1.3%, N ¼ 9; Tc
:
15.3 Æ 2.1%, N ¼ 6) or forced-exercise preconditioned
(Th
: 46.4 Æ 1.2%, N ¼ 9; Tc
: 17.3 Æ 1.1%, N ¼ 6) EAN
rats was also statistically indistinguishable.
By comparison, the percentage distribution of single-
gated CD4þ lymphocytes circulating in the blood of sed-
entary EAN rats (56.0 Æ 1.0%, N ¼ 6) at peak of disease
was similar to that of adjuvant controls (58.2 Æ 0.6%,
N ¼ 3). Forced exercise preconditioning did not signifi-
cantly alter the distribution of circulating CD4þ lympho-
cytes (57.5 Æ 2.4%, N ¼ 5) or alter the distribution of
circulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (20.9 Æ 0.6%, N ¼ 5
vs. 23.0 Æ 1.1%, N ¼ 6 sedentary EAN rats). Subset ana-
lysis of CD4þ lymphocytes showed, however, that at peak
of disease, sedentary EAN rats exhibited a modest
increase in circulating CD4þ CD212þ (Th

(4.0 Æ 0.9%, N ¼ 3). In contrast, the distribution of circu-
lating Th

tioned rats was similar (3.6 Æ 0.8%, N ¼ 5) to that of
adjuvant controls. The distribution of circulating CD4þ
CD278þ (Th

however, not significantly altered by forced exercise pre-
conditioning (7.6 Æ 1.3%, N ¼ 5), arguing against an
exercise-inducible shift in Th

Subset analysis of CD4þ lymphocytes in popliteal
lymph nodes harvested at disease onset from sedentary
EAN rats revealed an approximate 2.5-fold increase in
retained Th
1 lymphocytes percentage distribution com-
pared with nodes harvested from adjuvant control rats
(Table 1). In contrast, the distribution of Th
1 lympho-
cytes present in nodes harvested at disease onset from
forced-exercise preconditioned rats was similar to that
of adjuvant controls (Table 1). A qualitatively similar
effect of forced exercise preconditioning was seen with
Th
1 lymphocytes recovered from nodes at peak of disease
(Table 2) or from spleen (data not shown). The distribu-
tion of Th
2 lymphocytes (7­10%) and that of cytotoxic
T lymphocytes ($20%) present in nodes (Tables 1 and 2)
or spleen (data not shown) from EAN rats was similar to
that of adjuvant controls and remained unaltered by
forced exercise preconditioning.
Discussion
In this study, we show that preconditioning with forced
exercise elicits a novel and sustained attenuation of EAN,
in part, by altering the composition and egress of auto-
reactive pro-inflammatory (Th
1) lymphocytes from drain-
ing popliteal lymph nodes. Compared with sedentary
controls, forced exercise preconditioning promoted a sus-
tained twofold retention of P2-antigen-responsive leuko-
cytes within popliteal lymph nodes. The percentage
distribution of Th
1 lymphocytes retained in nodes from
sedentary EAN rats was significantly greater than that
present in nodes from forced-exercise preconditioned
EAN rats or that of adjuvant controls. An exercise-indu-
cible shift in Th
1:Th
2 cell bias, however, is not supported
as the percentage of anti-inflammatory (Th
2) lymphocytes
and that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes remained unaltered
by forced exercise preconditioning.
Previously, we reported that forced exercise (treadmill
running, 1.2 km/day Â 6 weeks) administered to adult
male Lewis rats prior to and during the development of
EAN (an established CD4þ T-cell dependent rat model of
human inflammatory demyelinating neuropathies)
affords a novel measure of protection against the devel-
opment of autoimmune-associated deficits in peripheral
nerve function (Calik et al., 2012). The mechanism by

which forced exercise protects against EAN-induced
peripheral nerve injury appeared unrelated to steroid-
induced immune suppression, as total plasma cortico-
sterone content was reduced by 46%, while the levels of
circulating corticosteroid binding globulin were elevated.
Given the importance of systemic inflammation as a
recognized risk factor in several subacute or chronic dis-
eases, including autoimmune disorders, we determined
whether forced exercise elicits protection against EAN
by altering P2-antigen-induced adaptive autoimmune
responses.
A single immunizing dose of CFA-emulsified neurito-
genic P2 antigen administered to the footpad of adult male
Lewis rats elicits a robust and reproducible immune
response that culminates in the development and progres-
sion of EAN. This, however, produces localized inflamma-
tion that hinders any subsequent physical activity. We
therefore designed this study to determine the effect of
exercise preconditioning on development and progression
of subsequently induced EAN. Although forced-exercise
preconditioning did not alter the course of EAN, disease
severity was significantly less than that seen with sedentary
controls. While physical exercise is often advocated as a
safe and effective adjunctive therapeutic strategy for the
management of a variety of seemingly diverse disorders,
this is the first report to our knowledge that shows exercise
preconditioning eliciting a sustainable protective effect
against the development of EAN, a well-established
experimental model of an autoimmune inflammatory neu-
rodegenerative disease.
Earlier studies suggest that physical exercise may pro-
tect against subacute or chronic inflammation by actively
suppressing pro-inflammatory innate (Lancaster et al.,
2005) or adaptive (Flynn et al., 2007; Neto et al., 2011)
immune responses. In general, a pro-inflammatory (Th
1)
adaptive immune response is a subsequent acute phase
reaction to an inciting antigen/pathogen. By comparison,
an anti-inflammatory (Th
2) adaptive immune response
serves as a countermeasure to limit Th
1 responses and
thereby facilitate recovery. Exercise may suppress pro-
inflammatory immune responses by enhancing anti-
inflammatory adaptive immunity (McFarlin et al.,
2006). However, findings from this study do not support
a measurable exercise-inducible shift in Th
1:Th
2 cell bias.
Alternatively, exercise preconditioning may elicit a
sustainable protective effect by altering immune function
through the activation of the sympathetic nervous system
(Bellinger et al., 2008). In response to elevated levels of
catecholamines, acute stressors such as exercise produce a
profound, albeit transient, lymphocytosis (Martina et al.,

Representative flow cytometric distribution dot plots of nodal T lymphocytes. Lymphocytes present in popliteal lymph nodes harvested at onset of disease
from sedentary or forced-exercise preconditioned EAN rats were selected by gating according to their forward and side scatter and Th
1 subsets subse-
quently quantified by co-staining with fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies to cell surface markers CD4 and CD212, as indicated. In all cases, isotype
controls were used to quantify and correct for background fluorescence.

1990). Mobilization of T lymphocytes from their sites of
lymphopoiesis, traversing the blood stream, with subse-
quent trafficking into and egress from secondary lymph-
oid organs is well defined and utilizes a range of ligands
and receptors (Springer, 1994; von Andrian and Mackay,
2000). In this study, exercise preconditioning uniquely
elicited a sustained increase in total leukocyte retention
within popliteal lymph nodes. Exercise-retained nodal
leukocytes harvested at onset of disease responded simi-
larly to sedentary controls, proliferating in response to
P2-antigen stimulation and releasing measurable quanti-
ties of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.
At onset of EAN, nodal leukocytes from exercise-
preconditioned rats responded to P2-antigen stimulation
by markedly enhancing IL-10 release. These findings, in
isolation, are consistent with an exercise-inducible pro-
tective shift toward an anti-inflammatory (Th
2) adaptive
immune response. Exercise preconditioning, however, did
not alter P2-antigen-stimulated release of IL-6, TNF-a,
or IFN-g from nodal leukocytes harvested at disease
onset, suggesting that autoreactive Th
1 responsiveness
was preserved. Not surprisingly, P2-responsiveness of
nodal leukocytes harvested from sedentary rats at peak
of disease was negligible and consistent with anergy-asso-
ciated recovery. Unexpectedly, however, nodal leukocytes
harvested at peak of disease from exercise-preconditioned
rats retained their ability to respond to P2 antigen stimu-
lation. Exercise preconditioning appears to have spared
these autoreactive leukocytes from undergoing anergic
silencing.
Although a measurable exercise-inducible shift in
Th
1:Th
2 cell bias is unlikely, a modest increase in the
percentage distribution of retained T helper (Th
; CD4þ)
lymphocytes could be appreciated at EAN onset.
However, this change was not statistically significant.
The average (pooled) percentage distribution of leuko-
cytes retained in popliteal lymph nodes from both seden-
tary and forced-exercise conditioned EAN rats consisted
of 57.3 Æ 2.1% CD4þ lymphocytes and 20.2 Æ 1.2%
CD8þ (cytotoxic) lymphocytes. Subset analysis of
retained CD4þ lymphocytes harvested at disease onset
from sedentary EAN rats, however, revealed a statistic-
ally significant increase in the percentage of pro-inflam-
matory CD4þCD212þ (Th
1) lymphocytes. Qualitatively
similar increases in the percentage distribution of Th
1
lymphocytes were observed in the blood of sedentary
EAN rats. By comparison, preconditioning with forced
exercise limited EAN-induced increases in nodal and cir-
culating Th
1 lymphocytes without altering the percentage
distribution of retained or circulating Th
2 lymphocytes or
activated cytotoxic (Tc
) lymphocytes. While these find-
ings are consistent with EAN being predominantly a
Th
1 cell-mediated autoimmune peripheral nerve disorder,
the pathogenesis of Guillain-Barre
´ Syndrome (GBS) most
likely involves an imbalance between pro-inflammatory
(Th
1, Th
17) and anti-inflammatory (Th
2, T regulatory)
subsets of CD4þ T cells (Zhang et al., 2013). In our
hands, the percentage distribution of Th
17 CD4þ
lymphocytes retained in popliteal lymph nodes of EAN
rats was negligible (data not shown). Given previous find-
ings showing a selective role of regulatory T lymphocytes
in EAN recovery (Zhang et al., 2009), the distribution of
Tregs at EAN onset and peak was not evaluated in this
study.
While the molecular basis for these observations
remains unclear, exercise-induced activation of sympa-
thetic noradrenergic responses may alter nodal egress of
effector T-cells (Novotny and Kliche, 1986). More
recently, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors have
emerged as key regulators of lymphocyte egress. S1P
receptor activation elicits marked immunosuppression
by sequestering effector T lymphocytes within draining
lymph nodes (Rosen et al., 2003). In vivo application of
the prodrug FTY720, a S1P analog, attenuates the devel-
opment and severity of EAN (Papadopoulos et al., 2010;
Galicia-Rosas et al., 2012). Moreover, FTY720 was
reported to reduce the nodal content of Foxp3þ lympho-
cytes while increasing the appearance of circulating
Foxp3þ lymphocytes in rats recovering from EAN
(Zhang et al., 2009). Interestingly, physical exercise is
reported to increase plasma levels of S1P (Baranowski
et al., 2011; Banitalebi et al., 2013). It remains possible
that forced exercise preconditioning elicits protection by
enhancing S1P-mediated mobilization of regulatory T
cells. Further studies are required to determine whether
exercise preconditioning limits egress of functionally
competent effector T cells while mobilizing regulator T
cells from draining lymph nodes in response to elevated
plasma levels of S1P.
Here, we report that preconditioning with forced exer-
cise elicits a sustained attenuation of EAN severity, in
part, by attenuating egress of functionally competent
autoreactive pro-inflammatory lymphocytes without sig-
nificantly altering Th
1:Th
2 cell bias. An unexpected obser-
vation was the ability of exercise preconditioning to delay
or prevent silencing of retained autoreactive leukocytes.
While exercise-induced immunosuppression may repre-
sent a sustainable adjunctive therapeutic intervention
for the management of inflammatory disorders, add-
itional experimental and phase studies are required to
elucidate mechanistic causality and clinical efficacy.
