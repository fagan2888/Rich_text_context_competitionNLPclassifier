ABSTRACT
Background. Documented trends in health-related risk behaviors among US
adolescents have remained high over time. Studies indicate relationships among
mutual friends are a major influence on adolescents' risky behaviors. Social
Network Analysis (SNA) can help understand friendship ties affecting individual
adolescents' engagement in these behaviors. Moreover, a systematic literature review
can synthesize findings from a range of studies using SNA, as well as assess these
studies' methodological quality. Review findings also can help health educators and
promoters develop more effective programs.
Objective. This review systematically examined studies of the influence of friendship
networks on adolescents' risk behaviors, which utilized SNA and the Add Health data
(a nationally representative sample).
Methods. We employed the Matrix Method to synthesize and evaluate 15 published
studies that met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, retrieved from the Add Health
website and 3 major databases (Medline, Eric, and PsycINFO). Moreover, we
assigned each study a methodological quality score (MQS).
Results. In all studies, friendship networks among adolescents promoted their risky
behaviors, including drinking alcohol, smoking, sexual intercourse, and marijuana
use. The average MQS was 4.6, an indicator of methodological rigor (scale: 1­9).
Conclusion. Better understanding of risky behaviors influenced by friends can be
useful for health educators and promoters, as programs targeting friendships might
be more effective. Additionally, the overall MQ of these reviewed studies was good, as
average scores fell above the scale's mid-point.

INTRODUCTION
The US Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) has captured trends in health-related risk
behaviors among adolescents in grades 9 to 12 between 1991­2011 (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2012c). In the report, the number of adolescents who "had
sexual intercourse with four or more persons (15.3%)" (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2012d), and "used chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip on school property on at least
1 day (7.7%)" demonstrated a general increase (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
How to cite this article Jeon and Goodson (2015), US adolescents' friendship networks and health risk behaviors: a systematic review of
studies using social network analysis and Add Health data. PeerJ 3:e1052; DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052
2012e). On the other hand, the number of those who "ever had at least one drink of alcohol
on at least 1 day" showed a slight decrease from 72.5% to 70.8% during that time (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012a).
Based on these data, we asked: "What may have shaped these trends over time?" In
attempts to answer this question, researchers have indicated that risky health behaviors
among adolescents are strongly influenced by their peers or friendship relationships
(Hall & Valente, 2007; Prinstein, Brechwald & Cohen, 2011; Rew & Horner, 2003). Despite
this knowledge, the literature on health risk behavior during adolescence has focused,
traditionally, on individual adolescent risk taking behaviors (e.g., whether adolescents
engaged in smoking, drinking or sexual activity, as well as frequency or intensity
of engagement) as the unit of analysis. More recently, however, advanced analytical
methodologies--including Social Network Analysis (SNA)--have led to the study of
patterns in health risk behaviors influenced by peer or social contexts (e.g., friendship
networks and affiliations).
Assessing patterns has highlighted the utility of SNA for in-depth understanding of
the risky health behaviors among adolescents based on their relationships or interactions
with other peers (Ennett et al., 2006; Haas, Schaefer & Kornienko, 2010). SNA is an optimal
research tool because SNA maps out relationship networks among different people in a
social group context (Valente, Gallaher & Mouttapa, 2004). Additionally, utilizing SNA,
researchers can describe the patterns of structural connectivity using a visual analysis of
the networks or by generating statistical descriptions (Crnovrsanin et al., 2014). Therefore,
SNA can help understand various risk behaviors that can be affected by other people
(Smith & Christakis, 2008) and can help researchers assess adolescents' risky behaviors
within peer networks, as well as identify the structures of friendship ties that can influence
behaviors.
In the US over the last decade, researchers have studied peer effects upon adolescents'
health risk behaviors using network structure data from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health to Adult Health (Add Health). The Add Health study gathers data
on adolescents' health risk behaviors from a stratified sample of high schools (grades
7­12) nationwide, thus generating representative data. Furthermore, the Add Health
data focus on social contexts (i.e., friendships and family relationships) that influence
adolescents' health-related behaviors (Harris et al., 2009). Data are collected from
in-school questionnaires and in-home interviews with adolescents, their peers, parents,
and school administrators (Harris et al., 2009).
Several researchers have analyzed the Add Health data using social network analysis,
demonstrating that SNA is a useful method for assessing both the structure of peer
relationships, and/or friendship networks (Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a; Mundt, 2011). These
studies indicate that either friendship ties or peer effects among adolescents can function as
causal factors directly influencing peers' risk behaviors such as drinking and smoking. Also,
peer influences affect behaviors both positively and negatively, depending on adolescents'
perceptions of friends' behaviors (Sieving et al., 2006). Despite its valuable contribution,
research utilizing Add Health data varies in focus, with researchers examining many

different types of friendships and various adolescent behaviors, such as drinking, tobacco
use, and sexual intercourse.
The purpose of this study, therefore, is to answer the following questions through
systematically reviewing the extant literature: (1) Which risky health behaviors have been
examined using SNA and the Add Health data; (2) What findings have been identified in
this literature relevant to friendship networks' impact on adolescents' risk behaviors; and
(3) What is the methodological quality of this body of literature?
Systematic literature reviews contribute to a body of literature by organizing and
assessing scientific findings to effectively demonstrate both the accuracy and reliability
of evidenced-based information (Mullen & Ramirez, 2006; Mulrow, 1994). A long-term
goal of this review is to lend further validity to applying SNA as a method for studying
adolescents' health-risk behaviors and assist future researchers in developing guidelines for
implementing network-based intervention programs.
BACKGROUND
National data, collected every two years by the YRBS and hosted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), report that risky behaviors including tobacco
use, drinking alcohol, and sexual intercourse at a young age have been health concerns for
US adolescents for more than 20 years. For instance, between 18 and 47% of adolescents
in grades 9 through 12 engaged in smoking , drinking alcohol, or were involved in sexual
activity in 2011 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012c).
These behaviors are the main health challenges for adolescents because continued risky
behaviors are associated with increasing health problems. Previous studies have indicated
that smoking and drinking alcohol at an early age can lead to poor health, an increased risk
for alcoholism (Englund et al., 2008), and chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular and cancer)
(Sawyer et al., 2007). Moreover, early sexual activity among adolescents can increase the
risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs) (Kaestle et al., 2005) and the
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (Parillo et al., 2001).
In addition, researchers have reported that if adolescents are involved in a risk behavior,
they are more likely to engage in different risk behaviors simultaneously. Johnson et al.
(2000), for instance, identified a correlation between tobacco use and alcohol consumption
among adolescents. Authors found adolescents who smoke are more likely to engage in
binge drinking, simultaneously. Likewise, adolescents used to drinking heavily are more
likely also to smoke regularly.
Sexual behavior
Adolescents who engage in unprotected sexual behaviors have a considerably higher risk of
experiencing an unintended pregnancy or contracting STIs, including HIV (Tapert et al.,
2001), than those who do not engage in these behaviors. As of 2011, the YRBS reported that
the percentage of adolescents (grades 9 through 12) responding positively to the question
"ever had sexual intercourse" was 47.4% (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2012d). Although this percentage is high, it represents a decline: in 1991, more than half
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 3/29
(54.1%) of adolescents in grades 9 through 12 reported that they had engaged in sexual
intercourse.
Due to its many negative health and psychosocial consequences (not the least of which
are sexual abuse and statutory rape), having had sexual intercourse before the age of 13 is
another problematic behavior among adolescents. Rates for this behavior have plateaued
between 2001 and 2009 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012d), and have
dropped 4% (from 10.2% to 6%) compared to 1991.
Alcohol use
In the United States, alcohol use by adolescents is illegal (under age 21) and also remains
a public health problem because it is associated with different risk behaviors, including
tobacco use and unprotected sexual intercourse. Data from the YRBS documents that,
in 2011, an estimated 70.8% of adolescents reported they "ever had at least one drink of
alcohol on at least 1 day" during their lifetime (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2012a). This statistic shows the percentage fell 11% compared to 1991.
By 2011, 38.7% of adolescents reported that they had "had at least one drink of alcohol
on at least 1 day" during the 30 days before the survey (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2012a). This percentage dropped from 50.8% in 1991, a 12% decrease.
Tobacco use
Smoking is related to morbidity and mortality, and is a leading cause of chronic diseases
(e.g., cardiac disease and vascular disease). Although smoking under the age of 18 years
is illegal in the US (US Food and Drug Administration, 2014), data from the YRBS in
2011 indicate that 44.7% of teens reported they "had tried cigarette smoking" (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2012e). This rate has fallen by 25% since 1991 (70.1%).
Another problematic smoking behavior among adolescents (i.e., "smoked cigarettes on
at least 1 day") when assessed in 2011, indicated 18.1% were smokers (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2012e). This rate has fallen 9.4% since 1991 (from 27.5%). While
during the period 1991­1997 the rates had gradually increased to 36.8%, the numbers have
steadily decreased during between1999 and 2011.
Marijuana and cocaine use
For adolescents, marijuana and cocaine use can cause unexplained changes in personality
or attitudes such as anxiety, poor social skills, interpersonal alienation, and poor impulse
control. These drugs also can affect physical development (e.g., brain and nerve damage,
respiratory problems, and blood pressure) (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2014a; Brook,
Balka & Whiteman, 1999; Shedler & Block, 1990; Volkow et al., 2014). Moreover, they can
lead adolescents to other risky behaviors (e.g., sexual intercourse or drinking alcohol).
Marijuana and cocaine use are illegal for adolescents in the US (National Institute on
Drug Abuse, 2014b), yet in 2011, 39.9% of adolescents reported, in the YRBS, ever using
marijuana "one or more times" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012b). This
rate has steadily increased by 8.6% since 1991. Between 1991 and 1999 the increase was
even larger, from 31.3% to 47.2%.
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 4/29
During that same time-period, an estimated 6.8% of adolescents reported they "ever
used any form of cocaine one or more times" (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2012b). Moreover, from 1991 to 1999, the rates had slightly increased (5.9% to 9.5%).
METHODS
To examine whether friendship networks on influence adolescents' risk behaviors in
studies utilizing SNA and Add Health data, we adopted Garrard's Matrix Method to search
the literature and qualitatively synthesize study findings (Garrard, 2010). We searched
publications that specifically used the Add Health data, catalogued by the website for
the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health in Carolina Population
Center at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. However, because the search engine
in the website was limited, it became necessary to identify additional articles through
other electronic bibliographies. We identified and retrieved, therefore, all peer-reviewed
journal articles housed in three additional electronic databases (Medline, Eric, and
PsycINFO), and searched using variations of MeSH terms combined with Boolean
operators (e.g., sexual behavior, drinking behavior, adolescent, and, social network, or
network analysis). Additionally, we searched reference lists from each study, for additional
articles. Using the Scopus database, we conducted further searches based on the first and
corresponding author(s)' names listed in the retrieved reports.
Searching databases for this review initially yielded 4,455 results. Of these, 2,147 were
identified in the Add Health website, 2,240 in Medline, and 68 in Eric and PsycINFO.
After identifying irrelevant topics and removing duplicates in an initial screening step,
we identified 87 relevant studies. Among these, 73 were excluded based on our criteria.
To be included in our review studies needed to: (1) be published in a peer-reviewed
journal between 2003 and 2014; (2) be written in English; (3) use SNA to study friendship
networks' influence on adolescents' risky health behaviors; (4) focus on adolescents (aged
12 to 18 years old) in grades 7 through 12 (as these are the grades utilized in the Add
Health data); and (5) utilize the Add Health data. We excluded studies if (1) only abstracts
were published; (2) articles did not use SNA to study adolescents' risky health behaviors;
(3) studies employed SNA, but did not utilize the Add Health data; (4) studies focused
on the relationship between friendships and adolescents risky behaviors; and (5) studies
employed hypothetical models or simulation modeling to examine the Add Health data.
Thus, we identified 14 articles eligible for full-text review. Moreover, we retrieved
1 additional article through retrieved studies' reference lists, and through first and
corresponding author searches in Scopus. This study was published in 2001, but we
included it in this review, because it met our other criteria. Finally, 15 articles met our
inclusion criteria, and became the final sample in this review (see Fig. 1 as an adapted
PRISMA flow diagram) (Moher et al., 2009).
Subsequently, we employed a review matrix to organize the information extracted
from each article. The review matrix (see Table 1) included information for each study
on: authors, sample, focal variables (behaviors studied), purpose, use of theory, statistical
analyses, key findings, and suggesting prevention/intervention programs.

Figure 1 PRISMA flow diagram of reviewed studies.
We assessed each article's methodological quality employing a numerical score that
reflects specific features of a study's design and analyses (Goodson, Buhi & Dunsmore,
2006; Jeon, Chen & Goodson, 2012). In this review, each study received a methodological
quality score (MQS), reflecting its performance on the criteria outlined in Table 2, to
include: whether studies examined a single or multiple risk behaviors; if studies utilized an
established theoretical framework; if the report contained visualizations of the networks;
if the report presented visualizations of the analysis; if the study tested specific hypothesis;
if the report explained the types of data analysis employed; and whether researchers made
recommendations for developing programs, based on their findings. The scores ranged
from 1 to 9 with a higher value representing better methodological quality.
RESULTS
Studies' characteristics
Fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. Most studies (n = 14) were conducted in the
US, and one paper, in France. Most reviewed studies (n = 11) were published between
2009 and 2014, perhaps because social network analysis only recently became popular as
an analytical tool. Even though network data were collected in Wave I of the Add Health

"The influence through clubs had a significant effect on any
drinking (AOR = 1.46; p < .01), but only a marginal effect on
frequent drinking (AOR = 1.23; p < .1). These results indicate
that adolescents exposed to drinkers in their sports or clubs
were more likely to drink themselves, but the effect on frequent
drinking was stronger in a sports context than in a club one"
"The friends' exposure had a significant effect on both
any drinking and frequent drinking (AOR = 1.55;

friends who drink were more likely to drink themselves"
"The affiliation influence through sports members who were also

survey (1994­1995), we found the earliest publication on social networks among the
reviewed studies was published in 2001.
All reviewed studies appeared in journals with impact factors ranging from 1.638 to
4.266. Four were published in the Journal of Adolescent Health, and two studies were
published in Addictive Behaviors. The other journals (the American Sociological Review,
the American Journal of Public Health, Health Psychology, Developmental Psychology, Social
Science & Medicine, Academic Pediatrics, the Journal of Adolescence, the Journal of Health
Economics, and Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health) published one report each.
Studies' findings
1) Which adolescents' risky health behaviors have been examined using SNA and the Add
Health data?
The studies in this review utilized SNA to examine adolescents' substance use--
drinking, smoking, and marijuana use--and sexual behavior--specifically, sexual
intercourse.
Eight studies examined adolescents' alcohol consumption behaviors, focusing on
different aspects of adolescents' drinking (Ali & Dwyer, 2010; Clark & Loh´
eac, 2007;
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 15/29
Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a; Fujimoto & Valente, 2012b; Fujimoto & Valente, 2013; Jaccard,
Blanton & Dodge, 2005; Kreager & Haynie, 2011; Mundt, 2011). Among these reports, six
studied adolescents' drinking frequency as affected by best (or close) friends, peer group,
affiliated members (e.g., sports and club activities), or direct (and indirect) friends (Ali
& Dwyer, 2010; Clark & Loh´
eac, 2007; Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a; Fujimoto & Valente,
2012b; Fujimoto & Valente, 2013; Mundt, 2011). Moreover, two studies (Jaccard, Blanton
& Dodge, 2005, and Kreager & Haynie, 2011) investigated adolescents' level of drinking
(specifically, bingeing) as influenced by friends.
In the six studies focused on drinking frequency, researchers used various questions from
the Add Health questionnaires, including: "During the past 12 months, on how many days
did you drink alcohol?" and "Think of all the times you have had a drink during the past
12 months, how many drinks did you usually have each time?"; "Over the past 12 months,
on how many days have you gotten drunk or `very, very high' on alcohol?"; and "During
the past 12 months, how often did you get drunk?" In the two studies examining level of
drinking (specifically, bingeing), researchers used the following questions: "Over the past
twelve months, on how many days did you drink five or more drinks in a row?" Both the
adolescents and their friends were asked this question.
Seven studies focused on cigarette use or smoking behaviors among adolescents
(Alexander et al., 2001; Ali & Dwyer, 2009; Clark & Loh´
eac, 2007; Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a;
Fujimoto & Valente, 2012b; Lakon, Hipp & Timberlake, 2010; Pollard et al., 2010). All seven
examined adolescents' frequency of smoking as influenced by various friendships, such as
close or best friends, popular friends, mutual friends, or direct (and indirect) friends.
In these seven studies, authors used various questionnaire items, including: "During the
past 30 days (past 12 months), on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?"; "During the
past 30 days, on the days you smoked, how many cigarettes did you smoke each day?"; or
"Of your 3 best friends, how many smoke at least 1 cigarette a day?"
Three studies investigated sexual behavior (intercourse) (Ali & Dwyer, 2011; Jaccard,
Blanton & Dodge, 2005; Sieving et al., 2006). These studies examined the frequency of sexual
intercourse as being influenced by close friends. Researchers used the questions: "Have you
ever had sexual intercourse?"; "In what month and year did you have sexual intercourse
most recently?"; or "If you had sexual intercourse, your friends would respect you more"
from a section on "Motivations to Engage in Risky Behaviors."
Two studies (Clark & Loh´
eac, 2007; Tucker et al., 2014) focused on adolescents' mari-
juana use as influenced by peer groups. In this study, researchers used the questionnaire
item: "During the past 30 days, how many times did you use marijuana?" In these studies,
authors examined the frequency of marijuana use as influenced by adolescents' friendships.
Even though the Add Health questionnaires have items addressing two different
behaviors in tandem (e.g., sexual intercourse + drinking; and sexual intercourse + drugs),
none of the reviewed studies examined more than one behavior at a time.
(2) What research findings have been identified in the literature relevant to friendship
networks' impact on adolescents' risk behaviors?
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 16/29
Alcohol use
As mentioned previously, eight reviewed studies investigated the relationship between
drinking alcohol and friendship networks (drinking frequency and amount of drinking).
For instance, the study conducted by Fujimoto & Valente (2012a) examined how various
friendship types influenced adolescents' substance use, including drinking (frequency).
Authors classified three types of friendships: mutual friendships, directional friendships,
and intimate friendships (see Fig. 2 for diagrams of the three types of friendships examined
by Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a). A mutual friendship was defined as reciprocated friends
(knowing each other as friends). A directional friendship was defined as an unreciprocated
nomination that originated either from an ego or from an alter (i.e., ego-nominating
friend and alter-nominating friend). An intimate friendship was defined as closest or best
friends who were being first nominated (Fig. 2). These three friendship types were based on
friendship nominations that students were asked to make as they nominated five best male
friends and five best female friends from the Add Health data.
Fujimoto & Valente (2012a) found mutual friends were more likely to influence their
friends' drinking behavior (frequency) than a directional friendship in the previous year
(AOR = 2.07; p < 0.001). Moreover, in the directional friendships among unreciprocated
alters, the authors found ego-nominating friends (Fig. 2) were slightly more influential in
adolescents' drinking behavior than alter-nominating friends (AOR = 2.02; p < 0.001).
Paradoxically, for the intimate relationships (Fig. 2), the study indicated that non-best
friends were more likely to influence adolescents' past year drinking than best friends (AOR
= 2.62; p < 0.001).
Fujimoto & Valente (2013) also examined the influence on adolescents' drinking (and
drinking frequency) of friends and affiliated members in sports and club activities.
Adolescents were asked in which school organized clubs or sports they participated. Based
on this information, authors divided activities into 12 types of sports and clubs, such as
playing chess, studying French, and basketball.
Moreover, Fujimoto & Valente (2013) categorized friendships as (1) all nominated
friends (adolescent nominated the alter as a friend, the equivalent to "directional
friendships" in Fig. 2), and (2) only reciprocated friends (both adolescents mutually called
each other friends) (Fig. 2). Fujimoto & Valente (2013) then created affiliation models
based on nominated friends (i.e., General affiliation--the influence from all members'
friendships; Nominated-friends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who were
nominated as friends; and Nonfriends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who
were not nominated friends). Affiliation models based on reciprocated friends were
also developed (i.e., General affiliation--the influence from all members' friendships;
Reciprocated-friends' affiliation--the influence from adolescents who had at least
one reciprocated friend; and Nonreciprocated-friends' affiliation--the influence of a
nonreciprocated friend).
In the nominated friends' general affiliation model, sports members influenced adoles-
cents' drinking and frequency of drinking (AOR = 1.20; p < 0.05), and club members
only affected adolescents' drinking (AOR = 1.46; p < 0.01). This study additionally

Mutual/Reciprocated friendships. (B) Directional friendships: Outdegree is the number of friendship
ties that the ego who is a focal point within a network "sends" & Indegree is the number of friendship

close friends by A; C­F were nominated as friends, but not best or close friends.

demonstrated that friends who drink were also more likely to affect adolescents' drinking
and drinking frequency (AOR = 1.55; p < 0.001). In the nominated-friends' affiliation
model, this study indicated club members significantly influenced adolescents' drinking
and drinking frequency (AOR = 1.15; p < 0.01) (Fujimoto & Valente, 2013). In the
nonfriends' affiliation model, club members who were not friends were more likely
to affect drinking and drinking frequency of adolescents (AOR = 1.37; p < 0.01). In
the reciprocated friends' affiliation model, sports members who were mutual friends
with adolescents significantly influenced drinking and frequent drinking (AOR = 1.16;
p < 0.01). Moreover, club members who were mutual friends were more influential
in adolescents' drinking and frequency of drinking (AOR = 1.22; p < 0.001) than the
results based on the nominated-friends affiliation model (p < 0.01). Additionally, in the
nonreciprocated friends' affiliation model, club members significantly influenced drinking
and drinking frequency of adolescents (AOR = 1.25; p < 0.05) (Fujimoto & Valente, 2013).
Uniquely, this study showed that club members who have no friendship ties with others
influenced other adolescents' drinking behavior within the affiliation friendship networks.
This finding can be explained by the fact that club members do not need to be intimate
friends to be connected to each other, because they share many common interests and
behaviors, even if they are not friends.
In another study, Jaccard, Blanton & Dodge (2005) evaluated how close friends influence
adolescents' binge drinking. In this study, close friends were defined as those who were
nominated by adolescents. Authors found a statistical significance in the behavioral
similarity (binge drinking) between adolescents and their close friends ((unstandardized
regression coefficient) 0.15; p < 0.006). Additionally, the study demonstrated that when
adolescents' drinking behavior changed between Wave I (1995) and Wave II (1996) of data
collection, their close friends' binge drinking also changed accordingly during the same
time period ((unstandardized regression coefficient) 0.12; p < 0.05).
The other five studies showed similar findings, indicating that friendships that matter,
among adolescents, were more likely to exert influence upon adolescents' drinking
behavior. For instance, among these five studies, Clark & Loh´
eac (2007) found that "if
participation in drinking alcohol by the male peer group in the same school year increases
by 25%, the adolescent's probability of drinking alcohol increases 4.5%" (p. 773). Likewise,
the study by Ali & Dwyer (2010) showed that if the number of close friends who drink
increased by 10%, other adolescents' drinking would increase by 2%. Authors also found
"a 10% increase in drinking among grade-level peers ...associated with a 4% increase in
individual drinking" (p. 340).
Tobacco use
Seven of the fifteen studies reported friendship influence on adolescents' frequency of
smoking. For instance, Ali & Dwyer (2009) categorized peer network as not only close
friends who were nominated by the adolescents, but also those who were classmates and
others from the same grade in school. A key finding from the study was that "having
up to 25 percentage of close friends as smokers increases the probability of smoking by
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 19/29
5% ...whereas being in a class containing up to 25% smokers increases the likelihood of
smoking by 10%" (p. 406).
In another study, Fujimoto & Valente (2012b) investigated the influence of peer networks
on adolescent's substance use (smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol), based on
contagion mechanisms, in terms of cohesion and structural equivalence. Cohesion referred
to relationships within a network, for which there are direct ties or exchange of influence.
Structural equivalence referred to relationships among adolescents who occupy similar
positions as others within friendship networks (see Fig. 3 for diagrams of cohesion and
structural equivalence in a network). Authors defined peers as those who were nominated
by friends. In their analysis, they utilized a network exposure model to assess both cohesion
and structural equivalence measuring peers' risk taking in terms of social distances (at four
steps away from other adolescents--friends of friends of friends of friends). The results
indicated "the odds ratios for cohesion exposures to smoking were statistically significant
up to distance two (but not significant for distances greater than two) with the highest
magnitude at distance one (OR = 1.50; p < 0.001), followed by distance two (OR = 1.40;
p < 0.001)" (p. 1957).
These findings suggest that direct or indirect friends (a friend or the friend of a friend)
were more likely to influence adolescents' smoking behavior than friends at distance three
or four (the friend(1)-of-a-friend(2)-of-a-friend(3), or the friend(1)-of-a-friend(2)-of-a-
friend(3)-of-a-friend(4)). Moreover, the researchers found that for structural equivalence
exposure to smoking, "...exposure effects were statistically significant for all distances with
the highest in magnitude at distance one (OR = 1.99; p < 0.001), followed by distance
two (OR = 1.83; p < 0.001), distance three (OR = 1.59; p < 0.001) and distance four
(OR = 1.59; p < 0.001)" (Fujimoto & Valente, 2012b, p. 1957). These findings suggest that
adolescents, who were one and two steps away in the network structure, were more likely to
affect adolescents' smoking behavior than adolescents at three or four steps away in terms
of social distances.
The other five studies showed similar results, namely, that various close friendships,
such as best, popular, and mutual friends, were more likely to influence adolescents'
smoking behavior than non-close friends. For instance, Alexander et al. (2001) indicated
that if adolescents have best friends who are cigarette smokers, those adolescents'
probability of smoking increases two fold. Similarly, the study conducted by Pollard et
al. (2010) demonstrated that "...a greater number of one's best friends (who) smoked, and
increases in the perceived number of best friends who smoked over a one-year period, were
associated with greater odds of an adolescent being [a smoker]..." (p. 682).
Sexual intercourse
Three studies focused on how adolescents' friendships influence each other's sexual
behavior (specifically, intercourse). For instance, Sieving et al. (2006) classified close friends
as those who were being nominated. Close friends were based on friendship nominations
by students who were asked to nominate best male and female friends. Researchers found

that "...for every 1% increase in sexually experienced friends at Wave I (1995), the odds
that young people initiated sex by Wave 2 (1996) increased by 1%" (p. 17).
In another study, Ali & Dwyer (2011) defined peer group as not only close friends who
were nominated by adolescents, but also those who were classmates and others from the
same grade in school. In this study, they found that if the number of close friends initiating
sex increased by 10%, an adolescent's probability of initiating sex would also increase
by 5%.
The third study (Jaccard, Blanton & Dodge, 2005), showed similar findings, indicating
that close friends were more likely to exert influence on adolescents to engage in sex. They
found "...of target individuals whose closest friends engaged in sexual activity across the
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 21/29
two waves (Waves I and II), 56% also engaged in sexual intercourse across the waves"
(p. 141).
All reviewed studies examining sexual behaviors examined single behaviors; examined
two or more behaviors in tandem, such as sexual activity with alcohol consumption, even
though the Add Health data contains this information.
Marijuana use
Among the 15 studies reviewed, two examined the influence of friendship networks on
adolescent's marijuana use. Tucker et al. (2014) examined how different types of friendships
(i.e., friend reciprocity, friend popularity, and popularity difference) affected adolescents'
marijuana use in two saturated schools samples (i.e., school 1 and 2) at Wave I and
II. Friend reciprocity was defined as mutual friends (being nominated by each other
as friends). Friend popularity was defined based on "the total number of friendship
nominations received by a nominated friend at a given wave..." (p. 68). Popularity
difference was defined as "the difference in number of friend nominations received..." (p.
68). Researchers found that two friendships (i.e., reciprocity and friend popularity) were
more likely to influence adolescents' marijuana use. Regarding friend reciprocity, authors
found "in school 1, there was a significant positive interaction between friends' influence
on marijuana use and friend reciprocity...adolescents tended to adopt the (marijuana) use
behaviors of their mutual friends..." (p. 72). For friend popularity, the researchers found
that there was only statistical significance in school 2, indicating popular friends were more
likely to influence adolescents' marijuana use.
The second study, conducted by Clark & Loh´
eac (2007), examined peer group effects on
adolescents' alcohol, smoking and marijuana use. However, in this study, authors did not
find that friendships influenced adolescents' marijuana use.
(3) What is the methodological quality of this body of literature?
As previously mentioned, we assigned a methodological quality score (MQS--with a
possible range of 1 to 9 points) to each reviewed study. Table 2 presents the distribution of
reviewed studies in terms of the MQS criteria. The average MQS was 4.6 (SD = 1.24), with
actual scores ranging from 2 to 7 points. Among the 15 studies, seven (46.7%) scored below
4.5. The main problems affecting studies scoring below average were lack of visuals for the
networks and/or for the analyses.
Eleven reviewed studies (73.3%) focused on studying a single behavior (most com-
monly, smoking or drinking). Four studies (26.7%) analyzed two or more behaviors, such
as alcohol and tobacco use, but each behavior was examined separately. None examined
two or more risk behaviors simultaneously (e.g., sexual intercourse with drug or alcohol
consumption).
Regarding using or adopting theoretical frameworks, while the majority (10 studies)
employed a theoretical framework, five studies (33.3%) failed to do so. Among the
10 studies employing a theoretical framework, six (40%) provided some theoretical
explanation or rationale and four studies (26.7%) presented a scientific or behavioral
theory: Social Learning Theory and Social Comparison Theory. Eight studies (53.3%)
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 22/29
did not test a hypothesis. Seven reports (46.7%) tested a proposed hypothesis such as
"...influence from mutual friendships has stronger influence on adolescent drinking and
smoking than non-mutual friendships" (Fujimoto & Valente, 2012a, p. 137) or "adolescents
with higher proportions of sexually experienced close friends are more likely to initiate
sexual intercourse than others" (Sieving et al., 2006, p. 14).
Only one reviewed study (6.7%) provided visual graphics for the networks examined,
while four studies (26.7%) provided illustrations for how friendship influences egos
and their alters. Fourteen studies (93.3%) employed and reported both descriptive and
inferential statistics in their data analysis. One study (6.7%) reported only inferential
statistics. More than half of the reviewed studies (66.7%) made recommendations for
prevention or intervention programs, based on their network-related findings. Lakon,
Hipp & Timberlake (2010), for instance, propose in their study: "These friendship pairs
could be targeted for a school-based intervention, either to help both adolescents in a pair
remain nonsmokers or so that they could help each other stop smoking" (p. 1226­1227).
DISCUSSION
This systematic review consolidated a segment of the current research employing SNA
for studying adolescents' health risk behaviors. Specifically, we synthesized findings from
network analyses based on the Add Health data, and assessed each analysis' methodological
quality (presented in Table 2).
In this review, fifteen studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies found that,
in general, various types of friendships exert influence upon adolescents' health risk
behaviors. Across reviewed studies, having friends engaging in risky behaviors is a negative
predictor of adolescents' healthy behaviors or a positive predictor of risky ones.
More than half of the reviewed studies examined friendship network effects on
adolescents' risky behaviors either at a single point in time, or over time. Based on these
studies, we learn that individuals who have friends or are linked to friendship networks
exhibiting risky behaviors (e.g., smoking or alcohol consumption) are at increased risk for
engaging in these behaviors both initially, and over time.
These findings from the Add Health data mirror results from a longitudinal study
conducted in Finland. Mercken et al. (2012) assessed the relationship between substance
use (alcohol consumption) and friendship networks among Finnish adolescents at
different data points (i.e., time 1, time 2, time 3, and time 4). The results demonstrated
that friends with risky drinking behaviors influenced adolescents to engage in similar
drinking behaviors over time (between time 1 and 2). These results indicate, therefore, that
SNA can account for the role of time in risky behaviors with more nuanced information
than traditional longitudinal designs (Rothenberg et al., 1998).
The reviewed studies highlighted that SNA can help researchers better understand the
complex mechanisms underlying the connection between friendships among adolescents
and risky behaviors. Even studies that utilize SNA but are not included in this review
mention SNA is a helpful tool for understanding adolescent behaviors as an outcome
of social relationships, as well as for understanding changes in behaviors and friendship

networks over time (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Luke & Harris, 2007; Mercken et al., 2009;
Smith & Christakis, 2008), because friendship ties and behaviors occur inside the structure
of dynamic interpersonal relationships among adolescents (Steglich, Snijders & Pearson,
2010). For instance, adolescents may choose friends having similar behaviors as theirs, or
they may change their behaviors to develop new friendships or to match the behavior of
existing friends. SNA, thus, can help explain peer selection, as well as lead to modeling
changes in behaviors as a function of ties over time (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Luke &
Harris, 2007; Scott & Carrington, 2011).
In addition, SNA also allows better understanding of phenomena that cannot be
adequately studied with traditional linear analyses. In particular, linear analysis cannot
provide measures of structural linkages among individuals located inside a network, as
a supplement to measures of an individuals' health risk behaviors. Using SNA, however,
researchers are able to account for, and examine network dynamics and structure, such
as density (i.e., the number of actual connections as a function of the total possible
connections in a network) or degree (i.e., the number of ties, in and out, with other
individuals in a network) (Valente, 2010), the impact of a network structure upon
health behaviors, as well as the role of individuals as a function of their placement in
the network. Moreover, SNA can create visualizations, depicting ties among individuals
(Scott & Carrington, 2011; Valente, 2010), showing how an individual's position may act as
a mediator for positive or negative behavioral influences. For instance, the reviewed study
carried by Kreager & Haynie (2011) found that "indirect ties to a drinking peer through
a romantic partner are associated with significantly higher future drinking than is the
drinking of more proximal friends or romantic partners" (p. 756).
When SNA is employed in the study of health behaviors, it can not only identify
structural and relational factors associated with behavioral changes in individuals or
groups, but also provide information that can be used for developing effective network-
based intervention programs to reduce health risk behaviors. In a study conducted by
Valente et al. (2007), for instance, the authors compared changes in adolescents' substance
use (i.e., cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine) between a control group receiving
an evidenced-based prevention program and a network group receiving peer-leader
intervention as a network prevention program. The results indicated that using a
peer-leader program targeting the network was more effective in reducing substance use
after a one-year follow-up assessment.
When assessed for overall methodological quality, the mean MQS for the studies
reviewed herein was 4.6, an indicator of good quality relative to our seven criteria (a
theoretical range of 1­9 points). Although the body of evidence we reviewed exhibits good
methodological quality, because scores fell above the theoretical mid-point of our scale, not
supplying illustrative visualizations showing the connections among individuals in net-
works, the absence of theoretical frameworks, and not examining two or more behaviors in
tandem, affected the overall quality of this body of research, vis-`
a-vis our criteria.
One common weakness was the absence of either graphs depicting the networks or visu-
alizations that could help understand the proposed analyses. Providing visualizations can
Jeon and Goodson (2015), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.1052 24/29
improve the clarity of, and highlight structural relationships within networks, more easily
(Crnovrsanin et al., 2014). For instance, Mundt (2011) depicted a visual network of alcohol
initiators and alcohol abstainers from their sample. The graphics the author provided help
us understand not only the relationship among these adolescents, but guide us to a better
understanding of the network measures themselves (i.e., differences between networks'
density and degree are made more meaningful, when accompanied by a visual aid).
Another methodological weakness we identified was the reviewed studies' lack of a
theoretical framework to examine adolescents' risky behaviors. The absence of a theoretical
framework in research can lead to overlooking of salient factors and examining spurious
ones. Conversely, using a theoretical framework can facilitate identifying possible causes
(Goodson, 2010; Green, 2000). Theory helps develop programs, and findings from studies
that use theory can be useful for determining the type of intervention that best suits risky
behaviors. Understanding of social networks is growing, based on the increasing amounts
of data being collected. Nonetheless, in order to develop effective interventions that target
adolescents' networks, theoretical explanations of the mechanisms affecting behaviors
within a network become even more important. Using available theories of networks,
adolescent development, and structural influences on behavior, researchers can shed light
upon the data they are now collecting and, over time, build the knowledge-base on this
topic.
A further weakness of the reviewed studies was examining behaviors, individually.
Studies focusing on two or more behaviors in tandem would allow for a better holistic
understanding of the role of friendship networks in the dynamics of adolescents' risky
behaviors, given that risk behaviors rarely happen in isolation. There is abundant
evidence documenting adolescents' engagement in multiple risky behaviors carried out
simultaneously. In the review conducted by Cooper (2002), for instance, the author found
that college students who drink alcohol were also involved in having sexual intercourse.
Similar to Cooper's review (2002), a study from Johnson et al. (2000) also identified that
when teens engage in high levels of alcohol consumption, they also were more likely to
smoke.
Similar to the reviewed studies, this review also carries important limitations. First,
despite our attempt to locate all studies employing SNA utilizing the Add Health data, it
is possible our search did not capture all existing studies, given that we limited the search
to published reports. Second, to assess the methodological quality of this literature, we
adopted and created the MQS criteria based on previous systematic reviews. The precise
criteria we use in this review, therefore, have not been tested for their ability to generate
valid and reliable assessments and could, therefore, be biased.
Despite these limitations, this systematic review demonstrated the important role of
friends and friendship networks on adolescents' risky behaviors and the benefit of a SNA
approach for better understanding of this role and its complex mechanisms. Moreover,
this review is unique not only because it lends further validity to SNA as a method, but
also because it synthesizes findings from high quality studies based on a national sample.

network intervention programs to reduce adolescents' risky behaviors.
