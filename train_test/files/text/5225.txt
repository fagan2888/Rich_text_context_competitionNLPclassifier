ABSTRACT
Our understanding of how histone demethylation con-
tributes to the regulation of basal gene expression in the
brain is largely unknown in any injury model, and especially
in the healthy adult brain. Although Jumonji genes are often
regulated transcriptionally, cell-specific gene expression of
Jumonji histone demethylases in the brain remains poorly
understood. Thus, in the present study we profiled the mRNA
levels of 26 Jumonji genes in microglia (CD11b+ ), neurons
(NeuN+ ) and astrocytes (GFAP+ ) from the healthy adult rat
brain. We optimized a method combining a mZBF (modified
zinc-based fixative) and FCM (flow cytometry) to simultane-
ously sort cells from non-transgenic animals. We evaluated
cell-surface, intracellular and nuclear proteins, including his-
tones, as well as messenger- and micro-RNAs in different cell
types simultaneously from a single-sorted sample. We found
that 12 Jumonji genes were differentially expressed between
adult microglia, neurons and astrocytes. While JMJD2D was
neuron-restricted, PHF8 and JMJD1C were expressed in all
three cell types although the expression was highest in neu-
rons. JMJD3 and JMJD5 were expressed in all cell types, but
were highly enriched in microglia; astrocytes had the low-
est expression of UTX and JHDM1D. Levels of global H3K27
(H3 lysine 27) methylation varied among cell types and
appeared to be lowest in microglia, indicating that differ-
ences in basal gene expression of specific Jumonji histone
demethylases may contribute to cell-specific gene expres-
sion in the CNS (central nervous system). This multiparamet-

INTRODUCTION
The CNS (central nervous system) is comprised highly inter-
connected, yet functionally heterogeneous CNS cell popula-
tions. Understanding how these cells function both individu-
ally and within a network is crucial to unraveling their role in
health and disease. Interpretation of many existing epigenetic
and gene regulation studies in the adult CNS are complicated
by the fact that they are typically performed on tissue ho-
mogenates, so the effects within individual cell types cannot
be distinguished. Another major technical hurdle in evaluat-
ing gene expression in vivo is the inability to efficiently isolate
nucleic acids (RNA) from paraformaldehyde-fixed and sorted
cells since major CNS cell types are best characterized by pro-
teins expressed intracellularly. As a result, investigations of
gene regulation in the brain often utilize cultured CNS cells
that are usually derived from late embryonic or neonatal an-
imals, confounding understanding of these processes in the
adult. Laser capture microdissection (Vincent et al., 2002; Luo
et al., 2007), live cell sorting by FCM (flow cytometry) from

S. M. C. Smith and others
transgenic animals expressing fluorescent proteins driven by
cell-type-specific promoters (Lobo et al., 2006), ribosomal-
tagging for mRNA isolation from transgenic animals (Doyle
et al., 2008; Heiman et al., 2008; Sanz et al., 2009), and
alcohol-based fixation to sort neurons for subsequent RNA
analysis (Guez-Barber et al., 2011a) are commonly used meth-
ods permitting assessments of RNA in specific CNS cell pop-
ulations, but each have their own drawbacks. Although each
technique has enabled significant advances in neurobiology,
their limitations include investigations of only a single-cell
type at a time, the need to use and maintain transgenic an-
imals, and/or the inability to concurrently analyze nucleic
acids and intracellular proteins in a single sample. Therefore,
we endeavored to overcome these obstacles by optimizing
a novel method using non-transgenic, adult rats where pro-
teins and nucleic acids can be concurrently analyzed by FCM
in multiple neuron and glial cell types simultaneously iden-
tified using a combination of intracellular and extracellular
markers.
Although FCM is commonly used to analyze and sort pure
cell populations, the ability to efficiently recover nucleic acids
from formaldehyde-fixed cells is not (Diez et al., 1999). This
limitation is particularly significant for neuroscience research
because the best-characterized cell-type-specific markers for
neurons and astrocytes are intracellular, thus requiring fixa-
tion and permeabilization for immunostaining-based detec-
tion. Guez-Barber and colleagues (Guez-Barber et al., 2011a)
reported the use of an alcohol-based fixative to sort neurons
from non-transgenic animals for subsequent RNA analysis,
the utility of which has been demonstrated several times
for evaluating nucleic acids in sorted neurons (Guez-Barber
et al., 2012; Fanous et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). However,
when endeavoring to isolate nucleic acids from identified
and sorted neuron and glial cell populations simultaneously,
based on a combination of intracellular and cell surface iden-
tification markers, alcohol fixation was ineffective in our
studies. We thus turned to a ZBF (zinc-based fixative) which
was previously shown to preserve cellular structure, proteins
and nucleic acids in histological and cellular studies (Wester
et al., 2003; Lykidis et al., 2007; Jensen et al., 2010). Be-
cause a mZBF (modified zinc-based fixative) was previously
shown to preserve nucleic acids better than the standard
zinc fixation methods (Lykidis et al., 2007), we evaluated
intracellular, extracellular and nuclear proteins, as well as
post-translational modifications to histone tails with mZBF
after a mechanical dissociation protocol. We found that all
parameters were readily preserved. Fixed microglia, neurons
and astrocytes were sorted based on the cell surface (CD11b)
and intracellular markers [NeuN (neuronal nuclei) and GFAP
(glial fibrillary acidic protein), respectively], and we obtained
high-quality messenger and small non-coding RNAs [miRNAs
(microRNAs)]. We also observed differences in basal histone
H3K27 (H3 lysine 27) methylation status among cell types,
suggesting fundamental differences in chromatin structure
between CNS cell types. The purity of sorted cell popula-
tions from the adult CNS was confirmed by evaluation of
mRNA levels of cell-type-specific genes in individual cell
populations.
The importance of histone demethylation in the molecu-
lar regulation of CNS gene transcription is becoming increas-
ingly appreciated. Our overall research goal is to understand
the role of histone demethylation in regulating gene tran-
scription in individual CNS cell types (microglia, neurons and
astrocytes), since cell-specific gene regulation strongly con-
tributes to cell­cell communication in CNS health and dis-
ease. Two families of histone demethylases have been identi-
fied: LSD (lysine-specific demethylases) and JmjC (Jumonji C)
domain family proteins (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). Whereas
the Jumonji demethylases comprise the largest gene family
of histone demethylases, little is known about their expres-
sion or function in the adult CNS, in any cell type. To begin
to understand how epigenetic regulation influences CNS cell
function, and because so little is known about the expres-
sion of key Jumonji demethylases in any CNS cell type in the
adult, we used the present method to independently profile
the expression of the 26 best characterized Jumonji histone
demethylase family members in microglia, neurons and astro-
cytes. We found that seven Jumonji genes had greater than a
3-fold change in mRNA expression levels between cell types.
Of these, PHF8, JMJD1C and JMJD2D had neuron-specific
expression, whereas JMJD3 and JMJD5 were primarily ex-
pressed in microglia. UTX and JHDM1D had very low expres-
sion in astrocytes compared to neurons and microglia. Col-
lectively, these data suggest that there is cell-type-specific
regulation of basal histone demethylase expression in the
CNS. Moreover, because these enzymes have different his-
tone targets and enzymatic specificities (Kooistra and Helin,
2012), these results also suggest that histone demethyla-
tion likely plays different functional roles in the control of
gene expression in neurons, astrocytes and microglia in the
healthy brain. The present technique provides a simple ex-
perimental means with which to begin in vivo studies of cell-
specific epigenetic gene regulation in multiple CNS cell types
simultaneously.

HBSS (Hanks balanced salt solution) was purchased from
Cellgro. Calcium acetate, zinc chloride, zinc trifluroacetate,
glycerol, DEPC [diethyl pyrocarbonate (q.v.)], EDTA and TRI
Reagent were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Percoll was
purchased from GE Healthcare. DNase was purchased from
Worthington Biochemicals. Lightning Link Antibody conju-
gation kit was purchased from Novus. Glycoblue reagent
was purchased from Ambion. NCodeTM VILOTM miRNA cDNA
Synthesis kit, RNase AWAY and DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole) were purchased from Invitrogen. Primers were
designed using Primer 3 software and were purchased from
Integrated DNA Technologies. Power SYBR green was pur-
chased from Applied Biosystems. CD11b and GFAP anti-
bodies were purchased from BD Biosciences. NeuN, EAAT2
(excitatory amino-acid transporter 2) [GLT-1 (glutamate

Control of RNAse and DNAse contamination
Special precautions were taken during sample collection
and processing to preserve RNA integrity. Only certified
nuclease-free plastic ware and/or glassware baked at 400C
for 4 h were used. All surfaces and tools were treated
with RNase AWAY (Invitrogen) to prevent RNase contam-
ination. All solutions were prepared with DEPC-treated
water.
Mechanical dissociation and fixation of neural
tissue
Rats were killed with an overdose of isoflurane anesthetic,
and perfused with cold 0.1 M PBS. The brain, excluding ol-
factory bulbs, brainstem and cerebellum was dissected, and
placed into cold HBSS on ice. Samples remained on ice for
the duration of the procedure, and all centrifugation steps
were performed at 4C. We modified a mechanical dissoci-
ation protocol (Chassevent et al., 1984) for creating single-
cell suspensions of CNS tissues by pushing the tissue through
a pre-moistened 100 m filter with a syringe plunger and
flushing the filter with ice-cold HBSS supplemented with
0.01 mg/ml DNase and 0.1 mM EDTA. Myelin was removed
by high-speed centrifugation at 850 g for 15 min in a so-
lution consisting of 26% Percoll in 0.1 M PBS. Dissociated
cells were washed in ice-cold HBSS and pelleted by cen-
trifugation at 350 g for 5 min. Cells were resuspened in a
mZBF (0.5% zinc chloride, 0.5% zinc trifluroacetate, 0.05%
calcium acetate in 0.1 M Tris­HCL, pH 6.4­6.7) and glycerol
(1:1), as previously described (Lykidis et al., 2007; Jensen
et al., 2010). Samples were stored at - 20C overnight or
until ready to be used. Consistent with previous reports
(Jensen et al., 2010), we have stored samples for several
weeks with no detectable loss of cell integrity or immunos-
taining efficiency (results not shown). To assess the effects
of the fixation process on RNA quality, comparisons be-
tween fresh and fixed tissues, and fixed/sorted cells were
performed.
Cell population analysis by FCM
Fixed samples were washed 3X in ice-cold PBS and perme-
abilized on ice for 20 min in 1X PBS + 0.2% saponin + 0.1%
(w/v) BSA. All staining occurred on ice in the permeabiliza-
tion buffer, protected from light. Cells were stained with
anti-NeuN-Alexa 488 (1:200), anti-CD11b-PE-Cy7 or PE (R-
phycoerythrin) (1:200) and anti-GFAP-Alexa 647 (1:50) or
anti-EAAT2 (GLT-1)-Alexa 647 (1:100) antibodies for 45 min
on ice. Prior to staining, the EAAT2 (GLT-1) antibody was
custom conjugated to Alexa 647 utilizing the Lightning-Link
antibody conjugation kit, according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Samples were washed and resuspended for sort-
ing in permeabilization buffer containing DAPI (1 g/ml)
to identify cells with intact nuclei. FCM analysis and cell
sorting was performed using a FACSAria II equipped with
350-, 405-, 433-, 532- and 633-nm lasers, a standard filter
set, and FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). All appropriate
compensation and FMO controls were performed and uti-
lized in the analysis. Intact cells were identified using FSC
(forward-scatter) and SSC (side-scatter) parameters, singlet
gates, and DAPI staining to identify cells in cell cycle at the
time of fixation. Samples were first gated to exclude dou-
blets and any events off scale with the following singlet
gates: FSC-Width/SSC-Area, SSC-Width/FSC-Area. We then
used a cell cycle gate to identify cells with intact nuclei
based on DAPI-Width/DAPI-Area plotted on a linear scale.
Cell populations were identified and gated using FMO con-
trols. Cells were identified based on their fluorescence prop-
erties, and were sorted through a 120 M nozzle at 14 psi
into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes. Sorted cell populations were
defined as the following: neurons (NeuN+ /CD11b- /GFAP
or GLT-1- ), microglia (CD11b+ /NeuN- /GFAP or GLT-1- )
and astrocytes (GFAP or GLT-1+ /CD11b- /NeuN- ). Imme-
diately following the sort, the cells were pelleted and re-
suspended in Tri Reagent for RNA isolation. Following the
sort, an aliquot of the remaining, unsorted, fixed and
stained cells was taken for comparison to the unfixed and
fixed/sorted cells. Post-sort population analyses and graph-
ical representations were performed in FlowJo software
v.10. (TreeStar Inc.). Data are representative of three sep-
arate experiments with four independent samples per exper-
iment.

Cell-type identification on ImageStream
Cortical tissue was mechanically dissociated into a single-cell
suspension, fixed in mZBF, and stained with CD11b-PE, NeuN-
Alexa488, GFAP-Alexa647 and DAPI as described above. Flu-
orescent images were visualized on the Amnis ImageStream.
Cellular expression and distribution of these cell identifiers
were analyzed in 20 000 cells at 40× magnification, using
IDEAS software (Amnis).
Detection of histone-tail post-translational
modifications
To test whether the mZBF is compatible with detection
of histone-tail post-translational modifications by flow cy-
tomery, samples were prepared as described in the previous
sections, with the following modifications. Cells were stained
with anti-NeuN-Alexa 488 (1:200), anti-GFAP-Alexa 647
(1:50), anti-CD11b-PE (1:200), and rabbit-anti-H3K27me3
(1:100), rabbit-anti-H3K27me1 (1:100), or rabbit-anti-H3
(1:100) antibodies for 45 min on ice. Samples were washed,
and stained on ice for 30 min with an anti-rabbit-PE-Cy7
(1:750) secondary antibody. Following incubation with the
secondary antibody, the cells were washed and resuspended
in permeabilization buffer containing DAPI (1 g/ml). The
cells were analyzed on a BD LSR II equipped with 350, 405,
433, 561 and 642 nm lasers, a standard filter set, and FACS-
Diva software (BD Biosciences). All single stain compensations
and FMO controls were performed and utilized in the anal-
ysis. In single stains and FMO control samples, we included
rabbit IgG isotype control (1:100) for the histone antibod-
ies plus secondary antibodies when appropriate, to control
for non-specific antibody binding. A total of 250 000 events
were collected for each sample. Populations were identified
and defined as previously described, and the median fluo-
rescent intensity for H3, H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 were
calculated for each cell population. All data analyses were
performed using FlowJo software v. 10 (TreeStar Inc.). Data
are representative of four independent rat brain samples.
DNA, mRNA and miRNA extraction/reverse
transcription
Total RNA was extracted from fresh, fixed and fixed/sorted
cells according to the Tri Reagent protocol, with the addi-
tion of Glycoblue during the isopropanol incubation for RNA
isolation. cDNA was synthesized from 0.25 g of total RNA
using the NCodeTM VILOTM miRNA cDNA Synthesis kit accord-
ing to the manufacturer's protocol. This enables amplification
of both mRNA and miRNAs by qPCR.
Custom Jumonji histone demethylase arrays
A custom Jumonji qRT-PCR array was performed in duplicate
on pooled samples (n = 4/pool) for the initial broad screen.
mRNA expression levels of 26 characterized Jumonji genes
were present on the array and results were normalized to the
average CT
of the control genes 18s and -tubulin, using
the delta CT
method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001). The ex-
pression of a given gene was averaged across all cell types,
and the expression within a given cell type was normalized to
this average. The normalized values were subjected to a Log2
transformation and were graphically displayed as a heat map
created with TreeView software (Saldanha, 2004). All genes
whose expression differed among cell types by greater than
3-fold were independently confirmed by gene-specific qRT-
PCR in each of four independent sorted samples, derived from
four different animals.
qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR)
qRT-PCR was performed on cDNA using Power SYBR Green
and quantified using an ABI 7500 Fast system. Primers were
designed using Primer 3 software and specificity of target
gene amplification was confirmed by NCBI BLAST searches
and verification that the dissociation curves had a single peak
with a Tm
consistent with the expected amplicon. Primer ef-
ficiency was tested through the use of serial dilutions. Genes
were considered non-detectible if the CT
value fell outside of
the linear range of the given primer set serial dilution curve.
Values from duplicate qPCR measurements were averaged,
normalized to the average of two control genes (18s and -
tubulin, for mRNA analyses; and snoRNA135 and snoRNA234,
for miRNA analyses), and relative expression was determined
using the delta CT
method. Primer sequences are provided in
Table 1.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed on delta CT
values us-
ing Sigma Plot 11.0 software. A one-way ANOVA followed
by the Tukey's post hoc test was utilized when comparing
multiple groups. The Student's t test was utilized when com-
paring two groups. Statistical significance was set at the
95% confidence limit (P < 0.05). A single symbol above a bar
represents P < 0.05; two symbols P < 0.01; and three sym-
bols P < 0.001. Quantitative data are expressed as the mean

from debris based on DAPI staining and FSC­SSC properties

representing a visible division between cells and debris. These
results are consistent with a report performed on zinc-fixed
epithelial cells, showing that ZBF preserves FSC­SSC proper-
ties (Jensen et al., 2010). We used DAPI to distinguish between
debris and cells with intact nuclei/cells in the cell cycle at the
time of fixation (Figure 1B). DAPI fluorescence was plotted
as DAPI-Area/DAPI-Width to both identify the DAPI+ cells

Figure 1 FSC/SSC and DAPI staining identifies intact CNS cells
Rat brain tissue was mechanically dissociated into a single-cell suspension, fixed in mZBF, and processed for FCM, as described in the
Methods section. Doublets and off scale events were gated out based on FSC-Area/SSC-Width and SSC-Area/FSC-Width. All plots started
with the same singlet gate. (A) Typical FSC/SSC plot for rat brain cells. (B) To remove dead cells and debris from the analysis, we used
DAPI staining to gate on cells that were in the cell cycle at time of fixation. (C) Backgating on DAPI+ cells identified where debris and

while also serving as an additional singlet gate. The DAPI+
cell population accounts for 49.2 +
- 3.1% (n = 4) of the total
number of events. The DAPI stain is essential, as it acts as an
additional means to identify intact cells and to exclude de-
bris from the sample (Figure 1C). This reduces background
autofluoresence and signal from non-specifically bound
antibody.
Microglia, astrocytes and neurons can be
simultaneously identified in the non-transgenic,
adult CNS
Dissociated and fixed samples were stained with antibod-
ies to identify microglia (cell surface, anti-CD11b), astro-
cytes (intracellular, anti-GFAP or cell surface, anti-GLT-1)
and neurons (intracellular, anti-NeuN). Distinct populations
of DAPI+ microglia (Figure 2A), neurons (Figures 2A and 2C)
and astrocytes (Figures 2B and 2C) were identified based on
their immunofluorescent properties. There was clear sepa-
ration between CD11b versus NeuN (Figure 2A) and CD11b
versus GFAP (Figure 2B) immunostained cells. To determine
if there was overlap between the NeuN and GFAP staining,
we plotted NeuN versus GFAP in the CD11b- cell popula-
tion (Figure 2C). There were separate populations of cells
that were single positive for NeuN (42.6% +
- 2.29), GFAP
(3.78% +
- 0.28) and CD11b (11.3% +
- 1.85) (n = 4). However,
there was also an unexpected population of cells that were
double positive for NeuN and GFAP (0.94% +
- 0.21, n = 4).
In addition, there was a population of DAPI+ cells that were
triple negative for CD11b, NeuN and GFAP (39.0 +
- 1.3%,
n = 4). All CNS cells are not recognized by immunostaining
with these three markers. On a per 100 mg of tissue basis,
Table 2 summarizes the cell population frequencies, as well
as the average number of cells of each type obtained in three
separate and independent sample sorts. A wide FSC/SSC gate
is necessary to encompass all neurons and astrocytes, and in-
dicates that each cell type exhibits different but overlapping
scatter properties (Figure 2D). Single positive CD11b-, GFAP-
and NeuN-stained cells were visualized with an ImageStream
analysis system where distribution and localization of im-
munostaining was evaluated in single cells (Figure 2E). Data
shown in Figures 2(A)­2(D) are from a single-sample repre-
sentative of four independent samples, analyzed on the same
day.
mZBF permits retrieval of intact ribosomal-,
messenger- and miRNAs from sorted CNS cells
We next sought to determine if we could isolate RNA from
the mZBF-fixed and sorted cells. Table 2 indicates the av-
erage RNA concentrations obtained from 50 000 cells, and
the purity of RNA obtained from each cell population based
on the 260/280 ratios. To assess whether RNAs isolated from
mZBF-fixed and sorted CNS cells was of suitable quality for
downstream analyses, we utilized qRT-PCR to compare the
levels of two commonly used `control genes', the ribosomal
RNA18s, and the messenger RNA, -tubulin (n = 8). We ex-
amined this in live cells (unfixed), and cells that were either
fixed and unsorted, or fixed and sorted, to test the influ-
ence of both the fixation and sort processes. We found that
the CT
values for both 18s and -tubulin with zinc fixation
were higher when compared to CT
values in live, unfixed cells
(Figure 3A), indicating that RNA quality is somewhat reduced
by the fixation process, or that there are factor(s) acting as
PCR inhibitors. Interestingly, 18s RNA appears to be more
negatively affected by the fixation process than -tubulin,
suggesting a potential RNA size effect. When compared to
live cells, the CT
values for 18s were increased by 3 cy-
cles in both the fixed/unsorted (P < 0.001) and fixed/sorted
(P < 0.001) samples, whereas -tubulin was increased by 1
cycle in the fixed/unsorted samples (P = 0.260) and by 2 cy-
cles in the fixed/sorted samples (P = 0.024). This suggests
that larger RNAs may be more susceptible to degradation
and/or that they are more difficult to isolate than smaller

Single-cell mZBF-fixed suspensions were processed for FCM. Singlet cells were gated as described above, and then gated on DAPI as in
Figure 1(B). DAPI+ neurons, microglia and astrocytes were identified using antibodies against the cell-specific markers NeuN (neurons;
A,C), CD11b (microglia; A,B), and GFAP (astrocytes; B,C). (C) CD11b- cells were plotted against GFAP and NeuN, revealing single positive
GFAP and NeuN populations as well as a small GFAP and NeuN double positive population. (D) An overlay of the single positive CD11b,
NeuN and GFAP populations reveals that they have overlapping and variable FSC/SSC properties indicating that these parameters alone
are not useful on their own for cell-type identification in the CNS. The data shown are from a single sample that is representative of
four independent experiments. (E) Representative images of DAPI+ cells staining single positive for CD11b, GFAP or NeuN from a single

RNAs. Although there is indication that the fixation pro-
cess causes some RNA degradation/PCR inhibition, mRNA
levels are readily detectable, and the sorting process does
not appear to further compromise downstream analyses. We
next compared the levels of 18s and -tubulin among mi-
croglia, astrocytes and neurons (Figure 3B). We found that 18s
levels were significantly lower in astrocytes (GFAP+ ) com-
pared to levels in microglia (CD11b+ ; P < 0.002) and neurons
(NeuN+ ; P = 0.001). In addition, the expression of -tubulin
was significantly higher in neurons compared to microglia
(P < 0.001) and astrocytes (P = 0.001).
Since we were effective in retrieving both rRNA and mRNA
from fixed/sorted cells, we next evaluated the compatibility
of zinc fixation with the recovery of small RNAs in four

Table 2 Expected cell numbers and cell-specific RNA quantification and purity from mZBF-fixed and sorted rat brain cells
Half of a rat brain was weighed (650 mg), mechanically dissociated, and processed for flow cytometry as described in the Methods.
Doublets and off scale events were gated out based on FSC-Area/SSC-Width and SSC-Area/FSC-Width, and intact cells were gated based
on DAPI positivity (Figure 1B). Single positive CD11b, NeuN and GFAP cells were sorted from the entire tissue sample. The total number of
neurons (NeuN+ ), microglia (CD11b+ ) and astrocytes (GFAP+ ) obtained from the sort were normalized to tissue weight, and the total RNA
isolated from the sorted cells was normalized to the number of cells sorted. The percent of DAPI+ cells, the number of cells obtained per
100 mg of tissue, the total RNA per 50 000 cells and the average RNA 260/280 ratios are presented in the table for each of the three-cell

RNA was harvested and qRT-PCR was used to analyze the levels of two commonly used housekeeping genes: 18s rRNA and -tubulin
mRNA. Comparisons were made between (A) fresh tissue, fixed/unsorted cells, and fixed/sorted cells (n = 4­8) or (B) sorted neurons
(NeuN+ ), microglia (CD11b+ ) and astrocytes (GFAP+ ) (n = 8). (C) The expression of two commonly used housekeeping small non-coding

independent samples derived from four separate animals.
We screened two small non-coding nuclear RNAs that are
often used as loading controls for miRNA qRT-PCR stud-
ies, snoRNA135 and snoRNA234. We successfully detected
both snoRNAs (Figure 3C), and found no cell-type-specific
differences in the levels of either (P = 0.278 and 0.463, re-
spectively). Finally, we screened two miRNAs: miR-26 highly
expressed in the CNS (Smirnova et al., 2005), and miR-146a,
an important regulator of innate immune responses in mi-
croglia (Rom et al., 2010; Saba et al., 2012; Ponomarev
et al., 2013). Although they did not reach statistical signif-
icance, we found that compared to expression levels in mi-
croglia, miR-26 tended to be 2­3-fold more highly expressed
in neurons (P = 0.051) and astrocytes (P = 0.080). miR-26

expression levels were comparable in astrocytes and neurons
(P = 0.696). miR-146a was highly expressed in microglia, but
as expected, it was nearly undetectable in both astrocytes
(P = 0.006) and neurons (P = 0.001).
It is unclear at this time if the differences in CT
values
among cell types for 18s and -tubulin are the result of cell-
type-specific differences in expression of these RNAs, or if
there are inherent differences in the quality of RNA harvested
from different cell populations. We suspect the latter because
similar differences in expression patterns were observed with
two other housekeeping RNAs (snoRNA135 and snoRNA234),
although they were not statistically significant. snoRNA135
was similar in pattern to 18s, whereas snoRNA234 was similar
to -tubulin. In addition, the quantity of RNA obtained from
the same number of cells based on absorbance at 260 nm
appeared to be 3­4 times higher for astrocytes compared to
neurons and microglia (Table 2). To account for these differ-
ences in subsequent gene expression analyses, we averaged
the 18s and -tubulin CT
values for CT
calculations.
Cell-specific gene expression confirms purity of
fixed, stained and sorted cells
Using qRT-PCR to analyze the expression of known cell-
type-specific genes, we assessed the purity of sorted neu-
ron, microglia and astrocyte cell populations from four in-
dependent cells sorts. We found that the neuron-specific
genes NeuN, -III tubulin and neurofilament were highly ex-
pressed in NeuN+ cells, and that NeuN and -III tubulin
were lowly expressed or undetectable in microglia and astro-
cytes (Figure 4A). Surprisingly, neurofilament was somewhat
detectable in both microglia and astrocytes. The microglia-
specific genes CD11b, Iba-1 and CD68 were highly expressed
in microglial (CD11b+ ) cells, and lowly expressed or unde-
tectable in astrocyte (GFAP+ ) and neuron (NeuN+ ) popula-
tions (Figure 4B). Likewise, the astrocyte-specific genes GFAP,
GLT-1 and ALDH1L1 were highly expressed in GFAP+ cells
(Figure 4C) and lowly expressed in microglia and neurons.
Cell-type specific expression of Jumonji histone
demethylases
We used a custom qPCR array to analyze the expression of
26 JmjC-domain containing histone demethylases (Jumonji
demethylases) in sorted microglia, neurons and astrocytes.
For initial screening purposes, we pooled equal amounts of
cDNA from four independent animal samples into a single
sample (run in duplicate) to obtain the average expression
of each Jumonji gene in all cell types. We found that 12 of
the 26 Jumonji mRNAs were differentially expressed among
cell types by at least 2­3-fold, and seven had greater than a
3-fold change relative to the other cell types (Figure 5A). We
confirmed these results in samples from four independent
cell sorts, obtained from four different animals, using qRT-
PCR to profile the Jumonji mRNAs identified by the array as

relative to that in NeuN+ cells, respectively).
Identification of histone-tail post-translational
modifications by FCM
To determine if investigations of the functional role of Ju-
monji histone demethylases in sorted CNS cells could be
performed using this method, we next assessed whether
histone-tail post-translational modifications could be visu-
alized by FCM in mZBF-fixed microglia, neurons and astro-
cytes. We co-stained cells with antibodies against H3K27me1
(Figures 6A and 6B) and H3K27me3 (Figures 6C and 6D), to-
gether with cell-specific markers. As expected, we detected
both H3K27me3 and H3K27me1 in all cell types. However,
neurons and astrocytes appeared to have increased and more
heterogeneous expression of H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 than
microglia as evidenced by broader peaks on the histogram.
We also used an antibody against the H3 histone protein
that recognizes an epitope on the C-terminus of the core hi-
stone not readily accessible in its native conformation. With
this antibody, we observed only a slight shift in the mean
fluorescent intensity (Figures 6E and 6F) although pan H3
immunostaining in microglia, in contrast to the methylated
immunostaining at H3K27, appeared to be greater than in
neurons and astrocytes. These results indicate that native hi-
stone structure is maintained in the mZBF-fixed cells, that
histone tail post-translational modifications can be visual-
ized by FCM in this fixative, and that levels of methylated
histones differ among CNS cell types.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to successfully iden-
tify and isolate distinct CNS neuron and glial cell populations
simultaneously from the adult, non-transgenic, rodent brain
based on a combination of intra- and extra-cellular markers
by FCM. The mZBF used here preserves cell surface, intra-
cellular, and nuclear protein structure, and we have used it
to perform analyses of cell cycle, histone tail modifications,
and other proteins prior to cell sorting, maximizing the in-
formation obtainable from a single CNS tissue sample. We
show that the quality of ribosomal, messenger and miRNAs
retrieved from the sorted cells is adequate for subsequent
downstream qRT-PCR analyses, providing a means to study
epigenetic regulation of gene expression in the specific CNS
populations from the same sample. This important technical
advance represents a particularly significant step forward for
gene expression studies in non-neuronal cell types for which
intracellular epitopes are the best characterized, and/or for
which antibodies against extracellular epitopes of cell-type-
specific surface markers are not widely available. An addi-
tional benefit of this method is the ability to store samples
for many weeks for later analyses.

Cell-type-specific CNS Jumonji expression
Figure 6 Post-translational histone modifications can be analyzed by FCM in zinc-fixed cells
mZBF-fixed cell suspensions were stained with antibodies against NeuN, CD11b, and GFAP to identify neurons, microglia and astrocytes
respectively, in the presence of antibodies against the histone mark (A,B) H3K27me1, (C,D) H3K27me3, or (E,F) pan-H3. Singlet and
DAPI+ gated populations were subsequently gated by cell-type, and changes in the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) of the respective
histone marks were assessed. Shifts in the MFI with primary antibody relative to signal with IgG isotype control antibody are shown in
the histograms, and averaged data (n = 4 independent samples) are shown in the bar graphs.
Cellular fixation and permeabilization are necessary for
antibody-mediated detection of intracellular antigens by
FCM. Recovery of RNAs from standard formaldehyde- or
paraformaldehyde-fixed cells is poor (Esser et al., 1995; Diez
et al., 1999) especially when cell numbers are limiting, and al-
cohol fixation is not ideal for extracellular marker-based cell
identification [results not shown and (Shapiro, 1988; Perez
et al., 2001)]. Several recent studies have successfully used
an alcohol-based fixation method for recovery of RNA from
intracellularly identified neuron populations (Guez-Barber
et al., 2011b; Fanous et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014). However,
because we wished to use a combination of intracellular and
cell surface markers for cell identification, we applied the
modified zinc-based fixation method to isolate RNAs from
fixed and sorted neurons and glia. Consistent with previous
reports (Wester et al., 2003; Lykidis et al., 2007; Jensen et al.,
2010), DNA could also be successfully isolated from zinc-fixed
cells (results not shown), increasing the utility of this tech-
nique for the study of epigenetic DNA modifications. Many
fields are plagued by the need/desire to fix samples prior to
flow cytometric analysis and/or cell sorting, and more infor-
mation can be obtained from fixed cells (because intracel-
lular proteins can be quantified). Fixation often adds a level
of safety for more biohazardous samples since significant
biosafety concerns are present when working with human,
pathogen-infected or virally transduced cells, particularly in
FCM facilities where the potential for aerosolization is high
(Schmid et al., 2003). Although not tested here, this fixation

method may also be a useful alternative to live sorting when
nucleic acid recovery is desired from biohazardous samples.
We undertook the present study to begin to investigate
the epigenetic control of gene expression in microglia and
neurons as it relates to cell­cell communication in pathol-
ogy. Although live microglia can easily be identified and
sorted based on cell surface marker identification (e.g. CD11b)
(Nikodemova and Watters, 2012), the same cannot be done
with live neurons, as the best-characterized markers are in-
tracellular. Adult astrocyte identification also suffers from
the same issues as neurons with regard to intracellular mark-
ers and/or antibodies only being available toward intracel-
lular epitopes of cell surface markers (e.g. GLT-1). Indeed,
the dissociation procedure reported here is not optimized
for astrocytes as the mechanical disruption decreases as-
trocyte viability, reducing their recovery. However, the me-
chanical method was optimal for the retrieval of neurons
and microglia, which are the major cell types of interest
to us. In the course of optimizing this technique for our
purposes, we found that enzymatic dissociation with papain
(Nikodemova and Watters, 2012) permitted much better as-
trocyte recovery, although it greatly decreased neuron re-
trieval (results not shown). Efficiency of microglial recovery
with both methods was not different. The overlap observed
between the GFAP+ and NeuN+ cells (<1%; Figure 2C) is
probably a product of the mechanical dissociation process.
For example, incomplete dissociation may result in astrocyte
debris sticking to neuronal cells. Alternatively, GFAP/NeuN
double positive cells could represent a population of neu-
ral progenitor cells expressing both NeuN and GFAP markers
(Sanchez-Ramos et al., 2000). Results from the ImageStream
analyses supported both notions: whereas there were true
NeuN+ /GFAP+ double positive cells (likely precursor cells),
the most were double positive because of cell debris stuck
to an intact cell (results not shown). In addition, there was
a large proportion of cells (39%) that were triple nega-
tive for the three cell identification markers used here. Al-
though additional studies are needed to specifically identify
the members of this cell population, we speculate that these
are likely to be astrocyte/glial cells and endothelial cells that
were not identified by the primary markers used here. For
example, whereas GFAP is the most commonly used marker
for astrocytes, it is only expressed by a fraction of astrocytes,
the intensity and percentage of which varies throughout the
brain (Kimelberg, 2004). Thus, while the present dissocia-
tion method is not ideal for GFAP+ astrocyte recovery, more
efficient and universal astrocyte identification may require
simultaneous staining with multiple astrocyte markers (e.g.
GFAP, GLT-1, ALDH1L1), regardless of dissociation method.
Because histone demethylation is commonly associ-
ated with the activation/repression of gene transcription
(Takeuchi et al., 2006; Kooistra and Helin, 2012), and many
microglial inflammatory activities require new gene tran-
scription of cytokines and other mediators of inflammation
(Blackwell and Christman, 1997; Doyle and O'Neill, 2006),
we were particularly interested in which histone demethy-
lase enzymes were expressed in microglia and neurons. In
this study, we focused on the Jumonji histone demethylase
gene family that contains 30 members based on sequence
homology (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). The Jumonji demethy-
lases catalyze a dioxygenase reaction to remove mono-, di-
and tri-methyl groups from lysine and arginine residues, pri-
marily on histone H3, H4 and H1 substrates. This reaction is
dependent on Fe (II) and -ketoglutarate (Kooistra and Helin,
2012). There is very little known about the role of Jumonji
histone demethylases in the regulation of CNS function in
general, and nothing is known about their cell-specific ex-
pression in the adult CNS. Given the significant differences in
gene expression profiles in microglia, neurons and astrocytes,
we hypothesized that there would be cell-type-specific dif-
ferences in the basal expression of the Jumonji demethylase
genes.
We found that seven Jumonji family genes were most
differentially expressed between neurons, microglia and as-
trocytes. PHF8, JMJD1C and JMJD2D were highly neuron-
specific as they were undetectable or very lowly expressed in
microglia and astrocytes. Neuronal expression of PHF8 and
JMJD1C is consistent with previous reports (Wolf et al., 2007;
Qiu et al., 2010). PHF8 is important for proper neural de-
velopment (Qiu et al., 2010), and its mutation is associated
with Fragile X syndrome, believed in part to be responsible
for the associated cognitive deficits (Laumonnier et al., 2005;
Kleine-Kohlbrecher et al., 2010). JMJD1C protein levels are
high in androgen-responsive neurons where it is proposed to
be involved in the co-activation of the androgen receptor
(Wolf et al., 2007). Although mutations in the JMJD1C gene
are linked to the development of autism (Castermans et al.,
2007; Shulha et al., 2012), this relationship is not fully un-
derstood as the histone substrate for this enzyme has not yet
been identified (Kooistra and Helin, 2012). Very little is known
about the role of JMJD2D in the CNS. However, similar to
JMJD1C, JMJD2D acts as an androgen receptor co-activator
in the prostate (Shin and Janknecht, 2007). Perhaps in the
CNS, JMJD2D plays a similar role to JMJD1C. We found that
JMJD3 and JMJD5 were more highly expressed in microglia
than in astrocytes or neurons. JMJD3 is an important regu-
lator of both inflammatory (De Santa et al., 2009; Das et al.,
2010; Luo et al., 2011) and anti-inflammatory activities in
macrophages (Satoh et al., 2010), and JMJD5 expression in
osteoclasts is an important regulator of osteoclastogenesis
(Youn et al., 2012). There is now one report of a Jumonji
gene family member (JMJD3) in microglia (Tang et al., 2014).
JMJD3 was shown to be critical for switching between in-
flammatory and anti-inflammatory/reparative phenotypes in
immortalized microglia, consistent with reported effects in
macrophages. Finally, we found UTX and JHDM1D to be more
lowly expressed in astrocytes, compared to neurons and mi-
croglia. UTX is an X-chromosome-linked gene and is more
highly expressed in the female brain (Xu et al., 2008), but
nothing is known about its expression in astrocytes. Only
male rats were included in our study; thus, it is possible that
UTX levels may be higher in astrocytes isolated from female

Cell-type-specific CNS Jumonji expression
rats. Interestingly, a point mutation in the UTX gene results
in Kabuki syndrome (Lederer et al., 2012; Miyake et al., 2013)
characterized by developmental delay, cognitive disabilities
and craniofacial abnormalities. Because these morbidities are
also associated with aberrant astrocyte activity (e.g. Alexan-
der disease, Fragile X disease) (Molofsky et al., 2012), impaired
or overactive UTX activity in astrocytes specifically, may play
an important physiological role in neuropsychiatric disease.
Lastly, little information is available on the role of JHDM1D
in the brain. It is known to regulate neural differentiation
(Huang et al., 2010b) and neural fate specification (Huang
et al., 2010a) during embryogenesis. We find its expression
in the adult CNS to be lowest in astrocytes and highest in
neurons, consistent with the idea that the JHDM1D gene
may be down-regulated in astrocytes after progenitors have
committed to the glial phenotype. Whether differences in
basal Jumonji demethylase gene expression contribute to
cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression in the adult
CNS is not yet known, but the present data are consistent
with this possibility.
There are apparent differences in the magnitude of
H3K27me1 and H3K27me3 among CNS cell types, with neu-
rons having the highest expression of both marks. While the
significance of this is not yet clear, differences in H3K27
methylation at the specific gene promoters may contribute
to fundamental, cell-specific differences in gene expression
profiles among these cell types. Additional studies involv-
ing chromatin immunoprecipitations are necessary to test
this hypothesis further. In addition to histone modifications,
miRNAs are another important aspect of epigenetic gene
regulation. In this study, we evaluated levels of miR-146a
and miR-26 in sorted microglia, astrocytes and neurons to
determine if the quality of recovered miRNAs from cells pro-
cessed in this way was adequate for subsequent investigation.
While we could easily amplify miRNAs, we found cell-type
specificity of the two miRNAs we evaluated. We found that
miR-146a was highly expressed in microglia (but was very
low in neurons and astrocytes), consistent with its expres-
sion primarily in myeloid lineage cells (O'Connell et al., 2011;
Ponomarev et al., 2013). Because miR-26 is reported to be
preferentially expressed in astrocytes (Smirnova et al., 2005),
we were surprised to find it equally detectable in astrocytes
and neurons. However, the astrocyte-specific expression of
miR-26 was determined in differentiated murine stem cells
in vitro (Smirnova et al., 2005). Our samples are rat, and
there are significant species differences in miRNAs. Alter-
natively, differences may be related to cell age. Our studies
were performed on adult cells isolated from the whole brain;
stem cells differentiated in vitro may not accurately reflect
identical gene expression levels and patterns of 3-month-
old adult cells in vivo. Furthermore, gene expression in neu-
rons and astrocytes in vivo are highly influenced by the CNS
microenvironment and cannot be identically recapitulated
in vitro during stem cell differentiation. Together, these re-
sults reinforce the need to study miRNAs in specific cell types
in vivo.
In conclusion, this technique adapts known FCM and cell
fixation methods to the field of neuroscience, advancing our
ability to study epigenetics and gene regulation simultane-
ously in glia and neurons. To lay the foundation for future
studies of histone demethylation-regulated gene expression,
we utilized this procedure to investigate the profile of Ju-
monji gene family histone demethylase expression in neu-
rons, microglia and astrocytes from the healthy CNS. Our
findings are consistent with the limited available literature.
More importantly, the results provide new information about
cell-specific Jumonji gene expression in the adult CNS, under-
scoring the importance of understanding cell-specific regu-
lation of epigenetic modifiers in the adult, non-transgenic
brain.
