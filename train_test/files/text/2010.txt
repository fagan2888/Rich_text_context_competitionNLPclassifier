Introduction
Veterans of military service constitute a large and growing seg-
ment of the US adult population. The Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) estimated that there were 23.1 million Veterans in
the United States in 2009, of whom 5.7 million used publicly
funded VA health care at least once during the fiscal year (1).
Obesity and overweight might be expected a priori to be less
common among Veterans than among non-Veterans. New
recruits must pass medical evaluation to enter military service,
which would screen out those with serious pre-existing obesity
or obesity-related chronic conditions. Overweight and obesity
at intake into the Air Force were indeed found to be less com-
mon than among respondents of similar age and gender in a
large national survey (2). Physical fitness is mandated through-
out a military career, and some evidence suggests that higher
exercise levels are maintained after discharge from service (3).
Tobacco smoking has also been found to be more common
among Veterans than among non-Veterans (4) and might limit
weight gain. Nonetheless, results from the Centers for Disease
Control Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),
a large national telephone survey, suggested that Veterans
were significantly more likely to be classified as overweight
(BMI = 25­29.9kg/m2) but about equally likely to be classified
as obese (BMI  30kg/m2) compared to non-Veterans of simi-
lar age and gender (5,6).
A concern about the higher prevalence of overweight in
Veterans in BRFSS data is that it may be an artifact of meas-
urement error. In telephone surveys, BMI must be based on
self-reported height and weight. Validation studies have found
that survey respondents generally tend to over-report their
height and to under-report their weight (7,8). The extent to
which reporting biases may vary in relation to demographic
characteristics and Veteran status is unknown. In addition,
some authors have questioned the validity of BMI itself as an
indicator of obesity (9), especially in highly physically fit indi-
viduals, such as professional athletes (10,11). Compared with
BMI, waist circumference has been found to be more strongly
correlated with percent body fat as assessed by dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in males (12) and to be more
strongly correlated with cardiovascular risk factors (13). Other
authors have advocated use of the waist-to-height ratio as a
simple measure of excess weight (14).
The present study sought to re-examine the association
between Veteran status and overweight/obesity status, using

Veterans comprise a large and growing segment of the US population. Results from national telephone surveys
suggest higher prevalence of overweight among Veterans compared with demographically similar non-Veterans,
based on self-reported height and weight. Using 1999­2008 data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), we compared 3,768 Veterans and 21,974 non-Veterans on: (i) several measures of adiposity based
on direct anthropometry; (ii) life-course of self-reported BMI; and (iii) behaviors related to weight loss or maintenance.
Whether Veterans were more likely than demographically similar non-Veterans to be obese or overweight depended
on the adiposity measure employed. On BMI, Veterans were about equally likely to be obese (30+ kg/m2), but more
likely to be overweight (25­29.9kg/m2) by both self-report and by direct measurement (significantly so only by self-
report). On waist-stature ratio, a roughly similar pattern was observed. On waist circumference, Veterans tended to
have larger values than demographically similar non-Veterans, with more Veterans in the largest two categories. But
on dual-photon X-ray absorptiometry, Veterans were less likely to have 35+% body fat than non-Veterans of similar
age, gender, and race/ethnicity. Life-course trends in self-reported BMI suggested a possible burst of weight gain
after military discharge. These results suggest that Veterans may, on average, have less excess body fat than
non-Veterans--a pattern not revealed by standard anthropometric measures.

data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). NHANES collects data on weight, height,
and other anthropometric measures by direct examination.
In certain years, DXA-derived measures of percent body fat
were also obtained. Thus, we retested the null hypothesis of
no difference in the prevalence of obesity and overweight by
Veteran status using other and arguably better measures of adi-
posity. Interview data with NHANES participants also permit-
ted comparisons between Veterans and non-Veterans as to the
life-course trajectory of adiposity, albeit based on self-report
of weight and height at earlier ages. This information may shed
light on how any differences in adiposity by Veteran status
arise with age.
Methods and Procedures
Sample
Data from the NHANES from 1999­2008 were combined for analysis.
DetailsoftheNHANESsampledesignanddatacollectionmethodology
are available elsewhere (15). Briefly, NHANES seeks to identify a prob-
ability sample of civilian, noninstitutionalized US residents. Since 1999,
data collection has been conducted every year. A multi-stage sampling
design is used, involving stratification by geographic region, probabil-
ity samples of primary sampling units (generally counties) within each
region, census tracts within primary sampling units, dwelling units
within census tracts, and finally individual respondents within dwell-
ing units. The present analysis included 25,743 adults aged 21 years or
older with known Veteran-status information.
Data
NHANES collected data both by direct in-person examination and by
interviews with examinees. Height, weight, and waist circumference
were assessed by direct measurement in all years, and self-reported
height and weight were also obtained in all years. Those values were
used to obtain several measures of adiposity: (i) BMI calculated as
(weight in kilograms)/(height in meters)2 using interview data; (ii) BMI
calculated similarly by direct measurement; (iii) waist circumference
by direct measurement, in centimeters; and (iv) waist-stature ratio by
direct measurement, as (waist circumference in centimeters)/(height in
meters). In addition, in 1999­2004, NHANES examinations included
DXA, which yielded estimates of percent body fat for 13,182 examinees
in those years. All of these measures have been used in epidemiologic
studies to quantify the population frequency of excess body weight
(12). Strictly speaking, only DXA provides a direct measure of body fat-
ness or adiposity. The remaining measures are best regarded as yielding
proxy indicators of adiposity, based on simpler and less costly anthro-
pometric measurements. Data on key covariates including age, gender,
race, and education, were obtained from interviews.
Analysis
Values for each measure were grouped into categories as shown in
Table 3. For BMI, standard cutpoints appearing in the literature (e.g.,
(5,6,16)) were used. For waist circumference and waist-stature ratio,
we chose gender-specific cutpoints based on work by Flegal et al. (12),
using values that corresponded approximately to percent body fat of
25%, 30%, and 35%, respectively, for persons aged 20­39 years.
Because the distribution of sociodemographic factors proved to be
quite different between Veterans and non-Veterans, we used model-based
direct adjustment to control for potentially confounding factors (17).
This method applies a regression-based weighting factor to the original
NHANES sampling weight for each observation, based on its combina-
tion of covariate values. Summary statistics based on these augmented
weights can be interpreted as estimates of the value expected in the group
of interest if it had the same distribution of covariates as found in a refer-
ence population (here, all sampled Veterans).
To account for stratification and multi-stage sampling in NHANES,
the svy survey data commands in Stata 11.0 were used for all analyses
(Stata, College Station, TX). P values were based on Pearson's 2 statis-
tic, corrected for the survey design and converted to an F-statistic (18).
P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 compares the distribution of several sociodemo-
graphic characteristics between non-Veterans and Veterans
in the study sample. Compared with non-Veterans, Veterans
were generally older, were much more likely to be males, were
predominantly non-Hispanic whites, and had generally higher
educational attainment. A much larger percentage of Veterans
were former smokers, but the prevalence of current smoking
was similar.
Overall, about one-third of both Veterans and non-
Veterans
were classified as obese on the basis of having a directly meas-
ured BMI  30kg/m2 (Table 2). Fewer than 2% of either group
were underweight (BMI < 18.5kg/m2). A larger proportion
of Veterans were overweight, with a BMI from 25­29.9kg/m2
(42.6% vs. 33.1%). However, once BMI in non-Veterans was
adjusted to the age, gender, and race/ethnicity distribution of
Veterans, the two groups were similarly distributed among the
BMI categories. Further adjustment for education (as catego-
rized in Table 1) yielded only slight incremental differences.
Pastpublishedcomparisonsofexcessweightbetweennational
samples of Veterans vs. demographically similar non-Veterans
used BRFSS data (5,6) and were thus based on height and weight
as self-reported in a telephone survey. To help isolate the influ-
ence of method of BMI measurement (based on self-reported
vs. directly measured height and weight), Table 3 compares
BMI by both methods on NHANES participants. The distribu-
tion among obesity/overweight categories by directly measured
BMI was shifted upward in relation to the BMI distribution by
self-report in both Veterans and non-Veterans. By self-report,
about 28­29% of both groups were classified as obese, while by
direct measurement, about 32­33% of both groups were obese.
Nonetheless, the prevalence of obesity was nearly equal between
Veterans and non-Veterans classified by the same method. By
either method, differences between Veterans and non-Veterans
were largely confined to the normal and overweight categories:
overweight was more common, and normal weight less com-
mon, in Veterans than in non-Veterans. This difference was sta-
tistically significant in the self-reported comparison, but not in
the directly measured comparison.
Table 3 also compares Veterans and non-Veterans of similar
age, gender, and race/ethnicity on other measures of adiposity.
On waist circumference, the distribution in Veterans tended
to be shifted toward larger values than in non-Veterans, with
the largest excess prevalence in the next-to-highest category.
On waist-stature ratio, which aims to correct waist circumfer-
ence for height differences, the distribution among Veterans
was more concentrated in the two middle categories, with
proportionally fewer Veterans in the lowest and highest cat-
egories. On percent body fat as measured by DXA, the distri-
bution among Veterans was even more concentrated in the two
middle categories (25­34.9% body fat), with a notably smaller

epidemiology
proportion of Veterans (20.6%) than non-Veterans (23.9%) in
the most obese category (35+% body fat).
Table 4 shows results concerning possible differences in
the trajectory of weight gain over the life course between
Veterans and non-Veterans. Respondents in the interview
part of NHANES were asked to recall their height and weight
at age 25 years, which was then used to estimate BMI retro-
spectively at that age. The age-25 BMI for each participant was
then compared to his/her BMI (from self-reported height and
weight) at the time of the examination. Because the amount
of time between age 25 and age at examination varied among
the age strata, mean annual change in BMI was calculated to
facilitate comparisons. For this analysis, only subjects aged
30 years or older at examination time were included, so that
sufficient time had passed between age 25 and their current
age. Three 15-year age groups were used to achieve a relatively
even distribution of subjects among the groups. The mean rate
of change in BMI was nearly identical between Veterans and
non-Veterans among examinees aged 45­59 or 60­74 years at

examination. However, in the youngest age group, the rate of
increase in BMI was significantly greater among Veterans than
among non-Veterans.
Lastly, Table 5 addresses the frequency of self-reported
weight-control behaviors among NHANES participants by
BMI category, comparing Veterans and demographically simi-
lar non-Veterans. Overweight Veterans were 3­4 percentage
points more likely to report trying to lose weight or maintain
their weight, compared to overweight non-Veterans, although
these differences were of only borderline statistical signifi-
cance. Otherwise, the groups were similar.
Discussion
To what extent are obesity and overweight more prevalent in
US Veterans than in demographically similar non-Veterans?
The answer to this question can help quantify the burden of
obesity and obesity-related diseases on Veterans and on the
publicly funded health care resources that they use. It may
also contribute to judging the long-term impacts of health
habits influenced by military service, including diet, exercise,
and smoking. Because both body weight and percent body fat
tend to be greater in older age groups in large national surveys
(12,16) (particularly after accounting for birth-cohort effects),
it was important to adjust for age differences between Veterans
and non-Veterans.
We found that whether Veteran status is a risk factor for
excess body weight depends to a large extent on how adiposity
is measured and how "excess body weight" is defined. When
assessed with BMI using directly measured height and weight,
obesity defined as BMI  30kg/m2 was about equally prevalent
in Veterans and non-Veterans after adjusting for differences in
age, gender, and race/ethnicity. The prevalence of overweight
defined as BMI 25­29.9kg/m2 was about two percentage points
more common in Veterans than in demographically similar
non-Veterans when based on directly measured height and
weight, or about three percentage points more prevalent when
based on self-reported height and weight. (Only by self-report
was the difference statistically significant.) A roughly similar
pattern was observed for waist-stature ratio which, like BMI,
involves a simple correction for height. For waist circumfer-
ence, the distribution among Veterans appeared to be shifted
upward rather than being more concentrated in the middle of
the distribution. Yet another answer was provided by percent
body fat as assessed by DXA: Veterans were less likely to fall
into the high-body-fat (35+%) or low-body-fat (<25%) catego-
ries and more likely to have 25­35% body fat by DXA, toward
the middle of the population distribution.
The study also provided further evidence about bias in
BMI when based on self-reported height and weight. In both
Veterans and non-Veterans, BMI calculated from self-reported
height and weight tended to be lower than BMI calculated
from direct measurements. The prevalence of BMI-defined
obesity (30kg/m2) was about four percentage points greater
when based on directly measured height and weight than
when based on self-reported height and weight in both groups.
Smaller discrepancies in the prevalence of BMI-defined over-
weight (BMI 25­29.9kg/m2) were seen in both groups. Still,

there was little evidence of any differential bias between
Veterans and non-Veterans. This conclusion would lend sup-
port to previous comparative studies based on self-reported
BMI (e.g., (4­6,19)) using much larger sample sizes.
However, the DXA comparisons in this study raise questions
about the validity of BMI itself as an indicator of adiposity in
Veterans. Judging by BMI, Veterans were equally likely to be
obese and somewhat more likely to be overweight than demo-
graphically similar non-Veterans, whereas Veterans were found
to be less likely to have high (35+%) body fat content on DXA
scanning than demographically similar non-Veterans. These
apparent discrepancies suggest that concerns expressed about
the validity of BMI as an adiposity measure in physically fit
individuals (10,11) may apply beyond just professional athletes
and active-duty military personnel. Other authors (20) have
questioned whether BMI controls adequately for stature--
a relevant concern inasmuch as Veterans tended to be taller
than non-Veterans of similar age, gender, and race/ethnicity
in the NHANES sample (data not shown). Another possibility
is that even though average percent body fat may be lower in
Veterans, its anatomical distribution may differ, with more fat
concentrated in the abdomen among Veterans.
Based on these findings, clinicians providing care to Veterans
may want to use extra caution when interpreting BMI as an
indicator of adiposity. BMI values just above 25kg/m2 in a
physically fit Veteran may classify the individual as overweight,
even though DXA would not reveal excess body fat.
In light of our results, descriptions of changes in adiposity
over the life course would ideally be assessed by serial DXA
scans for body-fat measurement on a panel of individuals as
they aged. In the absence of such evidence, NHANES data do
permit retrospective description of trends in adiposity over the
life course based on self-reported BMI. We found that the rate
of increase in BMI since age 25 years was significantly greater
for Veterans aged 30­44 years at the time of NHANES partici-
pation than among comparably aged non-Veterans. With later
age at examination, the Veteran/non-Veteran differences in rate
of change of BMI disappeared. Although no information was
available about the age at which each Veteran separated from
military service, a typical pattern would involve a few years of
active duty as a young adult, followed by a transition to Veteran
status. Thus, a possible interpretation of these findings is that
a "burst" of weight gain may occur in the first few years after
separating from the military, followed by gradual convergence
to the same pattern of weight gain with age seen in non-Veter-
ans. This interpretation is consistent with recent findings from
the Millennium Cohort Study, involving periodic surveys of a
cohort of military personnel during and after active duty (21).
Although NHANES data have many strengths, several limi-
tations of this study should be kept in mind. Although we
combined data over a 10-year period, sample sizes remained
modest in comparison to the much larger national telephone
survey samples that have been used to compare Veterans and
non-Veterans. Arguably the most accurate measure of adipos-
ity, percent body fat based on DXA scanning, was part of the
NHANES examination protocol only in certain survey years,
resulting in further diminution of sample size. No details were
available about the duration of active duty or timing of separa-
tion from military service. Previous studies based on BRFSS
data have suggested important differences within Veterans
according to whether they did or did not receive health care
through the VA, which bears on the degree to which obesity
poses a special burden to publicly financed care for Veterans.
No data on VA health care use were available in NHANES.
Finally, we found a glimmer of hope in the comparison
of self-reported weight-control behaviors among NHANES
respondents. In comparison with non-Veterans in the same
BMI category, overweight Veterans were somewhat more likely
to report that they were trying to lose or maintain weight.
Conceivably, military service may inculcate a leaner, fitter
desirable body image that may persist into later life. If so, per-
haps weight-control programs in Veterans may be able to capi-
talize on that difference in readiness to change when seeking to
motivate healthy dietary and exercise behaviors.
