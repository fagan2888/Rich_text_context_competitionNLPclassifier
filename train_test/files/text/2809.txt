Background. Habitual gait speed (HGS) and the figure-of-8 walking test (F8WT) are measures of walking ability
that have been associated with mobility outcomes and disability among older adults. Our objective was to contrast the
physiologic, health, and behavioral attributes underlying performance of these two walking tests among older adults with
mobility limitations.
Methods. HGS and F8WT were the primary outcomes. HGS was measured as time needed to walk a 4-m straight
course at usual pace from standstill position. F8WT was measured as time to walk in a figure-of-8 pattern at self-selected
usual pace from standstill position. Separate multivariable linear regression models were constructed that predicted walk-
ing performance. Independent variables included physiologic, cognitive­behavioral health attributes, and demographic
information.
Results.Of 430 participants, 414 completed both walking tests. Participants were 67.7% female, had a mean age
of 76.5
±
7.0 years and a mean of 4.1
±
2.0 chronic conditions. Mean HGS was 0.94
±
0.23 m/s and mean F8WT was
8.80
±
2.90 seconds. Within separate multivariable linear regression models (HGS: R2 = .46, p
model
< .001; F8WT:
R2 = .47, p
model
< .001), attributes statistically significant within both models included: trunk extension endurance, ankle
range of motion, leg press velocity at peak power, executive function, and sensory loss. Cognitive and physiologic attrib-
utes uniquely associated with F8WT were cognitive processing speed and self-efficacy, and reaction time and heel-to-
floor time. Pain and peak leg press strength were associated with only HGS.
Conclusions. Both HGS and F8WT are useful tests of walking performance. Factors uniquely associated with F8WT
suggest that it may be well suited for use among older adult patients with balance problems or at risk for falls.

Mobility limitations affect 25% of adults more than
65 years and impede walking and physical activity
in this population (1). A number of studies suggest that
limitations in mobility are of increasingly greater concern
among elderly adults because this ability remains central to
maintaining functional independence (2). Therefore, tools
that allow for early screening of those at risk for decline in
mobility and performance-based walking are indispensable
for both geriatric research and clinical care (3). Key among
these tools is habitual gait speed (HGS), a measure of
straight-path walking, and a predictor of subsequent mor-
bidity and mortality (4). Another important measure and a
recently validated test of walking skill, the figure-of-8 walk-
ingtest(F8WT),istheorizedtomoreaccuratelyassesswalk-
ing during activities that require navigating around curved
paths and avoiding obstacles (5). Some reports indicate
that F8WT and HGS performance may be linked to tests of
executive function (5). However, most of the studies evalu-
ating the attributes that underlie walking performance have
been completed among relatively small samples (N < 150
participants) and have not directly compared HGS and
the F8WT across a wide array of attributes that may influ-
ence performance (6). Consequently, it remains unclear
whether the two tests reflect different health attributes that
BOSTON RISE, THE FIGURE-OF-8 WALKING TEST 1533
underlie mobility limitations among community-dwelling
older adults. We therefore sought to compare the physi-
ologic, cognitive, and health attributes underlying perfor-
mance of HGS and F8WT to better understand how the two
tests contrast. Direct comparison of the two tests allows
us to better understand the relationships among the attrib-
utes that influence mobility performance among elderly
adults. To address this aim, we conducted an analysis of
baseline data collected as part of the Boston Rehabilitative
Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE). Boston
RISE is a prospective cohort study among 430 primary
care patients aged 65 and older, who are at risk for mobil-
ity decline and disability. Because F8WT consists of both
curvilinear and straight patterns of walking, we expected
that the Boston RISE study results would help delineate
the contexts of care in which the respective walking tests
would be most useful.
Methods
All data were collected as part of the Boston RISE
at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston,
Massachusetts. Boston RISE is a prospective cohort study
of 430 primary care patients aged 65 and older (7). Details
regarding the aims, recruitment, and methods employed
within Boston RISE have been published elsewhere and
will be briefly summarized (7). Recruitment for the study
was initiated in December 2009 and was completed in 2012.
Participants were recruited through primary care practices
based at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and
Women's Hospital, which are Partners HealthCare Medical
Centers, located in Boston, MA. Eligibility criteria included
aged 65 or older, ability to understand and communicate
in English, and presence of preclinical disability defined
as self-reported limitation or modification in the ability to
walk half mile or climb one flight of stairs (10 steps), or
limitations in performing these mobility tasks due to under-
lying health conditions (8). Exclusion criteria were the
presence of a terminal disease, an episode of major surgery
or myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, a planned
major surgery, an anticipated move from the Boston area
within 2 years, major medical problems interfering with
safe and successful testing, mini-mental status exam score
less than 18, and Short Physical Performance Battery score
less than 4 (7).
To address our aims, we performed a cross-sectional
analysis of baseline data from the Boston RISE cohort.
We included only those individuals (N = 414, 96%) who
completed both HGS and F8WT and were able to do so
without the use of a walker. These measures served as our
primary (dependent) outcome measures. Both HGS and
F8WT measures were verbally explained and demonstrated
to study participants prior to performance. Time needed
to walk a 4-m straight course at usual pace from a stand-
still position was recorded using a stopwatch (timed to 0.1
second) and was defined as the time between the first foot-
fall after the 0-m mark and the first footfall after the 4-m
mark. HGS was computed as the distance (4 m) divided by
the time to complete the walk (9). F8WT was measured as
the time to walk in a figure-of-8 pattern around two cones
placed 5 ft apart (1.525 m), at usual pace from a standstill
position (5). Participants started the walk from midway
between the cones, facing outward from the cones, and
asked to stop on return to the starting position. To avoid
influencing movement planning for the F8WT, there was
no mark to indicate the start or stop position or the specific
direction to start the walk (clockwise vs anticlockwise). We
measured time from the first step and continued till the last
step brought the participant to side-by-side stance of the
feet at the original start point between the two cones (5).
The time to complete the task was the focus of our test,
but others have measured the amplitude (number of tests
taken) and the accuracy (the tightness or wideness of the
curved path) (5). Intraclass correlation coefficient for test­
retest reliability for time to complete F8WT is .84 (95%
CI: 0.62­0.94) (5), and intraclass correlation coefficient for
HGS is .78 (95% CI: 0.63­0.92) (10,11).
Health and cognitive­behavioral attributes assessed
included pain severity via the severity subscale of the
Brief Pain Inventory (12), depression as manifested by
a score greater than or equal to 10 on the Patient Health
Questionnaire 9-item scale (13), self-efficacy via the
Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (14), and exec-
utive function and psychomotor speed via the Trails-making
test A and B. The Trails A test primarily assesses visuoper-
ceptual and psychomotor speed, whereas Trails B assesses
switching of attention, working memory, and cognitive
flexibility (all executive functions), as well as psychomotor
speed and visuoperceptual abilities. A derived trails score
(Trails B - A) was used to emphasize executive function by
diminishing the influence of psychomotor speed (15).
Physiologic attributes assessed in the baseline exam
included heel-to-floor time, reaction time, trunk muscle
endurance, limb joint range of motion, sensory loss, and leg
press strength, power, and velocity.
Peak Leg Press Strength, Power, and Velocity
We measured each attribute separately for each leg using
a computerized pneumatic leg press machine (Keiser A420
Pneumatic Leg Press, Keiser Co., Fresno, CA). We deter-
mined the one repetition maximum (1RM) as previously
described (16) and then measured leg muscle power and
strength for five repetitions performed at 40% and 70% 1RM.
We computed leg velocity at peak power by inspecting the
respective analog graphs of power and force and dividing the
recorded peak power by the peak force at peak power.We also
recorded the peak velocity (highest value on velocity analog
graph generated by the computer software) during the repeti-
tion at which peak power was recorded. We determined the
1534 ODONKOR ET AL.
velocity value for each leg at resistances that corresponded to
40% and 70% 1RM. The highest value regardless of side or
percent 1RM was recorded as peak velocity.
Asymmetry of Leg Strength and Leg Power
We measured asymmetry of leg strength as the ratio of
the higher of the leg press strength values over the corre-
sponding value of the other side. Similarly, asymmetry of
leg power was measured as the ratio of the peak leg press
power in a similar fashion (17).
Heel-to-Floor Time and Reaction Time
Heel-to-floor time is a test of rapid leg coordination and
was measured in a seated position as the time to complete
10 repetitions in which the heel of one foot was placed
just below the opposite knee and then back to the floor (7).
Reaction time was measured using a validated computer-
based test in which participants pressed a mouse button
after the appearance of a bright light on a computer screen,
which appeared at random intervals. Participants were
given five practice trials, and reaction time was recorded as
the mean of 10 subsequent measurement trials (18).
Trunk Muscle Extension Endurance
Trunk muscle extension endurance was measured as pre-
viously described (19). Extension endurance was measured
while the participant was lying prone on a specialized plinth
positioned 45° from vertical with feet fixed in position on
a footplate and the body supported below the waist by the
table. The participant maintained their trunk in a neutral
position within the sagital plane in line with their pelvis and
legs for as long as possible with arms across the chest. The
test was terminated when the participant was no longer able
to maintain the unsupported position. Time was recorded in
seconds for all measures (20).
Kyphosis
We measured kyphosis using a flexicurve ruler by a
validated and reliable technique (21).
Joint Range of Motion
We measured knee range of motion, ankle dorsiflexion,
and ankle plantarflexion using a goniometer (10). To evalu-
ate reduced ankle range of motion, decreases in dorsiflexion
and plantarflexion were defined as the inability to dorsiflex
past 90° and plantarflex past 110°, respectively.
Sensory Loss
Sensory loss was measured by the validated Semmes-
Weinstein monofilament test for peripheral sensation (22).
Sensory loss was dichotomized as sensory loss present or
absent (23).
Other covariates included age, gender, education (num-
ber completing  high school grade 12), number of chronic
conditions (via the standardized comorbidity questionnaire)
(24), and body mass index in kilograms per square meter
(estimated from participants' height and weight). All study
procedures were approved by the Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital Institutional Review Board and were well toler-
ated by study participants without occurrence of any associ-
ated injuries or serious adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS version
9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All data were initially
inspected using descriptive statistics. Time to complete the
F8WT and the HGS were treated as continuous variables
(5). Lower limb strength and trunk muscle extension were
normalized per body weight in kilograms. Body mass
index was treated as a categorical variable based on the
standard National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute cut
points for body mass index: normal, less than or equal to
25; overweight, 25­29.9; obese greater than or equal to
30 (25). Comparison of the calculated leg press velocity
with the actual measured peak leg press velocity showed
the former explained more of the variance in both walking
tests, so calculated leg velocity was used in all subsequent
data analyses. We separately examined the bivariate
association between each of the independent variables and
both outcomes. In addition, we tested for the contribution
of different aspects of cognition (Trails A, Trails B, Trails
B - A) to HGS versus F8WT. All potential variables were
evaluated for collinearity. For variables in which collinearity
was present (r  .4), decisions for inclusion were based
upon clinical relevance and strength of association with
the outcomes (eg, asymmetry of leg strength was chosen
over asymmetry of leg power due to its higher association
with the walking tests). Separate multivariable linear
regression models for HGS versus F8WT were generated
by including all potential variables and then employing
a manual backward elimination process, advocated by
Sun and colleagues (26). Based on predefined criteria,
iterative models were evaluated after individually removing
nonsignificant predictors (p  .05) and inspecting to ensure
that their removal did not meaningfully alter the estimates
or standard errors of the retained values (ie, >10% change
in the estimates or standard errors). Age, gender, education,
overweight status, and obese status were retained in both
models because they were deemed to be clinically relevant
adjustment variables. To evaluate the relevance of the
different aspects of cognition, Trails A, Trails B, and Trails
B - A were evaluate within separate multivariable models
for each walking test in order to understand their respective
association with the outcomes. Finally, each multivariable
model was reevaluated to ensure that each satisfied all
statistical assumptions of regression modeling (normal

distribution of residuals, no outliers, no relationship between
residuals and explanatory variables, no multicollinearity,
and no heteroscedasticity). An alpha level less than .05 was
used to determine statistical significance.
Results
Participant baseline characteristics are presented in
Table 1. The study population was 67.7% female, had

chronic medical conditions. The mean HGS of participants
with complete data was 0.94
±
0.23 m/s, and mean time
to complete the F8WT was 8.8
±
2.9 seconds (Table 1).
The mean HGS of participants with missing data was
0.82±0.23 m/s, and the mean time to complete the F8WT
was 10.4
±
4.1 seconds. Demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of participants with missing values compared with
those of participants with complete data showed that both
groups were not significantly different in age, gender, body
mass index categories, college education, pain severity, or
reaction time (Table 2). However, those with missing data
tended to be sicker (higher number of chronic conditions),
had more kyphosis, lower self-efficacy scores, and were 1.8
seconds slower on F8WT and 0.12 m/s slower on the HGS
test, compared with those with complete data.
The F8WT and HGS were strongly correlated with each
other (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = -.67, p < .0001).
Table 3 presents the results of bivariate linear regression
analyses between each of the independent variables and
each of the outcomes.
The adjusted R2 reflects the variance in HGS and F8WT
explained by each model. Physiologic and health attributes
that explained greater than 10% of the adjusted variance
in HGS and F8WT were peak leg press velocity (at peak
power), peak leg press strength, trunk muscle extension
endurance, ankle range of motion, executive function,
and self-efficacy (Table 3). Bivariate analysis evaluating
contribution of different aspects of cognition showed that
Trails A explained 12% of variance in F8WT and 6%
variance in HGS. Although Trails B explained 14% of
the variance in both walking tests, Trails B - A explained
12% variance in HGS and 9% variance in F8WT (Table 3).
Separate multivariable linear regression models were
constructed to determine which physiologic and health/
behavioral attributes contributed to HGS (R2 = .44, p
model
<
.001)andF8WT(R2=.45,p
model
<.001)performance(Table4).
Attributes that achieved statistical significance in the final
model for both walking outcomes were Trails B, trunk
extension endurance, ankle range of motion (reduction in
dorsiflexion and plantarflexion), leg press velocity at peak
power, and sensory loss. Attributes that uniquely achieved
statistical significance with F8WT were reaction time,
heel-to-floor time, self-efficacy, and cognitive processing
speed (Trails A). Pain and peak leg press strength were
significantly associated with HGS performance (Table 4).
In separate models, the derived trails score (Trails B - A)
was associated with HGS but not with F8WT (Table 4).
Discussion
The major findings of our investigation comparing attrib-
utives predictive of HGS and F8WT were (i) that certain
attributes were associated with performance on both tests
(leg press velocity at peak power, trunk muscle extension
endurance, executive function as measured by Trails B,
and ankle range of motion) and (ii) other attributes were
uniquely associated with each respective test. Specifically,
whereas pain severity and peak leg press strength were
associated with HGS performance, self-efficacy, reaction
time, heel-to-floor time, and cognitive processing speed (as
measured by Trails A) were uniquely associated with time
to complete F8WT performance.

One of the intriguing findings from our study concerned
the differences with regard to cognitive testing. We observed
that the Trails B test performance was associated with per-
formance on both walking performance tests. Consistent
with our findings, prior studies have linked certain aspects
of cognition with performance on F8WT and HGS tests
(27). The Trails-making test part B measures cognitive skills
such as attention, working memory, and cognitive flexibility
(all executive functions), as well as psychomotor speed and
visuoperceptual abilities (15,28). Our study findings are
unique in that when the derived trails test (Trails B ­ A) was
utilized (see Table 4), executive cognitive function was no
longer associated with F8WT. The Trails B - A was devel-
oped to diminish the component of processing speed and to
emphasize executive function components (15,29). The one
aspect of Trails B - A, which reflects processing speed, is
more uniquely related to the switch demands of the Trails B
test. Our results suggest that among the cognitive skills we
tested, performance on the F8WT is most sensitive to speed
of cognitive processing in general. This conclusion is sup-
ported by the fact that Trails A, which emphasizes cognitive
processing speed and diminishes executive function, was
significantly associated with F8WT but not with HGS. The
association of straight-path walking with executive function
is well established (30). Our results highlight that curved-
path walking may be sensitive to other aspects of cognition
and reinforce the connection between walking performance
and cognitive processing previously highlighted in an
important review article (30).
These findings with regard to speed of processing with
cognitive tasks are also mirrored by our findings with regard
to the other measured attributes that were uniquely associated
with F8WT performance. Reaction time and heel-to-floor
time (a test of rapid leg coordination) were both uniquely
associated with F8WT performance. These tests measure
rapid movements of the limbs and thus are also speed-
dependent attributes. Our findings suggest that navigation of
a curved path draws upon aspects of both central and periph-
eral components relevant to processing speed. The clinical
implications of the finding should be interpreted in light of
the fact that self-efficacy was also uniquely associated with
F8WT. Reaction time, speed of movement, and self-efficacy
are attributes that have all been linked to falls. For exam-
ple, the ability to catch oneself quickly after a perturbation
is considered to be a very important skill in preventing a fall
or fall-related injury (30). Reaction time and heel-to-floor
time as reflections of limb speed of movement are related
to this ability as well (31). Reaction time has been directly

linked to falls and fall-related injuries (18). The heel-to-floor
test has not yet been evaluated in this context. In addition,
the scores on our self-efficacy measure (Activities-specific
Balance Confidence scale) are predictive of falls (32). Taken
together, our study results suggest that F8WT performance
might be closely related to "central" cognitive­behavioral
attributes (cognitive processing speed and self-efficacy)
and "peripheral" physiologic attributes (reaction time, rapid
coordination, and sensory loss), which are linked to falls and
fall-related injuries (30,33). An evaluation of F8WT as a
predictor of falls outcomes has not been reported, but would
be justified based on these findings.
The findings with regard to leg velocity and leg strength
contrast with our aforementioned results. Leg velocity was
associated with both walking tests; however, leg strength was
only associated with HGS. Both leg velocity and leg strength
are components of leg power (power = force × velocity), an
attribute linked to a variety of physical functional tasks (34).
Leg velocity as measured in our study reflects peripheral
generation of speed of movement at relatively slower speeds
because it is generated against a more substantial resistance
(~40% 1RM). It is likely that this attribute, which is derived
from power generation of the hip extensors and quadriceps,
represents biomechanical aspects of walking that are com-
mon to both tests. The fact that leg strength was uniquely
associated with HGS and not F8WT may also be one expla-
nation for the observed association of pain with HGS and
not F8WT. For example, in HGS, when an individual has
an arthritic or sore limb, they may experience greater pain
because larger forces are being generated across that limb.
Alternatively, the same individual may not have pain influ-
ence on F8WT performance to the same degree because
force production is less influential on performance.
Other possible explanations exist for the unique associa-
tion of pain with HGS. It is possible that different motor
patterns involving hip joint loading, stride length, and
stance adjustments during walking may explain this find-
ing (35). With F8WT performance, the asymmetry of foot
placement, stride length, and stance adjustments needed
to achieve curvilinear walking, likely produces alterations
in limb joint loading throughout the test. In comparison,
during HGS performance, repetition of limb placement in
straight-path walking leads to a repeated pattern of hip and
lower limb joint loading. Thus, a repeated joint loading pat-
tern within a painful joint may bring about a greater per-
formance­pain association than what is observed in F8WT.
Lastly, it is plausible that participants generally walk faster
when going in a straight line but almost everyone slows
down to walk in a curved path because it is a more com-
plex task. Thus, walking faster (during HGS) may be more

painful than slower walking (F8WT). A more detailed bio-
mechanical assessment of these two walking tasks in future
investigations may help explain many of the observed dif-
ferences between HGS and F8WT.
Study Limitations
Our study is cross-sectional, and thus causation cannot
be determined. A prospective study may allow us to better
establish temporal relationships between physiologic attrib-
utes and measures of walking skill. Because we used base-
line data, further understanding of these relationships will
benefit from longitudinal analyses of the attributes influenc-
ing both tests, and importantly how these relate to mobil-
ity limitations among older adults. Additionally, we did not
evaluate certain aspects of F8WT, which other studies have
investigated. These include the amplitude and accuracy
(wideness or narrowness) of the curved path traversed dur-
ing the F8WT, which are components of F8WT that were
not measured in the Boston RISE study. These other aspects
of F8WT performance may also have clinical relevance,
perhaps with regard to the associated cognitive tests utilized
in this study. Thus, we confine our conclusions to a single
aspect of F8WT performance (time for completion).
In addition, although this study screened out those with
moderate to severe dementia, it is plausible that some par-
ticipants had early dementia and this may have influenced
findings with respect to the cognitive measures and the
associated performance on the walking tests.
Finally, we did have missing data. The magnitude of
missing data is consistent with other well-established
cohort studies of community-dwelling older adults (7).
Patients with missing data tended to be sicker (higher num-
ber of chronic conditions), had more kyphosis and smaller
self-efficacy scores, compared with those with complete
data. Importantly, patients with missing data were 1.8
seconds and 0.14 m/s slower on the F8WT and HGS test,
respectively, compared with those with complete data. The
difference in gait speed (>0.10 m/s) suggests that these
individuals were at clinically meaningful lower levels of
function (36). Thus, it may be challenging to extrapolate
our findings to individuals at the lowest levels of functional
performance.
The major strength of this study lies in the large num-
ber of attributes investigated that contribute to walking
performance and the identification of those attributes that
distinguish F8WT and HGS. Although heel-to-floor time
is a relatively new test, first used on a large scale within
a different study (37), both the Activities-specific Balance
Confidence scale and the reaction time test have been linked
to falls (31). Thus, in contrast to HGS, which is advocated
for use among patients at risk for disability and mortality
(4), F8WT may be useful among patients prone to balance
and fall-related problems. Alternatively, given the observed
association between pain and HGS performance, HGS may
be useful in the assessment of older adults undergoing treat-
ment for pain problems. These hypotheses are worthy of
future study.
Conclusions
HGS and F8WT are performance-based walking tests
that are dependent upon a number of different attributes.
Although both tests are associated with tests of cognitive
function, F8WT appears to be particularly sensitive to cog-
nitive processing speed. Reaction time, heel-to-floor time,
and self-efficacy are attributes that are uniquely associated
with F8WT, and HGS is uniquely associated with pain
severity. The use of F8WT or HGS should be considered
based on the clinical context and in light of the attributes
that are uniquely associated with each test. These contrast-
ing findings have important implications for clinicians and
researchers evaluating walking performance among older
adults.
