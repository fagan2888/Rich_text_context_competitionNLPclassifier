Abstract
Previous research has demonstrated that typefaces can convey meaning over-and-above the actual
semantic content of whatever happens to be written. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that
people match basic taste words (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter) to typefaces varying in their
roundness versus angularity. In Experiment 1, the participants matched rounder typefaces with
the word ``sweet,'' while matching more angular typefaces with the taste words ``bitter,'' ``salty,''
and ``sour.'' Experiment 2 demonstrates that rounder typefaces are liked more and are judged
easier to read than their more angular counterparts. We conclude that there is a strong
relationship between roundness/angularity, ease of processing, and typeface liking, which in turn
influences the correspondence between typeface and taste. These results are discussed in terms of
the notion of affective crossmodal correspondences.

Introduction
Recently, a growing body of research has demonstrated that people match taste and flavor
stimuli (as well as taste or flavor words) to shapes in a manner that is consistent across
individuals (e.g., see Wan et al., 2014; see also Spence & Deroy, 2013, for a review).
The roundness/angularity (RA) of shapes appears to be a key element in the crossmodal
matching of tastes to shapes (Velasco, Woods, Deroy, & Spence, 2015a). Research on the
``crossmodal correspondences'' (the name given to the initially surprising tendency to match

seemingly unrelated information across the senses, see Marks & Mulvenna, 2013; Spence,
2011) between tastes and shapes is of particular interest to designers and marketers, as design
elements such as logos, labels, visual imagery, and typefaces can potentially influence a
consumer's expectations concerning food and drink products (see Spence, 2012, for a review).
Typefaces are particularly intriguing in this regard, as they can take on a number of
different forms and can convey meaning over-and-above the actual semantic message of
the text itself (e.g., Doyle & Bottomley, 2009; Morrison, 1986; Poffenberger & Barrows,
1924; Tannenbaum, Jacobson, & Norris, 1964). Indeed, it has been suggested that the
visual features of written words can be processed before their actual meaning and that this
can influence subsequent information processing (e.g., Childers & Jass, 2002, see also Celhay,
Boyselle, & Cohen, 2015). In the context of consumer behavior, this may be of particular
importance given that consumers perceive fonts as being more appropriate for a
given product when both the product and the font have the same connotative meaning
(e.g., Doyle & Bottomley, 2009, as measured using the semantic differential technique; see
Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957). In addition, the semantic appropriateness or
congruency of a product has also been shown to influence people's choice behavior
(Doyle & Bottomley, 2004, see also Doyle & Bottomley, 2006; 2011). This, in turn, points
to the importance of considering font-product semantic consistency in design. Here, we
propose that congruency can also be applied to the relationship between typeface and
taste. Design practitioners have already suggested that typefaces may be used to convey
information about taste or flavor (Hyndman, 2015).
Research on the topic of crossmodal correspondences suggests that the RA of typefaces
can be associated with specific taste words (in a forced choice setting). For example, Velasco,
Salgado-Montejo, Marmolejo-Ramos, and Spence (2014) recently reported that fictional
packages with a brand name that had a rounder typeface (e.g., Swis721 B1kRnd
BT--Black, 44 pt) were more frequently categorized as sweet as compared with packages
with a more angular typeface (e.g., Hollywood Hills--Regular, 53 pt), which was more
frequently categorized as sour instead. Potentially, the RA dimension studied in research
on shape-taste correspondences can be extended to typefaces.
In the present study, we wanted to investigate whether the different design elements of
typefaces (RA, bold, italics, and orientation) would influence participants' associations to
specific basic taste words (bitter, salty, sour, and sweet). Based on the aforementioned
literature, the clear prediction has, at least, to be that rounder typefaces would be
associated with the word sweet. In Experiment 1, we assessed any relationship between
taste words (bitter, salty, sour, and sweet) and different typefaces. Experiment 2 was
motivated by previous research suggesting that taste or shape may be thought of as
affective correspondences (Velasco et al., 2015a), and that there is a relationship between
processing fluency and liking (Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001). Here, we assessed whether the
different typefaces would be consistently rated along RA, as well as liking, and ease of
processing scales.
Experiment 1
Methods and Materials
One hundred and one participants (42 females, mean age ¼ 35.4 years, SD age ¼ 11.15, range
age ¼ 20­69 years) from the United States took part in this study online through the Adobe
Flash-based Xperiment software (http://www.xperiment.mobi, also used in Experiment 2). The
participants were recruited using Amazon's Mechanical Turk in exchange for a payment of
1.00 USD in both Experiments 1 and 2. All were based in the United States, and all agreed to
2 i-Perception 6(4)
take part in the study after reading a standard consent form. The experiment was reviewed and
approved by the Central University Research Ethics Committee at the University of Oxford.
The images of 12 variants of the same text ``eat me'' were written in different typefaces and
were created specifically for the experiments reported here (see Figure 1). Each image was
presented in black and white either alone (71Â 71 pixels) or on a receptacle (85Â 116 pixels),
giving rise to a total of 24 stimuli. The different typefaces were designed to be distinctively round
or angular (Velasco et al., 2014). The typefaces used in the present study are shown in Figure 1.
The first two are Arial (Typeface 1) and Arial bold (Typeface 2), while the remaining 10
correspond to designs made by Sarah Hyndman (http://www.sarahhyndman.com/), a
professional graphic designer, specifically for the purposes of the present experiment. Note
that the first six typefaces are rounder, while the remaining six are more angular.
Through two tasks, the task with typeface and the task with typeface and cup, the
participants had to arrange the different images of the typeface variants of the text ``eat
me'' alone or on a cup, respectively, in terms of the extent to which they thought they
matched bitter, salty, sour, and sweet tastes (see Figure 2, for an example of the task).
The tasks were randomized across participants.

Due to a number of repeated measures analysis of variance assumptions being violated
(e.g., the data were not normally distributed), the rank-based analysis of variance-type
statistic (ATS) was used to analyze the results (see Erceg-Hurn & Mirosevich, 2008), as
implemented in the {nparLD} package in R statistical software (see Noguchi, Gel,
Brunner, & Konietschke, 2012). The significant main effects were further analyzed with the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni correction. Moreover, because our main interest
lay in assessing whether the ratings of each stimulus differed as a function of the taste, we
then analyzed the significant interactions of taste and shape with Friedman's test. After this,
multiple comparisons were performed following Siegel and Castellan's (1988) Formula 7.5a
(pp. 180­181), as implemented in {pgirmess} package in R statistical software. Friedman test
was also used in Experiment 2.
Results and Discussion
Task with typeface. A 4 (taste words) Â 12 (typefaces) ATS was performed. Significant
main effects were obtained for taste, FATS
(2.54, 1) ¼ 7.86, p < .001, and typeface, FATS
(4.36, 1) ¼ 50.03, p < .001. A significant interaction term was also documented, FATS
(8.15, 1) ¼ 54.00, p < .001. Bonferroni-corrected Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed that
sweet ratings were lower than ratings for the other tastes (p < .005, for all comparisons).
The participants also gave higher ratings to the angular (7­12) as compared with the round
(1­6) typefaces (p < .001 for all comparisons). Furthermore, Typeface 7, extremely angular
light, received higher ratings than Typeface 12, angular and contrasting--sloping backwards
(p ¼ .02).
As for the interaction term, a significant difference between the different typefaces was
found for the bitter, 2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 455.85, p < .001, salty, 2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 216.14,
p < .001, sour, 2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 428.48, p < .001, and sweet taste words, 2(11,
n ¼ 101) ¼ 340.68, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons revealed that the participants rated
Typefaces 7 to 12 as more bitter, salty, and sour than Typefaces 1 to 6. In addition, the
participants rated Typefaces 1, 2, and 6 as significantly sweeter than Typefaces 7 to 12,
Typeface 3 as significantly sweeter than 1, 5, and 7 to 12, Typeface 4 as sweeter than 1, 2,
and 5 to 12, and Typeface 5 as sweeter than 7 to 9, 11, and 12 (p < .05, for all comparisons,
see Figure 3(a), for a summary of the results). In other words, the participants rated the
angular typefaces as similarly bitter, salty, and sour, as compared with the round typefaces,
while the later were associated to sweet, as compared with the angular typefaces.
Task with typeface and cup. The analysis revealed significant main effects of taste word, FATS
(2.81, 1) ¼ 5.17, p < .005, typeface, FATS
(4.10, 1) ¼ 41.33, p < .001, and the interaction
between taste word and typeface, FATS
(8.73, 1) ¼ 40.31, p < .001. Here, again, the
participants' sweet ratings were lower than the ratings of the other tastes (p < .01, for all
comparisons). Pairwise comparisons performed on the main effect of typeface also revealed
that the participants gave higher ratings to the angular (7­12) as compared with the round
(1­6) typefaces (p < .001, for all comparisons). Moreover, Typeface 7, extremely angular
light, received higher ratings than Typeface 9, angular and contrasting--sloping forwards,
and Typeface 12, angular and contrasting--sloping backwards (p < .01, for both
comparisons). As for the interaction term, a significant difference between the different
typefaces was observed for the bitter, 2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 314.64, p < .001, salty, 2(11,
n ¼ 101) ¼ 249.80, p < .001, sour, 2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 374.14, p < .001, and sweet taste words,
2(11, n ¼ 101) ¼ 254.32, p < .001. Pairwise comparisons of this task closely replicated those
4 i-Perception 6(4)
of the task with just typeface (see Figure 3(b), for a summary of the results). In addition to the
results reported for the bitter and sour ratings, Typeface 7 was rated as more bitter than
Typeface 12, and as more sour than Typeface 9. As for the sweet ratings, participants rated
Typeface 1 as sweeter than Typefaces 7 and 8, and Typefaces 2 and 5 as sweeter than
Typefaces 7, 8, and 10 to 12. Typefaces 3 and 4 were rated as sweeter than Typefaces 1, 2,
and 5 to 12, and Typeface 6 as sweeter than Typefaces 7, 8, 11, and 12.
The results of Experiment 1 are consistent with previous research in suggesting that round
shapes and typefaces are strongly associated with sweet, while angular shapes and typefaces
are more strongly associated with the other basic taste words (e.g., Velasco et al., 2014, 2015a,
Velasco, Woods, Liu, & Spence, 2015b). One may wonder, however, whether the typefaces
used in our first experiment would consistently be rated as more angular or round. In
addition, one might also consider whether typeface or taste associations can be thought of
Figure 3. Mean ratings in the task with typeface (a), and the task with typeface and cup (b) in Experiment 1.

as a kind of affective correspondence (Marks, 1978; Velasco et al., 2015a). Typefaces are
particularly intriguing in this regard as how easy or difficult they are to process may, in turn,
be related to our preference for them (Gump, 2001; Song & Schwarz, 2008); Stimuli that are
highly fluent have been shown to be associated with positive affect and more positive
judgments (Winkielman, Schwarz, Fazendeiro, & Reber, 2003). Experiment 2 was
conducted in order to assess whether the participants would consistently categorize the
typefaces on a RA scale. The participants also rated how easy or difficult they found it to
read the different typefaces, and how much they liked them.
Experiment 2
Methods and Materials
Ninety nine participants (40 females, mean age ¼ 33.8 years, SD age ¼ 9.8, range age ¼ 18­62
years) took part in this online study. Following the same procedure used in Experiment 1, the
participants were asked to arrange the different typefaces in three different scales or trials:
RA, liking, and legibility (easiness or difficulty to read). The three trials were randomly
presented.
Results and Discussion
The results are summarized in Figure 4. Each variable was analyzed by means of a
Friedman's test. The results revealed a significant difference in liking, 2(11, n ¼ 99) ¼
456.51, p < .001, RA, 2(11, n ¼ 99) ¼ 539.18, p < .001, and legibility ratings, 2(11,
n ¼ 99) ¼ 560.63, p < .001, across typefaces.
Pairwise comparisons revealed that participants liked Typefaces 1 to 6 significantly more
than Typefaces 7 to 12 and Typefaces 9 to 11 more than Typeface 7 (p < .05, for all
comparisons). Moreover, the participants rated Typefaces 7 to 12 as significantly more
angular than Typefaces 1 to 6 and Typeface 5 as more angular than Typeface 4 (p < .05,

liked and considered round and easy to read, whereas Typefaces 7 to 12 were generally liked less and

for all comparisons). Finally, the participants considered Typefaces 7 to 12 to be less easy to
read than Typefaces 1 to 6, Typeface 7 less than Typefaces 9 to 11, Typefaces 8 and 12 less
than 10, and Typeface 3 less than Typefaces 1, 2, 5, and 6 (p < .05, for all comparisons).
Kendall's Tau correlations between RA, legibility, and liking, as a function of the typeface
averages, were also calculated. A significant positive correlation was observed between RA
and legibility (r ¼ .73, p < .001). The more angular the typeface was rated, the less easy it was
to read. In addition, significant negative correlations were observed between RA and liking
(r ¼ À.79, p < .001), and between legibility and liking (r ¼ À.82, p < .001). The more angular
the typeface ratings, the less the participants liked it, and the less easy the typeface was to
read, the less liked it was.
Taste or Typeface Correspondence
Based on the results of Experiment 2, further analysis of the data from Experiment 1 was
conducted in order to determine whether those typefaces that were considered as round as a
whole versus those that were considered as angular would influence taste ratings differently.
Here, the data from the two tasks in Experiment 1 (as the results were virtually the same)
were combined, and the different taste word scores were averaged as a function of the round
(1­6) and angular (7­12) typefaces.1 A 2 (RA: round, angular) Â 4 (taste: bitter, salty, sour,
sweet) ATS revealed a significant effect of RA, FATS
(1.00, 1) ¼ 132.92, p < .001, taste, FATS
(2.51, 1) ¼ 11.12, p < .001, and the interaction between taste and RA, FATS
(2.11,
1) ¼ 116.44, p < .001. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Bonferroni correction revealed that
the angular typefaces received higher taste ratings than the round typefaces (p < .001).
Pairwise comparisons also revealed that, overall, sweet ratings were lower compared with
the other taste ratings (p < .001, for all comparisons). As for the interaction term, a significant
difference was found across taste ratings as a function of round, 2(3, n ¼ 101) ¼ 111.00,
p < .001, and angular, 2(3, n ¼ 101) ¼ 90.97, p < .001, typefaces. The sweet ratings were
significantly higher for the round typefaces, and significantly lower for the angular
typefaces, as compared with the other tastes (p < .05, for all comparisons).
The latter results confirmed what was initially suggested in Experiment 1. The participants
associated round typefaces with sweet tastes and angular typefaces with the other tastes. Note
that rounder typefaces were liked more and were also considered as being easier to read.
In addition, it is well known that people prefer sweet tastes (e.g., Drewnowski, 1997).
It would therefore seem like there is an intrinsic relationship between RA, fluency, and
liking (cf. Bar & Neta, 2006; Collier, 1996), which, in turn, influences the crossmodal
correspondence between such feature and tastes. As Marks (1978, p. 75) puts it some years
ago: ``It just might be that the affective or hedonic dimension of sensation forms, in part, a
basis for qualitative similarities among the senses.''
General Discussion
The present study was designed to assess the way in which people match shapes to taste
words, and typefaces, varying in their RA, to taste words. The results reported here
add weight to the notion that ``sweet'' tends as be associated with round shapes and forms
(Velasco et al., 2015a; 2015b). Furthermore, the results also suggest a clear distinction
between round and angular typefaces, with the former being liked more, considered as
easier to read, and associated with sweet, compared with the latter which were less liked,
considered less easy to read, and associated with the other tastes (e.g., sour, salty, and bitter).
Overall, these results are consistent with previous research showing that there is no apparent
Velasco et al. 7
distinction between bitter, salty, and sour, when participants match them to curvy and
angular shapes (Velasco et al., 2015b).
Why would people match tastes and typefaces varying in their roundness and angularity?
In a recent study, Velasco et al. (2015a) demonstrated that taste hedonics can influence the
way in which people match tastes to shapes. In other words, the more that an individual likes
a taste, the more they will choose a round shape to match it to, and the less they like it, the
more they will tend to associate the taste with an angular shape instead (see also Velasco
et al., 2015b). It has been suggested that this may be related to the idea that people prefer
round objects, as compared with angular objects (e.g., Bar & Neta, 2006; Westerman et al.,
2012).
Crucially, previous research has suggested that the features of typeface convey emotional
meaning, with curved typefaces being associated with more positively valenced emotions and
angular typefaces being associated with more negatively valenced emotions (Kastl & Child,
1968; Morrison, 1986). This, together with the findings of Velasco et al. (2015a; 2015b),
means that it is possible to hypothesize that those who associate curved typefaces with
more positively valenced emotions will be more likely to associate them with sweetness, a
taste that is known for its positive hedonic effect on humans (Drewnowski, 1997; Steiner,
Glaser, Hawilo, & Berridge, 2001).
Therefore, it is possible to think that taste or typeface correspondences may be thought
of as a form of affective correspondence (e.g., Collier, 1996; see also Marks, 1996). The
idea here is that certain cross-sensory matches may be based on a common feeling elicited
by the information presented to two different senses (e.g., music and colors, see Palmer,
Schloss, Xu, & Prado-Leon, 2013; or odors and colors, Schifferstein & Tanudjaja, 2004).
An alternative explanation that is not necessarily incompatible (it should rather be
considered as complementary) with the latter is related to how easy the different
typefaces are to process (this is known as ``processing fluency'', e.g., Song & Schwartz,
2008). Previous research has shown that processing fluency can result in positive affect
(Winkielman & Cacioppo, 2001). That is, stimuli that are easy to process will be
experienced as more pleasing and evaluated more positively than those stimuli that are
hard to process (see also Winkielman et al., 2003). As sweet is considered a pleasant taste,
participants may match it to those typefaces that are easy-to-read and pleasing. The
results of the present study therefore reveal that there is a close relationship between
typeface RA, easiness to read, and liking, which in turn, may explain the
correspondence between taste and typeface RA.
The type of scales that were used in Experiments 1 and 2 may, in part, explain the
clear distinction between round and angular typefaces in all variables. It would therefore
be interesting to use different scales in future research. It would also be important to
assess a participant's familiarity with the typefaces, as there is a relationship between
fluency and familiarity (Westerman, Lanska, & Olds, 2014). While most of the
typefaces used here were novel, one may wonder whether they evoke feelings of
familiarity and whether familiarity also plays a role on the associations between
typeface and taste.
While we did not use actual tastants here, simply by using taste words, it is possible to have
an estimate of the way in which people would match the tastes (Velasco et al., 2015a). It
would be interesting in future research to test such a hypothesis with, for example, flavors or
perfumes. Another interesting direction for future research, and one that would allow for the
testing of the hypothesis forwarded here, would be to assess taste or typeface associations
across languages. Finally, one may also wonder whether specific semantic contents of words

(e.g., cake) written in particular typefaces (round vs. angular) may interact in their
association to taste (perhaps in a Stroop-like fashion).

Note
1. One-sample t tests were performed in order to assess whether the different typefaces would differ
from the midpoint (50) of the RA, liking, and ease-of-reading scales. As expected, Typefaces 1 to 6
were significantly different from the midpoint toward the round end of the scale and Typefaces 7 to
12 toward the angular end of the scale. Moreover, the round (1­6) typefaces were significantly liked
(significantly toward ``like'') and considered easy to read (significantly toward ``easy''), while the
angular typefaces (7­12) were significantly disliked (toward ``dislike'') and considered difficult to
read (significantly toward difficult, p < .01, for all comparisons).
