OBJECTIVE -- This study examined the association between access to health care and three
classifications of diabetes status: diagnosed, undiagnosed, and no diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Using data from the 1999­2004 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we identified 110 "missed patients" (fasting plasma
glucose 125 mg/dl but without diagnoses of diabetes), 704 patients with diagnosed diabetes,
and 4,782 people without diabetes among adults aged 18­64 years. The population percentage
undetected among adults with diabetes and the odds ratio of being undetected among adults who
reported not having diabetes were compared between groups based on their access to health care.
RESULTS -- Among those with diabetes, the percentages having undetected diabetes were
42.2% (95% CI 36.7­47.7) among the uninsured, 25.9% (22.9­28.9) among the insured,
49.3% (43.0­55.6) for those uninsured 1 year, 38.7% (29.2­48.2) for those uninsured 1
year, and 24.5% (21.7­27.3) for those continuously insured over the past year. Type of insur-
ance, number of times receiving health care in the past year, and routine patterns of health care
utilization were also associated with undetected diabetes. Multivariate adjustment indicated that
having undetected diabetes was associated with being uninsured (odds ratio 1.7 [95% CI 1.0­
2.9]) and with being uninsured 1 year (2.6 [1.4­5.0]).
CONCLUSIONS -- Limited access to health care, especially being uninsured and going
without insurance for a long period, was significantly associated with being a "missed patient"
with diabetes. Efforts to increase detection of diabetes may need to address issues of access to
care.
Diabetes Care 31:1748­1753, 2008
In 2005, an estimated 6.2 million
Americans had undiagnosed diabetes
(1). Individuals with undiagnosed type
2 diabetes (type 2 diabetes accounts for
90­95% of all diabetes) have significantly
higher risks for cardiovascular disease
than do individuals without diabetes (2).
Failure to diagnose diabetes prevents pa-
tients from receiving effective treatments
and may have serious consequences, such
as blindness, amputation, cardiovascular
disease, and death (3). Interventions that
can prevent or delay these complications
cannot be promptly applied to patients
with diabetes unless their disease has
been detected (3). Timely detection,
therefore, is of great importance, as it can
reduce the human and economic cost of
diabetes (2).
A recent U.S. Census Bureau report
estimated that 15.9%, or 46.6 million,
of U.S. residents lacked health insur-
ance in 2005 (4). Uninsured adults,
compared with the insured, are much
less likely to receive routine checkups
or preventive services (5), tend to be
more severely ill when diagnosed, and
receive less therapeutic care (6). In ad-
dition to insurance coverage and the na-
ture of coverage (7), absence of a
physician or place for usual source of
care is associated with lack of screening,
follow-up care, and pharmacologic
treatment for hypertension (8). Also,
many insured individuals lack adequate
access to health care or have only inter-
mittent health insurance, and states of
inadequate coverage are associated with
lower use of preventive services (9,10).
The absence of continuous insurance
coverage can have a particularly severe
impact, and a national study found that
adults who were uninsured for a long
period of time reported much greater
unmet health needs than those who
were insured (11). While being poor
and uninsured is associated with de-
layed access to health care (12), higher-
income adults lacking health care
insurance have a decreased use of rec-
ommended health care services, and in-
creased income does not attenuate the
difference in use between uninsured
and insured adults (13). Limited access
to health care not only affects the use of
preventive services (14) but also ele-
vates the risk of a decline in overall
health (15).
To date, few studies have specifically
examined the implications of having in-
adequate insurance coverage among indi-
viduals with diabetes. We have seen,
however, that uninsured adults with dia-
betes are less likely to receive needed care
and to effectively manage their disease,
and those with health insurance have dif-
ficulty obtaining needed care when their
coverage is inadequate (16,17). Medical
organizations have addressed the impor-
tance of detecting diabetes (1,2,18), but
the relationship between access to pre-
ventive services and the likelihood of hav-
ing undetected diabetes has not been
examined. Although two studies (19,20)
investigated the relationship between
socioeconomic status and the detection of
diabetes and found that undiagnosed di-
abetes was not related to education or in-
come, these studies did not examine the
role that access to health care might play
in detecting diabetes. Furthermore, no
previous nationally representative studies
have examined the association of access to
health care with the detection of diabetes.
In examining the relationship be-
tween access to preventive care and unde-
tected diabetes, we sought to explore how
access to health care relates to the detec-
tion of diabetes 1) in the diabetic popula-

tion and 2) in the population who self-
reported not having diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We used cross-sectional
data from the 1999­2004 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), a national population-based
health survey that includes personal inter-
views, medical examinations, and labora-
tory measurements (21).
These analyses were based on data
from adults aged 18­64 years who had
fasted for 8 h. Individuals aged 64
years were excluded because they were
commonly entitled to Medicare, the fed-
eral health care insurance program (96
of 1,988 subjects aged 65 years had
undiagnosed diabetes, of whom only 2
reported no health care insurance cov-
erage). The diabetic population con-
sisted of subjects who answered "yes" to
the question, "Have you ever been told
by a doctor that you have diabetes or
sugar diabetes?" plus subjects who an-
swered "no" but had fasting plasma glu-
cose levels 126 mg/dl. Those who
answered "no" (regardless of fasting
plasma glucose values) made up our
population who self-reported not hav-
ing diabetes.
Access to health care can be consid-
ered a multidimensional concept, includ-
ing availability, organization, financing,
utilization, and satisfaction among the
possible domains (7). In this study, the
measures of access used reflect two of
these five domains: financing and utiliza-
tion (7). Financing was measured by the
following three variables: 1) uninsured, 2)
covered by private insurance, and 3) con-
tinuity of insurance coverage. Classified
as uninsured were those who responded
"no" to the question, "Are you covered by
health insurance or some other kind of
health care plan?" Those who reported
having health insurance (the insured)
were asked, "Are you covered by private
insurance?" Those who responded "yes"
were classified as covered by private in-
surance, and those responding "no" were
considered to have public insurance.
Continuity of coverage was derived from
three questions: "Are you covered by
health insurance or some other kind of
health care plan?", "In the past 12
months, was there any time when you did
not have any health insurance coverage?",
and "About how long has it been since
you last had healthcare coverage?" The re-
sponses were used to create a three-level
variable: continuously insured over the
past year, uninsured 1 year, and unin-
sured 1 year.
Utilization was measured by 1) num-
ber of times the participant received
health care during the past 12 months,
derived from the question, "During the
past 12 months, how many times have
you seen a doctor or other healthcare pro-
fessional about your health at a doctor's
office, a clinic, hospital emergency room,
at home or some other place?" and 2) rou-
tine patterns of health care utilization, de-
rived from the two questions, "Is there a
place that you usually go when you are
sick or you need advice about your
health?" and "What kind of place do you
go to most often: is it a clinic, a doctor's
office, ER, or some other place?"
We controlled for six sociodemo-
graphic variables in our analysis, includ-
ing age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status,
education, and family income. We also
used as covariates BMI (measured as kilo-
grams divided by the square of height in
meters) and a dichotomized version of
self-rated health.
Data analysis
We used two approaches to examine the
relationship between access to health care
and undiagnosed diabetes. First, we fo-
cused on the whole diabetic population
(diagnosed and undiagnosed) and exam-
ined the percentage undetected among
those with diabetes (undiagnosed divided
by diagnosed plus undiagnosed).
Second, we used multivariate logistic
regression models to examine, in the pop-
ulation who self-reported not having dia-
betes the relationship between access to
health care and actually having diabetes.
We restricted this analysis to the popula-
tion who self-reported not having diabe-
tes because diagnosed patients might be
more likely to seek insurance and to use
health care more often than their undiag-
nosed counterparts. In our multivariate
logistic regression models, covariates in-
cluded age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital
status, education, family income, BMI,
and self-rated health.
The sampling weights from the sub-
population of NHANES 1999­2004 par-
ticipants who had fasted in the morning
were utilized in our analyses. Analyses
were conducted using SUDAAN statisti-
cal software (version 9.0.1) (22). We con-
ducted two-tailed t tests for significance
and considered results with a P value of
0.05 to be significant.
RESULTS -- In the subsample of
adults aged 18­64 years who had fasted,
we identified 110 subjects with undiag-
nosed diabetes, 704 who had been diag-
nosed, and 4,782 subjects without
diabetes. Characteristics of participants
for each group was presented in Table 1.
In an analysis adjusted for age, sex,
and race/ethnicity, those with undiag-
nosed diabetes had the least favorable
profile of access to health care among
the three groups (Table 2 ). They were
significantly more likely to be unin-
sured than either of the other two
groups (P  0.01 for both compari-
sons). Similarly, they were more likely
to be uninsured for 1 year than were
these other two groups (P  0.01), and
they were the most likely not to have
received any health care in the past year.
In addition, subjects with undiagnosed
diabetes were more likely than those
with diagnosed diabetes to lack a usual
source of care (P  0.01). If insured,
however, the undiagnosed were more
likely than the diagnosed to be covered
by a private insurance plan.
Percentage undetected among all
people with diabetes
The percentage of those with undetected
diabetes in the diabetic population was
significantly higher among the uninsured
than among the insured (42.2% [95% CI
36.7­47.7] vs. 25.9% [22.9­28.9]) (Fig.
1). Among the insured, the percentage
undetected among those with private in-
surance was significantly higher than
among those with government insurance
(28.5% [25.1­31.9] vs. 17.8% [13.5­
22.1]). Continuity of coverage was asso-
ciated with the percentage undetected.
Here, the highest percentage, 49.3%
(95% CI 43.0­55.6), was among those
uninsured for 1 year, followed by
38.7% (29.2­48.2) among those unin-
sured 1 year and 24.5% (21.7­27.3)
among those insured without discontinu-
ity in the past year.
The number of times that health care
was received in the past year was associ-
ated with having undetected diabetes.
Percentages undetected ranged from
72.8% (95% CI 66.9­78.7) among those
not seeing a health care professional in the
last year to 47.2% (39.8­54.6) among
those who received care just once to
33.1% (26.8­39.4) among those receiv-
ing care two to three times to 16.7%
(13.2­20.2) among those who received
care four times or more. Among those
who usually used clinics and health care

centers for health care purposes, the per-
centage undetected was 31.1% (25.4­
36.8). The percentage undetected was
26.7% (23.3­30.1) in subjects usually us-
ing doctor's offices or HMO facilities. This
percentage was 12.3% (5.6­19.0) in sub-
jects usually using hospital emergency
rooms or hospital outpatient depart-
ments. Among those not using any health
care facility, the percentage undetected
was 66.2% (56.1­76.3).

Access to health care and detection of diabetes
1750 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 31, NUMBER 9, SEPTEMBER 2008
Multivariate analysis
In our multinomial logistic analyses, we
examined the relationship between ac-
cess to health care and failure to detect
diabetes in the population who self-
reported not having diabetes (Table 3).
After we adjusted for age, sex, race/
ethnicity, marital status, education,
family income, BMI, and self-rated
health, we found that compared with
subjects without diabetes, those with
undetected diabetes were significantly
more likely to be uninsured (odds ratio
1.7 [95% CI 1.0­2.9]) and uninsured
for 1 year (2.6 [1.4­5.0]).
CONCLUSIONS -- Having undetec-
ted diabetes puts one's health at substan-
tial risk (1,2), but timely detection of
diabetes is difficult without access to
health care. Using a nationally represen-
tative sample, we found that lack of access
to care significantly elevated the risk of
going undiagnosed. We found that unde-
tected diabetes was related to insurance
coverage, routine patterns of health care
utilization, and continuity of coverage.
The type of insurance and the number of
times a health care professional was seen
in the past year were also associated with
having undetected diabetes. It is also
noteworthy that those with undiagnosed
diabetes were significantly more likely
than those without diabetes to be unin-
sured or to be uninsured for 1 year.
Previous studies (9­11) have indi-
cated that continuity of coverage is even

more important than coverage per se in
determining health status. Similarly, our
study indicated that access to care was
significantly related to the failure to detect
diabetes, and the continuity of access was
also important in determining whether
diabetes would go undetected. In our
study, subjects uninsured for 1 year
were essentially twice as likely as insured
subjects without a break in insurance over
the past year to have undetected diabetes.
Type 2 diabetes, a chronic disease, takes a
long time to develop and reach its diag-
nostic threshold. During the progression
to diabetes, access to primary care plays a
crucial role in its timely detection. The
longer an individual is without insurance
coverage, the longer she or he may go
with undetected diabetes.
We found that those covered by pri-
vate plans were significantly more likely
to be undiagnosed when they actually had
diabetes than were those covered by gov-
ernment insurance. This finding may
seem counterintuitive, but we know that
some private insurance companies pro-
vide limited coverage for preventive care
(17,23), and private coverage tends to be
more discontinuous (24). It is worth not-
ing that some government health plans
(e.g., those offered through the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs) provide rela-
tively effective preventive care for their
enrollees with diabetes (17), and the Vet-
eran's Affairs professional staff may
accordingly be more attuned to recom-
mendations for diabetes screening.
Previous studies (19,20) have not
found a relationship between education
or income and the risk of having unde-
tected diabetes. These studies, however,
did not examine the role played by ac-
cess to health care (another aspect of
socioeconomic status) in the detection
of diabetes. Although we found no sig-
nificant difference by education or in-
come between being diagnosed and
undiagnosed among individuals with
diabetes, our analyses have shown that
access to health care plays an important
role in detecting diabetes.
Although race/ethnicity is related to
diabetes and poor access to care (1,25),
we found no evidence that race/ethnicity
affects the association between access to
health care and detection of diabetes. A
recent study (26), using data from Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
1998­2001, found that individuals of
lower socioeconomic status were at
greater risk for not receiving preventive
care regardless of race/ethnicity and those
without health insurance coverage were
at the greatest risk for not receiving pre-
ventive services. Our findings are consis-
tent with that study. In our model, lack of
access to health care is a predictor for un-
detected diabetes regardless of race/
ethnicity. Our study suggests that access
to health care might be among the most
important predictors for determining
whether diabetes is/is not detected.
Our study has the following strengths:
1)Thedatacomefromanationwidesurvey;
2) sampling weights were incorporated in
the analysis so as to represent the adult U.S.
population; 3) sociodemographic, anthro-
pometric, and health status variables were
controlled for in our analyses; and 4) two
different approaches were used to examine
two different populations, reducing the bias
introduced by the effect of diabetes aware-
ness on the willingness to acquire health
care insurance. Our study has limitations as
well. The major limitation is that the rela-
tively small sample of subjects with undiag-
nosed diabetes makes it difficult to analyze
differences by subgroup between the two
sexes or between different race/ethnicity
groups. Another limitation is that access to
health care was measured by only two of
five domains because of the limited avail-
ability of the survey data.
Our findings demonstrate that lack
of access to health care may result in
missed opportunities to detect diabetes.
The detection of diabetes requires spe-
cific diagnostic tests, e.g., the fasting
plasma glucose test or the oral glucose
tolerance test (or both). These tests are
commonly arranged within a compre-
hensive health care setting that recog-
nizes the risk profiles of its patients.
Without access to comprehensive
health care, patients would be less likely
to receive screening and diagnostic ser-
vices, and, in the end, their diabetes
may be missed by the health care sys-
tem. When they are missed by the
health care system, the problems caused
by those "missed" cases do not disap-
pear. On the contrary, as a study by
Young and Mustard (27) indicated, they
represent the unseen but clinically im-
portant burden of diabetes, with signif-
icant concurrent metabolic derange-
ments and a long-term impact on use of
health care.
With the increases in both the dia-
betic and the uninsured populations in
the U.S., it seems very likely that the num-
ber of undetected cases of diabetes will
increase in the future, with consequent
increases in diabetes-related morbidity
and mortality. This trend cannot be re-
versed until we can increase access to
health care for those Americans who need
it most. Our analyses indicate that limited
health care access, especially being unin-
sured and having a long period without
insurance, is associated with being a
"missed patient" with diabetes. Those
making an effort to increase the timely
detection of diabetes should consider is-
sues related to health care access.
