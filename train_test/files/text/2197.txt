Introduction
Obesity is a major public health problem with numerous conse-
quences, including reductions in life expectancy (1) and qual-
ity-of-life (2). Food insecurity has emerged as an important
factor that may contribute to the disproportional development
of obesity in those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds
(3). Food security is defined by the United States Department
of Agriculture (USDA) as "access by all people at all times to
enough nutritious food for an active, healthy life" (4). In the
latest USDA data from 2009, 14.7% of American households
were food insecure, with higher proportions reported by
households with children headed by a single woman (37%)
and by blacks (25%) and Hispanics (27%) (5).
Foodinsecurityhasbeenlinkedtoincreasedweightinseveral
studies (6), a phenomenon known as the "food insecurity-obes-
ity paradox" (7). Individuals who experience food insecurity
may alternate between periods of hunger and consumption
of high-calorie or high-fat foods to avoid hunger, as nutrient-
poor energy-dense foods cost less than lean meats, vegetables,
and fruits (8). These compensatory strategies employed during
food adequacy and shortage, in combination with constrained
dietary options of lesser nutritional value, may in turn lead to
cyclic weight gain (9). Several studies have found that women
reporting food insecurity are more likely to be overweight or
obese compared to women who are food secure (10­16). Food
insecurity has been investigated less frequently in men; some
studies have found an association with BMI (14) while others
have not (10,13). The data in children and adolescents are also
mixed (17­22).
Although the reasons for a stronger effect of food insecu-
rity on women are unclear, two potential explanations include
women's greater participation in the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) and role in childrearing. The
USDA administers the SNAP, formerly known as the Food
Stamp Program, to help address issues of hunger and food
insecurity (23). Notably, several studies have found higher
rates of overweight and obesity in food insecure (24,25) and
low-income (26,27) adults receiving food stamps compared
to those not participating in the program. As hypothesized
by Dinour and colleagues (7), some women may sacrifice
their own nutritional resources in order to protect their chil-
dren from hunger. Although several studies have focused on
the relationship between food insecurity and obesity in small
populations of women with children (11,12), we are unaware
of studies assessing the affects of receipt of supplemental
nutrition or having children in the home on the relationship
between food insecurity and BMI in a large cohort of women
of childbearing age.
Food Insecurity and Increased BMI in Young
Adult Women

Food insecurity has been associated with weight status in children and adults although results have been mixed.
We aimed to identify whether food insecurity was associated with BMI in young adults and whether this association
differed by gender and was modified by food stamp use and the presence of children in the home. Cross-sectional
data from wave 4 (2007­2008) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health were analyzed. Multiple linear
regression was used to investigate the association between food insecurity and BMI in gender stratified models of
young adult women (n = 7,116) and men (n = 6,604) controlling for age, race/ethnicity, income, education, physical
activity, smoking, alcohol use, the presence of children in the home, and food stamp use in young adulthood and/
or adolescence. Food insecurity was more common in young adult women (14%) than young adult men (9%). After
controlling for a variety of individual variables, food insecure women had a BMI that was on average 0.9kg/m2 units
higher than women who were food secure. This difference in BMI persisted after controlling for recent or past food
stamp use and was not different among women with or without children in the household. No relationship was found
between food insecurity and BMI in young adult men. Providers should inquire about food insecurity, especially when
treating obesity, and policy initiatives should address the role of access to healthy food in those facing food insecurity.

Epidemiology
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health), a nationally representative sample of over 15,000 par-
ticipants surveyed prospectively from adolescence into young
adulthood, offers a unique opportunity to further clarify these
relationships between food insecurity and obesity. As young
adulthood is a time of transition to self-sufficiency as well as
a critical time point in the establishment of adult obesity (28),
this age group may be particularly vulnerable to food insecu-
rity and its effects on weight. Add Health also includes par-
ticipants from a wider variety of racial and ethnic groups than
previously studied and includes important data on parenting
as well as receipt of supplemental assistance in young adult-
hood and adolescence. This study uses data from Add Health
to clarify the relationship between food insecurity and BMI by
investigating whether food insecurity is differentially associ-
ated with BMI in young adult men and young adult women
and whether a history of receiving food stamps or the presence
of young children in the household modifies any association
between food insecurity and BMI.
Methods and Procedures
Participants
This study uses data from the fourth Wave of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (n = 15,701), a nationally representative
school-based study of adolescents enrolled in grades 7­12 at initial
recruitment. Wave I data were collected in 1994­1995 and wave IV
data in 2007­2008, when the participants were aged 24­32. Informed
consent was obtained at wave I and the study was approved by the insti-
tutional review board at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill
(29). Participants with missing data for sample weights were excluded
(n = 901) because it was not possible to take into account the complex
survey design for these individuals. Those currently pregnant (n = 487)
were excluded due to concern that their weight status might be influ-
enced by factors different than in the nonpregnant population. Those
with height <58 inches or >84 inches, as well as those with weight <80
lbs or >440 lbs (the maximum capacity of the scale used to weigh par-
ticipants), were also excluded due to concerns about biologic plausibil-
ity or measurement error (n = 264). In addition to these exclusions,
those who had missing data for either the dependent variable or for any
of the key independent variables were excluded (n = 329). Because there
was a high nonresponse rate for income (~7%), income was imputed by
Gaussian normal regression in order to avoid selection bias. After this
imputation and all exclusions, the final sample contained 13,720 young
adults (87.4% of wave IV participants).
Outcome measurements
Outcome variable. BMI (weight (kg)/height (m2)) was the outcome
variable. BMI was calculated from measured weight and height when
available (98%) and from self-report in the small number of partici-
pants missing measured height and weight.
Primary predictor variable. The primary predictor variable of inter-
est was self-report of food insecurity. Participants were asked "In the
past 12 months, was there a time when (you/your household were/
was) worried whether food would run out before you would get
money to buy more?" to which they responded yes or no. There was
a 99.9% response rate for this question. This question is the first item
in the 18-item US Household Food Security Scale (30) and a positive
response indicates individuals are either marginally food secure or
food insecure (Mark Nord, Economic Research Service, USDA, per-
sonal communication). For the purposes of this analysis we will con-
tinue to use the term "food insecure" to refer to those with a 
positive
response.
Additional independent variables. Race/ethnicity was constructed
from two questions from the third wave of the study regarding racial
identity and whether participants were of Hispanic/Latino origin, as
these questions were not asked at wave IV. Six racial/ethnic categories
were constructed based on participant responses: white, black/African
American, Hispanic, American Indian/Native American, Asian/Pacific
Islander, and multiracial. Participant report of household income was
constructed as the midpoint of the income category chosen by the par-
ticipant. Income was imputed using the Gaussian normal regression
imputation method for those 835 participants who either refused to
answer the income question or stated they did not know. The house-
hold income variable was then transformed into a continuous measure
that was a ratio of household income relative to the poverty level in
2008 (31) based on the number of household members reported by the
participant.
The highest level of education achieved by the participant was collapsed
into four categories: less than high school (8th grade or less or some high
school), high school graduate, some college (some college or vocational/
technical training beyond high school), and college graduate (completed
college, some graduate school, or a masters or doctoral degree). Physical
activity was calculated as the sum of the number of physical activity epi-
sodes reported in a typical week, with a range of 0­49 activities. Activity
duration and intensity data were not available. Smokers were designated
as those currently smoking tobacco on >10 days in the proceeding 30
days. Alcohol users were identified as those consuming alcohol on 1 or
more days a week in the past 30 days. Participants were coded as having
dependent children at home if they reported any sons/daughters (biologi-
cal, adopted, foster, or step-children) currently living in their household.
Food stamp use/public assistance was considered present at wave 4 if the
participant reported receiving any public assistance, welfare payments,
or food stamps in the intervening years because the prior wave in which
they were surveyed. Food stamp use was considered present at wave 1 if
the mother or legal guardian reported that the household had received
food stamps in the prior month. Data regarding the duration of time
participants received food stamps was not available.
Statistical analysis
All analysis was performed using STATA SE 10.0 (Stata, College Station,
TX). Survey sampling weights were applied to account for the unequal
likelihood of certain subpopulations being sampled. Bivariate analyses
of the covariates of interest with the primary predictor variable were
done to test for significant relationships with 2-tests for categorical var-
iables and simple linear regression for continuous variables. A multiple
linear regression model was created to assess the association between
food insecurity and BMI controlling for potential confounders in the
overall sample. Confounders were identified as those variables associ-
ated with both food insecurity and BMI in bivariate analysis or based on
empiric evidence. Interaction terms were then created and added based
on either evidence from the literature or a priori hypotheses regard-
ing the differential effect of food insecurity for certain populations (i.e.,
females, those raising children, those with an income <200% of the
federal poverty level). Results were then stratified by gender based on
evidence from the literature for a differential association between food
insecurity and weight in women and men (10) and based on the signifi-
cance of the interaction term for gender and food insecurity in the full
model. Regression diagnostic procedures showed no evidence of multi-
collinearity, heteroscedasticity, or substantial influence from outliers.
Results
The average age in this sample was 28.9 years. Females com-
prised 48% of the total population and males 52%. The racial
and ethnic makeup of the sample was similar to that of the
US population, with 66% of participants reporting they were
white, 16% African American, 12% Hispanic, 4% Asian, and
2% American Indian. Thirty percent were college graduates

and the average household income was $60,000. Forty-five
percent of participants had at least one child living in their
household. Thirty-two percent were smokers, 31% consumed
alcohol on a weekly basis, and participants reported an average
of 6 physical activities/week.
The demographic characteristics of those participants who
did and did not report food insecurity are listed in Table 1,
stratified by gender. Significantly more female participants
reported food insecurity than male participants (P < 0.001).
Food insecurity was more prevalent in African Americans
and American Indians compared to whites. Food insecurity
was also associated with lower income and lower educational
attainment and a greater likelihood of having received public
assistance or food stamps. Food insecurity was significantly
more likely to be reported by women with children in their
household and by individuals who smoked and who did not
consume regular alcoholic beverages. P values for most asso-
ciations were <0.001.
Among female participants, food insecurity was positively
associated with BMI (Table 2). Those who reported food inse-
curity had BMIs that were on average 2.39kg/m2 higher than
those who did not report food insecurity (Table 2, model 1).
This relationship was attenuated to 0.9kg/m2 but remained
significant after controlling for other demographic and health
behaviorvariablesassociatedwithbothfoodinsecurityandBMI
including age, race/ethnicity, education, household income,
smoking status, alcohol use, and physical activity (Table 2,
model 2). However, among male participants we found no asso-
ciation between food insecurity and BMI (Table 3).
Food insecurity was significantly associated with receipt
of public assistance in adolescence and in young adulthood
(P < 0.001, Table 1). However, neither recent receipt of pub-
lic assistance/food stamps nor past receipt of food stamps in
adolescence modified the relationship between food insecurity
and BMI in either females or males (Tables 2 and 3, model
3). Although the presence of dependent children in the house-
hold was associated with a lower BMI in young adult women
(Table 2, model 4), the interaction between food insecurity and
the presence of children was nonsignificant (Table 2, model 4).
Given reports in the literature regarding increased effects of
food insecurity on low-income individuals (32), we restricted
our analysis to those reporting a household income <200% of
the federal poverty level and found no significant change in the
associations (data not shown). There was also no effect modi-
fication of the relationship between food insecurity and BMI
by educational attainment or race/ethnicity for either gender
(data not shown).
Discussion
This is the first study to demonstrate that food insecurity is
associated with increased BMI in a nationally representative
racially diverse sample of young adult women after controlling
for age, race/ethnicity, education, income, physical activity,
smoking, and alcohol use. Furthermore, this relationship per-
sists after controlling for food stamp use and the presence of
children in the household. Although other studies have found

that food insecurity differentially affects individuals from vari-
ous racial and ethnic backgrounds (16,19) or only those below
the federal poverty level (32), we did not find an interaction
between food insecurity and race/ethnicity nor income in this
population. This study does not find an association between
food insecurity and BMI among young adult men.
This differential association in men and women is consist-
ent with findings from previous studies in other populations
(6) but the reason for the differential association between
food insecurity and weight status in men and women remains
unclear. Although others have hypothesized that food insecure
women preferentially give available nutritious food to their
children and are thus more apt to consume lower quality foods
or alternate between overeating and hunger (7), we did not
find an interaction between food insecurity and the presence
of children in the home in this large cohort of participants of
childbearing age. While women are more likely to participate
in SNAP or other supplemental nutrition programs, we also
did not find evidence of an association between food stamp
use and BMI, nor a differential effect of food insecurity on BMI
in those participants who did and did not report food stamp
use in adolescence or young adulthood. It is possible that
food insecure women make different nutritional choices than
food insecure men and other food secure adults. There may
also be genetic or hormonal differences that lead food inse-
cure women to increase their adiposity stores in response to
alternating periods of food scarcity and abundance (33). These
remain areas for future research.
There are several important limitations to this study. First,
this study used a single-item question to assess food insecurity.
The USDA publishes both the full 18-item US Household Food
Security Scale and a validated 6-item short form for the assess-
ment of food insecurity in adults (30). Our measure is the first
itemonbothoftheseformsandisconsideredthemostinclusive
question. While it is the least severe measure of food insecu-
rity (34), recent work has demonstrated that this one question
has a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 85% for detecting
food insecurity as measured by the gold standard 18-item US
Household Food Security Scale (35). Furthermore, using only
this question is likely to underreport food insecurity so results

remain conservative (Mark Nord, Economic Research Service,
USDA, personal communication). Second, questions regarding
participation in the SNAP differed across waves, referencing
imprecise lengths of time and sometimes including exposure
to other public assistance programs, and data were collected
before important revisions to the program in 2008. Finally, this
is a cross-sectional study and therefore a causal relationship
between food insecurity and BMI in young women cannot be
demonstrated by this analysis. We were unable to investigate
the longitudinal effects of food insecurity as this measure was
only added in Wave 4 of data collection. Analyzing longitudi-
nal effects of food stamp exposure was also not possible due the
measure changing as noted above. Future waves of Add Health
should retain the food insecurity question in order to assess
the effect of ongoing, new-onset, or resolved food insecurity
on weight gain as participants continue to age into adulthood.
In conclusion, food insecurity is related to BMI in this sam-
ple of diverse young adult women, but not in young adult men.
Providersshouldaskpatientsaboutfoodinsecuritywhenassess-
ing and treating overweight and obesity, especially in women. A
simple two-question screen is likely adequate with affirmative
responsestoeitherquestionconcerningforfoodinsecurity(35).
Providers should refer patients with identified food insecurity
to appropriate social services and should also provide informa-
tion regarding how to choose healthy foods from these pro-
grams. Recent innovations in food assistance programs, such
as the doubling of SNAP benefits if used at farmers markets or
the elimination of sugar sweetened beverages from some food
banks, may help to mitigate the adverse effects of food inse-
curity on weight. Future policy initiatives aimed at combating
overweight and obesity should address the role of food insecu-
rity with similar creative solutions that preferentially subsidize
nutritious over unhealthy foods. Further studies are needed to
assess the longitudinal relationship between food insecurity
and weight status throughout the lifespan and to elucidate the
mechanisms by which food insecurity impacts BMI.
