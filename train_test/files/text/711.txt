Carcinoma

Background. Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin-
flammatory drugs (NSAIDs)have been shown experimen-
tally to inhibit chemically induced esophageal cancers.
An epidemiologicstudyof more than 600,000adultsin the
United States followed for 6 years found that aspirin use
was associated with a reduced risk of death from esopha-
geal cancer.
Methods. The relation of aspirin use and esophageal
cancer was examined using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 1)
and the National Epidemiologic Follow-up Studies
(NEFS).Of the 14,407United States residents followed for
12-16 years, esophageal cancer developed in 15.Persons
were classified as nonusers, occasional users, or regular
users of aspirin based on their response to two questions
at the baseline examination: whether they had taken as-
pirin in the past 30 days and whether they had used pain
medications regularly during the prior 6 months.
Results. Occasional use was associated with a 90%
decreased risk (95% confidence interval,0.01-0.76)of de-
veloping esophageal cancer,and no person classified as a
regular user developed the disease. Adjusting for ciga-
rette smoking (ever vs. never) and alcohol intake (at least
monthly vs. not)did not explain the finding.
Conclusion. Aspirin use was associated with a 90%
decreased risk of developing esophageal carcinoma. Fur-
ther studies to determine whether aspirin is protective
against both squamouscell esophageal carcinoma and ad-
enocarcinoma of the esophagus are indicated. Cancer

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs)have been shown experimentally to inhibit
prostaglandin synthesis and tumor growth in a wide va-
riety of systems.' NSAIDs such as aspirin, indometha-
cin, piroxicam, and sulindac inhibit chemically induced
esophageal cancers.' Previous studies have examined
the relation of aspirin use to colon cancer, with discrep-
ant finding^.^-^ Although no previous epidemiologic
study has examined the relation of aspirin use to the
development of esophageal carcinoma, a previous
study of more than 600,000 adults in the United States
followed for 6 years found that aspirin use was associ-
ated with a reduced risk of death from these tumors.'
The goal of the present study was to examine the rela-
tion of aspirin use to development of esophageal cancer
in another cohort of U.S.residents, which had been fol-
lowed 12-16 years.
Methods
Study Population
The first National Health and Nutrition Examination
Study (NHANESI)was a survey of a national probabil-
ity sample of noninstitutionalized persons in the U.S.,
conducted between 1971and 1975.NHANESI subjects
were followed with the National Health Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study (NEFS), which attempted to rein-
terview and obtain health outcomes for the 14,407per-
sons aged 25 to 74 years at baseline." The NEFS con-
sists of three waves of follow-up conducted in 1982-
84, 1986, and 1987. " The 1987 follow-up data were
collected during interviews with subjects or their prox-
ies, from health care facility records, and from death
certificates.I2For the present study, we excluded 349
persons from the group of 14,407 who reported a his-
tory of cancer at baseline, seven with missing cancer
data, 611 for whom no follow-up information was
available,and 140who died within 1year of follow-up,
leaving a total of 13,300subjects, a group referred to as
the "cohort" hereafter. In all, 21.9% of the cohort were
dead at the time of the 1987follow-up.

Patient Definition
Patients were persons whose first cancer diagnosis, at
least 1 year after baseline, was esophageal cancer (In-
ternational Classificationof Diseases code 150).Fifteen
subjects were diagnosed w:ithesophageal cancer, all of
whom had died by the time of the 1987 follow-up
study.
Aspirin Data
At the baseline examination, persons were asked
whether they had taken aspirin in the past 30 days, and
if so, the number of days previous to the examination
that they had taken it. Baseline aspirin data were avail-
able for 99.1% of the cohort and for 93.3% of the pa-
tients. Subjects were also queried briefly at baseline
concerning use of medications for headaches and other
pains during the previous 6 months. Subjects were
asked whether they used pain medicationsnever, occa-
sionally, or regularly. This information was available
for all but six members of the cohort and for all of the
patients. Subjectswere not asked specificallywhat pain
medicationsthey used or how much or how often they
used these medications.
Potential Confounders
Demographic information ;aboutage, race, and sex was
ascertained at the baseline examination for all subjects,
as was data on alcoholconsumption. Information about
smoking habits was obtained for about one-fourth of
the subjects at baseline and for nearly three-fourths
during the 1982-84 follow-up survey. Information
about smoking habits was available for 69.5% of the
cohort and for 93.3% of tlhe patients. Information on
alcoholconsumption was available for 99.8% of the co-
hort and for all of the patie:nts.
Data Analysis
Incidence rates were estimated according to whether
subjectsreported any use of aspirin in the month before
the baselineinterview and whether or not they reported
regular use of pain medications during the 6 months
before baseline. Esophageal cancer rates for subjects
with three different levels of aspirin exposure were
compared with rates for nonusers of aspirin. We classi-
fied subjects as nonusers if they reported no use of as-
pirin in the month before b,aselineand no regular use of
pain medications during the previous 6-month period.
We classified subjects as occasional users of aspirin if
they said they used aspirin in the month before baseline
but reported no regular use of pain medications during
the previous 6 months. We classifiedsubjectsas regular
users of aspirin if they reported both using aspirinin the
month before baseline and regularly using pain medi-
cations during the previous 6 months. We used infor-
mation about subjects' general use of pain medications
in classifying subjects as regular aspirin users because
aspirin accounted for about three-quarters of the adult,
nonsinus analgesicssold over the counter in the United
States at the time of the baseline e~amination.'~
To as-
sess the categorization of regular and occasionalaspirin
use, we looked at the number of days before the base-
line examination that the subjects had taken aspirin:
82%of regular users and 56% of occasional users had
taken aspirin within the past 3 days.
Person-time was defined as the time from date of
baseline examination to date of diagnosis for patients
and to last date known alivefor the cohort. Person-time
for patients ranged from 3 to 13 years, and, for the co-
hort, from 1to 16years. Stratifiedanalysis and Poisson
regressionwere used to estimaterate ratios, adjusted for
age, race, and gender, for various levels of aspirin use.
We also used Poisson regression to assess confounding
effects of alcohol consumption (at least monthly versus
not) and cigarette smoking (ever versus never smoked
regularly). Subjectswith missing values were excluded.
When there were no patients in the exposure category,
the upper bound of an exact 95% confidence interval
was calculated using the BIN20M software routine.l4
All other analyses were performed using the SASstatis-
tical package.15
Results
Demographics of the patients differedfrom those of the
entirecohort. The patients were significantlyolder, with
a mean age of 59 versus 49 years (P < 0.01). A higher
proportion of the patients was male (100% vs. 41%, P
< 0.001), and a higher proportion was Black (47% vs.
16%, P < 0.001). A higher proportion of the patients
had smoked cigarettes (86%vs. 76%,P = 0.480), and a
higher proportion drank alcohol at least monthly (86%
vs. 55%, P = 0.004).
The distribution of the patients and cohort accord-
ing to use of aspirin and pain medications is presented
in Table 1. Presented in Table 2 are rate ratio estimates
from Poisson regression; they were virtually identicalto
those from stratifiedanalysis. Compared with nonusers
of aspirin, occasional, mixed (occasional and regular),
and regular users of aspirin, all had strong decreased
risks of developing esophageal cancer. The association
was similarfor mixed and occasionalusers, but stronger
for regular users, though the latter was not statistically
significant. As shown in Table 2, adjusting rate ratios
for alcohol use and smoking, in addition to age, race,
and sex, strengthened all rate ratio estimates. When we
included alcohol use and smoking separately in regres-

sion models, alcohol alone had no effect on estimates,
whereas smoking strengthened the associations (sepa-
rate estimatesnot presented).Mortalityrate ratios were
also estimated. These were identical to the incidence
rate ratios, an expected finding because all the patients
had died.
Discussion
We found that aspirin use was associated with a sub-
stantially decreased risk of developingesophageal car-
cinoma. We found a relation between the amount of
aspirin consumed and the risk of esophageal cancer,
with risks lowest for regular users of aspirin.
A limitation of the present study is that it is based
on a relativelysmallcohort,which yielded a smallnum-
ber of patients. However, in spite of the small number
of patients, we found a statisticallysignificant80-9070
reduction in the incidence of esophageal cancer for as-
pirin users. Our findingsare consistentwith those from
the Cancer Prevention Study 11, the only previous epi-
demiologicstudy that investigatedthe relation of aspi-
rin use to esophageal cancer.' Those investigators re-
ported a 40% lowermortalityrate from esophagealcan-
cer among subjects who reported using aspirin 16 or
more times per month comparedwith never usersand a
20%lowermortalityrate among subjects who reported
using aspirin 1-15 timesper month.' Our study, aswith
most follow-up studies assessing the development of
cancer,undoubtedly has considerable censoringon the
outcome of interest. However, we do have a substan-
tially longer follow-up than the Cancer Prevention
Study 11, 12-16 years and six years, respectively,which
means less censoring.
Theprimary difficultyin studyingthe relation of as-
pirin use to esophageal cancer is obtaining an accurate
measure of use before tumor induction. This is espe-
cially a problem in case-controlstudiesbecause the dis-
ease process may change aspirin consumption, and
thus, may affect the aspirin use reported by patients.
However, this differential misclassification of aspirin
use should not be a problem in the current study be-
cause of its cohortdesignand because we excluded any
patient diagnosed within 1 year of the baseline in-
terview.Theearliestdiagnosisof the remainingpatients
was 3 years after baseline examination.
Althoughthere should be no differentialbias in the
way subjects reported their aspirin use, there may still
be misclassilication.It is reasonableto assume that per-
sons who used aspirin regularly would report using as-
pirin in the past month; however, the converse is not
true. To address this problem, we also analyzed sub-
jects' general use of pain medications during the 6
months before the baseline interview. Our combined
measures of aspirin and of general pain medication use
allowed subjects to be divided into fairly broad group-
ings as nonusers, occasional, mixed, and regular users
of aspirin, classificationsthat should be reasonably ac-

curate for that time period. Thisassessment of accuracy
is supported by the high percentage of regular users
(82%) having taken aspirin within the past three days
compared with a lower percentage (56%)of occasional
users.
Subjects may have changed their aspirin use after
the baseline interview; however, this is unlikely to be a
problem in the present study for the followingreasons.
Half of the patients were diagnosed within 8 years after
the baseline interview, three-fourths within 11 years,
and because the latency period for esophageal cancer is
likely to exceed 11years, the majority of patients in this
study shouldhave had tumors that were induced before
the baseline interview. Thus, even if the aspirin use of
the subjects changed over time, this study is based on
those measures of aspirin use most relevant to the etiol-
ogy of esophageal cancer.
It is possible that confounding could contribute to
the associationsreported here, but it seemsunlikely that
confounding could account for the consistent and
strong associations that we report. The two strongest
risk factors for esophageal cancer are alcohol consump-
tion and cigarette smoking. Although we were able to
adjust only crudelyfor these confounders, these adjust-
ments either had no effect on rate ratio estimates or
strengthened them.
Worldwide, esophageal cancer is the seventh most
common cancer,with especiallyhigh incidencerates re-
ported in regions of Brazil, France, China, Japan, and
the former Soviet Of cancer deaths in the
United States, esophageal ranks fourth in importance
for African American males and ninth for White
males." In 1995 in this country, an estimated 12,100
new cases will occur, and 10,900persons will die from
the disease.19This is one of the most fatal of all cancers
in the US.with only 5.9% of African American males
and 7.5% of White males surviving more than 5 years
after diagnosis.
Aspirin and related NSAIDS may have some po-
tential to inhibit either squamouscarcinomasof the up-
per esophagus or adenocaiccinomaof the distal esopha-
gus, which previous studies indicate may have different
etiologies.*"Our results support further studies to de-
termine whether aspirin is protective against both of
these forms of esophageal cancer. Such studies could
lead to clinicaltrialsto determine whether aspirin might
be used in high risk groups, such as patients with Bar-
rett's syndrome, to prevent this rapidly fatal cancer, a
disease for which treatment is generally only palliative.
