Abstract
Academic debates on union politics in the Global South have tended to focus on
effective union and solidarity campaigns. Labour struggles, however, do not always
yield beneficial outcomes for workers. Three decades of neo-liberal policies in Sri
Lanka suggests complexities that labour rights advocates would potentially prefer to
shy away from. Efforts to re-politicize union rights of labour in an era of economic
liberalization require us to sharpen our gaze on these ruptures too. Using work-
place ethnography in Sri Lanka, this article details the interactions of management
and labour during a struggle over union formation. It suggests that paying detailed
attention to the political economy of labour highlights a complex situation in which
fostering unionization, despite its importance for the collective will of labour, may
require hard work.

Introduction: The freedom to associate via ethical codes?
`Garments without Guilt' is a flagship programme marking the Sri Lankan apparel
industry's place in the global economy, where its lexicon is that it is evangelical
about producing garments with a conscience. Championing ILO core conventions
and staying steadfast to Sri Lankan national labour regulation are the mechanisms
through which the Sri Lankan apparel industry claims to divest guilt from its
production process. Yet the Garments without Guilt website is spectacularly

silent regarding ILO core conventions 87 and 98, which pertain to the right of
workers to associate and engage in collective bargaining ­ despite Sri Lanka being a
signatory to these conventions (http://gwg.garmentswithoutguilt.com/about-gwg/
38). Unsurprisingly, therefore, a recent global union report points to the continued
failures in the Sri Lankan apparel industry, noting workers' inability to freely
associate and enter collective bargaining agreements (ITGLWF, 2011). This finding
is not unusual against a worldwide backdrop within which there is widespread
acknowledgement that workers' ability to unionize is severely tested and thwarted,
despite various corporate and multi-stakeholder initiatives incorporating an ethical
code that aims to protect rights and standards of labour (Hale and Shaw, 2001;
Elias, 2005; De Neve, 2008; Hensman, 2011).
Using workplace ethnography, this article details the intricacies of management-
labour interactions within the shop floor of a clothing factory in Sri Lanka, during
and after efforts to frustrate unionization. My purpose is to signal how global
governance regimes do not operate in a socio-cultural vacuum and to suggest
that uncovering factory floor politics offers an important lens through which
labour struggles and code deployment in the realm of freedom of association
should be understood. Labour geography requires us to not simply rejoice at
labour gains but also trace worker ambivalence towards collective action so that
we can be attentive to the paradoxical ways in which labour is actively involved in
the processes of globalization. In this Sri Lankan context competing loyalties of
workers coupled together with the lack of durable commitment by segments of
workers to union presence and politics also influenced the eventual faltering of a
spontaneous uprising. My article, hence, shows that unionization efforts are riddled
with intricacies which need drawing out; these multifaceted challenges are import-
ant to acknowledge if we want to honestly broker workers' right to freely associate
and express their collective will. As I show in the pages to follow, three decades of
neo-liberal policies in Sri Lanka have begun to reverberate in the form of a mistrust
of unions and an increasingly individualized politics on the part of workers. Union
activity of politicizing and re-politicizing workers on issues relating to their col-
lective rights then needs to navigate a landscape which is not merely about outing
or outwitting heavy-handed management tactics but also about candidly apprais-
ing existing strategies around unionization ­ and probing their drawbacks.
A prolegomenon to freedom of association
Difficulties of monitoring and regulating freedom of association are often noted as
one of the weakest links in the ethical global governance regime (Hale and Shaw,
2001; Hensmen, 2005). Despite corporate codes of conduct coming to the fore as a
possible means by which labour standards can be improved, Elias (2005) notes how
corporate-led governance regimes are unlikely `to challenge meaningfully the struc-
tural inequalities' faced by workers (2005: 217). Since corporations are implicated
in producing `structures of control and inequality that characterise global produc-
tion', she points to the naivety of assuming that corporate codes of conduct can be
Ruwanpura 119
a panacea in all spheres of labour politics (2005: 218). Freedom of association is
likely to moderate inherent power imbalances in management-labour relations, and
hence corporations are seen as falling short on scrutinizing this right because it is
likely to undermine corporate control over the supply chain (Anner, 2012: 610).
For Anner (2012), corporate retailer enthusiasm to monitor minimal labour stand-
ards, such as child labour or overtime wage payments, does not convert into
upholding labour rights, namely freedom of association and as a consequence
collective bargaining declines (2012: 614). Using data sets of the Fair Labour
Association (FLA), he shows the distinctions in emphasis of global governance
regimes between labour standards and rights. De Neve (2008) reiterates this obser-
vation when he too points out how the literature on global value chains and pro-
duction networks remains quiet on `questions of labour organization and
resistance' (2008: 217; see also Carswell and De Neve, 2013). Studies that focus
on single firms, inter-firm networks and conversations concerning management-led
upgrading of production are perennially engrossed with issues of governance from
above, leaving out crucial analysis of `workshop-based labour politics within global
commodity chains' (De Neve, 2008: 217). Labour politics then largely tends to be
hidden from view in analysing geographies of global production systems.
Yet for others, global union campaigns, international framework agreements
and transnational solidarity campaigns are considered to be a potential panacea for
challenging the worst excesses of global capital (Bronfenbrenner, 2007; Merk,
2009). Corporate codes of conduct are used as a rallying point by consumer pres-
sure groups and global campaigns to bolster support for workers under duress.
Nevertheless, as Gunawardana (2007) shows, even where local management,
because of global pressures, eventually recognizes unionization, its resilience is
questionable when the global forces peter out. She draws out the various pressure
points in global-local initiatives towards union recognition at Jaqalanka Apparels.
While Jaqalanka's location within Katanayake's Free Trade Zone was initially a
boon to its workers, enabling them to access numerous labour rights organizations
and unions across borders, once the global campaign diverted attention elsewhere,
union gains were eventually scattered. She thus highlights the limitations of factory-
by-factory and single campaign unionization efforts (Gunawardana, 2011). Equally,
despite evidence of labour resistance and spontaneous strike action in a prominent
industrial park in Kerala, Padmanabahn's (2012) research also suggests how work-
ers shun political identification and avoid labelling their collective will as a union.
Their ambivalence about conventional union politics surfaces from ignorance
around industrial relations and experiences of not getting direct political support
from elsewhere (2012: 985). Assertions of labour agency and resistance, hence, result
in various beneficiary concessions around strike actions, but also raise the spectre of
de-politicization and worker cynicism around union politics (2012: 986).
The flip side of this worker cynicism is the role of management in taming or
controlling labour. Masculine corporate culture fusing together with localized cul-
tures of paternalism become mechanisms through which workplace control is
exerted, which results in workers resorting to hysterical verbal attacks and
120 Ethnography 16(1)
absenteeism, for instance, to mark their resistance in alternative ways (Elias, 2005).
Yet she suggests that the danger of focusing only on culturally specific forms of
resistance is to miss the `nascent class or gender consciousness embodied in these
acts' (2005: 217). Using the Tiruppur garment cluster in South India, De Neve
(2008) traces the ways in which workers lose interest in unions because of how
employers cultivate `relationships of dependency and patronage', which effectively
silence workers' voices (2008: 222). He hence calls for research that historicizes and
embeds labour struggles within a located and contextual political economy.
These scholarly interventions suggest that understanding how labour responds
to the expansion of capital through global spaces helps uncover the differentiated
geographies of capitalism, which facilitates the need to carve out a space for a
labour geography (Herod, 2001; Castree, 2007). Through a focus on the voice of
labour, labour geography focuses on working-class activities, their spatial embed-
ding and how this enables or constrains social praxis. How workers try to influence
and shape geographical relationships and structures within global capitalism is a
core concern of labour geography ­ or `how labour must respond' to the new
political economy of capitalism (Herod, 2001: 131).
Sri Lankan labour draws upon gains made by a historically strong labour move-
ment extending to the immediate pre-independence years that resulted in numerous
labour laws aiming to protect the rights of labour (Jayawardena, 1972). The
strength of the Sri Lankan labour movement manifested itself in the form of left
political parties and trade unions and has asserted their autonomy with varying
levels of success (Jayawardena, 1974; Candland, 2002). The state responded, offer-
ing the legislative and regulatory space for collective labour to aver its rights and a
constitutional right for citizens to freely associate; employers therefore had to
contend with national level unions across various sectors (Jayawardena, 1974).
Post-liberalization Sri Lanka, circa 1977 onwards, however, has resulted in a
weakening space for union politics because the attention of the state has shifted
from labour to capital (Gunawardana and Biyanwila, 2008; Hensman, 2011).
National level unions exist in the apparel sector; they are constantly trying to
reclaim lost ground and against the odds have made valuable a presence in the
free trade zones (Women's Centre, 2006). Still, unions are culpable of not organiz-
ing around the interests and rights of women workers in a post-liberalized Sri
Lanka; illuminating the contradictory nature of labour struggles (Gunawardana,
2011). Garment sector labour in post-liberalized Sri Lanka has faced moments of
success that are worth celebrating (Women's Centre, 2006). Yet, union activity is
also marked by chequered trajectory; because by leaving out the gendered, cultural
and spatial nuances of labouring lives, unions risk the ability to sustain effective
labour mobilization temporally (Gunawardana, 2011). This historical trajectory
helps us to appreciate the current position of labour politics in Sri Lankan society
because it brings to the fore labour voices on union politics, with my research
suggesting that it is multiple and paradoxical.
It is, however, not only labour which gains from Sri Lanka's strong statutory
frameworks; apparel producers too draw upon Sri Lanka's strong labour
Ruwanpura 121
legislation, durable socio-development record and its educated labour force to
make its ethical positioning possible (Ruwanpura and Wrigley, 2011). The state
then has been a principal arbiter of industrial relations (Castree, 2007: 859), bene-
fiting capital and labour at different epochs in Sri Lanka's industrial development
path. These facets are coupled together with an industrial mindset that sees itself as
being in the vanguard of upgrading by setting up globally superior production
facilities (Karp, 1999; Knutsen, 2004; O'Leary, 2009). The critical import of trade-
labour standards in the post-Multi-Fibre Agreement (MFA) milieu coupled together
with its ability to produce quality garments underlie the industry's ability to shift to
value-added `ethical' production (Gunawardana, 2007). The industry has much to
boast about, making Sri Lanka's ethical position on the global garment production
map one with a discernible basis ­ but it also borrows on past state-led social devel-
opment and historical gains by the labour movement. And it also remains the case
that ethical codes governing the global industry are applied unevenly and grey areas
abound for the Sri Lankan apparel sector (Ruwanpura, 2012), with much paucity in
the realm of freedom of association (see also Anner, 2012).
This article traces how workers attempted to achieve unionization, spontan-
eously and locally, without local-global connections of global solidarity campaigns.
While the efforts of these workers floundered, there is much to learn from the
multi-faceted responses of management to unionization efforts ­ which are not
always a linear rejoinder. Worker harassment is a common tactic and it came to
be used at this factory setting too (Gunawardana, 2007; Hensman, 2011). Similar
to observations made by De Neve (2008) and Elias (2005), managers gained labour
obedience through calls to loyalty and steadfastness but also by invoking the eco-
nomic insecurity that pervades labourers' everyday lives. The eventual faltering of
an embryonic union was an outcome of the constrained space within which labour
agency tends to be articulated, but a space that needs nuanced analysis to be
satisfactorily incorporated into labour geography.
Labour geographers have already noted how `capital needs to work place if it is
to be successful: it must work to embed itself locally so as to develop the economic
relationships with local labour forces' (Herod, 2012: 19; see also Cumbers et al.,
2008; Castree, 2007). My findings illustrate that this working of place can sometimes
act against the collective interests of labour. Where the immediate material interests
of segments of workers coincides with employer strategies and because labour itself
is a `site of on-going class struggle', Cumbers et al. (2008) have already shown how
the working out of multiple positions within labour results in complex and divisive
consequences across uneven development spaces (2008: 373). These tensions, how-
ever, I contend need not merely arise across distinct uneven spaces; the accent of
my findings is on labour tensions within the same space. Worker ambivalence
towards unions and a lack of sustained global networking opportunities also
thwarted labour efforts at unionization (Ost, 2005; Gunawardana, 2007;
Padmanabhan, 2012).1 Anxieties around unionization and union politics by work-
ers need to be registered if we are to be attentive to labour geographies in their
complexity and heterogeneity.
122 Ethnography 16(1)
Often research has tended to hone in on union and solidarity campaigns that are
effective and successful and yield beneficial outcomes to labour (Merk, 2009;
Miller, 2012), whilst the paradoxical nature of labour attitudes towards union
politics are left unanalysed (Padmanabhan, 2012). Consequently, we know little
of why worker efforts at associating freely wither: this raises the important ques-
tion, is there nothing to be learnt from failed episodes and constrained spaces
within which labour activism enlivens and shrivels (for exceptions see De Neve,
2008)? Tracing how workers attempt initiating unionization and the subsequent
management responses suggests complex global-local dynamics at play; it also
proposes that global governance regimes operate locally in a socio-cultural con-
text, where place-based local identities and tropes are constantly invoked and
deployed (De Neve, 2012; Carswell and De Neve, 2013). Appreciating the possi-
bilities of and limitations faced by labour activism hence requires us to tease out
the local, through which we can understand the tensions around global govern-
ance regimes and value the ways in which labour responds to globalization.
Anthropologists and geographers alike emphasize the importance of social rela-
tions and appreciating the cultural environment for analysing labour agency
within global production (Castree, 2007; De Neve, 2012; Carswell and De
Neve, 2013). Their focus is on the everyday forms of agency in the realms of
livelihoods and social reproduction. In contrast, using workplace ethnography,
my article delineates the minutiae around worker commitment and ambivalences
to union politics within a production site. The sections below narrate the field-
work undertaken; using narrative ethnography, it details an episode surrounding
spontaneous strike action, consequent efforts at worker unionization and man-
agement responses to it.
Field research: Within and across borders
The fieldwork for this research was carried out over a two-year period. The incipi-
ent stages of the research involved undertaking interviews with 25 senior and mid-
ranking managers from buying offices over a two-month period (Ruwanpura and
Wrigley, 2011). A successful round of meetings with management led to an oppor-
tune climate of openness, fostered by two managers in particular, with them gen-
erously admitting the PI and RA to be based at a couple of factories over a longer
period (Ruwanpura, 2012).
The two factories sites were based in the interior of Kalutara district, which was
semi-rural, and were based outside of any factory zones. They produced for the UK
and the US market primarily and made lingerie and outwear for high street brands
like Marks and Spencer, Debenhams, BHS, Tesco, American Eagle, and George, as
well as for more exclusive retailers, such as Eddie Bauer, Calvin Klein, Tommy
Hilfiger, Levi Strauss and Lily Pulitzer. Regular auditing by local commercial
companies engaged by the Ethical Trade Initiative (ETI), Fair Labour
Association (FLA), WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Apparel Production) or indi-
vidual retailer commissioned auditors was the norm.
Ruwanpura 123
The factory at the centre of my analysis employed approximately 800 workers,
which is a large production facility for the Sri Lankan apparel sector. Like many
high-end producers, it was a member of the GWG programme and flaunted itself as
possessing impeccable conditions of work. With a purpose built factory con-
structed to high building regulation standards, it produced exclusively for a UK
high street retailer who was a member of the ETI (Ethical Trading Initiative).
Hence the factory was subject to ETI-mandated annual audit and I was told it
had never encountered insurmountable problems; likewise, during my time there
managers used ethical codes as a point of reference and mentioned how it shaped
relations with workers. While the majority of machine operators on the factory
floor were labouring women, approximately 15 per cent of operators were men ­
partly reflecting the increasing challenges employers face in recruiting and retaining
exclusively women workers. Even as employers were responding to labour chal-
lenges by having to diversify their recruitment strategies, this particular factory had
a classic gender division of labour: its senior, middle and low management (super-
visory) positions were predominantly held by men (approximately 95%).
Between early August 2009 and the end of February 2010 I undertook local
ethnographic fieldwork, with daily visits to the two factories to become acquainted
with the workers. During this entire period, I was also boarded at a nearby local
home so that I got to know workers both on and off-site. Subsequent to this
extended fieldwork period, there were return fieldtrips of two to three months
duration until June 2011. Dialogue with workers in the interim period and when
I was back in the UK was done via monthly telephone conversations with groups
of workers.
Wasana, a Research Assistant, present at the two factories, supplemented the
fieldwork. She had started her fieldwork from April 2009 to create a favourable
context for developing worker familiarity and sustained a rapport throughout the
two-year period ­ even in my absence from the field locations. The presence of the
RA also ensured that a select group of workers maintained worker dairies over a
one-year period with their experiences of ethical code practices.
Elsewhere I have noted how our age groups, ability to speak in the local lan-
guage and constant presence enabled us to develop an excellent rapport with work-
ers and build long lasting connections (Ruwanpura, 2013a, 2014). There I also
noted how all constituencies were aware of the politics embedded in our class
positioning and the myriad power factors that needed to be negotiated sensitively.
Instead of rehearsing these points, here I make a pitch for how crucial those tele-
phone call connections turned out to be in gathering data for this particular episode
and code violation.
My decision when I returned to the UK to sustain the rapport built up with
workers whilst in Sri Lanka was motivated by several factors. At the end of the
extended field period, it was evident that there were workers that I had built very
good connections with, which my RA did not necessarily have; she had grown
familiar with other workers in certain instances. The importance of investing in
these personal connections was evident for the long-term viability of the research.
124 Ethnography 16(1)
Equally importantly, however, a bond had developed between segments of workers
and me, which I did not feel comfortable jeopardizing. Because of our different
class positioning and my exposure across various scales of class, privilege and
international connections, there was a certain implicit trust placed on me to recip-
rocate their openness to make my research possible.
My decision to maintain relations with workers was vindicated by events four
months after my return to the UK. When an incident involving an assault against a
worker took place towards the end of June 2010, there were ring cuts ­ which is
when someone from the factory gives a ring and it serves as a code for me to return
the call ­ and text messages requesting that I get in touch with them urgently. It was
the same for the RA where she too was given ring cuts and text messages, with
some information coming to us at real-time. The initial trigger for me, however,
was an urgent email by my RA detailing the assault and the ongoing work
stoppage.
Information at the early stages of the incident was then gathered via emails and
Skype calls with the RA and extended telephone conversations with workers
and middle managers. This preliminary information was supplemented when I
met and interviewed workers and the assaulted young man on a return fieldtrip.
My ability to pick up on the incident and revisit it ­ albeit by recollection for
workers by then ­ was because of the central significance of telephone connections
with workers within and across borders. Research, when it extends beyond a tightly
framed located period, required using modern technology in its infinite possibilities
to sustain field research across global scales.
The next section discusses the factory setting, which paves the way for detailing
the episode that led to workers spontaneously rising and helps appreciate how,
ultimately, worker agitation and efforts at union formation were more than likely
to dissipate. The dynamics that resulted from and after the assault also suggest how
factories based in rural communities are connected globally in a selective fashion: a
global-local (mis)connection that frustrated union sustenance in the factory setting.
It illustrates how global governance regimes are about labour politics as well as
ethical codes; thus, to assume collective labour rights would be enhanced or upheld
via the circulation of voluntary codes is a parochial understanding of labour geo-
graphies (McIntyre, 2008). As my article shows, the ways in which management
and labour make place have even more important bearing on whether ethical codes,
particularly around workers' rights to unionize, will be upheld or displaced.
Ipso facto loquax
During my initial days of fieldwork in the factory setting, a senior level manager
inquired about my first impressions of the production site. I responded honestly,
saying that work conditions seemed inspiring and the work force appeared relaxed,
motivated and genuinely appreciative of their workplace. He responded by saying
`ipso facto loquax' and translated this to mean that the facts speak for themselves.
In many ways, he was not far off from the truth in making this statement. The built
Ruwanpura 125
space of the factory was excellent and maintained physical conditions similar to
factories at the high-end of supply chain within Sri Lanka, some of which set global
standards (Karp, 1999; O'Leary, 2009). Moreover, during my fieldwork that
included participant-observation and in-depth formal interviews with 30 workers
from this factory, the general consensus regarding floor-level practices was one of
praise. However, floor managers and supervisors did pressurize line workers to
meet targets set, which workers grumbled were increasingly unrealistic. Yet the
ways in which they encouraged meeting these targets was through cajoling, flattery
and gentle invectives rather than through harsh words, abuse or violence towards
the workers. It made workers, especially those with experience at other factory
settings, appreciate the labour-friendly approach to work floor practices. Floor
practices in this factory were in contrast to the norm where constant scolding
and verbal abuse comes with the job (Gunawardana, 2007).
Anthropologists have pointed out that these management techniques do, how-
ever, carry with them a paternalism and politics of feudal hierarchy conducive to
exhorting workers to meet the demands of capitalist production (De Neve, 2001,
2008). Management-worker relationships in such situations sustain a fine balancing
act, as these self-same feudal hierarchies can unleash unexpected brutality when and
where authority is challenged or obviously destabilized (Burawoy, 1983). Quite sud-
denly this is precisely what occurred in this factory towards the end of June 2010. The
next section summarizes the incident that led to efforts at unionization by workers
and the subsequent thwarting and eventual disbanding of the union. The narration
offers a platform through which to unpick how the Sri Lankan apparel industry
positioned itself as an ethically sourcing destination while its track record of safe-
guarding the collective rights of labour remains, at best, unreliable.
From individual violence to collective responses
Wasana, the RA, informed me via email at the end of June 2010 of an assault upon
a young worker, a man, which occurred during the night shift. Many workers took
the initiative to call her to register their annoyance, disquiet, shock or dread with
unfolding events, and she in turn sent me excessive and lengthy emails on the
information coming through. Ten workers with whom I made contact on the
day and over the next 10 to 14 day period then corroborated the episode. I also
had telephone conversations, more than once, with three middle level managers
with whom I had established affinity during my fieldwork. All these phone con-
versations lasted anything between 30 and 60 minutes on average. Wasana also
interviewed the security officers involved in the episode. Subsequently, on a return
field visit, I met with and interviewed the young man at the centre of the uproar
(who will be called Jeevan), meeting him on two occasions. Prior to my interviews
with Jeevan, immediately after the incident Wasana got in touch, as she knew him
from her field visits. By interviewing various constituents, I made every effort at
triangulating the emerging storylines with events noted below, trying to modestly
capture the core narrative.
126 Ethnography 16(1)
It was around 3.00­3.30 am on the night shift when workers became aware of
the Human Resource (HR) Manager walking around the production floor. A delay
caused to a labour recruitment trip by the HR office to the North Central province
resulted in an unexpected visit around the factory floor by the HR Manager. When
visiting the cutting section, he had found the men using and chatting freely on their
mobiles, which irritated him; as a result he castigated the security guards for letting
workers carry mobile phones onto the floor. The security personnel responded by
remarking that the workers were increasingly insubordinate and used a recent
incident to illustrate their observations.
Being the month of June, heavy northwestern monsoonal rains typified the days
for workers coming into work, and an overtime shift on Sunday was no different.
Jeevan was accompanied by his fiance
´ , a co-worker, on his motorbike and parked
his bike in the shed usually kept for managers. When he disembarked, the area
security officer had said that he could not park his vehicle in that location, which
resulted in an altercation with Jeevan, who had remarked that the heavy rains and
absence of managers on a Sunday made this prudent. He had initially defied the
security officer's diktats and gone into the shop floor, although later ­ when the
rains ceased ­ he had removed his bike from the shed on the advice of the Officer-
in-Charge (OIC) of Security.
This incident led to a trigger of procedural events. The OIC reported the inci-
dent to HR at the start of the week, as is the norm. The junior HR staff had
recorded the security officer's version of events, and since Jeevan was on the
night shift that week they had made a request to his line supervisor that Jeevan
meet with HR before he clocked on. Because the HR office was making arrange-
ments for a recruitment trip, they had left the office early on Monday evening and
had briefly registered Jeevan's version, requesting that all parties meet on
Wednesday or Thursday.
The security officer's narration of events to the HR manager resulted in an
agitated confrontation between Jeevan and the manager with the manager seeking
and violently attempting to throw the worker out of production. Jeevan refused to
be intimidated, retorting that the manager has no basis to dismiss him from the
production line. The HR manager then forcefully dragged Jeevan out of the shop
floor. Outside of the production floor, a brawl broke out between Jeevan, the HR
managers and the security officers ­ and this made workers walk out, initially to
protect a co-worker2 and then to make a collective stand against the violence they
had witnessed.
Workers started walking out when they saw that Jeevan was bleeding, and they
were suspicious and disdainful of management's offer to take him to hospital.
Workers, therefore, took charge of supporting Jeevan's hospitalization arrange-
ments and insisted that the HR manager be sent into police custody and dismissed
immediately for initiating violence. When other managers ­ all called urgently in
the early hours of morning ­ realized that their power was being usurped and
that the crowd of workers were beyond control, they sought police assistance.3
Because the local police station did not have the capacity to manage the potentially
Ruwanpura 127
violent uproar, a battalion of 400 police officers came together from three nearby
stations. During this time, the management team also got the assistance of the
police to bundle the HR manager out of the factory premises and, given worker
demands, took him to the local police station. The worker stridency only came to a
halt after a select group of workers travelled to the police station and witnessed
that the HR manager had been remanded.4
Collective upheaval and beyond: Delicate strategizing towards
unionization?
While this uproar was taking place, the more strategically minded labourers, con-
sisting of an older woman worker and a couple of younger workers (a man and
woman, respectively), started speaking with the adjoining factory, which was
unionized, on the mechanics of union formation. They, together with a mixed
age group of women workers and younger working men, rationalized that since
they were unionized, management would not subject them to unexpected intimi-
dation. They thought in a unionized factory setting the kind of episode they had
witnessed would not have taken place, and this incident was repeatedly mentioned
by workers as instrumental in forging the strength of the union. Contrary to
Padmanabhan's (2012) observation that workers in her research site were `unaware
of seemingly simple information', in this factory milieu a segment of workers
became proactive about their possibilities for union formation.
Spare membership forms obtained from the adjacent factory were passed
around urging workers to join the union. However, there were insufficient forms
to get the 40 per cent of worker membership on the day, which is the minimum
required for the management to formally recognize and negotiate with the union.
Nonetheless, a union was formed with a membership committee of mostly women
workers holding key committee positions;5 by 11.00am management was informed
regarding the formation of the union via a formal letter. Initially management was
non-committal and after lunch made a decision to close the factory until the next
working day; day and night shifts were cancelled and workers were discharged, at
which point workers left the premises.
Workers involved in forming the union said that events facilitated good recruit-
ment, with no great need to coax workers to join. They regretted not possessing a
greater number of membership forms, because they were convinced that they
would have then recruited the required number of workers. Workers who did
not join the union said that they felt all of them were agitated and hence it was
hardly a day to join without reflection, while others were ambivalent because of the
fear of its implications for factory operations ­ and hence their jobs. Answering the
roll call to join the union was greatly affected by considerations of protecting job
and income security. These fears and insecurities were conveyed to us by a number
of workers during and in the immediate aftermath of the incident, as well as during
personal conversations on a return fieldtrip months after the event. Management
played on worker anxieties in the next few days in frustrating the shaping of a
128 Ethnography 16(1)
unionized workforce, although not all managers were unanimous in the ways in
which union politics was thwarted.
Politics of fear and insecurity
Management reactions to the newly formed union were varied and tended to
appear random and unplanned; yet three distinct strands could be discerned in
force regarding how the newly formed unions were received. The first view was that
without a 40 per cent membership of the labouring body, the management were
under no legal obligation to recognize any union. Another set of managers more
refreshingly opined that union presence in and of itself need not hamper cordial
management-labour relations. The third perspective, which eventually prevailed,
was that the incipient union organizational activities had to be split.
It is worthwhile illustrating these positions in some depth, even though the dom-
inant view eventually ensured that the union activities were discouraged and even-
tually disbanded. I do so because, unlike De Neve (2008: 234­5), I want to suggest
that the formation of a doxa or a reified neo-liberal position is multifarious with
possible spaces for labour struggles to manoeuvre and make their voices heard ­
however inaudible they may be in the global landscape (see also Herod, 2001: 17).
One view within management staff was that as long as the union did not have 40
per cent membership, they were under no legal compulsion to recognize the newly
formed union or its incipient activities. Reflecting a recent Supreme Court judge-
ment that attempted to thwart unionization activities and goes against the spirit of
the ILO core conventions, these managers contended that it was best to not try to
break up the efforts of workers to harness union activities. Managers of this per-
suasion were also aware that any active effort to hinder workers' right to freely
associate would undermine the ethical codes that the factory was governed by. This
perspective was conveyed to the senior director, but fell on deaf ears. Global gov-
ernance regimes may increase management awareness of all aspect of labour rights,
with even potential sympathies for upholding these from some quarters. There is,
however, no inevitability that all rights will be upheld because of an absence of will
from the entire management (Miller, 2012). The reification of neo-liberal govern-
ance regimes and the internalization of them by management is a patchy process
when the multiple perspectives management views are registered.
Another view was that unionization need not necessarily lead to the impairment
of factory and production activities. It was not simply managers who expressed this
view to me, but also workers who said that they felt sufficiently comfortable and
confident to approach certain managers and discuss with them the ways in which
union activities could be worked out at the factory setting. This group often alluded
to the adjacent unionized factory where they highlighted that both management
and workers understood the need to work together. They pointed out that it was
not necessarily and always the case that workers resorted to strike action and that
often joint decision-making can lead to outcomes that take better consideration
of labour interests. Both these perspectives, however, unfortunately turned out to
Ruwanpura 129
be insignificant. The view that prevailed, with tacit endorsement by the Principal
Director, was that the union had to be split before it gained further strength and
momentum. Towards this end a senior manager together with some of his floor
level managers commenced a series of direct and indirect offensives that would
ensure that the burgeoning union politics would scatter.
The dominant vision was bolstered through a two-pronged process. One strat-
egy deployed cultural norms and discourses of family in a consistent fashion to
both instil a politics of fear and loyalty ­ invoking the coercive face of paternalist
management regimes (Burawoy, 1983: 599; De Neve, 2001; Elias, 2005;
Gunawardana, 2007). The other stratagem was a textbook illustration of `bad
practice'. On the floor level, workers who joined the union and especially union
committee members tended to be singled out and subjected to various forms of
harassment, including being taunted about their lack of loyalty towards a factory
that offered them employment (Elias, 2005; Gunawardana, 2007). In the sections to
follow, I use ethnographic vignettes to illustrate these broader points. By tracing
these processes, it is possible to highlight the specific local forms of anti-union
politics that need airplay, since as Anner (2012) notes, existing quantitative analysis
signals continuing fault-lines in labour relations but does not enable firm conclu-
sions (2012: 612). Management's ability to act with impunity in this sphere is due to
the global landscape within which the apparel sector operates (Anner, 2012;
McIntyre, 2008). Lack of code convergence, its presumed universal applicability
and packaging it as an ahistorical and apolitical instrument all feed into taking the
politics out of a code pertaining to collective labour rights (De Neve, 2008).
National spaces which constrain or facilitate unionization and labour movements
also play a vital role (Bronfenbrenner, 2007; Cumbers et al., 2008). Although Sri
Lanka has had a strong labour movement historically, which won many conces-
sions from the colonial and post-colonial governments (Jayawardena, 1972, 1974),
it also remains the case that in post-liberalized Sri Lanka union politics has had an
uneven trajectory ­ with many losses and few gains (Gunawardana and Biyanwila,
2008). It is a setting hardly conducive for union formation at a semi-rural local
factory, with non-existent solidarity connections nationally or internationally;
while the desire of labour for unionization existed, its burgeoning was to be tem-
pered because global governance codes filter through the politics, socio-economic
conditions and cultural forces of local spaces.
Against this backdrop, a senior manager took it upon himself to call up groups
of workers, divided into old and new workers, younger and older workers, men and
women workers, unionized and non-unionized workers, after the episode. At each
session, he called upon the workers to show loyalty towards a factory that offers
them employment, pointing to how unionized factories invariably close down as
buyers do not like working with such suppliers! He pointed to the various benefits
that the factory offered the workers from the provision of subsidized transportation
to factory meals. He also invoked the factory's existence over a lengthy period of
time without any blemish to its reputation, a situation that unions apparently
would bring into jeopardy.
130 Ethnography 16(1)
Moreover, he pointed to how management and workers had worked together
cordially in the past and reminded older workers of the prevailing factory ethos,
while letting new workers know about its worker-friendly environment. In this
regard, he evoked how the factory was characterized by a family-like atmosphere,
which worked well, in which management listened to workers' concerns and made
every effort to respond:
We treat each other like brothers and sisters ­ like an extended family who know how
to iron out discord through conversation and discussion, even when things go wrong.
We may get irritated and annoyed, but we know in the end that, like a family, it is in
everyone's interest to work together. The workers who have served here for long
periods know this; we have never had this kind of episode of our existence ­ and
that is testimony to our ethos, of working together like families do. Unions invariably
puncture that filial and affable relationship.
Invoking familiar cultural tropes of kin, family and loyalty to nurture harmo-
nious industrial relations is not unusual in the apparel sector (De Neve, 2001). The
distinction on this occasion was that the manager was actively involved in blurring
an acrimonious worker-management division which had catalyzed the strike action
and collective anger of workers in the past days by reminding workers how the
presence of unions would puncture the otherwise smooth functioning of genial
worker-management relations. Unions were painted as an external intrusion into
the internal operations of the factory. He had also stirred up fear by mentioning
how any worker failing to heed to management requests might cause dire conse-
quences in terms of factory closure, with buyers more than likely to relocate to
countries in the African continent, where labour was cheaper. By not using exam-
ples from neighbouring South Asia, which workers have good awareness of, but
deploying a less known continent, worker ignorance and trepidation was com-
pounded. Using deception, veiled threats and intimidation, labour was expected
to cooperate with capital ­ not to do so would dismantle their own job security and
futures (Elias, 2005).
Different workers who were drafted into the distinct groups told me how the
character of senior managers' communication was nuanced and tailored according
to the group being addressed. For instance, male workers were informed of how, as
men, they should understood how it is easy to get provoked by unjust incidents on
the floor. However, the manager had also emphasized how calm and cool-
headedness was more likely to yield the desired results rather than agitation and
provocation with supervisors, management or peers. Many workers mentioned
that, in retrospect, they became aware what the management was doing was to
separate and divide workers from forging any further alliances. Even so, they
revealed that as they were being constantly called up in segmented groups man-
agers emphasized potential job insecurity and instilled fear. By calling upon the
economic realities and discourses of the family inflected with elements of deceit,
this senior manager was playing on common cultural tropes and the material
Ruwanpura 131
hardship of workers to disseminate a politics of fear and insecurity. Through these
actions he largely succeeded in thwarting the activities and progression of the newly
formed union, with workers becoming mistrustful of each other and seeing the
union as creating uncertainty.
Against this backdrop, floor managers and supervisors were given free rein to
single out and target unionized workers for harassment. While there was no report-
ing of direct assaults by supervisors or floor managers,6 many unionized workers
felt that they were intimidated in subtle and indirect ways. A unionized committee
member said how her floor manager would say, `Shame on you for forming the
union and getting others to join it. We are keeping an eye on those union members.
They are the ones most likely to lose their jobs if they don't meet their productivity
targets'. She said that along with such statements, she and others like her were
given targets higher than those of their peers and noted how her area floor manager
would loiter around her and other union workers. Such practices were found to be
menacing in particular because she said that previously she had a very good rap-
port with her floor manager.
Another unionized worker said that there was a dramatic shift of attitude
towards her and other union workers on the floor:
Now it is not like before. The managers and supervisors are much more draconian in
the way they deal with us in everyday tasks. Because we have always been aware that
we have had good floor practices and a solid affinity with our supervisors and man-
agers, there is a marked difference ­ and we feel it. It is as if the incidents of the day
were our fault and not that of the management!
Even non-unionized workers noted the changes at the factory, with an older
woman saying, `There is a change in atmosphere. The floor managers don't trust
the workers anymore; workers don't trust each other. The closeness (suhadhatha-
vaya) that used to prevail is non-existent now.' Deep-seated mistrust and fear
regarding the stability and future of factory operations was instilled amongst work-
ers, showing how everyday workplace practices shed a light on how `localised social
power relations and inequalities' create the real labour practices (Elias, 2005: 206).
Consequently, in this situation the space for union politics was easily usurped; with
a global governance code getting pushed aside.
Another worker told me that the managers and supervisors were particularly
watchful of men workers embroiled in the incident and who later unionized. While
there were no immediate blatant reprisals against these workers, she pointed out
how Jeevan had left the factory by about October 2010 with a cloud hanging over
the reasons for his departure ­ with rumours of him getting paid off to do so. She
said that management was hounding union workers or forcing them to retract
from their union membership and then asking forgiveness from the management.
Indeed two of the workers who had informed me of their fear and yet determined
to remain in the union subsequently had resigned from the union with one of
them noting,
132 Ethnography 16(1)
Aiyo, we also made a decision to leave the union because the management was suc-
cessful in making us fearful and getting union workers to rescind their membership ­
by asking forgiveness from Mr. L. There was very few from the original list of union
members left in the weeks and months after. We also went on our knees, worshipped
him, asked forgiveness for forming the union and removed our names from the mem-
bership list. I worshipped both Mr. L and Mr. D ­ my floor manager ­ and got their
forgiveness.
The other worker didn't offer me this level of detail as to how and why she
rescinded her membership and indeed seemed embarrassed and awkward in talking
about her active involvement in forming the union when we met on a return
fieldtrip.7 Ex-union members felt that resigning from the union and asking for
`forgiveness' was the only way to be graciously treated by management.
The other worker who offered a detailed description of the union formation and
activities on my last fieldtrip to Sri Lanka (December 2010­January 2011) thought:
It is our ill luck that there were not enough application forms to get more workers to
join the union on the day. Afterwards the workers got scared the way in which Mr. L
was calling us in different groups and informing us of the risks of unionization and
falsely letting us know that the factory closure was inevitable if the union was to
remain. Some of the workers took a step back (pita passa gahuwwa) and hesitated;
it is a chance that we missed to represent our interests collectively.
She had not resigned from her union membership, even though she knew that
there was little point in remaining in an inactive union; for her, this decision was
symbolic ­ the assertion of her rights. She also acknowledged that she had a floor
manager sympathetic to union politics and as a worker with experience she did not
undergo the kind of intimidation others went through. She was aware of her rights
and unafraid to assert them, if need be. Undoubtedly she illustrated a laudable
moment of labour agency, but she was in no doubt that the agency that really
matters is that of the collective will of labour (McIntyre, 2008). Stemming nascent
class-consciousness, in her view, was putting a stop on `always the need to organize
to resist' (Elias, 2005: 217).
Throughout the episode and later on my return fieldtrip visit I also spoke with
many other workers who did not join the union and were ambivalent about its role.
The uncertainty recorded by some stemmed from the fears that the management
had instilled in their psyche; but there were also others who were critical of man-
agement tactics but remained unconvinced that a union can necessarily lead to
better working conditions. One worker vehemently disapproved of the way in
which the management went about dealing with workers after the incident,
but she also went onto say `Union presence alone won't resolve our issues.
Where have unions made a difference? Not in Sri Lanka' (see also Ost, 2005; De
Neve, 2008; Padmanabhan, 2012). Her views were at odds with the direct experi-
ence of the neighbouring unionized factory that had no recent reported incidents.
Ruwanpura 133
However, according to village folklore, historically this factory seems to have had
tumultuous industrial relations. Yet neither she nor any other worker made explicit
reference to any particular episode regarding the adjoining unionized factory in
registering her discomfort with unions and union politics.
Others brought up the role of Jeevan in the furore and his role in the aftermath
of the strike. One worker said:
Because of him we got involved in striking against the management and now he is not
even at the factory, because he got paid loads of money to keep him silent and then he
left. In front of us, he even told the manager ­ who had called us and requested that
we drop the union ­ that the HR manager didn't hit him; it was the security he did so.
The case he started with the labour tribunal has been dropped apparently. We are still
languishing: we feel foolish at times for all our efforts to standby each other.
Others had a more sympathetic reading of his inability to remain working at the
factory.8 The view that the existence of a union may not necessarily be a boon to
workers within the factory and its presence may only spoil and create unnecessary
divisions within workers was also a prevalent view. These conversations made it
apparent that the broader setting of unions being vilified in the media and anti-
union sentiment since Sri Lanka's transition to a market-based economy in 1977
was filtering through and colouring the imagination of workers (Women's Centre,
2006). Strands of public cynicism and de-politicization of workers referred to by
Padmanbhan (2012) in this instance were connected to worker perceptions on the
ability of unions to make a difference in their lives. This, coupled with the economic
insecurity blighting their everyday lives, meant that the politics of fear and inse-
curity deliberately propagated by segments of managers made complete sense in the
wider political economy.
The politics of global governance codes
Collective labour struggles and strike action rarely enter the radar screen of aca-
demic debates on global governance (De Neve, 2008; Anner, 2012). Yet freedom of
association and collective bargaining, despite its appearance in the global govern-
ance regimes, is often not sustained in supplier countries. This collective labour
right has an uneven, neglected and sometimes downtrodden record in Western
nations (McIntyre, 2008), and hence its application in the Global South remains
irregular (Gunawardana, 2011; Anner, 2012). Consequently, the violation of this
code does not register with the media, whether in the UK (where the sole buyer of
this factory is based) or in Sri Lanka. Indeed, the entire episode of a serious assault
against a worker leading to worker uprising at a factory magically evaded any
scrutiny ­ save an internal investigation surrounding the violent episode, but not
its deliberative breach of an ethical code related to freedom of association. The
buyers were kept in ignorance, aided by the 5000 odd miles that separate the UK
and Sri Lanka. The UK's own recent union record of tightening labour laws
134 Ethnography 16(1)
contravenes its obligation towards the ILO conventions (Martin et al., 1993), a
backdrop which is likely to influence the extent to which UK-based multi-stake-
holder initiatives give the code serious consideration. Additionally, snap-shot
auditing systems are incapable of capturing significant disruption and violation
of ethical code regime unless by coincidence there was to be an audit the next
day at the factory or worker trust had been forged through time (Hensman,
2005; De Neve, 2008; Anner, 2012). Happenstance made me a researcher on site
with a long-term involvement with the factory workers for a project on the evolu-
tion of ethical codes in Sri Lanka, which by and large evaded the negative spotlight
for serious violations of codes or exploitative worker practices. This facilitated the
chronicling of events described above.
Despite ethical codes having a clause protecting the right to associate and col-
lectively bargain, the dissonance between buyers' merchandizing priorities and
CSR sections aided local management, who were able to circumvent any potential
challenge to their authority and unwelcome glare of publicity regarding the inci-
dents of the day. A few middle-level managers mentioned that the merchandisers of
the buyer were casually told that there had been an incident at the factory. This
communication initially took place between the senior manager and the buyer, as
he wanted to keep the UK office abreast of events ­ but he did not divulge signifi-
cant detail. It was a precautionary measure, in case there was some leak that might
have placed the factory and its management into an awkward position. By giving
its headquarters and the high-street retailer just enough information, but not too
much, damage control was maintained. After this soft-peddling dialogue, it was the
merchandizing teams ­ rather than the HR group and the CSR unit of the high-
street retailer ­ that conversed about a softened version of events. This frustrated
the need to hold any inquiry by the buyers, as the merchandizing units of retailers
are notorious for their disconnection from CSR priorities ­ with retailers more
likely to have a reactive rather than a proactive stance on freedom of association
(Bronfenbrenner, 2007; Miller, 2012). Elias (2005) remarks how standards are
upheld where they facilitate firms to maintain labour control, while for Anner
(2012) any `perceived loss of control over the cost structure and operation of
their supply chains' via unions and collective bargaining are distinctly downplayed
in governance regimes. I go further and contend that managers outwit both buyers
and labour by deftly deploying governance regimes to suit their needs. It is not that
capital always cooperates across borders, but rather that sometimes capitalists
draw tactical veils to guarantee that it does not botch the semblance of global
governance.
It is this backdrop that thwarts any serious discussion of the failure to uphold
freedom of association and collective bargaining in the Global South. Thus, the Sri
Lankan apparel sector is able to talk about and promote the country as an ethically
sourced destination because its record in championing particular aspects of the
ethical code regimes is impressive, while it is at the same time non-compliant
when it comes to freedom of association and collective bargaining ­ and hence
living wages. In this regard, Sri Lanka's `Garments without Guilt' campaign
Ruwanpura 135
operates a selective national labelling system with regards to ethical codes and
indeed even when it comes to international employment standards that Sri
Lanka is a signatory to. The narration of events in this article suggests that
there is much at stake regarding the challenges ahead for unions, campaigning
groups and NGO activists in their efforts at promoting freedom of association
and collective bargaining.
A commitment to the politics of labour geography then requires constant
engagement with local and grounded forces, including the state, NGOs, unions
and other relevant actors, so as to re-politicize the rights of garment workers (De
Neve, 2008). I go further to suggest that this re-politicization may mean recog-
nizing that three decades of neo-liberal policies, such as in the case of Sri Lanka,
may have seeped into the psyche of workers. They are hence distrustful or fearful
of collective action, with their personal politics being fairly individualized (see
also Ost, 2005). Paying attention to the political economy of labour, while at
struggle, suggests a complexity where unionization, however important it may be
for the collective will of labour, requires hard work. Serious labour activism
requires acknowledging the complexity of political and social process at stake
for two reasons (Elias, 2005). Firstly, the evolution of a neo-liberal global polit-
ical economy has meant that notable segments of labour are sceptical or ambiva-
lent about union politics. Secondly, neo-liberal governance regimes utilize and
deploy governance regimes via familiar cultural tropes that make sense to local
management-labour relations, resulting in paternal factory politics mediating
code deployment with uneven consequences for labour. Global governance
regimes, in other words, simply do not transmit across global spaces ahistorically
or apolitically; as it hits the ground, it does so in politically, culturally and
materially specific ways ­ and unpacking these processes is important to recover
and restore a commitment to labour geography that shifts our gaze to the col-
lective will of labour agency.
Monumental challenges
Using workplace ethnography in Sri Lanka, this article details the interactions of
management and labour during a labour struggle over union formation. Academic
debates on union politics in the Global South have tended to focus on effective
union and solidarity campaigns, but this article reveals that labour struggles do not
always yield beneficial outcomes for workers. Three decades of neo-liberal policies
in Sri Lanka suggest complexities that labour rights advocates would potentially
prefer to shy away from. Following a violent incident on the shop floor, workers
attempted to develop a union presence. However, once management initiated their
fear-mongering tactics, contact between the neighbouring factory union and the
newly formed union rapidly ceased, partly reasoned by a segment of workers being
sceptical about union politics. This suggests a monumental challenge for unions
attempting to mobilize cynical workers around the benefits of freedom of associ-
ation and collective bargaining. Upholding collective labour rights is highly
136 Ethnography 16(1)
problematic when retrograde management attitudes, material deprivation and lack
of alternative employment opportunities are brought together with palpable fear of
unions and union politics.
For labour geographers, my research unravels thorny situations and processes
that do not offer easy answers and puncture comfort zones on possibilities of
unionizing workers. Effective union formation is not simply contingent upon
varied national spaces (Herod, 2001; Castree, 2007; Cumbers et al., 2008;
Herod, 2012), but also should heed multiple labour anxieties and paternalistic
management tactics on the shop floor. While labour geographers are willing to
concede that there are `significant forces pushing in the direction of individual-
ization', they are less willing to concede that `collective organizations either does
not work or has been radically altered' (Rainnie et al., 2011: 166). This article
signals not simply the increasing individualization of workers, but how we need
to explicitly acknowledge and understand the reasons why unionization is a
fraught process for labour; otherwise, we fail the very constituency, labour,
that labour geographers are committed to centring in debates around global
production (Rainnie et al., 2011). Since substantial sections of labour remain
distrustful of unions or are made to fear its relevance to their working lives, a
labour geography committed to labour politics ought to register worker disquiet
to appreciate the challenges of unionizing workers. Broader global processes of
capital accumulation and uneven development thus lead to contested socio-spatial
relations, resulting in labour occupying compromised and contentious subject
positions (Elias, 2005; De Neve, 2008, 2012). These intricate social relationships
make us aware that universal efforts at union formation will need to heed to
spatial, temporal and place dynamics of labour politics if collective labour rights
are to be championed, protected and sustained.
De Neve (2001) already notes how within the global garment industry neo-
liberal priorities sit together with semi-feudal production floor dynamics for the
gain of capital. Likewise, this article shows how global governance regimes are also
inflected by and implicated in a socio-cultural and political economy context where
paternal and semi-feudal social hierarchies shape the deployment of these global
governance regimes at production sites ­ including that pertaining to freedom of
association and collective bargaining. This situation is aided and reinforced glo-
bally by the geographical dispersion of the supply chain and partiality of emphasis
on labour standards over labour rights (Anner, 2012), with the complicity of the
state in this realm equally needing further scrutiny (see also Hughes, 2007).
Connections made with workers during localized ethnographic research enabled
me to gather information on an episode that is unlikely to have been recorded
otherwise. Undeniably, the value of situated ethnography is that it also offers the
fortuitous chance of challenging `top-down' narratives around global governance
with a level of meticulousness and attention to detail that even I, as a researcher,
would have been unable to envisage at the start of my research. By registering these
events my purpose is to emphasize that Sri Lanka's otherwise admirable ethical
trading record is perforated and patchy ­ with the state and employers being
Ruwanpura 137
equally culpable. Since management exploits worker anxieties in insalubrious ways
and the state is still upholding a constitutionally enshrined right, to presume that
global governance regimes alone have the capacity to mobilize and respect the
collective will of labour remains spurious. While freedom of association, unioniza-
tion and collective bargaining are critical cornerstones for respecting labour rights,
we also need to realistically traverse this path by exploring alliances with NGOs
and social movements to facilitate organizing labour's right to freely associate. The
silent state has to be stirred and management held accountable for its continued
lapses in upholding labour rights. Otherwise, the arena of union formation and
collective bargaining is likely to be an elusive goal for labour from which global
capitalism continues to profit.

Notes
1. However, Hughes (2007) makes arresting observations on how transnational networks
can work against the spontaneous and collective will of labour by giving primacy to
regulated, technocratic and individualized expressions of labour rights (2007: 840).
2. Here slightly conflicting accounts were given. Managers said that the security officers at
this point started hitting Jeevan for getting hold of the HR manager's collar, while the
workers, security and Jeevan said that the HR manager initially hit Jeevan, which for the
security officers was a carte blanche for them to do the same.
3. It is at moments like these that the confluence between the state and capital starkly
manifests itself, with the state willingly deploying violence against protesting workers ­
whether it be in Cambodia (Hughes, 2007) or Sri Lanka (Ruwanpura, 2013b).
4. In the interest of space, an abbreviated account is offered as the bulk of the article focuses
on worker unionization efforts.
5. While there were men in the committee, the union was headed by a woman, as were the
posts of secretary and treasurer; these women were of various age groups.
6. This was, however, to be for the moment. On my return fieldtrip visit between end the end
of November 2010 and the end of January 2011, some of the men workers who were
involved in taking a lead and were boisterous during the strike had been `under watch'
and were put on unpaid leave, with one young man being summarily dismissed for being
a trouble-maker.
7. She was in regular contact with me after the episode and they had unionized to talk to me
about the harassment they were undergoing.
8. The narrative of Jeevan's afterlife from the factory and how he felt compelled to leave
and indeed the extent to which he `profited' from the incident is a topic covered elsewhere
(Ruwanpura, 2012).
