Abstract
This study on news coverage of highly visible company types in a Dutch daily quality
newspaper (NRC Handelsblad; N
=
14,363), during the economic crisis (2007­2013),
shows that attention to banks (and to a lesser extent also to the automobile and
components industry) had a structural negative influence on media agenda diversity. The
majority of the other salient company types had a significant positive impact on diversity.
These results suggest that banks attracted attention at the expense of more varied,
diverse coverage during the crisis. Our findings extend knowledge of agenda-building

media agenda. We discuss our findings in light of causes and consequences of media
coverage of salient businesses.

Over the last years, a number of scholars used the `classical' idea of agenda setting,
which refers to the transfer of issue salience from the media to the public (McCombs,
2004), to study effects of news about organizations. These scholars examined how media
attention to organizations and related attributes can affect the public and other agendas,
mainly in terms of organizational reputation (e.g. Carroll and McCombs, 2003; Meijer
and Kleinnijenhuis, 2006). Others have used the broader concept of `agenda building', or
`media agenda setting' (Denham, 2010), to study how media select and emphasize some
organizations and/or issues over others, thereby mainly focusing on the impact of public
relations on the news (e.g. Kim et al., 2015; Kiousis et al., 2007; Moon and Hyun, 2014;
Ragas et al., 2011). A particular relevant research avenue that remains unexplored by
these `agenda scholars' interested in organizations is that of media agenda diversity.
Research in other areas, mainly political communication and policy studies, has
examined agenda diversity in the agenda-setting process in depth (Kleinnijenhuis et al.,
2015). Zhu (1992) referred to agenda setting as being a `zero-sum game', which means
that attention to one agenda object must go at the expense of others, because the `carry-
ing capacity' of agendas is inherently limited (Hilgartner and Bosk, 1988). In effect,
agenda formation is characterized by intense competition among agenda objects (e.g.
issues or actors), which affects agenda setting (McCombs and Zhu, 1995). Remarkably,
few studies have focused explicitly on the underlying dynamics of `media agenda diver-
sity' and how they can be explained. This refers to the way in which agenda building
influences the diversity structure of the media agenda, or, in other words, how the jour-
nalistic shaping of the agenda in terms of attention to specific objects may influence the
diversity pattern of the media agenda.
Seeking to inform the literature on agenda building and agenda diversity, particularly
in relation to organizational news, this study investigates the long-term influence of
attention to corporations on media agenda diversity during the economic crisis.
Relating to normative ideas about the function of journalism in society, there is a
wide consensus that journalists should aim to build and maintain a diverse media
agenda. Ideally, a diverse agenda is desirable because it offers comparable opportunities
for social actors (in our case companies, critics, and others) to gain media attention. Yet,
building a diverse agenda may be challenged in times of crisis. Organizational news is
often related to crisis situations, as crises render organizations newsworthy
(Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2013). The so-called `trigger events' (Dearing and Rogers, 1996)
typically catapult crises on the media agenda, causing focused attention waves in the
Jonkman et al. 3
news (Nisbet and Huge, 2006). These waves may then lead to a temporal decline of
agenda diversity since focused attention to crisis-related objects (e.g. certain corpora-
tions) pushes other objects (e.g. other corporations) off the agenda (Kleinnijenhuis
et al., 2015). However, day-to-day patterns of fluctuating agenda diversity are common
in news reporting (Boydstun, 2013). But severe crisis situations, such as global eco-
nomic crises, may affect agenda diversity negatively on a structural level because these
events are capable of sustaining high attention over longer periods of time. The critical
question with regard to diversity then becomes to what extent long-term attention influ-
ences agenda diversity on a structural level?
This study aims to shed light on that question by taking the recent economic crisis as
a case in order to examine to what extent long-term media agenda diversity operates in
the context of attention to a variety of media salient company types (e.g. transport com-
panies, banks, energy firms), in Dutch economic news between 2007 and 2013. Hereby,
focus is on the effect of media attention to banks since they have been objects of fierce
discussion in news coverage during and after the financial crisis in 2007. In the economic
crisis that hit Europe years after that period, banks have been central actors and they have
undergone several large waves of attention. This makes them especially relevant to con-
sider in the context of agenda diversity since attention patterns for these organizations
might be highly skewed, with periods of large attention going in particular at the expense
of the general pattern of diversity.
Media agenda diversity
Media agenda diversity may be used as both a dependent and an independent variable
because on a conceptual level it refers to the interplay between agenda building and
agenda setting: as journalists create fluctuating diversity patterns on the media agenda,
they may in turn influence agenda setting. Zhu (1992) started agenda-diversity research
by showing how agenda setting could be seen as a `zero-sum game, in which the rise of
one issue results in the fall of another' (p. 826). It was articulated that
the salience of a particular issue on the public agenda is a function not only of its salience on
the media agenda, which is the original agenda-setting hypothesis, but also of the salience of
competing issues on both the media and public agendas. (McCombs and Zhu, 1995: 496)
Subsequent studies confirmed this idea to large extent (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Only
recently scholars began to study media agenda diversity explicitly as an effect of how the
media agenda is shaped by journalists (Boydstun et al., 2014a). In this type of research,
agenda media diversity is used as dependent variable.
Media agenda diversity can be conceptualized as the distribution of attention among
a given set of discrete object categories in a news discourse (Tan and Weaver, 2013). The
term objects denotes the same as `attitude objects' in social psychological research: the
things we form opinions about (Carroll and McCombs, 2003). While agenda research is
traditionally focused on issues, scholars in corporate communication have also focused
on organizations and substantive and affective attributes of organizations. Media agenda
diversity may thus have qualitative and quantitative constituents: the types of object
4 Journalism 
categories and the number of categories (Peter and De Vreese, 2003). Diversity can theo-
retically vary between 100
percent concentration on one category (e.g. only banks) to
equal dispersion of attention across all categories (Jennings et al., 2011), although such
extremes are unlikely to be encountered in the news (Alexandrova et al., 2012).
Entropy
Methodologically, most communication researchers use entropy (Shannon and Weaver,
1949) to measure agenda diversity (see Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Here, entropy relates
to the distribution of attention scores across a set of selected objects (e.g. a set of corpo-
rate types), weighted by the occurrence of those objects (e.g. the amount of mentions or
articles in a newspaper on a certain day; Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Entropy is thus a
measure to examine the relative dispersion of attention across objects on an agenda. Of
course, the categorical themes may vary (e.g. issues, perspectives, or organizations),
depending on the topic under study (Boydstun et al., 2014a).
Entropy has, among other purposes, been employed as a dependent variable to meas-
ure the extent of prioritization of specific objects across a set of general objects on a
communication agenda (e.g. Jennings et al., 2011). For example, let us assume that
media attention to banks is disproportionally large for one whole news week, when com-
pared to attention to all other company types in that week. Then, attention to banks will
have a negative effect on the entropy scores within that specific week: We could say that
banks are prioritized in the news that week.
The relation between attention and agenda diversity
Media attention and object prioritization can be conceptualized through the agenda-
building approach (see, for example, Kiousis et al., 2009, 2015), which has, among other
purposes, also been used to study how crisis events trigger media attention (Denham,
2014).Agenda-building scholars have followed a model by Shoemaker and Reese (1996)
that identifies five sorts of influences on news attention: processes related to individual
journalists, media organizations, journalistic routines, external events and broader cul-
tural context (Denham, 2010). These influences can be used to briefly explain how media
attention, and in turn diversity, is by definition constrained and limited.
Day-to-day agenda building by individual journalists and news organizations is first
characterized by a systematic drive to process ample, new, and diverse information in a
continuous fashion (McQuail, 2010). Yet, a massive incongruity exits between the abun-
dant available information that journalists and media institutions potentially could pro-
cess and their capacity to actually do so (Boydstun, 2013). Because there is too much
information available to keep up with ­ psychological attention is finite, organizational
recourses are limited, and the carrying capacity of the media agenda is restricted
(Boydstun, 2013) ­ information is processed in a boundedly rational fashion (Kahneman,
2003). That is, focus lies on a given set of topics at the time because journalists and news
organizations can only keep up with so many stories at once. The necessity to focus
attention fosters routinization: journalists and media organizations have relatively stable
orientations toward specific actors and issues (Tuchman, 1978), and news is governed by
Jonkman et al. 5
steady journalistic perceptions about newsworthiness and news values (Harcup and
O'Neill, 2001). Furthermore, agenda building functions in the context of stable relations
with sources (e.g. specific companies), re-occurring events (e.g. the publication of annual
reports), and mimicking behavior of journalists (Vliegenthart and Walgrave, 2008).Also,
attention patterns emerge in the context of dominant societal discourses, such as eco-
nomic and political narratives.
All this shapes the context wherein attention patterns emerge and agenda diversity
materializes. Evidently, however, agenda building differs from day to day, resulting in
fluctuating attention patterns. Often, attention reflects relatively routinized patterns
of agenda building, with attention for a limited variety of objects. Sometimes, how-
ever, specific news objects may dominate news, often catapulted on the media agenda
by so-called newsworthy trigger events (e.g. crises). This is when agendas get punctu-
ated (Boydstun, 2013). Punctuations are frequently occurring periods of dispropor-
tional high attention to specific objects that enter the news agenda. From time to time,
media pay (often collectively) disproportional amounts of attention to specific topics
for a certain period of time (Boydstun et al., 2014b). These salience punctuations may
vary in terms of impact and duration but are an inherent characteristic of the media
agenda.
With regard to this, Boydstun et al. (2014b) differentiate between storm and non-
storm media coverage. Non-storm coverage can be considered `normal news reporting':
situations that are characterized by a relative fast chancing pattern of attention to a rela-
tive small set of agenda objects. Media storms, on the other hand, are large and lengthy
punctuations, which comprise a considerable share of the media agenda during a specific
period (Boydstun et al., 2014b). Storm coverage also differs from normal news reporting
in the sense that those large and lengthy punctuations should be associated with fewer
agenda objects.
High attention to specific agenda objects normally declines after a certain period
and the pattern of news reporting shifts back to `normal reporting', until new punctua-
tions occur. This pattern of continuing trade-offs between salience punctuations and
`normal reporting' produces a diversity pattern that fits the characteristic of `punctu-
ated equilibrium dynamics' (Boydstun, 2013: 54). Journalists try to offer a relative
diverse palette of actors, issues, and perspectives, but in practice they end up focusing
on a limited set of objects at a time. Since this continuing pattern of generating news
is often interrupted by periods of focused attention to specific objects, agenda diversity
will vary over time.
Media storms are often caused by trigger events. Such events tend to `shift the atten-
tion of the media, refocusing attention to problems or issues that are either novel or were
previously unattended or underattended' (Wolfe et al., 2013: 180). Most of these issues
are catapulted into public attention by the media trough trigger events (Nisbet and Huge,
2006), but the `media inevitably exhaust dramatic elements of the issue that are needed
to sustain interest' (p. 6). However, some issues or actors remain highly visible on the
media agenda and start to receive structurally more attention than other objects (Hilgartner
and Bosk, 1988) because they disrupt social order to a large extent (e.g. severe environ-
mental, political, and economic crises qualify; see Boydstun, 2013) and are extremely
`loaded' with news value (e.g. dramatic, negative, personal, related to elites).
6 Journalism 
The erratic day-to-day/week-to-week patterns of low and high attention fluctua-
tions should thus not influence the pattern of long-term media agenda diversity since
the complete diversity pattern absorbs the individual salience punctuations (Jennings
et al., 2011: 5). However, agenda objects that structurally ­ or at least for longer peri-
ods in time ­ receive more attention than others could influence long-term agenda
diversity negatively (Jennings et al., 2011). The critical question in this regard is to
what extent objects have the capacity to dominate the news agenda over longer time
periods.
The effect of attention to banks on long-term media
agenda diversity
The financial crisis that started in 2007 can be seen as a major trigger event for news
attention to the financial system, and banks in particular. Media attributed the crunch of
the financial markets to a large extent to commercial banks (Bennett and Kottasz, 2012).
Still, critics have also held media accountable for not fulfilling their watchdog role, fail-
ing to warn the public about the risks and dangers of commercial banking earlier
(Manning, 2013). In effect, the financial crisis turned out to be not only a banking crisis
but also a journalistic crisis.
In the recent years, journalists and news organizations have been forced to reorientate
their positions vis-a-vis the banking sector and the financial system in general. Ever
since the beginning of the financial crisis, commercial banks have been a focal point of
attention for journalists around the world (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). This suggests that
banks have been `prioritized species' in the mainstream news discourses about compa-
nies in this period of financial and economic turmoil. In the Netherlands, this is also
reflected in the frequent high waves of media attention around issues like fraud (e.g. the
Rabobank Libor scandal in 2013), financial deficits and bankruptcy (e.g. state aid to
ING, Fortis and ABN Amro in 2008), bonuses (e.g. ABN Amro in 2014), and the role of
banks in Europe and abroad (e.g. relations to banks and the financial deficits of Greece
from 2009 onward). During the crisis, the attention for banks is unlikely to have been at
the same high level all the time ­ it is expected to go up and down with the occurrence of
new developments and events.
In sum, one can anticipate (a) overall higher levels of attention for the banking sector
compared to other sectors during an economic crisis and (b) more fluctuation in atten-
tion compared to other sectors. In the context of the above, this means that we expect
that news about banks will punctuate the news discourse, on average, more often than
news about other firm types. We argue that banks will be structurally prioritized when
compared to other company types and are thus able to `push' other companies from the
agenda.
Structural prioritization means a systematic negative effect on the diversity of the
whole agenda. Hence, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H1. Increased attention to banks leads to a structural decline in agenda diversity in
Dutch news between 2007 and 2013.

Method
Data and case
Our dataset consists of all company news articles about highly visible company types,
published in the economy section of NRC Handelsblad, between 1 January 2007 and 31
December 2013.
In the study's time period, the Dutch economy was first affected by the US mortgage
crisis (beginning 2007). Loaning money became more expensive; banks became increas-
ingly precautious with mortgage lending; the Dutch stock exchange (AEX) dropped; and
consumer confidence and trust in the economy and banks declined. In September 2008,
the US credit and banking crisis led to a banking crisis in the Netherlands. Hereafter, the
crisis evolved into the Euro and a broader economic crisis, which can overall be charac-
terized by a decreasing gross domestic product (since 2008), declining purchasing power
(from 2010 to 2013), and declining employment (since 2007) followed by a gradual
increase (since late 2009).
Although the newspaper market suffered from a severe decline in circulation rates
since the start of the economic crisis in 2007, quality newspapers are still regarded as a
major information source in the Netherlands (Bakker and Scholten, 2014). The
Netherlands is a prototypical example of the `democratic corporatist model' (Hallin and
Mancini, 2004), with independent media, high level of professionalization of journalism,
as well as traditionally high circulation numbers of newspapers.
NRC Handelsblad is one of the largest daily quality newspapers in the Netherlands (the
other large newspapers are Telegraaf, Trouw, Algemeen Dagblad, and de Volkskrant).
NRC stands out for its broad and extensive coverage on economic issues (Bakker and
Scholten, 2014), which makes it particularly suitable for examining news related to the
economy (Hollanders and Vliegenthart, 2011).Apractical advantage regarding our choice
to study NRC coverage is that its digital database, in contrast to the other outlets, covers
clear sections. This allowed us to automatically separate economic news from other news.
We started with retrieving all articles that were published in NRC Handelsblad in the
period of study from the LexisNexis database (N=243,171) and subsequently narrowed
down the sample to meet our requirements. First, we identified all articles that were pub-
lished in the Economy section of the paper (N=29,843) because news about corporations
can be conceptualized as a sub-category of economic news (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2015).
Further inspection of the data showed that not all entries contained full articles (as in
written texts) but occasionally were lists or tables (e.g. stock exchange ratings). By plot-
ting a histogram of the number-to-word ratios of the articles, we determined that entries
in which 16percent of the characters are numbers instead of words are extremely likely
to belong to the category of non-articles. We removed them, which narrowed down the
dataset to 29,595 articles.
Preprocessing and determination of relevant companies
All preprocessing and large parts of the analysis were done using a program that we
named INCA (Infrastructure for Automated Content Analysis). The program involves a
8 Journalism 
set of Python scripts that we previously developed in another context (see Trilling and
Jonkman, 2015) and that will be made available to any interested researcher. INCA con-
tains a parser that separates individual articles from metadata like publication date, sec-
tion, author, and the like, and subsequently stores the parsed data in a MongoDB
database.1 This database was then used for preprocessing and cleaning the data, which
was also done within our program.
Next to steps like conversion to lowercase and the removal of stop words and punctua-
tion, we paid extensive attention to the recoding of potential firms mentioned in our data
in order to circumvent underestimation of news attention to firms. We manually compiled
a list of companies ­ based on existing lists of Dutch and Non-Dutch multinationals, and
AEX stock market­listed firms potentially relevant for our study. If a firm on this list
contained more than one word or had synonyms or different spellings, our program used
regular expressions to replace these by a unique term that we defined. For example, Air
France KLM and different variations on it were all converted into Air_France_KLM and
ABN AMRO into ABN_AMRO. In addition, we supplemented abbreviations like ABN
by the full (new) name, if the full name was mentioned in the same text.
Determination of most prominent companies
In a next phase, we compiled a list of the 100 companies with the highest media visibil-
ity. Instead of using pre-existing lists or rankings with company names (e.g. the Fortune
500 ranking for most reputable firms), which is common practice in research involving
news about corporations, we propose to inductively define which companies to select.
This approach suits our type of research better since news media have their own selection
mechanisms for relevant information (Shoemaker and Reese, 1996). In other words,
being able to inductively retrieve the most visible firms in the news gives us an idea of
the media prominence of corporations. To this end, we calculated the frequency of each
word in the whole dataset, with the exception of words (including their conjugations)
that appear in a Dutch dictionary. For validity reasons, we compared our pre-existing list
of companies to the dictionary list to avoid missing firm names that may appear in the
dictionary. Two names (TomTom and Amstel)2 were found and they were removed from
the dictionary. This dictionary filter function gave us a list with several thousand words
(predominantly referring to specific social actors and issues; i.e. non-Dutch words).
Subsequently, we selected the first 100 companies on that list manually. We also consid-
ered using named entity recognition for this task, but decided to use the dictionary filter
approach instead to minimize the chance of missing a company.3
As we are interested in news about companies, we included only articles in which at
least one of the 100 most media prominent companies was mentioned in our further
analysis. This narrowed the final dataset down to 14,363 articles.
Independent variables: Attention to company types
We allocated each of the identified firms to an overarching company type, using the Global
Industry Classification Standards (GICS) industry classification scheme, which is a clas-
sification scheme for company types commonly used in economic and financial research
Jonkman et al. 9
and practice (see: Hrazdil et al., 2013).4 We based the allocation process on information
from the Orbis and Osiris databases. Both databases are commonly used sources in eco-
nomic and strategy research involving corporations. The databases contain all sorts of
data about public and private companies worldwide, including information about the
GICS classification of firms. All the Top 100 companies that we detected in our data were
also present in the Orbis and Osiris databases. In accordance with the way the Orbis and
Osiris organize their data, we defined our company types on the GICS `industry groups'
level.According to the GICS scheme, there are 24 company types in total in this overarch-
ing category. On the basis of the information provided by Orbis and Osiris, we were able
to allocate the 100 media prominent companies to 17 (of the 24) distinct company type
categories: (1) Utilities; (2) Transportation; (3) Telecommunication Service; (4)
Technology Hardware and Equipment; (5) Software and Services; (6) Semiconductors
and Semiconductor Equipment; (7) Real Estate; (8) Media; (9) Materials; (10) Insurance;
(11) Food and Staples Retailing; (12) Energy; (13) Diversified Financials; (14) Consumer
DurablesandApparel;(15)CapitalGoods;(16)Banks;(17)AutomobilesandComponents.
Those 17 company types could thus be considered `media prominent company types'.5
We used the aggregated number of mentions in a week of all company types as inde-
pendent variables in our analysis. We chose a weekly level of analyses because weeks
refer to the weekly cycle of news presentation (Boydstun et al., 2014a).6 This means that
it is likely that those periods of normal news reporting and/or salience punctuations begin
and end at the beginning of news weeks. The analytic lens of a daily level can be best
used to investigate the dynamics of high fluctuations reporting, whereas a monthly level
of analysis is more suited for long-term events.
Dependent variable: Media agenda diversity
To measure media agenda diversity, we use Shannon's H entropy (Shannon and Weaver,
1949), which is the most used measure in agenda diversity research (Jennings et al.,
2011; John and Jennings, 2010; Jones and Baumgartner, 2005). Shannon's H is based on
the distribution of observations across a given number of distinct object categories,
weighted by the occurrence of these object categories (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015).
Mathematically, the formula is represented in the following form
H p x ln p x
i
i
n
i
= - ( ) ( )
( )
=

1
(1)
In our case, entropy (H) is the negative sum for all firm types of the likelihood p(x)
that a firm type x is allocated to a specific industry segment i, multiplied by the natural
logarithm of that likelihood (Jennings et al., 2011).As ln(0) is undefined, we replaced the
zero with a very small proportion: 0.0000001. This is common procedure in agenda-
setting research (Boydstun et al., 2014a). While the minimum score of Shannon's H is
always equal to zero (complete focus of attention on one category), the maximum score
is dependent on the amount of categories. Our study is based on 17 distinct categories,
which implies that the maximum value for Shannon's H is ln(17)2.833.
10 Journalism 
Control variables
We used the following variables as control variables in the analysis.
Volume.It is conceivable that a higher volume of coverage might give room to more
diverse coverage. We therefore control for the amount of (1) words used in company
news per week and (2) the amount of articles in news about corporations per week.
Crisis dummy.We have argued that commercial banks have been media salient, espe-
cially in the beginning of the economic crisis, during the credit crisis. We therefore con-
trol for this specific period. The exogenous variable `credit crisis' is operationalized as
the period between the first week of July 2007 and the first week of November 2009 and
captured by a dummy variable (0
=
no crisis, 1
=
crisis). According to Kleinnijenhuis
et al. (2015), this period was a phase in which several banks received a lot of media atten-
tion. This phase started with a mortgage crisis in the United States. On 15 September
2008, Lehman Brothers (a US investment bank) crashed, causing a shock in the financial
system. Suddenly, they were even more in the spotlight than before. In 2008 and 2009, a
series of severe crises happened, involving several foreign as well as Dutch firms, espe-
cially banks (e.g. Fortis, ABN Amro, ING, Ice save (an Icelandic bank), and the DSB
bank). This phase ends in the last week of October 2009, when the problems around the
deficits in Greece were announced (Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). We argued before that
media attention to banks `exploded' during the credit crisis. It is therefore relevant to
control for this period.
Time-series analysis: Partly adjusted Autoregressive Distributed Lag model
Toanalyzethedata,weusedtime-seriesanalysisandbuiltapartlyadjustedAutoregressive
Distributed Lag (ADL) model. Since our data have the form of time series, with weekly
observations, we have to take into consideration the specific characteristics of time
dependent data. First, however, it is necessary to determine whether the time series are
stationary (Vliegenthart, 2014) ­ that is, the mean is not dependent on the time of obser-
vation. To this end, we used a Dickey Fuller Unit Root Test ­ to test null hypothesis that
the series are non-stationary. This test revealed that this null hypothesis can be rejected
and the series are indeed stationary (Z=-13.48, p<0.001). Consequently, the series do
not have to be differenced.
Autoregression and time
A second issue with time series is the overtime dependency. In our model, we include a
lagged dependent variable (or AR(1) component) to account for this dependency.
Autoregression (AR) refers to the extent to which the value of a variable is explained by
its own past value (t-1). In our case, this means the influence of the agenda diversity of
the previous week on the current week. We additionally also control for linearity in over
time, by adding a trend variable that takes the value of 0 for the first observation and
increases with one each week. Ljung-Box Q tests suggest that with the inclusion of the
Jonkman et al. 11
lagged dependent variable and the trend variable, the residuals do not contain any addi-
tional autocorrelation and thus the temporal dependencies in the data are well accounted
for. Furthermore, for the final model, the ADL model with one lag results in residuals
that are white noise (Ljung-Box Q-test for 20 lags=11.90, p=0.92).
In our analysis, we test the immediate effect of the attention for various company
types on agenda diversity. With the inclusion of a lagged dependent variable and a time
trend, this means that our model formally resembles a partial adjusted ADL model (De
Boef and Keele, 2008). We present our partly adjusted ADL model of media agenda
diversity in company news in three hierarchical steps: (1) the effects of the AR, trend,
and agenda volume (amount of words and amount of articles per week) have been tested;
(2) then, we included the exogenous dummy variable for the crisis; and (3) we included
the variables for the attention for the different company types.
Results
First, looking at the descriptive statistics (see Table 1), we see that attention to Banks is
on average much higher than attention for other company types, while also its standard
deviation (SD) is high (M
=
84.29, SD
=
62.75). Additionally, the maximum amount of
mentions are higher for Banks, and they are the only company type with a minimum of

three mentions per week, while the rest of the company types all have minimum scores
of 0. The level of entropy is on average relatively high since the level of entropy in this
study can theoretically fluctuate between 0 and 2.83 and has an empirically observed
range of 0.81­2.52.
Figure 1 shows the relations between overtime attention to banks and entropy, as meas-
ure for agenda diversity. As expected, the graphs show attention patterns that are charac-
terized by relatively long periods of focused attention, with low entropy levels. These
salience punctuations appear to be the heaviest during the financial crisis. Figure 1 shows
that entropy decreases during periods of frequent salience punctuations (periods of
focused attention) ­ especially during the financial crisis.
Explaining media agenda diversity
In order to explain media agenda diversity, we tested three models. The results are shown
in Table 2.
Model 0 consists of the control variables only. When adding the credit crisis dummy
to the model (Model 1), the explained variance slightly increases (R2=0.01).
Jonkman et al. 13
As was observable in Figure 1, results indicate that during the credit crisis (July 2007
to November 2009), diversity was lower (0.080, p<0.05).
However, Model 2, with the attention to all the company types added, reveals that it
is not the credit crisis as such that drives long-term agenda diversity but rather the com-
pany types mentioned in the news during the crisis.
In fact, we observe a substantial increase in explained variation in agenda diversity
(R2=0.55) when taking the visibility of company types into account as well. This is in
line with the bivariate statistics presented in Table 3 (see Appendix 1).
The bivariate analysis shows that the credit crisis (dummy) correlates highly with
Banks, Utilities, and Automobiles and Components. That explains why the credit crisis
variable becomes insignificant in Model 2.

Model 2 specifies that banks ­ as expected ­ have a significant negative impact on
agenda diversity (-0.003, p
<
0.001). This means that if banks are in the news media,
agenda diversity declines. Banks having a negative impact on agenda diversity of -0.003
indicates that, for example, in a week where 50percent of attention is attributed to banks,
agenda diversity declines with 0.0015. The effect is small yet substantial, given the theo-
retical and empirically observed range of entropy that we observed above.
Notably, Automobiles and Components also shows a significant negative impact on
diversity. Yet, the effect of this firm type is smaller when compared to the impact of
Banks (-0.001, p<0.001). An explanation for this effect might be that also the automo-
bile industry has been hit seriously by the crisis and shows considerable variation in
attention during the research period (see also Table 1).
Looking at the other firm types, we can observe another pattern. Most of the other
firm types (8 out 15) have a significant positive effect on media agenda diversity
(Utilities, Telecommunication Service, Technology Hardware and Equipment, Media,
Insurance, Food and Staples Retailing, Consumer Durables and Apparel, and
Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment). The positive effects suggest that these
sorts of firms are associated with more space on the media agenda. For example, if 5per-
cent of the attention is devoted to Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment (the
type with the strongest effect: 0.004, p<0.001), agenda diversity increases by 0.0002.
Based on these results, our hypothesis that increased attention to banks leads to a
structural decline in media diversity in the Dutch news between 2007 and 2013 can
therefore be confirmed.
Conclusion and discussion
The results of our study suggest that banks, and to a lesser extent also the `automobiles
and components' industry, have been structurally prioritized above other media promi-
nent company types in NRC company news coverage between 2007 and 2013. Most
other firm types have been associated with more agenda diversity instead of less, indicat-
ing that these corporate actors receive on average more attention only when there is a
wider set of corporate actors on the agenda. Notably, the effect sizes related to these
differences are small, while the average mean of agenda diversity is high. This suggests
that a fairly diverse company news agenda has been built and maintained during the
economic crisis. Our findings point to the structural prioritization of banks, but the pri-
oritization is fairly limited in its scope.
Despite the small size of this effect, our results are in line with the theoretical idea that
structural prioritization of corporate actors in the news through accumulated agenda
punctuations and media storms influences the structure of the whole media agenda in a
systematic way (Boydstun, 2013). In our theoretical reasoning, we argued that the space
for agenda building is inherently restricted because it reflects a `zero-sum game' (Zhu,
1992). This means that the diversity structure of media agendas can be negatively influ-
enced by attention to corporate actors if these actors receive on average more attention
than other actors. Broadly speaking, our results support this idea. Attention to banks is on
average and over time higher than all other corporate actors that are present in the news.
Furthermore, we also observed that the salience punctuations that can be attributed to
Jonkman et al. 15
banks are on average more frequent and larger than those punctuations belonging to
other kind of corporate actors. In other words, we observed more and heavier storm cov-
erage regarding banks in comparison with other company types. This indicates that banks
might be newsworthy across the board, but at some periods a lot more than in other
periods ­ and thus that news might be `event-driven' to a certain extent.
Some reflections are important in the context of these findings. The effects that we
found are small in absolute terms. Yet, since the proportion of explained variance
increased substantially when accounting for the firm type variables, this suggests that
the overall variation in the distribution of attention to company types is small. In other
words, we are able to explain a considerable proportion of the variance in agenda
diversity over time by looking at attention to the different types of companies, despite
the small effect sizes. Two processes, which are in line with our theoretical reasoning,
may explain this. First, routinized agenda building may indeed result in a very stable
pattern of attention distribution across companies and company types: that is, journal-
ists generate information about a relatively fixed set of corporate actors, which receive
relatively stable amounts of attention over time (Harcup and O'Neill, 2001). Second,
it could be that journalists indeed actively try to offer a diverse news agenda in weekly
news cycles, despite frequent agenda punctuations (Boydstun, 2013). This is also
reflected by the high mean in media agenda diversity that we found over time. In other
words, the results reflect the idea that journalists are systematically caught in an `equi-
librium': they seem to be moving around a relatively small set of actors and issues for
a certain period of time while seeking to maintain a diverse media agenda at the same
time (Boydstun, 2013: 54). As was brought up earlier, journalists were criticized for
not fulfilling their watchdog role properly, before and during the economic crisis. In
response to such critique, it might well be considered socially legitimate, or even desir-
able, that journalists pay intensified attention to particular issues, events, and actors
over longer time periods, as long as they strive to maintain a diverse agenda in general.
Our findings seem to echo that idea. An additional explanation for the small effect
sizes could be related to the size of the agenda. The economic section of the newspaper
is a relatively large agenda compared to, for example, the first page of a newspaper, a
television news bulletin, or the first page of a website. The larger the news agenda, the
more possibilities there are to construct a diverse agenda. Future research should take
different kind of news agendas and interrelated dynamics of agendas into account (e.g.
front-page news vs the rest of a newspaper, or front-pages of websites vs whole
websites).
Of course, our study has some limitations that need to be addressed. Although we
analyzed a newspaper that is known for its broad range of topics related to firms and the
economy, it is still only one news outlet. Given that we used a method to assess agenda
diversity that has not been used before in this context, we do not want to claim that our
study provides a comprehensive answer to the question how agenda diversity in eco-
nomic news can be explained. Instead, we rather see our case study as a point of depar-
ture for future research. In particular, our findings have to be re-tested across a broader
variety of news outlets (e.g. diverse newspapers, online news, television news) because
the characteristics of news outlets might play an important role in the way attention to
news is distributed. Similarly, cross-national comparisons may reveal structural
16 Journalism 
differences between countries with, for example, different media systems. In addition,
we focused explicitly on large and highly media salient firms in a specific time period
(the economic crisis), neglecting, for instance, the bulk of medium-sized businesses in
their daily business. Future research could look at longer time periods to investigate
long-term general trends and the importance of key events. The contribution of our study,
therefore, goes beyond the ­ admittedly limited ­ case we have studied: We hope that the
framework for assessing agenda diversity, which we introduced, can serve as a useful
inspiration for such larger studies.
Next to broadening the scope of such studies by introducing comparative or long-term
elements, future research on agenda diversity in company news content could consider
not only organizational actors but also issues. It would, for example, be interesting to
explore the variation of issues in news about organizations and examine to what extent
these issues are prioritized in comparison with one another. In particular, issue­actor
relations could be taken into account (see Kleinnijenhuis et al., 2015). Because agenda
diversity could be seen as a particular instance of the broader concept of `attention diver-
sity' (Boydstun et al., 2014a), such ideas could also be translated to other realms of
media content research. This type of broader conceptualization allows researchers to also
incorporate other, more substantial, content characteristics in diversity research (e.g.
frames, perspectives, and discourses).
Finally, our study particularly seeks to inform agenda-building and agenda-set-
ting research. In addition to our approach, scholars could use Shoemaker and
Reese's (1996) `theory of a hierarchy of influences on media content', to examine
how variables on micro, mezzo, and macro levels influence agenda diversity.
Furthermore, in addition to the existing body of knowledge on the interaction
between agenda diversity and agenda setting, future research should examine how
media agenda diversity moderates the two-step process of agenda building and
agenda setting. For example, the news-mediated influence of public relations efforts
(e.g. attempts to influence the public through the media) could be moderated by
long-term agenda diversity. It is up to future research to enhance the design we used
and explore such possible effects.
