Using the 1992 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement, relationships were analyzed between
stage of readiness for smoking cessation and background characteristics, smoking behaviors, and smoking-related
attitudes among smokers aged 18-29, 30-49, and >50 years. For each age group, an ordinal logistic regression
model was computed to identify correlates of readiness to quit. The youngest smokers had attitudes most favorable
to being ready to try to quit smoking. For smokers aged 30-49, the influence of a medical provider and perceived
health effects of smoking were important correlates of readiness. Among smokers 50 and older, those with realistic
health consequences of smoking and those who perceived smoking as addictive were more likely to be ready to quit.
The effectiveness of smoking cessation programs might be improved by matching interventions to a smoker's age
and stage in the smoking cessation process.
A LTHOUGH its prevalence has declined substantially,
/ x cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of pre-
ventable death in the United States (Fiore et al., 1989;
McGinnis and Foege, 1993). Extrapolating from present
rates of initiation and cessation, at least 22 percent of adults
are expected to be smoking by the year 2000 (Pierce et al.,
1989). Morbidity and mortality, especially due to lung can-
cer, chronic obstructive lung disease, and heart disease, are
increased among both men and women who smoke (Kaplan
et al., 1987; Rimer et al., 1990; U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services [USDHHS], 1989). Smoking cessation
has major and immediate health benefits for persons of all
ages with and without existing smoking-related disease
(Gordon, Kannel, and McGee, 1974; Jajich, Ostfeld, and
Freeman, 1984; LaCroix et al., 1991; Rogers et al., 1985;
USDHHS, 1990a). Because of the avoidable health risks
associated with cigarette smoking, smoking cessation is one
of the most important public health concerns today.
In spite of more than two decades of research, continued
effort is needed to develop effective smoking cessation
strategies for adults of all ages (Glynn, Boyd, and Gruman,
1990; Lichtenstein and Glasgow, 1992). One important
strategy is to take into account the readiness of individuals
to change their smoking behaviors. A widely accepted way
to operationally define readiness to quit smoking is stage
of change, a key theoretical component of the Transtheoret-
ical Model of health behavior change (Prochaska and
DiClemente, 1983). According to the model, modification
of addictive behaviors involves progression through five
stages: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation,
Action, and Maintenance (Prochaska, DiClemente, and
Norcross, 1992). Most smokers recycle through some or all
of the stages several times before they are able to stop
smoking permanently. The utility of the Transtheoretical
Model in predicting smoking behavior change has been
supported by numerous studies (Prochaska, DiClemente,
and Norcross, 1992; Prochaska et al., 1994).
Unfortunately, few published studies have examined the
distribution of the stages of change in representative, popu-
lation-based samples of smokers. Available data show
varying distributions of current smokers across stages of
readiness to quit (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Prepa-
ration). In a random-digit-dial telephone survey sample in
Rhode Island, 42 percent of smokers were in Precontem-
plation, 40 percent were in Contemplation, and 18 percent
were in Preparation (Fava, Velicer, and Prochaska, 1995).
Stage distributions reported from a California survey some-
what parallel the trend from Rhode Island with 37 percent
of smokers in Precontemplation, 47 percent in Contempla-
tion, and 16 percent in Preparation (Kaplan et al., 1993).
Using a slightly different algorithm for assigning smokers
to a stage, a prevalence survey in South Australia found 24
percent of smokers in Precontemplation, 47 percent in
Contemplation, and 29 percent in Preparation (Owen et al.,
1992). Variability in these distributions may be attributable,
at least in part, to the fact that the definition used by Owen
et al. (1992) did not require a quit attempt in the previous
year as one of the criteria for classification into the Prepa-
ration stage. To date, there has not been a published report
of the stage distribution of a nationally representative sam-
ple of current smokers in the United States. Interventions
have been developed from surveys of regional or local
samples. Knowing the stage distribution of smokers in the
general population has important benefits for refining
stage-matched interventions for more broadly representa-
tive samples of current smokers.
The Transtheoretical Model proposes that interventions
be designed with the realistic objective of moving persons
sequentially from one stage to another. The majority of
existing interventions tend to recruit persons ready to make
a quit attempt and focus on making the transition from the
Preparation to the Action stage. However, as the above
studies suggest, approximately 80 percent of smokers are
in Precontemplation or Contemplation, and most currently
S212
SMOKING CESSATION S213
available interventions are not the most effective for them.
Therefore, there is often a mismatch between a smoker's
readiness to quit and the goals of the intervention. Interven-
tions that match materials to a participant's stage of readi-
ness to change have the potential for significant impact by
employing the broader, more representative recruitment
strategies of public health programs while tailoring the
intervention to the needs and characteristics of smokers in
each stage (Velicer and DiClemente, 1993; Velicer et al.,
1995).
A second important strategy to improve the likelihood of
successful smoking cessation programs is to understand
differences among age subgroups of the population.
Despite the extensive literature on smoking cessation
strategies for the general population and for subgroups of
smokers defined by selected demographic characteristics,
only limited attention has been given to age as a basis for
designing strategies that can motivate and assist smokers to
quit. Furthermore, most results have not been presented in
ways that allow making age-related interpretations.
Available data have shown inconsistent associations
between age and stage in the smoking cessation process.
For instance, the Centers for Disease Control reported that
the proportion of smokers who say that they want to quit
smoking is lower among smokers age 50 and older (57%)
than it is among those younger than 50 years of age (68%;
USDHHS, 1990b). In a community-based demonstration
project, Lichtenstein, Lando, and Nothwehr (1994) found
that older smokers (55 to 74) expressed less interest in quit-
ting compared to younger smokers (25 to 54). In an analy-
sis of a random sample of smokers in three age groups, 18
to 29, 30 to 49, and 50 years or older, Kviz et al. (1994)
found that the oldest smokers were least likely to say they
planned to quit someday. However, among smokers who
said they planned to quit someday, the oldest were most
likely to plan to quit within the next three months. In an
analysis of two random samples of smokers, Velicer et al.
(1995) identified similarities by age in the distribution of
smokers in Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Prepara-
tion except for smokers age 65 and older. In one sample, a
greater percentage of the oldest smokers were in the Prepa-
ration stage relative to the younger age groups, while in the
other sample older smokers were disproportionately in the
Precontemplation stage. Due to these inconsistencies, it is
important to better understand the relationship between age
and stage of readiness in the smoking cessation process
using a nationally representative sample. More information
about the association between age and readiness to quit is
important to the further development of age-tailored smok-
ing cessation strategies (Kviz et al., 1994, 1995; Orleans et
al., 1994; Rimer and Orleans, 1994; Rimer et al., 1994).
This article presents results from an analysis of correlates
of stage of readiness for smoking cessation among three
age groups (18-29, 30-49, and 50 years and older) in a
national sample of current smokers. Our first goal was to
analyze differences by age in stage of readiness to quit
smoking. Our second goal was to identify age-specific cor-
relates of stage of readiness. Finally, we compared signifi-
cant correlates of stage of readiness across the three age
groups.
METHODS
Sample
The data for this study were from the public release tape
of the 1992 National Health Interview Survey-Cancer Con-
trol Supplement (NHIS-CCS), which is the most recent
release of data about smoking attitudes and behaviors from
the NHIS that allows for determining stage of readiness for
smoking cessation (National Center for Health Statistics,
1993). The NHIS is an annual household interview of ran-
domly selected persons 18 years of age and older. The Can-
cer Control Supplement was an additional set of questions
asked of half the sample. Although previous Supplements
have been conducted throughout the entire year with the
NHIS, the 1992 Supplement was only administered for the
first half of the year due to funding limitations.
The analysis included 2,599 adults 18 years of age or older
who reported smoking cigarettes every day. Smokers were
grouped into three age categories: 18-29 (N = 539; mean =
23.9 years), 30-49 (N = 1302; mean = 38.6 years), and
50-89 (N = 605; mean = 61.1 years). We chose these cate-
gories because they are generally representative of three
groups of smokers based on their smoking histories. Smokers
18 to 29 can be characterized as recently initiated smokers,
smokers 30 to 49 as established smokers, and those 50 and
older as long-term smokers. This was supported by differ-
ences in the mean number of smoking years reported by sub-
jects in each of these age groups: 8.7 for those 18 to 29, 21.4
for those 30 to 49, and 41.3 for those 50 and older (p < .001).
Also, this age categorization enabled us to compare our find-
ings with those from other studies (Kviz et al., 1994; Orleans
et al., 1991, 1994; Rimer et al., 1990).
Dependent Variable
Because our sample consisted of current smokers, we clas-
sified all subjects into one of the first three stages of change,
which indicate a smoker's readiness to stop smoking. We
used the operational definitions specified by Prochaska,
DiClemente, and colleagues (DiClemente et al., 1991;
Prochaska and DiClemente, 1992): Precontemplation, in
which a smoker has no intention to quit within the next 6
months; Contemplation, in which a smoker is seriously con-
sidering quitting within the next 6 months, or a smoker is
seriously planning to quit within the next 30 days but has not
made a quit attempt in the past year; and Preparation, in
which a smoker is seriously planning to quit within the next
30 days and has made at least one quit attempt in the past
year. Unfortunately, recently quit and former smokers could
not be classified into the Action or Maintenance stages due to
errors in the NHIS questionnaire skip patterns.
We chose these operational definitions of stages of readi-
ness because they are the most widely used in the smoking
cessation literature. Each stage represents a period of time
as well as a set of tasks and intentions needed for move-
ment to the next stage. Previous studies have documented
that a recent quit attempt that resulted in a relapse is an
important prompt for a future quit attempt, and that a proxi-
mal intention to quit along with a recent quit attempt is an
important distinction between smokers contemplating quit-
ting and those prepared for action (DiClemente et al., 1991;
S214 CLARK ETAL.
Prochaska and DiClemente, 1992). Also, DiClemente and
colleagues (1991) verified that this categorical classification
of smokers is predictive of both quitting attempts and ces-
sation success.
Independent Variables
We selected independent variables that were identified in
previous studies as potential correlates of stage of readiness
to stop smoking or were related to a smoker's age. Our
selection of covariates and their response categories was
constrained by those available in the NHIS-CCS; three
major types were selected: (a) background characteristics,
(b) smoking behaviors, and (c) attitudes about smoking
cessation.
Background characteristics. -- Background characteris-
tics included gender, ethnicity, education, income, and mar-
ital status. Ethnicity, reported as White, Black, Hispanic,
American Indian, Eskimo, and several other Asian groups,
was recoded into Non-White and White. Education was
measured as number of years of formal education and was
recoded as less than high school graduate (0-11 years),
high school graduate (12 years), and some college or more
(> 13 years). Income was measured in $1000 increments
from less than $1000 to $50,000 or more, and was divided
at the median into less than $20,000 and $20,000 or more.
In addition, due to the large percentage of persons who
declined to report income or did not know (N = 295,
14.0%), an unknown category was also created to avoid the
loss of a large portion of the sample. Marital status was
reported as married, widowed, divorced, separated, or
never married and was reclassified as married and not mar-
ried. Self-rated health was measured as excellent, very
good, good, fair, and poor.
Background characteristics also included two measures
of the influence of health care providers on helping a
smoker to stop. The influence of a medical provider was
measured by two questions asking smokers if they had seen
a medical doctor in the past year and if this medical doctor
had advised them to stop smoking. Responses were com-
bined into a single 3-category variable: no medical visit in
past year, medical visit without advice to quit, and medical
visit with advice to quit. The influence of a dental provider
was measured similarly by asking smokers if they had seen
a dentist in the past year and if the dentist had advised them
to stop smoking, with these responses then recoded into a
3-category variable.
Smoking behaviors. -- Smoking behaviors were mea-
sured with two indicators. Average number of cigarettes
smoked per day was measured as a continuous variable and
was classified into less than 1 pack (1-19 cigarettes) and 1
pack or more (> 20 cigarettes). Adjusted percent of lifetime
spent smoking was defined as the proportion of time
beyond age 12 in which an individual reported smoking on
a daily basis (computed by dividing the total number of
years a smoker reported smoking cigarettes daily by current
age minus 12 years). This measure was categorized into 75
percent or less and more than 75 percent (the median
value).
Smoking cessation attitudes. -- Smoking cessation atti-
tudes were measured with six indicators. First, smokers
were asked if they thought smoking affects their health now
(yes or no). Second, smokers were asked to rate on a 3-
point scale (unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely) the like-
lihood of serious health problems if they continue to
smoke. Third, the perceived addictive nature of smoking
was measured by asking smokers whether they thought
smoking was a habit, an addiction, neither, or both.
Responses were recoded into addictive (addictive or both)
and not addictive (habit or neither).
The fourth attitude indicator was a count of the number
of agreements with five statements about cigarette smoking,
coded so that higher scores indicated a more favorable atti-
tude toward not smoking: (a) So many things cause cancer
that it doesn't matter if you smoke (reverse coded); (b) The
smoke from other people's cigarettes is harmful to you; (c)
Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by cigarette
smoking; (d) Smoking should not be allowed in indoor
public places; and (e) Even if a person has smoked for
more than 20 years, there is a health benefit to quitting.
Next, respondents were asked a 3-point rating (good, fair,
poor) of the perceived likelihood of surviving lung cancer.
To include the large percentage of smokers who sponta-
neously responded "not sure" (N = 323, 15.4%), a fourth cat-
egory was created. Finally, smokers were asked to rate on a
3-point scale (not annoying, somewhat annoying, very
annoying) their annoyance with the smoke from other peo-
ple's cigarettes. The categories of "not annoying" and
"somewhat annoying" were combined for all analyses. For
all measures of smoking cessation attitudes, a response of
"don't know" or refusal were coded in the least favorable
category, because noncommittal answers were considered
negative indicators of motivation to quit smoking.
Analysis Plan
For all analyses, we used the SUDAAN Release 7.0 soft-
ware package (Shah, Barnwell, and Bieler, 1996) in order
to account for the sample weights and the complex survey
design of the National Health Interview Survey.
Independent variables by age. -- We tested the null
hypothesis that smokers in the three age groups (18-29,
30-49, and > 50 years) did not differ on each of the inde-
pendent variables. Pearson x2 statistics were used to com-
pare percentage distributions for categorical variables, and
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare means
for continuous variables.
Stage of readiness by age. -- In order to determine if the
distribution of the stages of readiness to quit was similar
across age categories, we used the likelihood-ratio x2 statis-
tic. First, we computed an overall test for associations
between the three age groups and the three stages of readi-
ness categories (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and
Preparation). Then, we decomposed the overall relationship
between stage of readiness and age by partitioning the dis-
tributions into finer subdivisions (Reynolds, 1977). To
determine differences in the likelihood of being in Precon-
templation versus Contemplation, we compared smokers
SMOKING CESSATION S215
18-29 with those > 50 and then combined the youngest and
oldest smokers and compared them to smokers 30-49. Sim-
ilarly, to determine differences in the likelihood of being in
early (Precontemplation and Contemplation) versus later
(Preparation) stages of readiness, we compared smokers
18--29 with those > 50 and then combined the youngest and
oldest smokers and compared them to smokers 30-49.
Correlates of stage of readiness: Multivariate analyses
by age. -- For each of the three age groups, we fit a pro-
portional odds model (cf. Agresti, 1990, pp. 322-324) to
identify independent variables that were correlated with
readiness to quit. The proportional odds model is a logistic
regression model for ordinal data. Its general form is:
log
?x{Yi<k)
Pr{ Yi>k)
= ou - x ,
where Yi is the ordinal response for subject /; x, is a vector
of explanatory variables; p is a vector of regression param-
eters; and the cu are cut points. For the three stages of
readiness, Yi takes on values 1, 2, or 3, and two cut points
are required.
In a logistic regression for binary (0,1) response, (3 is the
increase in log odds of positive response corresponding to a
unit increase in xi. Interpretation in a proportional odds
model is similar: 3 corresponds to the increased log odds of
being in a higher stage of readiness for every unit increase
in xi. Consequently, ep is the odds ratio for being in a
higher stage when comparing two levels of a covariate.
Positive values of 3 correspond to positive associations
between Yi and xi.
The following model-building procedures were employed:
1. We fit a proportional odds model for each of the three
age groups.
2. Using a likelihood-ratio statistic, each final age-specific
model was compared to an age-specific model that
included all covariates as main effects (i.e., the largest
model we were willing to consider). A nonsignificant dif-
ference between the two models was regarded as evi-
dence that the final model represented an appropriate fit
to the data. An informal check of the proportional odds
assumption for each final model was made by comparing
the log-likelihood to that from a multinomial model.
3. To test whether the covariates differed across age groups,
we fit a single ordinal logistic regression model to the
entire sample. In order to do this, the model included
terms for the interaction between age and each of the
covariates that were significant in any of the separate
age-specific models. Significance of interaction terms
was assessed using likelihood-ratio statistics. A signifi-
cant interaction term indicated that the nature of a partic-
ular association was different across age groups.
RESULTS
Background Characteristics and Smoking Behaviors by Age
As shown in Table 1, we found significant age-related
differences for every background characteristic except
gender. Although most smokers in each group were White,
the largest proportion of non-White smokers were age
30-49. The oldest smokers (those 50 years or older) were
most likely to have less than a high school education,
whereas smokers 30-49 were most likely to have been edu-
cated beyond high school. Smokers 30-49 were also most
likely to have incomes of $20,000 or more. The youngest
smokers were least likely to have been married or living
with a partner.
As compared to the two younger age groups, the oldest
smokers expressed lower self-ratings of health. The oldest
smokers were most likely to have made a visit to a medical
doctor within the past year. Among those making a medical
visit, the oldest smokers were also most likely to report
having been given advice to quit smoking. On the other
hand, the oldest smokers were least likely to have made a
dental visit in the past year. However, among those making
a dental visit, smokers aged 30-49 were least likely to have
received advice to quit smoking during the visit. Average
cigarettes smoked per day and the percentage of smokers
who had been smoking for 75 percent or more of their life-
time (since age 12) were positively associated with age.
Smoking-Related Attitudes
Age differences were found for all six attitude indicators
(Table 2). Although the age-related trends were not strong
for any one indicator, the oldest smokers consistently
expressed attitudes least favorable to smoking cessation.
That is, the oldest smokers were least likely to think that
smoking affects their health now, that there is a strong like-
lihood of serious health problems from smoking, and that
smoking is addictive. The oldest smokers were also least
likely to agree with statements about the harms of smoking
and were most likely to erroneously believe that the likeli-
hood of surviving lung cancer is good. Finally, the oldest
smokers were least likely to express that they become very
annoyed by smoke from other people's cigarettes.
Stage of Readiness To Quit Smoking by Age
As shown in Table 3, about 60 percent of all smokers
were in the Precontemplation stage, more than 30 percent
were in the Contemplation stage, and less than 10 percent
were in the Preparation stage. Table 3 also shows that
although the results were not exceptionally strong, there
was an overall association between age and stage of readi-
ness to quit smoking. Specifically, while smokers 18-29
and > 50 did not differ in the likelihood of being in the
Contemplation versus Precontemplation stage, those aged
30-49 were more likely than the other two age groups to be
in the Contemplation stage. There were no differences by
age in the likelihood of being in early (Precontemplation
and Contemplation) versus later (Preparation) stages of
readiness to quit.
Correlates of Readiness To Quit Smoking
Table 4 presents the final ordinal logistic regression mod-
els of readiness to quit smoking. The first three columns of
the table are results of the final age-specific models of
readiness to quit. In these models, the odds ratios are pro-
portional for all adjacent categories and are interpreted as
the relative odds of being in a higher stage of readiness.

For instance, among smokers 18 to 29, non-Whites were
1.8 times more likely than Whites to be in a more advanced
stage of readiness (Contemplation vs Precontemplation or
Preparation vs Contemplation). A covariate is considered
significant if the 95% confidence interval excludes 1.0.
The pattern of significant covariates differed by age, as
indicated by the fact that only one variable was significant
among all three age groups. Agreeing with statements about
the harms of smoking was positively associated with readi-
ness to quit smoking for all smokers. Among smokers
18-29 years, the only other significant correlate of readi-
ness to quit was race. Non-Whites were more likely to be in
higher stages of readiness. Among the 30-49 age group,
smokers were more likely to be in higher stages of readi-
ness if they had more than a high school education, had
received advice to quit smoking in the past year during a
medical visit, had been smoking for 75 percent or less of
their lifetime, thought smoking affects their health now,
perceived serious health effects of smoking, and were very
annoyed by smoke from other people's cigarettes.
The oldest smokers were similar to those aged 30-49 in
that they also were more likely to be in higher stages of
readiness to quit if they had received advice to quit during
the past year from a medical provider, had been smoking
for 75 percent or less of their lifetime, and perceived seri-
ous health problems from smoking. In addition, among the
oldest smokers, readiness to quit was associated with smok-
ing less than one pack of cigarettes per day and perceiving
smoking to be addictive.
The fourth column in Table 4 presents the results of the
tests of interactions between age and each of the covariates.
We found three significant interactions by age. First, there
was a positive effect of education on readiness to quit in the
30-49 age group, whereas there was no association with
education among the youngest and oldest age groups. Sec-
ond, perceiving smoking as addictive was not associated

DISCUSSION
Stage of Readiness To Quit Smoking
This is the first published report, to our knowledge, of
the distribution of stages of readiness to quit smoking in a
nationally representative sample of current smokers in the
United States. Other studies of random samples of current
smokers have found the distribution of stage of readiness to
be approximately 40 percent in Precontemplation, 40 per-
cent in Contemplation, and 20 percent in Preparation (Fava,
Velicer, and Prochaska, 1995; Kaplan et al., 1993; Velicer
et al., 1995). However, in this nationally representative
sample, we found a higher percentage of smokers of all
ages in Precontemplation (60%), a somewhat smaller per-
centage in Contemplation (33%), and a lower percentage in
Preparation (7%). The NHIS-CCS data show that, among
current smokers, the proportion in the Precontemplation
stage is about 50 percent greater, and the proportion in the
Preparation stage is about 50 percent less than was previ-
ously thought based on data from other studies that did not
use nationally representative samples (Velicer et al;, 1995).
The distribution of smokers by stage of readiness has
important implications for the emphasis in smoking cessa-
tion programs. Our findings support the conclusion of

Velicer et al. (1995) that smoking cessation programs
should focus on motivating the majority of smokers (who
are in Precontemplation and Contemplation) to try to quit
smoking. However, the higher percentages in Precontem-
plation and Contemplation also show that this need is even
greater than was suggested by the estimates presented in
other studies (Fava, Velicer, and Prochaska, 1995; Kaplan
et al., 1993; Velicer et al., 1995). While Velicer et al. (1995)
suggest that approximately 80 percent of smokers are in the
first two stages of readiness to quit, findings from this anal-
ysis indicate that about 93 percent of current smokers are in
the Precontemplation or Contemplation stages. Therefore,
with the majority of current smokers in the Precontempla-
tion stage, a strong emphasis still is needed to raise the
awareness among smokers of all ages that their behavior
presents a serious threat to their health and to move them to
higher stages of readiness to quit. If the nation is to achieve
the Year 2000 goal of reducing the smoking prevalence to
no more than 15 percent among people aged 20 and older
(National Center for Health Statistics, 1994), it is essential
that many more smokers become motivated to move out of
the Precontemplation stage of readiness to quit. As our find-
ings indicate, only about 7 percent of the total population of
current smokers is in the Preparation stage and is ready to
move into the Action stage. This means that changes are
necessary in many current smoking cessation programs that
are targeted primarily at moving smokers into the Action
stage.
Age Differences in Readiness To Quit Smoking
As suggested by Biener and Abrams (1991), it is impor-
tant to distinguish between two levels of readiness to quit
SMOKING CESSATION S219
smoking: "readiness to consider quitting" and "readiness to
make a quit attempt." We found a significant difference by
age in readiness to consider quitting, with smokers age 30
to 49 more likely than younger and older smokers to be in
the Contemplation stage relative to the Precontemplation
stage. However, we found no differences by age in the per-
centage of smokers prepared to make a quit attempt com-
pared to those in Precontemplation and Contemplation.
These results are slightly different from those reported by
other studies. Velicer et al. (1995) reported stability in the
stage distributions across age, while Kviz et al. (1994)
found that smokers age 49 and younger were more likely to
be considering quitting while those 50 and older were more
likely to be ready to make a quit attempt. Neither of these
previous studies analyzed national samples. Also, Kviz and
colleagues did not use the operational definitions of stages
that were used for these analyses.
We also found important age-related differences in the
significant covariates of readiness to quit. These findings
suggest that the effectiveness of stage-matched interven-
tions might be enhanced by including age-sensitive recruit-
ment strategies and program content (Rimer and Orleans,
1994; Rimer et al., 1994). The biggest challenge for health
promotion appears to be among smokers age 50 and older.
Similar to results reported by Kviz and colleagues (1994),
we found that older smokers had perceptions about the
effects of smoking cigarettes that were least favorable to
being ready to quit. While the oldest smokers were least
likely to perceive smoking as addictive, recognizing smok-
ing as an addiction was a correlate of readiness to quit
among older adults but not younger ones. Similarly, while
we found that perceiving serious health problems from
smoking was associated with readiness to quit among the
oldest smokers, they were least likely to perceive that there
is a strong likelihood of serious health problems from
smoking and that smoking affects their health now.
Using data from the Adult Use of Tobacco Survey,
Orleans and colleagues (1994) also found a consistent dif-
ference between smokers aged 21^49 and those aged 50-74
in the recognition or acceptance of smoking health harms.
Compared to younger adults, older adults both underesti-
mated the risks of smoking and perceived more benefits of
smoking. Furthermore, results from other studies have
shown that older smokers, who have survived smoking-
related health threats and still smoke despite unavoidable
public health messages, may deny or suppress awareness of
smoking-related symptoms (Orleans et al., 1991; Rimer et
al., 1990). While we found that agreeing with statements
about the harms of smoking was positively associated with
readiness to quit for all smokers, this association was weak-
est among smokers 50 years of age or older. Therefore,
while interventions should reinforce both the immediate
and long-term health harms of smoking among smokers of
all ages, more emphasis about the consequences of smok-
ing and benefits of quitting are needed for older adults.
Finally, we found that, unlike younger age groups, older
adults who smoked one or more packs of cigarettes per day
were less likely to be ready to quit despite the fact that they
are at high risk for adverse health effects associated with
smoking. Therefore, special strategies should also be con-
sidered for heavier, long-term smokers among the oldest
age group.
There were similar correlates of readiness to quit among
smokers aged 30 to 49 and the oldest smokers, suggesting
that some comparable intervention strategies may be
employed for these smokers. Among smokers aged 30 to 49
and 50 and older, motivational strategies should be consid-
ered for long-term smokers, who were less likely to be
ready to quit smoking than those who had smoked for a
smaller percentage of their lifetime. These motivational
messages should take into account the habituation of the
behavior as well as a potential lack of confidence in the
ability to stop smoking as a result of prior failed quit
attempts. One promising strategy for delivering smoking
cessation information and materials is through advice from
health professionals in clinical settings. Smokers who had
been advised to quit by a medical doctor in the past year
were more likely than those without a medical visit to be in
higher stages of readiness to quit. Health care providers
should especially emphasize the health consequences of
smoking, as we found that those who perceived that smok-
ing affected their current health status and would likely
cause serious health problems in the future were in higher
stages of readiness to quit.
Although they shared some similar correlates of readi-
ness to quit with older smokers, established smokers ages
30 to 49 had attitudes more favorable to being ready to try
to quit smoking. Furthermore, they were more likely than
the youngest and oldest smokers to be contemplating quit-
ting. However, they were no more likely than other age
groups to be preparing to take action. Therefore, interven-
tions should focus on moving them from Contemplation to
Preparation. Furthermore, unlike the other age groups, edu-
cational level was positively associated with readiness to
quit among smokers 30 to 49. Therefore, special strategies
should be considered for less educated smokers in this age
group, who were less likely than those with education
beyond high school to be in higher stages of readiness
to quit.
We also found that, unlike other age groups, smokers
aged 30 to 49 who reported being very annoyed by smoke
from other people's cigarettes were in higher stages of
readiness to quit. This suggests that for a relatively small
group of smokers, despite years of their own smoking,
becoming personally affected by smoke from other people's
cigarettes is an important motivator for preparing to take
action. Future studies should examine triggers of this
annoyance and how realization of the nuisance of exposure
to passive smoke can be used to motivate current smokers
to make an attempt to quit.
Among smokers 18 to 29 years, the only other significant
correlate of readiness to quit smoking was race. Non-
Whites were slightly more likely to be in higher stages of
readiness to quit. While in bivariate analyses we found that
the youngest smokers had attitudes and smoking behaviors
most favorable to being ready to quit, our multivariate anal-
ysis did not provide insight as to how to assist younger
adults in preparing to quit smoking. In a study using com-
parable age categories, Kviz et al. (1994) found that per-
ceived desire, determination, and confidence in ability to
S220 CLARK ETAL.
quit were associated with readiness to quit smoking among
younger adults. Unfortunately, measures of these variables
were not available in the NHIS-CCS. Therefore, this should
be explored in future studies using national samples of
smokers.
Future Directions
Caution is necessary when interpreting findings from
comparisons of age groups regarding a habitual and addic-
tive behavior such as smoking (Hall, Tunstall, & Rugg,
1984). Some of our findings might be explained by a cohort
effect, related to differences in the nature and amount of
information about smoking and quitting to which smokers
were exposed during the time they were smoking. Also,
findings from the oldest group may have been influenced
by selection effects. The smokers in that age cohort who
were most likely to quit smoking already may have quit at a
younger age. Thus, current older smokers may be those
who were least motivated or least able to stop smoking.
Also, members of the older cohort who were most suscepti-
ble to smoking-related morbidity and mortality were less
likely to have been included in the sample because they
died or were too ill to participate. Therefore, future research
should include longitudinal and trend studies to distinguish
the attitudinal shifts which occur as a result of maturation
from changes in secular trends or generation effects.
In this study, we used a broad age range for the oldest
age group 4ue to the lower smoking prevalence among
smokers age 65 and older as well as a desire to compare our
results with other studies. However, this resulted in a het-
erogeneous group of older adults. For example, adults 50 to
64 may be more affected by workplace smoking policies
and influential household members while the current cohort
of smokers 65 and older may be strongly influenced by fre-
quent contact with health care settings due to negative
health effects related to life-long smoking habits. There-
fore, future studies should include sufficient numbers of
elderly smokers in order to conduct age-specific analyses
within the cohort of smokers 50 years and older.
Power to identify differences between the three age
groups we analyzed was restricted by the unequal distribu-
tion of cases by age, in that almost half of the total sample
were in the 30 to 49 age group. Also, with the smaller num-
ber of cases in the 18 to 29 and 50 or older groups, we did
not have the same power to identify significant correlates of
readiness to quit within those age groups as for the 30 to 49
group. Therefore, future studies should recruit sufficient
numbers of younger as well as older adults in order to have
comparable samples of smokers across the life span.
Findings from this analysis are an important addition to
the limited age-related research about smoking cessation
and show that there are age differences in factors associated
with stages of readiness to quit smoking. These results sup-
port other studies of age differences in readiness to quit
(Kviz et al., 1994; Orleans et al., 1991; Rimer et al., 1990).
Age differences should be considered routinely when plan-
ning, implementing, and evaluating smoking cessation
interventions. In addition to matching interventions to a
smoker's stage in the smoking cessation process, our find-
ings suggest that the effectiveness of smoking cessation
programs might be improved by including age-sensitive
recruitment strategies, program content, and modes of
delivery.
