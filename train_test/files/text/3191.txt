Research Question
According to the textbook theory, greater financial market integration improves portfolio
diversification and facilitates the channeling of funds towards the more productive projects,
thereby promoting better risk sharing and faster economic convergence across regions. This
traditional view on the macroeconomic effects of financial integration has been however
significantly relativized in recent times. Indeed, as the recent 2007-08 global crisis and the
boom and bust cycles in some European countries have shown, an increased financial
integration may have destabilizing effects on the macroeconomy through the facilitation of
excessive cross-border private and public borrowing. In this context, the following question
arises: What are the macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking under different
lending standards in a monetary union such as the European Monetary Union?
Contribution
Our main contribution is to investigate the role of cross-border bank credit flows in a two-
region monetary union by incorporating a banking sector in an otherwise standard two-
country macroeconomic model. As the main contribution of the paper, we evaluate the
macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking under different lending standards.
This is modeled by letting the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of firms as a
measure of their creditworthiness depend on either regional productivity shocks, or on the
productivity shock from one dominating region.
Results
In a nutshell, our simulation results highlight the role of cross-border lending not only as an
amplifying mechanism within a monetary union, but also as a potential source of
macroeconomic instability in the presence of asymmetric information. More precisely, while
cross-border lending amplifies the effects of exogenous shocks in all three considered
scenarios, in the latter one ­ where there is a dominant region which implicitly determines
the lending standards for the whole monetary union ­ cross-border lending also leads to the
occurrence of business fluctuations driven purely by laxer credit conditions, and not by
macroeconomic fundamentals. Hence, the financial sector may work to exacerbate the
emergence of macroeconomic imbalances in a monetary union if banks assign lending
standards from one dominating region to the whole monetary union. Analyzing possibilities
for monetary policy against this scenario, we find that a standard inflation targeting
monetary policy rule augmented by a loan spread target may be beneficial for reducing the
volatility of macroeconomic variables.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Forschungsfrage
In der Wirtschaftstheorie führt eine stärkere Integration der Finanzmärkte zur einer
größeren Portfoliodiversifizierung und fördert die Kanalisierung von Mitteln in produktivere
Anlagen. Hieraus folgt eine bessere Risikoverteilung und eine raschere wirtschaftliche
Konvergenz der einzelnen Regionen. Diese traditionelle Sicht der makroökonomischen
Effekte der Finanzintegration wurde allerdings in letzter Zeit stark relativiert. So haben etwa
die globale Krise der Jahre 2007-2008 und die Hausse-Baisse-Zyklen in einigen europäischen
Ländern gezeigt, dass sich eine tiefere Integration der Finanzmärkte destabilisierend auf die
Gesamtwirtschaft auswirken kann, da sie eine übermäßige grenzüberschreitende
Kreditaufnahme des privaten und öffentlichen Sektors ermöglicht. Vor diesem Hintergrund
stellt sich folgende Frage: Welche gesamtwirtschaftlichen Folgen ergeben sich aus dem
grenzüberschreitenden Bankgeschäft mit unterschiedlichen Kreditvergabestandards in einer
Währungsunion wie der EWU?
Beitrag
Unser Hauptbeitrag besteht darin, die Rolle grenzüberschreitender Bankkreditströme in
einer zwei Regionen umfassenden Währungsunion zu untersuchen, indem wir einen
Bankensektor in ein ansonsten standardisiertes makroökonomisches Zwei-Länder-Modell
integrieren. Als wichtigsten Bestandteil unseres Forschungspapiers analysieren wir die
makroökonomischen Konsequenzen grenzüberschreitender bankgeschäftlicher Tätigkeit vor
dem Hintergrund unterschiedlicher Kreditrichtlinien. Im Modell dargestellt wird dies, indem
wir die Beleihungsgrenze, die die Banken als Bonitätsmaßstab an die Unternehmen anlegen,
entweder von regionalen Produktivitätsschocks oder vom Produktivitätsschock einer
dominierenden Region abhängig machen.
Ergebnisse
Auf den Punkt gebracht bestätigen unsere Simulationsergebnisse nicht nur die Rolle der
grenzüberschreitenden Kreditvergabe als Verstärkungsmechanismus in einer
Währungsunion, sondern auch als potenzielle Ursache für gesamtwirtschaftliche Instabilität
angesichts von Informationsasymmetrien. Konkret bedeutet dies, dass die
grenzüberschreitende Kreditvergabe in allen drei untersuchten Szenarien zwar die Effekte
exogener Schocks verstärkt, doch im letztgenannten Fall ­ wenn also eine dominante Region
implizit die Kreditstandards in der gesamten Währungsunion bestimmt ­ außerdem zu
Wirtschaftsschwankungen führt, die allein durch die laxeren Kreditkonditionen und nicht
durch makroökonomische Fundamentaldaten begründet sind. Somit kann der Finanzsektor
das Auftreten makroökonomischer Ungleichgewichte in einer Währungsunion verstärken,
wenn die Banken die Anwendung der Kreditrichtlinien einer dominierenden Region auf die
gesamte Währungsunion übertragen. Die Analyse der geldpolitischen Optionen, mit denen
diesem Szenario begegnet werden kann, zeigt, dass eine geldpolitische Standardregel auf
Basis eines Inflationsziels, erweitert um ein Kreditspreadziel, dazu beitragen kann, die
Volatilität der makroökonomischen Variablen zu verringern.

Abstract
Against the background of the recent housing boom and bust in countries such as Spain and
Ireland, we investigate in this paper the macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking in
monetary unions such as the euro area. For this purpose, we incorporate in an otherwise standard
two-region monetary union DSGE model a banking sector module along the lines of Gerali et al.
(2010), accounting for borrowing constraints of entrepreneurs and an internal constraint on the
bank's leverage ratio. We illustrate in particular how different lending standards within the
monetary union can translate into destabilizing spill-over effects between the regions, which can
in turn result in a higher macroeconomic volatility. This mechanism is modeled by letting the loan-
to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs depend on either regional productivity
shocks or on the productivity shock from one dominating region. Thereby, we demonstrate a
channel through which the financial sector may have exacerbated the emergence of macroeconomic
imbalances within the euro area. Additionally, we show the effects of a monetary policy rule
augmented by the loan rate spread as in Cúrdia and Woodford (2010) in a two-country monetary
union context.

Bundesbank Discussion Paper No 21/2015
1 Introduction
One of the central features of the European monetary unification process has been the steady inte-
gration of financial markets across the European Monetary Union (EMU) over the last three decades,
which was embedded in an unprecedented financial globalization process (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti,
2007, European Commission, 2008, ECB, 2010). According to the textbook theory, more integrated
financial markets improve portfolio diversification and facilitate the channeling of funds towards
the more productive projects, thereby promoting better risk sharing and faster economic conver-
gence across regions (Barro et al., 1995). However, the traditional view on financial globalization
has been significantly relativized since the 2007 global financial crisis (see e.g. Kose et al., 2009 for
a critical review). An alternative view stresses the importance of a potential link between finan-
cial integration and the emergence of financial bubbles and, thus, macroeconomic instability due
to overly optimistic growth expectations and excessive cross-border private and public borrowing
(Blanchard and Milesi-Ferretti, 2010 and Jaumotte and Sodsriwiboon, 2010).
The increased financial integration among euro area countries, driven by the elimination of currency
risk, a fall in real interest rates in Southern European economies and the general economic integration,
led to a surge in cross-border financial flows as shown in Figure 1. Given the well-known predominance
of the banking sector in the European financial landscape, the expansion in cross-border financial
activities took place primarily in the form of bank-related capital flows (BIS, 2010; Kleimeier et al.,
2013). While initially economic convergence processes within EMU seemed to be related to the
increase in financial integration, cross-border banking was also a driving factor for the credit booms
and housing bubbles in some European countries such as Spain and Ireland, and thereby contributed
to the build-up of intra-Eurozone current account imbalances (see e.g. Allen et al., 2011 and BIS,
2011).
Against this background, we investigate in this paper the role of cross-border bank credit flows in
a two-region monetary union by incorporating a banking sector in an otherwise standard two-country
DSGE framework. As the main contribution of the paper, we evaluate the macroeconomic conse-
quences of cross-border banking under different lending standards. This is modelled by letting the
loan-to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of firms as a measure of their creditworthiness depend
on either regional productivity shocks, or on the productivity shock from one dominating region. The
latter scenario, which we term rule-of-thumb banking, may capture the effect of interest rate conver-
gence within EMU shown in Figure 1, where the elimination of currency risk effectively led financial
markets to apply the low risk standards of the largest European economies throughout the whole
monetary union. Our model thus allows to evaluate the role of the financial sector for the transmis-
sion and amplification of shocks throughout the monetary union. Following Gerali et al. (2010) and
Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), the banking sector is assumed to consist of an international whole-
sale branch, which underlies an exogenous constraint on the target leverage ratio, and regional retail

branches providing credit to entrepreneurs and collecting deposits from households. As in Iacoviello
(2005), entrepreneurs are subject to a financial constraint where credit is awarded relative to their net
worth, weighted with banks' desired LTV ratio as a measure for firms' creditworthiness.
Calibrating the model to the euro area, we first analyze the effect of a common monetary policy
shock. Second, the nature of cross-border banking and trading flows in a monetary union with different
LTV-based credit standards is evaluated. In the baseline scenario, bank's desired LTV ratio of firms
is assumed to be constant and equal across regions. The baseline scenario may thus be regarded
as capturing the case with symmetric information regarding firms' net worth in both regions. In the
second scenario, the parameter follows an AR(1) process driven by regional-specific technology shocks.
Thereby, a positive technology shock not only affects firms' net worth directly, but also serves as a
signal for banks' assessment of firms' creditworthiness. Hence, in this scenario banks are assumed
to suffer from asymmetric information which they attempt to recover using the technology shock as
a signal. The effect of the shock on bank lending is amplified, and via the trade links between the
regions, the whole monetary union is affected. In the third scenario, we assume that there exists
one dominating region providing the signal for credit worthiness. This scenario may be regarded as
capturing convergence in short-run interest rates across EMU countries with the introduction of the
common currency. Notably, macroeconomic volatility is highest in the third scenario.
In a nutshell, our simulation results highlight the role of cross-border lending not only as an
amplifying mechanism within a monetary union, but also as a potential source of macroeconomic
instability in the presence of asymmetric information. More precisely, while cross-border lending
amplifies the effects of exogenous shocks in all three considered scenarios, in the latter one ­ where
there is a dominant region which implicitly determines the lending standards for the whole monetary
2
union ­ cross-border lending also leads to the occurrence of business fluctuations driven purely by
laxer credit conditions, and not by macroeconomic fundamentals. Hence, the financial sector may
work to exacerbate the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances in a monetary union if banks assign
lending standards from one dominating region to the whole monetary union. Analyzing possibilities
for monetary policy against this scenario, we find that a standard inflation targeting monetary policy
rule augmented by an intermediate loan spread target may be beneficial for reducing the volatility
of macroeconomic variables, an argument along the lines of the proposals by Cúrdia and Woodford
(2010) and, more recently, Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014).
In modern DSGE models, the financial sector has only more recently received more attention.
While models accounting for a financial accelerator as in Bernanke et al. (1999) or Iacoviello (2005) are
now relatively common, most models do not feature a detailed banking sector. Recently, Gerali et al.
(2010) set up a DSGE model with an imperfectly competitive banking sector subject to an internal
leverage constraint and entrepreneurs facing a borrowing constraint. Estimating the model on euro
area data, the authors report that shocks originating in the banking sector explain the largest share
of the contraction of economic activity in 2008, while macroeconomic shocks play only a limited
role. A similar result is obtained in Kollmann et al. (2011) in an estimated two-country model for
the US and the euro area. In a simplified version of this model, Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014)
analyse whether monetary policy should also target asset prices or credit in the presence of borrowing
constraints on firms' side and a banking sector with a credit supply constraint. They show that
leaning-against-the-wind policies by the central bank in reaction to supply side shocks allow for a better
trade-off between output and inflation stabilization. Hence, the authors reinforce the results obtained
by Cúrdia and Woodford (2010) in a much simpler model with exogenously introduced interest rate
spreads. We extend the analysis in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) by
evaluating the effect of borrowing and credit supply constraints in a two-region model of a monetary
union, allowing us to focus on spill-over effects of banking related shocks between the regions.
Moreover, our paper is related to the three-country New Keynesian model analyzed in in 't Veld et al.
(2014), which also focuses on the emergence of international capital flows in a monetary union like
the euro area. Specifically, in 't Veld et al. (2014) identify the following determinants for the recent
boom-bust cycle in Spain: a) falling risk premia on Spanish housing and non-residential capital, b)
a loosening of collateral constraints for Spanish households and firms, and c) a fall in the interest
rate spread between Spain and the rest of the euro area. Their approach differs from ours in that we
model cross-border lending in an explicit manner through the specification of an international bank
with loan retail branches at the national level, and analyze the effects of changes in banks' assessment
of firms' credit-worthiness across the monetary union.
Finally, our approach is more broadly related to other two-region DSGE models of a monetary
union, such as Benigno (2004), Gali and Monacelli (2008), Beetsma and Jensen (2005), Duarte and Wolman
3
(2008), Ferrero (2009) and Engler et al. (2013). While the former three papers evaluate optimal mon-
etary and fiscal policy rules in a monetary union, the latter three papers focus more specifically on
problems related with fiscal policy in a monetary union, such as possibilities to improve inflation
differentials with fiscal policy, or to use fiscal devaluation to counteract macroeconomic imbalances.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we set up a two-region DSGE
model of a monetary union with a cross-border banking sector consisting of an international wholesale
branch and region-specific retail branches as in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti
(2014). In section 3 we discuss the properties of the resulting theoretical framework, and analyze
the dynamic adjustments of the model's main variables to unexpected monetary policy and cost-push
shocks, as well as the consequences of alternative specifications of the lending standards by the banking
sector. In section 4 we investigate the design of monetary policy in such an environment. Finally, we
draw some concluding remarks in section 5.
2 The Model
We consider a two-region monetary union populated by a continuum of agents on the interval [0, 1],
a segment [0, n] residing in a region labeled H(ome), and the other segment living in the other region
labeled F(oreign). We assume that Home is the risky region (the South, for the sake of illustration),
and Foreign is the safe-haven region (the North, for the sake of illustration). There is no labor mobility
between the regions. Both regions are assumed to produce tradable consumption goods, which are
considered to be imperfect substitutes due to a standard home bias argument.1 Since we model a
monetary union, the nominal exchange rate between the regions is constant and may be normalised
to one.
2.1 Households
Households in both regions are infinitely-lived and have identical preferences and endowments within
each region. Further, as in Iacoviello (2005) households are assumed to be more patient than en-
trepreneurs, that is, that they have a lower discount factor ( < E
). As a result, households
purchase a certain amount of new deposit contracts and entrepreneurs borrow a positive amount of
loans in equilibrium. In other words, in equilibrium positive financial flows exist with households
being net lenders and entrepreneurs being net borrowers. In order to render the model stationary, we
follow Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2003) and assume that households face a small quadratic portfolio
adjustment cost D when their deposits differ from the steady-state level D.

intertemporal utility, which we assume to be separable in consumption and leisure. Households in
both Home and Foreign save in the form of bank deposits, earning a uniform deposit rate rd
t
which
for the sake of simplicity is assumed to be equal to the short-term interest rate controlled by the
monetary authority of the currency union.

Following Duarte and Wolman (2008) and Ferrero (2009), the aggregate consumption bundle in
Home (analogous expressions hold for Foreign) contains region-specific goods bundles from both
regions and is defined as

where Ch
t
and Cf
t
represent bundles of retail consumption goods i produced in Home and Foreign,
respectively,  denotes the elasticity of substitution between these two consumption bundles and the
5
parameter H represents the steady-state import share of households in H. Given our assumption of
home bias in consumption, it holds that H < (1 - n).2
Next, we determine the optimal allocation of total consumption expenditures of the representative
household across the regional good bundles Ch
t
and Cf
t
. This is derived from the point of view of a
household in H here, where analogous relations apply for households in F. Assuming that the law of
one price (LOP) holds, the price for identical bundles of goods will be the same in both regions. For
instance, Ph
t
= St
Ph
t
, where Ph
t
is the price of goods produced in H in terms of foreign currency
and St
is the nominal exchange rate. Since we model a monetary union, the nominal exchange rate is
fixed at one and LOP implies Ph
t
= Ph
t
and Pf
t
= Pf
t
.
Households in region H first allocate consumption across individual retail goods, and then optimally
choose how to allocation consumption across bundles produced in region H and F. We assume that
region-specific bundles of retail goods i, produced in H and in F, are packed into consumption bundles
Ch
t
and Cf
t
with the usual CES functions, adjusted for region size, where n is the size of region H, (1-n)

2Note that the assumption of a symmetric steady state with equal per-capita output in the two regions implies that
the amount of home bias in both regions is related to the relative region size: F = n

H .
3When using consumers' demand functions to derive total demand for retailers' individual goods, we model the
elasticity of substitution as a region-specific exogenous shock process. Thereby, a cost-push shock on retailers' mark-
up may be introduced. To keep the model simple, we omit this assumption here and simply treat the elasticity of
substitution as a parameter.

denotes the CPI price index for region H. Given
the assumed home bias in consumption, the households' aggregate consumption bundles in Home and
Foreign and the corresponding price indices are not necessarily symmetric. In order to get rid of

2.2 Firms
We assume that production takes place in two stages. In the first stage, firms in region H and firms
in region F produce the intermediate good Y h,int
t
and Y f,int
t
in fully competitive markets and under
credit constraints as in Iacoviello (2005). In line with Bernanke et al. (1999), we then assume that
intermediate goods are sold to retailers, who take their price as given and differentiate them at no
cost. Due to the differentiation of products, retailers are assumed to operate under monopolistic
competition and face a quadratic cost for the adjustment of prices as in Rotemberg (1982). All profits
from retail activities are rebated lump-sum to households in the respective region.
2.2.1 Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs in regions H and F produce intermediate goods Y h,int
t
and Y f,int
t
under perfect compe-
tition. Intermediate goods are used in the production of a final consumption good and are assumed to
be non-tradable. Entrepreneurs aim at maximizing their consumption and use capital goods and labor
7
for the production of intermediate goods. We assume that entrepreneurs consume only goods from
their own region. At the end of each period, entrepreneurs buy new capital goods from capital produc-
ers, so that capital is only realized in the next period. Investment into new capital goods is assumed
to be financed with loans from banks.4 Following Iacoviello (2005), we assume that entrepreneurs are
credit-constrained and thus can only borrow up to a fraction of their collateral, i.e. their capital assets.
The resulting dynamics are similar to a financial accelerator effect as in Bernanke et al. (1999). Note
that our assumption of a lower discount factor for firms ensures that the borrowing constraint will
always bind in the neighbourhood of the steady-state.
Entrepreneurs in H thus maximize consumption CEH
t
subject to their budget and their borrowing
constraints and to a Cobb-Douglas constant-returns-to-scale production function:

the mark-up of retail over intermediate goods prices (we assume that the mark-up is the same in
both regions), KEH
t
is capital obtained at the price qkH
t
and depreciated with rate k. Entrepreneurs'
discount factor E
is assumed to be lower than households' , so that entrepreneurs are always net
borrowers.
The borrowing constraint in (21) states that loans cannot exceed a fraction mE of the real de-
preciated value of capital assets in relation to the interest obligations. The parameter mE may be
interpreted as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs and, thus, gives a
measure of banks' assessment regarding firms' credit-worthiness. We assume that mE may vary across
regions in the monetary union, reflecting different macroeconomic conditions and different assessments
of firms' credit-worthiness by banks. While the baseline simulation assumes symmetric borrowing con-
straints in both regions, in section 3.4 we assume that the borrowing constraint parameter is either
affected by the region's own technology shock, or banks may perceive one region's technology shock
as dominant and apply restrictions to borrowing constraints in both regions.
4This seems to be a reasonable assumption for a model of the EMU, since bank credit is the predominant source of
external finance for European firms, see for instance Allen et al. (2011).

Finally, the Cobb-Douglas production function gives output as a function of capital and labour
inputs, where AH
t
is an exogenous technology process which may differ across regions. We define AH
t
as an exogenous AR(1) process with persistence parameter a
and i.i.d. shock process AH
t
. Defining
the real return of capital as RkH
t
 AH

(KEH

we then get the following optimality

Equation (23) gives entrepreneurs' Euler equation, where sB
t
denotes the Lagrange multiplier on
the borrowing constraint and thus gives the marginal value of one unit of borrowing. The relation
in (24) gives the optimal relation between entrepreneurs' consumption and real returns from capital,
given the borrowing constraint. Finally, equation (25) shows that in the optimum, real wages equal
the marginal product of labor. Analogous optimality conditions hold for entrepreneurs in region F.
2.2.2 Capital producers
As in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), we assume that each period, cap-
ital production is undertaken by perfectly competitive capital producers, which are owned by en-
trepreneurs. These firms buy last period's depreciated capital stock from entrepreneurs as well as an
investment It
in the form of new final goods from retailers and use both to produce the new capital
stock. In line with previous authors, we assume that old capital stock can be transformed one-for-one
into new capital stock, while investment from final goods underlies a quadratic adjustment cost for
the transformation into capital goods. At the end of the period, the resulting new capital stock is
sold back to entrepreneurs. Since capital goods production takes place within each region, we only
describe the problem for capital goods producers in H, but analogous relations hold also in F:
Defining xH

2.2.3 Retailers
Retailers in regions H and F buy intermediate goods Y h,int
t
or Y f,int
t
from entrepreneurs in a com-
petitive market, taking their price Ph,int
t
or Pf,int
t
as given. These intermediate goods are then
differentiated into final consumption goods at no cost, so that retailers operate under monopolistic
competition. Additionally, they are assumed to face quadratic costs for the adjustment of prices as in
Rotemberg (1982). In our two-region model, retailers are symmetric, but face demand from consumers
in both regions as well as from domestic entrepreneurs.
Aggregating over households and entrepreneurs, world demand for individual retail goods for retail-
ers in H is then derived from the demand equations of households and from entrepreneurs, measured
in units per domestic firm. Note that we model the elasticity of substitution for individual goods
produced in H as a region-specific exogenous process H
t
. This gives the demand for individual good
Y h

Finally, the exogenous process for the elasticity of substitution is related to retailers' mark-up mkH

in region H via the relation mkH

/(H

- 1). We model retailers' region-specific mark-up as an
AR(1) process with persistence mk
and an i.i.d. cost-push shock Y H
t
.
2.3 The Banking Sector
For our model of cross-border banking within a monetary union, we build on the work of Gerali et al.
(2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014). The two papers present DSGE models with both
a collateral channel from entrepreneurs' credit constraint à la Iacoviello (2005) and a credit-supply
channel stemming from a target for banks' leverage ratio, which may limit the supply of credit available
from banks. We follow this approach and adjust the set-up of banks in the model to allow for cross-
border credit flows.
Specifically, we assume that there exists a representative bank in the monetary union, which con-
sists of an international wholesale branch and national retail branches in each region of the monetary
union. The wholesale branch is responsible for collecting deposits from households throughout the
monetary union and distributes the resulting funds to the retail branches at the internal loan rates
RbH and RbF . The retail branches then provide credit to entrepreneurs in their region of residence.
Note that in this set-up, banks cannot endogenously create new credit. The wholesale branch is ad-
ditionally responsible for adhering to the exogenous constraint on the bank's leverage ratio, which is
modelled in the form of a quadratic cost of deviating from the target value . The value of  could
for instance be interpreted as reflecting regulatory legislation regarding banks' equity holdings. The
credit-supply channel thus introduces an additional feedback loop between real and financial condi-
tions in the sense that the loan rates, as well as the spread between the loan rates and the risk-free
policy rate, depends on banks' leverage, their profit and, hence, on macroeconomic conditions. Finally,
retail branches in H, F are assumed to operate under monopolistically competitive conditions, and
thus charge a constant mark-up µb on the internal loan rate RbH, i.e. RbF .
Aggregate deposits in the monetary union and aggregate lending to entrepreneurs in both regions
are defined as follows:
Dt
 nDH
t
+ (1 - n)DF
t
(33)
Bt
 n 1
 BH
t
-1
 + (1 - n) 1
 BF
t
-1


-1
(34)
where BH
t
and BH
t
denote the credit supply given to retail branches in region H and F, respectively,
and  denotes the bank's elasticity of substitution between lending to both regions. We thus assume
11
that loans to the two regions are imperfect substitutes from the point of view of the bank, which may
be motivated with the notion of a historically more sound economic performance in one region (here
the North), as well as with differences in the credit screening capabilities in both regions. Note that
we assume no home bias in lending, because the wholesale bank is assumed to be international. In our
set-up, the wholesale branch thus aims at maximizing profits subject to a quadratic cost for deviating
from their target leverage ratio  and to their budget constraint:

 BF

, (37)
where Kb
t
is the banks' own capital and the parameter  gives the proportion of Kb
t
to which the cost
of deviating from target applies. The bank's leverage ratio and its budget constraint are determined
with respect to aggregate lending Bt
. Solving the maximization problem gives the internal loan rates
for credit supply to retail branches in regions H and F:

(39)
Hence, extending the closed economy set-up in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) to the open
economy case, it turns out that both the effect of the risk-free deposit rate and of the leverage
constraint on the loan rate are weighted with the relative share of loan supply to the respective
region, adjusted for region size. This means that loan rates in a given region will be more sensitive to
deviations from the bank's leverage target and to changes in the policy rate if the wholesale branch
distributes a larger share of its overall credit supply to this region.
As in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), the retail banks are then assumed to be able to differenti-
ate the wholesale loans at no costs and pass them under monopolistic competition on to entrepreneurs,
charging a constant mark-up µb, which we assume to be equal across regions in the monetary union:5
rbH
t
= RbH
t
+ µb (40)
rbF
t
= RbF
t
+ µb (41)
5This assumption implies that throughout the monetary union, the market structure among retail banks is similar.
Since we assume that the representative bank acts internationally in both regions of the monetary union, this assumption
seems reasonable.
12
Finally, we define aggregate banks' profits Jb
t
as the sum of wholesale and retail profits and assume
that banks re-invest their profits into new bank capital, where a fraction b is used each period to pay
for banking activities:

2.4 Monetary Policy
The central bank in the model controls the nominal risk-free interest rate rd
t
and adjusts to inflation
as in Bernanke et al. (1998). Since we model a currency union, the central bank targets inflation in
both regions, where the weight is given by their relative size. This results in the following Taylor-type
rule:
(1 + rd
t
) = (1 + rd
t-1
)(1 + ¯
rd)1- n H
t
+ (1 - n) F
t

1-

where  measures the amount of interest rate smoothing, ¯
rd the nominal steady state interest rate,

gives the strength of inflation targeting and rd
t
is an i.i.d. monetary policy shock.
2.5 Equilibrium
Equilibrium in our model is defined by the resource constraints and market clearing conditions in all
markets. These are given as follows for the goods market, the labor market and the banking sector,

3 Simulations
3.1 Calibration
For the following simulations we follow Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) and set our model param-
eters mainly as in Gerali et al. (2010), who calibrated their model so as to match key aspects of the
euro area real and financial sectors. Additionally, some parameters relating to the open-economy
aspect of the model are calibrated as in the two-region model of the euro area of Engler et al. (2013).
Table 1 reports all parameter values.6
Accordingly, households' discount factor P
is set at 0.996, which implies a steady-state policy
rate of about 2 % (annualized). Entrepreneurs' discount factor E
is set at 0.975, as in Iacoviello
(2005). The inverse of the Frisch elasticity  is set at 1 as in (Galí, 2008). The share of capital in
the aggregate production function  is set at 0.20, and the depreciation rate of physical capital (k)
at 0.05 as in Gerali et al. (2010). The elasticity of substitution across regional goods bundles  is
set at 2 as in Engler et al. (2013). Further, we set the adjustment cost for changing prices p
at the
value estimated by Gerali et al. (2010) for the euro area, namely 28.65. Concerning the investment
adjustment cost parameter I, we set it at 5 as in Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) in their analysis
of their model's response to technology shocks.7
The required LTV ratio for entrepreneurs set by the retail bank branches, mE, is set at 0.35 in
the baseline case, which is similar to the average ratio of long-term loans to the value of shares and
other equities for nonfinancial corporations in the euro area, see also Gerali et al. (2010) as well as
Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014). The target leverage ratio  and the cost for managing the bank
capital position b are set at 9% and 0.049, respectively, following again Gerali et al. (2010). Due to
the lack of a more direct measure, we set the bank capital adjustment cost  at 11, the value estimated
by Gerali et al. (2010). The bank's elasticity of substitution between loans to Home and Foreign, ,
is set equal to the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods bundles, , at 2. The
degree of monetary policy inertia is set at 0.77, and 
is set at 1.5, as it is standard in the literature.
We set the relative size of the Home and Foreign economies at 0.34 and 0.66, respectively, to
reflect the asymmetric economic size of the regions within the euro area, assuming for the sake of
illustration that Home represents the Southern euro area countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal or
Greece, and Foreign the Northern euro area countries, in particular Germany (see also Engler et al.,
2013). Finally, we set the variance of the technology and the cost-push shocks equal to 1 percent as
6We also considered estimating the current framework with disaggregated euro area data, but decided against it
because a proper estimation of the cross-border banking effects at work here would be a task beyond the scope of this
paper, due to their overlap with the global financial liberalization since the 2000s. We leave this for further research.
7Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) set I at 0.5 when analyzing cost-push shocks, but argue that when both tech-
nology and cost-push shocks hit their model at the same time, their overall results are not affected by the choice of a
particular value of I , see Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014, p.155-56).

3.2 Monetary policy shock
In order to illustrate the different mechanism at work in the present framework, in the following we
discuss the dynamic adjustments of the model's endogenous variables to an unexpected contractionary
shock on the policy rate of the monetary union's central bank.

Figure 2: Dynamic adjustments after a union-wide monetary policy shock. All rates are shown
as absolute deviations from steady state, expressed in percentage points. All other variables are
percentage deviations from their respective steady state levels.
As summarized in Figure 2, the unexpected increase in the policy rate of the monetary union's
central bank affects both economies through a variety of channels. First, a contractionary shock to
the policy rate rt
leads to an increase in the internal rate of interest between the wholesale and the
region-specific retail bank branches, and thus by extension also to an increase in the loan interest rates
RbH and RbF offered to the entrepreneurs by the retail bank branches in the Southern and Northern
regions, respectively. This pass-through effect from rt
to RbH and RbF is larger than one, as the rise
in the spread between the loan rate in both regions and the policy interest rate clearly illustrates. At
this point it is noteworthy that despite the fact that the initial shock in the policy rate affects both
regions in an identical fashion, the reaction of loan interest rates, the loan spreads and by extension
16
the aggregate amount of awarded loans is, though qualitatively similar, quantitatively different in
both regions, with a larger effect on the spread in the Southern region. This rather unexpected result
arises from the different economic sizes assumed for both economic regions and the resulting different
relative shares of aggregate lending allocated to each region.8
The deterioration in the credit financing-conditions for firms leads to a decrease in the demand for
credit and thus in the amount of loans granted in equilibrium. This results in a reduction in the level
of aggregate investment and by extension in the capital accumulation in both economies, as illustrated
in Figure 2.
The increase in the policy rate leads of course also to a reduction in aggregate (both households'
and entrepreneurs') consumption ­ by their respective consumption Euler equations ­ which, jointly
with the reduction in aggregate investment, leads to an overall decrease in current aggregate output,
employment and wages. Note that the effect of the monetary policy shock on aggregate output is
very similar across both regions despite larger differences in the effect on investment. This is because
aggregate consumption in our model is a relatively larger part of output compared to investment.
The reduction in households' wage income causes a net reduction in their bank deposits despite the
increased opportunity costs related with the increase in the deposit rate (which is assumed to be equal
to the policy rate).
Finally, as expected the increase in the policy rate causes a fall in both retail and CPI inflation in
the two regions. Since the LOP assumption holds, inflation in both regions reacts symmetrically to
the shock, even though the level of inflation may differ.
Turning our attention back to the banking sector, the dynamic reactions of the wholesale bank's
profits JB
t
and capital Kb
t
illustrated in Figure 2 show clearly that while the reduction in the quantities
of both deposits and loans affects the international wholesale banking sector negatively, the net effect
of a policy rate increase is positive due to the larger increase in the internal and loan interest rates,
leading to an increase in the bank's profits and capital.
3.3 Cost-Push Shock
Next, we briefly discuss the dynamics resulting from an unexpected cost-push shock of one standard
deviation in the Northern region. Figure 3 summarizes the dynamics of the main variables of the
model.
As can be clearly observed, an unexpected asymmetric cost-push shock in the Northern region
leads to an immediate rise in both retail and CPI inflation in both regions, as well as to a relative
(though very small in absolute terms) improvement in the competitiveness position of the Northern
8Theoretically, if both regions were completely identical in their economic structure and had the same relative
economic size, i.e. n = 0.5, then the reactions would also be identical and no shift in relative prices would occur. This
is indeed corroborated by our model when n is set at 0.5.

as absolute deviations from steady state, expressed in percentage points. All other variables are
percentage deviations from their respective steady state levels.
economy. Note that since the LOP applies in our model, prices in both regions adjust symmetrically
to the cost-push shock in the Northern region, even though the level of CPI inflation may differ due
to the asymmetric region sizes. The standard countercyclical reaction of the monetary union's central
bank implies a rise in the policy rate sufficient to yield an increase in the real interest rate. Again,
this effect is amplified via the banking sector, as the increase in loan rate spreads in both regions
clearly illustrates. Note that the larger increase in the Southern regions' loan spread is again due to
the different region sizes.
However, in the case of a cost-push shock occurring only in one region, here the North, only the
Northern region's economy is adversely affected by the shock. This may be observed by the drop in
18
retail profits due to a fall in aggregate demand for retail goods produced in the Northern region (the
initial positive effect is because prices increase on impact, while demand is slower to adjust), leading
to a fall in agregate consumption, wages, investment and output. By contrast, retail profits in the
Southern region increase, yielding a boom in the region. Therefore, even though loan spreads increase
more in the Southern region, entrepreneurs from the South are awarded relatively more loans.
Finally, as in the case of a monetary policy shock, the banking sector profits relatively more from
the increase in loan spreads than from the drop in loans and deposits, so that overall banking profits
and capital increase.
3.4 Cross-Border Lending, Rule-of-Thumb Banking and Business Fluctuations
Here we investigate the implications of cross-border banking for macroeconomic activity. Indeed, as
previously discussed (see also CIEPR, 2012), the recent experience of the housing boom-and-bust
cycles in Spain and Ireland ­ which were financed to a large extent by cross-border capital flows
from Germany ­ seems to suggest that cross-border lending may not have been subject to the same
screening standards for credit worthiness as internal lending, and that this practice may have thus
contributed decisively to the recent macroeconomic instability of those countries.
In order to model this phenomenon in the most parsimonious manner, we assume in the following
that the LTV borrowing constraint for entrepreneurs, captured by the parameter mE, is not constant
as assumed in the previous sections, but that it follows a time-varying process driven by firms' region-
specific total factor productivity (TFP):
mE,k
t
= (1 + µAk
t-1
) mE, k = {H, F} (53)
where µ  1 is a proportionality factor, assumed here to equal 0.65. While this is of course a
convenient modeling shortcut, the rationale behind this specification is straightforward: In the real
world, banks usually employ a screening mechanism to assess the profitability of the investment
projects to be financed, and thus the creditworthiness of the loan applicants. To reflect this, we
assume that investment profitability is given solely by TFP. Under the assumption that TFP shocks
are observable also by the banking sector, it is natural to assume that a positive TFP shock leads
to a relaxation of the borrowing constraint imposed on the entrepreneurs by the banks. Obviously,
the determination of mE,k
t
would be region-specific in the normal case, with the retail bank branches
in Home and Foreign determining mEH
t
and mEF
t
according to the observation of AH
t-1
and AF
t-1
,
respectively. We refer to this normal case as scenario 1 in the following.
Alternatively, we consider an additional scenario where the lending standards in both countries
regions are determined uniformly solely on the observation of TFP in the Northern region, i.e.
19
mE,k
t
= (1 + µAF
t-1
)mE, k = {H, F}. (54)
This alternative specification of mE,k
t
solely as a function of AF
t-1
is meant to represent the rule-of-
thumb determination of lending standard in cross-border banking within the euro area discussed for
instance by Allen et al. (2011) and CIEPR (2012). In particular, this specification reflects the implicit
risk pooling associated with the establishment of monetary unions, and observable in the excessively
low sovereign risk premia of EMU countries and resulting interest rate convergence during the 2000s,
see e.g. De Grauwe and Ji (2012) and Proaño et al. (2014). We term this scenario rule-of-thumb
banking or scenario 2.
Figure 4 illustrates the dynamic adjustment of selected variables of our model under a constant
LTV borrowing constraint (baseline scenario), varying region-specific lending standards (scenario 1),
and rule-of-thumb lending standards (scenario 2). In all cases we assume a positive one-standard
deviation shock in TFP in the Northern region, AF
t
, leaving all other variables (and especially TFP
in the Southern region) unchanged, as the first two graphs in the first column of Figure 4 show.

As further shown in Figure 4, a positive shock to TFP in the North leads to an expansion in
aggregate income, consumption and investment in that region, the latter being partly financed by
an expansion of lending to the entrepreneurs by the banking sector over time. Note that this credit
expansion takes place also in the baseline case where mE,k = const., but is of course larger in magnitude
in the two alternative scenarios, where mE,k is a direct function of TFP in the Northern region. Due
to the higher aggregate income in the North, there is also a higher demand for goods produced
there which requires an expansion of the capital stock and thus in the production capabilities of the
region. This effect takes place in all three scenarios, but is of course largest in scenario 2, where the
LTV borrowing constraint (assumed to be a function of the observed TFP in the Northern region) is
relaxed not only in the Northern economy (where indeed an increase in TFP took place), but also in
the Southern region. As the graphs in the last row in Figure 4 show, aggregate economic activity in
both regions is significantly larger ­ particularly in the first periods after the shock ­ in scenarios 1
and 2 relative to the baseline scenario.
Analyzing the different effects on dynamic adjustments in the Southern economy in the different
scenarios allows to distinguish between spill-over effects via the trade linkages and the additional
effect of rule-of-thumb banking assumed in scenario 2. These emerge specifically with respect to loans
awarded to entrepreneurs and, thus, investment. As the South is awarded the same relaxation in
borrowing conditions than the North in scenario 2, both loans and investment increase more rapidly.
Finally, both aggregate consumption and output increase by more with time-varying LTV ratios,
although there are only marginal differences between scenario 1 and 2. Overall, the comparison
between scenarios 1 and 2 shows that with rule-of-thumb banking additional business cycle dynamics
occur in the Southern region, which are solely related to relaxations in credit availability, and not
backed by macroeconomic fundamentals.
Loan rate spreads decrease in both regions following the increase in loans awarded after the North-
ern TFP shock, whereas the effect is relatively larger in the Southern region. In both regions, the effect
becomes stronger over time as the bank adjusts the borrowing constraint to changes in productivity.
Since credit expands at the same time, we observe again that ­ as in the previously discussed cases of a
monetary policy or cost-push shock ­ price effects (in this case changes in loan rate spreads) dominate
over quantity effects (i.e. loans awarded), resulting here in a negative effect of the TFP shock on the
international wholesale bank's profits. Further, as it can be clearly observed in Figure 4, the reduction
in the bank's profits increases ceteris paribus the wholesale bank's leverage, as a higher quantity of
awarded loans goes hand in hand with lower profits and, by extension, lower bank capital, see eq. (43).
This result is particularly noteworthy as it implies that cross-border rule-of-thumb banking leads to
a higher leverage in the financial system, and thus to a more fragile macrofinancial situation.

the business cycle dynamics of the model, we report the theoretical first and second moments of the

As can be observed there, there is no significant variation in the theoretical means of the reported
variables across the three scenarios just analyzed, notable exceptions being the means of aggregate
investment IH
t
and IF
t
, the amount of loans awarded to the entrepreneurial sector BH
t
and BF
t
(and by
extension, Bb
t
), as well as the aggregate amount of households deposits Dt
, which feature a significant
increase due to a varying LTV constraint, either as determined by eq. (53) or by eq. (54). In other
words, a varying LTV constraint linked to the development of TFP in the entrepreneurial sector leads
to a larger amount of awarded loans and aggregate investment in both economies, and thus in the
monetary union.
This rather small level effect of the endogenization of the LTV ratio through eq. (53) and eq. (54)
at the macroeconomic level is, however, relativized when taking a look at the second moments of the
model's main variables. Indeed, as reported in the last three columns of Table 2, the volatility of
nearly all variables (the only exceptions being the real exchange rate RERt
and the terms-of trade
23
Tt
) is significantly larger in the two scenarios 1 and 2 in comparison to the baseline scenario, being
marginally larger in the second scenario in the great majority of cases.
Summing up, the numerical results discussed in this section suggest that cross-border lending
activities, especially with time-varying and potentially cycle-enhancing borrowing constraints, can
contribute to the magnification of macroeconomic fluctuations. This may eventually lead to sudden
busts as was the case in Spain and Ireland. Further, they highlight the need of a strict regulation
of the financial system and the lending standards, in particular given the perfect mobility of capital
within monetary unions such as the euro area.
Nonetheless, it could be possible that monetary policy could support such regulatory efforts by
the appropriate design of a monetary policy rule. Indeed, recent theoretical studies within the DSGE
modeling paradigm have shown that the incorporation of the banking sector ­ and the explicit modeling
of interest spreads ­ has important consequences for the design of monetary policy, see for instance
Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014). In the next section we thus address this question.
4 Is there a role for monetary policy in stabilizing the effects of cross-
border banking?
Despite the highly stylized formulation of the banking sector in our model of a monetary union, the
simulation exercises of the previous sections clearly illustrate how cross-border lending can act as an
amplifying factor in the business cycle fluctuations within monetary unions, especially when lending
standards are not adequately determined at the regional level. In this context, the obvious question
is: What are the consequences of cross-border lending for the conduction of monetary policy? Or, in
a more plain wording: Can monetary policy alleviate some of the destabilizing effects of cross-border
banking?
Since we model a banking sector (both wholesale and retail branches) with monopolistic power as
in Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) in the present theoretical framework,
monetary policy has only imperfect control of the effective loan interest rates at the regional level.
However, in contrast to these studies which analyzed only closed economies, in the present paper
we explore the open-economy, union-wide implications of such a modeling approach for the banking
sector in the presence of trade links and cross-border banking. In other words, our framework allows
us to investigate how monetary policy should be conducted in the presence of an imperfect interest
rate pass-through to the monetary union sphere.
In order to address this imperfect pass-through problem, recent studies introducing a bank-
ing sector into the DSGE model such as Cúrdia and Woodford (2010), Gertler and Karadi (2011),
Goodfriend and McCallum (2007) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014) have proposed incorporat-
ing the spread between the loan and the policy rate in an otherwise standard monetary policy rule.
24
In our framework, this implies including the loan rate spreads in both regions H and F, namely
rbH
t
and rbF
t
­ weighted by the respective relative regional sizes ­ in eq. (44), delivering

represents the reaction
parameter of the policy rate to increases in the weighted average of the loan rate spreads in the two
monetary union regions.
In Figure 5 we show the variances of the key model variables as functions of different values of
the monetary policy parameters 
and s
under the scenario 2 specification of the LTV borrowing
constraint discussed in the previous section. The purpose of this exercise is of course to analyze the
effects of implementing an unconventional monetary policy rule as discussed in the recent literature.
Figure 5 contains a variety of important results. To begin with, it is interesting to note that the
variances of all reported variables are nonlinear functions in 
and s
, as the irregular shape of the
surfaces indicate. Nonetheless, a common feature of all variances is that they decrease in 
for all
considered values of s
. This underlines the common notion that inflation targeting is key for the
stabilization not only of inflation, but for the other key macroeconomic variables as well.
In contrast, the relationship between macroeconomic volatility and s
is less straightforward. On
the one hand, concerning aggregate output in the Southern and Northern regions, the graphs in Figure
5 show that the incorporation of the unconventional term s
( · ) in the monetary policy rule, i.e. the
switch from s
= 0 to s
= 0.05, leads to an increase of the output variance in the two economies.
However, for 
 [1.5 , 1.65], a further increase of s
leads to a small decrease in Y H
t
's variance, but
not in Y F
t
's. As the graphs concerning aggregate consumption and investment illustrate, this effect
results primarily from the reaction of consumption volatility to these parameter changes. By contrast,
it is particularly noteworthy that higher values of s
lead to a lower volatility of aggregate investment
in both Southern and Northern regions for rather low values of 
and s
, i.e., when monetary policy
targets inflation with the strength commonly assumed (
= 1.5) and reacts only with about s
= 0.2
to changes in loan rate spreads. Note that this effect is more pronounced regarding investment in the
Southern region.
Further, the dependence of the loans' variance with respect to s
is also worth being highlighted,
as it demonstrates in a clear manner that this type of unconventional monetary policy works to
contribute to macroeconomic stabilization through the reduction in the amount of (eventually desta-
bilizing) cross-border lending. Similar to the effect on aggregate investment, we observe in Figure
5 that a medium reaction to interest rate spreads with s
 [0.2 , 0.4] is necessary to reduce the
volatility of loans if the central bank targets inflation with 
= 1.5. Finally, at the usual inflation
targeting parameter our results show that a mild reaction to interest rate spreads will also stabilize

5 Concluding Remarks
What are the macroeconomic consequences of cross-border banking and a rule-of-thumb determination
of lending standards? In this paper, we try to shed some light onto this and other questions by setting
up a two-region DSGE model of a monetary union featuring a banking sector along the lines of
Gerali et al. (2010) and Gambacorta and Signoretti (2014), allowing us to differentiate the effects of
cross-border lending from the standard trade links of two interacting economies in a monetary union.
Against the background of the recent credit-fuelled housing booms and busts experienced in some
euro area countries such as Spain and Ireland, we investigate the macroeconomic consequences of asym-
metric rule-of-thumb lending standards applied in a cross-border manner. Specifically, we compare a
scenario where the LTV ratio that banks demand of entrepreneurs depends on regional productivity
shocks to a scenario where desired LTV ratios are driven by productivity shocks from one dominating
region, thereby relaxing borrowing constraints for all firms after a positive technology shock in that
region. The latter scenario is motivated by the observation of converging real interest rates after the
start of the European monetary union, with a corresponding increase in cross-border capital flows as
financial markets applied the low risk standards of the Northern region throughout the whole mone-
tary union. Our simulation results suggest that such type of cross-border lending practices amplifies
the effects of a region-specific technology shock in both regions of the monetary union, leading to
business fluctuations in the other country generated by the relaxation of lending standards, and not
by corresponding changes in macroeconomic fundamentals. Furthermore, such developments lead
to a significant increase in the volatility of all main macro variables in both regions of the monetary
union. We thus show that under certain conditions the financial sector may exacerbate macroeconomic
imbalances originating via the trade channel within the monetary union.
Given the significant effects that such a larger aggregate volatility implies both in macroeconomic
and social terms, our results suggest that macroeconomic policy (both fiscal and monetary) concerned
with stabilizing the regions within a monetary union should pay attention to the nature of cross-border
lending within the union, especially if banks do not assign region-specific lending standards. Further,
our simulation results indicate that a central bank adjusting to changes in loan spread rates with a
relatively small coefficient may enhance macroeconomic stability in the face of rule-of-thumb cross-
border banking. This effect, however, may not replace a tighter regulation and standardization of
lending practices across the monetary union intended to reduce destabilizing capital in- and outflows
between the regions within monetary unions such as the euro area.
