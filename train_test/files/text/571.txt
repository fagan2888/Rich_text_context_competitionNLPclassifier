OBJECTIVE: To compare the sexual function of older
women who had bilateral oophorectomy with that of
older women who had retained their ovaries.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved analysis of
1,352 women aged 57 to 85 years from the National Social
Life, Health, and Aging Project. Women with previous
bilateral oophorectomy were compared with women who
retained their ovaries. The primary outcome of interest was
self-report of sexual ideation, chosen because having
thoughts about sexual experiences is not prohibited by
either a partner or a woman's own physical limitations.
RESULTS: Three hundred fifty-six (25.8%) women reported
previous bilateral oophorectomy. Our analysis achieved
90% power to detect a difference of 10% in sexual ideation.
No significant difference in the report of sexual ideation was
found between women with previous bilateral oophorec-
tomy and women who retained their ovaries (54.5% and
95% confidence interval [CI] 48.1­61.0 compared with
49.9% and 95% CI 45.3­54.5, P.230), even after adjusting
for current hormone therapy, age, education, and race
(adjusted odds ratio 1.32, 95% CI 0.96­1.80).
CONCLUSION: Bilateral oophorectomy may not play a
pivotal role in sexual ideation and function among older
women.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II
Hysterectomy is the most commonly performed
gynecologic surgical procedure, with more than
600,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the
United States.1,2 The majority of hysterectomies are
performed for benign indications. This leaves the
choice to undergo concomitant prophylactic bilateral
oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy between a
woman and her surgeon. Currently, 25% to 55% of
benign hysterectomies are performed with concomitant
elective oophorectomy.3­5 Elective oophorectomy is of-
fered to women to reduce the risk of future ovarian
cancer and adnexal surgery. However, ovarian conser-
vation has been demonstrated to increase overall life-
expectancy and decrease coronary heart disease.6,7
Postmenopausal ovaries have been demonstrated
to produce both testosterone and androstenedione
that are peripherally converted to estrogens in adi-
pose cells.8 Postmenopausal women maintain serum
testosterone levels even two to three decades after
menopause.9,10 In postmenopausal women, removal
of the postmenopausal ovaries generally results in a
50% decline in circulating androgen levels.8,11,12 Se-
rum androgens are believed to be important in the
maintenance of libido and sexual function in post-
menopausal women.13 However, the effect of elective
oophorectomy on sexual function, including ideation,
partnerships, activity, frequency, attitudes, and prob-
lems in older women, has not been well-studied. The
primary objective of this study was to compare sexual
ideation and function of older women who underwent
bilateral oophorectomy with that of older women
who had retained their ovaries.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
We performed a cross-section analysis of the 2005­2006
National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project dataset to

National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project sur-
vey was conducted to investigate sexuality in a na-
tionally representative probability sample of commu-
nity-dwelling older adults in the United States aged 57
to 85 years old. Adults were targeted for possible
participation in the National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project study from a previous population-based
study.17 A unique aspect of the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project is adequate representation via
oversampling of previously understudied minority pop-
ulations (black and Hispanic women) within the data-
set.17 The overall survey response rate was 75.5%, with
3,322 adults participating in the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project between July 2005 and
March 2006. Information in the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project was obtained from in-home
interviews of trained professional interviewers in both
English and Spanish using computer-assisted personal
interview methods.18 Data were collected by the Na-
tional Opinion Research Center through the University
of Chicago and were maintained by the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan to ensure
the quality of the dataset.18,19 The current study is a
secondary database analysis focused solely on women
without cancer with known oophorectomy status. Male
participants (n1,455, 43.8%) and women with a previ-
ous cancer diagnosis (n198, 6%) were excluded from
our analyses. This study was exempt from review by the
Yale University Institutional Review Board because it
involves research of an existing dataset from a public
source.
The purpose of this study was to compare sexual
function of older women who reported previous bilat-
eral oophorectomy with that of older women who had
retained their ovaries. Women reporting no previous
oophorectomy or unilateral procedure were considered
as women who retained their ovaries. The primary
outcome of interest was self-report of sexual ideation at
least once monthly. We chose sexual ideation as our
primary outcome because having thoughts about sexual
experiences should not be affected by either the wom-
an's own physical limitations or the partner's issues (lack
of partner or partner's physical limitations). Because
sexual function is known to change with age, women
were stratified into the age categories of 57­64 years,
65­74 years, and 75­85 years to obtain percentage
estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI).16­18 Fi-
nally, we examined the difference between women
who underwent oophorectomy before self-reported
menopause and women who underwent oophorec-
tomy after menopause.
Secondary outcomes included current sexual part-
nerships, sexual frequency within the past 12 months,
types of sexual activities, sexual attitudes, and sexual
problems. A current partner was defined as the woman
reporting being currently married, cohabitating, or hav-
ing an intimate partner. Women reporting no current
sexual partner were not asked questions about sexual
frequency or types of sexual activity (except for mastur-
bation). Sexual frequency included the participation in
any sexual activity within the past 12 months. Sex was
defined as "any mutually voluntary activity with another
person that involves sexual contact, whether or not
intercourse or orgasm occurs." Types of sexual activity
reported including foreplay, vaginal coitus, receiving or
performing oral sex, and masturbation. All women were
asked questions about their own sexual attitudes, values,
and beliefs. For women reporting a current sexual
partner, women were asked about sexual problems,
including interest, lubrication, anorgasmia, dyspareunia,
and avoidance of sexual activity because of problems.
Statistical analyses, including descriptive and in-
ferential statistics with percentage estimates and 95%
CI, were performed as appropriate. The National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project dataset allowed
data to be weighted to provide an estimate of popu-
lation characteristics representative of community-
dwelling older Americans aged 57 to 85 years. Not all
women answered all questions. Survey weights were
used to account for the differential probability of
inclusion in the sample and differential probability of
nonresponse in all the analyses. Percentage estimates
and 95% CI were obtained to report weighted fre-
quencies. Model fitting and variance estimates used in
the construction of CI account for the stratified and
clustered nature of the design to produce unbiased
estimates of standard errors. Logistic regression anal-
ysis was used to assess the association between sexual
ideation (primary outcome) and oophorectomy status,
current hormone therapy, demographic characteris-
tics, and clinical characteristics. Potential confounders
were considered for inclusion in the final model based
on their significance in univariable analysis (P.1).
Significant confounders were included in the final
adjusted model if they continued to affect the final
model (P.05). Oophorectomy status and current
systemic hormone therapy were included in the final
model because these were our main independent
variables of interest. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS 9.2. Assuming a prevalence of
sexual ideation of 52.8% (based on Lindau et al20), our
analysis achieved 90% power to detect a difference of
10% in sexual ideation with a significance level () of
0.05 (two-sided).

RESULTS
In total, 1,352 women were included in this analysis:
356 (25.8%) women who reported previous bilateral
oophorectomy and 996 (74.2%) women who had
retained their ovaries. No women were missing data
on oophorectomy status.
Demographics and clinical characteristics were
similar between the two groups, although women
with a previous bilateral oophorectomy were more
likely to report current hormone therapy (59.1%, 95%
CI 52.9­65.3) and more likely to report previous
hysterectomy (97.0%, 95% CI 94.9­99.2) compared
with women who retained their ovaries (current hor-
mone therapy: 47.2%, 95% CI 43.7­50.6; previous
hysterectomy: 23.3%, 95% CI 20.0­26.5) (Table 1).
Mean age (68.70.5 compared with 68.00.3, P.17)
and self-reported health (very good or excellent:
41.6% compared with 46.2%, P.70) were similar be-
tween women with previous bilateral oophorectomy
and women who had retained their ovaries. Among
women with previous bilateral oophorectomy, 75.4%
(95% CI 69.4­81.4) had their ovaries removed before
menopause.
Our primary outcome of interest was self-report
of sexual ideation at least once monthly. No differ-
ences were observed between women with previous
bilateral oophorectomy and women who had retained
their ovaries (54.5% and 95% CI 48.1­61.0 compared
with 49.9% and 95% CI 45.3­54.5, P.23) (Table 2).
Women who retained their ovaries did not demon-
strate significantly increased odds of sexual ideation
compared with women with previous bilateral oopho-

(estrogen or progesterone) age group, education, and
race (Table 3). Age group, education, and race were
found to be significant in univariable analysis (P.1)
and to affect the final logistic regression model
(P.05). On univariable analysis, hysterectomy status,
menopausal status at the time of oophorectomy, and
years since oophorectomy did not affect the model
(P.1) and were not included in the final logistic
regression model. Sexual ideation varied by age, with
decreasing sexual ideation reported by increasing age
group, with 64.4% (95% CI 58.3­70.6%) of women
aged 57­64 years, 48.3% (95% CI 43.2­53.5%) of
women aged 65­74 years, and 32.3% (95% CI 26.8­
37.8%) of women aged 75­85 years reporting sexual
ideation.(Table 4) Pair-wise comparisons demonstrated
a significant difference between women aged 65­74
years compared with women 57­64 years (P.001) and
women aged 75­85 years compared with women 57 to
64 years (P.001) (Table 4).
No differences were observed in the number of
women reporting a current partner between women
with previous bilateral oophorectomy and women
who had retained their ovaries (59.6% and 95% CI
53.8­65.3 compared with 63.6% and 95% CI 60.3­
66.9, P.22). The prevalence of a current partner
again decreased with increasing age category.
No differences were observed in the percentage
of women reporting sexual activity in the past 12
months between women with previous bilateral oo-
phorectomy and women who had retained their
ovaries (42.2% and 95% CI 34.2­50.2 compared with
44.5% and 95% CI 40.8­48.3, P.61). Further com-
parisons of sexual frequency of once monthly or less,
two­three times per month, and 1­2 times per week
or more did not demonstrate a statistically significant
difference (P.18) (Table 2).
Among all women with current sexual partners,
women who reported previous bilateral oophorec-
tomy were more likely to report vaginal intercourse
(90.1% and 95% CI 84.7­95.5 compared with 82.3%

and 95% CI 78.2­86.5, P.04) compared with
women who had retained their ovaries; however,
foreplay (90.2% and 95% CI 85.4­94.9 compared
with 87.3% and 95% CI 83.4­91.3, P.35), receiving
oral sex (8.3% and 95% CI 1.0­15.5 compared with
9.7% and 95% CI 6.5­12.8, P.74), performing oral
sex (11.6% and 95% CI 3.3­20.0 compared with
11.2% and 95% CI 6.1­16.2, P.90) were similar.
Women with previous bilateral oophorectomy
were significantly more likely than women with re-
tained ovaries to find a "married person having sex
with someone other than partner" to be "always
wrong" (P.002), "always wrong even if partner has
dementia" (P.02), and "always wrong even if partner
is physically ill" (P.003). Otherwise, no significant
differences were observed between the two groups in
other sexual attitudes and beliefs, including religious
beliefs guiding sexual behavior (P.30) and sex being
essential to maintain a relationship (P.94).
Report of sexual problems were similar between
women with previous bilateral oophorectomy com-
pared with women with retained ovaries, including
lack of interest (P.88), vaginal lubrication (P.90),
premature climax (P.94), inability to climax (P.09),
pain with intercourse (P.60), lack of pleasure (P.14),
performance anxiety (P.50), and avoidance of sex
because of problems (P.86).
Among women with previous bilateral oophorec-
tomy, 75.4% (95% CI 69.4­81.4) had their ovaries
removed before menopause. There was no significant
difference in sexual ideation between women under-
going premenopausal oophorectomy and postmeno-
pausal oophorectomy (57.5% and 95% CI 50.0­64.7
compared with 49.1% and 95% CI 35.8­62.5%,
P.12). There were no significant differences in the
report of sexual problems between women undergo-
ing premenopausal compared with postmenopausal
oophorectomy, including lack of interest (P.97), vagi-
nal lubrication (P.45), inability to climax (P.84), pain
with intercourse (P.23), lack of pleasure (P.21), and
avoidance of sex because of problems (P.26).
DISCUSSION
We found sexual ideation and function were similar
among community-dwelling older women with previ-
ous bilateral oophorectomy compared with women
who had retained their ovaries. Lindau et al16 previ-
ously reported on the sexual activity, frequency,
attitudes, and problems of both women and men from
this project. Their report shows that sexual function
decreases with increasing age. However, hormonal
status was not considered in their work.
One reported drawback of prophylactic oopho-
rectomy women is decreased sexual function and
hypoactive sexual desire disorder.21­24 In one small
prospective study conducted in Turkey, sexual func-
tion scores were found to significantly decrease in
postmenopausal women 6 months after hysterectomy
with bilateral oophorectomy when compared with
preoperative scores.22 The short length of this study
and a lack of a control group of women with retained
ovaries limit our knowledge of how oophorectomy
affects sexual function in postmenopausal women in
the long-term. Finch et al21 reported that premeno-

* Does not include 18 respondents for whom menopausal status at the time of oophorectomy is unknown. Estimates are weighted to
account for differential probabilities of selection and differential nonresponse. Model fitting and variance estimates used in the
construction of confidence intervals account for the stratified and clustered nature of the design to produce unbiased estimates of
standard errors. The analyses for sexual activity (not including masturbation), frequency, and problems are limited to the 720
(53.9%) of women who reported having a current sexual partner.
840 Erekson et al Sexual Function After Oophorectomy OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
pausal women with BRCA mutations undergoing pro-
phylactic oophorectomy report a decrease in sexual
functioning compared with postmenopausal women
with BRCA mutations undergoing the same proce-
dure; however, this study was limited to follow-up of
1 year after surgery. Finally, Leiblum et al23 reported
hypoactive sexual desire disorder was more common
among women younger than age 50 years who were
surgically menopausal compared with their intact
counterparts; however, no difference was seen in
sexual desire in women older than age 50 years who
had undergone surgical menopause. Although evi-
dence suggests that premenopausal bilateral oopho-
rectomy has a negative effect on sexual function, our
findings and those of Leiblum et al23 suggest the effect
diminishes with increasing time from menopause. It is
possible that the effects of bilateral oophorectomy on
sexual function decrease as women age; therefore,
age, rather than oophorectomy, is the main contribu-
tor to sexual dysfunction in older women.
Limitations of our study include the self-report of
oophorectomy. However, because women with one
or more retained ovary may have mistakenly re-
ported bilateral oophorectomy, and women mistak-
enly reporting to have intact ovaries may have under-
gone bilateral procedure, we believe misclassification
would be nondifferential. Our study is also limited by
its cross-sectional design. Women were not asked
about sexual function before and after oophorectomy;
therefore, causality cannot be determined. However,
our findings suggest that oophorectomy status is not
associated with a permanent and lasting effect on
sexual function in older women. Our study is limited
by being a secondary database analysis. Further infor-
mation on certain variables was not collected. Specifi-
cally, we only have information on sexual ideation at
least once monthly. No information about the monthly
frequency of sexual ideation was available. Finally, this
study discusses a sensitive topic and is limited by partic-
ipant nonresponse to certain questions. As reported by
Lindau et al,16 overall 2% to7% of respondents declined
to answer questions about sexual activity and 14%
declined to answer questions about masturbation. To
account for nonresponse, weights were used to adjust for
the bias of differential nonresponse. Our study is also
strengthened by the large sample size representative of
the community-dwelling older women in the United
States and detailed information on numerous aspects of
sexual function in this older population, enhancing the
study's external validity. In brief, our findings suggest
that elective oophorectomy may not play a long-term
pivotal role in the sexual ideation and function of older
women.
