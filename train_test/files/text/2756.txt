aged and older adults in six low- and
middle-income countries

Abstract
Background: Sedentary behavior (SB) is, irrespective of a person's physical activity levels, associated with a wide
range of deleterious outcomes such as diabetes, stroke and associated premature mortality. There are no nationally
representative, multi-national, population-based studies investigating the relationship between SB, chronic
conditions, and physical multimorbidity (i.e., two or more chronic physical conditions). Thus, this cross-sectional
study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, physical multimorbidity and SB among
community-dwelling adults in six low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We also explored the influential
factors of these relationships.
Method: The Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey included 34,129 adults aged 50 years. SB
was self-reported and expressed as a categorical variable [<8 or 8 h per day (high SB)]. Eleven chronic physical
conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes, edentulism, hearing
problems, hypertension, stroke, visual impairment) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation
analyses were conducted.
Results: The prevalence of physical multimorbidity and high SB (8 h/day) were 45.5% (43.7%­47.4%) and 10.8%
(9.7%­12.1%), respectively. The prevalence of high SB increased in a linear fashion from 7.1% in people with no
chronic condition to 24.1% in those with 4 chronic conditions. In the multivariable analysis, visual impairment
(OR = 2.62), stroke (OR = 2.02), chronic back pain (OR = 1.70) hearing problems (OR = 1.58), chronic lung disease
(OR = 1.48), asthma (OR = 1.39), arthritis (OR = 1.22) and multimorbidity (OR = 1.41) were significantly associated
with high SB. Disability explained more than 50% of the association for all chronic conditions with particularly high
percentages (>80%) for arthritis, asthma, and multimorbdity. Mobility problems explained 88.1% and 85.1% of the
association of SB with arthritis and physical multimorbidiy, respectively. Pain was highly influential in the SB-arthritis
relationship (85.6%). Sleep/energy problems explained between 9.3% (stroke) to 49.1% (arthritis) of the association,
and cognitive problems from 21.5% (stroke) to 33.4% (hearing problems). Findings for anxiety and depression were
mixed.
Conclusion: In LMICs, those with chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity are significantly more sedentary.
Targeted messages to reduce time spent sedentary among individuals with chronic conditions may ameliorate
associated disability, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves the most important risk factors for SB.

Background
The average life expectancy is increasing worldwide [1].
Irrespective of the socioeconomic development of a
country, the main causes of death and disability in
middle-aged to older adults (i.e. 50 years or older) are
non-communicable diseases (NCDs), many of which often
occur in combination [2]. The co-occurrence of two or
more chronic physical conditions is known as physical
multimorbidity [3]. With increasing population and life
expectancy, the disease burden of physical multimorbidity
to both individuals and societies are increasing [4]. Al-
though data are scarce, in low- and middle-income coun-
tries (LMICs) about half of middle-aged to older adults
experience physical multimorbidity (i.e. 2 or more chronic
conditions), about 25% have at least three, and about 10%
four or more chronic conditions [5]. Physical multimor-
bidity is an important risk concept as it is associated with
a lower quality of life [6], increased health-care utilization
and costs [7], and ultimately, higher risk for premature
mortality [8]. There is a consensus that in the years to
come, this disease burden will be greatest in LMICs [9],
but knowledge on physical multimorbidity from LMICs is
limited compared with HICs (95% of the available studies
are from HICs), despite the fact that nearly 80% of NCD
related deaths occur in LMICs [10].
The promotion of physical activity is an essential strat-
egy within the multifaceted care of middle-aged to older
adults for the prevention and management of chronic
disease and physical multimorbidity [11]. Regular phys-
ical activity contributes to the primary and secondary
prevention of a wide range of chronic diseases [12], im-
proves quality of life [13], and is associated with reduced
risk of premature death [14]. There is also increasing
evidence demonstrating that sedentary behavior (SB)
should be considered in this multifaceted care as it is, ir-
respective of a person's physical activity levels, associated
with a wide range of deleterious outcomes such as dia-
betes, stroke and associated premature mortality [15].
SB refers to any waking behavior characterized by an
energy expenditure 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs),
while in a sitting, reclining or lying posture [16]. SB is
highly prevalent and pervasive in societies across the
world [17, 18]. A recent systematic review, virtually
exclusively among western societies, demonstrated that
middle-aged to older adults spend 65­80% of their
waking day being sedentary [19].
Research investigating the relationship between SB
and chronic diseases has solely focused on high-income
countries. In addition, there is a particular dearth of re-
search on SB and physical multimorbidity. In the only
study on this topic to date, among 2048 American adults
(mean age = 42.7 years; 50.9% male), every 60 min/day
increase in SB was associated with an 11% (adjusted OR
=1.11; 95%CI = 1.01­1.21; P = 0.03) increased odds of
being multimorbid (i.e. having 2 morbidities) [20].
Moreover, the authors found that SB was associated with
multimorbidity independent of light-intensity physical
activity and adherence to moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity guidelines, which underscores the importance of
minimizing prolonged SB (in addition to promoting
physical activity) in the treatment of multimorbidity.
The lack of nationally representative population-based
studies investigating the associations between SB, chronic
conditions, and physical multimorbidity in LMICs is an
important research gap given the rapid increase in chronic
diseases in these countries, mainly due to changes in life-
style [21]. Furthermore, the association between chronic
conditions or multimorbidity on SB may differ in LMICs
due to different disease profiles [22], suboptimal treatment
of chronic conditions [23, 24], and differences in know-
ledge regarding the risks of being sedentary [25]. In
addition, at the population level, there is a paucity of infor-
mation on factors that might influence the relationship
between SB, chronic diseases and physical multimorbidity.
In this study we focused on physical (mobility, disability,
pain and discomfort) and mental (cognition, sleep and en-
ergy, anxiety and depression) conditions as these variables
have all been associated with SB [26, 27] and the presence
of chronic conditions [5]. Given the aforementioned gaps
within the literature, we aimed to assess the association
between chronic conditions or physical multimorbidity
and SB among community-dwelling adults aged 50 or
older in six LMICs, and to assess the factors that might in-
fluence this relationship. We hypothesize that higher
levels of SB are associated with the presence of chronic
conditions and physical multimorbidity.
Methods
The survey
Data from the SAGE were analyzed. This survey was
undertaken in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, Russia, and
South Africa between 2007 and 2010. Based on the
World Bank classification at the time of the survey, all
of these countries were LMICs. Details of the survey
methodology have been published elsewhere [28]. In
brief, in order to obtain nationally representative sam-
ples, a multistage clustered sampling design method was
used. The sample consisted of adults aged 18 years
with oversampling of those aged 50 years. Trained in-
terviewers conducted face-to-face interviews using a
standard questionnaire. Standard translation procedures
were undertaken to ensure comparability between coun-
tries. If a respondent was unable to undertake the inter-
view because of limited cognitive function, then a
separate questionnaire was administered to a proxy re-
spondent. These individuals were not included in the
current study. The survey response rate ranged from
51% (Mexico) to 93% (China). Sampling weights were

constructed to adjust for the population structure as
reported by the United Nations Statistical Division.
Ethical approval was obtained from the WHO Ethical
Review Committee and local ethics research review
boards. Written informed consent was obtained from
all participants.
Sedentary behaviour (outcome variable)
In order to assess SB, participants were asked to state
the total time they usually spent (expressed in minutes
per day) sitting or reclining including at work, at home,
getting to and from places, or with friends (e.g. sitting at
a desk, sitting with friends, travelling in car, bus, train,
reading, playing cards or watching television). This did
not include time spent sleeping. The variable on SB was
used in the analysis as a categorical [<8 (coded 0) or
8 h (coded 1) per day] variable. The eight-hour cut-off
was chosen as previous research indicated that being
sedentary for 8 h/day in the general population is asso-
ciated with a higher risk for premature mortality [29].
Chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity (exposures)
Eleven chronic physical conditions (angina, arthritis,
asthma, chronic back pain, chronic lung disease, diabetes,
edentulism, hearing problems, hypertension, stroke, visual
impairment) were assessed. Chronic back pain was de-
fined as having had back pain everyday during the last
30 days. Respondents who answered affirmatively to the
question "Have you lost all of your natural teeth?" were
considered to have edentulism. The participant was con-
sidered to have hearing problems if the interviewer ob-
served this condition during the survey. Blood pressure
was measured three times with a one-minute interval with
the use of a wrist blood pressure monitor (Medistar Wrist
Blood Pressure Model S) and the mean value of the three
measurements was calculated. Hypertension was defined
as having at least one of the following: systolic blood pres-
sure  140 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure  90 mmHg;
or self-reported diagnosis. Visual impairment was defined
as having extreme difficulty in seeing and recognizing a
person that the participant knows across the road [30]. A
validity study showed that this response likely corresponds
to WHO definitions of visual impairment (20/60 or 0.48
logMAR) [30]. Diabetes and stroke were solely based on
lifetime self-reported diagnosis.
For other conditions, the participant was considered
to have the condition in the presence of either one of
the following: self-reported diagnosis; or symptom-based
diagnosis based on algorithms. We used these algo-
rithms, which have been used in previous studies using
the same dataset, to detect undiagnosed cases [31, 32].
Specifically, the validated Rose questionnaire was used
for angina [33], and other previously validated symptom-
based algorithms were used for arthritis, asthma, and
chronic lung disease [31, 34]. The questions used to
assess self-reported diagnosis and the symptom-based
algorithms are provided in Additional file 1: Tables S1
and S2. The total number of chronic conditions was cal-
culated and categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Multimor-
bidity was defined as 2 chronic conditions [32].
Mediators
Health status
Health status was evaluated with eight health-related
questions pertaining to four health domains including:
(a) mobility; (b) pain and discomfort; (c) cognition; and
(d) sleep and energy. Each of the four domains corre-
sponds to those in common health related quality of life
outcome measures such as the Short Form-12 (SF-12)
[35], the Health Utilities Index Mark-3 (HUI) [36] and
the EUROQOL-5D [37]. Each domain consists of two
questions that assessed health function in the past
30 days. The actual questions can be found in
Additional file 1: Table S3. Each item was scored on a
five-point scale ranging from `none' to `extreme/cannot
do'. For each separate domain, we used factor analysis
with polychoric correlations to obtain a factor score
which was later converted to scores ranging from 0 to
100 with higher values representing worse health func-
tion [38, 39].
Anxiety
In accordance with previous publications using a dataset
with the identical question, those who claimed to have
severe/extreme problems with worry or anxiety in the
past 30 days were considered to have anxiety [40, 41].
Depression
Questions based on the World Mental Health Survey
version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view [42] were used for the endorsement of past 12-
month DSM-IV depression using the same algorithm
used in previous studies using the same dataset [32, 43]
(Details provided in Additional file 1: Table S4).
Disability
Disability was assessed by the use of the 12-item
validated version of the World Health Organization
Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0)
[44]. Item Response Theory analysis was used to create a
scale ranging from 0 (no disability) to 100 (maximum
disability) [45].
Control variables
These included sex, age, wealth, highest level of educa-
tion achieved (primary, secondary, tertiary), setting
(urban or rural), living arrangement (alone or not), and
employment status (engaged in paid work 2 days in last
Vancampfort et al. International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity (2017) 14:147 Page 3 of 13
7 days: Y/N). Wealth quintiles were created based on
country-specific income.
Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed with Stata 14.1
(Stata Corp LP, College station, Texas). The analysis
was restricted to those aged 50 years given the high
prevalence of chronic physical conditions in this age
group. We conducted multivariable logistic regression
analysis to assess the association between the number
of chronic conditions including physical multimorbidity
(2 chronic physical conditions) or each of the 11
chronic conditions (exposure variables) and sedentary
behavior (outcome). Analyses using the overall sample
and by age groups (50­64, 65 years) was done. Next,
in order to gain an understanding of the extent to
which various factors may explain the relation of indi-
vidual chronic conditions and physical multimorbidity
with SB, we conducted mediation analysis using the
overall sample. We did not conduct this analysis for an-
gina, diabetes, edentulism, and hypertension as these
conditions were not significantly associated with SB in
the overall sample. We focused on anxiety, cognition,
depression, disability, mobility, pain/discomfort, and
sleep/energy for their previously reported association
with the exposure (chronic physical conditions) and the
outcome (sedentary behavior). We used the khb
(Karlson Holm Breen) command in Stata [46] for this
purpose. This method can be applied in logistic regres-
sion models and decomposes the total effect (i.e., un-
adjusted for the influential factor) of a variable into
direct (i.e. the effect of chronic conditions or multimor-
bidity on SB adjusted for the factor) and indirect effects
(i.e. the mediational effect). Using this method, the per-
centage of the main association explained by the medi-
ator can also be calculated. Each potential mediator
was included in the model individually. All regression
analyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, wealth,
setting, unemployment, living arrangement, and coun-
try. Country adjustment was done by including dummy
variables for each country. When the individual chronic
conditions were the exposure variable, the models were
also adjusted for the presence of other chronic illness
to account for comorbid chronic conditions. This vari-
able included information on whether the individual
had any of the other ten chronic conditions (Y/N). All
variables were included in the models as categorical
variables with the exception of age, pain/discomfort,
cognition, sleep/energy, and disability (continuous
variables). Under 5% of the data were missing for the
variables used in the analysis. Complete-case analysis
was done. The sample weighting and the complex study
design were taken into account in the analyses. Results
from the regression analyses are presented as odds
ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The
level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
The final analytical sample consisted of 34,129 individ-
uals (China n = 13,175; Ghana n = 4305; India
n = 6560; Mexico n = 2313; Russia n = 3938; South
Africa n = 3838) aged 50 years. The median (IQR) age
was 62 (55­70) years and 47.9% were males. The preva-
lence of physical multimorbidity and high SB (i.e. 8 h/
day) were 45.5% (43.7%­47.4%) and 10.8% (9.7%­12.1%),
respectively (Table 1).
The prevalence of high SB increased in a linear fashion
with an increasing number of chronic conditions ranging
from 7.1% in people with no chronic condition to 24.1%
in those with 4 or more chronic conditions (Fig. 1).
The results of the multivariable logistic regression ana-
lysis assessing the association between chronic condi-
tions or physical multimorbidity and high SB are
presented in Table 2. In the overall sample, visual im-
pairment (OR = 2.62), stroke (OR = 2.02), chronic back
pain (OR = 1.70) hearing problems (OR = 1.58), chronic
lung disease (OR = 1.48), asthma (OR = 1.39), arthritis
(OR = 1.22), and physical multimorbidity (OR = 1.41)
were significantly associated with high SB. When the
analysis was stratified by age groups, arthritis, chronic
back pain, hearing problems, and visual impairment, and
physical multimorbidity were only significantly associ-
ated with high SB in the older age group, while asthma
was only associated with high SB in the middle-aged
group (P < 0.05). In terms of the number of chronic con-
ditions, in the overall sample, compared to those who no
chronic conditions, the presence of one or 2 chronic
conditions was not significantly associated with high SB
but the presence of 3 (OR = 1.55; p < 0.001) and 4 or
more (OR = 2.22; p < 0.001) was associated with high
SB. When stratified by age groups, in those aged 65 years
or older, having 2 chronic conditions was significantly
associated with higher odds (OR = 1.67) for high SB,
while this odds increased to 2.36 and 2.98 for the pres-
ence of 3 and 4 or more chronic conditions, respectively
(P < 0.001).
The results of the mediation analysis among those
aged 50 years are shown in Tables 3 and 4.
For the individual chronic conditions, anxiety did not
explain the association of high SB with arthritis and
stroke while for other conditions it explained from 6.0%
(hearing problems) to 23.5% (visual impairment) of the
association. Cognitive problems explained the relation-
ship from 21.5% (stroke) to 33.4% (hearing problems).
Depression was not an influential factor in the associ-
ation of high SB with hearing problems and stroke, while
it explained between 6.2% (chronic back pain) to 13.2%
(asthma) of the association for the other conditions.

Discussion
General findings
To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the
first large-scale (n = 34,129), multinational (6 LMICs)
analysis investigating associations of SB with chronic
conditions and physical multimorbidity. The current
data confirm the findings from a previous study con-
ducted in a high-income country showing that SB is as-
sociated with a higher risk for physical multimorbidity
[20]. We found that most chronic conditions were asso-
ciated with a high SB status (i.e. eight or more hours per
day) in the overall sample, although this relationship was
most notable among the oldest population (i.e. 65 years
or older). Our mediation analysis showed that disability

and mobility difficulties were important factors for most
of the chronic conditions studied, while pain was a cen-
tral factor for arthritis. As for physical multimorbidity,
disability, mobility difficulties and pain were also import-
ant factors mediating high SB. Sleep/energy and cogni-
tive problems explained the relation between SB and
each chronic condition to a lesser extent while findings
for anxiety, and depression were mixed. The factors
identified in our study, which may explain the relation-
ship between chronic conditions and physical multimor-
bidity with SB, should however be confirmed in
prospective studies.

be sedentary for eight or more hours per day. These re-
lationships appear to be mainly explained by disability,
mobility difficulties, and pain while cognitive problems,
depressive feelings, and sleep problems may also play a
role. In both conditions, pain might cause mobility and
sleep problems and ultimately feelings of depression,
which in turn can all result in people being more sed-
entary. Previous literature in Western populations has
demonstrated that pain can result in mobility limita-
tions, higher levels of SB [47], and depression [48].
Clearly, such an interplay of pain, mobility limitations
and depression among people with physical multimor-
bidity could play an even more pronounced role. Next
to this, some SBs such as TV viewing, have been linked
previously to poorer cognitive function in middle-aged
to older adults [49], although this is largely drawn from
high-income populations. The reason why adults with
cognitive problems are more likely to be sedentary is
largely unknown, but clearly this warrants further ex-
ploration. One possible explanation is that cognitive
problems, such as impairments in executive functioning
can result in difficulties in planning complex behaviors
and consequently there might be an increased risk of
falls [50]. Falls are on its turn associated with a fear of
falling again and avoidance of activities due to this fear,
which is also associated with grey matter volume loss
[51, 52]. In the case of arthritis, cognitive problems
may be linked to SB via comorbid cardiovascular risk
factors or systemic inflammatory processes [53, 54].
Sedentary time and the number of sedentary bouts per
day (i.e. 20 min) are associated with an increased 10-
year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in people with

arthritis, independent of engagement in moderate to
vigorous physical activity [55].
Our data also suggest that people with asthma were
more sedentary (OR = 1.39). It is known that many
individuals with asthma avoid physical activities for
fear of exacerbating symptoms or triggering physical
activity-induced bronchoconstriction [56]. Studies
have shown that replacing SB with light intensity
physical activity can however improve asthma control
and asthma-related quality of life [56], and is a pos-
sible protective factor against asthma development
[57]. As people with asthma are at an increased risk
for mobility problems and musculoskeletal pain [58],
interventions focusing on reducing this pain, discom-
fort and mobility problems are probably essential as
well to reduce the time spent sedentary. Not only
asthma, but also other chronic lung diseases such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may
induce mobility difficulties, pain, or disability. These
factors may predispose an individual to be more so-
cially isolated due to their restrictions in ability to
conduct activities of daily living or stigmatized as re-
spiratory symptoms are often associated with tubercu-
losis in LMICs [59].
For over a decade, targeting increases in moderate to
vigorous physical activity has been the emphasis of a
large number of exercise training and behavior change
interventions in people with COPD [60], but with lim-
ited success [61]. The lower levels of physical activity
coupled with the often fragile physical and psychological
health among patients with COPD may make reducing
SB a more suitable conduit for behavior change [62, 63].
In our study, people with COPD had 1.48 times higher
odds for being sedentary eight or more hours. Recent
evidence showed as well that SB is an independent pre-
dictor of mortality in subjects with COPD, even adjust-
ing for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and a
number of other variables. Mortality was four times
higher in subjects with COPD who spend 8.5 h/d in ac-
tivities requiring <1.5 MET [64]. Therefore, there is an
urgent need to test interventions to reduce SB including
the provision of information about the health conse-
quences of SB [65].
Stroke was associated with a 2.0 times higher odds for
high SB in our study. A previous qualitative study in
Canadian stroke survivors [66] demonstrated that there
is also limited awareness of health risks of SB among
stroke survivors.
Finally, we also found significant associations between
highly sedentary status and hearing problems and visual
impairments. Hearing problems [67] and visual impair-
ments [68] should therefore be considered as important
risk conditions for SB in LMICs. Stigma and discrimin-
ation associated with these chronic conditions and a lack
of social support may complicate daily life participation
in these populations.
Practical implications and future research
Our analyses provide further evidence for the need to
develop strategies to deal with a sedentary lifestyle in
LMICs, and offer important hypotheses for testing in
future prospective cohort studies. Our data add to the
need to increase awareness among care providers at all
levels of care in LMICs of the risks of SB of their pa-
tients. Given the evidence in the general population of
the benefits of reducing SB, we propose that it is im-
portant to test the efficacy and effectiveness of a dual
strategy in low resource settings by developing both a
smaller group of master trainers/supervisors (e.g. exer-
cise physiologists and physiotherapists) and researchers
and a larger group of practitioners (e.g. nurses) who are
responsible for minimizing SB in high risk groups. This
method has been successfully employed for cognitive
behavioral therapy in trials in LMICs [69, 70]. A
stepped-care approach, where patients start with self-
management in order to reduce their SB, may be a feas-
ible strategy in LMIC settings. Such self-management
strategies could, for example, include regular interrup-
tions in sedentary time, such as standing or walking
frequently throughout waking hours, during television
commercial breaks or while using the phone. Then, if
patients do not achieve significant reductions, they
could continue with a manualized approach under the
supervision of a non-specialist worker (e.g. nurses, oc-
cupational therapists). Patients would only be referred
to a specialist supervisor (e.g. exercise physiologists and
physiotherapists) if no significant reductions occur, for
example due to pain, sleep and cognitive problems or
mobility problems or associated anxiety and depression.
It is known from physical activity research that inclu-
sion of exercise physiologists or physiotherapists re-
duces dropout rates from lifestyle interventions and
consequently improves outcomes [71]. Careful consid-
eration of which strategies would be most efficacious,
and evaluation of this stepped-care approach, is essen-
tial. The current available evidence is, however, mainly
based on evidence from high-income countries and
showed that lifestyle interventions focusing on light
physical activity participation reduced SB by 24 min/
day (95%CI = 8 to 41 min/day, n = 3981) while in inter-
ventions focusing on reducing time spent sedentary
only, SB was reduced by 42 min/day (95% CI = 5 to
79 min/day, n = 62) [72].
Although application of self-monitoring devices and
alarms are not easy implementable in low resource set-
tings, a recent International mobile-health Intervention
on physical activity, sitting, and weight in adult em-
ployees using light-weight, low-cost, non-interactive

pedometers as a self-monitoring and motivational tool
demonstrated reduction in sedentary time. In a 100-day
program, participants were encouraged to increase inci-
dental activity such as using stairs and avoidance of sitting.
After 100 days, the time spent sedentary reduced in low-
income countries by 0.73 h per day (95% CI = -0.75 to
-0.70 h) and by 0.59 h per day 95% CI = -1.08 to -0.10 h)
in middle-income countries [73].
Efficacy trials of interventions focusing on SB among
people with chronic conditions in different cultural set-
tings across LMICs are however urgently needed. If the ef-
ficacy and effectiveness of these SB interventions are well
established in better equipped scientific settings with
trained research staff, the final step will be to fund inter-
ventions and initiatives to translate research findings into
"real-world" settings while exploring its cost-effectiveness.
In order to justify the inclusion of programs focusing on
SB reductions as a routine component in the treatment of
chronic diseases and multimorbidity in LMICs, cost-
benefit analyses should be conducted in order to quantify
the financial implications of diverting resources or invest-
ing funds into such initiatives. Therefore, next to interven-
tion studies exploring the efficacy of these programs,
effectiveness research capable of driving practice change,
along with policy-level research, is urgently required. Min-
istries of health and education will play a critical role in
this governance and policy development step. If research
shows that reducing SB is efficacious and effective in the
prevention and management of chronic diseases and mul-
timorbidity in middle-aged to older adults in LMICs, in-
terventions should be mainstreamed in existing health
systems at all levels of care. Finally, since visual impair-
ments and hearing problems are associated with higher
levels of SB, future research could explore whether pro-
grams providing hearing aids and glasses might assist
those in need to become more physically active.
Limitations and strengths
The current findings should be interpreted in light of
some limitations. First, the study is cross-sectional, and
cause and effect cannot be deduced. Therefore, it remains
unclear whether SB was caused by chronic conditions or
vice versa. For example, SB is known to be a risk factor for
cardiovascular diseases, while pain caused by arthritis may
cause people to be more sedentary. Second, whilst we in-
cluded all physical health conditions which were assessed
within the SAGE, other physical conditions such as tuber-
culosis, cancer and HIV may have been present and not
identified in the study. Therefore, the prevalence of phys-
ical multimorbidity is likely to be an underestimation and
it is possible that the association between multimorbidity
and SB could have differed if data on more chronic phys-
ical conditions were available. Third, since the information
on chronic conditions and SB was based on self-report,
reporting biases may exist. Future research should utilize
objective measures of SB. Accelerometers-inclinometers
are available that allow for valid and reliable SB behavior.
Fourth, by separating the sample into dichotomous SB
categories, we were not able to examine how different
quantities of SB may affect morbidity. Finally, the present
study did not include institutionalized people, which may
limit generalizability at a national level. Nonetheless, the
strengths of the study include the multi-national scope fo-
cused on LMICs, countries which are not investigated yet
in the prior research literature. Additionally, we investi-
gated numerous potentially modifiable factors that can be
targeted for future interventions aiming to reduce SB.
Conclusions
The current study demonstrates that middle-aged to older
adults with chronic conditions and physical multimorbid-
ity are significantly more sedentary. Future longitudinal
research is required to confirm the directionality of our
results and explore influential factors. In addition, re-
search on the efficacy and effectiveness of reducing SB in
the management of chronic diseases and physical multi-
morbidity in LMICs should be a priority for funding bod-
ies. Clinicians should consider in particular mobility
problems, disability and pain as potential barriers but also
other mental health issues such as sleep problems and
poor cognition.
