Introduction
In recent decades, several international studies have shown
the importance of preschool education (see, for example,
Heckman & Masterov, 2007; Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000,
among others). It is generally argued that in addition to being
an extremely cost-effective investment in human capital,
quality preschool education helps to bridge the sociocultural
gaps that become evident very early in a child's life (Becker,
1993; Cunha & Heckman, 2007; Heckman, Krueger &
Friedman, 2003).
Recent initiatives launched in Chile, such as the Programa
Chile Crece Contigo (Chile Grows With You Program), aim
to guarantee the 40% most vulnerable sector of the popula-
tion access to day care or preschool (DC/PS) services (up to
the age of 4). Also, in the last few years, universal (although
not compulsory) access has been guaranteed for prekinder
and kindergarten children.
These initiatives imply important investments in logistics
and infrastructure, as well as the professional and technical
capabilities required in each center. For this reason, it is nec-
essary to avoid deficiencies in the services supplied, as this
results in an unnecessary increase of public spending in pre-
school education. This is extremely important because a
rational planning of spending on DC/PS centers generates
savings that could be used to extend this coverage to sectors
with difficulties of access and to improve the quality of the
services provided.
This calls for studies to provide an answer to several ques-
tions regarding the demand for these services on the part of
the homes. In this line, it is important to determine how the
distance between the home and the preschool center relates
to the way in which the families use this service. In addition
to the distance between the center and the home, there are
other factors associated with DC/PS use such as the age of
the child, the size of the household, the mother's educational
and employment status, and others, such as the household
member's interests or preferences. This study seeks to look
into these correlates as much as the data available allow by
estimating a model of the joint decision of child attendance
to the DC/PS center and mother's employment. The article
not only provides an answer to some of the basic questions
related to choice of day care centers in Chile but also raises
new questions and uncovers new issues that should be dealt
with in greater depth in subsequent studies.

Usage of Child Care and Education
Centers: The Proximity Factor
Francisca Dussaillant1
Abstract
The Chilean Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey was used to model the choices made by households with respect to day
care or preschool (DC/PS) attendance. We also use georeferenced data on the location of centers that could take care
of children. We present a detailed analysis of the correlates of DC/PS attendance choices, giving special attention to the
distance between the household and the center as predictors. For these purposes, the joint decision of child attendance to
DC/PS and mother's employment is modeled. The measurement of this association is relatively new to the literature because
it requires georeferenced data, which only recently have begun to be collected systematically by public policy agencies. The
association we find between distance and attendance to DC/PS centers is significant but smaller than the association to the
age of the child. Separate analyses for 0- to 14-month-olds and 25- to 54-month-olds show some heterogeneous effects on
the joint decision of attendance and education.

Literature Review
The objective of this analysis is to study the correlates of DC/
PS use by households. There is a well-established literature
that explores the determinants of child care, summarized by
Blau and Currie (2006).
The specific subject of the relation of child care and labor
supply has also been thoroughly examined. Anderson and
Levine (1999), Kalb (2009), and Del Boca (2015) provide
comprehensive reviews of that research literature.
Del Boca, Locatelli, and Vuri (2005) and Del Boca and
Vuri (2005) study the double decision of Italian mothers to
work and send their children to a formal child care center.
Both studies conclude that the most important factors that
affect this decision are the mother's educational level (the
higher her educational level, the greater the probability of
her working and using child care services, especially for
younger children), the age of the children (the probability
increases at the age of 4 or 5 years), factors related to the
family structure and home support networks, and so forth.
These results are frequently replicated in the specialized lit-
erature. For example, both Joesch and Hiedemann (2002)
and Reyes and Urzúa (2012) have found similar correlates of
preschool attendance, the former in the United States and the
latter in Chile.
It has been documented in various studies that the par-
ents' preferences of child preschool attendance vary accord-
ing to the child's age (see, for example, Del Boca et al.,
2005; Del Boca & Vuri, 2005; Joesch & Hiedemann, 2002;
Michalopoulos, Robins, & Garfinkel, 1992). Parents of
younger children tend to resort to informal child care strate-
gies (Hofferth, Brayfield, Deich, & Holcomb, 1991). This is
due to lower availability of formal centers, higher costs, or
the fact that families prefer informal arrangements in which
the caregiver is a family member or somebody that they trust
(Del Boca et al., 2005). Even in the United States, where
there is a wide supply of child care centers, Joesch and
Hiedemann (2002) have found that a considerable percent-
age of households with children below 3 years of age would
avoid child care centers, even if they were free of charge.
There are few studies that consider the effect of the loca-
tion of child care centers on the decision to send the children
to DC/PS establishments using georeferenced data. Kitano
and Uda (2007) studied the accessibility of child care centers
in two cities in Japan using georeferenced data of the loca-
tion of the centers and of the homes with children under 6
years of age, and data on transport and highways. Compton
and Pollak (2014) also argued that the mechanism through
which proximity increases labor supply is the availability of
child care. In their case, they study proximity to mothers and
mothers-in-law, as child care providers. The authors find
that, in the United States, the probability of employment and
labor force participation for married women with young chil-
dren is higher for those living closer to their mothers or their
mothers-in-law.
Herbst and Tekin (2012) have investigated the effect on
the actual reception of social services of the distance a parent
must cover to get to a social services agency in the United
States. Their results show that the greater the distance, the
lesser the child's probability of having access to a child care
subsidy.
The only study that examines location effects using geo-
referenced data in a developing country, as of our knowl-
edge, is Reyes and Urzúa (2012). They study the supply and
demand of early education using georeferential data of the
households and preschool education or child care centers in
the metropolitan region (a mostly urban geographical sector
of the country where the capital city, Santiago, is located).
They obtain the household information through data reported
in the Ficha de Protección Social (FPS), an instrument used
for the targeting of social benefits. The authors conclude that
the distance between the center and the home is an important
(although not the only) correlate of attendance. Although
parents do not necessarily choose the center that is the near-
est to their home, they do choose one that is close.
Another Chilean study (Contreras, Puentes, & Bravo,
2012) evaluates the association between distance from the
home or workplace to day care centers and the mother's deci-
sion to work. In this study, distance is measured subjectively
as perceived physical proximity. The authors find a correla-
tion between their distance variable and labor force partici-
pation of mothers.
Our study comes to complement Reyes and Urzúa (2012).
It differs from theirs in that we use national data from a rep-
resentative survey of early childhood, Estudio Longitudinal
de Primera Infancia (ELPI). As respondents of this survey
knew that their reports would be confidential and their names
would not be disclosed, they had less incentive to underre-
port on several key variables (a recognized problem of FPS
data). The use of FPS data by Reyes and Urzúa (2012) has
some advantage in that it includes the whole population, but
their universe is restricted to the metropolitan region and to
the households that had decided to give their information to
access social benefits. Herrera, Larrañaga and Telias (2010)
indicated that this population represented, as of 2010, more
than two thirds of the national population, and the group that
was left out was mostly the less vulnerable (which, as Reyes
& Urzúa state, are the less likely to use the public child care
and education services under study).
Institutional Structure of Preschool
Education and Care in Chile
Four preschool providers can be identified in the segment of
children younger than 5 years old: municipalities, private
providers, the Junta Nacional de Jardines Infantiles (JUNJI),
and the Fundación Integra. JUNJI is an autonomous organi-
zation related to the Ministry of Education, whose purpose is
to provide quality education and care to vulnerable children
Dussaillant 3
up to 4 years old. JUNJI also supervises and certifies other
public centers. Fundación Integra is a private provider of
care and education to children of ages younger than school
age, and it is fully financed by the government. Municipal
centers are autonomous organizations, and they are also
financed by the government. Finally, private centers are
payed by the families. Even though JUNJI and Fundación
Integra work without apparent association, they offer very
similar programs. They serve the bulk of the Chilean popula-
tion (Reyes & Urzúa, 2012).
In the last couple of years, there has been a significant
increase of the social protection programs oriented to early
childhood. In particular, in the period that goes from 2006 to
2010,1 preschool education and care services increased their
capacity by 113,000 places. This represented an increase of
almost 500% in the public supply of nursery facilities that
serve children from 0 to 24 months of age and an increase of
more than 50% of the public supply for children between 24
and 48 months of age. Nonetheless, this significant increase
in service availability did not consider supply and demand
issues in its planification, so several issues associated to the
quality of the services and their geographic location arose
(Reyes & Urzúa, 2012).
As of 2013, administrative records indicate that a little
less than 200,000 children were enrolled in these centers and
that most of them use JUNJI or Fundación Integra facilities.
Table 1 depicts total enrollment by type of provider, as
reported by the Chilean Ministry of Education for 2013
(Centro de Estudios MINEDUC, 2014). It should be beared
in mind that enrollment and total capacity do not necessarily
overlap in Chile (see, for example, Reyes & Urzúa, 2012),
where it is not rare to find DC/PS centers working in less
than full capacity due to a lack of demand. This will be later
discussed in this study.
Most DC/PS centers serve children of ages below 5. After
that, children enter the school system. Prekinder and kinder
are available in some schools and serve children during the
calendar year they turn 5 or 6 years of age, respectively.2
Kinder education was deemed mandatory in Chile since 2013.
This study focuses on children aged 0 to about 4.5 years
old from the birth cohorts of 2006 to the first half of 2009.
The eldest of these cohorts, born in 2006, would be ready to
enter prekinder in 2011. Thus, by 2010, when data used for
the analyses were gathered, these children mostly used the
services provided by DC/PS centers and not by schools. DC/
PS centers receive children of different ages and internally
divide the children into age-differentiated rooms. They fre-
quently serve children of every age, from birth until the
moment they enter school. There is no centralized curricu-
lum or directive regarding the services to be provided in
these centers. Some of them provide mostly day care,
whereas others start giving some education to the children.
Educational services come to replace pure day care when the
child grows, but the particular care/education time ratio at
different ages is a decision of each center. There are no data
about the type of service (care or education) provided in each
center, so we decided to pool them and give them all the
name of "DC/PS centers."
Data and Descriptive Analysis
This section will present a snapshot of preschool education
and child care in Chile obtained from the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study (ELPI in Spanish) that was conducted in
2010 to increase the information available on early child-
hood issues and to establish a baseline for a follow-up study
of a cohort.
The information was drawn from a representative sample
of each age range included in the survey to study the cohort
of children by year of birth, that is, the birth cohorts of 2006,
2007, 2008, and first half of 2009. The sample, which was
representative at the time of the survey, consisted of approxi-
mately 15,000 children born between January 1, 2006, and
August 31, 2009, residing in Chile throughout the country in
urban and rural areas. The estimated sample error for each
month of birth fluctuates between 5.0% and 5.7%; for a
12-month aggregate or a calendar year, it is around 1.5%, and
for the total sample, it decreases to less than 1.0%.

The database that was generated contains 15,175 sociode-
mographic questionnaires applied to the primary caregivers
of the children selected. Only one child per household was
selected.
For the purposes of this study, we used the ELPI sociode-
mographic database, which has the particular feature of col-
lating the children's "history"; that is, the questionnaire not
only refers to their current situation but also collects data
related to points or periods of time prior to the survey. Thus,
every child is described as a set of "moments" or ages: The
characteristics associated with the child vary according to the
"moment" recorded. However, especially when it comes to
attendance to DC/PS establishments, we have only consid-
ered the children at the "moment" corresponding to the inter-
view (excluding their history). This is due to the fact that
using the history of the child's attendance would lead to bias,
particularly considering that the supply of establishments has
increased dramatically in recent times.
The Ministry of Education also provided data about the
distance from 12,575 households surveyed by ELPI to the
government-funded education and child care centers ran by
the JUNJI and Fundación Integra. Only centers within a
radius of 10 km were matched to each household. Data about
the age range serviced by each center were also provided.
Two thousand six hundred cases were not matched because
there were no DC/PS centers in the 10-km radius or because
it was not possible for the ministry to georeferenciate them
(no information regarding which cases corresponded to the
first or second explanation was provided).
This means that in the descriptive sections of our study,
we were able to use about 83% of the original ELPI sample.
The 2,600 cases that were not matched are disproportion-
ally rural and belonged disproportionally to geographical
regions different from the metropolitan, where the capital
city, Santiago, is located. Therefore, 6.8% of the households
of the restricted sample are rural, whereas in the original
sample, the figure was 10.0%. Also, in the restricted sample,
42.1% of the households belonged to the metropolitan
region, whereas on the original sample, only 37.4% belonged
to that geographical zone. On other relevant variables, the
restricted and the original samples do not differ significantly.
For example, in the original sample, 35.3% of the children
assist to DC/PS centers, 44.5% of the mothers are employed,
mean child age is 30.4 months, and the average age of the
mother at childbirth was 27.3 years. In the restricted sample,
these figures change very subtly to 36.0%, 45.8%, 30.5%,
and 27.4%.
Our final statistical analysis, a bivariate probit that mod-
els the joint probability of a woman to work and use child
care facilities for her child, required further restriction of the
sample to 9,604 cases. This, due to missing values in the
labor status of the mother or, in a minority of cases, because
the main caretaker of the child was not the biological or
adoptive mother. Descriptive statistics of this estimation
sample are available in Table 2.
The following subsections aim to briefly describe the situ-
ation of females and their children in terms of labor, access
and use of child care, and the availability of child care and
education facilities near the households. These descriptive
analyses make use of the matched ELPI-distance database
described above (12,575 cases).
Maternal Employment, Child Age, and Child Care
Use
There is a direct relationship between the mother's employ-
ment status and the age of her children. The survey reveals
that when the selected child was under 12 months of age, less
than 35% of the mothers were employed. On the contrary,
when the children were between 4 and 5 years of age, this
proportion climbed to 52.1%. Maternal working hours do not
appear to vary by age of the child and are always about 40 to
41 hr on average per week, distributed over a 5-day working
week (with the exception of the 0- to 3-month-old age range,
in which some mothers do not report to work due to mater-
nity leave and the mothers of 4-year-olds that mostly report
full-time 45-hr jobs).
Our data show that in Chile, children of employed moth-
ers are more likely to attend preschool than those whose
mothers are not employed (see Figure 1). The difference is
more striking in the case of younger children (under 1 year of
age) and becomes less noticeable at successively older ages.

This may be indicating that preschool services are perceived
by mothers as instances of educational value for their chil-
dren, whereas mothers of young children would only regard
day care establishments as a child care solution. The respon-
dents who send their child to preschool or day care assess
these establishments quite positively (means are always
above 6.4 on a scale of 1-7) as regards infrastructure, cleanli-
ness, treatment of the children by their teachers, education
provided to the children, and schedules. The assessments do
not vary from item to item or according to the age range of
the child attending the center.
When mothers or caregivers who have decided not to
send the child to preschool establishments are asked why, the
answers provided are multiple but can be grouped into two
main types: those that arise from availability issues and oth-
ers that are explained by the preferences of the households.
Only the former can be regarded as an unmet demand. Table
2 gives an idea of the proportional size of that unmet demand
in Chile.
Respondents who say that they need a preschool center
but do not have access to one (because of distance, money,
availability, or schedule issues) are potential users if the sup-
ply is improved. When studying nonattendance of children
under 12 months of age, it appears that less than 4.5% report
such supply issues. This proportion slightly increases with
the age of the child to about 8.3% for 2-year-olds, 11.0% for
3-year-olds, and 13.5% for 4-year-olds. These results are in
line with those of Del Boca et al. (2005), Joesch and
Hiedemann (2002), and Hofferth et al. (1991).
The Distance Factor
We define as "potential DC/PS demanders" those households
that, although reporting a need of the service, say that they do
not have access to it. As Table 2 shows, although the highest
proportion of people who do not send their child to DC/PS
centers report doing so because they do not want to, the
group that indicates that their decision is due to supply issues
still represents a significant number of households. Most
(between 49% and 80%, according to age) of the households
that reported difficulties in terms of access specify as their
main constraint the distance to and from the facilities. This is
the most frequently mentioned reason in each age range,
although it is particularly significant for children between 4
and 5 years old.
To deepen our understanding of the association of the dis-
tance factor to the household decision of sending their child
to DC/PS centers, we study the data on the existence of a DC/
PS center3 within a 10-km radius of the household. The data
include the linear distance between the household and each
of these centers inside the 10-km radius, and the type of ser-
vices (in terms of age) they provide. Therefore, data made it
possible to match children with every center close to their
household that provided care for their age. If a 4-year-old
child was matched to 10 DC/PS centers in a 10-km radius,
we were sure that all these centers did attend 4-year-olds. On
the contrary, a nursery attending 0- to 2-year-olds was never
counted as a potential choice for these 4-year-olds, even if it
was located close to the household.
The number of establishments within a 10-km radius is, in
general, large, particularly in the metropolitan region (where
Santiago, the capital and most populated city, is located), due
to its greater population density. In this region, the house-
holds with children below a year of age have an average of
115.6 centers that attend to that age in the 10-km radius. This
number reduces to 82.6 when 4-year-olds are considered.
When the radius is narrowed to 2 km, the number of centers
descends to 8 for children below a year of age, and 5.4 for
4-year-olds. Unfortunately, this information does not allow
us to infer whether there are open vacancies.
Figure 1. Attendance to preschool or day care establishments according to maternal employment status.
6 SAGE Open
Table 3 shows the average distance between DC/PS cen-
ters in the area around the household. The table differentiates
between children who report attending DC/PS centers and
those not attending.
We see that children who attend DC/PS centers tend, on
average, to have facilities available at a shorter distance from
the household. This is particularly observable when we con-
sider the distance to the nearest facility and when children
are younger. However, it still remains valid when we com-
pare the third and fifth facilities nearest to the household.
The trend is reversed for the case of children between 4 and
5 years of age. This might be reflecting the fact that, in many
of these cases, these children already started attending the
prekinder and kinder supplied by public schools, establish-
ments not considered in the database.
However, the results on Table 3 refer only to average dis-
tances. Further analysis of the data shows that, at least for
younger ages, the distribution of distances for those attend-
ing DC/PS centers dominates stochastically the distribution
of distances for those not attending, regardless of whether we
look at the nearest, the third, or the fifth preschool establish-
ment in the distance ranking.
The relations between DC/PS attendance and distance
shown in Table 3 should be handled with caution. The asso-
ciations do not imply causality. They do not necessarily tell us
that increasing the number of establishments near households
would increase the proportion of mothers who decide to send
their child to these establishments. The association, as men-
tioned above, may have arisen because of the following:
a. The existence of DC/PS establishments near the
household induces the use of the available supply.
b. The sectors in which there is a larger proportion of
mothers willing to send their child to DC/PS centers
induce the installation of new establishments there.
It is quite likely that both phenomena are taking place,
and the data on Table 3 do not make it possible for us to dis-
cern which of either effect is stronger. If we were to assume,
for instance, that DC/PS centers were distributed throughout
the national territory at random, as a result of a central plan-
ning that does not take into account demand issues, then the
cause could be attributed to (a). However, even admitting
that the governmental plan to build new DC/PS centers was
not solely driven by considerations of demand, it is hard to
believe that there were no major local pressures (possibly
acknowledged by the government) in areas where such facil-
ities were more needed. In that sense, the effect described in
(b) should also be of some importance.
Econometric Analysis
We modeled the decisions of the selected children's mothers
about whether or not to opt for paid employment and whether
or not to send their children to day care centers or preschool.
Hence, the joint distribution model for the binary variables
"attends" and "employed" is constructed, where the former
indicates whether the child attends a DC/PS center and the
latter indicates whether the mother is employed or not4 by
using a bivariate probit. The joint model is appropriate when
the errors of each individual equation are not independent.5
Thus, the estimates describe the size and strength of the
association of the independent variables with the mother's
choice of employment, child care, or education.
Table 4 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample used
in this analysis. The independent variables include dummies
by geographical region, age of the child in months (and its
square), age of the mother when the child was born, number
of people in the household, education of the mother, distance
between the house and the nearest DC/PS center (providing
a service suitable to the age of the child), gender of the child,
and a dummy indicating whether the father lives in the
household. In the particular case of Chile, price does not
have a significant role in the decision to attend to DC/PS
centers because most centers are free. Therefore, we can
interpret in our results that the availability and distance vari-
ables represent what families perceive as the cost of sending
their child to a center.
It can be argued that the distance of DC/PS center from
home has a different meaning according to rurality. The same

distance can be perceived as very different if the household
is located in a big town (where traffic is an issue) or in the
countryside (where traffic is not an issue but access to pub-
lic transportation may be problematic). These heteroge-
neous effects are studied by separating the sample into two
groups: rural and urban households. Estimates for the whole
sample are also reported, including rurality as an indepen-
dent variable.
Another potential source of heterogeneity is the age of the
child. It can be argued that the essence of the DC/PS service,
from the point of view of the mother, is related to child care
for the smaller children, but to education and socialization
for the older. Therefore, we also perform separate estima-
tions for children up to 24 months old and for children from
25 to 54 months old.
The appendix shows the marginal effects calculated using
the models described above. Each column of TablesA1 toA3
represents the marginal effects on the probability of choosing
any combination of actions associated with employment
decisions and attendance to DC/PS establishments. For
example, the first column of each of the tables shows how
each one of the independent variables affects the joint prob-
ability of the mother being employed and the child being sent
to a DC/PS center.
Table 5, which we include in the main text, is a simpler
display of the effects6 of the independent variables on the
marginal probability of DC/PS attendance and on the employ-
ment decision of the mother.7 The table reports the results for
the whole sample estimation and for the urban and rural sam-
ples. Table 6 reports results for the age-specific samples. To
provide a benchmark for the reported marginal effects,
predictive margins and predicted joint probabilities in each
model are reported in Table 7. Also, in the same table, values
for the predicted conditional probability of employment given
that the child attends to a DC/PS center, and for the condi-
tional probability of attendance given that the mother is
employed, are provided.
The whole-sample model estimation of Table 6 shows
that each month in the child's life results in an increase of
1.7 percentage points in the probability of DC/PS atten-
dance and has an effect of 0.4 percentage points on the
mother's employment probability. Also, the older the
mother when the child was born, the lower the probability
of using DC/PS services, and the higher the probability of
her being employed, although the size of these effects is not
too large (0.3 percentage points per every year of age of the
mother in the case of probability of DC/PS attendance and
0.7 in that of the mother's employment probability).
Mothers with a college degree display the highest probabil-
ity of sending their children to DC/PS centers (and are also
the group with the highest employment) followed by those
with some level of higher education (complete or incom-
plete). Mothers with primary education or less have a prob-
ability of being employed that is 47 percentage points lower
than that of mothers with a university education. Also,
mothers with primary education or less send their children
to DC/PS centers with a frequency that is 17 percentage
points lower than that of mothers with a college education.
Distance to the nearest DC/PS center is decisive for the
household choice to use these services and an important
correlate in the employment decision of the mother. An
extra kilometer to the nearest DC/PS center is associated

with a decrease of more than 3 percentage points in the
probability of sending the child to the establishment and
results in lower probability of maternal employment (1.6
percentage points).8
When the father lives in the household, attendance to the
DC/PS center falls by almost 7 percentage points, as does the
probability of maternal employment, which decreases by
more than 15 percentage points. Similarly, the larger the
number of people living in the household, the lower the prob-
ability of the child attending the DC/PS center or the mother
being employed (an additional member of the household
makes the attendance probability decrease by 1.6 percentage
points and the maternal employment probability decreases
by 1.5 percentage points). The gender of the child does not
seem to be associated with the decision of the home.
If we consider the estimation for the whole sample, the
results indicate that the probability of using DC/PS services
in rural areas (with respect to urban) decreases by almost 9
percentage points and the probability of the mother of being
employed decreases by 7.2 points. Although there seems to
be some heterogeneity in the behavior of rural and urban
households, as seen in the separate estimations for the rural
and urban samples, estimated marginal effects are not sub-
stantially different. Nonetheless, several coefficients for the
rural sample deem insignificant (e.g., the marginal effect of
distance on the marginal probability of maternal employ-
ment). This may mean that the effect is absent, or it might
simply reflect the smaller size of the sample (N = 624) over
which the rural estimation was performed. Distance seems to
matter less in the decision to send the child to the DC/PS
center: Each extra kilometer of distance to the nearest center
is associated to a descent of 3.4 percentage points in the
probability to attend in urban zones but only 2.2 percentage
points in rural zones.
When the estimation is performed separately by age of
the child (see Table 6), there seems to be some indication of
heterogeneous response. Attendance decisions are more
associated to mother's education for older children. This
might be occurring due to a higher salience of the educa-
tional attributes of DC/PS services for older children, and

more educated mothers value more early education. On the
contrary, services for smaller children might be perceived to
be less educative and only related to day care and, therefore,
are similarly valued across educational groups. Distance
also seems to matter more for the probability of attending of
older children. These results are more difficult to interpret,
but they might be due to the fact that mothers sometime get
help from their employers to care for their 0- to 24-month-
old children (this is mandated by law for some employers).
Employer-provided centers are frequently located close to
the mother's workplace, and not necessarily to the child's
household. On the contrary, employers do provide DC/PS
centers for older children. Rurality also seems to work dif-
ferentially depending on the age of the child: The probabil-
ity of attending DC/PS centers is lower in rural areas only
for older children (by more than 13 percentage points).
Discussion and Conclusion
The analysis in this article indicates that a number of factors
are relevant when explaining the decision of households to
send their children to DC/PS centers. The analysis points to
the employment status of the mother as one of the main pre-
dictors of the use of preschool services (especially for younger
children). This is evident from our analysis in that the correla-
tion between the errors of the attendance equation and the
employment equation of the bivariate probits ranges from .30
to .48 depending on the sample over which the estimation was
performed. As would be expected, the higher correlations
were found for the estimation over the sample restricted to
0- to 24-month-olds. This implies that in a country where
female employment is on the rise, an increase in demand for
day care and preschool establishments is to be expected.

Another very important correlate of the demand for DC/PS
centers is the age of the child. Our estimates indicate that there
is evidence of heterogeneous response in the decision to send
older versus younger children to DC/PS centers in Chile.
Attendance is significantly more associated to education of the
mother and to rurality when the child is older (25 to 54 months
old). Distance to the nearest DC/PS center also seems to mat-
ter most in households of older children. Some explanations
can be ventured for these results, although more research
would be needed to check whether these hypotheses are cor-
rect. The fact that attendance decisions are more associated to
mother's education for older children might be due to a higher
salience of the educational attributes of DC/PS services for
older children, as more educated mothers value more early
education. Services for smaller children might be perceived to
be less educative and only related to day care and, therefore,
are similarly valued across educational groups. The fact that
distance to the nearest DC/PS center seems to be more associ-
ated to the probability of attending of older children is more
difficult to interpret. One reason might be the fact that there is
a law that mandates some employers to help Chilean mothers
by proving or financing child care for their 0- to 24-month-old
children. But employer-provided centers are frequently located
close to the mother's workplace, and not necessarily to the
child's household. There is no legal mandate for Chilean
employers to provide DC/PS centers for older children.
Distance from the household to the nearest the DC/PS
establishment relates to the mothers' decision to send their
children to these establishments and shows a variation of
around 3 percentage points in the attendance rate. The mea-
surement of this effect is relatively new to the literature as it
requires georeferenced data, which only recently have begun
to be collected systematically by public policy agencies. The
association we find between distance and attendance to DC/
PS centers is significant but smaller than that which relates
attendance to the age of the child or education of the mother.
Unfortunately, we have no information on the distance
between the DC/PS establishment and the workplace of the
mother. This leads us to think that the distance effect esti-
mated here is only partial. There may be a stronger associa-
tion when the "mother­child distance" and not the decision
to send the child to the DC/PS center are considered. This
proposed "mother­child distance" variable, however, is dif-
ferent from the "household­child distance" variable, which
is the one used in this estimation, because the mother is not
necessarily at home during the day. If we had such data, we
would expect, if anything, an increase in the strength of the
association between distance and child attendance. It is inter-
esting that the relationship is still showing, even considering
the abovementioned drawbacks.

Notes
1. That period's institutional circumstances are of special rel-
evance because this study examines data gathered in 2011.
2. In Chile, calendar and academic years overlap. The Chilean
academic year commences in March and ends in December.
3. Most government-funded centers were included in the data-
base, with the exception of a small percentage of centers
belonging to municipalities. Private centers were not identified
either, but most children attend government-funded facilities
because they are free of charge.
4. The estimates were based on the subsample of children living
with their biological or adoptive mothers (a majority).
5. In fact, in the estimation of the bivariate probit, a .30 to .49
(p < .01) correlation was obtained between the errors of the
attendance equation and the employment equation. The small-
est corresponded to the estimation for the sample of older chil-
dren, and the highest to that of the sample of older children.
6. Throughout this document, "effects" should be understood as
the marginal effects of a variable on the probability of attend-
ing day care/preschool (DC/PS) centers or on that of the mother
being employed. A marginal effect indicates how the probabil-
ity varies if the variable in question is modified by one unit.
7. It should be borne in mind that according to the Bayes's
rule, the joint probability P(A, E), where A = attends and E
= employed breaks down into P(A/E)xP(E) or into P(E/A)
xP(A), where P(A/E) and P(E/A) are conditional probabilities
and P(A) and P(E) are marginal probabilities. Thus, the afore-
mentioned table shows the marginal effects on the marginal
attendance probability P(A), where P(A) = P(A/E = 1)xP(E =
1) + P(A/E = 0)xP(E = 0) and, similarly, for the employment
probability P(E).
8. This relation, as well as all the ones estimated, does not imply
causality. In this particular case, for instance, we cannot con-
clude that a larger number of DC/PS establishments near the
household would lead to a greater use of them: It is possible
that the relation observed occurs because in areas more willing
to send children to these centers, there are more of them.
