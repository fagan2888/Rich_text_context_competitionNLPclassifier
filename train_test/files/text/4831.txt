Abstract
Objective: To explore the correlation between blood pressure in the supine position and target
organ damage in subjects over 60 years of age.
Methods: In 2444 individuals, we investigated the association of systolic blood pressure (SBP) in
the supine position with the target organ damage indices microalbuminuria (ALBU), brachial­ankle
pulse wave velocity (baPWV), and carotid intima­media thickness (IMT). Supine hypertension (SH)
is defined as systolic blood pressure ! 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ! 90 mmHg.
Subjects were assigned to either the SH group (1275 cases) or the non-SH group (1169 cases).
Results: The levels of ALBU, baPWV, and IMT, as well as the percentage of participants with
ALBU > 30 mg/L, baPWV ! 1400 cm/s, and IMT ! 1 mm, were significantly higher in the SH group
than in the non-SH group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that SH was an
independent risk factor for baPWV and IMT, but the relationship with ALBU was not statistically
significant after correction for confounding factors.
Conclusions: SH is a risk factor for target organ damage, as expressed by the indices baPWV and
IMT. The association of SH with kidney damage requires further study.

Introduction
Blood pressure can be categorized as sitting,
supine, or orthostatic according to the pos-
ition of measurement. Notable differences
have been observed between sitting and
supine blood pressures,1 and human bodies
spend one-third of the time in the supine
position. Clinical practice and related
research often use sitting blood pressure to
diagnose hypertension, whereas less atten-
tion has been paid to supine blood pressure
or supine hypertension (SH). SH is defined
as systolic blood pressure (SBP) !
140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure
(DBP) ! 90 mmHg.2 The incidence of SH in
patients with autonomic failure is approxi-
mately 50%.3
Previous studies have demonstrated that
hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascu-
lar dysfunction and is closely related to the
onset of chronic kidney disease,4 atheroscler-
osis,5 arteriosclerosis,6 and other target organ
damage. However, the aforementioned stu-
dies were mostly based on sitting clinic7,8 or
home blood pressure,9,10 or 24-h ambulatory
monitoring.10­12 Although studies have
reported that SH is closely related to kidney
damage (glomerular filtration rate)13,14 and
left ventricular hypertrophy,15 research was
based on relatively small sample populations.
Very few large-scale studies have analysed
both SH and target-organ damage indices,
such as microalbuminuria (ALBU), bra-
chial­ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV),
and carotid intima­media thickness (IMT).
Therefore, this study evaluated data collected
from Kailuan General Hospital (registration
number: chiCTR-TNC-1100 1489) and
examined the association of SH and indices
of target-organ damage (ALBU, baPWW,
and IMT) in subjects over 60 years of age.
Materials and methods
Study population
From 2006 to 2007, data were collected
from the health examinations of cur-
rent and retired employees of Kailuan
Group at 11 hospitals, including Kailuan
General Hospital, Kailuan Linxi
Hospital, Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Hospital,
Kailuan Tangjiazhuang Hospital, Kailuan
Fangezhuang Hospital, Kailuan Lujiatuo
Hospital, Kailuan Jinggezhuang Hospital,
Kailuan Linnancang Hospital, Kailuan
Qianjiaing Hospital, Kailuan Majiagou
Hospital, and Kailuan rehabilitation hos-
pital. The same group of employees under-
went two more examinations in 2008­2009
and 2010­2011, conducted by the same
medical staff as at the first examination, at
the same locations, and with the same time
sequence, questionnaire, and anthropomet-
ric and biochemical analysis methods as in
the first health examination.
During the third health examination,
retired employees of Kailuan Group
( ! 60 years old) who underwent their exam-
inations at Kailuan General Hospital,
Kailuan Linxi Hospital, or Kailuan
Zhaogezhuang Hospital were selected as
study candidates by cluster sampling, with
25% of the population being selected at
random. The study subjects underwent
physical examinations and, with their
consent, rescheduled a new appointment
(the third þ health examination) for blood
pressure measurement in different positions,
ultrasound examination of cervical blood
vessels, 24-h ambulatory blood pressure
monitoring, pulse wave velocity examin-
ation, and urinary microprotein detection.
The study was approved by the ethics com-
mittees of Kailuan Group Hospital.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria: 1. retired workers ! 60
years of age who underwent their health
examinations at the Kailuan General
Hospital, Kailuan Linxi Hospital, or
Kailuan Zhaogezhuang Hospital; 2. subjects
without severe disabilities who could stand
and walk in examinations by themselves; 3.
subjects without defects in cognitive ability
who could complete the questionnaire;
and 4. subjects who agreed to participate
in the study and provided signed informed
consent.
Exclusion criteria: 1. valvular heart dis-
ease or cardiomyopathy; 2. frequent prema-
ture beats (all types of beats > 6 times/min);
3. atrial fibrillation, or atrioventricular
or intraventricular conduction block; and
4. exposure to antipsychotic drugs, anti-
Parkinson drugs, antidepressants, or seda-
tive drugs within the previous 2 weeks.
Data collection
The content of the epidemiological survey,
anthropometric indicators, and biochemical
testing methods used in the current study can
be found in our previous study.16 Smoking
was defined as at least one cigarette per day
on average for at least 1 year; drinking was
defined as drinking at least 100 mL of liquor
(>50% alcohol content) per day on average
for at least 1 year; and exercise was defined as
aerobic activities (e.g., walking, jogging, ball
games, swimming) at least three times a week
for at least 30 minutes.
Sitting and supine blood pressure
measurements
During the third þ health examination,
blood pressure was measured after subjects
had been sitting calmly for 15 min and had
refrained from smoking or consuming tea or
coffee for 30 min before measurement.
A calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer
(Yuwell, Yuyue, Jiangsu, China) was used to
measure blood pressure in the right brachial
artery, with systolic SBP readings taken at
the first and DBP readings at the fifth
Korotkoff sound. Blood pressure was mea-
sured three consecutive times at intervals of
1­2 min, and the average value was
recorded. Subjects were then asked to
adopt the supine position, and the right
brachial pressure was measured by trained
and certified observers after 5 min. Blood
pressure measurements were obtained
according to a standard protocol recom-
mended by the American Heart
Association.29 The diagnostic criteria for
sitting hypertension were SBP ! 140 mmHg
and/or DBP! 90 mmHg, a history of hyper-
tension, or a diagnosis of hypertension and
the taking of related medication. The diag-
nostic criteria for SH were SBP ! 140 mmHg
and/or DBP ! 90 mmHg.
Laboratory testing
On the morning of the third examination,
after fasting for 8 h, 5 mL of venous blood
was collected from each subject into a
vacuum tube and centrifuged at 3000 g for
10 min at room temperature (24C), with
upper serum collected for measurement
within 4 h. Clinical laboratories measured
serum creatinine levels by the colourimetric
method using a liquid double dosage form
creatinine assay kit manufactured by
Beikong Biotechnology Co., Ltd (produc-
tion batch number: 150203; batch variation
coefficient < 5%; Changping, China).
Analysis of other biochemical parameters,
including fasting blood glucose (FBG), low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C),
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP), was conducted on a Hitachi auto-
matic analyser (7600 Automatic Analyzer;
Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). From the
third þ physical examination onwards,
ALBU was measured using the Uppergold
U2 quantitative reader manufactured by
(Shanghai Upper Bio-Tech Pharmaceutical
Wang et al. 125
Co. Ltd., Shanghai, China). In this study,
increased ALBU was defined as
ALBU ! 30 mg/L.17
Brachial­ankle pulse wave velocity
From the third þ physical examination
onwards, baPWV was measured using a BP-
203RPE3 noninvasive vascular screening
device (Omron Healthcare Co. Ltd, Tokyo,
Japan). The data were read directly via net-
work connections. The examination room
temperature was maintained in the range
22­25 C. The participant was requested not
to smoke prior to the examination and had
rested for at least 5 min. The pillow was
removed to ensure a supine posture, with
palms facing up and placed at the sides of the
body. Sphygmomanometer cuffs were
wrapped around the upper arms and the
lower ankles. The label of the upper arm cuff
was alignedwith the brachial arteries, with the
lower edge of the cuff 2­3 cm from the cubital
fossa strips. The label of the lower limb cuff
was positioned on the medial side of the leg,
withtheloweredgeof the cuff 1­2 cmfrom the
malleolus. A phonocardiography transducer
was placed over the precordium.
Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes were
clipped to the left and the right wrists. Two
measurementsweretakenperparticipant,and
the second measurement was used as the final
result. This study used the greater of the
baPWV values of the left and right sides for
further analyses.18
Carotid artery intima­media thickness
From the third þ physical examination
onwards, test participants were examined by
physicians with more than 5 years of clinical
experience in ultrasonography and who had
undergone the standard training. A Philips
HD-15 colour ultrasound diagnostic
apparatus (Koninklijke Philips Electronics,
Amsterdam, Netherlands) with a 5­12MHz
high-frequency probe was used for the
measurement. The test participant assumed
the supine position with the head turned
toward the contralateral side from the exam-
ination. In the 1­2 cm segment at the end of
the left and the right common carotid artery,
IMT was measured in the longitudinal section
of the rear wall (to avoid plaque). One person
operated the apparatus and the other rec-
orded the results. After the two physicians
had confirmed their observations, detailed
results were recorded. In accordance with the
method of Hedblad et al.,19 the larger of the
values for the left and the right common
carotid artery was used for analyses. A
common carotid IMT ! 1.00mm was defined
as an increase in IMT.
Statistical analyses
The annual physical examination data from
the years 2006­2007, 2008­2009, and 2010­
2011 were obtained from the hospitals that
performed the examinations. These data were
uploaded via network to the Kailuan General
Hospital server room and stored in an Oracle
10.2 g database. SPSS 13.0 statistical software
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for
the statistical analyses. Normally distributed
data were expressed as meanÆ standard
deviation. The t-test was used to compare
data between two groups. Measurement data
that formed a skewed distribution were
analysed by t-test after logarithmic conver-
sion. Count data were presented as n (%) and
differences between groups were evaluated
using the 2 test. Rank-correlation analysis
was used to test for correlations between SBP
and ALBU, baPWV, and IMT. Multivariate
logistic regression was used to analyse the
influence of SH on ALBU, baPWV, and
IMT. P < 0.05 (bilateral) was considered
statistically significant throughout.
Results
A total of 12,257 individuals (aged ! 60
years, and retired), accounting for 52.67%
126 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
of total retirees aged ! 60 years who had
three physical examinations in Kailuan
Group, underwent physical examinations
at the three aforementioned hospitals. Of
these, 3064 (25% of the total) were screened
and 2860 subjects agreed to participate in
this research (response rate: 93.34%).
However, 46 volunteers dropped out for
a variety of reasons, leaving 2814
(actual response rate: 91.84%), of whom
350 met the exclusion criteria and
were excluded. Thus, the actual cohort
comprised 2464 participants. Of these,
13 participants lacked SBP data and 7 had
no DBP data, leaving a total of 2444 partici-
pants with complete blood pressure data.
General characteristics
The 2444 participants had a mean age of
67.40 years and included 1656 males.
The age, supine/sitting SBP and DBP,
supine heart rate, body mass index (BMI),
FBG, log-converted (Lg) triglyceride (TG),
Lg hsCRP, LDL-C, number of males, alco-
hol consumption, and percentage of partici-
pants taking antihypertensive medications
were significantly higher in the SH group
than in the non-SH group (P < 0.05). The
differences in the proportion of smokers and
exercisers between the SH group and the
non-SH group were not statistically signifi-
cant (Table 1).
Target organ damage indices
For the 2444 participants, the average
levels of ALBU, baPWV, and IMT were
28.30 mg/L, 1795.95 cm/s, and 0.92 mm,
respectively. The levels of ALBU, baPWV,
and IMT, as well as the percentage
of participants with ALBU > 30 mg/L,

with ALBU, baPW, and IMT (P < 0.05).
FBG and the use of antihypertensive medi-
cations were positively correlated with
ALBU and baPWV (P < 0.01). hsCRP
levels were positively correlated with
ALBU and IMT (P < 0.05). Age was posi-
tively correlated with baPWV and IMT
(Table 3).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis of
factors influencing target organ damage
indices
Model 1 assumed ALBU, baPWV, IMT as
dependent variables and SH as the inde-
pendent variable. Nonconditional logistic
regression analysis was carried out to deter-
mine the effect of SH on ALBU, baPWV,
and IMT. The results indicated that SH was
a risk factor for ALBU, baPWV, and
increased IMT. Model 2 was based on
Model 1, with corrections for age and sex
(male/female). The results showed that SH
was a risk factor for ALBU, baPWV, and
increased IMT. Model 3 was based on
Model 2, with corrections for sitting SBP,
sitting DBP, supine heart rate, BMI, FBG,
LDL-C, TG, hsCRP, smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, exercise, and use of antihyperten-
sive medications. The findings indicated that
SH was a risk factor for baPWV and
increased IMT (P < 0.05), but the correlation
between SH and ALBU after correction for
associated factors was not statistically sig-
nificant. The odds ratios (OR) were 5.15
(95% CI: 3.43­7.73), 1.47 (95% CI: 1.17­
1.87), and 1.34 (95% CI: 0.99­1.82), respect-
ively (Table 4).
Discussion
We demonstrated an association between
SH and the indices of target organ damage
ALBU, baPWV, and IMT in a large sample
of subjects aged over 60 years. During
the measurement of supine blood pressure,
individuals are relatively relaxed, which
may largely reflect real blood pressures.
In addition, the reduced venous return and
relatively stable hormone levels observed in
vivo in the supine position can lead to more
accurate blood pressure measurements.30
Garland et al.14 studied 65 cases of elderly
patients with autonomic failure and found

that SH was related to reduced glomerular
filtration rate. Cuspidi et al.20 studied 343
untreated hypertension patients, among
whom the number with left ventricular
hypertrophy was three times greater in the
nighttime SH group than in the group with
normal nighttime blood pressure. However,
these studies of the relationship between SH
and target organ damage involved relatively
small populations.
In the present study, the occurrence rate
of target organ damage and the average
values of ALBU, baPWV, and IMT were
higher in the SH group than in the non-SH
group, while supine SBP was positively
correlated with ALBU, baPWV, and IMT.
To date, most studies have focused on
nighttime blood pressure in 24-h ambula-
tory blood pressure monitoring in relation
to target organs,10­12,20,21 whereas daytime
supine blood pressure affecting target organ
damage has been largely overlooked.
Cuspidi et al.20 found evidence that night-
time supine SBP in 343 hypertensive patients
was positively correlated with IMT
(r ¼ 0.22, P ¼ 0.01). Ozawa et al.21 reported
a positive linear correlation between night-
time supine SBP and baPWV (b ¼ 0.297,
P < 0.01) in elderly hypertensive patients.
These results confirmed the strong correl-
ation between supine SBP and target organ
damage.
In addition, in the present study, multi-
variate logistic regression analysis showed
that SH was a risk factor for target organ
damage, as reflected by various indices.
Sharabi et al.22 observed that, in patients
with autonomic failure, SH increased the
risk of chronic renal failure, while de la
Sierra et al.23 reported that nighttime SH
was a risk factor for positive urinary protein
(OR ¼ 1.021; 95% CI: 1.012­1.029).
Chatzistamatiou et al.24 studied 182 cases
of untreated hypertensive patients and
found that patients in the SH group had a
higher average carotid­femoral pulse wave
velocity (cfPWV) value and greater IMT
compared with patients in the non-SH group
(cfPWV: 8.6 Æ 1.6 m/s vs. 7.9 Æ 1.4 m/s,
P ¼ 0.009; IMT: 0.74 Æ 0.17 mm vs. 0.68 Æ
0.15 mm, P ¼ 0.007). Androulakis et al.25
studied 319 hypertensive patients and found
that nighttime SH was strongly associated
with target organ damage (cfPWV, IMT,
and left ventricular hypertrophy). These
results suggest that SH and target organ
damage are closely related. Our study dem-
onstrates that SH is closely associated with
vascular function and structural changes,
although the relationship between SH and
renal damage remains to be further studied.
Other studies have indicated that SH is a
risk factor for kidney damage, left ventricu-
lar hypertrophy, and other target organ
damage.13­15 Kikuya et al.26 followed 1332
healthy individuals over 10.8 years old and
found that nighttime supine blood pressure
was a better predictor of cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality than daytime blood pressure.
Our study has added to the evidence that
SH has a relationship with the risk for target
organ damage, given that sitting hyperten-
sion has previously been shown to be a risk
factor for target organ damage. With an
aging population and increased incidence of
stroke in China,31 our results can be used for
evaluating the health of patients lying in
bed. Because of the cross-sectional design of
our study, we could not establish a causal
relationship between SH and target organ
damage. However, based on previous stu-
dies, we can infer that as supine blood
pressure increases, hormone levels also
change.27 Hence, the sympathetic nervous
system is stimulated, which leads to elevated
levels of vasoconstrictor substances such as
catecholamines, and vascular resistance
increases in turn.14 Consequently, glomerular
perfusion decreases, renal dysfunction is
aggravated, and the resulting abnormal leak-
age of protein may result in increased ALBU.
Furthermore, SH often occurs in patients
with autonomic failure.3,14 Previous stu-
dies14 showed that, in these patients, the
130 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
tension of the postganglionic sympathetic
nerve increases, the regulatory function of
the pressure sensor decreases significantly,
and the arterial structure could also change.
Changes in arterial structure are often pre-
sented as an increase in the wall-to-lumen
ratio. Atrial wall thickening results in
increased arterial stiffness, which can lead
to increased baPWV and IMT. The inverse
relationship should also be considered.
ALBU is an independent risk factor for
vascular damage,28 and an increase in
ALBU leads to increased arterial stiffness.
Increases in baPWV and IMT also suggest
increased arterial stiffness. As arterial stiff-
ness increases, the regulatory function of the
pressure sensors inside the artery wall will
be affected, which in turn increases supine
blood pressure.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, it was
a cross-sectional study, so it could not
establish a causal relationship between SH
and target organ damage. However, very
few previous studies have investigated the
association between supine blood pressure
and target organ damage in a large sample
of the late middle-aged population. Second,
our participants were predominantly male,
which might have had an impact on our
results. In addition, our results apply only to
subjects over 60 years old. Further investi-
gation will be required to determine whether
our results can be extended to other popu-
lation groups. Nevertheless, this study is
instructive with respect to blood pressure
management and the prevention of subclin-
ical target organ damage in subjects over
60 years old.
Conclusions
Our study demonstrates that SH is a risk
factor for target organ damage, as deter-
mined by the indices baPWV and IMT, in
subjects over 60 years old. The association
of SH with ALBU and kidney damage
requires further study. While adding to our
knowledge of the relationship between
blood pressure and target organ damage,
the study also underlines the importance of
supine blood pressure in evaluating and
possibly reducing subclinical target organ
damage. However, further studies will be
required to confirm the replicability of our
results and to determine whether they can be
extrapolated to a wider population.
