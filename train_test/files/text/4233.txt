Abstract
Objective: To investigate the relationship between hyperuricemia and coronary heart disease
(CHD) risk based on the Framingham risk score (FRS) in a middle-aged and elderly Chinese
population.
Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients undergoing routine check-ups at Xiangya
Hospital between October 2013 and November 2014. Hyperuricemia was defined as uric acid
!416 mmol/l for males and !360 mmol/l for females. A 10-year CHD risk was calculated from FRS.
A multivariable logistic analysis model was used to evaluate associations.
Results: Of the 6347 patients, 3415 (53.8%) were male, 1543 (24.3%) had a CHD risk !10%
(i.e. intermediate and high risk) and the prevalence of hyperuricemia was 18.1% (n ¼ 1148). After
adjusting for potential confounding factors, the 10-year CHD risk was increased in patients with
hyperuricemia compared with those without hyperuricemia by 0.28 times in the total population
(odds ratio [OR] 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09, 1.48), by 0.25 times in the male
population (OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.06, 1.47) and by 2.76 times in the female population (OR 3.76; 95%
CI 2.08, 6.79).
Conclusion: Hyperuricemia was positively associated with a 10-year risk of CHD suggesting that
it might be an independent CHD risk factor in middle-aged and elderly individuals.

Introduction
The prevalence of hyperuricemia has been
increasing worldwide over recent years.1,2 In
several Asian countries, the prevalence of
hyperuricemia has been estimated to range
from 13% to 26%.3 Moreover, a study in
Taiwanese aboriginals found the prevalence
of hyperuricemia to be approximately 41%.1
Several studies have suggested that hyper-
uricemia is strongly associated with a
number of cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk factors.4­7 In addition, research from
Korea showed that an increase in serum uric
acid concentration was associated with an
increased Framingham risk score (FRS).8,9
The FRS provides an integrated estimated
risk of an individual developing coronary
heart disease (CHD) over the next 10 years
based on a set of known CVD risk factors.8
Importantly, a meta-analysis of 26 studies
demonstrated that hyperuricemia may mar-
ginally increase the risk of CHD events
independently of traditional CHD risk fac-
tors.10 However, the meta-analysis only
included studies from Taiwan. To the best
of our knowledge, no large-scale studies
have investigated the association between
hyperuricemia and the risk of CHD based
on FRS in a Chinese mainland population.
Therefore, a cross-sectional study was
undertaken to assess the relationship
between hyperuricemia and the risk of
CHD calculated from the FRS.
Patients and methods
Study population
This cross-sectional study included patients
who were undergoing routine check-ups at
the Health Examination Centre in Xiangya
Hospital, Central South University,
Changsha, Hunan Province, China between
October 2013 and November 2014.
Participants were selected according to the
following inclusion criteria: (i) aged 40 years
or older; (ii) serum uric acid and other basic
biochemical measurements available; (iii)
availability of data on all basic characteris-
tics, including age, sex and body mass index
(BMI); and (iv) availability of data on
health-related habits, such as smoking
status, alcohol consumption, activity level,
and medication use. The study design has
been previously published.11 Using a stan-
dardized questionnaire, independent, regis-
tered nurses interviewed all participants and
collected information on demographic char-
acteristics and health-related habits. The
protocol of this study was reviewed and
approved by the Ethics and Research
Committee of Xiangya Hospital (no.
201312459). Verbal informed consent was
obtained from each participant.
Blood biochemistry
All blood samples were drawn after a 12-h
overnight fast and were kept at 4C until
analysis. Hyperuricemia was defined by the
uric acid level !416 mmol/l in males and
!360 mmol/l in females. Blood fasting glu-
cose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) and triglyceride levels were
also measured. The inter- and intra-assay
coefficients of variation were tested by low
concentrations (2.5 mmol/l for glucose and
118 mmol/l for uric acid) and high concen-
trations (6.7 mmol/l for glucose and
472 mmol/l for uric acid) of standard
human samples. The intra-assay coefficients
of variation were 0.98% (2.5 mmol/l) and
1.72% (6.7 mmol/l) for glucose, 1.39%
Yang et al. 255
(118 mmol/l) and 0.41% (472 mmol/l) for uric
acid. The inter-assay coefficients of variation
were 2.45% (2.5 mmol/l) and 1.46%
(6.7 mmol/l) for glucose, 1.40% (118 mmol/
l) and 1.23% (472 mmol/l) for uric acid.
Patients with a fasting glucose !7.0 mmol/l
or who were currently undergoing drug
treatment for blood glucose control were
regarded as having diabetes mellitus.
Laboratory tests were performed with a
Beckman Coulter AU5800 analyser
(Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA).
Assessment of other exposures
The weight and height of each patient was
measured to calculate BMI. Blood pressure
was measured with an electronic sphygmo-
manometer. In addition, participants were
asked about their average frequency of
physical activity (i.e. never, one to two
times per week, three to four times per
week, five times and above per week), aver-
age duration of physical activity (i.e. half an
hour or less, half an hour to 1 h, 1­2 h, more
than 2 h). Smoking, alcohol consumption,
educational background, occupation and
medication status were ascertained by
interview.
Assessment of 10-Year Risk for
Coronary Heart Disease
Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) charts
were used to calculate the FRS for each
participant.8 Information included in the risk
assessment tool included age, sex, smoking,
systolic blood pressure, use of antihyperten-
sive medications, presence of diabetes
mellitus, total cholesterol and HDL-C.
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were expressed as
mean Æ SD and categorical data were
expressed as n of patients (%). Differences
in continuous data were evaluated by
one-way analysis of variance for normally
distributed data or Kruskal­Wallis H test
for not normally distributed data.
Differences in categorical data were assessed
by the 2-test. Patients were classified into
two categories based on their 10-year CHD
risk: 0­9% (low risk) and !10% (intermedi-
ate/high risk). The prevalence of intermedi-
ate/high CHD risk scores were compared
between patients with and without hyperur-
icemia. The unadjusted association between
hyperuricemia and CHD risk was first
examined by a logistic regression. Then a
multivariable model including variables for
age, BMI, creatinine level, activity level,
alcohol consumption, educational back-
ground, occupation, and diabetes status
was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR)
and related 95% confidence interval (CI).
Subgroup analyses were conducted in the
male and female populations.
Sensitivity analyses were performed
firstly by excluding patients with diabetes,
hypolipaemic medication history or chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and secondly, by
adding LDL-C and triglycerides into the
multivariable adjusted model. All statistical
analyses were performed using the IBM
SPSSÕ statistical package, version 19.0
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) for
WindowsÕ. A P-value < 0.05 (2-tailed)
was considered to indicate statistical
significance.
Results
Of the 13 562 patients aged 40 years or older
who were initially screened for this cross-
sectional study, information on health-
related habits was available for 6347
patients who were therefore eligible for the
study. The mean Æ SD age of the group was
53.0 Æ 7.5 years; and 53.8% (3415 of 6347)
of the participants were male and 2932 of
6347 (46.2%) were female. Baseline charac-
teristics of the study population are shown
in Table 1. The proportion of patients with
256 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
CHD risk !10% (i.e. intermediate and high
risk) was 24.3% (1543 of 6347) and the
prevalence of hyperuricemia in the total
population was 18.1% (1148 of 6347).
There were statistically significant differ-
ences between the patients in the intermedi-
ate/high CHD risk group (!10%) compared
with those in the low risk CHD group (0­
9%) in terms of age, BMI, total cholesterol,
HDL-C, LDL-C, triglyceride, blood pres-
sure, creatinine, smoking status, alcohol
consumption, diabetes ratio, educational
background, and occupation (Table 1)
(P < 0.01 for all comparisons).
Unadjusted associations were observed
between hyperuricemia and 10-year CHD
risk in the total population and in the
male and female subgroups (Table 2).
After adjusting for potential confounding
factors, significant positive associations
were still evident. The 10-year CHD risk
was increased in patients with hyperuricemia
compared with patients without hyperurice-
mia by 0.28 times in the total population
(OR 1.28; 95% CI 1.09, 1.48; P < 0.01), by
0.25 times in the male population (OR 1.25;
95% CI 1.06, 1.47; P ¼ 0.01), and by 2.76
times in the female population (OR 3.76;
95% CI 2.08, 6.79; P < 0.01).
Sensitivity analyses suggested similar
results after excluding patients with diabetes
mellitus, hypolipaemic medication history
or chronic kidney disease. For the total
population, the positive association between
hyperuricemia and 10-year CHD risk was
significant (OR 1.69; 95% CI 1.46, 1.95;

Discussion
The results of this present study showed that
hyperuricemia is positively associated with
the 10-year risk of CHD calculated using
FRS and independent of some potential
confounding factors (i.e. age, BMI, creatin-
ine, activity level, alcohol consumption,
educational background, occupation, and
diabetes status). The relationship was valid
for both the male and female subgroups. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study to examine the correlation between
hyperuricemia and CHD risk based on FRS
in a middle-aged to elderly Chinese
population.
Uric acid is the metabolic end product of
purine metabolism.12 It has been described
as having both an extracellular antioxidant
effect and an intracellular pro-oxidant effect
depending on locality and presence of other
factors.12 This dual role has been described
as the `uric acid paradox'.12 For example,
low concentrations of uric acid contribute to
the prevention of oxidative inactivation of
endothelial enzymes and angiotensin con-
verting enzyme and also to the preservation
of nitrous oxide (NO) production.13
However, under hyperuricemic conditions,
the beneficial effects are replaced by dele-
terious effects that include NO reduction,
endothelial dysfunction,14 oxygen radical
promotion and increased proinflammatory
marker production.15
Although the exact mechanisms are
unclear, several studies have shown that
hyperuricemia is associated with CHD and
is independently associated with some CHD
risk factors.9,16,17 Possible causes include
damage to the vascular endothelium and
vessel wall because, as previously men-
tioned, uric acid can exert a pro-oxidant
effect and oxidative stress would promote
endothelial dysfunction.14,18 In addition,
uric acid stimulates the proliferation of
vascular smooth muscle cells through the
renin-angiotensin system and its activation
could lead in turn to the stimulation of the
xanthine oxidase and nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate systems.19,20 This
phenomenon could possibly impair arterial
function and cause arterial stiffening, which
is a major cause of hypertension and
CHD.12 Another possible explanation of
the involvement of uric acid in CHD is

impaired kidney function.21 Elevated serum
uric acid is a characteristic of CKD and
decreased glomerular filtration rate and
increased albuminuria, which are both com-
ponents of CKD, can potentiate cardiovas-
cular risk.22
This current cross-sectional study had
several strengths. For example, as far as we
ae aware, it is the first study to investigate
the possible association of hyperuricemia
with 10-year CHD risk based on FRS in a
large sample (n ¼ 6347) of middle-aged and
elderly Chinese patients. Also, a multivari-
able model was used to ensure that the
associations were independent of a consid-
erable number of potentially confounding
factors (i.e. BMI, creatinine, activity level,
alcohol consumption, educational back-
ground, occupation and diabetes status),
which improved the reliability of the results.
However, the study had some limitations.
First, the serum uric acid level was deter-
mined by a balance of uric acid generation,
reabsorption, and excretion. Thus, it could
have been influenced by various factors such
as the use of diuretics, dietary purine intake,
volume depletion and renal dysfunction.23
However, these factors were not recorded
and so they could not be assessed in this
study. Secondly, the cross-sectional design
of the study precluded analysis of causal
associations and therefore, further prospect-
ive studies and intervention trials should be
undertaken to establish any causal associ-
ation between hyperuricemia and CHD.
Finally, this study evaluated only middle-
aged and elderly patients undergoing a
health check-up, which limits the applicabil-
ity of these results to the general population.
In conclusion, this present study demon-
strated that hyperuricemia was positively
associated with 10-year risk of CHD.
Therefore, hyperuricemia may be an inde-
pendent CHD risk factor in middle-aged
and elderly Chinese patients. Additional
prospective studies are required to confirm
these findings.
