ABSTRACT
DMF (dimethyl fumarate) exerts anti-inflammatory and pro-
metabolic effects in a variety of cell types, and a formulation
(BG-12) is being evaluated for monotherapy in multiple
sclerosis patients. DMF modifies glutathione (GSH) levels that
can induce expression of the anti-inflammatory protein HO-1
(haem oxygenase-1). In primary astrocytes and C6 glioma
cells, BG-12 dose-dependently suppressed nitrite production
induced by either LI [LPS (lipopolysaccharide) at 1 mg/ml plus
IFNc (interferon c) at 20 units/ml] or a mixture of pro-
inflammatory cytokines, with greater efficacy in C6 cells.
BG-12 reduced NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2) mRNA levels
and activation of a NOS2 promoter, reduced nuclear levels of
NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) p65 subunit and attenuated loss
of IkBa (inhibitory kBa) in both cell types, although with
greater effects in astrocytes. In astrocytes, LI decreased mRNA
levels for GSHr (GSH reductase) and GCL (c-glutamylcysteine
synthetase), and slightly suppressed GSHs (GSH synthetase)
mRNAs. Co-treatment with BG-12 prevented those decreased
and increased levels above control values. In contrast, LI
reduced GSHp (GSH peroxidase) and GCL in C6 cells, and BG-
12 had no effect on those levels. BG-12 increased nuclear
levels of Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-related
factor 2), an inducer of GSH-related enzymes, in astrocytes
but not C6 cells. In astrocytes, GSH was decreased by BG-12 at
2 h and increased at 24 h. Prior depletion of GSH using
buthionine-sulfoximine increased the ability of BG-12 to
reduce nitrites. In astrocytes, BG-12 increased HO-1 mRNA
levels and effects on nitrite levels were blocked by an HO-1
inhibitor. These results demonstrate that BG-12 suppresses
inflammatory activation in astrocytes and C6 glioma cells, but
with distinct mechanisms, different dependence on GSH and
different effects on transcription factor activation.
Key words: nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2), inflammation,
glial cells, glutathione, multiple sclerosis.
INTRODUCTION
BG-12 is an FAE (fumaric acid ester), an oral formulation of DMF
(dimethyl fumarate) with known anti-inflammatory and neuro-
protective effects. FAEs were first considered for use as treatment
for psoriasis, a Th1-mediated disease, due to anti-proliferative
effects on lymphocytes (Stoof et al., 2001; Mrowietz and
Asadullah, 2005). One FAE (Fumaderm) has been approved for
psoriasis in Europe for over 15 years. Subsequent studies showed
that DMF reduces inflammatory gene expression, including that
of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and increases
anti-inflammatory expression (Stoof et al., 2001; Loewe et al.,
2002; Seidel et al., 2009) ­ effects likely to contribute to its anti-
psoriasis efficacy. These findings have led to increased interest for
using DMF in other auto-immune or inflammatory diseases,
including MS (multiple sclerosis) (Kappos et al., 2008;
Moharregh-Khiabani et al., 2009). In animal studies, BG-12
reduced glial inflammation during MOG-peptide-induced EAE
(experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) and increased
plasma levels of IL-10 (interleukin-10; Schilling et al., 2006). A
Phase 2B trial of BG-12 in RRMS (relapsing remitting MS)
patients showed significant decreases in new gadolinium
enhancing lesions, T1 and T2 lesions, and a non-significant
decrease in the annualized relapse rate (Kappos et al., 2008).

The mechanisms of the action of BG-12 are not fully known.
BG-12 can suppress NF-kB (nuclear factor kB)-dependent
transcription (Stoof et al., 2001; Gerdes et al., 2007), thus
accounting for some of its anti-inflammatory effects. BG-12 can
also activate the Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45 subunit-
related factor 2) pathway (Lukashev et al., 2007; Kappos et al.,
2008), which induces the transcription of various genes,
including anti-oxidative ones, reduces oxidative neuronal death
and helps maintain myelin integrity. BG-12 induces detoxifica-
tion enzymes in astrocytes and microglial cells (Wierinckx et al.,
2005). As a consequence, BG-12 can modulate GSH levels in cells
leading to cytotoxic or protective effects (Dethlefsen et al.,
1988; Spencer et al., 1990), including in primary astrocytes
(Schmidt and Dringen, 2010). The anti-inflammatory effects of
DMF have been shown, in some cases, to involve induction of
HO-1 (haem oxygenase 1) also termed HSP32 (heat-shock
protein 32) (Lehmann et al., 2007), which occurs following GSH
depletion. HO-1 can suppress a variety of inflammatory
responses (Horikawa et al., 2002), including those in astrocytes
(Calabrese et al., 2005; Guo and Bhat, 2006), as well as confer
protection against oxidative stress (Min et al., 2006).
A role for astrocyte activation during the pathogenesis of
MS and EAE has been implicated in several studies (Smith and
Lassmann, 2002). Inflammatory activation of astrocytes can
lead to the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well
as of the inducible form of NOS2 (nitric oxide synthase 2)
whose overproduction of NO contributes to oligodendrocyte
and neuronal damage. In vitro, astrocytes express NOS2 in
response to a variety of stimuli, and in MS the predominant
glial localization of NOS2 has been reported to be in astrocytes
(Brosnan et al., 1994; Broholm et al., 2004). An astrocytic
localization of NOS2 has also been reported in EAE (Brenner
et al., 1997; Tran et al., 1997) as well as in Theiler's virus model
of MS (Oleszak et al., 1997). The effects of BG-12 in astrocytes
have not been well characterized. A recent study shows anti-
inflammatory actions in microglial cells, but weaker effects in
primary astrocytes (Wilms et al., 2010). In the present study, we
have re-examined the ability of BG-12 to reduce NOS2
expression in primary astrocytes and compared those findings
with results using rat C6 glioma cells, often used to model
astrocyte biology (Feinstein et al., 1994). A comparison of the
anti-inflammatory actions of BG-12 in astrocytes versus C6
cells, combined with measurements of effects on intracellular
GSH levels, has allowed us to establish a linkage between these
two phenomena, and suggests that changes in GSH modulate
the suppressive efficacy of BG-12.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
Cell culture reagents [DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's
medium) and antibiotics] were from Cellgro Mediatech
(Manassas, VA, U.S.A.). FCS (fetal calf serum) (,10 units
endotoxin/ml) was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.).
Bacterial endotoxin LPS (Salmonella Typhimurium), BSO
(buthionine-sulfoximine), ZnPP (zinc protoporphyrin IX),
gentamicin (G418), antibiotics, and other common reagents
were from Sigma­Aldrich (St Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Recombinant
rat IFNc (interferon c), human IL-1b, and humanTNFa
(tumour necrosis factor a) were from Gibco (Gaithersburg,
MD, U.S.A.). BG-12 was provided by Biogen Idec (Cambridge,
MA, U.S.A.). Antibodies against NF-kB p65 subunit and IkBa
(inhibitory kBa) were from Santa Cruz Laboratories (Santa
Cruz, CA, U.S.A.), and those against b-actin were from Sigma.
Cells and treatments
Primary enriched astrocyte cultures were obtained from
cerebral cortices of postnatal day 1­2 Harlan Sprague­
Dawley rats as described previously (Galea et al., 1992). All
experiments using animals were carried out according to
institutional guidelines and were approved by the local
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Media were
changed every 3 days. After 2 weeks of growth in DMEM
containing 10% FCS and antibiotics (100 i.u./ml penicillin and
100 mg/ml streptomycin) the cultures consisted of 95­98%
astrocytes and 2­3% microglia. C6 rat glioma cells were
grown in DMEM containing 10% FCS and antibiotics. C6 cells
stably transfected with a 2.2 kb fragment of the rat NOS2
promoter (Gavrilyuk et al., 2001) driving expression of
luciferase were passaged in complete medium containing
200 mg/ml G418. Cell cultures when 80­90% confluent were
transferred to DMEM with 1% FCS and antibiotics and
treated with LI (LPS at 1 mg/ml plus IFNc at 20 units/ml) or TII
(10 ng/ml IL-1b, 10 ng/ml TNFa and 5 ng/ml IFNc) for robust
induction of NOS2. NOS2 activity was assessed indirectly by
nitrite production in the cell culture media (Green et al.
1982). Briefly, an aliquot of cell culture media (80 ml) was
mixed with 40 ml of Griess reagent and the absorbance was
measured at 550 nm. Cell viability was assessed by the release
of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) into the culture media using
the Cell-tox 96 kit (Promega, Madison, WI, U.S.A.).
mRNA analysis
Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared from cells using TRIzolH
reagent (Invitrogen); aliquots were converted into cDNA using
random hexamer primers. Quantitative changes in mRNA levels
were estimated by real-time PCR [qPCR (quantitative PCR)] using
the following cycling conditions: 35 cycles of denaturation at
95°C for 10 s, annealing at 58­61°C for 15 s depending on the
specific set of primers and extension at 72°C for 20 s. Reactions
were carried out in the presence of SYBR Green (1:10000 dilution
of stock solution from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, U.S.A.),
carried out in a 20-ml reaction volume in a Corbett Rotor-Gene
apparatus (Corbett Research, Mortlake, NSW, Australia). The
primers used for NOS2 were forward 59-GGAGAAGGGGACG-
AACTCAGT-39, and reverse: 59-GCATTGGAAGTGAAGCGTTTC-39;

TACGCTTGGTCT-39. Relative mRNA levels were estimated by the
comparative analysis of Ct values, and normalized to values
measured for b-tubulin in the same samples.
Luciferase activity assay measurements
Cells were lysed by Chaps buffer (10 mM Chaps and 10 mM Tris,
pH 7.4), the plate frozen at 280°C, thawed and shaken on a
rotary shaker for 10­15 min at room temperature (22°C).
Aliquots of cell lysates (10­20 ml) containing approximately
equal amounts of protein (10­20 mg) were placed into wells of
an opaque, white 96-well microplate. An equal volume of
luciferase substrate (Steady Glo reagent, Promega) was added
to all samples, and the luminescence measured in a microplate
luminometer (Rosys-Anthos, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland).
Glutathione assay
Total GSH levels (GSH+GSSG) were measured in whole cell
lysates using a commercial glutathione assay kit (Sigma
CS0260). In brief, following treatments, cells were collected,
pelleted, lysed, deproteinized, and aliquots of the resulting
supernatant mixed with 5,59-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)
and the formation of coloured 59-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid mea-
sured at 412 nm over 20 min.
Immunoblot analysis
After treatments, cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (1 mM EDTA,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate
and 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors.
Protein content was determined by Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, U.S.A.) with BSA as standard. A 10 mg aliquot of
protein was mixed with Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad), boiled for 5
min and separated through 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels.
Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes by
semi-dry electrophoretic transfer. The membranes were blocked
with 10% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in TBST (10
mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.6) for 1 h at
room temperature, then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-
IkBa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.) or
mouse monoclonal anti-b-actin antibody (Sigma) both at
1:1000 dilutions overnight with gentle shaking at 4°C. Primary
antibodies were removed, membranes washed three times in
TBST, then incubated 1 h at room temperature with specific
secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA,
U.S.A.). Following three washes in TBST, bands were visualized
by incubation in ECLH (enhanced chemiluminescence) reagents
and exposure to Hyperfilm ECL (GE Healthcare, New York, NY,
U.S.A.). The same membranes were washed three times in TBST,
blocked with 10% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk powder in
TBST for 1 h at room temperature and used for b-actin
immunoblot. Band intensities were determined using ImageJ
software (National Institutes of Health) from autoradiographs
obtained from the minimum exposure time that allowed band
detection, and background intensities (determined from an
equal-sized area of the film immediately above the band of
interest) were subtracted.
Immunocytochemical staining
Astrocytes and C6 cells were plated directly on to poly-lysine-
coated glass coverslips and grown until near confluency. The
cells were then treated with LI and 20 mM BG-12 or vehicle for
the indicated lengths of time. After treatment, medium was
removed, and cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at
room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with
PBS, blocked in 5% normal donkey serum in PBS containing
0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min; primary antibody was added
(goat anti-NF-kB p65 subunit, 1:100 dilution) and the mixture
incubated overnight at 4°C. The primary antibody was removed,
cells washed three times with PBS, then appropriate fluor-
escent-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-goat
1:200; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA, U.S.A.) were added; they were incubated for 45 min at 37°C,
washed, and then Vectashield mounting solution was added
(Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, U.S.A.). The coverslips
were mounted on to glass slides and imaged.
Transcription factor DNA-binding activity assay
Nuclear levels of active DNA-binding NF-kB p65 subunit and
Nrf2 were measured using ELISA-based TransAM kits (Active
Motif, Carslbad, CA, U.S.A.). In brief, the cells were incubated
with LI and 20 mM BG-12 or vehicle, and, at indicated times,
nuclear extracts were prepared, aliquots (2­10 mg) added to
wells containing consensus NF-kB or Nrf2-binding-site element
oligonucleotides, incubated 2 h at room temperature, washed
and then HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated antibodies
against p65 or Nrf2 added for 1 h, washed, substrate added and
colour intensity (for Nrf2) or chemiluminescence signal (for
p65) measured. Binding activity values were normalized for the
amount of protein per sample, and presented relative to activity
measured in non-treated (zero time) cells.
Data analysis
All experiments were performed at least in triplicate, and
repeated at least twice. Comparisons were made using one-
way ANOVA for dose­response curves, followed by Bonferroni

by unpaired t-test for group comparisons. Two-tailed
analyses were used, and statistical significance was taken at
P,0.05.
RESULTS
BG-12 reduces NOS2 activity and expression in
astrocytes and C6 cells
We first tested the effects of BG-12 on the expression and
activity of NOS2 in glial cells. In both primary astrocytes
and rat C6 glioma cells (Figure 1), BG-12 dose-dependently
reduced the LPS and IFNc (LI)-dependent production of
nitrites. In astrocytes, a slight (,20%) but significant
inhibition was observed at 3 mM, with maximal inhibition
of near 50% at 20 mM the highest dose tested. In contrast, in
C6 cells, 3 mM BG-12 reduced nitrite production approx. 50%,
with over 90% inhibition observed at a dose of 20 mM. In all
cases, incubation for 24 h with up to 20 mM BG-12 did not
increase LDH release from either astrocytes or C6 cells. BG-12
was also more effective at blocking nitrite production in C6
cells than in astrocytes when activation was carried out with
a combination of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure 2).
In both astrocytes and C6 cells, BG-12 significantly reduced
NOS2 mRNA levels (Figures 3A and 3B), suggesting an effect at
transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels. Consistent with
this, treatment with BG-12 potently suppressed the LI-
dependent activation of a 2.2 kb NOS2 promoter stably
expressed in C6 cells (Figure 3C), with significant inhibition
observed at 3 mM, and complete suppression at 20 mM,
suggesting a reduction in NOS2 gene transcription.

group and show % nitrite release as compared with LPS/IFNc alone (none),
which was 8.1 nmol of nitrite per mg per 24 h. The experiment was repeated
twice with similar results. *P,0.001 versus vehicle, one-way ANOVA,

assay. Results are means¡S.D. of n54 per group and show % nitrite release as compared with TII alone (0 BG-12), which was 16
nmol (for astrocytes) and 46 nmol (for C6 cells) nitrite per mg per 24 h. The experiment was repeated twice with similar results.

BG-12 reduces NF-kB activation in glial cells
Since NOS2 gene transcription is dependent on activation of
the transcription factor NF-kB, we tested the effects of BG-12
on activation of this factor using an EMSA (electrophoretic
mobility-shift assay)-based kit (Figure 4A). In astrocytes, LI
induced the appearance of nuclear p65 DNA-binding activity
by 30 min, which returned to baseline by 4 h; in C6 cells
nuclear activity was still high at 2 h, the longest time point
measured. At all time points nuclear p65 activity was
significantly reduced by BG-12. Immunostaining (Figure 4B)
showed that, after 1 h incubation with LI, BG-12 almost
completely reduced nuclear levels of the NF-kB p65 subunit in
astrocytes. In contrast, in C6 cells nuclear p65 could still be
detected in many cells, suggesting that the nuclear p65 was
unable to bind DNA. Western-blot analysis of whole cell lysates
showed that, in astrocytes, BG-12 significantly reduced the
rapid LI-dependent loss of IkBa (Figures 5A and 5C). In
contrast, in C6 cells the loss of IkBa measured after 30 min was
only slightly reduced by BG-12, while after 60 min levels were
lower in the BG-12 treated cells. Together, these results
suggest that the effects of BG-12 on NOS2 are due, at least in
part, to the inhibition of NOS2 gene expression, and that
suppression of IkBa degradation and NF-kB activation
contributes to that reduction, although differences exist
between its actions in astrocytes and C6 cells.
BG-12 differentially modulates GSH levels in
astrocytes versus C6 cells
DMF can increase GSH levels which in turn can influence
inflammatory responses; we therefore tested if
Figure 3 BG-12 reduces NOS2 expression
(A) Primary astrocytes and (B) C6 cells were treated with LPS/IFNc for 6 h alone, or in the presence of 10 mM BG-12 or equivalent
amount of DMSO (Veh), then RNA samples were measured by qPCR for NOS2 mRNA levels. Results show the relative NOS2 mRNA
level after normalization to b-tubulin mRNA values measured in the same samples. Results are means¡S.D. for three samples from
each group. LPS/IFNc increased NOS2 mRNA levels approx. 2600-fold in astrocytes, and 1800-fold in C6 cells over baseline levels.
*P,0.05 versus vehicle. (C) C6 cells stably transfected with rat 2.2 kb NOS2 promoter driving luciferase activity were treated with
LPS/IFNc in the presence of the indicated concentrations of BG-12 or vehicle (20 mM DMSO). After 5 h, luciferase activity was
measured. Results are means¡S.D. for three to six samples per group and show promoter activation relative to no BG-12. Treatment
with LPS/IFNc increased the NOS2 promoter 65-fold over control levels. Experiments were repeated twice with similar results.
*P,0.05 versus vehicle, one-way ANOVA, Bonferroni post hoc.
Figure 4 BG-12 reduces NF-kB activation
(A) Astrocytes and C6 cells were treated with LPS/IFNc in the presence of 20
mM BG-12 (open circles) or vehicle (filled circles) and after the indicated
times nuclear lysates prepared and levels of active nuclear p65 binding to
DNA measured with the TransAM (p65) assay kit. The amount of active p65
was normalized to levels measured in the non-treated (zero time) samples.
Results are means¡S.E., n53 or 4 per group. BG-12 significantly reduced
p65-binding activity in both cells types (F[3,1]5 6.7 in astrocytes, 7.1 in C6
cells; P,0.005, two-way ANOVA; *P,0.05; ***P,0.001, Bonferroni post hoc).
(B) Astrocytes and C6 cells grown on glass coverslips were treated as
described above then fixed and stained for the presence of NF-kB p65. After
1 h incubation, nuclear staining for p65 was observed in most of the vehicle-
treated cells, was absent from the BG-12-treated astrocytes and was still
present in many of the BG-12-treated C6 cells (arrowheads).

BG-12 modified glial cell mRNA levels of enzymes involved in
GSH metabolism (Figure 6). Quantitative PCR showed that,
in astrocytes, after 6 h incubation, levels of GSHr and GCL
mRNAs were significantly reduced by LI, while the levels of
GSHs were reduced but that decrease did not reach statistical
significance. Treatment with BG-12, but not vehicle,
prevented the decrease of both GCL and GSHr mRNAs, and
significantly increased levels of GSHs compared with
incubation with LI alone. The effect of BG-12 on the GSHr
was significantly different compared with vehicle, and almost
(P50.063) significant for GSHr. In contrast with astrocytes,
while treatment of C6 cells with LI significantly reduced levels
of GSHp and GCL, BG-12 did not modify expression of any of
the mRNAs tested compared with LI alone or to vehicle.
Since expression of some GSH related mRNAs can be
induced by transcription factor Nrf2, we tested effects of BG-
12 on the activation of this factor (Figure 7). In astrocytes,
but not in C6 cells, BG-12 significantly increased nuclear Nrf2
DNA-binding activity compared with vehicle-treated cells
(Figure 7A), with significant pairwise differences present at 1
and 4 h, the longest time tested.
Consistent with increased GSHr and GCL mRNA levels,
measurements of total intracellular GSH (GSH plus GSSG)
content showed that BG-12 significantly increased GSH levels
in primary astrocytes (Figure 8A) but not C6 cells (Figure 8B).
In astrocytes, the increase was both time- and dose-
dependent, since, at the lower dose of 3 mM, an increase was
not observed at 2 h, but only after 24 h. In contrast, at the
higher dose of 20 mM, we observed a significant reduction in
GSH after 2 h incubation, but a significant increase after 24 h.
Reduction of GSH levels increases NOS2
suppression by BG-12
To determine if changes in GSH levels played a role in NOS2
suppression, we examined the effects of BG-12 on NOS2 ex-
pression in cells pretreated with BSO to deplete GSH levels
(Figure 9). In both astrocytes and C6 cells, pretreatment with
BSO had a small but non-significant effect on the ability of
3 mM BG-12 to reduce nitrite production. However, the
suppression by 10 mM BG-12 was significantly increased by
BSO in both C6 cells and primary astrocytes. At 20 mM BG-12,
the highest dose tested, there was potent inhibition (close to
90%) of C6 cell nitrites that was not significantly increased by
BSO; in contrast, the suppression observed in the astrocytes
(approx. 70% inhibition compared with DMSO control) was
significantly increased by BSO to near the levels achieved in C6
cells. These results suggest that GSH normally restricts the
ability of BG-12 to reduce NOS2 expression in glial cells.
BG-12 effects in astrocytes involve induction of
HO-1
The anti-inflammatory effects of GSH depletion have been
shown to involve induction of HO-1 [also called HSP32

(heat-shock protein 32)] in some cells. In primary astrocytes,
mRNA levels of HO-1 were low, and slightly decreased
(,50%) by incubation with LI, whereas co-incubation with
10 mM BG-12 increased steady state mRNA levels over
15-fold (Figure 10A). HO-1 mRNA levels were approximately
three times higher in untreated C6 cells compared with
untreated astrocytes; however, those levels were not altered
either by incubation with LI or by BG-12 (Figure 10B).
Consistent with this, co-incubation with ZnPP, a selective
inhibitor of HO-1, significantly attenuated the suppressive
effects of BG-12 in astrocytes, but not in C6 cells (Figure 11).
These results suggest that, despite having similar effects on
GSH levels, the anti-inflammatory actions of BG-12 are
mediated by different mechanisms in primary astrocytes
compared with transformed C6 cells.
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we examined the effects of BG-12,
currently being tested in clinical trials for treatment of MS,
on a robust inflammatory activation of glial cells. During
disease progression in MS, activation of parenchymal glial
cells, both microglia as well as astroglia, results in sustained
production of pro-inflammatory substances which contribute
to neuronal and oligodendrocyte damage. Although BG-12
was introduced as a potential therapy for MS by virtue of its
ability to reduce activation of lymphocytes (Gerdes et al.,
2007; Lehmann et al., 2007; Milenkovic et al., 2008), its
possible effects on brain glial cell activation have not been
well characterized. Our results confirm and expand on a
recent study that 10 mM DMF reduced cytokine (IL-1b, IL-6
and TNFa) mRNA levels in primary rat astrocytes, although
levels of NOS2 mRNA were not significantly reduced (Wilms
et al., 2010). Interestingly, those authors found that DMF
more potently (e.g. greater reductions) suppressed microglial
compared with astroglial cytokine expression. Although GSH
levels were not measured in that study, our present findings
suggest that the effects of DMF on GSH in microglia may be
similar to what is observed in C6 cells.

Our results demonstrate that the induction of NOS2 in
primary astrocytes is suppressed by BG-12. Nitrite accumula-
tion after 24 h was modestly reduced by lower doses (3 and
10 mM) of BG-12, and significantly reduced in the presence of
20 mM drug. BG-12 more potently suppressed NOS2 activity
in C6 cells, since incubation with 3 mM BG-12 reduced nitrite
production approx. 50%, and 20 mM BG-12 almost
completely abolished nitrite. Despite these differences, BG-
12 had a similar effect on steady-state NOS2 mRNA levels in
both cell types when measured after 5 h. This suggests that
in both these cells, BG-12 is effective at reducing NOS2
transcription at early times, but that compensatory changes
may occur at later times in astrocytes, but not C6 cells that
allow for further or increased NOS2 expression or activity.
We observed that BG-12 potently prevented activation of
the NOS2 promoter, suggesting an effect occurring at the
level of NOS2 gene transcription. Since optimal NOS2
expression depends upon NF-kB activation, we examined
the effects of BG-12 on this transcription factor. In both
astrocytes and C6 cells, BG-12 potently reduced the nuclear
levels of NF-kB p65 able to bind to DNA, determined using an
EMSA-based kit. In astrocytes, immunostaining showed a
large reduction in the presence of nuclear p65, while
immunoblot analysis showed that BG-12 prevented the loss
of the IkBa inhibitory subunit. Together these findings are
consistent with the idea that, in astrocytes, BG-12 inhibits
IkBa degradation, reduces NF-kB nuclear transport, and
thereby reduces NOS2 gene expression. On the other hand, in
C6 cells similar immunostaining revealed nuclear p65 in some
cells and only modest effects on the loss of IkBa, despite the
fact that EMSAs did not detect any NF-kB p65 DNA-binding
activity at that time point. These findings suggest that
whereas BG-12 does not prevent IkBa loss or NF-kB p65
nuclear translocation, the nuclear p65 is less able to bind to
cognate DNA. DMF can covalently modify proteins owing to
the presence of an a/b unsaturated carbonyl group (Frycak et
Figure 8 Effects of BG-12 on GSH levels
(A) Primary astrocytes were treated with LPS/IFNc together with BG-12 or vehicle at the indicated doses and for either 2 or 24 h, after
which intracellular total GSH levels were measured. (B) C6 cells were incubated with LPS/IFNc in the presence of the indicated
concentration of BG-12 or vehicle. After 24 h, levels of free GSH were measured in whole cell lysates. Results show the GSH level
relative to control value measured after 2 h in 3 mM vehicle, and are means¡S.D. for three samples per group. *P,0.05 versus vehicle.
Figure 9 GSH depletion increases inhibition by BG-12
Primary astrocytes and C6 cells were pretreated with 500 mM BSO overnight
to deplete GSH levels. The next day the cells were treated with LPS/IFNc
together with the indicated doses of BG-12 or vehicle, and nitrite levels were
measured 24 h later. Results are means¡S.D. for three samples per group,
and shows the % nitrite production measured in the presence of BG-12

were determined by qPCR. Resuls are means¡S.D. of three samples per group

al., 2005; Schmidt et al., 2007), and it has been suggested
that this modification reduces the ability of p65 to bind to
DNA (Seidel et al., 2009). In C6 cells, the low levels of NF-kB
p65 activity could therefore be due to modification of this
subunit by BG-12. BG-12 could also have important effects
on nuclear levels or DNA-binding activity of other NF-kB
subunits such as c-Rel, p50 or p52, which are differentially
regulated by DMF in other cell types (Vandermeeren et al.,
2001; Loewe et al., 2002; Meili-Butz et al., 2008) and whose
relative levels could influence overall NOS2 gene expression.
Measurements of mRNA levels for enzymes involved in
GSH synthesis show that BG-12 induced several of these
(GSHs, GSHr and GCL) in astrocytes, but was without effect in
C6 cells. BG-12 also increased GSH levels in astrocytes, but
not in C6 cells, when measured after 24 h. These results point
to differences in the ability of BG-12 to induce an anti-
oxidant response in these cells, and measurement of nuclear
levels of transcription factor Nrf2, a potent inducer of anti-
oxidant genes, confirmed that BG-12 only activated this
factor in astrocytes. Nrf2 is kept in the cytoplasm by
association with the Keap1 protein, which normally promotes
Nrf2 ubiquitination and degradation. In response to various
stresses (Giudice et al., 2010), Keap1 thiol groups are modified
which prevents Nrf2 degradation, and allows Nrf2 to
translocate into the nucleus where it can activate transcrip-
tion of several anti-oxidant genes, including that encoding
GCL. It was reported that DMF treatment led to the activation
of Nrf2 in the CNS (central nervous system; Lukashev et al.,
2007; Kappos et al., 2008), which likely contributes to the
beneficial effects of BG-12 seen in MS. Our findings suggest
that the induction of Nrf2 in astrocytes increases their
production of GSH which can have cytoprotective effects for
glial cells as well as for neighbouring neurons. The reason for
lack of effect of BG-12 on Nrf2 activation in C6 cells is not
clear. It was suggested that, similar to modification of NF-kB
p65, a direct reaction between DMF and Keap1 thiol groups
could occur, leading to Nrf2 stabilization (Lukashev et al.,
2007). If so, than interactions of BG-12 with other targets in
C6 cells could limit its ability to interact with Keap1.
Our findings indicate that BG-12 more potently inhibits
NOS2 in C6 cells than in astrocytes, the cells in which GSH
levels are also increased. Several studies have reported that
GSH forms a stable complex with DMF thus reducing both their
concentrations (Nelson et al., 1999; Schmidt et al., 2007); if so,
then higher GSH levels might be expected to reduce the ability
of BG-12 to suppress NOS2 expression. To test this possibility,
we made use of BSO to selectively deplete GSH levels. We used
a dose (500 mM) reported to lead to over 80% depletion at 24 h
(Schmidt et al., 2007). Under these conditions, we found that
BG-12 more potently reduced nitrite production in both cell
types, and that 20 mM now reduced astrocyte nitrite pro-
duction to an extent comparable with that in C6 cells.
In the present study a comparison of the effects of BG-12
in astrocytes to its effects in C6 glioma cells has identified
interactions between the anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant
effects of this drug. While NF-kB activation was significantly
reduced in both cell types, the basis for that inactivation was
different, since p65 nuclear levels were strongly attenuated in
astrocytes, but less so in C6 cells. Findings that BG-12
activated Nrf2 in astrocytes, but not in C6 cells, help explain
results that GSH enzymes are induced and GSH levels only
increased in astrocytes. Although the basis for differences
between astrocytes and C6 cells is not clear, the increased
metabolic demands of transformed cells likely plays a role.
Finally, since increased GSH levels can reduce the effective
concentrations of BG-12 able to react with its protein targets
(e.g. p65 and Keap1), our findings suggest a complex
relationship in which compensatory responses to BG-12,
designed to maintain an anti-oxidative state, may limit its
anti-inflammatory properties.
