Introduction
A systematic review of surveys on complementary and alter-
native medicine (CAM) use among cancer patients in North
America, Europe, and Australia/New Zealand found that the
United States has the highest CAM use among cancer
patients, and its CAM use has been increasing over the past
3 decades.1 The CAM prevalence among cancer patients
was estimated at around 60% to 80%, but it depends on fac-
tors such as cancer type, sampling methods, time recalls, and
decade of study.1-6
Cancer care providers' knowledge of their patients'
CAM use is becoming important because of potential inter-
actions with routine cancer treatments.7,8 Cancer survivors
are more likely to use CAM because of recommendations
from their providers and are more likely to disclose their
CAM use to their provider than noncancer controls,9
although the nondisclosure rate still remains high, estimated
at around 80% (77% to 84%).9,10
The majority of studies on CAM use among cancer patients
do not specify the time periods in relation to cancer diagnoses,
or the time periods of CAM use are highly varied among
included individuals.1 Having information on CAM use over
different time periods in relation to cancer diagnosis will
allow investigation of change in patient behavior, thus facili-
tating patient-provider discussion of the risks of benefit and
harm of CAM use over these time periods and referring

Complementary and Alternative Medicine
Use at a Comprehensive Cancer Center
Qianlai Luo, PhD, MSc1, and Gary N. Asher, MD, MPH1
Abstract
Background. Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use is common among cancer patients, but the majority of
CAM studies do not specify the time periods in relation to cancer diagnoses. We sought to define CAM use by cancer
patients and investigate factors that might influence changes in CAM use in relation to cancer diagnoses. Methods. We
conducted a cross-sectional survey of adults diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer between 2010 and
2012 at the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center. Questionnaires were sent to 1794 patients. Phone calls were made to
nonrespondents. Log binomial/Poisson regressions were used to investigate the association between cancer-related changes
in CAM use and conversations about CAM use with oncology providers. Results. We received 603 (33.6 %) completed
questionnaires. The mean age (SD) was 64 (11) years; 62% were female; 79% were white; and 98% were non-Hispanic.
Respondents reported the following cancer types: breast (47%), prostate (27%), colorectal (14%), lung (11%). Eighty-nine
percent reported lifetime CAM use. Eighty-five percent reported CAM use during or after initial cancer treatment, with
category-specific use as follows: mind-body medicine 39%, dietary supplements 73%, body-based therapies 30%, and energy
medicine 49%. During treatment CAM use decreased for all categories except energy medicine. After treatment CAM
use returned to pretreatment levels for most CAMs except chiropractic. Initiation of CAM use after cancer diagnosis
was positively associated with a patient having a conversation about CAM use with their oncology provider, mainly
driven by patient-initiated conversations. Conclusions. Consistent with previous studies, CAM use was common among our
study population. Conversations about CAM use with oncology providers appeared to influence cessation of mind-body
medicine use after cancer diagnosis.

patients to providers who are trained to discuss CAM. When
this information is combined with information on patient-pro-
vider communication, it can provide insight into the role of
patient-provider communication in cancer patients'CAM use.
Using a questionnaire-based survey, we aimed to yield
point estimates of CAM use among adult cancer patients
treated in the past 2 years with the 4 most common cancers:
breast, lung, prostate, or colorectal. Specifically, we assessed
CAM in the following 3 time periods: before, during, and
after initial cancer treatment in order to identify cancer-related
changes in CAM use. We also investigated the communica-
tion patterns between patients and oncology providers and
how that was associated with cancer-related CAM change.
Methods
Study Population
We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adult cancer
patients seeking care at the North Carolina Cancer Hospital
(NCCH) between 2010 and 2012. Eligible participants
were English-speaking, between 21 and 99 years of age,
and diagnosed with breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal
cancer between 2010 and 2012. Participants were identi-
fied from the University of North Carolina (UNC) Tumor
Registry, which is a comprehensive database of patients
diagnosed with cancer at the NCCH, the clinical home of
the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC).
Potential participants were mailed an introductory letter,
questionnaire, and a return-postage envelope. Follow-up
telephone call and a second questionnaire were sent to non-
respondents. We made up to 3 attempts to contact patients
by telephone. The Institutional Review Board at UNC
approved the research protocol, and all study participants
gave informed consent.
Data Collection
We adapted a questionnaire used by Richardson etal11 to
assess CAM use at a comprehensive cancer center. We asked
about CAM use in 4 primary categories: mind-body medi-
cine, dietary supplements, body-based therapies, and energy
medicine. We also queried use of whole medical systems
such as traditional Chinese medicine and ayurveda.
Respondents were asked to indicate whether they had ever
used specific CAM therapies in each of these categories, and
if so, when that use occurred in relation to their initial cancer
treatment (ie, before, during, or after). Information on sources
of advice on CAM use and discussion of CAM use with
oncology providers was also gathered. The questionnaire was
pilot-tested on volunteers for readability and face validity.
The tumor registry provided demographic and clinical data
such as diagnosis date, tumor type and stage, and treatment
history.
Statistical Analysis
We provide descriptive data for age, sex, as well as cancer
type and stage, in addition to prevalence of CAM use (fre-
quency, percentage). Patients with stage 0 and stage 1 can-
cers were combined into an "early-stage cancer" group
because of their prognostic and treatment similarities when
compared with later-stage cancers.
We used log-binomial and Poisson regression to investi-
gate how communication of CAM was associated with
changes in CAM use after cancer diagnosis. For all regres-
sions, we started with the full model that included variables
such as age, education level, cancer type and cancer stage,
and ran backward elimination to come up with the most
succinct model (likelihood ratio test cutoff P = .05). All
breast cancer cases were female, all prostate cancer cases
were male, so following previous studies, we did not adjust
for sex in these regressions.4 The analyses were performed
using Stata IC Version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
We sent out 1794 questionnaires and received 603 (33.6%)
completed questionnaires. The mean age of respondents
was 63.5 (±11.0) years. Sixty-two percent of respondents
were female, 79% were white, and 98% were non-Hispanic.
Compared with nonrespondents, respondents were more
likely to be white (79.3% vs 68.4%), female (61.7% vs
55.3%), have breast cancer (46.9% vs 39.4%), and have
early-stage cancer (46.4% vs 39.5%; Table 1).
Eighty-nine percent of respondents reported ever using a
CAM therapy during their lifetime. CAM use appeared to
decrease during active cancer treatment compared with use
prior to treatment for all CAM categories except energy
medicine, which was largely driven by prayer and spiritual
healing practices (Figure 1). CAM use was common both
during and after cancer treatment for all CAM therapy cat-
egories. The most common therapies used included: vita-
min and mineral supplements (56% and 66%, during and
after treatment, respectively); prayer and spiritual healing
(46% and 43%); herbal supplements (25% and 32%), mas-
sage and movement therapy (16% and 24%); and deep
breathing exercises (16% and 19%). Use of CAM therapies
after treatment returned to pretreatment levels for most
CAMs with the exception of chiropractic, which dropped
during active treatment and remained low after treatment
(20% vs 5% vs 9%).
In the periods after cancer diagnosis (ie, during and after
cancer treatment), 85% of respondents reported using at
least one CAM therapy. CAM use was most common
among breast cancer patients (93%), followed by colorectal
cancer (83%), prostate cancer (77%), and lung cancer (77%;
Table 2). For patients of each of the 4 cancer types, dietary
supplements were the most commonly used CAM modality
106 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(1)
(52% to 82%), followed by energy medicine (39% to 55%),
mind-body medicine (16% to 52%), and body-based ther-
apy (14% to 42%).
Most patients who used CAM therapy during or after
cancer treatment were likely to use more than 1 CAM ther-
apy simultaneously (58%; Table 3). Twenty-eight percent of
respondents reported using only 1 CAM therapy, which was
most often a dietary supplement (71%).
Twenty-three percent (136/603) of all respondents
reported having a conversation about CAM with their
oncology provider. Initiation of CAM use any time after
cancer diagnosis was positively associated with a patient
having a conversation about CAM use with their oncology
provider (Table 4). Further analysis revealed the increased
likelihood of new CAM use was more driven by patient-
provider interactions in which patients initiated conversa-
tion about CAM, rather than CAM conversations initiated
by cancer care provider (data not shown). Cessation of
CAM therapy use during or after initial cancer treatment, on
the other hand, was negatively associated with patient-pro-
vider conversation for MBM (prevalence ratio = 0.46, 95%
CI = 0.22-0.93; Table 5). In other words, patients who had
conversations with providers were less likely to cease MBM
therapies during or after initial cancer treatment. We found
no association between cancer type and either initiation or
cessation of CAM use. We found no association between
more advanced cancer stage and number of CAM therapies.
We found no association between the type of treatment and
CAM use or change (initiation and cessation) in CAM use
since diagnosis.
Discussion
We set out to describe CAM use among cancer patients, as
well as the communication pattern between patients and
provider and its association with patients' CAM use. We
collected data on CAM use before, during, and after initial
cancer treatment using a cancer patient sample at University
of North Carolina Cancer Hospital, which allowed us to
investigate changes in CAM use over time. We had data for
discrete time periods related to time of diagnosis, which
helped us understand CAM use before, during, and after
treatment.
We found high lifetime CAM use (89%) in our popula-
tion. The response rate is slightly higher among breast can-
cer patients, a subgroup that is known to use CAM therapies
more than patients of other cancer types. Nevertheless, this
prevalence is similar compared to previous studies in can-
cer populations.11 Richardson etal11 found 83% of the can-
cer patients used at least 1 CAM therapy. Yates etal12 found
CAM use as high as 91% among cancer patients during che-
motherapy and radiation. However, differences in the defi-
nition of CAM modalities for each study may confound
comparison of these prevalence estimates. For example,
Yates etal12 found that "prayer," "relaxation," and "exer-
cise" were the most commonly used CAM therapies. But,
our question about prayer defined the activity as "prayer for
healing" rather than a general question about any prayer.
Not surprisingly, our estimates for prayer were lower than
those reported by Yates etal12 (45% vs 77%, respectively).
Similarly, we asked about specific exercises such as T'ai
chi, Qiqong, and yoga, rather than a general question about
exercise. Accordingly, we found that during initial cancer
treatment, dietary supplements, not prayer or exercise, were
the most common CAM therapy used, followed by energy
medicine (in which prayer is the main driver), and then
mind-body medicine, and body-based therapies. Dietary
supplements have been reported to be the most common
CAM therapy in a few other studies, including one study
that used the 2007 National Health Interview Survey.4,13
We found that CAM use generally decreased during
active cancer treatment compared with use prior to diagno-
sis and returned to pretreatment levels after completion of
cancer treatment. Notable exceptions to this trend were sus-
tained levels of prayer, spiritual healing, deep breathing
exercise, and light/magnet therapy during cancer treatment.
The reason for the decrease of CAM use during cancer
treatment may be 2-fold. First, doctors and health providers
might have spoken to patients and advised against CAM
use, although in our study we did not collect data on whether
the doctor recommended for or against CAM use. Second,
when patients are diagnosed with cancer and start the sub-
sequent counseling and treatment, the process is complex
and cognitively taxing for the patients. Such large cognitive
load and high volume of complex decision making have

been linked to decision fatigue and thus decision simplifica-
tion strategies.14-16
Interestingly, posttreatment levels of chiropractic
remained low, suggesting patients may have been uncom-
fortable returning to that therapy based on their cancer
diagnosis.
For patients' CAM use by cancer types, we found the
highest CAM use among breast cancer patients, followed
by colorectal cancer patients, and then prostate and lung
cancer patients. A similar pattern across cancer types is also
seen in a few other studies. For example, Patterson etal,4
using a telephone survey of cancer patients identified from
the population-based Cancer Surveillance System of
Western Washington, found that CAM use was highest
among breast cancer patients (87%), followed by colorectal
(64%) and prostate (59%) cancer patients. Lafferty etal,17
using a registry-matched insurance claims database, also
noted a similar pattern: Compared with colorectal cancer
patients, breast cancer patients had higher CAM use during
initial treatment and continued use after treatment (odds
ratio [OR] = 1.85, 95% CI =1.19-2.87 and OR = 2.04, 95%
CI = 1.29-3.22, respectively), prostate cancer patients has
slightly higher or similar CAM use (OR = 1.13, 95% CI =
0.71-1.81 and OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 0.79-2.09, respectively)

Each graph depicts total proportion of participants that used at least one therapy for that category of CAM therapy (diamond lines).
Proportions for individual CAM therapies are represented in the lower lines. For example, during cancer treatment, about 59% of our
population reported taking a dietary supplement (Figure 1b). Almost all participants who reported taking a supplement took a vitamin
or mineral supplement (square line), and about 44% (0.26/0.59) reported taking an herbal or other type of supplement (triangle line).

during and after treatment, followed by lung cancer patients
(OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 0.72-2.38 and OR = 1.05, 95% CI =
0.53-2.07, respectively).
We found that initiation of CAM therapy across all four
CAM categories during and after cancer treatment was pos-
itively associated with having a conversation about CAM
with an oncology provider. Although we do not have infor-
mation on the content of those conversations, our data show
that patients who initiated a conversation with their medical
provider about CAM use were also more likely to initiate
new CAM use after diagnosis. Although it is possible that
some oncology providers may have been suggesting use of
some CAM therapies, it is more likely that patients who
were motivated to discuss CAM therapies with their provid-
ers were also strongly motivated to use them prior to their
discussions.
Our findings have implications for communications
between oncology providers and cancer patients. First,
patients who initiate a conversation about CAM are more
likely to initiate CAM use. In their communications about
CAM therapies with providers, patients often recognize that
medical providers are typically not CAM experts and they
are especially concerned about negative responses from
their providers.18 While most cancer patients use CAM in
order to boost the immune system, relieve pain, and control
side effects as a result of disease or treatment,19 they are
typically looking for the best of both worlds: CAM plus
conventional cancer treatment together.20 However, nondis-
closure of CAM use to cancer care providers remains com-
mon.18,21 Given the high prevalence of CAM use among
cancer patients, emerging evidence that certain CAM thera-
pies can improve patient quality of life and reduce treatment
and disease-related symptoms, and the potential interaction
between some CAM therapies and conventional cancer
treatment, we encourage oncology providers to discuss
CAM use with their patients in an open and nonjudgmental
fashion in order to facilitate patient-centered communica-
tion as well as participatory patient decision making.22
Second, if oncology providers wish to influence their
patient's decisions about CAM use, they may need to use
additional strategies and resources to help them. For exam-
ple, recommendations about specific dietary supplement-
drug interactions may be more persuasive for patients
compared to general recommendations to avoid supple-
ments altogether during treatment. Where oncologists do
not have such expertise, cancer centers could employ phar-
macy and CAM specialists who are trained to discuss sup-
plement-drug interactions.
Limitations
Our response rate was low, which may bias our prevalence
estimates for overall CAM use. However, the rate of CAM
use among respondents was very high, suggesting that our
sample may have included most of the CAM users among
our patient population. As such, the information we have on
communication among CAM users remains relevant, espe-
cially for the early stage cancers were the response rates
were highest.Additionally, we can estimate CAM use preva-
lence using sensitivity analysis. For example, assuming that

only 10% of nonrespondents used CAM therapies during or
after cancer diagnosis on the lower boundary and 30% were
CAM users on the upper boundary (514/1794 = 29%), then
we can estimate the prevalence of CAM use during or after
cancer treatment lies between 37% and 49%. Second, this is
a retrospective study, and we relied on participants for the
accuracy and completeness of their responses. Third, we did
not collect information on other possible factors which may
affect patients' CAM uptake and change in CAM use. Last,
we recognize that advanced-stage cancer patients were only
6.5% of our study population and as a result our study results
may not fully represent patients with advanced cancers.
