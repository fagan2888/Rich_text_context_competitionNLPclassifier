Recently, there has been considerable emphasis placed on
the role of environmental supports in defining the concept of
disability. The International Classification of Functioning,
Disability, and Health (ICF) defines disability as the com-
plex outcome between a person's health condition and envi-
ronmental factors, which include social, physical, and policy
supports (Schneidert, Hurst, Miller, & Üstün, 2003). This
emphasis on the role of environment corresponds to the
socio-ecological perspective of Bronfenbrenner (1979), who
views human development as the evolving interaction
between the person and environment (recited in Berry, 1995).
The socio-ecological perspective holds that successful out-
comes in human functioning may depend more on the match
between individuals and their environments than on individ-
ual personal characteristics alone (Thompson, Tasse, &
McLaughlin, 2008). As such, a disability is heavily influ-
enced not only by internal traits but also by the varied sup-
ports that enable an individual to function in the environment
(Claes, Van Hove, Vandevelde, Loon, & Schalock, 2012).
Environmental support in this context is defined as the over-
riding "resources and strategies that aim to promote the
development, education, interests, and personal wellbeing of
a person and that enhance individual functioning" (Luckasson
et al., 2002, p.145). Obtaining information about the indi-
vidual and the environment is a critical starting point which
enables the individual to benefit from socio-ecological per-
spective, because of the inability and limitation the individ-
ual has. The primary sources of these environmental supports
are parents, siblings, and service providers of the individuals.
Abery and Stancliffe (Stancliffe, 1997; Stancliffe & Abery,
1997; Stancliffe, Abery, & Smith, 2000) closely examined
the relationship between individual levels of self-determina-
tion and residential environment occurring at the micro-sys-
tem levels of the ecological perspective. The residential
environment examined in those studies included staff
arrangement, residence size, number of residents, and resi-
dence location. Another study by Wehmeyer and Bolding
(2001) examined the effects that transitioning from institu-
tionalization to community residences had on self-determi-
nation in adults with severe intellectual disabilities. The
results of this study were consistent with those of the previ-
ous study by Stancliffe and Abery (1997). They found sig-
nificant improvement in the areas of self-determination,
autonomy, and choice-making in adults with severe intellec-
tual disabilities after they moved from more restrictive resi-
dential institutions to less restrictive community residences.
Stancliffe, Abery, Springborg, and Elkin (2000) also exam-
ined the effect of substitute decision-making (e.g., a legal
guardianship or conservatorship) on the personal control of
adults with intellectual disabilities at the macro-system level.

A Preliminary Validation Study of
the Korean Version of the Minnesota
Self-Determination Scales for Adults
With Intellectual Disabilities
Jaehyun Cho1
Abstract
The Minnesota Self-Determination Scale (MSDS) was translated into Korean. The Korean version was then validated using a
sample of 40 individuals with intellectual disabilities between the ages of 19 and 45 years, the legal age of adults in South Korea.
The evidence of the reliability and validity was examined. The test­retest was good (.84-.94). The internal consistency was
excellent (.96-.99). The construct validity with other Korean translated self-determination measure (K-SDS) was acceptable
(.50-.51). The findings indicated that the K-MSDS was an appropriate measure with acceptable psychometric properties. The
Korean version was the first self-determination measure for adults with disabilities.

The results demonstrated that adults without any substitute
decision makers exercised significantly higher levels of per-
sonal control than those with a conservator or a guardian.
However, there was no assessment conducted to systemi-
cally identify which facilitators and barriers existed, and
examined how they influenced the individuals with disabili-
ties either at the micro- or at the macro-system levels in
South Korea (Cho, 2009).
Problems
Since 2000, significant efforts have been made in South
Korea toward the development of self-determination skills in
individuals with disabilities have. These efforts have included
development of interventional programs (Bang, 2000;
H. O. Park, 2006; Rhyou, 2003), and examination of out-
comes related to an individual's self-determination level after
participating in these programs (E. Kim & Kim, 2005, 2006;
S. W. Park & Kim, 2004). Shogren et al. (2008) asserted that
self-determination measures should be used to develop,
implement, and evaluate the effect of self-determination
interventions on individuals with disabilities. Unfortunately,
the development of norm-referenced and standardized mea-
sures of self-determination for individuals with disabilities
which report acceptable psychometric properties has been
very limited in South Korea. Since 2000, three self-determi-
nation measures have been translated into Korean (Cho,
2009). However, only one of these measures included discus-
sion of psychometric properties and contained a standardized
sample that matched the recent South Korea census in terms
of gender, age, family socio-economic status, and regional
representation (J. K. Kim, Cho, Moon, & Kim, 2001).
The second problem identified was the lack of self-deter-
mination measures developed for adults in South Korea.
Most measures privileged the evaluation of self-determina-
tion of secondary students with intellectual disabilities, and
focused less on the importance of promoting and measuring
self-determination in both young children and adults (Lee &
Wehmeyer, 2003). However, the ultimate goal of special
education in South Korea is to promote the full inclusion of
students with disabilities (Korean Department of Education
& Human Resources, 2003). Considering that self-determi-
nation is a developmental process intended to increase
autonomy over the course of one's life span (Abery &
Stancliffe, 2003; Wehmeyer, 1998), it was valuable for any
self-determination measure to account for the changes that
adults undergo as they age.
The final problem pertained to the limited perspectives of
existing measures of self-determination of individuals with dis-
abilities. There were no self-determination measures represent-
ing the socio-ecological perspective. Considering that the
nature of disability can be understood as an intersection
between a person's capacities and the context in which that per-
son lives, it was valuable to explore the role of environmental
supports in improving the self-determination of individuals
with severe disabilities. Notably, the Korean version of the
Minnesota Self-Determination Scale (K-MSDS) was the first
instrument designed to assess self-determination of Korean
adults through the socio-ecological perspective.
The Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to examine whether a trans-
lated Korean version of the MSDS, the K-MSDS, might be
valid when applied to a Korean population. The original
scales were invented to measure adults with developmental
disabilities (Abery, Stancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg,
2000a). The measures were incorporated from the construct
of an ecological model of self-determination (Abery &
Stancliffe, 2003).
Research Questions
Research Question 1: Does the K-MSDS yield adequate
test­retest reliability correlations in an adult sample from
three Korean group homes and a residential institution at
two different points in time?
Research Question 2: Does the K-MSDS yield accept-
able internal consistency coefficients in an adult sample
from three Korean group homes and a residential
institution?
Research Question 3: To what extent is there correlation
between the K-MSDS and the K-Arc's SDS (K-SDS) in
constructing self-determination?
Method
Participants and Setting
Participants included 40 adults with intellectual disabilities
residing in three group homes and one residential institution
in an urban area of South Korea. The gender breakdown of
this sample was 24 males (60%) and 16 females (40%). The
age of participants was restricted to 19 or over, because the
MSDS was originally developed for use with adults. Mean
age was 31.5 years (SD = 6.36, range = 20-42). The ethnicity
of the participants was Pacific Islander (Koreans). Of the
participants, 28 were recruited from one residential institu-
tion and 12 were recruited from three group homes the direc-
tors of which agreed to participate in the study.
Participants lived in three different residential settings:
(a) group homes, (b) pre-group homes, and (c) a residential
institution. Twelve (n = 12) participants resided in three
group homes that provided semi-independent living services
in integrated community settings. Unmarried participants
shared a room with two to three other residents. Married par-
ticipants lived with their own family members in the group
homes. Twelve (n = 12) participants lived in "pre-group
home buildings" located within the residential institution,
but segregated from the community. The "pre-group home
Cho 3
buildings" were created to prepare individuals for the transi-
tion to living in an integrated community. Sixteen (n = 16)
participants resided in one residential institution which pro-
vided 24-hr supervised services. These individuals lived in
four-person rooms segregated from the community. Table 1
provides additional demographic information regarding the
participants in this study.
Structure of Self-Determination Construct
Wehmeyer, Kelchner, and Richards (1996) proposed a func-
tional model of self-determination. They defined self-determi-
nation as the attitudes and abilities of the individual to act as
the primary causal agent in his or her life. The primary causal
agent was based on four functional characters of behavior:
(a) autonomy, (b) self-regulation, (c) self-realization, and
(d) psychological empowerment. Thus, the model developed
by Wehmeyer et al. (1996) was called the functional model.
The measure assesses these four self-determination areas.
Abery and Stancliffe (2003) proposed an ecological
model of self-determination based on the work of
Bronfenbrenner (1979). They defined self-determination as
the degree of personal control which one wishes to exercise
over those areas he or she considers important. They present
personal control as heavily influenced by the interaction
between individuals and their environments. Thus, the role
of environmental supports was emphasized in the ecological
model. Abery and Stancliffe's (2003) measure assesses the
eight environmental support areas. Some examples of these
supports include home, leisure activities, friends, health, and
work (Abery et al., 2000a).
Measures
The Arc's Self-Determination Scale (SDS; Wehmeyer &
Kelchner, 1995) was developed to measure the self-determi-
nation of both secondary students and adults. This measure
was comprised of two forms: an adult and an adolescent
form, both of which share the same content. The adult form
was adapted from the adolescent form (Wehmeyer, 1996).
The internal consistency coefficient (Cronbach's ) was .90.
TheKoreanversionofArc'sSelf-DeterminationAdolescent
Scale (K-SDS) was developed by Kim, Cho, Moon, and Kim
(2001). The K-SDS was normed on 710 Korean adolescents
with and without disabilities. The internal consistency was .95
in the Cronbach's  (J. K. Kim et al., 2001).
Construct validity was established through a confirmatory
factor analysis which identified the consistent factors between
K-SDS (J. K. Kim et al., 2001) and the SDS measure
(Wehmeyer & Kelchner, 1995). The psychometric properties
of the measure were established by administering it to sec-
ondary students with intellectual disabilities. The internal
consistency (Cronbach's ) ranged between .92 and .95 across
the four Korean studies. The K-SDS was used for this study.
The MSDS (Abery et al., 2000a) were invented to measure
self-determination of an adult in light of the effects of certain
environmental factors. The MSDS consisted of three sub-
scales. These subscales included (a) Exercise of Control,
(b) Decision-Maker Preference, and (c) Importance of Control.
Each subscale included 90 items, grouped into eight domains,
which used a 3-point scale system to evaluate the levels of
self-determination of the individual. Item questionnaires for
the three scales shared the same content, with variation occur-
ring only in initial statements, such as "How much do you care
about . . ." on the Important scale, "Who decides . . ." on the
Exercise Control scale, and "Who do you want to decide . . ."
on the Decision-Preference scale. The MSDS included both a
self-reporting adult form and a proxy reporting residential

staff form, which share the same content. The proxy forms
were used for this study (Abery et al., 2000a). The test­retest
(Pearson's r) ranged between .74 and .87. The internal consis-
tency coefficient (Cronbach's ) ranged between .88 and .92
for the self-reporting scales (Elkin, 2007).
Procedures
The investigator obtained two types of consents; a signed
and an oral consent form. Signed consent forms were
obtained from directors of the residential institution and
three group homes, and legal guardians of the participants
who did not have families and relatives. Oral consent forms
were obtained from participants (i.e., residents with intellec-
tual disabilities). Written consent was waived for participants
who were not able to read the forms. The consent document
was communicated orally by a member of the research team.
Each participant was informed that participation in the study
was voluntary and could be terminated at any time.
Translation and Back Translation
The translation­back translation technique (also known as
retranslation) was used to ensure equivalence on the scale
between different cultures (Brislin, 1986; Brislin & Thorndike,
1972). The investigator of this study, who was fluent in both
Korean and English, translated the MSDS into Korean. The
Korean version was then retranslated into English by a Korean
doctoral student majoring in English Literature at the graduate
school level, and fluent in both Korean and English. The two
versions were compared by translation checkers--two other
doctoral students in English literature programs at the same
school--who were also fluent in both Korean and English.
These checkers were asked to rate how well the items on the
two versions of the MSDS aligned to the following criteria:
(a) linguistic likeness (e.g., word-to-word correspondence
between English and Korean) and (b) content agreement (e.g.,
delivery of the meanings from English to Korean. The trans-
lated-retranslated items were rated using a 5-point Likert-type
scale (1-5 points). The items that received ratings equal or
greater than a point of 4 on both criteria were retained. Items
that received ratings equal to or lower than a point of 3 on both
criteria were discarded for later retranslations.
Procedure
Face validity of the second Korean version of the MSDS was
rated by a Korean panel of three residential staff members
who served individuals with intellectual disabilities. Among
panel participants, the mean number of years serving intel-
lectual disabilities was 14 (SD = 6.36, range = 7-21). All par-
ticipants were certificated social workers.The panel members
were asked to rate how well the translated Korean items cor-
responded to institutional policies and practices in group
homes for adults with intellectual disabilities in South Korea.
Nine culturally inappropriate items were identified by the
panel on the first translated version and replaced with modi-
fied items applicable to Korean institutions serving individu-
als with intellectual disabilities.
Changes in the questionnaires were identically applied to
the three subscales, as they shared the same content. The con-
tent replaced on the questionnaires was comprised of five
items pertaining to the Plans domain, two items from the
Support Money domain, and two items from the Support Staff
domain. For example, the phrase transition planning meeting
in the Plans domain was replaced with "a personal discussion
with peer or family member," as transition planning meetings
did not occur in South Korea. The phrase "hiring or paying
the service staff" in the Support Staff domain was replaced
with "saving money for necessity" and "buying something for
the necessity" in the K-MSDS, as individuals who resided in
the group homes and residential institution were not able to
hire or pay the service staff in South Korea. Table 2 provides
sample updated items recommended by the panel.
Both the first and second translated Korean versions were
pretested with five individuals with intellectual disabilities.
The individuals better understood questionnaires in the sec-
ond translated version. The second translated Korean version
was used for this study
Administrations
Interviews were administered by six volunteers enrolled in an
undergraduate special education program in South Korea.
The interviewers completed a one-day training workshop
(6 hr) to acquire specific information regarding the protection
of participants' privacy, practices and policies in the institu-
tions, and procedures for administering the measures used in
the study. Each of the interviewers had an opportunity to prac-
tice the interviewing process through role-playing various
case studies. In addition, the investigator of this study leaded
two discussion sessions with interviewers to assess their com-
petence regarding the process of data collecting activities. The
discussion sessions each lasted for 2 hr and were first held
immediately after participants began to conduct interviews
and, again, later on in the process of conducting interviews.
Results
Test-Retest and Internal Consistency
Test­retest reliability (Pearson's r) was computed between
the first and second administrations of the K-MSDS by the
same interviewers with the same respondents. The time
interval between the two administrations was approximately
2 weeks (M = 14 days, SD = 2 days). Test­retest reliability
coefficients were (r = .94) for the Preference, (r = .89) for the
Importance and (r = .84) for the Personal Control Scales. All
scale scores on the three scales were significant at the
p < .001 levels (two-tailed). Test­retest reliability analyses
Cho 5
were also conducted for the domain scores. Test­retest coef-
ficients were strong between domain scores with the excep-
tion of two domains.
The internal consistency was analyzed for each of the
Preference, Importance, and Personal Scales using
Cronbach's  (Cronbach, 1951). Each of these scales demon-
strated a strong internal consistency: Preference (.99),
Importance (.99), and Personal control (.96) scales. The
internal consistency was also analyzed for the domains
within the three scales. Test­retest and internal consistency
correlations of K-MSDS are presented in Table 3.
Convergent Validity
Criterion-related concurrent validity of the K-MSDS was
examined using K-SDS (Kim, Cho, Moon, & Kim, 2001) as a
criterion measure. Pearson correlations (Pearson's r) were
computed between scores on the K-MSDS and on the K-SDS.
The K-MSDS and the K-SDS appear to assess similar con-
structs. Preference (r = .53), Importance (r = .52), and Personal
Control (r = .51) Scales were correlated with the K-SDS.
Scores on the K-MSDS also significantly correlated with
scores on the K-SMS, (Social Maturity Scale; S. Kim & Kim,
1998), an adaptive behavior scale (p < .001, two-tailed).
Preference (r = .53), Importance (r = .52), and Personal Control
(r = .53) scales were correlated with the K-SMS. Pearson's
correlations between the K-MSDS and K-SDS are shown in
Table 3. Also, correlations between K-SDS and K-MSDS
including the subscales are presented in Tables 4 to 7.
Discussion
One of the aims of this study was to examine the reliability
and validity of a Korean K-MSDS. Overall, the results

demonstrated that the K-MSDS had good psychometric
properties for validity, internal consistency, and test­retest
reliability. However, this study did not further explore the
possible effects of environmental characteristics--residence
size and type, guardianship status of adults with intellectual
disabilities, and the characteristics of staff who serve in com-
munity-based settings--combined with MSDS, examined in
previous studies (Stancliffe, Abery, & Smith, 2000;
Stancliffe, Abery, Springborg, & Elkin, 2000). Also, because
adults with intellectual disabilities do not retain any legal
rights as independent decision makers in South Korea, we
were not able to examine the effects of possible substitute
decisions made by these adults, and, therefore, could not
make comparisons with previous studies.
The items on the MSDS were adapted from the Institute
onCommunityIntegrationSelf-DeterminationOpportunities
and Exercise Scale (ICI-SDOES; Abery, McGrew, & Smith,
1994, as cited by Abery & Stancliffe, 2003). Family, teach-
ers, and staff who served children with disabilities were
involved as members of an advisory panel during the devel-
opment of the MSDS. In contrast, only the staff serving
adults with intellectual disabilities participated as panel
members of the K-MSDS. Thus, items on the K-MSDS were
restricted to reflect the opinions of the individuals with dis-
abilities and their residential service providers. For a wider
application of the K-MSDS beyond individuals with intel-
lectual disabilities who lived in community-segregated resi-
dential settings, more stake-holders such as family, teachers,
and service providers in community-inclusive settings are
recommended to participate as panel members.
The test­retest coefficients ranged from .84 to .94 for
the K-MSDS scales. The test­retest intervals (M = 14 days,
SD = 2 days) were similar to those (M = 16 days, SD = 6
days) of the original study (Elkin, 2007). The test­retest
intervals administered to individuals with intellectual dis-
abilities in two cross-cultural studies examined varied 1 to
3 weeks (Gonzalez-Gordon, Salvador-Carulla, Romero,
Gonzalez-Saiz, & Romero, 2002; Morin & Cobigo, 2009).
So a 2-week interval for the study is acceptable. The
K-MSDS showed higher test­retest estimates than the
MSDS data. These findings provided preliminary support
for the reliability of the K-MSDS applied to Korean indi-
viduals. The test­retest coefficients were particularly low
for the At Work domain, (r = .31). One possible explana-
tion for this, is that participants did not have an opportu-
nity to use employee's benefits--such as paid vacations, a
day off, or task training for new employees--as most indi-
viduals with intellectual disabilities were unemployed
(81.6%; Employment Development of Korean Institute,
2010). Individuals who had been employed were consid-
ered under-employed compared with those with non-
intellectual disabilities or those without disabilities
(Employment Development of Korean Institute, 2010).
Another explanation for this result relates to the difficul-
ties inherent in applying the concept of self-determination
to different cultures. Asian cultures, such as those in Korea
and Japan, emphasize family values and relationships
among community members differently from Anglo-
European cultures that value individualism (Zhang, 2005).
Because of existing cultural norms, it could be difficult for
individuals to request a change in their scheduled lunch
time or to express preferences for certain types of work.
They may express hesitancy communicating their own
opinions on first or second responding, as they fear break-
ing agency policy or losing better benefits by challenging
collective decisions.
Internal consistency for the K-MSDS ranged from .96 to
.99. These results were corroborated by the previous results
for the original MSDS administered by Elkin (2007), which
ranged from .88 to .92. These results indicated that K-MSDS
was an internally consistent measure across all the three
scales. However, we did not conduct a study examining how
well the original MSDS scales were translated to other lan-
guages and cultures. Thus, we could not compare the inter-
nal consistency values of this study with those of other
foreign language and culture-based translated versions of
the MSDS. An additional concern involved the use of the
coefficient--as the number of items increased, Cronbach's
alpha tended to inflate (Netemeyer, Bearden, & Sharma,
2003).
The criterion-related validity of the K-MSDS was evalu-
ated by examining the relationship between the K-MSDS
and K-SDS. The associations between the two measures
were moderate. The validity coefficients were .50, .50, and
.51 for the three scales of the K-MSDS and the K-SDS.
These results provided preliminary support for the use of the
measures with Korean individuals. These two measures of
self-determination provided different theoretical perspec-
tives; the K-MSDS relied on the ecological perspective
(Abery & Stancliffe, 2003), whereas the K-SDS is based on
the functional perspective (Wehmeyer, 1996). Therefore, the
criterion-related concurrent validity was anticipated as
related, but may not actually be as high because those scales
might measure the different self-determination characteris-
tics of the same individual.
Scores on the K-MSDS (r = .51-.53) were also signifi-
cant predictors of individuals'scores on the adaptive behav-
ior scale (K-SMS). These results validated the previous
study by Abery, Rudrud, and Arndt (1995) indicating that
adaptive behavior is closely related to self-determination in
individuals with intellectual disabilities (e.g., r = .86-. 89).
Weller, Watteyne, and Herbert (1994) explained that adap-
tive behavior and self-determination might share common
characteristics, such as making choices without being
forced, emphasizing individuals' interests, and modifying
environments based on individual judgments and percep-
tions of specific encounters. This study indicated that the
K-MSDS was a valid and reliable self-determination mea-
sure when applied to Korean adults with intellectual
disabilities.

Limitation
This study used a convenient sample consisting of 40 adult
individuals who participated voluntarily. This sample was
not representative of all individuals with intellectual disabili-
ties in South Korea. Interpretation of results should be
restricted to this study as generalization to other populations
cannot be made. Future studies to examine the technical ade-
quacy of the K-MSDS should extend the sample size of par-
ticipants to individuals from a wider variety of age ranges,
intellectual levels, and residential settings both community-
inclusive and segregated.
The use of the K-SDS adolescent form as the criterion
measure was a limitation of the study. There was no measure
to assess self-determination of adults in South Korea. Even
though there was considerable similarity between the Arc's
SDS, adolescent, and adult forms (Wehmeyer & Kelchner,
1995), there was no Korean study to support the similarity
between both adolescent and adult forms of the K-SDS.
The study requires the application of sophisticated statis-
tical techniques to clarify which environmental variables
existed and how much they contributed to enhanced levels of
individuals' self-determination. Stancliffe, Abery, and Smith
(2000) used path analysis to examine whether there was a
direct relationship between levels of self-determination and
various expected environmental predictors. They found four
prominent environmental predictors: self-determination
skills, autonomy, individualization, and a discretionary use
of money. Another study (Stancliffe, Abery, Springborg, &
Elkin, 2000) analyzed self-determination scores combined
with adaptive behavior skills and IQ tests to examine the
influences of different substitute decision-making statuses
on individuals' levels of self-determination. This method
was effective for controlling the compound effects because
adaptive behavior and IQ were identified as strongly related
to levels of self-determination. These studies provided con-
sistent support for the ecological perspective. Future studies
propose that the results of this study will be more convincing
when combined with the Environment Scale (Abery,
Stancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg, 2000b). The purpose
of the Environment Scale is to identify the environmental
features in which an individual lives.
Scale brevity may be a concern (Netemeyer et al., 2003).
The study used relatively long interview protocols with indi-
viduals with intellectual disabilities. The K-MSDS includes
270 items and requires approximately 3 hr to be completed.
Participants became less enthusiastic in the interviews as
time progressed. It is suggested that low levels of participant
enthusiasm influenced the results of the study. A shorter
interview period may increase the test­retest reliability.
Implications for Future Studies
Self-determination measures are used for developing, imple-
menting, and evaluating the effect of self-determination
interventions as stated by Shogren et al. (2008). There was
no self-determination intervention program for adults with
disabilities in South Korea. Future studies should focus on
the development of intervention programs for enhancing
self-determination in Korean adults. The data from the cur-
rent study identify the needs of individuals who are placed in
Korean group homes and residential institutions, and sug-
gests the need for designing and implementing intervention
programs.
Additional studies should include the administration of
the K-MSDS combined with the Environment Scale (Abery,
Stancliffe, Smith, Elkin, & Springborg, 2000b). The
Environment scale was developed for use in combination
with one of the MSDS. Its purpose is to identify environmen-
tal features in which the individual lives. This scale was not
included in this study. Use of the Environment scale will pro-
vide individualized information pertaining to what environ-
mental features enhance self-determination, which barriers
exist, and how they influence the individuals with
disabilities.
Future studies will include the exploratory factor analysis,
given the availability of a larger sample population. This
methodological approach will be more effective for detect-
ing factor structure and relationships among the factors
within the theoretically based-measures (i.e., the K-MSDS,
K-SDS).
