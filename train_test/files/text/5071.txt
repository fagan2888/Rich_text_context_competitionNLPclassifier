Noninvasive monitoring of disease
activity and complications in Crohn's disease
Special Collection
Introduction
Capsule endoscopy (CE) is the modality of
choice for evaluation of the entire small bowel.
For diagnosis of Crohn's disease (CD), the diag-
nostic yield of CE is higher than that of ileocolo-
noscopy and CT enterography, and overall
similar to that of magnetic resonance enterogra-
phy (MRE),1 though recent studies have shown
its superiority over MRE in the proximal small
bowel.2­4 CE is more sensitive than other modali-
ties for detection of proximal small disease and
subtle mucosal inflammation,2,3,5,6 and is more
acceptable to patients in comparison to MRE.7
CE can detect active mucosal inflammation in at
least 50% of patients with small-bowel CD in
clinical remission.6
The Lewis score or the capsule endoscopy
Crohn's disease activity index: which one
is better for the assessment of small
bowel inflammation in established Crohn's
disease?

Abstract
Background: Small-bowel capsule endoscopy (CE) is a prime modality for evaluation of the
small bowel. The Lewis score (LS) and the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's Disease Activity Index
(CECDAI) are validated endoscopic indices for quantification of small-bowel inflammation on
CE. It is unclear whether these indexes are interchangeable for the evaluation of mucosal
inflammation in established Crohn's disease (CD). The aim of this study was to compare the
quantitative evaluation of small- bowel inflammation by LS and CECDAI.
Methods: Patients with known quiescent small-bowel CD for at least 3 months (Crohn's
disease activity index < 150) were prospectively recruited and underwent CE. The LS was
calculated using RAPID 8 capsule-reading software and the CECDAI was calculated manually.
Cumulative LS (C-LS) was calculated by summation of individual tertile LS. Fecal calprotectin
(FCP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured and correlated with the scores.
Results: A total of 50 patients were included in the study. There was a moderate correlation
between the worst segment LS and CECDAI (Pearson's r = 0.66, p = 0.001), and a strong
correlation between C-LS and CECDAI (r = 0.81, p = 0.0001). CECDAI < 5.4 corresponded
to mucosal healing (LS < 135), while CECDAI > 9.2 corresponded to moderate-to-severe
inflammation (LS  790). There was a moderate correlation between capsule scores and FCP
levels (r = 0.39, p = 0.002 for LS, r = 0.48, p = 0.001 for C-LS, and r = 0.53, p = 0.001 for
CECDAI, respectively). CRP levels were not significantly correlated with either score.
Conclusions: CECDAI and C-LS are strongly correlated and perform similarly for quantitative
assessment of mucosal inflammation in established CD.

Currently two quantitative endoscopic inflamma-
tory indices are available for the diagnosis and
monitoring of CD. The Lewis score (LS)8 trun-
cates the small bowel into three tertiles (by small
bowel transit time) and assigns points to patho-
logical findings (i.e. mucosal edema, ulcers, and
strictures) characteristic for CD. Both severity
and extent impact the scoring of the findings. The
LS is incorporated in the RAPID reading soft-
ware for the PillCam SB capsule (Medtronic,
Dublin, Ireland). A score < 135 indicates normal
or clinically insignificant mucosal inflammatory
changes, 135­790 indicates mild inflammation,
and a score  790 indicates moderate-to-severe
inflammation. The LS was recently validated for
monitoring established CD.9,10 An additional
score known as the Capsule Endoscopy Crohn's
Disease Activity Index (CECDAI) is utilized for
the scoring of small- bowel inflammation on
CE.11 This score divides the small bowel into two
segments and includes degree and extent of
mucosal inflammation and presence of stric-
tures.10 In a previous study that included a mixed
cohort of patients evaluated for suspected CD, a
strong correlation between the indices (r = 0.68)
was demonstrated; the correlation of LS with
fecal calprotectin (FCP) was somewhat stronger
than that of CECDAI.12 However, the correlation
of both indices in the follow up of established
CD, as well as the correlation with inflammatory
biomarkers in this setting, has not been previously
evaluated.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to
evaluate the correlation between LS and
CECDAI, and the correlation of both indices
with inflammatory biomarkers for the evaluation
of established CD.
Methods
Patient population
The current study was a retrospective analysis of
prospectively collected data, as part of a larger
project aimed to identify predictors of clinical
relapse in patients with quiescent CD.6 The study
population included adult (> 18 years) patients
with CD with established small-bowel disease in
clinical remission or mild disease (Crohn's dis-
ease activity index < 250) that were in corticos-
teroid-free remission for 3­24 months and treated
with a stable medication dose (60 days for thiopu-
rines and methotrexate and infliximab, 30 days
for adalimumab and 5-aminosalicylic acid
agents). All patients signed an informed consent
and the study was approved by the institutional
ethics review board.
CE studies
In patients with isolated small-bowel CD, an
SB-III capsule (Medtronic) was ingested. In
patients with established ileocolonic CD, a colonic
capsule (PillCam 2 colonic capsule, Medtronic)
was used. A patency capsule (PC) test was admin-
istered to all patients with active small-bowel dis-
ease detected on MRE. If a PC was not eliminated
from the small bowel within 30 h, the patient was
withdrawn from the study. All images were
reviewed using the RAPID 8 software (Given
Imaging, Dublin, Ireland). Mucosal inflammation
was quantified using the LS.8 When a colonic cap-
sule was used, the small-bowel data were reviewed
and analyzed manually using the LS protocol,
while for the SB III capsule it was calculated using
the built-in calculator in the Rapid 8 software.8
Mucosal healing was defined as LS < 135, mild-
to-moderate inflammation as LS 135­790, and
moderate-to-severe inflammation as LS > 790.8
In addition to the traditional LS (derived from the
score achieved by the most involved tertile), we
calculated the cumulative LS (C-LS) by summa-
tion of the individual tertile scores. Proximal small
bowel was defined as the first or second tertiles in
accordance with small bowel transit times.
CECDAI was calculated manually using the pre-
viously published algorithm11 by a different
reviewer blinded to the LS results.
Inflammatory biomarkers
FCP levels were measured using the Quantum
blue calprotectin kit (BÜHLMANN Laboratories
AG, Basel, Switzerland). The reported value
range is 30­300 g/g.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were presented as means ±
standard deviations for continuous variables and
percentages for categorical variables. Categorical
variables were analyzed by chi square test/Fisher's
exact test and continuous variables by the Student's
t test/Mann­Whitney U test as appropriate. We
performed a Pearson correlation analysis for cor-
relation of both total and segmental CE and MRE
scores with each other and with FCP levels.

Correlation r values < 0.3 were considered as a
weak-to-low correlation, 0.3­0.49 as low-to-mod-
erate, 0.5­0.69 as moderate, and  0.7 as a strong
correlation [Fleiss, 1981].13 A two-tailed p value
< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The
analysis was performed using IBM SPSS statistic
(Version 20.0) (Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
A total of 50 patients who underwent CE were
included in the current analysis; 47 patients
(94%) were in clinical remission and the rest had
a mildly active disease. The clinical and demo-
graphic characteristics of the included patients
are detailed in Table 1. FCP or C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) levels were normal in 22 (44%)
patients. Of the patients included in the study, 5
(10%) were in small-bowel mucosal healing, 35
(70%) had mild disease, and 15 (30%) had mod-
erate-to-severe disease in the small bowel.
Correlation between LS and CECDAI
There was a moderate worst segment LS and
CECDAI (Pearson's r = 0.66, p = 0.001) and
strong correlation between C-LS and CECDAI
(t = 0.81, p = 0.0001) (Figure 1) for the entire
small bowel. We also evaluated the correlation
between segmental LS and CECDAI. Both in the
proximal (first tertile for the LS and first half for
the CECDAI) and the distal segment (third ter-
tile/second half) the correlation between the
scores was moderate (r = 0.53, p = 0.001 and r =
0.63, p = 0.001 for the proximal and distal small
bowel, respectively). We performed a linear
regression to identify the CECDAI cut-off values
that correlated to the established LS cut-offs.
CECDAI < 5.4 corresponded to mucosal healing
(LS < 135), while CECDAI > 9.2 corresponded
to moderate-to-severe inflammation (LS  790)
by linear regression.
Correlation of CE scores with inflammatory
biomarkers
There was a moderate correlation between both
scores and FCP levels that was somewhat stronger
for cumulative scores (CCECDAI and C-LS)
(r = 0.39, p = 0.002 for worst LS, r = 0.48, p =
0.001 for C-LS, and r = 0.53, p = 0.001 for
CECDAI). CRP levels were not significantly

Discussion
Our study demonstrated a significant correlation
between the two quantitative inflammation scores
on CE for monitoring inflammation in estab-
lished CD. Both scores have been available for
over 10 years, however it was not clear whether
one is superior to the other. Both LS and CECDAI
incorporate similar parameters (i.e. mucosal
appearance, ulcerations, and strictures) and
address both the severity and extent of the find-
ings.8,14 While LS is derived from the most
severely involved segment of the small bowel (of
the three tertiles divided by small bowel transit
time), CECDAI is a cumulative score that repre-
sents the summation of segmental scores for the
proximal and distal small bowel. Not surprisingly
therefore, when LS is calculated as a cumulative
score (C-LS) that summarizes the tertile scores,
the correlation between the two substantially
improved.
FCP is an accurate surrogate of the mucosal
inflammatory burden in inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD). In the recent meta-analysis of 19
studies, the pooled sensitivity and specificity
of FCP for detection of active inflammation
in IBD were 88% and 73%, respectively.15
Although it is currently unclear whether the
accuracy of FCP is similar in the small
bowel and the colon, the accuracy of FCP for
detection of small-bowel inflammation as dem-
onstrated by CE is well established, with a nega-
tive predictive value of > 90%.16 The correlation
of both the LS and CECDAI with FCP is mod-
erate, as previously reported.12 However, the
correlation is improved when LS is calculated as
a cumulative score; this is not surprising as a
cumulative score is more likely to represent the
inflammatory burden in the entire small bowel
and not just a given segment.
Mucosal healing is a major therapeutic goal in
CD, and is associated with a higher rate of long-
term remission and lower risk of complica-
tions.17 However, clinical trials in CD still
address mucosal healing by accessing the
inflammation in the colon and the terminal
ileum. In at least 50% of patients with CD there
is proximal small-bowel involvement that can be
visualized only by CE,2,18 while the degree of
inflammation in one segment may entirely mis-
represent the other.19 To date, very few studies
assessed the efficacy of medical treatment
in CD for healing the mucosa of the small
bowel;20­22 clearly, if CE is to become a stand-
ard tool for evaluation of mucosal healing in CD
trials, there needs to be a consensus regarding
the method for quantification of the inflamma-
tion. While CECDAI was designed specifically
for diagnosis and monitoring of CD, no cut-off
values for this score were established; on the
other hand, LS was recently validated for moni-
toring of the small bowel in CD with the original
cut-off values of < 135 for mucosal healing.
The main current advantage of LS is that it is

incorporated in the viewing software of the
PillCam capsules. This is the main advantage of
LS, however it appears that both can be used
interchangeably. The C-LS may potentially be
somewhat more reflective of the small-bowel
inflammatory burden than the traditional LS,
however it should be validated in further studies.
Recently, a new small bowel colon capsule has
been introduced in Europe, that is, the PillCam
Crohn's (Medtronic). This capsule will allow for
complete pan-enteric evaluation of the digestive
tract with a single diagnostic modality.23 This
capsule is a potentially ideal tool for repeated
monitoring in CD, in both clinical practice and in
future clinical trials. The software bundled with
this capsule will incorporate both the LS and the
novel quantification system for both small-bowel
and colonic inflammation.
In summary, our study demonstrates that both
LS and CECDAI are equally suitable for quanti-
tative monitoring of small-bowel inflammation in
CD.
