REVIEW
Analyzing Health Surveys for Cancer-Related Objectives
Barry I. Graubard, Edward L. Korn
Large-scale health surveys conducted by government agen-
cies record information on a large number of health-related
variables. We review the use of these data for performing
analyses that address cancer-related objectives. After de-
scribing the conduct of a large-scale health survey (the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
[NHANES III]), we discuss some of the issues involved in
analyzing data collected in such a survey. In particular, the
use of sample weights in the analysis and the importance of
accounting for the complex survey design when estimating
standard errors are discussed. Six applications are then pre-
sented that involve the following: 1) estimating demographic
factors associated with snuff use, 2) estimating the associa-
tion of type of health insurance with the probability of re-
ceiving a digital rectal examination, 3) estimating the asso-
ciation of body iron stores with the probability of later
developing cancer, 4) estimating the changing rates of mam-
mography screening in the United States between 1987 and
1992, 5) evaluating smoking and alcohol consumption as risk
factors for digestive cancer by use of a population-based,
case­control study, and 6) evaluating a randomized commu-
nity-intervention experiment to encourage smoking cessa-
tion. These applications use data from the National Health
Interview Survey, the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup
Study, the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey, and
the Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation.
The availability of public-use data files is discussed for sur-
veys sponsored by the U.S. government that collect health-
related information. We demonstrate that statistical meth-
ods and computer software are available for analyzing
public-use data files of surveys to address different types
of cancer-related objectives. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1999;91:
1005­16]
Health surveys provide a wealth of information about the
incidence and prevalence of diseases, the occurrence of healthy
and unhealthy behaviors, exposures to potential risk factors, di-
etary intake, physiologic measures of the population, and costs
and utilization of health services. The large sample sizes of some
health surveys, typically conducted by government agencies,
enable one to study relatively small--but important--
associations between variables, relatively rare events, and sub-
populations of interest. Since appropriate statistical methods can
make the results of an analysis of survey data representative of
the population sampled, repeated surveys of the same population
can be used to evaluate trends in the population. In addition,
follow-up of individuals sampled in a baseline survey allows one
to measure change at the individual level and to associate base-
line risk factors with the development of diseases. Table 1
presents examples of the wide variety of cancer-related analyses
that have been published using some selected health surveys.
In this review, we examine the use of data from large-scale
health surveys to address cancer-related objectives. The health
surveys that we consider are surveys that are representative of
well-defined large populations, such as the U.S. population. In
what follows, 1) we describe the design and conduct of such a
survey, the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III), for those not familiar with this type of
investigation; 2) we describe two aspects of survey data that can
complicate an analysis, the sample weights associated with the
observations and the clustering of the observations, and describe
the statistical methods that are used to handle these complica-
tions; 3) we present six applications involving different types of
cancer-related research questions and analyses using health sur-
vey data; 4) we discuss the availability of public use data files
for U.S. government-sponsored surveys that collect health-
related information; and 5) we describe some limitations of us-
ing survey data for analyses. The goal of this review is to in-
crease awareness of the types of health survey resources that are
available for cancer-related investigations and to encourage their
increased utilization.
CONDUCTING A LARGE-SCALE HEALTH SURVEY:
NHANES III
NHANES III is the seventh in a series of surveys that began
in 1960 to examine the health of the U.S. population (40). Its
goals are as follows [(40), p. 1]: "1) to estimate the national
prevalence of selected diseases and risk factors; 2) to estimate
national population reference distributions of selected health pa-
rameters; 3) to document and investigate reasons for secular
trends in selected diseases and risk factors; 4) to contribute to an
understanding of disease etiology; and 5) to investigate the natu-
ral history of selected diseases." NHANES III sampled approxi-
mately 40000 individuals during the period from 1988 through
1994 and cost approximately $100 million dollars to conduct.
The population sampled consisted of civilian, noninstitutional-
ized individuals, 2 months of age or older. In NHANES III,
sampled individuals were first interviewed in their homes. To
decide who to sample, if one had a list of all individuals in the
United States, one could imagine taking a "simple random
sample" from the list. This is equivalent to putting all of the
names in a hat and pulling out 40000 at random. However, this
would not be a practical sampling design because then inter-
viewers would have to travel to 40 000 locations dispersed
across the country. In addition, sampled individuals were asked
to go for a physical examination to a mobile examination center,
which could be set up at only a limited number of sites. There-

fore, rather than using a simple random sample, NHANES III
used a "multistage sampling design," in which 81 counties (or
sometimes two or more adjacent smaller counties) were first
sampled, and then individuals within each sampled county were
subsampled. The mobile examination centers needed to be po-
sitioned at only 89 locations, at which 300­600 individuals in
neighboring areas were examined over a 4- to 6-week period.
The 81 selected counties (or areas) were not chosen as a
simple random sample from a list of all such areas in the United
States. Instead, to decrease the variability of parameter estima-
tors based on data from the completed survey, large-population
counties were sampled with a higher probability than small-
population counties. Also, since one of the design considerations
of NHANES III was to provide reliable estimates for the Afri-
can-American and Mexican-American minority groups, counties
with larger proportions of these minorities were included in the
sample with higher probabilities. The sampling of certain sub-
populations with higher probabilities than others is a hallmark of
large surveys. NHANES III used "stratified sampling," in which
the units to be sampled were divided into a small number of
groups ("strata") and then sampled at different rates in the dif-
ferent strata.
For a sampled county, the second stage of sampling in
NHANES III involved sampling area segments consisting of city
or suburban blocks or other contiguous geographic areas con-
tained within the county. Segments with larger minority popu-
lations were sampled with higher probability. The third stage of
sampling involved listing all of the households within the
sampled segments and then sampling them at a rate that de-
pended on the segment characteristics, e.g., racial or ethnic com-
position. The fourth stage of sampling was to sample individuals
within sampled households to be interviewed. The probabilities
of individuals being chosen in this final stage of sampling were
based on their sex, age, and race/ethnicity. Because of design
considerations, only about one in five households sampled con-
tributed sampled persons who were interviewed.
The NHANES III household interview consisted of an indi-
vidual questionnaire for each sampled person, blood pressure
measurements for persons aged 17 years and over, and a family
questionnaire. The questionnaires contained questions about di-
etary intake and nutritional status, reproductive history and sex-
ual behavior, use of vitamin and mineral supplements and medi-
cations, tobacco and alcohol use, physical activity, health care
utilization and health insurance, and sociodemographic charac-
teristics. Sampled persons who completed a household interview
were invited to have a medical examination at a mobile exami-
nation center; transportation and a small cash payment were
provided. The examinations included additional dietary and
health interviews, body measurements, physical and dental ex-
aminations, venipuncture, urine collection, audiometry, x-rays,
electrocardiograms, spirometry, oral glucose tolerance tests,
ophthalmologic examinations, ultrasonography, bone density
measurements, cognitive assessments, and allergy tests. Exami-
nation data were recorded, for the most part, directly into an
automated data collection system.

the analysis are the sample weights associated with the data and
the fact that the data are clustered. In this section, we discuss
these characteristics and methods for accommodating them in
the analysis.
The data from each sampled individual are associated with a
sample weight, which estimates the number of people in the
population that he or she represents. To calculate these weights,
consideration is taken of the differential probabilities that indi-
viduals were sampled, so that individuals sampled from a sub-
group at a rate of one per 10 000 have larger sample weights than
individuals sampled from a subgroup at a rate of one per 1000.
Sample weights also adjust for the facts that not all sampled
individuals participate in a survey ("nonresponse"), and inad-
vertently not all individuals may have had a chance to be
sampled ("frame undercoverage"). These adjustments, which are
based on statistical models, are thought to typically lessen bias
due to nonresponse and frame undercoverage, but there are no
guarantees that they accomplish this.
The classic approach to analyzing data with sample weights
is to use (sample-)weighted estimators. Weighted estimation is
equivalent to performing standard (unweighted) estimation on a
new expanded dataset created from the original dataset of the
sampled observations by duplicating each observation the num-
ber of times given by its sample weight. For example, an indi-
vidual with a sample weight of 12 239 would have his or her data
appearing 12 239 times in the expanded dataset. Of course, there
are simple formulas for performing weighted estimation that do
not require actually duplicating observations. In addition, one
cannot calculate standard errors of parameter estimators using
standard nonsurvey formulas applied to the expanded dataset,
but other methods are required as described below.
The advantage of using weighted estimation over using un-
weighted estimation is that weighted estimators are estimating
population parameters and not parameters that depend on the
particular sample design used in the survey. In addition, un-
weighted estimation can sometimes give misleading results
when estimating cause/effect relationships (41). A disadvantage
of using weighted estimation is that parameter estimators can be
very variable when the weights are very variable, especially
when a few individuals have very large sample weights. Because
of this potential, there has been some debate in the statistical
literature concerning the role of sample weights in the analysis
of survey data [e.g., (42,43)]. Our own approach is to use
weighted estimation either when the analysis is primarily de-
scriptive (as opposed to investigating cause/effect relationships)
or when weighted estimation does not greatly increase the vari-
ability of estimators. Otherwise, we use unweighted estimation
with variables that are used to construct the sample weights
additionally included in the analysis model (44).
When estimating standard errors for parameter estimators by
use of survey data, one needs to take into account the fact that
the data are typically clustered. For example, in NHANES III,
there are a few hundred observations in each sampled county.
Since data from the same cluster tend to be more correlated than
data from different clusters, clustering tends to make standard
errors larger than would be obtained from a simple random
sample with the same sample size (45). (This problem is not
unique to survey data; analysts of animal litter data need to
account for the correlation of observations within litters.) For-
tunately, simple techniques have been developed to estimate
standard errors that require only a designation for each indi-
vidual of the cluster at the first stage of sampling to which he or
she belongs (46). [This is true provided that either the fraction of
first-stage units sampled is relatively small or the inference re-
quired is for the assumed model underlying the generation of the
data; see (47).] These first-stage sampling clusters are called
"primary sampling units." Public-use data files for most health
surveys contain the primary sampling unit designations of each
sampled individual. An exception is some institutional surveys,
e.g., the National Hospital Discharge Survey (48), where there
are confidentiality concerns in releasing information about the
hospitals (which are the primary sampling units). For these sur-
veys, approximate methods for standard error estimation involv-
ing "variance curves" ("generalized variance functions") have
been developed (46).
An alternative approach to estimating standard errors, which
might be attractive to a statistician unfamiliar with survey meth-
ods, would be to model all of the stages of sampling with fixed
and random effects [e.g., (49)]. However, we have shown on
theoretical grounds that such modeling, besides being overly
complex, does not automatically improve standard error estima-
tion (50). The one instance when simple survey methods do
require some modification is when the sample design is such that
only a small number of primary sampling units are available for
standard error estimation, e.g., 16 in the Hispanic Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (51). We have given recommen-
dations for this special situation elsewhere (44).
Fuller discussions of the statistical issues involved in analyz-
ing health surveys are given elsewhere (44,50,52­69).
APPLICATIONS
One can categorize analyses of health surveys for cancer-
related objectives in various ways: by type of outcome (inci-
dence of cancer, death from cancer, presence of a cancer risk
factor, and utilization of a cancer-screening modality), by type
of study design (cross-sectional, longitudinal, and case­control),
and by type of surveys used in the analysis (single cross-
sectional survey, single longitudinal survey, multiple cross-
sectional surveys of the same population, and multiple cross-
sectional surveys of different populations). The six applications
presented in this section were chosen to provide interesting ex-
amples of all of these categories and to demonstrate the different
ways survey data have been used to address cancer-related is-
sues.
We utilized the computer software SUDAAN (70) and some
of our own computer programs to perform the analyses. Other
commercial software designed for survey analyses could equally
well be used (71).
Factors Associated With Snuff Use, Derived From the
1987 National Health Interview Survey
Smokeless tobacco, i.e., snuff and chewing tobacco, have a
number of adverse health effects (72). By use of data from the
1987 National Health Interview Survey (1987 NHIS), a model is
developed to identify individuals at higher risk of using snuff
based on their characteristics. Such an identification could be
useful for targeting prevention initiatives. Table 2, A, contains
the estimated proportions of men aged at least 18 years old who
use snuff for each of the categories of a group of descriptive
variables. We see, for example, that snuff use is low in the
Northeast, in central cities, and among blacks and Hispanics.
The percentages in Table 2, A, are sample-weighted estimates,

so that they are representative of the U.S. civilian noninstitu-
tionalized population in 1987.
For some applications, the univariate descriptive analyses
given in Table 2, A, might be sufficient to address the relevant
issues, for example, suggesting areas to target for a national
advertising campaign to reduce snuff use. However, the results
in this table have a major limitation: They do not provide esti-
mates of the probabilities of snuff use for various combinations
of levels of the independent variables. One could approach this
by estimating proportions of snuff use cross-classified by more
than one variable, for example, for each of the 16 (i.e., 4 × 4)
cells defined by combinations of race-by-region categories.
However, the sample sizes in these cells may become too small
to yield reliable estimators of the proportions, especially if one
cross-classifies by more than two variables.
Instead of cross-classifications, a logistic regression analysis
can be used to model the probability of snuff use as a function
of the levels of all the independent variables (Table 2, B). For
example, by use of the estimated logistic regression coefficients
in Table 2, B, one can estimate the probability of snuff use as
5.2% for a 40-year-old white individual who lives in the South
in a non-Metropolitan Statistical Area, has 12 years of education

and a (family) income of $15 000, who is a white-collar worker,
and who has never been married. The interpretation of the in-
dividual regression coefficients in Table 2, B, is the same as that
for a logistic regression in the nonsurvey setting. For example,
the coefficient for a categorical independent variable not in-
volved in an interaction is the logarithm of the estimated odds
ratio (relative risk) of that category compared with the baseline
category. For example, the estimated odds ratio associated with
being unmarried is 0.88  exp(-.013). Note that this odds ratio
is less than 1.0, which is the opposite of what is suggested by
Table 2, A. However, the logistic regression result controls for
possible imbalances in the other variables (e.g., age) between
married and unmarried individuals.
Digital Rectal Examinations and Type of Health Insurance
Coverage by Using the 1992 National Health Interview
Survey
The American Cancer Society recommends annual digital
rectal examinations for individuals aged 40 years or over for
cancer screening (73). Of interest is the association of the prob-
ability that an individual has had an annual digital rectal exami-
nation with his or her type of health insurance; a full analysis
including other types of cancer screening is given elsewhere
(13). The third column of Table 3 shows the estimated propor-
tions of digital rectal examinations cross-classified by type of
health insurance, by use of the Cancer Control Supplement to the
1992 National Health Interview Survey (1992 NHIS) (74). In
terms of a causal association between health insurance and the
probability of examination, the observed proportions can be mis-
leading because they do not control for patient characteristics.
Thus, for example, the estimated proportion for individuals with
public health insurance may appear low because these individu-
als have a lower income, and income is positively associated
with the probability of examinations.
Column 4 of Table 3 shows the predictive margin for the
probability of digital rectal examination controlling for the de-
mographic variables given in footnote § of the table. The method
of predictive margins is a form of direct standardization by use
of a regression model and has been developed for handling
dichotomous outcomes analyzed with the use of nonlinear mod-
els like logistic regression (60,75). The predictive margin in the
fourth column of Table 3 represents the probability of an ex-
amination for a hypothetical population with the same distribu-
tion of demographic characteristics as the 1992 NHIS, but where
all of the individuals had each one of the health insurance types
in turn. Controlling for individual characteristics in this way, we
see that the estimated probability of an examination for the
public health insurance group is actually higher than the other
groups.
The predictive margin in the fifth column of Table 3 esti-
mates the probability of an examination for a population with the
same distribution of individual characteristics as the subgroup
with no health insurance, but where all of the individuals had
each one of the health insurance types in turn. This predictive
margin is relevant if one was contemplating what would happen
to the probabilities if the individuals with no insurance obtained
different kinds of health insurance.
Body Iron Stores and Risk of Developing Cancer, Derived
From the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study
The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I) was conducted during the period from 1971
through 1975. Individuals sampled who were aged 25­74 years
in this survey (or their proxies) have been periodically contacted
concerning their health status as part of the NHANES I Epide-
miologic Followup Study. This longitudinal study allows for
estimating the association of risk factors measured at the base-
line survey (and possibly updated with information from the
follow-ups) with the development of various diseases. This type
of longitudinal analysis could also be approached with a single
cross-sectional survey by asking sampled individuals for a his-
tory of their risk factors. However, longitudinal surveys have the
advantage that individuals sampled in the baseline survey--but
who later die--provide important information, whereas obtain-
ing information about dead individuals is problematic in a cross-
sectional survey. In addition, individuals in a cross-sectional
survey may not be able to recall accurately their risk factor
exposures from the past, and certain risk factors that require
immediate evaluation (such as blood chemistries) would not be
available.
In this section, we estimate the association of transferrin satu-
ration, a measure of body iron stores, with the development of
cancer. This association was previously studied as part of a more
general analysis (30). We restrict the analysis to the 1971­1974
cohort of NHANES I because the blood chemistry variables
were measured only for that cohort. Individuals with cancer at
the baseline survey are excluded from the analysis. Stevens et al.
(30) expressed the theoretical concern that preclinical cancer
might affect serum chemistry values and therefore restricted
analysis to individuals who were alive and cancer free for at least
4 years after the baseline survey. For the same reason, in our

viduals.
Table 4 shows the results of proportional hazards regressions
for the association of developing cancer with transferrin satura-
tion, smoking, race, income (family), and type of census enu-
meration district in which the individual lived. The same as in a
proportional-hazards regression used to analyze a randomized
clinical trial, the regression coefficient for a variable is inter-
preted as the logarithm of the relative hazard associated with a
change in one unit in that variable. So, for example, the inter-
quartile range (75th percentile minus 25th percentile) of trans-
ferrin saturation for men in this population is 13.7, and the
relative hazard associated with this difference is 1.22 
exp(13.7 × 14.29 × 10-3). Therefore, transferrin saturation is
positively associated with the risk of cancer for men; see also
Fig. 1. For women, the association is not statistically signifi-
cantly different from zero.
The analyses shown in Table 4 do not use the sample weights
because, for NHANES I, the sample weights are very variable,
which leads to very large standard errors of estimated weighted
regression coefficients. Therefore, we use unweighted estima-
tors but include as additional independent variables the variables
that were used in constructing the sample weights (race, income,
and enumeration district). The sample clustering is taken into
account in the analyses in Table 4, by the use of the primary
sampling unit designations of the individuals available on the
public-use data files.
Beside using the clustering in the data, there are some other
important methodological differences between the analyses
shown in Table 4 and the typical analysis of a randomized clini-
cal trial. (Since these differences are somewhat technical, some
readers may wish to skip the rest of this paragraph.) (a) In a
typical analysis of a randomized clinical trial, one would start
the time axis at the time of randomization, which is usually close
to the diagnosis of a certain stage of disease or the start of
treatment. The time scale here is taken as age rather than time
from the baseline survey because age is a more important de-
terminant of the risk of cancer than time from the baseline sur-
vey for a healthy population (65). (b) Note that transferrin satu-
ration is being measured only once for each individual, at the
time of his or her baseline survey. The possibility that transferrin

saturation means different things for individuals of different
ages is controlled for in the analysis by stratifying on 5-year
birth cohorts. (c) Individuals dying of other causes are consid-
ered to have their data censored at the time of death. Although
there are other possibilities, this "cause-specific" analysis is
most appropriate for understanding the biology of the associa-
tion (76).
The analyses shown here are based on the 1987 follow-up of
the NHANES I cohort; there was also a follow-up in 1992.
Beside follow-ups involving contacts with the sampled individu-
als, the National Center for Health Statistics is also providing
follow-up by use of the National Death Index (77) for this survey
and for some of their other surveys, e.g., the second National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. This type of follow-
up provides less information than a personal contact but can be
quite useful for studying associations with causes of death.
Changing Rates of Mammography Screening by Use of the
National Health Interview Survey
Many of the annual National Health Interview Surveys in-
clude supplemental questionnaires that contain questions on can-
cer-related topics. The questionnaires in the 1987, 1990, and
1992 surveys contained similar questions about mammography
screening (74,78,79), which we exploit to examine trends in
mammography screening. We focus here on women more than
40 years of age and on whether or not they reported a screening
mammographic examination in the last year. In particular, we
examine how the percentages of these women reporting a
screening mammographic examination are changing over time
and whether the time trends are different depending on the ed-
ucational levels of the women. Similar analyses with the 1987
and 1990 surveys have been previously performed (3).
Table 5 shows the estimated percentages of women reporting
screening mammograms, cross-classified by level of education.
The percentage of women reporting screening mammograms is
increasing over the years from 1987 through 1992. It also ap-
pears that the increases are similar for the different educational
levels. This could be formally checked by performing further
analyses, which could also control for additional variables, such
as race and whether or not the woman lived in an urban or rural
area.
An interesting statistical consideration in analyzing these data
is that, although the individuals sampled in each survey are
different, the estimated percentages given in Table 5 are not
statistically independent. This is because the same set of
sampled counties (primary sampling units) were used for the
National Health Interview Survey in the years from 1985
through 1994. This is taken into account in the joint analysis of
multiple years of the survey by use of the primary sampling unit
sample design for any one year of the survey when estimating
standard errors.
Smoking and Alcohol Consumption as Risk Factors for
Digestive Cancer Using the 1986 National Mortality
Followback Survey and the 1987 National Health
Interview Survey
We used data from the 1987 National Health Interview Sur-
vey (1987 NHIS) and the 1986 National Mortality Followback
Survey (1986 NMFS) to estimate digestive cancer death rates
and their association with alcohol consumption and smoking.
The 1986 NMFS is an example of a "followback" survey, in
which individuals associated with sampled records are inter-
viewed for further information. In this case, the records are death
certificates, but other followback surveys use other types of
records, e.g., birth certificates (80). In this section, we follow the
general approach of Sterling et al. (35), who used the 1987 NHIS
and the 1986 NMFS to examine the association of smokeless
tobacco with oral and digestive cancer mortality. These surveys
can be used together to estimate the death rates, where the nu-
merators of the rates are estimated from the 1986 NMFS and the
denominators are estimated from the 1987 NHIS. This is an
example of a population-based, case­control study. Two advan-
tages of a population-based, case­control study over a study that
is not population based (e.g., hospital case patients with hospital
control patients) are that many of the biases involved in choos-
ing an appropriate control population are eliminated, and one
can estimate death rates in addition to relative risks.
Because the information on deaths and alive individuals come
from two different surveys, biases can arise because the modes
of data collection of the surveys are different (mail response
from an informant for the decedent for the 1986 NMFS and
face-to-face interview for the 1987 NHIS) and the questions
asked are different. In addition, the populations sampled differ in
ways other than vital status. For example, the 1987 NHIS
sampled only civilians and noninstitutionalized individuals, and
the 1986 NMFS sampled deaths only for individuals aged 25
years or older. To make the populations sampled in the two
surveys comparable, the analysis is restricted to civilians aged
25 years or older who, if they died, were institutionalized less
than half of their last year of life.

Table 6, A, displays a univariate descriptive analysis of the
annual digestive cancer death rates cross-classified by sex, race,
age, drinking, and smoking levels. The outcome variable is death
due to digestive cancer in 1986, defined by an underlying cause
of death with ICD-9th Revision codes 150­159 (81). (The 1986
NMFS public-use data files include a variable coded for this
cause of death.) There were 785 such deaths sampled in the 1986
NMFS. Drinking or smoking information from 134 of the 785
digestive cancer deaths and from 1560 observations of the
19240 living individuals was partially or completely missing.
Rather than just eliminating from the analyses these observa-
tions with missing drinking or smoking data, we used a "hot-
deck" imputation to fill in their missing data with the data from
randomly chosen individuals with nonmissing data who were
similar to the individuals with the missing data [(82), p. 62­67];
each donor was chosen to be in the same age/race/sex category,
and, if available, the same smoking or drinking category as the
recipient. Imputation is a common technique in the analysis of
surveys to minimize potential bias in measuring associations due
to missing data. In the present application, in which the amount
of missing drinking/smoking data is larger for the 1986 NMFS
than the 1987 NHIS, the imputation also serves to keep the rates
in Table 6, A, from being biased low.
Beside taking account of sample design, there are two addi-
tional statistical subtleties in calculating the standard errors
given in Table 6, A. The first is that, even though we are only
interested in digestive cancer deaths, it is important not to just
delete the other deaths from the dataset when performing the
analysis. It can be shown that this will lead to standard errors
being estimated incorrectly (59). Instead, all of the deaths should
be kept in the analysis dataset and the subpopulation of interest
(e.g., digestive cancer deaths) should be specified in the code of
the computer software used for the analysis. The second subtlety
concerns the imputation for the missing data. The standard errors
shown in Table 6, A, treat the imputed data as if they were real
data and thus are underestimates. Unfortunately, to our knowl-
edge, at this time commercial computer software for surveys
does not exist that can properly take account of the fact that
some data have been imputed. However, calculations by use of
our own computer programs show that the effect on the standard
errors for this particular application are small (results not
shown).

Since the rates in Table 6, A, are not age adjusted (except for
the cross-classification by age), they can be misleading. For
example, individuals in the three smoking categories have mean
ages of 47, 43, and 57 years, respectively, so that the differences
in the observed cancer death rates could easily be due to the age
differences. A logistic regression analysis of digestive cancer
deaths was performed with the independent variables being sex,
race, age, smoking, and drinking (results not shown). By use of
this regression, we calculated the predictive margin for drinking,
smoking, and drinking by smoking (Table 6, B). When control-
ling for age, we see no association of smoking and digestive
cancer death rates (last row of Table 6, B). There is, however, an
association of drinking and digestive cancer mortality (last col-
umn of Table 6, B). The exact pattern of the association of
drinking and the rates seems to depend on level of smoking; we
have no plausible explanation for this pattern.
An early example of a population-based, case­control study
using separate samples of deaths and living individuals is given
by Haenszel et al. (83). They used a 10% sample of all deaths in
the United States in 1958 and information collected from a
supplement to the Current Population Survey in May 1958 to
study the associations of smoking and residence (urban versus
rural) with lung cancer mortality. Most population-based, case­
control studies do not sample deaths but use information on all
of the case patients in certain geographic areas (e.g., obtained
from tumor registries) and a sample of control subjects from the
same areas (e.g., by use of telephone surveys). For example,
Brinton et al. (84) attempted to interview all of the women who
were newly diagnosed with breast cancer during a fixed time
period identified by tumor registries in three geographic areas
and used telephone surveys of the same areas to ascertain the
control population.
COMMIT, a Community Intervention Trial of Smoking
Cessation
The Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation
(COMMIT) was an experiment in which one community from
each of 11 matched community pairs was randomly assigned to
a 4-year community level intervention to help smokers quit
smoking (85,86). The other community from each matched pair
served as a control for comparison purposes. The two commu-
nities within each pair were matched for geographic location,
population size, general sociodemographic factors, and esti-
mated smoking prevalence rates. Although there were multiple
objectives and analyses of COMMIT, we focus here on the
effects of the intervention on the prevalence of adult cigarette
smoking, one of the secondary analyses. These effects were
assessed by performing telephone surveys in the 22 communities
before and after the intervention, in 1988 and 1993, respectively
(87). The telephone surveys used list-assisted random-digit di-
aling, in which blocks of 100 consecutive telephone numbers
were first classified into two strata, depending on whether one or
more numbers in the block were listed in residential telephone
directories. Telephone numbers in blocks with residential num-
bers were sampled at a higher rate. The sample sizes and popu-
lation sizes of the community surveys were varied but averaged
about 4900 and 77000, respectively. The baseline surveys were
performed before the randomization.
Table 7 shows the estimated smoking prevalence for each of
the communities before and after the intervention. Averaged
over the 11 intervention communities, the smoking prevalence
went down 2.9 percentage points, from 24.6% to 21.6%. How-
ever, the smoking prevalence also went down in the 11 com-
parison communities an average of 2.7 percentage points, from
25.1% to 22.5%. The intervention offered a 0.27 percentage
point advantage in the lowering of the smoking prevalence over
the comparison, with a 90% confidence interval for this advan-
tage given by (-0.74 to 1.28). One can conclude that the inter-
vention did not have an impact on smoking prevalence beyond
the general decreasing time trends. This study reinforces the
importance of having a control group; without such a group, one
might have incorrectly assumed that the intervention was suc-
cessful in lowering smoking prevalence.
AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC-USE DATA FILES
If a survey is required of individuals living in a relatively
small geographic area, e.g., of the control population associated
with patient information obtained from a tumor registry, then
investigators can hire a private organization to perform the sur-
vey for them. This is also a reasonable option for a more widely
dispersed population if there exists a list of the individuals in the
population to be sampled, e.g., physicians who are board certi-
fied in a certain specialty. Obtaining national estimates for the
general population is a much larger undertaking. Fortunately,
many U.S. government agencies make the data available from
the surveys that they sponsor to investigators who are interested

in performing their own analyses. These data can be obtained in
computer-readable form at many university and government li-
braries or computer centers and are also available directly from
many government-agency websites.
The "Appendix" section contains a list of such surveys that
collect health information on a national scale. Some of these
surveys are focused on health information, whereas others col-
lect health-related information peripherally. We have not tried to
restrict this list to surveys collecting cancer-related information
because any health-related variable could conceivably be of in-
terest to a cancer-related investigation. We do not claim that this
list of surveys is exhaustive and suggest contacting the indi-
vidual agencies for further information about their surveys; see
also the FEDSTATS website (www.fedstats.gov) and the web-
site of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social
Research, Institute for Social Research, University of Michigan
(www.icpsr.umich.edu).
Besides the information collected in the surveys listed in the
"Appendix" section, investigators also have the option of col-
laborating with one of the government sponsors to have certain
required information collected in the future sample of one of the
continuing surveys. This approach is useful only for long-term
projects, since the time span for a national survey from idea for
data collection to data availability can be years.
Although the focus of this review has been surveys, it is
useful to note that health-related data are also available for some
variables on essentially the whole population. For example, the
National Center for Health Statistics makes available data files
that have information on every birth and death occurring within
the United States ("vital statistics"), and the Health Care Fi-
nancing Administration has information available on all Medi-
care claims in the United States. Interested investigators should
contact the relevant agencies for information about what re-
sources are available.
LIMITATIONS OF USING SURVEY DATA FOR ANALYSES
National health surveys will generally not contain sufficient
numbers of sampled individuals to estimate directly parameters
for small geographic areas, e.g., county-specific rates. Although
statistical methods, usually referred to as "small area estima-
tion," have been developed to estimate indirectly such param-
eters (88), for many applications it will be necessary to perform
a survey of the particular geographic area needed. This was the
situation in the breast cancer population-based, case­control
study mentioned previously, in which telephone surveys were
performed in the geographic areas where the case patients were
identified. National health surveys may also not contain suffi-
cient numbers of individuals in special populations (e.g., Native
Americans, the oldest-old) to perform analyses restricted to
these populations. Some surveys oversample some special popu-
lations to be able to provide reliable inferences for them. (It is
interesting to note that the use of sample-weighted estimators
allows one to also make valid national estimates from these
surveys despite the oversampling.)
It is sometimes possible to avoid the problem of small sample
sizes sampled by health surveys in local geographic areas and
subpopulations by the use of other data sources. For example,
the Current Population Survey, which is designed to provide
characteristics of the labor force, occasionally uses supplements
that involve health issues. An example is given by the Tobacco
Use Supplement that was added to 3 months of the Current
Population Survey during the period from 1992 through 1993
(89). (The Current Population Survey samples approximately
60000 households in the United States each month, which is
much larger than nearly all health surveys.) As mentioned pre-
viously, an additional data source is information on vital statis-
tics or other records that are kept on all individuals. If the re-
search question can be answered with these resources, then the
problem of small numbers can be avoided.
The availability of public-use data files from health surveys
and commercial software for performing survey analyses makes
it easy for investigators to address their research questions by
use of survey data. However, the ability to analyze survey data
should not lead one to ignore the principles of good scientific
method. In particular, given the large numbers of variables re-
corded in a typical survey, it is easy to examine a multitude of
possible associations and discover some spurious ones. In addi-
tion, except in the situation of randomized assignment of an
intervention (e.g., COMMIT described above), associations
found between risk factors and outcomes could theoretically
always be due to confounding variables and not be of a causal
nature. Finally, as is well known, statistical significance is not
the same as scientific importance. With large sample sizes of
some surveys, it is possible that an association between two
variables can be small, yet still be statistically significant (e.g.,
P<.05). Presentation of confidence intervals with estimates can
help avoid misinterpretations. With these caveats in mind, we
believe that there is tremendous potential in using health surveys
as a resource of addressing cancer-related objectives.
