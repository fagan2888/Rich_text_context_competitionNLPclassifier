Abstract: People's access to resources depends on their status as the owner of particular
items. To respect property, people need to remember who owns which objects. We test the
hypothesis that people possess enhanced memory for ownership relations compared to
unrelated objects. Participants viewed a sequence of 10 person-object pairs before
completing a surprise associative memory test in which they matched each person with the
previously paired object. We varied the description of the person-object pairs in the
instructions. Across three experiments, participants showed better recall when the person
was described as the owner of the object compared to being unrelated. Furthermore,
memory for property was better than a physical relation (bumping), whereas it did not
differ from mental relations (wanting and thinking). These patterns were observed both for
memory of items (Experiments 1 and 2) and perceptual details (Experiment 3). We discuss
implications for how people remember other people's property.

Introduction
The concept of property is a fundamental part of social life. In human societies, an
individual's access to valuable resources does not depend only on physical power but also
on the person's status as the "owner" of particular objects (Hobbes, 1651; Hume, 1740;
Locke, 1689). Human groups determine ownership using intricate property rules that are
much more complex than those observed in non-human animals (Brosnan, 2011). However,
for people to respect property, they need to remember who owns which items. Individuals
are surrounded by numerous objects with different owners. Moreover, people own objects
that are physically similar and distinguished only by subtle details such as different
people's pens, jackets, bicycles, MacBooks, or Honda Accords. These complexities raise

questions about how people maintain accurate representations of the property relations in
their social groups.
Previous studies have found a variety of psychological features that support
people's sense of ownership. Research suggests that people show better memory for items
they own compared to items owned by other people (Cunningham, Conway, Turk, and van
den Bos, 2010; Cunningham, Turk, Macdonald, and Macrae, 2008; van den Bos,
Cunningham, Conway, and Turk, 2010). People also value the same object more if they
own it than if they do not, termed the endowment effect (Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler,
1991; Jones and Brosnan, 2008). To determine ownership, people make inferences using
rules such as who was first to possess the item (DeScioli and Karpoff, in press; Friedman,
2008; Friedman and Neary, 2008), who invested labor in the item (Hook, 1993;
Kanngiesser, Gjersoe, and Hood, 2010), who grants permission to other people to use the
item (Neary, Friedman, and Burnstein, 2009), and who was necessary for acquisition of the
item (Friedman, 2010). Property transfers such as gift-giving, buying, borrowing, and
stealing are also characterized by systematic intuitions in children and adults (Blake and
Harris, 2009; Kim and Kalish, 2009; Olson and Shaw, 2011). Similarly, understanding the
implications of ownership, such as the owner's right to destroy their property, begins in
early childhood (Rossano, Rakoczy, and Tomasello, 2011). Finally, Constable, Kritikos,
and Bayliss (2011) found that ownership influences visuomotor processing; participants
were more careful when lifting the experimenter's mug, whereas they used more forceful
movements to lift their own mug.
Theories about the functions of property can help understand these empirical
observations. Researchers have proposed that the concept of property helps to resolve
conflicts of interest over resources (Gintis, 2007; Krier, 2009; Stake, 2004). These
proposals build on Maynard Smith's (1982) classic evolutionary model of resource
disputes, which shows that evolution can favor strategies that compete or acquiesce based
on an uncorrelated asymmetry: an asymmetry between disputants that is not correlated with
physical power. Maynard Smith examined the case of the bourgeois strategy, in which
individuals compete when they have first possession over a resource and they back down
when their counterpart had prior possession. The model shows that by respecting property
rules, individuals can coordinate their fighting decisions to avoid costly disputes such as
stubborn standoffs, heated arguments, or violence. Individuals who respect property gain an
evolutionary advantage over individuals who ignore the rules because they incur less
fighting costs (Maynard Smith, 1982). DeScioli and Wilson (2011) found empirical support
for Maynard Smith's model in an economic game in which participants disputed over
monetized resources. When resources were clumped in patches, creating the potential for
costly disputes, participants spontaneously developed a prior-possession rule to resolve
conflicts of interest. In contrast, when resources were distributed uniformly and costly
disputes were rare, no property convention was observed.
From the perspective of Maynard Smith's model, property is defined as a particular
strategy that uses coordination rules to reduce the costs of disputes. A coordination function
can encompass a variety of rules that differ in content and complexity (see also DeScioli
and Kurzban, 2013). Perhaps the simplest property rule is based on immediate possession
or physical contact between the individual and the object, and the next simplest rule is
based on physical proximity. These two rules have been observed in non-human animals
(Brosnan, 2011; Kokko, López-Sepulcre, and Morrell, 2006; Stake, 2004). In contrast,
Memory for property

there is limited evidence in non-human species for more abstract property rules that do not
require co-presence, such as prior possession or invested labor (Brosnan, 2011). A possible
exception is chimpanzees, which appear to recognize working for a reward as establishing
ownership (Brosnan, 2011). The idea that property functions as a fighting strategy shows a
common thread running from simple possession to the most complex property laws found
in human societies (DeScioli and Karpoff, in press). Different property rules found in non-
human animals versus humans and in one human culture versus another are all connected
as instances of a single underlying strategy for reducing fighting costs.
The present experiments add to previous research by looking at how people
remember who owns which objects. If ownership functions to allocate resources, then it is
critical for individuals to remember property relations so they can apply ownership
conventions. Hence, we test the primary hypothesis that people possess enhanced memory
when person-object pairs are characterized by ownership, compared to when the person and
object are unrelated. We test this hypothesis both for recall of items, such as remembering
John's scissors and Mary's keys (Experiments 1 and 2), and perceptual details, such as
remembering John's bicycle as distinct from Mary's bicycle (Experiment 3). Recall for
items is required for applying ownership conventions to different types of objects. Recall
for perceptual details is required for distinguishing among similar objects. Individuals in a
social group often need to distinguish ownership for objects that share the same category
and similar appearance such as different people's hammers, baskets, shirts, or wallets.
Memory for associations, such as owner-to-object, as well as for perceptual details,
such as distinguishing one bicycle from another, are challenging memory tasks because
they require a great deal of specificity in memory (Schacter, Gutchess, and Kensinger,
2009). Although general information often supports the distinction between a familiar item
and a novel one, memory for associations and details requires accurate binding together of
several pieces of information (e.g., color, orientation, size, owner information) into one
representation (Chalfonte and Johnson, 1996; Koutstaal and Schacter, 1997). Thus, finding
that ownership benefits these aspects of memory would provide strong support for the
salience of ownership information.
Further, we compare memory for property to other physical and mental relations
between people and objects. These comparisons can clarify the relative strength of memory
for property. Also, they can test alternative ideas about how the mind represents property
relations. We select comparison cases based on the fundamental distinction between
physical versus mental relations, and between desires and beliefs within mental relations
(Dennett, 1989; Frith and Frith, 2003; Hirschfeld and Gelman, 1994; Pinker, 1997;
Repacholi and Gopnik, 1997; Spelke and Kinzler, 2007).
For physical relations, we draw on the principle of contact, which is fundamental to
understanding inanimate objects even in young infants (Spelke and Kinzler, 2007).
Specifically, we look at bumping interactions in which a person contacts an object. We
selected bumping rather than terms for contact that could additionally imply mental
relations, such as touching or holding, in order to separate physical from mental relations.
For mental relations, we select desires and beliefs because they are basic and
distinguishable elements of people's understanding of others' minds (Frith and Frith, 2003;
Repacholi and Gopnik, 1997).
We take the general empirical approach that theories about shared psychological
mechanisms predict similar patterns of cognitive processing such as memory, attention, and
Memory for property

inferences (e.g., DeScioli, Asao, and Kurzban, 2012; Spelke and Kinzler, 2007). It is
possible that the human concept of property is built on simpler concepts such as physical
contact and proximity. If people represent ownership as a physical relation, then they will
show similar memory abilities for ownership and physical relations. Alternatively, the
concept of ownership might be more closely related to mental state representations (Frith
and Frith, 2003). If ownership is understood as a mental relation, then memory for
ownership will be similar to memory for desires and beliefs.1 We note that these
hypotheses are about whether ownership is primarily a physical or mental concept rather
than about which cues are used to infer ownership in a particular instance (we expect that
cues of ownership span both physical and mental domains).
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we showed participants a sequence of 10 person-object pairs
before administering a surprise associative memory test asking them to match the person's
face with the object from the previous pairings. Each person was paired with a different
type of object. For example, John was paired with scissors and Mary was paired with keys.
Across experimental conditions, we varied how the person-object pairs were
described to participants. To test memory for ownership relations, participants in the
property condition were told that each pair showed a person and an object that they own.
We compared performance to the unrelated condition in which participants were told that
each pair showed a person and an unrelated object. The property hypothesis predicts that
participants would show better memory for person-object pairs when the person was
described as the owner rather than being unrelated.
In three additional conditions, participants were told that the person bumps into the
object, wants the object, or is thinking about the object. The physical-relation hypothesis
predicts that ownership relations will show similar recall to physical relations. The mental-
relation hypothesis predicts that ownership relations will show similar recall to desire and
belief relations.
Materials and Methods
We recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.30)
using Amazon's Mechanical Turk website (Buhrmester, Kwang, and Gosling, 2011;
DeScioli and Kurzban, 2009; Horton, Rand, and Zeckhauser, 2011). We excluded
participants who omitted responses or previously participated in a property study, yielding
a final sample of n = 273 participants (age: M = 31.1, SD = 11.5 years; 65% female).
Participants read a short paragraph of general instructions stating that they will view
a series of 10 person-object pairs (see Figure 1). To draw attention to the photos,
participants were asked to write two adjectives for each face and each object before
proceeding to the next pair on the next page. After completing 10 person-object pairs,
1 There are of course more complex possibilities. Property concepts could combine, alternate between, or be
separate from both physical and mental concepts. Nonetheless, we motivate a simpler dichotomous approach
based on previous research showing a fundamental divide between physical and mental concepts (Pinker,
1997; Spelke and Kinzler, 2007).
Memory for property

participants were presented with a surprise associative memory test. The 10 face images
and names were displayed in a resorted order in the left column and the 10 object images
and labels were shown in the right column, independently resorted. Participants read:
In this section, please try to match the people you previously saw with the objects
they were paired with in the previous task. It is ok if you do not remember, just
make the best guess you can. We are interested in which pairings were the most
memorable and your guesses will help us find out even if you do not remember the
exact answer.
Participants answered which face was previously paired with which object by
selecting the object label from a drop-down menu next to each face. Chance performance
on this task is 10%, or 1 out of 10 correct.
Across conditions, we varied (between-subjects) one sentence in the initial
instructions and the headings shown over the person and object photos. In the property
condition (n = 56), the instructions described the pairs as "a person and an object that the
person owns." In the unrelated condition (n = 57), the pairs were described as "a person
and an unrelated object." In the bumping condition (n = 52), the pairs were described as "a
person and an object they bumped into." In the wanting condition (n = 54), the pairs were
described as "a person and an object they want." In the thinking condition (n = 54), the
pairs were described as "a person and an object they are thinking about." The headings
above the person and object were "Person" and then either "Person's object," "Unrelated
object," "Object person bumped into," "Object person wants," or "Object person is
thinking about" in each condition, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the results of Experiment 1. Overall, we found a significant effect of
condition on memory performance, F(4, 268) = 11.51, p < .001. To test the main
hypothesis, we compared the property and unrelated conditions. In the unrelated condition,
participants accurately recalled M = 2.95, SD = 2.31 of the 10 person-object pairs. In the
property condition, participants accurately recalled M = 5.41, SD = 2.90 pairs. Consistent
with the property hypothesis, recall in the property condition was significantly greater than
in the unrelated condition, t(111) = 4.99, p < .001, d = 0.94.

Percent Correct
We next compared property to bumping, wanting, and thinking. We found that
memory for property was greater than bumping (M = 3.94, SD = 2.69), t(106) = 2.73, p <
.01, d = 0.53. In contrast, property did not statistically differ from wanting (M = 5.96, SD =
3.06) or thinking (M = 5.54, SD = 2.90), all ps > .05.
These findings support the hypothesis that people have enhanced memory for
person-object pairs characterized by ownership rather than being unrelated. Moreover, the
data comparing property to bumping, wanting, and thinking provide evidence that recall for
property relations is better than physical relations and is similar to mental relations.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we repeated the previous experiment with two methodological
changes. First, the previous manipulation was subtle (a single sentence and heading). We
aimed to strengthen the manipulation by asking participants to additionally write one
sentence about each person-object relation. Second, after viewing the person-object pairs,
participants counted backwards for 30 seconds prior to the surprise memory test. This was
designed to reduce recency effects, which could add noise to the recall measures.
Experiment 2 serves as a replication of Experiment 1 and also tests whether these modified
methods will distinguish property from beliefs and desires.

Materials and Methods
We recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.35)
using Amazon's Mechanical Turk website. We excluded participants who omitted
responses or previously participated in a property study, yielding a final sample of n = 236
participants (age: M = 31.3, SD = 11.2 years; 55% female).
The procedures and conditions were the same as Experiment 1, with two
exceptions. First, in addition to writing adjectives for each photo, participants were also
asked to write one sentence about the person-object relationship in a specified format:
"John owns the scissors," "John is unrelated to the scissors," etc. Second, after viewing the
10 person-object pairs, participants entered a brief retention interval of 30 seconds during
which they were instructed to count backwards from 100 by sevens. They typed these
numbers into a textbox on their screen. Following the retention interval, participants were
presented with a surprise memory test.
Results and Discussion
Overall, we found a significant effect of condition on memory performance, F(4,
231) = 2.45, p < .05 (see Figure 3). We compared property and unrelated conditions to test
the main hypothesis. In the unrelated condition, participants accurately recalled M = 3.85,
SD = 2.51 of the 10 person-object pairs. In the property condition, participants accurately
recalled M = 5.13, SD = 2.67 pairs. Recall in the property condition was significantly
greater than in the unrelated condition, t(97) = 2.45, p < .05, d = 0.49 (all reported p values
are for two-tail tests).

Percent Correct
Compared to a physical relation, the difference between property and bumping (M =
4.43, SD = 2.69) showed a trend in the predicted direction that was not statistically
significant, t(98) = 1.30, p = .19, d = 0.26. Compared to mental relations, property did not
statistically differ from wanting (M = 4.91, SD = 2.88) or thinking (M = 5.55, SD = 2.94),
all ps > .05.
In sum, these findings largely replicated the pattern observed in Experiment 1, with
the exception of a non-significant trend for the property-bumping difference. Recall for
Memory for property

property was better than for unrelated objects, replicating the main result from Experiment
1. Also, memory for property did not differ from wanting and thinking, as observed in
Experiment 1. The absence of a property-bumping difference gives mixed evidence across
Experiments 1 and 2 for the physical-relation hypothesis.
Experiment 3
In Experiment 3, we examine participants' memory for the details of an object. In
the previous two experiments, each person was paired with a different type of object. Thus,
participants could associate people with broad classes of objects such as scissors or keys. In
Experiment 3, we assessed memory for perceptual details of objects by matching each
person with a different exemplar of the same type of object (bicycle). For example, John is
matched with one style of bicycle (red color, drop handlebars, etc.) and Mary is matched
with another style of bicycle (white color, flat handlebars, etc.). This allows us to test
whether people use the details of an object to remember ownership relations.
Experiment 3 provides a more demanding test of the efficacy of ownership in
memory. Remembering item details requires more elaborated memory traces than memory
for items in general. Previous work indicates that making ownership-related judgments
about oneself or an intimate close other enhances memory for both items and their
perceptual details (Hamami, Serbun, and Gutchess, 2011; Serbun, Shih, and Gutchess,
2011). We test whether objects owned by unknown individuals also show enhancements
for both item and details.
Participants viewed a sequence of 10 person-bike pairs before receiving a surprise
memory test asking them to match the person's face with the bike from the previous
pairing. As in the previous studies, we varied whether the pairs were described as property,
unrelated, bumping, wanting, or thinking. The property hypothesis predicts that participants
will show greater recall for details when the pairing is described as property compared to
unrelated. The physical-relation and mental-relation hypotheses predict that recall
performance for ownership will be similar to performance for physical and mental
relations, respectively.
Materials and Methods
We recruited participants online to complete a short study for payment ($0.35)
using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We excluded participants who omitted responses or
previously participated in a property study, yielding a final sample of n = 258 participants
(age: M = 33.3, SD = 12.5 years; 56% female).
The procedures and conditions were the same as Experiment 2, with one exception:
Each object was a different bicycle. On the memory test, the 10 bikes were presented
alongside an assigned number and participants were asked to match the faces to the number
of the bike the face was previously paired with.
Results and Discussion
Overall, we found a significant effect of condition on memory performance, F(4,
253) = 2.44, p < .05 (see Figure 4). As expected, the results generally indicate that
Memory for property

remembering details is more difficult than remembering items. Percent correct ranged from
25­40% across conditions in Experiment 3, compared to 30­60% in Experiments 1 and 2.
We compared property and unrelated conditions to test the main hypothesis. In the
unrelated condition, participants accurately recalled M = 2.64, SD = 1.63 of the 10 person-
bike pairs. In the property condition, participants accurately recalled M = 3.73, SD = 2.55
person-object pairs. Recall in the property condition was significantly greater than the
unrelated condition, t(113) = 2.70, p = .01, d = 0.42.

We also found that memory for property was greater than bumping (M = 2.80, SD =
1.80), t(103) = 2.09, p < .05, d = 0.42. In contrast, property did not statistically differ from
wanting (M = 3.25, SD = 2.00) or thinking (M = 3.07, SD = 2.00), all ps > .05.
In sum, Experiment 3 found the same pattern for people's recall of object details
that was observed for recall of items in Experiments 1 and 2. Memory for property was
better than for unrelated and bumping, and did not differ from the mental states of wanting
and thinking.
General Discussion
In three experiments, we found that memory for person-object pairs was improved
when the person was described as the owner of the object compared to being unrelated to
the object. We observed this effect on two different memory tasks: one assessing memory
for items (Experiments 1 and 2) and another assessing memory for perceptual details
(Experiment 3). These observations illuminate how people distinguish who owns which
items as well as how they discriminate among similar possessions such as one person's
bicycle versus another person's bicycle.
These experiments also provide suggestive evidence about how people represent
property. In Experiments 1 and 3, we found greater recall performance for property than for
a basic physical relation of bumping, contradicting the physical-relation hypothesis that
ownership is processed and encoded similar to physical relations; however, this property-
bumping difference was a non-significant trend in Experiment 2, providing mixed evidence
overall for the physical-relation hypothesis. For mental relations, memory for property did
Memory for property

not differ from wanting or thinking. These observations support the idea that property is
conceptualized as a mental relation.
However, there are alternative interpretations of the results for mental and physical
relations. First, mental relations such as wanting and thinking might be cues for (current or
future) ownership. Participants might have inferred ownership from people's mental states
of wanting and thinking, particularly because participants had little other information about
the people and objects. In this case, similar memory occurred not because ownership is a
mental state concept but because cues about mental states activated property concepts.
Second, the results might be affected by the presentation of the stimuli as static images
rather than dynamic events, which could interfere with the processing of physical relations
more than mental relations. Third, bumping and thinking might differ in other relevant
respects such as bumping potentially being perceived as more transitory than thinking.
Although the present evidence is suggestive, additional tests using different cognitive tasks
are needed to determine whether property is represented as a mental relation.
Our results add to previous investigations describing cognitive abilities in adults,
children, and non-human primates that support the sense of ownership (e.g., Brosnan, 2011;
Cunningham et al., 2010; DeScioli and Wilson, 2011; Friedman and Neary, 2008; Olson
and Shaw, 2011). The present experiments show a cognitive ability to remember other
people's property. This ability can support the functions of ownership by helping people
remember who owns which items. By tracking ownership status, people can use ownership
to allocate valuable resources while saving the costs of lengthy debates, hostile arguments,
and possibly violence (Gintis, 2007; Krier, 2009; Maynard Smith, 1982; Stake, 2004).
Previous research has shown that people remember objects they own better than
objects owned by someone else (Cunningham et al., 2008, 2010; van den Bos et al., 2010).
This finding is consistent with theories of property because individuals need to remember
which objects they own in order to recognize their privileged access to these items.
However, people also need to remember other people's property in order to avoid
provoking an owner's hostility. Consistent with this idea, our results show a memory
advantage for other people's property.
Previous research has also found improved memory for items and details when
participants made ownership-related judgments (Hamami et al., 2011; Serbun et al., 2011).
Specifically, participants decided whether they would buy an item, whether a close other
would buy an item, and whether an unknown (but familiar) person would buy an item.
Recall of the item and its details was better when participants decided about themselves and
a close other, compared to an unknown person. The present experiments build on this
previous work by comparing property to non-property relations. The results reveal
improved memory for unknown individuals' property when compared to unrelated pairs
and physical relations.
An important limitation of the current studies is that, like many experiments in
cognitive psychology, the task is stylized and abstract compared to natural environments.
Participants were presented with strangers associated with objects in rapid succession. In
naturalistic settings, people usually have the benefit of background knowledge about
familiar people and richer interactions with objects. This suggests that in natural situations
there might be greater differentiation in memory among ownership, unrelated, physical, and
mental associations.

Property is a core element of human social life and is also the foundation of
economic institutions (Demsetz, 1967; Ellickson, 1991; Kimbrough, 2011; Kimbrough,
Smith, and Wilson, 2008, 2010; North, 1981; Ostrom, 1990). The concept of ownership can
be understood as part of a strategy for reducing the costs of disputes over access to
resources--a strategy that is present in non-human animal species but especially elaborated
in humans (Brosnan, 2011; DeScioli and Karpoff, in press; Gintis, 2007; Krier, 2009;
Maynard Smith, 1982; Stake, 2004). Successful performance of ownership strategies
requires cognitive abilities for acquiring and organizing relevant information to accurately
track ownership. Future research can continue to investigate ownership strategies to
uncover the psychological abilities that support people's respect for property.
