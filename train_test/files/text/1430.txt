Frequency of Blood Glucose Monitoring
in Relation to Glycemic Control in
Patients With Type 2 Diabetes
MAUREEN I. HARRIS, PHD, MPH
OBJECTIVE -- The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between blood glu-
cose level, measured as HbA1c
, and frequency of self-monitoring in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Daily self-monitoring is believed to be important for patients treated with insulin or oral agents
to detect asymptomatic hypoglycemia and to guide patient and provider behavior toward reach-
ing blood glucose goals.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A national sample of patients with type 2
diabetes was studied in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Data on
therapy for diabetes, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose, and HbA1c
values were
obtained by structured questionnaires and by clinical and laboratory assessments.
RESULTS -- According to the data, 29% of patients treated with insulin, 65% treated with
oral agents, and 80% treated with diet alone had never monitored their blood glucose or
monitored it less than once per month. Self-monitoring at least once per day was practiced by
39% of those taking insulin and 5­6% of those treated with oral agents or diet alone. For all
patients combined, the proportion of patients who tested their blood glucose increased with an
increasing HbA1c
value. However, when examined by diabetes therapy category, there was little
relationship between HbA1c
value and the proportion testing at least once per day or the
proportion testing at least once per week.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes, the increase
in frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose with increasing HbA1c
value was associated with
the higher proportion of insulin-treated patients in higher HbA1c
categories. Within diabetes
therapy categories, the frequency of self-monitoring was not related to glycemic control, as
measured by HbA1c
level.

Self-monitoring of blood glucose is
believed to be a useful component of
patient self-care practices. For pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes, the American
Diabetes Association (ADA) position is
that daily self-monitoring is especially im-
portant for those treated with insulin or
oral agents to monitor for and prevent
asymptomatic hypoglycemia (1). Self-
monitoring is also suggested for these pa-
tients to facilitate reaching blood glucose
goals, although the role of self-monitoring
in diet-treated patients with type 2 diabe-
tes is not specified by the ADA (1). Given
the two-fold objective of monitoring glu-
cose levels at both the low and high ends
of the spectrum, it might be expected that
monitoring might be more frequent for
those with lower and those with higher
blood glucose values compared with pa-
tients in the intermediate range. We in-
vestigated the relationship between blood
glucose level, measured as HbA1c
, and the
frequency of self-monitoring in a nation-
wide sample of patients with type 2 dia-
betes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data were analyzed
from the third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III),
in which questionnaire, clinical, and lab-
oratory data were obtained for a repre-
sentative sample of adults with type 2
diabetes. NHANES III was conducted
from September 1988 to October 1994
and included a stratified probability sam-
ple of the civilian noninstitutionalized
U.S. population (2). Participants were in-
terviewed in their homes and were given a
standardized set of examinations and lab-
oratory measurements in a mobile exam-
ination center. There were 16,993
participants aged 25 years, of whom
1,608 had been diagnosed with diabetes
by a physician before the survey. Women
with diabetes diagnosed only during
pregnancy (n  105) and subjects with
type 1 diabetes, defined as those with age
at diagnosis 30 years who had continu-
ous insulin use since diagnosis of diabetes
(n  23), were excluded from analysis.
The remaining 1,480 subjects were con-
sidered to have type 2 diabetes.
Information was obtained by struc-
tured questionnaires on diabetes therapy
and blood glucose self-monitoring. Mea-
surement of HbA1c
was made during a
separate clinical examination in which
88.2% of the interviewed subjects partic-
ipated (3). HbA1c
was measured by a
high-performance liquid chromato-
graphic assay as used in the Diabetes Con-
trol and Complications Trial. The upper
limit of normal for HbA1c
in the assay sys-
tem is 6.1%, defined as the mean  2 SDs
(5.27  0.86%) for the group of people
with fasting plasma glucose 110 mg/dl
and 2-h postchallenge glucose 140 mg/
dl. This value (6.1%) is virtually identical
to the upper limit of normal (6.0%) rec-
ommended by the ADA using the same
assay system (1). Statistical analyses were
performed using SAS (Statistical Analysis

vey sampling weights. Logistic regression
was performed using SUDAAN (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC) to assess the relationship be-
tween HbA1c
and self-monitoring in those
treated with insulin, oral agents, or diet
alone.
RESULTS -- The median age of the pa-
tients was 62.5 years. About 44% were
male, 26% were of minority race or eth-
nicity, 55% had a high school education
or more, 93% had health insurance, 96%
had a regular source of primary medical
care, and 85% had at least two physician
visits in the 12 months before the survey.
Table 1 shows HbA1c
values and
the frequency of blood glucose self-
monitoring, according to diabetes ther-
apy. One-fourth of patients treated with
insulin and most patients treated with
oral agents or diet alone had never moni-
tored their blood glucose or monitored
it less than once per month. Self-
monitoring at least once per day was prac-
ticed by 39% of those taking insulin and
was infrequent for those treated with oral
agents or diet alone.
In Fig. 1, the patients are distributed
according to deciles of HbA1c
. The per-
centage of patients in each decile who
were treated with insulin rises with in-
creasing HbA1c
value. The percentage
treated with oral agents is relatively con-
stant across deciles 3­10, and the per-
centage treated with diet alone declines
markedly with increasing HbA1c
value.
The frequency of self-monitoring by
patients in each decile of the HbA1c
dis-
tribution is shown in Fig. 1. The propor-
tion of patients who tested at least once
per week or who tested at least once per
day increased with increasing HbA1c
value. Testing at least twice per day was
uncommon and showed no relation to
HbA1c
value.
Figure 2 illustrates the frequency of
self-monitoring by patients for those
treated with insulin, oral agents, or diet
alone in each quintile of the HbA1c
distri-
bution. There was little relationship be-
tween HbA1c
value and the proportion
testing at least once per week for those
treated with insulin or oral agents, al-
though, for those treated with diet alone,
the test frequency was higher in the high-
est two quintiles of HbA1c
(comprising
14% of diet-treated patients). The pro-

portion testing at least once per day was
lower in the middle quintile for those tak-
ing insulin, but there was no relationship
to HbA1c
for those treated with oral agents
or diet alone. The proportion testing at
least twice per day was highest in the low-
est quintile for those taking insulin (8% of
insulin-treated patients) and was low
throughout the spectrum of HbA1c
for
those taking oral agents or treated with
diet alone.
Logistic regression models were con-
structed to further evaluate the associa-
tion of self-monitoring and HbA1c
. In
these models, there was no relationship
between the frequency of self-monitoring
and HbA1c
level for those treated with in-
sulin, oral agents, or diet alone (P  0.5).
CONCLUSIONS -- The data for all
patients combined indicate that self-
monitoring of blood glucose is more com-
mon as HbA1c
increases, suggesting that
patients with poorer glycemic control
have a greater tendency to self-monitor.
However, the increase in frequency of
self-monitoring with increasing HbA1c
value is related to the higher proportion of
insulin-treated patients, who are more
likely to self-monitor, in higher HbA1c
categories. Within each diabetes therapy
category there was little relationship be-
tween the frequency of testing and HbA1c
value. Indeed, half of patients with HbA1c
8%, the ADA value at which intensifi-
cation of glucose control is recommended
(1), monitored less than once per week.
Prior studies have shown that self-
monitoring is more common in Cauca-
sian patients than in African-American or
Mexican-American patients (3,4). Those
with more education, those who have had
a diabetes patient education class, and
those who have frequent physician visits
are more likely to practice self-monitoring
(4). However, self-monitoring was not re-
lated to higher income or to having health
insurance (4).
The relationship between HbA1c
value and self-monitoring frequency was
investigated in a study in England of 290
type 2 diabetic patients treated with insu-
lin; no association was found (5). A study
in Missouri of 61 type 2 diabetic patients
who self-monitored found no difference
in mean GHb values based on the fre-
quency of testing (6). Among 115 patients
treated with oral agents at a Veterans Ad-
ministration Medical Center in Arizona,
glucose control was independent of the
number of blood glucose test strips dis-
pensed (7). Some reports have questioned
the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients
with type 2 diabetes (8,9). In contrast, the
importance of self-monitoring in patients
with type 1 diabetes is more certain, and
an increased frequency of self-monitoring
is generally associated with decreased
HbA1c
values for these patients (5,10).
Self-monitoring is considered to be a
tool to guide patient and physician action
with respect to changes in diet, physical
activity, and use of antihyperglycemic
medication. Both patient and physician ac-
tion are needed to change diabetes man-
agement when hyperglycemia is evident.
Patients with differing levels of insulin re-
sistance and -cell reserve may respond
differently to self-monitoring and changes
in diabetes control regimens. The true im-
pact of self-monitoring could be assessed
in a randomized clinical trial with pre-
established guidelines for how glucose
monitoring results would be used to facil-
itate achievement of glycemic targets.
Adequate co-involvement of the med-
ical care team, the patient, and the family
appears to be important in effective man-
agement of diabetes. Clinical trials have
demonstrated that health care systems
that utilize nurses and other nonphysi-
cian personnel as case managers and
those with telephone-based contact are
efficacious in improving glycemic con-
trol, blood pressure, and lipid levels (11­
14). Key elements in the success of the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial
were the frequent clinic visits involving
nurses and dietitians and the extensive
telephone access to these health care prac-
titioners. These elements were afforded to
patients in the intensive intervention
group, and HbA1c
remained low through-
out the study (15). Availability of social
support, such as that provided by nurse
case-managers, appears to be a major
factor that contributes to adherence by
diabetic patients to such behaviors as fol-
lowing a diabetic diet, weight loss, taking
prescribed medications, checking blood
glucose, and checking feet (16). In a lo-
gistic regression analysis of the NHANES
III type 2 diabetic patients, the HbA1c
level
was not significantly associated with having
a primary source of ambulatory medical
care, the number of physician visits per
year, having any type of health insurance,
or having private insurance (17).
The NHANES III is a cross-sectional
study, and it cannot be determined from
this study whether self-monitoring influ-
enced blood glucose control. Further-
more, the study was conducted during
the period when Medicare reimbursed the
cost of blood glucose monitors and test
strips for monitors only for patients
treated with insulin. Although self-testing
of blood glucose does not require moni-
tors, it is likely that the lower frequency of
testing by patients treated with oral agents
and diet alone was a result, in part, of the
lack of reimbursement. In 1998, this pol-

ing to diabetes therapy. The mean  SD HbA1c
for nondiabetic subjects is 5.27  0.43%. In lo-
gistic regression, there was no relationship be-

icy was changed to reimburse patients for
these items, regardless of whether the pa-
tient is treated with insulin. In a survey
conducted in 1997­1999, the proportion
of all diabetic patients who self-
monitored at least once per day was 44%
(18), which was higher than that seen in
NHANES III.
