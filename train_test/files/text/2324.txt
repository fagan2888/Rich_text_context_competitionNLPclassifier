ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Trends in Physician Referrals in the United States,
1999-2009
Michael L. Barnett, MD; Zirui Song, BA; Bruce E. Landon, MD, MBA
Background: Physician referrals play a central role in
ambulatory care in the United States; however, little is
known about national trends in physician referrals over
time. The objective of this study was to assess changes
in the annual rate of referrals to other physicians from
physician office visits in the United States from 1999 to
2009.
Methods: We analyzed nationally representative cross-
sections of ambulatory patient visits in the United States,
using a sample of 845 243 visits from the National Am-
bulatory Medical Care Survey and National Hospital Am-
bulatory Medical Care Survey from 1993 to 2009, focus-
ing on the decade from 1999 to 2009. The main outcome
measures were survey-weighted estimates of the total
number and percentage of visits resulting in a referral to
another physician across several patient and physician
characteristics.
Results: From 1999 to 2009, the probability that an am-
bulatory visit to a physician resulted in a referral to an-
other physician increased from 4.8% to 9.3% (P.001),
a 94% increase. The absolute number of visits resulting
in a physician referral increased 159% nationally during
this time, from 41 million to 105 million. This trend was
consistent across all subgroups examined, except for
slower growth among physicians with ownership stakes
in their practice (P=.02) or those with the majority of
income from managed care contracts (P=.007). Changes
in referral rates varied according to the principal symp-
toms accounting for patients' visits, with significant in-
creases noted for visits to primary care physicians from
patients with cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, orthope-
dic, dermatologic, and ear/nose/throat symptoms.
Conclusions: The percentage and absolute number of
ambulatory visits resulting in a referral in the United States
grew substantially from 1999 to 2009. More research is
necessary to understand the contribution of rising refer-
ral rates to costs of care.

THE DECISION OF WHETHER
to refer a patient to an-
other physician is an im-
portant determinant of
health care quality and
spending.1-5 Patients who are referred to
specialists tend to incur greater health care
spending compared with those who re-
main within primary care, even after ad-
justing for health status.5 Although ap-
propriate specialist referrals improve
quality, overuse of referrals could in-
crease use of health care services without
benefit.4 Referrals and the associated coor-
dinationofcareforreferredpatientsarealso
important components of primary care.6
Despite the central role of referrals in
health care systems, relatively little re-
search has examined the epidemiologic
characteristics of physician referrals na-
tionally. The existing literature7-10 (com-
prehensively reviewed by Mehrotra et al10)
suggests that referral rates across physi-
cians vary substantially. Although clear
benchmarks are lacking, it is likely that
both overuse and underuse are preva-
lent.10 National trends of physician refer-
ral rates in the United States have not been
characterized since the late 1990s.11 Given
the importance of physician referrals and
changes in medical practice and knowl-
edge during the ensuing period, it is im-
portant to understand how referral pat-
terns have changed nationally since that
time. In addition, with the adoption of bud-
geted payment arrangements as envi-
sioned with accountable care organiza-
tions, referrals will likely become a more
important focus of both policymakers and
managers in their attempts to control
health care spending and maintain refer-
rals within organizations.
In this study, we examined ambulatory
physician referrals from 1993 to 2009 with
a focus on the 10-year period from 1999 to
2009,usingrepresentativedatafromtheNa-
tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey

Survey (NHAMCS).12,13 We also examined referral rates
for specific subgroups of patients and physicians, includ-
ing an analysis of referrals from primary care physicians
(PCPs) and specialists according to the category of pa-
tients' primary reason for the visit.
METHODS
DATA SOURCES
We used data from the NAMCS and the outpatient department
portionoftheNHAMCSfrom1993to2009.Weincludedallyears
that recorded referral to another physician from an ambulatory
visit and that contained survey design variables to account for
their multistage sampling design, which included 1999-2009 for
both surveys plus 1993-1994 for NAMCS and 1993-1996 for
NHAMCS. We focused on the period of continuous data from
1999 to 2009. Taken together, NAMCS and NHAMCS are rep-
resentative of outpatient physician visits nationally. Documen-
tation of survey methods are available at the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) Web site.14 The Harvard Medical School
Committee on Human Studies determined that this study was
exempt from review.
DATA COLLECTION PROCEDURES
Both NAMCS and NHAMCS use a multistage probability sample
design to obtain nationally representative samples of ambula-
tory patient visits in the United States.15,16 In the first stage of
sampling, 112 primary sampling units were selected among those
used in the National Health Interview Survey. For the second
stage, physician practices or hospitals were chosen within these
primary sampling units. Finally, physicians or clinics sampled
a subset of visits in their practices during a predefined period.
In NAMCS, individual physicians sampled a percentage of vis-
its during a 1-week period; in NHAMCS, outpatient clinics
sampled visits during a 4-week period.
This design enables calculation of national-level estimates
and associated standard errors using survey weights provided
by the NCHS. From 1993 to 2009, the physician response rate
for NAMCS ranged from 58.9% to 73.0%, and the clinic re-
sponse rate to NHAMCS ranged from 72.5% to 95.0%. The num-
ber of visits sampled annually ranged from 20 760 to 35 586
for a total of 845 243 between 1993 and 2009 (excluding 1995-
1998 for NAMCS and 1997-1998 for NHAMCS).
DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS
Data for each visit were collected using a standardized form com-
pleted during each visit. Variables included patient demo-
graphic information (age, sex, insurance type, and race), as well
as clinical details, such as the patient's reason for the visit, phy-
sician diagnosis, and visit disposition. The primary outcome
in this study was any visit disposition of a referral to another
physician. This measure was shown in one study12 to correlate
with independent observation of physician visits with high speci-
ficity and moderate sensitivity and thus most likely underes-
timates the number of referrals. We also defined a self-referral

as any visit to a provider that was marked as being not referred
(which is distinct from referral as the outcome of a visit) and
was also a new patient visit. Item-level nonresponse was gen-
erally less than 5% across all survey items.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
We analyzed referral rates by patient characteristics, physician
characteristics, and visit setting. Variables analyzed included age
(0-3, 3-18, 18-45, 45-65, and 65 years), sex, race (white,
black, and other by patient report), insurance (private, Medi-
care, Medicaid, and other/uninsured [included worker's com-
pensation,self-pay,charity,other,andunknowninsurance]),and
US region (Northeast, Midwest, South, and West). In 2005, the
surveyitemforpatientinsurancetypechangedfroma"markone"
form of payment to "mark all that apply," potentially affecting
any analysis of trends that rely on patient insurance type during
this period. In addition, in the NHAMCS data, the referral dis-
position survey item (our main outcome) changed from "re-
ferred to other physician/clinic" to "referred to other physician"
in 2001. Physician characteristics included whether physicians
practiced in a solo setting, owned their practice in part or in full,
made consults with patients by e-mail or telephone (first col-
lected in 2001), had any form of electronic medical record, and
received more than 50% of their income from managed care con-
tracts or Medicaid (first collected in 2003).
To analyze referral rates by physician specialty, we re-
stricted our analyses to survey data from NAMCS because phy-
sician specialty is not available in NHAMCS. We grouped spe-
cialties into 2 broad categories: primary care, which included
physicians in general and family practice, internal medicine,
and pediatrics without subspecialty, and specialist, which in-
cluded all other physicians (including obstetrics and gynecol-
ogy, which is grouped as primary care in NAMCS).
To explore the possibility that changes in referral rates were
disproportionately due to patients with particular diseases or
symptoms, we examined how often PCPs or specialists re-
ferred patients with particular symptoms in the first 4 years
(1999-2002) or final 4 years (2006-2009) of the continuous pe-
riod covered in our sample, using the first listed, or most im-
portant, reason for visit given by patients. We limited these analy-
ses to the 46.5% of visits for which the primary reason for visit
involved a symptom (eg, chest pain, but not general medical
examination or coronary atherosclerosis). Using the reason for
visit coding system developed by the NCHS,17 we categorized
all coded symptoms into 12 organ-based categories (details in
the eAppendix; http://www.archinternmed.com).
We calculated weighted numbers of visits, referral rates, and
their standard errors, taking account of the multistage probabil-
ity design as suggested by NCHS using the survey (version 3.22)
package in the programming language R (version 2.11).18,19 We
used US Census data provided in the NAMCS documentation
to calculate visits per 1000 persons. As NCHS recommends, we
did not include estimates with a relative standard error (defined
as the standard error divided by the estimate) of greater than or
equal to 30% or sample sizes of 30 or fewer visits, as these val-
ues are considered unreliable by NCHS standards.
We tested for trends across time using survey-weighted lo-
gistic regression by estimating the P value of the coefficient for
year as an explanatory variable for the outcome of physician
referral disposition across the relevant subgroup. Trend tests
were evaluated across the interval from 1999 to 2009. We evalu-
ated for the difference between trends for physician character-
istics using analysis of covariance, including an interaction term
with year. We evaluated the difference in referral rates by symp-
tom category across the 1999-2002 and 2006-2009 periods with
a survey-weighted 2 test. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, with
P.05 considered significant.
RESULTS
In the 10-year period from 1999 to 2009, the probabil-
ity that a physician visit resulted in a referral to another
physician (referral rate) increased from 4.8% to 9.3%
(P.001), a 94% increase (Table 1). In the same pe-
riod, the total number of ambulatory visits in the United
States increased from 841 million to 1130 million per year
or 3040 to 3720 visits per 1000 persons annually. Com-
bined with a national trend of increasing numbers of am-
bulatory visits, this led to a 159% increase in the na-
tional absolute number of visits resulting in a physician
referral, from 41 million in 1999 to 105 million in 2009.
Referral rates for Medicare patients more than doubled
(from 4.2% to 9.7%; P=.003) and, combined with the in-
crease in the number of visits annually, resulted in an
increase of more than 350% in the number of visits re-
sulting in a referral for Medicare beneficiaries.
The increase in referral rates was significant for both
office-based physicians and outpatient departmentÂ­
based physician practices. In office-based physician prac-
tices, physician referral rates increased 97% from 1999
to 2009 (from 4.4% to 8.6%; P=.004; Figure 1A). Re-
ferral rates in outpatient departmentÂ­based practices had
an 84% increase from 9.0% to 16.6% (P.001) despite

a baseline referral rate more than twice as high as that of
office-based physicians (Figure 1B). During this period,
patient self-referrals to physicians fell from 6.0% to 2.8%
of all visits, or a decrease from 51 million to 31 million
self-referred visits nationally from 1999 to 2009 (P.001
for trend). In Figure 1, referral rates from 1993-1994
(NAMCS) and 1993-1996 (NHAMCS) are included for
historical perspective.
Physicians with an ownership stake in their practice
had a significantly smaller increase in referral rates than
other physicians, growing only 79% (from 4.2% to
7.5%; P.001) compared with a 136% increase for
nonowner physicians (from 4.7% to 11.1%; P.001),
showing significantly different trends (P = .02,
Table 2). Physicians who reported that more than
50% of their income came from managed care contracts
also had lower growth in referral rates (P=.007 for
trend difference, Table 2).
Both specialists and PCPs saw large changes in their
referral rates from 1999 to 2009 (from 2.9% to 7.3% for
specialists and from 5.8% to 9.9% for PCPs; P.001 for
both; Figure 2). This corresponds to an absolute change
from 11 million to 38 million visits to specialists result-
ing in a referral vs 22 million to 51 million visits to PCPs
resulting in a referral. Despite these increases, the pro-
portion of all visits to specialists remained relatively stable,
increasing from 49.9% in 1999 to 50.5% in 2009.
For PCPs, changes in referral rates varied according to
theprincipalsymptomaccountingforapatient'svisit.Sig-
nificant increases occurred between the 1999-2002 and
2006-2009 intervals for visits with primary symptoms in
the cardiovascular (from 8.5% to 14.9%; P=.001), derma-

tion to an increase in 2 categories not shared with PCPs

COMMENT
In this study, we found a marked increase in referral rates
nationally from 1999 to 2009, with the absolute num-
ber of ambulatory visits resulting in a referral more than
doubling during this period. These trends are consis-
tent across primary care and specialist physicians as well
as office-based and outpatient departmentÂ­based physi-
cians. The increase in referral rates does not appear to
be predominantly driven by a particular patient demo-
graphic creating more demand for referrals. This evolu-
tion in care patterns may be playing a role in the rising
trajectory of health care spending in the United States
because referrals to specialists may lead to increased use
of higher-cost services.
One potentially contradictory finding is that, despite
the marked increase in the referral rate, the proportion of
all ambulatory visits to specialists has remained stable at
approximately 50%. This can be explained in a few ways:
first, because specialists refer to PCPs,20 referrals do not

decreased by about 19 million, which could explain up

to 30% of the total increase in referral rate; and last, the
numberofambulatoryvisitsper1000personsintheUnited
Statesincreasedmarkedlyinthe1999-2009interval.There-
fore, a possible consequence of increasing referral rates is
a greater number of ambulatory visits for the average per-
son, both in the primary care and specialist settings. An-
other contributing factor is that only about half of refer-
rals result in a completed appointment.21,22
There are several explanations for the increase in rates
of referrals. One possibility is that care is becoming in-
creasingly complex, thereby requiring ever more care by
specialized physicians.23,24 We find some evidence to sup-
port this hypothesis in Table 3, which shows that PCPs
became more likely to refer patients with certain chief
concerns but not others across the interval from 1999-
2002 to 2006-2009. For instance, we observed signifi-
cant changes for patients with cardiovascular or derma-
tologic symptoms but not in areas that are more
comfortably within the scope of primary care, such as gen-
eral/viral symptoms. Specialist physicians saw no signifi-
cant change in referral rates in these areas. Likewise, chief
concerns outside the traditional spectrum of primary care,
such as ocular or gynecologic/breast symptoms, had a con-
sistently high likelihood of referral from PCPs but had
no significant change in referral rate. This suggests that
some areas, such as cardiovascular and ear/nose/throat
symptoms, may be increasingly outside the expertise or
clinical portfolio of PCPs to manage alone. Other areas,
such as gastrointestinal and orthopedic symptoms, had
consistently increasing referral rates for PCPs and spe-
cialists, which may reflect increasing influence of those
specialties in health care markets.
A related hypothesis is that physicians are increas-
ingly faced with more to do during the typical visit de-
spite no meaningful change in appointment duration in
2 decades.25 Patients require more medications and more

frequently have 1 or more chronic medical conditions.26
Moreover, screening and preventive recommendations
have grown dramatically during this period. As a result,
although visit time has remained stable, physicians, and
in particular PCPs, may not have enough time to ad-
dress each patient issue, resulting in increased rates of
referrals. Finally, increasing numbers of specialists and
availability of specialist physicians may influence refer-
ral rates.27 This may help explain why hospital-based phy-
sicians in closer proximity to specialists in the hospital
setting have referral rates close to double those of office-
based physicians.
We also found that physicians who had an owner-
ship stake in their practice had lower increases in refer-
ral rates compared with their nonowner colleagues, which
might reflect a financial incentive for these physicians to
keep patients' care within their practice. Supporting the
potential influence of economic incentives on referral
rates, physicians with more than 50% of their income from
managed care contracts also had slower growth in refer-
ral rates. Another notable result is that patients in the 3-
to 18-year-old age group had a higher referral rate in 1999
compared with those older than 65 years, although this
difference disappeared by 2009. Patients older than 65
had a lower referral rate than did younger adults in 1999
and 2009, which may reflect that the former group had
generally already developed relationships with provid-
ers at an earlier age for their chronic illnesses.
It is unclear whether the trends that we observed re-
flect a change in the appropriateness of referrals. This is
the result, in part, of the fact that little guidance exists
on how to optimally define the appropriate use of refer-
rals. A recent review10 of the literature concluded that ap-
propriateness of referrals has yet to be studied effec-
tively. The complexity of referral appropriateness is
compounded by the multiple roles that specialists can play
in the care of a patient, ranging from consultative to pro-
cedural to comanaging a complex condition.6
This study is subject to several limitations. First, we
relied on the accuracy of reporting in the NAMCS and
NHAMCS instruments to measure referrals, which has
been shown in one study12 to have high specificity but
only moderate sensitivity. The survey question for this
field also changed in 2001 for NHAMCS, from "referred
to physician/clinic" to "referred to physician." We would
expect this wording change to narrow the potential range
of reasons to check this category and bias our findings
toward the null. Thus, the referral rates in this study are,
if anything, likely underestimating national rates. Sec-
ond, we had no information on why a referral was made
or to whom it was made. This is particularly relevant for
the results in Tables 3 and 4, where we relied on the as-
sumption of a relationship between a patient's primary
reason for visit and the reason for referral. We believe
that, on average, it is clinically reasonable to assume that
a referral has a high likelihood of relating to the primary
reason that brought a patient to visit the physician, but
this may not always be the case. Another limitation of
this study is that the response rate to NAMCS has fluc-
tuated, with a gradual decline between 1999 and 2009.
We believe that this is not likely to explain much of the
change seen, especially given that the response rate for
NHAMCS has been stable from 1999 to 2009. There is
also a possibility that our findings were affected by the
changing demographic characteristics of the popula-
tion. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey
from 1999 to 2008, however, show that the demo-
graphic composition by insurance status and income of
Americans reporting that they had 1 or more office vis-
its to a physician in the past year were stable (authors'
analysis, data from http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/). Fi-
nally, we relied on the accuracy of the sampling strategy
of NAMCS and NHAMCS to produce nationally repre-
sentative estimates.
In conclusion, we found that referrals in the United
States from PCPs to specialists grew rapidly from 1999
to 2009, with potential implications for health care spend-
ing. As federal and state policymakers consider policies
for reforming the health care system, developing meth-
ods to measure referral appropriateness and using these
to promote appropriate referrals may be an important
strategy for controlling growth in health care spending.
