Abstract
In women with lightly pigmented skin in particular, facial skin color homogeneity decreases with age, primarily due to chronic
exposure to solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR), leading to a decrease in perceived health and attractiveness. Perception of female
skin may be influenced by continuous exposure to, and thus familiarity with, age-related changes in visible skin condition in a given
society. Men and women of two traditional societies, the Maasai (Tanzania) and the Tsimane' (Bolivia), unfamiliar with lighter
colored skin, judged images of British women's facial skin for age, health, and attractiveness. In both samples, images with
homogeneous skin color (from the cheeks of younger women) were judged to be younger and healthier and received a stronger
preference than corresponding images with heterogeneous skin color (from older women). We suggest that (i) human sensitivity
for quality-related information from facial skin color distribution is universal and independent of any known age-dependent
variation in skin in a given population and (ii) skin discoloration is universally associated with less positive judgment.

Evidence suggests strongly that visible skin color distribution
(i.e., the homogeneity of the skin chromophores melanin and
hemoglobin), in addition to skin topography information and
facial shape characteristics, has an effect on perception of
facial age, health, and attractiveness. For example, visible
facial color distribution in shape- and topography-
standardized faces of females can account for up to 20 years
of apparent age (Fink, Grammer, & Matts, 2006), and homo-
geneous skin coloration selectively increases visual attention
toward female faces, resulting in more positive statements
about a woman's face (Fink et al., 2008). Moreover, age,
health, and attractiveness assessments of skin images, isolated
digitally the left cheeks of British women, correlate with an
objective, quantitative measure of homogeneity (Matts, Fink,
Grammer, & Burquest, 2007)--skin images with homogeneous
skin coloration are perceived to be younger, healthier, and
more attractive compared with their counterparts displaying
more heterogeneous skin color distribution.
Studies that have manipulated skin color distribution and
skin surface topography in female faces reported that both
males and females are remarkably sensitive to even small
changes in these features. Faces with skin surface topography
cues removed are judged significantly younger and more
attractive than their original (unmodified) counterparts (Samson,
Fink, Matts, Dawes, & Weitz, 2010). Observers can detect at

least a 20% visual change in skin surface topography. Similar
effects have been reported for the manipulation of skin color
distribution, showing that a smoothing of facial skin color dis-
tribution of approximately 25% has a significant effect on
health perception (Samson, Fink, & Matts, 2011).
This evidence of the impact of visible skin color distribution
on perception of age, health, and attractiveness has been
derived almost exclusively from investigations performed by
indigenous members of Western societies. A common concern
is that perception may be influenced by numerous (nonbiolo-
gical) factors, including a general familiarity with age-related
changes in skin condition, and ubiquitous images representing
a supposed "ideal" of youth, health, and beauty, created and
propagated by various sectors of industry and media. Because
this influence is virtually impossible to control for in an experi-
mental study, conclusions about possible hardwired mechan-
isms in deciphering age and health cues from visible skin
coloration, in addition to questions about the universality of
such a mechanism, remain speculative.
In this present study, we investigated perception of age,
health, and attractiveness of cropped skin images (obtained
from the cheeks of British women) in two nonindustrialized
societies, that is, the Maasai of Ngorongoro, Tanzania, and the
Tsimane' of lowland Bolivia. Should skin discoloration be a
universal concern, independent from familiarity with age-
related changes of that skin, we expected to observe similar
assessments to those reported in studies using indigenous mem-
bers of Western, industrialized society. That is, we expected
skin images obtained from younger women, showing less dis-
coloration than those of older women, to be judged as younger,
healthier, and more attractive than their older counterparts.
Material and Method
Participants
Participants comprised 90 individuals (49 men, 41 women) of the
Maasai, seminomadic pastoralists, of Endulen in the Ngorongoro
Conservation Area (Tanzania) and 82 individuals (42 men, 40
women) of the Tsimane', small-scale forager-horticulturalists,
in the area of Beni in northern Bolivia. Both societies have little
or no access to Western media (e.g., magazines or newspapers),
and electricity is unavailable. The study sites are not located near
tourist destinations. The age of Maasai participants ranged from
18 to 80 years (M ¼ 36.61, SD ¼ 16.58) and, in the Tsimane',
from 17 to 50 years (M ¼ 31.78, SD ¼ 11.73).
Ethical approval of the study protocol and consent proce-
dures was obtained from local ethical committees at Moscow
State University, protocol #55, 2015, the Tanzania Commis-
sion for Science and Technology, #2016-176-ER-2009-151,
the University of Wroclaw, and the Great Tsimane' Council.
Stimulus Material
Our stimuli were 18 color images, isolated digitally from
photographs of left profiles of female faces. These women were
photographed in the Reading area (United Kingdom) as part of
a larger scale project on perception of female skin (see Matts &
Fink, 2010, for review). The entire sample comprised 170
British women and girls from the ages of 11 to 76 years
(M ¼ 37.39, SD ¼ 17.35). Photographs were collected using
a custom digital imaging rig comprising a 6.2-megapixel digi-
tal single-lens reflex camera fitted with a 45 mm f/2.8 P lens
(Nikon Corp, Tokyo, Japan), a fully cross-polarized multiple
flash lighting system, and a chin rest to ensure accurate, repro-
ducible positioning of individuals and overall component sta-
bility. This setup effectively eliminated visible high-frequency/
low-amplitude skin surface topography (microtexture). Images
were captured and stored in uncompressed format at a resolu-
tion of 3,277 Â 2,226 pixels. No color correction or spatial
filtering was applied to these images.
The cropped skin image samples from the left hemifaces had
a size of 500 Â 500 pixels and were taken from the same region
of each face (Figure 1). The cheek area sampled was chosen as
it was generally devoid of high-amplitude, low-frequency fea-
tures (e.g., lines, wrinkles, furrows) that would have otherwise
contributed significantly to visible contrast. Although the
extraction of image samples was done automatically, some had
to be adjusted slightly (i.e., moved to the left or right along the
x-axis) when the selected region was partly covered by hair or
included facial topography cues. Information on an objective
measure of skin image homogeneity (Haralick's homogeneity
measure; Haralick, 1979) was available from analysis per-
formed in a previous study (Matts et al., 2007).
Of the entire set of skin images, one to two images of each
5-year age cohort (using information on chronological age
provided by female participants) were selected randomly (by
computer) for inclusion in the stimulus set for the present study.
Thus, we obtained a set of 18 images that were then printed on
A6-sized glossy paper at a resolution of 133 dpi. The printouts
were laminated and labeled (on the rear of each) with the
female participants' three-digit ID. This set was produced in
duplicate, one set for presentation with the Tsimane' (Bolivia)
and another for presentation with the Maasai (Tanzania).

(image "b").

Procedure
In both societies, each participant viewed all 18 cards, one after
the other, and was asked to assess them (in blocks) for age,
health, and attractiveness. The order of blocks was randomized
across participants, as was the order of images within each
block (i.e., the investigator shuffled the cards before the start
of each block). Participants were requested to estimate the age
of the person the skin image corresponded to, judge the skin
image for health, and provide a statement with regard to attrac-
tiveness. Participants received verbal instructions and their
responses were recorded on paper by the investigators. They
were allowed to look at the images for their decision as long as
they wished. Responses were recorded as follows: Maasai: age,
0 ¼ old, 1 ¼ young; health, 0 ¼ unhealthy, 1 ¼ healthy;
attractiveness, 0 ¼ dislike, 1 ¼ like; Tsimane': age, 0 ¼ old,
1 ¼ adult, 2 ¼ young, 3 ¼ baby; health, 1 ¼ ill, 2 ¼ average, 3
¼ healthy; attractiveness, 1 ¼ unattractive, 2 ¼ average, 3 ¼
attractive. Thus, in both samples, higher scores indicate that the
respective skin image was perceived as younger, healthier, and
more attractive by the participants compared with those receiv-
ing lower scores.
Results
For the analysis, the images were categorized into two sets
("young skin" vs. "old skin"), based on the chronological age
of the person whom the image was taken from. The age range
for young skin was 12­42 years (M ¼ 27.22, SD ¼ 11.85) and
for old skin was 44­77 years (M ¼ 57.67, SD ¼ 9.14). Objec-
tive analysis of skin image homogeneity revealed a significant
difference between the two sets, with young skin being more
homogeneous than old skin (young: M ¼ 897.44, SD ¼ 46.47;
old: M ¼ 806.89, SD ¼ 56.87; t ¼ 3.39, p < .01)
Descriptive statistics of perceived age, health, and attrac-
tiveness scores of young skin and old skin images in the Maasai
and Tsimane' are reported in Table 1. To test for differences in
age, health, and attractiveness, perceptions of young skin ver-
sus old skin and a possible effect of participants gender on
perceptions, mixed-model analyses of variance were performed
with skin age-group as within-subject factor and gender as
between-subjects factor, separately for the Maasai and the Tsi-
mane'. In the Maasai, there was a significant main effect of
skin age-group on perception of age, F(1, 88) ¼ 13.97, p <
.001, Z2

¼ :14; health, F(1, 88) ¼ 33.96, p < .001, Z2

¼ :28;
and attractiveness, F(1, 88) ¼ 16.77, p < .001, Z2

¼ :16, and an

.001, Z2
p
¼ :12, but not age, F(1, 88) ¼ 2.44, p ¼ .12, Z2
p
¼ :03,
and attractiveness, F(1, 88) ¼ 1.34, p ¼ .25, Z2
p
¼ :02. Skin
age-group and gender had a significant interaction effect on age
and health assessment, age: F(1, 88) ¼ 8.14, p < .01, Z2
p
¼ :09,
health: F(1, 88) ¼ 13.90, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ :14, but not on attrac-
tiveness: F(1, 88) ¼ 2.73, p ¼ .10, Z2
p
¼ :03. Thus, skin images
obtained from young women were perceived as younger and
received higher health and attractiveness ratings compared
with those obtained from older women. Men provided more
positive ratings than women, and this discrepancy in assess-
ments was particularly evident for age and health assessments
of young skin (Tukey's test, young skin vs. old skin: men, p <
.001, women, p ¼ .93).
In the Tsimane', there was a significant main effect of skin
age-group on perception of age, F(1, 80) ¼ 86.87, p < .001,
Z2
p
¼ :52; health, F(1, 80) ¼ 22.52, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ :22; and
attractiveness, F(1, 80) ¼ 26.15, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ :25, and an
effect of gender on perception of age, F(1, 80) ¼ 6.39, p < .05,
Z2
p
¼ :07, but not health, F(1, 80) ¼ 2.13, p ¼ .15, Z2
p
¼ :03,
and attractiveness, F(1, 80) ¼ 0.04, p ¼ .95, Z2
p
¼ :00005. No
significant interaction effects of skin age and gender were
detected, all F(1, 80) < 2.05, all p > .16, all Z2
p
¼ :03. Thus,
men and women judged skin images of younger women as
younger, healthier, and more attractive. Women's age judg-
ments were higher than men's assessments, although, unlike
the Maasai, no significant interaction effects of skin age-group
and gender could be detected for the three attributes.
Discussion
Previous studies in Western samples showed that female skin
coloration has a significant effect on visual perception of age,
health, and attractiveness, both within whole faces and cropped
skin images, and that this effect is independent of face shape and
skin surface topography information (Fink, Matts, & Grammer,
2006). Moreover, the objective assessment of female skin col-
oration has revealed that the evenness of melanin and hemoglo-
bin concentrations in skin correlates significantly and positively
with assessments of youth, health, and attractiveness (Matts
et al., 2007). The present study shows that these visual assess-
ments of skin quality are not limited to Western observers but
extend even to societies unfamiliar with lighter colored skin.
To date, it has been unclear if and to what extent perception
of age, health, and attractiveness of facial skin might be driven
by the observer's familiarity with age- and health-related
change within their own skin type. Since we are exposed con-
stantly to significant individual variation within our own skin
type, it is, therefore, possible that responses to age-/health-

related cues of skin discoloration are learned and do not reflect
an adaptation. Indeed, the majority of studies on skin-derived
cues of quality have been conducted in Western, educated,
industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies (Hen-
rich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010) and extrapolated to universal
human behavior.
Our directly observed data suggest strongly that perception
of skin color evenness transcends WEIRD societies. Given the
similarities of age, health, and attractiveness perception in the
Maasai and Tsimane' with that previously reported from indus-
trialized societies, and the lack of evidence for cross-cultural
transmission effects on quality assessments of lightly pigmen-
ted skin in these societies, we conclude that human sensitivity
to variation in facial skin color distribution is a universal fea-
ture. The ability to perceive age- and health-related variation in
facial skin contrast may have evolved to identify features that
are particularly relevant in the assessment of female quality in
the selection of mating partners. We do not propose that
humans have been adapted to skin evenness per se but suggest
that sensitivity to derive age- and health-related information
from facial skin color distribution may have developed in con-
sequence of selection pressures to identify young and healthy
partners, and this sensitivity may be universal.
One may speculate that such selection pressure has acted
more strongly on men than on women (which may explain
higher male assessments of young skin in the Maasai). How-
ever, it is known from investigation of Western samples that
facial skin color distribution plays a role in both men and
women, in terms of age, health, and attractiveness perceptions
(Fink et al., 2006, 2012; Matts et al., 2007). Whether women of
preindustrialized societies are sensitive to variation in male
facial skin color distribution needs to be tested. We consider
this plausible, given the skin images we used in the present
study were independent of facial context. Likewise, future
studies should also investigate whether indigenous members
of Western societies can discern age- and health-related skin
quality cues of members of preindustrialized societies such as
the Maasai and the Tsimane'. We consider this likely, as the
human eye is highly sensitive to visual contrast and as age,
health, and attractiveness assessments of facial skin are prob-
ably based on detecting contrast cues. However, we also expect
own population skin characteristics to be more nuanced than
that of other populations.
In conclusion, we suggest that human sensitivity for quality-
related information from facial skin color distribution may be
universal and independent of any known age-dependent varia-
tion in skin in a given population, as age, health, and attrac-
tiveness assessments of facial skin are driven by the assessment
of skin contrast. Cross-cultural comparison of visual skin color
distribution perception in relation to skin type (lighter vs. dar-
ker pigmentation), however, may reveal variation in people's
sensitivity to skin contrast cues and related assessments of skin
quality.
