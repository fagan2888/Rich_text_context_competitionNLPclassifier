commodification of geographic
information: An examination

Abstract
The body of information on the Internet is becoming increasingly geographical. This is both due to the expansion of
established categories of geographic information (e.g., digital maps and geospatial databases) and to the simultaneous
enrichment of other types of information through geographic identifiers (e.g., geotags, check-ins, and global positioning
system coordinates). As this repository of geographic information expands, it is also a key site for multiple processes of
commodification transforming informational resources into market goods. Understanding the dynamics driving the
integration of geographic information into the digital economy requires a comprehensive political economic analysis.
A key component of this analysis is to explain the logics of creation and allocation of economic value from geographic
information on the Internet. Addressing this need, in the present article I deploy the property regimes schema developed
by Schlager and Ostrom and expand it to elucidate the differentiated commodification processes of geographic informa-
tion on the Internet. Property regimes are arrangements that define rules, distribute rights, and delineate roles with
respect to particular goods. These arrangements are enabled by elements such as legal frameworks, jurisdictions, type of
information, and technologies of access. In this article, I explore how the legal frameworks regulating traditional
categories of geographic information (such as maps) have been destabilized in the process of technological innovation,
leading to the creation of new informational goods along with their respective property regimes, and rearticulating legal,
economic, and sociotechnical relations. To illustrate this, I analyze the case of Google Street View images through their
property regimes in various jurisdictions.

Introduction
The overarching goal of this article is to analyze and
explain the commodification of geographic information
on the Internet by examining the property regimes that
emerge in this process. Property regimes are ways of
organizing diverse bundles of rights with respect to a
specific resource. These rights are the product of rules,
which define how they can be allocated to particular
actors, which in turn creates roles with specific func-
tions within the property regime.
A well-defined conceptual schema of property
regimes can help sharpen the analysis and management
of resources and their economic exploitation. In this
article, I mobilize the schema developed by Schlager
and Ostrom (1992) and extend it to analyze the com-
modification of digital geographic information on the
Internet. The goal is to produce a more finely grained
understanding of how geographic information is inte-
grated into the digital economy. This analysis begins by

exploring how the digitization of geographic informa-
tion has destabilized and reconfigured property regimes
from established informational categories such as maps
and databases.
Through the lens of property regimes, I explore the
interactions and configurations between actors, tech-
nologies, and institutional frameworks that both
enable and result from the creation of market
goods through digitized geographic information.
Furthermore, by showing the diverse dynamics of com-
modification, this article contributes to the necessary
task of building a richer political economy of geo-
graphic information on the Internet (Elwood and
Leszczynski, 2012; Leszczynski, 2012) that ``goes
beyond the geotag,'' or transcends the locative aspects
of geographic information and analyzes its contextual
elements in greater depth (Crampton et al., 2013).
By organizing the allocation of rights over resources,
property regimes also articulate social relations among
actors. This process is mediated by technologies tai-
lored to specific types of resources and individual
goods. Such technologies are used to grant access to
and monitor the use of the resource, as well as
to define, allocate, and regulate the rights specific to
each particular role. Technology thus plays a key role
in the allocation of rights to a resource and therefore its
management, exploitation, and commodification. For
example, a fishery will require management technolo-
gies quite different from digital systems controlling
access to copyrighted digital content. New kinds of
property rights management technologies have prolif-
erated in digital information environments. Some
examples of these include anti-piracy digital rights man-
agement software (DRM), password protection, region
encoding, and subscription charges, among many
others. Following the widespread imperative to extract
profit from information, the digital economy is increas-
ingly characterized by the use of rights management
technologies in the context of monetary exchanges.
However, in digital environments, the technologies
used to access, manage, and commercialize information
often go unnoticed or appear `natural' to many users.
In his discussion of the `disburdenment' of human intel-
ligence from the context of experience, Borgmann
(2000) cautions that the increasing complexity of med-
iating technologies often obscures the nature of the
social relations they articulate. Building on this insight,
the property regimes analysis advanced in this article
contributes to a political economy of digital informa-
tion that tackles the power dynamics, socioeconomic
relations, and technological configurations behind an
economy of digital information--which, despite its
physical expressions (Blanchette, 2011) and infrastruc-
tural requirements (Blum, 2012), is often abstracted
into an immaterial ``cloud'' (Mosco, 2014) and
characterized as ``bits'' rather than ``atoms''
(Negroponte, 1995).
A crucial instance of this mediation is the techno-
logical composition of information, or how specific
technologies and formats shape its structural features.
Since technology and information are inseparable from
the rest of the social world, the technological compos-
ition of information is influenced by socioeconomic
relations (Pinch and Bijker, 1984) and simultaneously
impacts them (Winner, 1993). This mutually constitu-
tive relationship has important implications for the
construction of property regimes of digital geographic
information. An illustrative case in point is the contrast
between digital and print information technologies. In
the last four decades, increased digitization has entailed
a sweeping disruption of long-established information
practices and categories. The emergence of new media
to store and display information has transformed sig-
nificantly how goods are categorized in law and prac-
tice, affecting the rules regulating their economic
exploitation. These reconfigurations of rules, technolo-
gies, and practices have created new property regimes
for the management and economic exploitation of
informational goods.
The growing repository of geographic information
on the Internet (often referred to as the `geoweb') is
the result of cumulative technological innovations
such as social media, the exponential increase in pro-
cessing speed, widespread cloud storage, and the emer-
gence of server-side web-mapping (Tagoe and Mantey,
2011). These technological developments, along with
the economic imperatives to commercialize geographic
information, the regulatory frameworks of particular
informational categories, and territorial jurisdictions
at different scales jointly articulate the property regimes
of geographic information. Analyzing how these
property regimes come together is an important step
towards understanding the commodification affecting
digital geographic information, as well as the broader
political economy in which it develops.
In the following section, I introduce and explain
Schlager and Ostrom's (1992: 249) conceptual schema
of property regimes in the contexts of theories of prop-
erty and the problem of distributed rights in digital
environments. I then propose an extension of this
schema tailored to the analysis of digital geographic
information. Afterwards, I show how new property
regimes are created through the technological trans-
formations of established informational goods, such
as in the process of digitization. To illustrate this,
I use the example of maps, a paradigmatic good
in the category of geographic information. By exploring
the transition from printed to digital formats, I show
the emergence of new property regimes and how this
destabilizes existing categories, creates new ones, and in
2 Big Data & Society
the process rearticulates processes of commodification.
I then deploy the property regimes schema to analyze
the commodification of geographic information in the
case of a good that is a result of the integration of
different types of geographic (and non-geographic)
information in a networked digital environment:
Google Street View. The analysis shows the various
types of rights attached to each component of this
good, the allocation of these rights, and the manage-
ment technologies that mediate this process. One
important implication is that the integration of different
kinds of information and the emergence of new prop-
erty regimes in the process of commodification often
creates tension between sets of values and logics,
which often transcend property rights understood in
isolation. A key example of this is privacy rights. As I
show in the case of Google Street View, information
that points to location and context must inevitably con-
sider the aspects of privacy that arise from its collection
and distribution. I conclude the analysis of the com-
modification of Google Street View by exploring how
shifting notions and new constructions of privacy are
deeply constitutive of the creation of new geographic
information products and the property regimes that
come together in this process.
Property regimes and the
commodification of
geographic information
The expansion of geographic information on the
Internet should be understood in the context of a
wider political economy characterized by the increasing
reliance of capitalism on immaterial, symbolic,
cognitive-cultural, and informational goods (Lash and
Urry, 1994; Schiller, 2000; Scott, 2007), as well as by the
dramatic growth of the digital economy (Ng, 2014;
Sobel, 2003; Vafopoulos, 2011; World Economic
Forum and Boston Consulting Group, 2013). This het-
erogeneous body of informational products includes
commercial databases as well as resources whose pri-
mary purpose is not necessarily commercial, such as
public information repositories, like the US Census
Bureau's American Fact Finder, and collaborative pro-
jects like OpenStreetMap. The capabilities of geo-
graphic information to provide location and context
have fueled its growing demand in a wide range of
activities, from retail and advertising to political cam-
paigning (Henttu et al., 2012; World Economic Forum
and Boston Consulting Group, 2013). In this expanding
economy of geographic information, the lines between
commercial and non-commercial products are continu-
ously redrawn, and their property regimes reconfigured.
Commodification, or the process of creating goods
for the market, implies the delineation of property
rights suitable for economic exchange. However, prop-
erty rights must function within a broader infrastruc-
ture that includes legal, political, and technological
arrangements. Radin has called this ``the legal infra-
structure of private-property-plus free contract''
(Radin, 2002). This draws attention to the mutual con-
stitution of property rights with social and institutional
relations that emerge from and regulate the use, own-
ership, and exchange of any particular good.
Digital information has posed particular challenges
for the definition of property rights. Samuelson identi-
fied six characteristics of digital media that challenge
and disrupt existing intellectual property systems:
(1) ease of reproduction, (2) ease of transmission,
(3) ease of modification and manipulation, (4) equiva-
lence of digital works, (5) compactness of digital works,
and (6) new methods of searching and linking digital
works (Samuelson, 1990). These challenges to existing
notions of property rights become even more acute in
networked information environments. Overcoming
them is a key requirement for the digital economy,
which increasingly relies on the monetized exchanges
over the Internet. This has led to new approaches in
the allocation of distributed property rights. Often
these take the form of technical solutions such as the
information controls and DRM systems mentioned
above. These systems have prompted discussions
(Becker et al., 2003) regarding their role in privatizing
copyright (Lessig, 1999), narrowing property rights
(Cohen, 1998), overreaching intellectual property
enforcement (Samuelson, 1999), and even their futility
in the face of alternative distribution networks ­ such as
peer-to-peer sharing (Biddle et al., 2003).
In challenging and redefining the property rights
enforcement, digital technologies have produced new
configurations of social relations, institutions, and tech-
nologies that come together in various ways for the
commodification of particular informational goods.
This requires analyses able to integrate the allocation
of rights with the commodification of digital informa-
tional goods into the multiple dimensions at which
these take place: infrastructural (e.g., cables, server
farms, terminals), geographical (e.g., territorial jurisdic-
tions, borders), informational (e.g. information man-
agement technologies and governance regimes of
specific informational categories).
These and other technological challenges have been
reinforced by theoretical shifts away from absolutist
and individualistic conceptions of property and
towards more contextually dependent readings.
Perhaps the most influential, cited, and critiqued defin-
ition of property has been Blackstone's definition of
private property, from Commentary on the Laws of
England: ``that sole and despotic dominion which one
man claims and exercises over the external things of the
Leo
´n 3
world, in total exclusion of the right of any other indi-
vidual in the universe'' (Blackstone, 1893: 304). While
Blackstone's analysis of property rights was more
nuanced than his definition would suggest (Schorr,
2009), the underlying idea of a ``sole and despotic
dominion'' ``rings through the ages, and continues to
block clear thinking about private property'' (Heller,
2000: 418). This idea of private property has been com-
plemented by two additional categories to settle into
what Michael Heller calls the ``well-worn trilogy of
ownership forms ­private, commons, and state prop-
erty'' (Heller, 2000: 418). The first category refers to
property owned by particular individuals (or families
or firms); the second, by no one in particular; and the
third, by the state (Heller, 2000: 418). Yet while this
classification broadens the idea of property to associate
it with different actors, it does not reflect the diversity
of arrangements that exist in practice.
An alternate conception of property, which chal-
lenges absolutist and individualistic notions, is that of
a ``bundle of various rights, liberties, and powers that
can be divided among many parties in numerous ways''
(Gaus, 2012: 94). Taking this conception as a point
of departure, (Elinor and Vincent) Ostrom, along
with other scholars of the Bloomington School of
Political Economy, developed a systematic approach
to the distribution of property rights, the analysis of
their different configurations in practice and their the-
oretical synthesis. A particularly useful and versatile
tool among these contributions is the conceptual
schema proposed by Schlager and Ostrom ``for array-
ing property-rights regimes that distinguishes among
diverse bundles of rights ranging from authorized
user, to claimant, to proprietor, and to owner''
(Schlager and Ostrom, 1992: 249).
This schema enables an organized analysis of how
bundles of rights are distributed in the management of
a resource system. In this context, ``rights'' refers to
``particular actions that are authorized,'' which are allo-
cated to different ``roles.'' ``Rights'' are the product of
``rules,'' or the prescriptions that create certain author-
izations (Schlager and Ostrom, 1992: 250). Rules refer
to three different levels of action: operational, collective-
choice, and constitutional. Schlager and Ostrom explain
the distinction between the first two categories as ``the
difference between exercising a right [operational] and
participating in the definition of future rights to be
exercised [collective-choice]'' (Schlager and Ostrom,
1992: 251). The third level of action (constitutional) is
where collective-choice rules are defined. The schema
proposed by Schlager and Ostrom focuses on the
organization of the first two levels of action in a prop-
erty regime: the rules that create certain rights, and the
roles defined by the allocation of those rights to par-
ticular actors. These elements, which together consti-
tute any given property regime, are represented in
Table 1.
The property regimes schema illustrated by Table 1
is comprised by two levels of action (operational and
collective-choice), five rights (access, withdrawal, man-
agement, exclusion and alienation), and four roles
(authorized user, claimant, proprietor, and owner)
(Schlager and Ostrom, 1992: 249). The incremental
allocation of rights to different roles shows how prop-
erty rights can be disaggregated and distributed in a
variety of ways. In this arrangement, the authorized
user has the least rights (access and withdrawal) and
the owner has the most (full set of property rights,
including alienation). While the owner's full set of
property rights echoes the Blackstonian definition
property discussed above, a key insight from Schlager
and Ostrom is that owners are not the only users who
``make long-term investments in the development of
resource systems'' (Schlager and Ostrom, 1992: 249).

This is consistent with the more general insight that
there is no ``one size fits all'' model of property regimes
which consistently produces ``better'' outcomes, but
rather a multiplicity of ways to manage the rights
over resources without over-exploiting them (Ostrom,
1990, 2010). This has been the basis for theoretical
developments on property and resource management
encapsulated by ``Ostrom's Law'': ``a resource arrange-
ment that works in practice can work in theory''
(Fennell, 2011: 9). One of these developments has
been to explore the construction of knowledge as com-
mons (Hess and Ostrom, 2007). Seeking to complement
this body of work, the present article analyzes a move-
ment in the opposite direction of knowledge commons:
the commodification of digital geographic information
on the Internet.
Coexisting in a networked environment, repositories
of government-produced, privately collected, and vol-
unteered geographic information (among other types)
are increasingly recombined to produce new market
and non-market goods. Each of these informational
inputs is often governed by different regulatory
frameworks, which are articulated in the development
of new property regimes. For example, as is discussed
later in the article: the privacy rights related to the
collection images and wireless data during the
creation of Google Street View have brought this prod-
uct under a regulatory framework not applied previ-
ously to traditional maps. This highlights why the
political economy of geographic information requires
a detailed and contextualized understanding of the
new property regimes that emerge in the process of
commodification.
Specifically in the case of geographic information,
Cho advances a notion compatible with ``bundles of
rights'': layers of property rights over geographic infor-
mation, which have a technical basis on the model of
superimposed datasets used by most Geographic
Information Systems (Cho, 2005: 135). While ``bundles
of rights'' can be thought of as a ``vertical'' allocation
of partial rights over an entire good, ``layers of rights''
in geographic information suggests a ``horizontal'' div-
ision. The coexistence of these in electronic maps and
other geographic informational goods shapes negoti-
ations in the rights attached to discrete sets of informa-
tion superimposed on each other, but which may each
have diverse origins and property regimes. This is a
feature that makes digital cartographic products sub-
stantially different from print maps, which only showed
the graphic output of a specific arrangement of infor-
mation, while concealing the layers of input required in
their production. When digital maps and other types of
geographic information are uploaded to the Internet,
these complexities are intensified because they become
part of an informational environment with great
potential for widespread distribution, accessibility,
and recombination.
Considering digitized geographic information, this
article extends Schlager and Ostrom's property regimes
conceptual schema by focusing on three key elements to
analyze commodification of geographic information:
(1) the role of information technologies (such as the
technological composition of particular informational
goods, and technologies of access and management,
­ e.g., application programming interfaces, or APIs),
(2) the specific features of digitized geographic informa-
tion, such as the six features of digital media identified
by Samuelson above, and the information layers char-
acteristic of geographic information, and (3) the inter-
section and conflict between different logics and values
resulting from the combination of informational inputs
in the production of digital goods ­ such as issues
with property and privacy rights discussed in the case
of Google Street View. Together these elements shape
the commodification of digital geographic information
goods, by modulating the allocation of rights over them
and articulating new property regimes.
The property regimes of geographic information and
its commodification take shape within a broader polit-
ical economy affected by the changing role of the state
in the collection and provision of geographic goods. On
the one hand, many national and subnational adminis-
trations are adopting ``open data policies'' (Huijboom
and Van den Broek, 2011). On the other hand, there is a
``roll back'' by different governments away from previ-
ously publicly provided functions and services, which
impacts the production of geographic information
(Leszczynski, 2012). This retreat has produced at least
two concurrent developments. Firstly, it has transferred
mapping capabilities to private corporations and com-
munities of users. This transfer has occurred explicitly
through outsourcing and subcontracting, or implicitly
through passive non-competition and the creation of
market spaces for the development of a geographic
information industry. In the past decade, this process
has been accelerated by the availability of web-based
mapping technologies. Secondly, this process has reori-
ented state capacity towards intensifying the publicly
funded collection and production of restricted-access
geographic information, much of it towards the swel-
ling surveillance and security apparatus of various
states (Crampton, 2014; Crampton et al., 2014;
Howard et al., 2011).
Digital geographic information incorporates key fea-
tures in contemporary capitalism such as digitization,
intellectual property, regulatory restructuring, and the
digital economy. This makes understanding its com-
modification a necessary task. In the following section,
I begin this task by showing how property regimes are
reconfigured through the digitization of information
Leo
´n 5
and focus on the transition from print to digital maps.
This lays the groundwork for analyzing the commodi-
fication of a particular digital geographic information
good: Google Street View.
From maps to databases
To illustrate the interdependence between technological
change and property regimes in the context of geo-
graphic information, consider an example that predates
­ and prefigures ­ developments in the ``geoweb'': the
transition from paper to electronic maps. Since
the appearance of Geographic Information Systems in
the 1960s, the focus on hand-drawn paper maps as
products of the cartographic process has shifted
towards the dynamic manipulation of different kinds
of geographic information through innovations in
computing and geographic information technologies
(Cartwright and Peterson, 2007; PF Fisher, 1998).
These changes in cartography, geographic information
management, and their widening range of applications
have fueled an industry with an estimated $USD
75 billion in global revenue in 2012 (Oxera, 2013) and
a multiplier effect of $USD 1.6 trillion in U.S. economic
growth (Henttu et al., 2012). The digitization of maps
and computerization of the cartographic process have
also redefined geographic information. This epistemic
shift is at the crucible of significant legal changes, such
as the emergence of new property regimes involved in
the management and commodification of geographic
information.
In the United States, maps have been a protected
category under Copyright Law since the first
Copyright Act (Copyright Act of 1790, 1790).
However, the term ``map'' is no longer a stable cat-
egory. For the first two centuries of US Copyright
Law, while there were intermittent arguments regard-
ing what constitutes originality in a map ­a require-
ment for copyright protection ­ (Whicher, 1963) ­
these were not focused on the question of what a map
is. Maps were tacitly understood in the legal context as
pictorial representations of spatial information. The
increased production of maps by digital geographic
information systems has destabilized the legal consen-
sus governing the definition of these objects and the
protections granted to them.
Copyright Law considers maps the pictorial outputs
of the cartographic process. However, maps are
increasingly defined not by their pictorial aspects, but
by the informational inputs and operations involved in
their production. This technological shift has recali-
brated the economic valuation of maps. Geographic
Information Systems enable the organization, analysis,
and transformation of spatial data while making
the creation of graphical maps a secondary task.
Consequently, the value attributed to the mapping pro-
cess has shifted to the increasingly complex databases
of spatial information and the techniques used to
extract meaningful patterns from them. With the
expansion of ``big data'' (Kitchin, 2014a, 2014b;
Mayer-Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier, 2013), the database
components of maps have found ever wider applica-
tions (e.g., real-time enhanced navigation such as
Waze, and geo-targeted advertising) and market poten-
tial relative to the graphical component of maps.
Notwithstanding the growing economic value of
databases, contrasting degrees of protection are offered
to the pictorial and informational components of digi-
tal maps. Whereas pictorial maps are still protected by
Copyright Law, databases are subject to a more con-
tested legal regime (Reichman and Samuelson, 1997).
The US Supreme Court decision on the case of
Feist v Rural in 1991 established that databases are
not de facto protected by copyright because they are
considered compilations of facts. This ruling disquali-
fied databases from automatic protection for two main
reasons: Firstly, facts themselves cannot be copy-
righted. Secondly, compilations do not necessarily
meet the minimum threshold of creativity required to
be considered original expressions (Feist Publications,
Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 1991).
The Feist verdict was reached by concluding that
Feist Publications' copy of over 1000 entries from a
telephone directory published by Rural Telephone
Service did not imply a copyright violation. While the
origins of this ruling may seem rooted in a different era,
its resonance for the digital economy has become sig-
nificant due to its impact on the protection of databases
compiled in any medium. In the context of geographic
information, this implies a discrepancy in the property
regimes of the different informational components of
the map that has not been fully resolved and is expected
to continue generating debates in the courts.
Furthermore, this decision has generated new ways
of managing the value of maps and allocating rights to
their use and commercialization. However, since the
underlying databases are not de facto protected by
copyright, this opens the door for increased use of con-
tracts (Karjala, 1995) or hybrid sui generis protections,
both of which may be much more restrictive than the
most stringent copyright protections and have signifi-
cant anti-competitive effects while constraining access
to essential inputs for knowledge creation (Reichman
and Samuelson, 1997).
These developments show that the transition from
printed to electronic maps affected much more than
the technical aspects of geographic products: it also
transformed their meaning, value, and regulation. In
the following section I deploy the property regimes
schema to analyze the commodification of Google
6 Big Data & Society
Street View, a new type of geographic information pro-
duct in the context generated by the technological and
regulatory rearticulations discussed above.
Constructing Google Street View's
property regime
The commodification of Google Street
View images
Released in 2007, the Google Street View platform was
not the first service to show a map with linked photo-
graphs for specific locations: Amazon launched the
short-lived BlockView in 2005 and Microsoft's
Streetside appeared in 2006. Yet Google Street View
soon developed competitive advantages through exten-
sive primary data collection by Google vehicles and
integration with Google Maps and Search platforms.
This allowed Google Street View to produce a compre-
hensive and navigable virtual environment. Initially
launched in five cities (San Francisco, New York, Las
Vegas, Miami and Denver), it now covers 3000 cities in
54 countries and is expanding to cover features such as
the Amazon and the Grand Canyon (Fisher, 2013).
The development of Google Street View also
entailed the production of new cartographic perspec-
tives. These perspectives signaled not only new
ground in cartographic representation, but also shift
in image processing and delivery technologies, as well
as new modes of user engagement with digital maps. An
element of this is the innovation of the R5 and R7
rosette cameras, which are mounted on Google vehi-
cles, and can produce a continuous 360-degree panora-
mic high-resolution digital environment (Anguelov
et al., 2010). As mentioned above, another element is
the integration of this virtual environment into Google
Maps and Search (Vincent, 2007). This enables users to
navigate space by transitioning between the carto-
graphic ``view from above'' provided by Google
Maps, with its turn-by-turn navigation interface
(which directs drivers at each step of their route), and
the virtual landscape of Google Street View with its
reproduction of the street-level point of view, of the
car or pedestrian (Anguelov et al., 2010). These features
are further enhanced by the inclusion of satellite layers
on the Google Maps and with the separate release of
the Google Earth application.
Beyond contributing to Google Maps' hegemony of
general-purpose web-mapping service and mobile navi-
gation applications (Smith, 2013), the significance of
Google Street View lies in blurring the lines between
digital maps, navigation services, and virtual environ-
ments. This results from expanding the scale (millions
of images), scope (growing coverage), perspective
(ground level linked to view from above), and usability
(navigation function and articulation with search) of
digital maps on the Internet. By integrating these elem-
ents into a consumer product which users can access
through tiered service (involving both informational
and monetary exchanges), Google has engaged in per-
haps the most thorough and expansive commodifica-
tion of geographic information ever attempted.
Since the tiers of service provision correspond to sets
of rights transferred to users in various types of
exchanges, a property regimes analysis through an
extension of Schlager and Ostrom's (1992) schema
can help illuminate how Google Street View and
Google Maps commodify geographic information.
A first step in the commodification of geographic
information is securing the property rights for the digi-
tal images in Google Street View for their assembly into
a virtual environment. This constitutes a process of
landscape production. According to Cosgrove, since
its inception in Renaissance Europe, landscape as a
``way of seeing'' has achieved ``the control and domin-
ation over space as an absolute, objective entity, its
transformation into the property of individual or
state'' (Cosgrove, 1985: 46). Landscape production
was bound up with activities of power, control, and
strategic domination of space such as survey and
mapping of estates by the urban bourgeoisie, defensive
fortification, and cartographic projection (Cosgrove,
1985: 46). Google Street View's particular production
of landscape involves the gradual accumulation of geo-
graphic information into a new market commodity: a
virtual navigation platform which users pay (through
monetary or informational exchanges) to access, use,
and manage various functions ranging from explor-
ation to API use by third party applications.
Elements of the environment, such as buildings,
streets and parks, are framed and captured as land-
scapes when they are fixed on a visual medium. In
Cosgrove's terms, this is the point when each photo-
graphic image is ``produced by the sovereign eye,'' into
a landscape where ``space is rendered the property of
the individual detached observer, from whose location
it is a dependent, appropriated object'' (Cosgrove,
1985: 48­49). This singular perspective is modified by
the personalized production of landscapes enabled
through the customized views offered by Google
Street View.
The landscape production by Google's cameras
results from the appropriation of visual information,
the first step in the process of commodification of
Google Street View. In terms of property rights, these
photographs are protected by copyright in the US and
other jurisdictions since they amount to original images
fixed on a tangible medium of expression. On the other
hand, the production of Google Street View images
implies more than the photographs captured by the
Leo
´n 7
vehicles. As will be discussed below, regulators have
shown that Google vehicles collect wireless communi-
cations data from private wireless networks in the
course of taking Google Street View photographs.
This brings an added layer of complexity to the prop-
erty regime of Google Street View because wireless
communications (and the private information therein)
fall under a different regulatory framework to photo-
graphs. This highlights how privacy issues have become
increasingly intertwined with the commodification of
geographic information in the digital economy.
While Google Street View is a result of commodifi-
cation through landscape creation, each individual
landscape image has negligible value for Google. The
value creation of Google Street View takes place
through the massive integration of individual images
into a navigable virtual environment. Google Street
View is then made into a commodity through the accu-
mulation of millions of infinitesimally valuable proper-
ties, which are assembled into a coherent, fully
interactive virtual ``landscape of landscapes.'' This
product only accrues value once it is functional and
released online for users to navigate it. This value is
fully realized when different kinds of users interact
with the features of Google Street View and Maps
through monetary and/or informational exchanges.
There are two kinds of users for Google Street View
and Maps: first, the advertisers, who pay to have their
ads shown on the map itself. Second: the end users of
the maps and the map API. For the advertisers, Google
Street View and Maps represent a way to reach and
research geographically targeted market segments at
increasingly more detailed scales. On the other hand,
end users have a variety of interactions with this prod-
uct that include monetary and non-monetary transac-
tions and range from exploration and navigation to
service provision through the use of the Google Maps
API in third party applications.
The first tier of end users engages in a non-monetary
transaction involving the collection of their search
information by Google in exchange for the use value
provided by Google Street View: navigation directions
and detailed place-based information. A second tier of
users (Standard API users) can integrate the Google
Maps API, which includes Google Street View, into
their own online services. The paid service for this tier
includes a volume of 25,000 map load requests per day
for a period of 90 consecutive days. For requests
exceeding this limit, there is a third tier of service
(Premium API users), which charges according to the
volume of requests (Google, n.d.). For users to inte-
grate the Google Maps API into their services, access
must be open to the public and free of charge, unless an
exception is explicitly specified in the agreement with
Google (Google, 2015).
In these transactions, governed by licenses, users
provide information or money in exchange for different
uses of the Google Street View and Maps. Through this
triangular exchange between advertisers, end users, and
Google (through Google Maps/Street View and Google
Search), the commodity realizes its value in different
ways for the three parties involved. The users receive
the service of navigation and exploration (for first tier
end users), or a product that they can incorporate into
their own applications (for second and third tier API
end users); Google receives a combination of users'
information, money, and the diffusion of their product
through third party services (API users). Google
then uses this information to sell search engine
and map space to advertisers, who in turn receive
increased exposure. These exchanges are summarized
in Table 2.

The production of the Google Street View environ-
ment and its appropriation of images into landscapes
presents two related concerns that play a fundamental
role in shaping the property regime of this commodity:
property and privacy. Above I discussed the construc-
tion of property through the allocation of specific rights
as a result of monetary and non-monetary exchanges.
These exchanges in turn create roles that come together
to form a property regime specific to Google Street
View images. Table 3 summarizes these exchanges
and the rights assigned through to them to various
roles, using the terminology of Schlager and Ostrom
(1992). In the following subsection, I turn to the role
of privacy in the creation of a property regime specific
to Google Street View.
The role of privacy in Google Street View's
property regimes
In the preceding subsection, I outlined two key issues in
the creation of a property regime for Google Street
View: property and privacy. The technological means
of imagery collection and the very nature of the Google
Street View platform make these concerns increasingly
difficult to disentangle. In this context, the second con-
cern, privacy, stems initially from the capture of Google
Street View images as well as from the degree of inva-
sion of someone's private sphere implicated by this
action. Since this is a service offered in many countries,
the property regimes shaping its commodification will
vary across jurisdictions. These variations affect
the product itself. For example, the information
included on the map can change due to geopolitical
considerations, and the various privacy regulations
can restrict the collection of certain data. While there
are many factors that may influence the local configur-
ation of these property regimes, a key indicator is the
relative weight given in each case to the privacy and
property of the images and information involved in
the triangular exchange (users ­ Google ­ advertisers)
explained above.
In order to discuss the privacy implications of
Google Street View imagery collection, it must be
noted, as Elwood and Leszczynski have done (2011)
that the geoweb has catalyzed a reconceptualization
of privacy, as well as the associated social (and legal)
struggles to define, maintain, and protect it. The fact
that large datasets and imagery can be directly linked
with particular physical locations creates a qualitatively
different context in which to discuss what privacy
means and how it is constructed. As Google Street
View and other products in the geoweb have shown,
large and networked datasets are becoming associated
with spatial presence in ways that were unavailable to
purely textual, tabular, or numerical data. This funda-
mentally alters the position and relations between
actors who produce, access, use, or control these data
(Elwood and Leszczynski, 2011). These relations are
technological as much as they are institutional, polit-
ical, and economic.
In the case of Google Street View, the production of
this digital commodity must negotiate shifting concep-
tions of privacy, which are further transformed by the
very act of imagery collection. In the course of collect-
ing imagery, Google Street View vehicles physically
navigate public thoroughfares. However, the public

status of the information they collect is uneven and
contingent. For example, Google has acknowledged
that some Street View images may contain sensitive
information. In light of this, the company announced
measures to blur people's faces and vehicle license
plates (Google, n.d.), as well as to comply with individ-
ual, community and government requests to omit cer-
tain locations from Google Maps and Google Street
View (Google, n.d.; IT Security Editors, n.d.).
Furthermore, governments often submit content
takedown requests to Google based on a range of cri-
teria. While technically subject to legal oversight, it is
Google that executes the content removal. The all-
encompassing image capture of Google Street View
combined with the power of discretionary removal
that ultimately lies in the hands of Google have made
privacy a major point of contention regarding the oper-
ations of this service in a number of countries. The
privacy concerns that began with the collection of ima-
gery intensified in 2010 when Data Protection
Authorities in Ireland and Germany pressed Google
to admit that in the course of their operations,
Google Street View cars also collected information
about private wireless networks (Google, 2010), such
as router identifiers (SSIDs), computer MAC addresses,
and even emails and browsing content in the case of
unencrypted networks (Stroz, 2010). Google Street
View has thus been identified as a threat to privacy
and received renewed scrutiny around the world
through government investigations and private lawsuits
(Electronic Privacy Information Center, 2010).
These incidents have highlighted two aspects of priv-
acy associated with the production of Google Street
View: the collection of the images themselves, and the
collection of wireless network data that takes places
during image capture. These two aspects cannot be
readily separated since the technology used for naviga-
tion purposes and image collection contained the code
that collected wireless network data (Stroz, 2010).
According to Google, their vehicles collected both
types of data from 2006 until May of 2010, when they
allegedly stopped this practice (Google, 2010).
In the United States, there have been private and
class action lawsuits from parties who see Google
Street View's imagery collection as a breach of privacy
(Geissler, 2012). This concern over image collection has
been compounded with responses focused on the wire-
less data collection. European countries have been the
most vocal against both types of data collection. For
example, there has been public outcry and massive
removal requests in the UK and Germany. In Greece,
the Czech Republic and Austria, data protection autho-
rities temporarily banned collection to allow further
review (Electronic Privacy Information Center, 2010;
Geissler, 2012).
In light of these accusations in the US and the EU,
Google argued that their cameras capture the same
images that any passerby on the street would be able
to see. However, most Street View cameras stand nine-
feet tall, mounted on top of fast-moving vehicles, have
360-degree vision and produce high-resolution images
that can be augmented by zoom. Critics argue that the
combination of these features means that ``most Street
View imagery is created in a way that exceeds normal
human capability'' (Geissler, 2012: 903), concluding
that it should be considered in a different bracket
from ordinary public view.
With regard to imagery collection, the courts in
Germany and the United States have been asked to
decide whether Google Street View's image collection
violates individuals' right to privacy. While the plain-
tiffs' claims have been dismissed in both countries,
Geissler points out that there is an underlying contrast
in how the right to privacy has been construed in each
jurisdiction. In the United States, tort law places a
much higher burden on private citizens to protect
their own privacy (Geissler, 2012: 926). In Germany,
``courts have interpreted [text in the German consti-
tution] to imply a right to privacy that not only
encompasses an affirmative government obligation to
protect this right, but one that also constrains pri-
vate parties' interactions with other private parties''
(Geissler, 2012: 917). While Google vehicles continue
to operate in Germany, the company reported that
as of November 2014 they are not engaged in the
collection of Street View imagery for public display,
and only use it to improve Google Maps (Google
Deutschland, 2014).
The privacy issues raised by the collection of ima-
gery are further complicated by the associated collec-
tion of wireless communications data by Google
vehicles. While these are developing in different ways
across several jurisdictions, they highlight how the
property regimes of digital information often tran-
scend both property rights considered in isolation
and the regulatory frameworks that govern any one
of the inputs into new informational products. The
integration of debates on privacy, ownership, and
the commodification of geographic information is cru-
cial to understand the generation of value by products
such as Google Street View. How privacy is concep-
tualized, debated, and resolved plays an important
role in how informational commodities are produced
and commercialized. Along with the allocation of
rights of access, use and ownership of Google Street
View images, the particular constructions of privacy
shaped by variegated legal challenges across jurisdic-
tions contribute to construct the property regimes gov-
erning the production and appropriation of value
though this product.

Conclusion
The analysis of Google Street View presented in this
article applies Schlager and Ostrom's property regimes
conceptual schema (1992) to explore an instance of the
commodification of geographic information on the
Internet. This analysis represents an extension of
the property regimes schema by considering the chal-
lenges of digital information to the allocation of
property rights and by focusing on the role of
technologies in the transformation of legal protections.
Furthermore, by incorporating the discussions on
privacy with the allocation of property rights, this
analysis brings into discussion the different values
and logics (such as privacy) that have become increas-
ingly intertwined in the commodification of digital
information. Finally, by focusing on the transition
from printed maps to digital maps and illustrating
the emergence of new property regimes in the case
of Google Street View, the article highlights how the
characteristics of geographic information and its
technological developments affect its new possibilities
for its commodification in digital networked environ-
ments. The framework presented here can be deployed
productively to examine other geographic information
platforms (such as Bing Maps or OpenStreetMap)
and understand the commodification of different
types of information (such as satellite, crowdsourced,
and health data).
In a broader context, the arguments in this article
contribute to a political economy of geographic infor-
mation on the Internet. This has been characterized by
the reduction of the role of the state in the ``carto-
graphic project,'' a process which has been accelerated
by neoliberalization (Leszczynski, 2012). In combin-
ation with technological changes such as digitization,
the movement away from state-centric cartography
towards an expanding geographic information ecosys-
tem is necessarily implicated in the redistribution of
power dynamics between the state and other actors.
It is at this juncture that we should understand
and analyze the emergence of a digital economy of
geographic information and its expansion on the
Internet through processes of commodification. At
a time when evermore information is becoming
digitized, and much of it commodified, it remains a
necessary task to conduct increasingly granular ana-
lyses of the production of value through information
and understand their meaning within broader social
transformations.
