Abstract
Background
Law enforcement depends on cooperation from the public and crime victims to protect citi-
zens and maintain public safety; however, many crimes are not reported to police because
of fear of repercussions or because the crime is considered trivial. It is unclear how police
reporting affects the incidence of future victimization.
Objective
To evaluate the association between reporting victimization to police and incident future
victimization.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using National Crime Victimization Survey
2008­2012 data. Participants were 12+ years old household members who may or may not
be victimized, were followed biannually for 3 years, and who completed at least one follow-
up survey after their first reported victimization between 2008 and 2012. Crude and adjusted
generalized linear mixed regression for survey data with Poisson link were used to compare
rates of future victimization.
Results
Out of 18,657 eligible participants, 41% participants reported to their initial victimization to
police and had a future victimization rate of 42.8/100 person-years (PY) (95% CI: 40.7,
44.8). The future victimization rate of those who did not report to the police (59%) was 55.0/
100 PY (95% CI: 53.0, 57.0). The adjusted rate ratio comparing police reporting to not
reporting was 0.78 (95%CI: 0.72, 0.84) for all future victimizations, 0.80 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.90)
for interpersonal violence, 0.73 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.78) for thefts, and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.07)
for burglaries.

Conclusions
Reporting victimization to police is associated with fewer future victimization, underscoring
the importance of police reporting in crime prevention. This association may be attributed to
police action and victim services provisions resulting from reporting.
Introduction
Government policies designed to alleviate the public health burden of violence generally con-
sider law enforcement officials as important resources for violence prevention. A fundamental
component of such crime-control efforts is the willingness of the public, particularly victims of
crime, to mobilize legal authorities to resolve public safety threats [1]. Without active commu-
nity involvement the police are less likely to detect violent crimes, arrest suspects, and effec-
tively allocate crime-control resources to communities [2]. However, according to recent
national-level estimates, approximately 54 percent of violent victimizations are not reported to
the police [3].
Several individual, situational, and contextual factors reliably predict whether or not vic-
tims mobilize police services [4­7]. Research suggests that reporting of victimizations to
police may vary by victim and offender characteristics, including injuries received, presence
of bystanders, and use of weapons [8­14]. It is documented that African Americans, Hispan-
ics, and people living in disadvantaged neighborhoods experience higher rates of violence
than Whites and those from low-poverty neighborhoods [3,15]. Furthermore, it has been
suspected that police services are not as robust or effectively delivered to minority groups in
some communities, which could translate into race-specific effects of police notification on
subsequent victimization risk [16,17]. Thus, both police notification and its impact on sub-
sequent experiences with violence and property crime may also vary by victim's racial/ eth-
nic background.
Victims are also concerned about retaliatory action from perpetrators in case of police
notification [18­20] which may preclude them from reporting. Reporting practices are also
important for understanding the mechanisms of repeat victimization [21]. Research shows
that prior victimization is strongly associated with risk of future victimization [22­25].
Research on repeat victimization raises questions about the implications of police reporting
on personal safety. But comparatively few studies have moved beyond the question of "why
victims notify the police" to questions about the ramifications of reporting [25,26]. The only
study that assessed the personal ramifications of reporting to the police has been conducted
in the context of intimate partner violence [25]. Another ecologic study conducted in the
United Kingdom assessed the association of anonymous police reporting with violence and
violence-related injuries [26]. Both these studies reported that police reporting was associ-
ated with fewer future victimization/ crime. But there is no information about how reporting
to police affects all forms of interpersonal violence including robberies, assaults, gang vio-
lence and property crimes like thefts and burglaries. Addressing this knowledge gap may
help inform policies about how police engage victims, particularly those in minority
communities.
In this study, we evaluated the association of reporting victimization to police with the inci-
dence of future victimizations. The study used National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS)
data, which is the only nationally representative incident-level crime and victimization data
that collects detailed victim and social contextual data about each event [27].

Methods
Participants and procedures
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) 2008­2012, a nationally representative, self-reported, longitudinal survey of
incident non-fatal crime reports, designed to assess the rates of non-fatal crime victimization
in the United States (US) [27]. The survey is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics and
the data is collected by the US census bureau. The NCVS is a household based survey of 90,000
households that targets 12 years or older household residents. The housing units and group
quarters are clustered within counties, groups of counties, and large metropolitan areas. The
survey excludes residents under 12 years of age, crew members of maritime vessels, personnel
living in military barracks, the homeless, prison inmates, US citizens living abroad, and foreign
visitors [28]. The initial survey is a face-to-face interview after which the participants take tele-
phone surveys every six months for three years. Each participant takes up to seven surveys con-
tributing a maximum of 3.5 years of person-time in the NCVS. Participants who completed at
least one follow-up survey after their first reported victimization during 2008­2012 were
included in this study. Due to the secondary and de-identified nature of the publicly available
National Crime Victimization Survey data used for this study, it was determined `not human
subject research' by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa.
Measures
Participants who reported their first victimization to the police, between 2008 and 2012, were
considered exposed and those who did not report their initial victimization to the police were
considered unexposed. Thus the exposure variable was a binary variable. After the initial vic-
timization, they were followed over time to assess the rate of subsequent victimization. The fol-
low-up time varied based on when the participants reported their initial victimization, and
their last completed follow-up (Fig 1). Fig 1, provides examples of how the eligible person-time
on the study (TS
) was calculated for each participant and how it compared with the person-
time of follow-up on the NCVS study (TNCVS
). Participants who did not report any victimiza-
tion (P4), did not take a follow-up survey after the first victimization report (P8), were enrolled
towards the end of the follow-up period from July-December 2012 (P5), or reported their first
victimization at the end of follow-up period (P10) were not eligible for this study; hence repre-
sented in Fig 1 with TS
= 0. Participants who were enrolled in NCVS before 2008 (P1 and P4)
could have had their first victimization before the one observed in Fig 1, however, we did not
have information on that since we defined our study observation period between 2008 and
2012.
During the follow-up surveys participants reported future victimizations that occurred after
the initial victimization, these subsequent (or future) victimizations were categorized as inter-
personal violence (including sexual assaults, robberies, threatened assaults and threatened
rape), burglary (including forced entry into a property), and theft (including motor vehicle
theft and pickpocketing). The overall future victimizations, future interpersonal violence vic-
timizations, future burglary victimizations, and future theft victimizations were accounted as
count variables. The future victimization counts were divided by the total person time on the
study (TS
) to calculate rates of future victimizations per 100 person-years.
To identify potential covariates for controlling confounding, a directed acyclic graph [29]
was developed using previously published literature [4­20] and consensus among the co-
authors. A directed acyclic graph, also known as causal diagram, allows to identify a minimal
sufficient set of well measured variables that controls for all known confounding. The minimal

sufficient set of variables required to control for all known confounding included initial victim-
ization type (interpersonal violence/ burglaries/ thefts), victim's baseline age (continuous), sex
(male/ female), race (White/ African American/ American Indian Alaska Native/ Asian), eth-
nicity (Hispanic/ non-Hispanic), baseline household income (<$25,000/ $25,000-$49,999/
$50,000 ­$74,999/ > = $75,000), education (< high school/ high school graduate/ some col-
lege/ associate degree/ bachelor's degree/ master's +), offender sex (male/ female/ not known),
victim-offender relationship (stranger/ acquaintance), victimization location (inside home/
outside home/ friend's home/ commercial place/ parking places/ school/ public places/ other),
victim injury (yes/ no), and bystander presence (yes/ no/ don't know). We hypothesized that
the relationship between reporting to police and the incidence of future victimization may vary
by race of the victim and victim-offender relationship. Hence, we explored effect measure mod-
ification by these characteristics by examining the p-value of the interaction term in the regres-
sion analyses; we reported stratified rate ratio estimates.
Statistical analysis
We used survey statistics (surveymeans, surveyfreq, surveyreg) in SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC)
to calculate weighted frequencies, rates, and unadjusted and adjusted rate differences of future
victimization comparing those who reported their initial victimization to the police and those
who did not.
We used generalized linear mixed Poisson models for multilevel survey data to compare the
rates of future victimization among those who reported their initial victimization to the police
and those who did not, while accounting for clustering in the survey design. These analyses
were conducted using SurveyGLIM in LISREL9 (SSI Inc., Skokie, IL) to estimate weighted
unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Statistical analyses
were conducted in 2014­2015.

However, the above analyses may have potential selection bias based on when the initial vic-
timization occurred during the follow-up (which is when the exposure to police reporting is
measured). This can be assessed by the length of time survey participants were followed after
their initial victimization (Fig 1). To assess the effect of the potential selection bias on the asso-
ciation between police reporting and future victimization, we conducted sensitivity analyses.
We restricted the analyses sample based on follow-up cutoffs of 6 months, 12 months, and 24
months. We then examined the association of police reporting with future victimization in
each of the restricted sample files separately and compared the rate ratios with the overall rate
ratio estimate.
Results
Between 2008 and 2012, a total of 283,519 individuals participated in the NCVS. There were
256,558 participants who were never victimized and 8304 who did not take follow-up surveys
after initial victimization; these participants were excluded from this study. The remaining
18,657 participants who took at least one follow-up survey after their initial victimization were
eligible for this study (Fig 2). They took a total of 45,255 follow-up surveys (median = 2;
range = 1­6) and reported 10,155 subsequent victimizations (median = 1; range = 0­10), and
provided 22627.5 person-years of follow-up (median = 1 year; range = 0.5­3 years). The initial
victimizations of 7,724 (41%) participants were reported to police, while those of 10,933 partic-
ipants were not reported to the police. Of the 45,255 follow-up interviews, 899 were taken by
proxies.
The median age of all eligible participants was 39.7 years (interquartile range: 26.2, 52.2),
50.4% of whom were females (Table 1). The majority of participants were White (78.3%), fol-
lowed by African American (15.7%). At baseline, more than two thirds of the participants were
victims of thefts, another 14.8% were victims of burglaries, and 16.3% were victims of interper-
sonal violence. The majority of offenders were males (80%); 14% of offenders were victim's

The initial victimization was reported to the police more often by females (41.8%) than
males (39.9%); by African Americans (44.2%) than Whites (40.6%), American Indians and
Alaska natives (37.6%), or Asian, Hawaiians, or pacific islanders (33.7%); by non-Hispanics
(41.6%) than Hispanics (36.7%); by those with less than $25,000 annual income (41.8%) than
those with at least a $25,000 annual income (40.1%); in victimizations where the offender was
an acquaintance (43.9%) than where the offender was a stranger (40.4%); by high school or
more educated victims (59.1%) than victims with less than high school education (33.1%). The
most often reported initial victimization was burglary (59.1%) followed by interpersonal vio-
lence (51.5%) and theft (34.4%). Initial victimizations that occurred in school were less often
reported to the police (20.5%) than victimizations that occurred at home (49.9%), outside the
home (38.1%), friend's home (55.8%), commercial place (34.2%), parking places (51.1%), pub-
lic places (41.8%), and other locations (33.3%).
The crude rate of all subsequent victimizations among those who reported their initial vic-
timization to the police was 42.8/ 100 person-years (95%CI: 40.7, 44.8), compared to 55.0/ 100
person-years (95%CI: 53.0, 57.0) among those who did not report initial victimization to the
police (Table 2). The adjusted rate difference of subsequent victimizations between exposed
and unexposed was -13.5/ 100 person years (95%CI: -16.3, -10.7).
The adjusted RR suggest that overall future victimizations were 22% lower when the initial
victimization was reported to the police relative to when it was not reported (RR: 0.78, 95%CI:
0.74, 0.82), future interpersonal violence victimizations were 20% lower (RR: 0.80, 95%CI: 0.72,
0.90), and future thefts were 27% lower (RR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.68, 0.78) (Table 2). Future burglar-
ies, however, did not decline with police reporting relative to not reporting (RR: 0.95, 95%CI:
0.84, 1.07) (Table 2).
The results from the sensitivity analysis show that the rate ratio for all future victimizations
from the 6 month follow-up restricted (cutoff) sample was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.80); from the 12
month follow-up restricted sample, RR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.80); and from the 24 month fol-
low-up restricted sample, RR = 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.81). In essence, the rate ratios after sample

restriction did not change substantively compared to the overall RR reported in Table 2, 0.78
(95% CI: 0.74, 0.82). This suggests that our results are robust and there may not be any selection
bias arising due to the timing of initial victimization and the amount of follow-up.
Police reporting was associated with fewer subsequent victimizations among all racial/ eth-
nic groups as compared to not reporting (Table 3). We observed an effect measure modifica-
tion of the exposure-outcome relationship by initial victim-offender relationship among the
African Americans but not among other racial/ ethnic groups (Table 3). African Americans
who reported stranger perpetrated victimization to the police did not experience a decline in
the rate of future victimization as compared to African Americans who did not report to the
police (RR:0.96, 95%CI: 0.83, 1.11).
Although insignificant due to small sample sizes, there were other race and initial victim-
offender relationship based differences worth mentioning (Table 3). African Americans who

Police Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0160072 July 28, 2016 8 / 12
reported stranger perpetrated victimization to the police experienced a higher rate of burglaries
(RR: 1.21, 95%CI: 0.89, 1.63) and no change in rate of thefts (RR: 0.93, 95%CI: 0.77, 1.11) as
compared to African Americans who did not report stranger-perpetrated victimization to the
police. American and Alaska Natives who reported to the police experienced slightly higher
subsequent interpersonal violence victimizations as compared to Natives who did not report to
the police (RR: 1.18, 95%CI: 0.70, 2.00). Hispanics who reported to the police did not experi-
ence any change in the rate of subsequent interpersonal violence victimization as compared to
the Hispanics who did not report (RR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.73, 1.28). However, Hispanics who
reported an acquaintance perpetrated victimization experienced more subsequent victimiza-
tions as compared to Hispanics who did not report acquaintance perpetrated interpersonal vio-
lence (RR: 1.21, 95%CI: 0.75, 1.94).
Discussion
In this study, we used a nationally generalizable NCVS data, and observed that police reporting
was associated with 22% fewer subsequent victimizations, particularly 20% fewer interpersonal
violence victimizations and 27% fewer thefts. For every 100 victimizations that were reported
to the police there were 13.5 fewer subsequent victimizations, four of which were interpersonal
violence and nine of which were thefts. Overall, participants from all racial groups who
reported to the police experienced fewer future victimizations.
Our results align with the study conducted in Cardiff, UK, where anonymized police report-
ing of violent crime indices from emergency department visits was associated with 42% fewer
violence-related injuries in Cardiff [26]. However, this association is ecologic [26]. In this
study, we evaluated the association of police reporting with the incidence of subsequent victim-
ization on the same victims. The only other similar study was conducted among victims of inti-
mate partner violence [25]. In that study, police involvement was associated with 48% fewer
future incidences of domestic violence. This study also used the NCVS data to evaluate the
repeat domestic violence victimizations from 1992­2002 [25].
There are several reasons to expect that police reporting of an incident might deter future
victimization. First, police action may result in arrest and conviction of offenders thereby pro-
tecting the victim from re-victimization by the same offender. Second, the offenders may also
view police intervention, irrespective of arrest, as stigmatizing, which may deter them from tar-
geting the same victim again [30]. The stigma and shaming may be further compounded if/
when police investigations acquire and release digital evidence (images or videos) that end up
on social media and news outlets [31,32]. The digital evidence may also aid the police in identi-
fying, arresting, and convicting the offenders [31]. Third, offenders may be deterred if the
police warn or indicate future arrest is likely when they intervene [33]. However, the deterrence
potential of stigma and arrest might be effective insofar as the same offender, whether acquain-
tance or stranger, intends to target that victim again [34]. Fourth, victims might acquire strate-
gies to effectively lower their vulnerability to victimization as a result of their contact with the
police. For instance, the police might raise their awareness about high-risk activities and neigh-
borhoods and inform victims of strategies to safeguard themselves from future harm. Informa-
tion and support is often provided by victim services that are generally affiliated with local
police jurisdictions [35]. Lastly, there is evidence to suggest that reporting to police improves
seeking of mental and physical health services by victims, which may also reduce the potential
for subsequent victimization [35]. Altogether, these potential preventive outcomes of police
notification may lower the risk of future victimizations as seen in the current study.
However, we observed that only 41% study participants reported their initial victimization
to police. This is similar to previous studies that revealed the low prevalence of police reporting
Police Reporting and Future Crime Victimizations
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0160072 July 28, 2016 9 / 12
of victimizations [8­14]. Low reporting of victimization is also prevalent in cyber victimiza-
tions [36]. Several factors like retaliation from offenders, perceived triviality of the crime, rela-
tionship to the offender, societal stigma and stress, or distrust and perceived incompetence of
law enforcement may explain the low prevalence of police reporting by victims [7,9].
While all other racial groups experienced 23% or more decline in subsequent victimization
rates, African Americans experienced only an 11% decline. This was because in this study the
African Americans who reported stranger perpetrated victimization experienced similar or
higher rates of victimizations, especially property crimes (burglary), than African Americans
who did not report stranger perpetrated victimization to the police (Table 3). This may suggest
a lack of trust between the police and African American victims as suggested in previous stud-
ies from Philadelphia [16] and Washington, DC [17]. American Indians and Alaska Natives
who reported to the police experienced a higher rate of acquaintance perpetrated interpersonal
violence victimization (Table 3). American Indians and Alaska Native populations have been
noted to experience high rates of violence victimizations [3], and the most common reason of
not reporting violent victimizations to police is fear of reprisal [19] suggesting a potential retal-
iatory response.
Limitations
In this study, we used self-reported NCVS data with 6 month recall, which may induce recall
bias leading to under- or over-reporting of victimization to police and exposure. There are
three possibilities. First, victims may under- or over-report future victimizations. If the under-
or over-reporting is non-differential between the exposed and unexposed, then the rate ratio
estimates will not be affected, but, the rate difference estimates will decrease or increase, respec-
tively. The second possibility is under-reporting (more likely than over-reporting) of both
exposed and unexposed events at the initial victimization (under-reporting of person-time),
which will also result in under-reporting of future victimizations (under-reporting of out-
comes); assuming non-differential reporting, this will not change the estimates. The third, and
the most plausible, is differential reporting of the initial victimizations. Here, the exposed
events are likely to be reported accurately­because police are usually informed in case of more
traumatic events which may be recalled accurately; and, the unexposed are under-reported
leading to under-reporting of future victimizations. This possibility will also not change any
estimates. Hence, our estimates seem robust to recall bias.
About 1.9% (n = 899) of interviews were proxy interviews, which may be of concern, how-
ever, after excluding the proxy interviews from the analyses our estimates did not change
appreciably.
Police reporting is not the same as police action or arrests. Our findings may be interpreted
to suggest that police reporting may have a protective association with future victimization
independent of police action; however, most police reporting is followed by some police action
whether the victim is aware of it or not [26].
Lastly, although our estimates are generated from a well-grounded specification, this is an
observational study. Even after controlling for many potential confounders there may be other
unknown/unmeasured confounders that we cannot control for in the analyses. Hence, the rate
ratios from this study are measures of association, not causation. Since we cannot conduct a
randomized trial to observe this exposure-outcome relationship, the best potential way to get
closer to a causal interpretation may be through a natural experiment or instrumental variable
approach. Such an approach posits that if there is a randomly distributed natural variable (e.g.,
a policy that may be instituted in some states but not others) which predicts the exposure
(prevalence of police reporting), does not have a direct relationship with the outcome (future

victimization), and is not associated with known confounders of the exposure-outcome rela-
tionship, then we may be able to estimate the effect (causation) of the exposure on the
outcome.
Conclusions
We conducted a longitudinal study that allowed us to temporally examine how the rates of
future victimization change following a police report for baseline victimization in a nationally
representative sample of survey participants. Our results suggest that reporting victimizations
to police may reduce the victim's likelihood of future victimization. The protective association
of police reporting may be due to the victim's protective behaviors, police actions, and victim
services that provide mental and physical health services. However, in this study, less than half
of the victims reported their victimizations to the police. It is hence foreseeable, that an increase
in reporting of violent and property crimes to police may be an important factor in crime pre-
vention and control. Future studies may explore interventions to increase the prevalence of
police reporting by victims thereby reducing re-victimizations in future.
