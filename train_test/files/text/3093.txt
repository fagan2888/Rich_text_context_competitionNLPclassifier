THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZA-
tion defines preterm birth as a
gestational age at birth of less
than 37 completed gestational
weeks.1 Preterm birth is recognized as a
majorpublichealth problem by both cli-
nicians and researchers because it is the
leading cause of infant mortality in in-
dustrialized countries and also con-
tributes to substantial neurocognitive,
pulmonary, and ophthalmologic mor-
bidity.2-5 Caring for preterm infants also
incurs large health care expenditures.6
Most studies of morbidity and mortal-
ity among preterm infants have focused
on those born very preterm, ie, at gesta-
tional ages less than 32 weeks.7-17 For in-
fants born at 32 through 36 gestational
weeks, the risks are much lower, espe-
cially with recent advances in neonatal
intensive care.7,16 On the other hand,
from a public health perspective, births
at gestational ages of 32 through 36
weeks are much more common than
thoseatlessthan32gestationalweeks.7,18
Thus it is important to distinguish ab-
solute risk both from relative risk (RR)
and from public health impact (ie, etio-
logic fraction [EF]).
The RR indicates how much more
frequently a given outcome occurs in
persons with vs those without a risk
factor. The EF is the proportion of all
cases of the outcome occurring in a
given population that can be attrib-
uted to exposure to the risk factor; it is
sometimes referred to as the pop-
ulation-attributable risk.19 Because the
EF is a function of both the RR and
the population prevalence of exposure
to the risk factor, common risk factors

Context The World Health Organization defines preterm birth as birth at less than
37 completed gestational weeks, but most studies have focused on very preterm in-
fants (birth at 32 weeks) because of their high risk of mortality and serious morbid-
ity. However, infants born at 32 through 36 weeks are more common and their public
health impact has not been well studied.
Objective Toassessthequantitativecontributionofmild(birthat34-36gestationalweeks)
and moderate (birth at 32-33 gestational weeks) preterm birth to infant mortality.
Design, Setting, and Participants Population-based cohort study using linked
singleton live birth­infant death cohort files for US birth cohorts for 1985 and 1995
and Canadian birth cohorts (excluding Ontario) for 1985-1987 and 1992-1994.
Main Outcome Measures Relative risks (RRs) and etiologic fractions (EFs) for over-
all and cause-specific early neonatal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (age 7-27 days),
postneonatal (age 28-364 days), and total infant death among mild and moderate
preterm births vs term births (at 37 gestational weeks).
Results Relative risks for infant death from all causes among singletons born at 32
through 33 gestational weeks were 6.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.1-7.0) in the
United States in 1995 and 15.2 (95% CI, 13.2-17.5) in Canada in 1992-1994; among
singletons born at 34 through 36 gestational weeks, the RRs were 2.9 (95% CI, 2.8-
3.0) and 4.5 (95% CI, 4.0-5.0), respectively. Corresponding EFs were 3.2% and 4.8%,
respectively, at 32 through 33 gestational weeks and 6.3% and 8.0%, respectively, at
34 through 36 gestational weeks; the sum of the EFs for births at 32 through 33 and 34
through 36 gestational weeks exceeded those for births at 28 through 31 gestational
weeks. Substantial RRs were observed overall for the neonatal (eg, for early neonatal
deaths, 14.6 and 33.0 for US and Canadian infants, respectively, born at 32-33 gesta-
tional weeks; EFs, 3.6% and and 6.2% for US and Canadian infants, respectively) and
postneonatal (RRs, 2.1-3.8 and 3.0-7.0 for US and Canadian infants, respectively, born
at 32-36 gestational weeks; EFs, 2.7%-5.8% and 3.0%-7.0% for the same groups, re-
spectively) periods and for death due to asphyxia, infection, sudden infant death syn-
drome, and external causes. Except for a reduction in the RR and EF for neonatal mor-
tality due to infection, the patterns have changed little since 1985 in either country.
Conclusions Mild­ and moderate­preterm birth infants are at high RR for death dur-
ing infancy and are responsible for an important fraction of infant deaths.

account for much higher EFs than do
rare risk factors. For example, an
anomalous coronary artery is associ-
ated with a very high RR of myocar-
dial infarction but (owing to its
extreme rarity) a very low EF. By con-
trast, cigarette smoking, which is
highly prevalent, accounts for an
appreciable portion of myocardial
infarctions despite its modestly
elevated RR.
We hypothesized that mild and
moderate preterm births, which we
define as live births at 34 through 36
and 32 through 33 completed weeks
of gestation, respectively, are associ-
ated with an increased risk of infant
mortality relative to term births. We
further hypothesized that mild and
moderate preterm births account for
an important fraction of infant deaths.
In particular, we suspected that the
increased RRs and substantial EFs for
infant death would be most pro-
nounced for specific groups of causes
(infection, sudden infant death syn-
drome [SIDS], and external causes
such as unintentional injuries and
abuse) and would be concentrated in
the postneonatal rather than the neo-
natal period. Finally, we hypothesized
that these increased risks would be
observed in both the United States
and Canada and would have dimin-
ished only slightly over time.
METHODS
We used 4 data sources for our analy-
sis, all based on linked live birth­infant
death cohort files. For the United States,
we used the 1985 (n = 3619650) and
1995 (n = 3866513) birth cohorts, and
for Canada, we used the files for 1985-
1987 (n = 692 579) and 1992-1994
(n = 726 435) after excluding the prov-
ince of Ontario because of docu-
mented problems with data quality. We
used 3 years for each time period in
Canadatoincreasethenumberofdeaths
in the file and thus provide more stable
estimates of risk. Data from Newfound-
landwerenotavailablefortheearlierpe-
riod. For the US file, gestational age is
based on the algorithm used by the Na-
tionalCenterforHealthStatistics,which
is calculated from date of the last men-
strual period unless the last menstrual
period is not reported or birth weight is
incompatible with the reported gesta-
tional age, in which case the clinical es-
timate (as recorded on the birth certifi-
cate) is substituted. For the Canadian
file, gestational age is that recorded on
the birth certificate by the responsible
physician, which, in recent years, ap-
pears to be based primarily on early ul-
trasound dating. For causes of death, we
used the classification proposed by the
International Collaborative Effort on
Perinatal and Infant Mortality, which
groups the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes
for the underlying cause of death re-
corded on death certificates.20 The In-
ternational Collaborative Effort on Peri-
natal and Infant Mortality grouping
includes congenital conditions, imma-
turity-related conditions, asphyxia-
related conditions, infections, other spe-
cific conditions, SIDS, external causes,
and remaining causes.
For data analysis, we restricted the
study sample to singleton live births and
categorized age at death as early neo-
natal (age 0-6 days), late neonatal (age
7-27 days), or postneonatal (age 28-
364 days). We calculated risks for late
neonatal death based on early neo-
natal survivors and risks for post-
neonatal death based on late neonatal
survivors. Cause-specific mortality risks
are based on all infants at risk of death
for each cause; ie, they include infants
dying of other causes in the denomi-
nator. Effects were expressed as ad-
justed RRs and 95% confidence inter-
vals and EFs based on multiple logistic
regression analyses; term (37 com-
pleted gestational weeks) births served
as the reference group for these calcu-
lations. Odds ratios were converted to
RRs using the method of Zhang and
Yu.21 The US regression models were
adjusted for maternal age (age 20, 20-
34, and 35 years), parity (primipa-
rous vs multiparous), race (non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, and other), and education
(12, 12, 13-15, and 16 completed
years of school), while only age and par-
ity were available for adjustment in the
Canadian file. All analyses were per-
formed with SAS-PC version 6.12 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Etiologic fractions for the poly-
chotomous categories of preterm birth
(birth at 28, 28-31, 32-33, and
34-36 gestational weeks) were based
on the method of Miettinen19 as fol-
lows:
EF =
Pi
(RRi
- 1)
Pi
(RRi
- 1) + 1
where Pi
is the prevalence of the ith pre-
term gestational age category (28, 28-
31, 32-33, or 34-36 weeks), RRi
is the
corresponding RR of mortality in that
group relative to term (birth at 37 ges-
tational weeks) infants and  indi-
cates summation over the i preterm
categories.
RESULTS
Infant mortality rates and gestational
age distributions among all live births
are shown in TABLE 1 for both coun-
tries and both time periods. Preterm
birth rates and early neonatal, late neo-
natal, and postneonatal mortality rates
were all lower in Canada than in the
United States for both time periods.
Mild (34-36 gestational weeks) pre-
term births comprised 6.3% and 7.6%
of all US live births in 1985 and 1995,
respectively; the proportions in Canada
were 4.5% in 1985-1987 and 4.9% in
1992-1994. For moderate (32-33 ges-
tational weeks) preterm births, the cor-
responding rates were 1.3% and 1.4%
in the United States and 0.7% and 0.8%
in Canada.
Because the RRs and EFs were simi-
lar for both time periods in both coun-
tries, data are presented only for the
more recent period (1995 in the United
States and 1992-1994 for Canada). For
each category of preterm birth, TABLE 2
shows the crude absolute and ad-
justed RRs and EFs for infant death
from all causes among all singleton live
births. Separate estimates are shown for
total infant mortality and early neona-
tal, late neonatal, and postneonatal mor-
tality. As expected, RRs and EFs were

highest for births at less than 28 ges-
tational weeks. Infants born at 32
through 33 gestational weeks were at
high RR of infant death in both coun-
tries. To our surprise, the largest RRs
were seen in the neonatal period. For
infants born at 34 through 36 gesta-
tional weeks, the RRs were somewhat
lower but still substantial and statisti-
cally significant. In general, the RRs
were higher in Canada than in the
United States. The EFs ranged from
3.0% to 6.2% for infants born at 32
through 33 gestational weeks and 5.8%
to 9.0% for those born at 34 through
36 gestational weeks and were slightly
higher in Canada. The sum of the EFs
for 32 through 33 and 34 through 36
gestational weeks exceeded those for in-
fants born at 28 through 31 gesta-
tional weeks for all 3 ages at death.
Congenital anomalies may lead to ei-
ther spontaneous or iatrogenic pre-
term delivery, but preterm birth can-
not cause these anomalies (although it
can increase the risk of death among in-
fants with anomalies). TABLE 3 pre-
sents a similar analysis to that shown
in Table 2 after excluding deaths due
to congenital conditions. The RRs and
EFs are only slightly lower than those
shown in Table 2.
Fewer moderately or mildly pre-
term infants died of asphyxia-related
conditions, and this resulted in rather
wide confidence intervals for the RRs.
Nonetheless, the risks were quite el-
evated, especially for infants born at 32
through 33 gestational weeks, as shown
in TABLE 4. As expected for this group
of causes, the excess deaths were con-
centrated in the neonatal period in both
countries. The EFs were substantial for
neonates born at 34 through 36 gesta-
tional weeks.
For deaths due to infection, we had
hypothesized increased risks in the
postneonatal period. As shown in
TABLE 5, this hypothesis was con-
firmed for both mild and moderate
preterm births in both countries,
although we were surprised to ob-
serve even higher RRs of death from in-
fection in the early and late neonatal pe-
riods than those in the postneonatal
period. Etiologic fractions were 4.2% to
5.4% for births at 32 through 33 ges-
tational weeks and ranged from 1.9%
to 10.9% for births at 34 through 36
gestational weeks. Additional adjust-
ment for maternal smoking for the
1995 US cohort had little effect on
RRs. With adjustment for smoking, RR
at 32 through 33 gestational weeks
was 8.0, the same as without adjust-
ment, and at 34 through 36 weeks,
3.0, compared with 3.1 without adjust-
ment. For infants born at 34 through
36 gestational weeks, EFs for early
and late neonatal death due to infec-
tion decreased between the 2 time
periods, eg, in the United States the
EF decreased from 16.0% in 1985 to
10.9% in 1995 for early neonatal
death and from 12.3% to 5.3% for
late neonatal death. These were the
only consistent temporal changes
observed.
TABLE 6 summarizes the results for
postneonatal deaths due to SIDS and
all external causes. The RRs ranged
from 1.7 to 1.9 in the mild preterm
category and 2.4 to 4.4 in the moder-
ate preterm category, and most were
statistically significant; for SIDS and
all external causes, these RRs were
slightly but nonsignificantly higher in
Canada than in the United States. In
both countries, EFs ranged from 1.5%
to 2.0% for births at 32 through 33
gestational weeks but rose to 3.8% to
5.1% for infants born at 34 through
36 gestational weeks. The latter values
exceeded the total EFs for infants
born at less than 28 and 28 through
31 gestational weeks. Additional
adjustment for maternal smoking for
the 1995 US cohort had little effect on
the RRs for SIDS. With adjustment,
the RR at 32 through 33 gestational
weeks was 2.1 vs 2.4 without adjust-
ment, and at 34 through 36 gesta-
tional weeks, 1.6 vs 1.7 without
adjustment.
COMMENT
Most of our hypotheses were sup-
ported by the data. Mildly and moder-
ately preterm infants did indeed have
high RRs and appreciable EFs for
postneonatal deaths due to infection,
SIDS, and external causes, including
abuse and maltreatment. We were
surprised,however,toobservethat their
risks were also elevated for neonatal
death, especially neonatal death due
to asphyxia and infection. Our results
highlight the difference between
the clinical and public health per-
spectives, ie, between absolute risk,
on the one hand, and RR and EF, on
the other.
Despite the low absolute risks of
death in these gestational age groups,

the RRs are quite elevated and, when
combined with their larger numbers
compared with more extreme pre-
term births, translate into a substan-
tialimpact at the population level. In
fact, the combined impact exceeded
that of infants born at 28 through 31
gestational weeks for all causes and
all 3 ages at death and even that of
infants born at less than 28 gesta-
tional weeks for postneonatal deaths.
These findings do not in any way
diminish the clinical and public
health importance of extremely pre-
term infants. Infants born at 27 ges-
tational weeks or earlier account for
a very large proportion of neonatal
deaths despite their rare occurrence
(0.7% in the United States and 0.4%
in Canada).
Our results were fairly consistent be-
tween the United States and Canada.
The RRs of mortality associated with
mild and moderate preterm birth were
generally higher in Canada. A small part
of these differences in gestational age­
specific mortality was explained by the
lower absolute and relative mortality
risks among US black vs white pre-
term infants, but the RRs for Canada re-
mained substantially higher than those
for the United States even after restrict-
ing the US analysis to non-Hispanic
whites (ie, 8.1 vs 15.2 at 32-33 gesta-
tional weeks and 3.3 vs 4.5 at 34-36 ges-
tational weeks for total infant mortal-
ity among all singleton live births). An
even smaller part of the difference was
the result of the slightly lower abso-
lute risks for term (birth at 37 gesta-
tional weeks) births in Canada (ie, to-
tal infant mortality of 3.0 vs 3.1 per
1000 live births for Canada in 1992-
1994 vs the United States in 1995). We
are currently investigating other po-
tential explanations and particularly
whether the differences might be arti-
facts caused by errors in estimation of
gestational age.22 Regardless of the ex-
planation, however, the prevalence of
births in these gestational age catego-
ries was much lower in Canada than in
the United States, and the EFs were
therefore similar in the 2 countries.
Except for a slight reduction in
neonatal deaths attributable to infec-
tion among infants born at 34
through 36 gestational weeks, the
patterns we observed have not
changed much over the last 10 years
in either country. In other words,
despite the continued reduction in
gestational age­specific mortality
with improvements in high-risk
obstetric and neonatal care,13,17,23
mild and moderate preterm births
continue to contribute an important
fraction of infant deaths from a vari-
ety of causes. Obstetricians should be
aware of these risks when contem-
plating preterm induction or cesar-
ean delivery, and pediatricians may

wish to consider closer monitoring of
mildly and moderately preterm
infants after hospital discharge. Peri-
natal researchers should include
births in these gestational age catego-
ries in studies of etiology and pre-
vention. Our findings indicate that
preventing the occurrence of mild
and moderate preterm births and of
death among such births remain
worthy targets for future research
and clinical intervention.
