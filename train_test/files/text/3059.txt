Serum Ascorbic Acid and Gallbladder Disease
Prevalence Among US Adults
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
Joel A. Simon, MD, MPH; Esther S. Hudes, PhD, MPH
Background: Ascorbic acid­deficient guinea pigs fre-
quently develop gallstones, and ascorbic acid status may
also affect the risk of gallbladder disease in humans. To
examine the relationship of ascorbic acid, an antioxi-
dant nutrient involved in cholesterol catabolism, to gall-
bladder disease, we analyzed data collected from a prob-
ability sample of US adults.
Methods: Analyses of data from 7042 women and 6088
men enrolled in the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey, 1988-1994, were performed.
Multiple logistic regression models stratified by sex were
examined, controlling for the effects of age, race, diet,
body mass index, and other potential confounders.
Results: A total of 761 women (11%) and 235 men (4%)
reported a history of clinical gallbladder disease (symp-
tomatic gallstones or cholecystectomy). Of the 9650 par-
ticipants without a history of clinical gallbladder dis-
ease or abdominal pain consistent with gallbladder disease,
and with valid abdominal ultrasonography, 408 (8%) of
4863 women and 274 (6%) of 4787 men had asymptom-
atic gallstones. Serum ascorbic acid level was inversely
related to prevalence of clinical and asymptomatic gall-
bladder disease among women, but not among men.
Among women, each SD (27 µmol/L) increase in serum
ascorbic acid level was independently associated with a
13% lower prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease
(P = .006) and asymptomatic gallstones (P = .048).
Conclusion: Ascorbic acid, which affects the catabo-
lism of cholesterol to bile acids and, in turn, the devel-
opment of gallbladder disease in experimental animals,
may affect the risk of gallbladder disease among women.

GALLBLADDER disease is
highly prevalent in the
United States.1 It has
been estimated that as
many as 20 million
Americans have gallstones that are com-
posed partially or entirely of choles-
terol.1-3 Gallstones form when bile that is
supersaturated with cholesterol under-
goes destabilization.4 Ascorbic acid af-
fects the rate-limiting step in the catabo-
lism of cholesterol to bile acids in
experimental animals,5 and ascorbic acid­
deficient guinea pigs frequently develop
cholesterol gallstones.6-9 Because of the ex-
perimental animal evidence and the ob-
servation that many risk factors for gall-
bladder disease areassociatedwithascorbic
acid status, we hypothesized that ascor-
bic acid status may be a risk factor for hu-
man gallbladder disease.10
To ascertain whether ascorbic acid
status is associated with gallbladder dis-
ease in humans, and particularly with the
presence of asymptomatic gallstones, we
analyzed data collected from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) that included se-
rum ascorbic acid levels and information
on gallbladder disease among more than
13 000 American adults.
RESULTS
The baseline characteristics of 7042
women and 6088 men, aged 20 to 90
years, enrolled in NHANES III with

women (11%) and 235 men (4%)
reported a history of clinical gallbladder
disease. Among 9650 participants who

gallbladder disease nor a history of typi-
cal epigastric or right-upper-quadrant
abdominal pain lasting 1 hour or more,
408 (8%) of 4863 women and 274 (6%)

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
The NHANES III was a national probability survey of
approximately 40 000 Americans conducted between
1988 and 1994 that used a stratified, cluster sampling
design to oversample populations of special interest.11
Participants, aged 2 months to older than 90 years, were
enrolled, interviewed, and examined by study person-
nel.11 Complete data from 7042 women and 6088 men
between the ages of 20 and 90 years were available for
these analyses, representing approximately 83% of the
total number of examined participants. The NHANES III
recorded subjects older than 90 years as being 90 years
old. Participants were excluded if there were missing
data on variables judged to be potential predictors of
gallbladder disease or if outcome data on gallbladder dis-
ease were unavailable. We also excluded as potentially
unreliable historians an additional 4 participants who
reported consuming more than 30 alcoholic beverages
daily. Finally, 21 participants with extremely high serum
ascorbic acid levels (170 µmol/L) were excluded
because such values were of questionable validity.12 Par-
ticipants excluded because of missing data were com-
pared with those analyzed; both groups were similar
demographically regarding age and sex, but excluded
participants were more likely to have attained a lower
level of education and to be nonwhite.
MEASUREMENTS
The NHANES III questionnaire data included self-
reported age; race (categorized as white, black, or
other); sex; years of education completed; level of
leisure-time physical activity; history of smoking; diabe-
tes mellitus; level of alcohol intake; menopausal status;
use of diuretic, cholesterol-lowering, and estrogen-
containing medications; and dietary intake.11 Quantita-
tive nutrition data were collected by means of a 24-hour
dietary recall. We calculated body mass index (BMI; in
kilograms per meters squared) from weight and height
data recorded during the physical examination. The
questionnaires, dietary methods, and examination proce-
dures used in NHANES III have been described else-
where in detail.11
We ascertained whether participants had a history
of clinical gallbladder disease by a positive response to
either of the following questions: "Has a doctor ever told
you that you had gallstones?" and "Have you ever had
gallbladder surgery?"11 Both questions appeared twice in
the NHANES III questionnaire; we used the response to
the initial question for these analyses because of the
greater number of responses. Participants who had gall-
stones on abdominal ultrasound examination, but
reported no history of clinical gallbladder disease and
also denied a history of right-upper-quadrant or epigas-
tric abdominal pain lasting 1 hour or longer, were con-
sidered to have asymptomatic gallstones. Among the
13 130 participants in our sample, a real-time abdominal
ultrasound examination with valid results was per-
formed on 11 182 women and men aged 20 to 74 years
by means of a standard protocol.11 After exclusion of
participants with known clinical gallbladder disease
(n = 850) and with symptoms compatible with undiag-
nosed gallbladder disease (n = 682), there were 9650
participants available for the analysis of the relationship
of serum ascorbic acid level to asymptomatic gallstones.
Serum ascorbic acid and serum vitamin E (-
tocopherol) levels were measured at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga, by isocratic high-
performance liquid chromatography.13 Ascorbic acid levels
ranged from 0.0 µmol/L to the upper cutoff point of 170
µmol/L. Measurements of total and high-density lipopro-
tein cholesterol were performed by means of standardized
protocols.13
STATISTICAL METHODS
We examined the distribution of ascorbic acid levels and
other variables of interest using sample weights. We used
age-adjusted and multivariable logistic regression to
examine the associations of ascorbic acid level and other
variables to the prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease
and asymptomatic gallstones. Level of physical activity
was analyzed as an ordinal variable. Because we detected a
significant nonlinear relationship between age and gall-
bladder disease, and to improve the fit of the models, age
adjustment was performed with the use of linear and qua-
dratic terms for age. Multivariate models controlled for
the effects of age, race, level of education, physical activ-
ity, BMI, diabetes mellitus, use of diuretic and lipid-
lowering medications, cigarette smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, total serum cholesterol and high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels, serum vitamin E level, and
dietary intake of energy, fat, and fiber. For female partici-
pants, the multivariate models also controlled for the
effects of oral contraceptive use, estrogen replacement
therapy, history of pregnancy, number of live births, and
menopausal status. Variables included in the multivariate
models have been reported, in at least some studies, to be
associated with gallbladder disease.14 Serum vitamin E
was included in the multivariate models because it is an
important lipid-soluble antioxidant nutrient often corre-
lated with ascorbic acid intake. We tested for nonlinear
relationships by including both linear and quadratic terms
for serum ascorbic acid in the models.
Analyses were performed with Stata software that in-
cluded commands for the analysis of complex survey data.15
For each predictor variable, we calculated an odds ratio (OR)
and 95% confidence interval (CI). Because the probability
of clinical and asymptomatic gallbladder disease in NHANES
III is low, the ORs approximate the relative prevalence of
disease. We considered 2-tailed P values of less than .05 to
be statistically significant.
Figures examining the independent association
between serum ascorbic acid level and gallbladder dis-
ease outcomes plotted the predicted prevalence of clini-
cal gallbladder disease and asymptomatic gallstones as a
function of serum ascorbic acid level based on the multi-
variate models. For the figures, logistic coefficients were
used to compute individual predicted probability of each
outcome. These probabilities within each 0.06-µmol/L
serum ascorbic acid concentration were then smoothed
twice by means of a locally weighted symmetric nearest-
neighbor linear smoother16,17 that allows for the use of
sample weights.18,19

having used oral contraceptives, and 3% of both women
and men reported the current use of lipid-lowering
medications.
Among women, serum ascorbic acid level was
associated with prevalence of gallbladder disease. Age-
adjusted models demonstrated that serum ascorbic
acid levels were inversely associated with clinical and
asymptomatic gallbladder disease; each SD (27
µmol/L) increase in serum ascorbic acid level was
associated with an approximately 23% lower preva-
lence of clinical gallbladder disease and a 22% lower
prevalence of asymptomatic gallstones (both P.001).
Further adjustment for potential confounders includ-
ing race, BMI, diabetes, diet, menopausal status, use of
estrogen-containing and lipid-lowering medications,
and other variables attenuated these associations; an
SD increase in serum ascorbic acid levels was indepen-
dently associated with an approximately 13% lower
prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .006)
and asymptomatic gallstones (P = .048) (Table 2,
Figure 1, and Figure 2). The serum ascorbic acid
percentiles for Figures 1 and 2 are presented in the fol-
lowing tabulation:

self-reported race was other than white or black pro-
duced virtually identical results.
We also analyzed the relationship of serum ascor-
bic acid, categorized by quartile, to prevalence of clini-
cal and asymptomatic gallbladder disease. When com-
pared with women in the lowest serum ascorbic acid
quartile, multivariate analyses showed that women in the
highest quartile had a lower prevalence of clinical gall-
bladder disease (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.84; P.01) and
asymptomatic gallstones (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45-1.01;
P = .06). In similar comparisons, men in the highest se-
rum ascorbic acid quartile, however, did not have a sig-
nificantly lower prevalence of either clinical gallbladder
disease (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.51-1.42; P = .53) or asymp-
tomatic gallstones (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.39-1.70; P = .58)
when compared with men in the lowest quartile.
We explored factors that might confound the rela-
tionship between serum ascorbic acid and gallbladder dis-
ease by examining the effect of potential confounders
when added singly to age-adjusted models. Among
women, BMI was the only variable that substantially af-
fected the OR estimates. Inclusion of BMI in the age-
adjusted models resulted in an approximately 8% attenu-
ation in the magnitude of the association of serum ascorbic
acid to clinical and asymptomatic gallbladder disease. For
example, a 1-SD increase in serum ascorbic acid level (27
µmol/L) was associated with a 23% lower prevalence of
clinical gallbladder disease before adjustment for BMI,
but only a 17% lower prevalence after adjustment (age-
adjusted OR, 0.77; age- and BMI-adjusted OR, 0.83; both
P.001). There were no variables that significantly con-
founded the relationship between serum ascorbic acid and
gallbladder disease among men.
We also examined the relationship of ascorbic acid
supplement use (or use of multiple vitamins containing
additional ascorbic acid) to gallbladder disease by sub-
stituting supplement use for serum ascorbic acid in the
multivariate models presented in Table 2. Among women,
supplement use was independently associated with a 34%
lower prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .02)
but was not associated with prevalence of asymptom-
aticgallstones(P = .86).Amongmen,ascorbicacidsupple-
ment use was associated with a trend toward a higher
prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease (P = .07), but
was not associated with asymptomatic gallstones (P = .54).
Smoking, which lowers serum ascorbic acid levels, was
also analyzed as a separate predictor of gallbladder dis-
ease. In analyses that excluded serum ascorbic acid, smok-
ing among women was nonsignificantly associated with
clinical gallbladder disease (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.87-
1.38; P = .43) and asymptomatic gallstones (OR, 1.29; 95%
CI, 0.89-1.87; P = .18).
Because ascorbic acid may have important effects on
the metabolism of alcohol, we examined whether alco-
hol consumption may modify the association between se-
rum ascorbic acid level and prevalence of gallbladder dis-
ease. We found no evidence of such an interaction.
COMMENT
Our principal finding was a consistent inverse relation-
ship between serum level of ascorbic acid and preva-
lence of gallbladder disease among women. We also ob-
served among women that ascorbic acid supplement use
was associated with a lower prevalence of clinical gall-
bladder disease. We found no significant relationship,
however, between serum level of ascorbic acid (or ascor-
bic acid supplement use) and prevalence of gallbladder
disease among men. Three reports have examined the re-
lationship of ascorbic acid to gallbladder disease among
human populations, and our findings are, in general, simi-
lar to those in these reports.20-22 In a small case-control
study among 23 men and 77 women, Ortega and col-
leagues20 found an association between lower dietary in-
take of ascorbic acid and gallbladder disease among
women, but not men. In another study, Simon et al21 ex-
amined ascorbic acid supplement use as a correlate of clini-
cal gallbladder disease among postmenopausal women
with coronary heart disease. Among women who con-
sumed alcohol, ascorbic acid supplement use was inde-
pendently associated with a 50% reduction in preva-
lence of self-reported gallstones and a 62% reduction in
cholecystectomy.21 This study, however, examined a
somewhat atypical group of women with a high (23%)
prevalence of self-reported gallbladder disease. Further-

more, this study was limited by lack of data on dietary
ascorbic acid intake or blood ascorbic acid levels. We
also analyzed data from the Second National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey and reported a signifi-
cant nonlinear relationship between serum ascorbic
acid level and prevalence of clinical gallbladder disease
among women; self-reported prevalence of gallstones
and cholecystectomy was lower among women with
both low and high serum levels of ascorbic acid.22 We
found no relationship, either linear or nonlinear,
between serum ascorbic acid level and gallbladder dis-
ease prevalence among men enrolled in the Second
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Thus, the association between ascorbic acid status and
gallbladder disease has been reported only among
women20-22 and may be the result of a biological interac-
tion between ascorbic acid status and sex. However,
these findings may also reflect the lower prevalence of
gallbladder disease among men and reduced statistical
power to detect such an association.
Unlike the previous studies examining the relation-
ship of ascorbic acid status to gallbladder disease,
NHANES III collected data on the sonographic pres-
ence of gallstones. These data are important because pre-
vious studies could not exclude the possibility that par-
ticipants changed their diets after being diagnosed as
having gallbladder disease. Although it seems implau-
sible that women with gallbladder disease would change
their diets and consume less ascorbic acid­containing
fruits, vegetables, and dietary supplements, this possi-
bility cannot be excluded. However, because this study
also examined participants with gallstones present on ab-
dominal ultrasound who denied any previous symptom-
atic gallbladder disease and reported no history of ab-
dominal pain consistent with undiagnosed gallbladder
disease, it strengthens the hypothesis that ascorbic acid
status may be an important risk factor for gallstone for-
mation among women.
We hypothesized that an inverse relationship
between serum ascorbic acid levels and gallbladder
disease in humans might be observed on the basis of
the results of animal experiments.10 In guinea pigs,
ascorbic acid affects the activity of cholesterol 7
-hydroxylase, the enzyme that regulates the rate-
limiting step in the catabolism of cholesterol to bile
acids.12 Ascorbic acid supplementation increases cho-
lesterol 7 -hydroxylase activity by as much as 15-fold
compared with ascorbic acid­deficient guinea pigs,23
and ascorbic acid­deficient guinea pigs frequently
develop cholesterol gallstones.7,8,24 Additionally, hy-
persecretion of mucin, a glycoprotein that is secreted
by the epithelium of the gallbladder, has been found to
precede cholesterol destabilization and gallstone for-
mation.25,26 Because hydroxyl and oxygen radicals
stimulate the hypersecretion of mucin,27 the inhibition
of oxidative changes within the gallbladder by ascorbic
acid may also decrease mucoprotein production and
gallstone formation.
Our study has a number of strengths and limita-
tions. Because NHANES III surveyed a large probability
sample of Americans, our findings, which are derived from
analyses of data from approximately 83% of examined
NHANES III participants, should be generalizable to the
US population. Although participants excluded from the
analyses were similar to included participants in regard
to age and sex, they were more likely to be nonwhite
and to have achieved a lower level of education. Nev-
ertheless, we believe these differences are unlikely to
substantially affect the generalizability of our findings.
Furthermore, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid
levels on a large sample of the population allows a
more reliable assessment of ascorbic acid status as a
correlate of gallbladder disease compared with studies
using dietary intake estimations only. Plasma ascorbic
acid levels are strongly correlated with leukocyte
ascorbic acid levels, an indicator of tissue levels,28 and
reflect at least the previous several months of dietary
intake, even during periods of seasonal variation.29 It
is also unlikely that recall bias affected our findings,
since participants obtained blood levels of ascorbic
acid and completed a comprehensive questionnaire
that included information on many health outcomes.
Most importantly, we have data on asymptomatic gall-
bladder disease that are not subject to interviewer or
recall bias and are not available from previous studies.
However, for the outcome of clinical gallbladder dis-
ease, we relied on self-reported history and may,
therefore, have misclassified some outcomes. Such
misclassification would likely have decreased the
power of our study to detect associations. It is also
possible that unknown or unmeasured confounders
may have affected our results and that serum ascorbic
acid may simply be a healthy lifestyle marker. Further-
more, we cannot exclude the possibility that a sys-
temic oxidative stress may both lower serum ascorbic
acid levels and result in gallstone formation. Finally,
because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we
cannot be certain that differences in serum ascorbic
acid level preceded gallbladder disease, and inferences
regarding causality should be made cautiously.
Serum ascorbic acid level is an important correlate
of symptomatic and asymptomatic gallbladder disease
among American women. Our study is the first to re-
port an association between serum ascorbic acid levels
and asymptomatic gallstones. Examination of this rela-
tionship among other populations is indicated, and clini-
cal trials of ascorbic acid for the primary or secondary
prevention of gallbladder disease among women should
be considered.
