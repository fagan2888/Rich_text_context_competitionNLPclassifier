SINCE the 1980s, rates of functional limitations and dis-
abilities have declined among older adults (Crimmins &
Saito, 2001; Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002; Manton
& Gu, 2001), and self-reported health has improved as well
(Martin, Schoeni, Freedman, & Andreski, 2007; Soldo,
Mitchell, Tfaily, & McCabe, 2006). Although reports of
these trends have painted an increasingly optimistic picture
of health at older ages, research also demonstrates that not
all older adults are postponing significant morbidity and
disability. Indeed, people with lower socioeconomic status
(SES) have worse health in all adult age groups, including
at older ages (House et al., 1994; House, Lantz, & Herd,
2005). Research reports and media attention that summa-
rize only overall or mean trends in improved health among
older adults mask important SES disparities in health that
persist at older ages.
Although research has documented socioeconomic
disparities in various measures of morbidity and mortal-
ity, there has been little attention paid to the socioeco-
nomic stratification of health-related quality of life
(HRQoL). However, "preference-based" HRQoL mea-
sures are increasingly used in both clinical studies and
cost-effectiveness studies, nationally and internationally,
though they have only recently appeared in population-
based studies that examine health disparities in the
United States (Fryback et al., 2007). Preference-based
HRQoL measures were originally created to measure
overall health states and were weighted by an average com-
munity or societal valuation of how good or bad it would
be to have given health states. If there is great socioeco-
nomic stratification in HRQoL, as there is with other
measures of morbidity and mortality, it would suggest
that future research on HRQoL in clinical, cost-effec-
tiveness, and population studies should attend to not only
examining mean levels of HRQoL but also disparities in
HRQoL.
The current study uses a recent, large national data set to
describe how SES is related to HRQoL and how this rela-
tionship varies by age among U.S. adults. This study ex-
tends prior work in a number of ways. First, the data were
collected in 2005/2006, allowing us to examine SES and
age variations in HRQoL using current data. Second, we
use three SES measures (income, education, and assets) to
examine how patterns vary by each of these measures

Objectives. We examine whether multiple health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures are stratified by socioeco-
nomic status (SES) and age in the United States.
Methods. Data are from the 2005/2006 National Health Measurement Study, a telephone survey of a nationally repre-
sentative sample of U.S. adults. We plot mean HRQoL scores by SES within age groups. Regression analyses test whether
education, income, and assets each have independent associations with three "preference-based" HRQoL measures and
self-rated health (SRH). We test whether these associations vary by age.
Results. There are SES disparities in HRQoL and SRH among adults in the United States at all age groups. Income
differentials in HRQoL are strong across current adult age cohorts, except the 75­89 age cohort. Education and assets
have statistically significant but weaker associations with HRQoL. All three SES measures are associated with SRH (net
of each other) at every age group. Those in the lowest income and education groups in the 35­44 age cohort have worse
HRQoL and SRH than those in higher SES groups in the 65+ age cohort.
Discussion. Significant improvements in HRQoL at the population level will only be possible if we improve the
HRQoL of people at the lowest end of the socioeconomic distribution.

separately and simultaneously. Third, we include three
preference-based HRQoL measures, along with the
commonly used self-rated health (SRH) item, to examine
similarities and differences in patterns of stratification
across these measures.
Background
Stratification of Health by SES and Age
Our research is informed by social stratification and life
course theories. One contemporary social stratification the-
ory, the "fundamental cause theory" (Link & Phelan, 1995),
aims to address why there are strong, consistent associa-
tions between SES and health in the United States (Adler &
Rehkopf, 2008), why these associations persist across time
and measure, and why these associations persist despite at-
tempts to improve health in the United States. Fundamental
cause theory suggests that SES shapes exposures to a vari-
ety of psychosocial and material conditions that more
directly impact health (House et al., 2005; Link & Phelan).
This theory emphasizes, however, that SES-related re-
sources, such as knowledge, money, power, and prestige,
are flexible resources that allow people to avoid risks and
adopt protective strategies no matter which psychosocial
and material risk and protective factors are closely aligned
with health at a given time (House et al., 2005; Link &
Phelan). Therefore, addressing the particular risk and pro-
tective factors that currently link SES to health will not
eliminate the association between SES and health because
those at the top of the socioeconomic hierarchy will find
new ways to use their flexible resources to gain advantages
that result in better relative health status.
Life course theories have been combined with social strat-
ification theories in a variety of ways to conceptualize how
relationships between SES and health vary, change, and ac-
cumulate over time. Cumulative advantage/disadvantage hy-
potheses would predict that we should see larger SES
disparities in health at older than at younger ages. Consistent
with a fundamental cause theory, this hypothesis suggests
that experiences of advantage/disadvantage shape both short-
and long-term health, and the accumulation of advantage/
disadvantage over the life course ultimately leads to increas-
ing heterogeneity at older ages (Dannefer, 2003; Hatch,
2005; Lauderdale, 2001; O'Rand, 1996; Ross & Wu, 1996).
In contrast, the "age-as-leveler" hypothesis suggests that
the relationship between SES and health should look smaller
at older ages. This hypothesis reflects a number of both
theoretically and methodologically based ideas. From a
theoretical standpoint, House and colleagues (1994) de-
scribe a theory of social stratification of aging and health
that posits that social and biological factors affect both ex-
posure to and impact of material and psychosocial condi-
tions over the life course. Consistent with a fundamental
cause theory, socioeconomic differences in exposure to risk
factors may increase through adulthood and accumulate to
affect health particularly through middle and older ages.
However, in later older ages, biological frailty may become
strong enough to level the playing field. Age-associated bio-
logical frailty may make older adults particularly vulnerable
to exposure to risk factors, reducing socioeconomic differ-
entiation in health in later old age. Data consistent with the
age-as-leveler hypothesis show that SES disparities in health
are smallest at younger ages, widest at middle and early
older ages, and smaller again at later old ages in national
surveys conducted in the mid 1980s (Deaton & Paxson,
1998; House et al., 1994, 2005; Robert & House, 1996).
In a recent study, Dupre (2007) combined the cumulative
advantage/disadvantage hypothesis and the age-as-leveler
hypothesis, suggesting that they are not contradictory. Al-
though cumulative advantage/disadvantage processes on an
individual level produce disparate onset and survival over
time, this individual process ultimately results in aggregate-
level findings of smaller SES disparities in health at later
old ages. Accumulated disadvantage over the life course
produces selective mortality, leaving many robust low SES
survivors in the population at later old ages. The age-as-
leveler phenomenon also may be partly due to improved
social, economic, and health policies at older ages that buf-
fer the effects of low SES on health (House et al., 2005).
Moreover, methodological explanations may contribute to
the age-as-leveler phenomenon because of weak measure-
ment of SES and health (Robert & House, 1996) or the ex-
clusion of nursing home residents from surveys, which
essentially exclude the sickest and lowest SES older adults.
Understanding the relationships between SES and health
over the life course is further complicated by the fact that
different dimensions of SES are theorized to affect health in
both overlapping and separate ways and at different points in
the life course (Luo & Waite, 2005). In adulthood, one's own
education and income are theorized to have both joint and
separate effects on health. Although one of the pathways
linking education to health is through its impact on income,
education also has independent effects on health through
shaping knowledge of health behaviors, sense of control, and
greater preferences for health (Grossman, 1972; Ross & Wu,
1996). Education may be most important in affecting the on-
set of disease and disability (Herd, Goesling, & House, 2007;
House et al., 2005; Melzer, Izmirlian, Leveille, & Guralnik,
2001; Ross &Wu, 1996), whereas income may most strongly
affect the progression of disease (Feinglass et al., 2007; Herd
et al., 2007; House et al., 2005).
Most U.S. research examines income and education as
separate measures of SES but does not address wealth
(Pollack et al., 2007), despite the potential importance of
wealth to health (Baum, 2007; Pollack et al., 2007), and
evidence that it may be strongly associated with health
among older adults (Robert & House, 1996). Indeed,
wealth may be a good marker for cumulative advantage
over the life course. People making it into older age with
high levels of wealth likely had (a) a trajectory of financial

accumulation positively associated with health throughout
adulthood and (b) no major health or economic shock that
significantly depleted assets (Kim & Lee, 2006; Lee &
Kim, 2003).
The current study describes associations among multiple
measures of SES and HRQoL and examines how these rela-
tionships vary by age group in the United States. From a fun-
damental causes perspective, we expect to see that multiple
measures of SES are associated with HRQoL, just as they
have been shown to be associated with unidimensional mea-
sures of health. We also expect that SES will be associated
with HRQoL at all ages but that the size of this association
may vary by age. Although we do not have the longitudinal
data to test cumulative advantage/disadvantage versus age-
as-leveler hypotheses, we will examine whether there is more
support for one hypothesis over the other. Prior research has
not looked at how preference-based HRQoL measures are
stratified by both age and SES in the United States, so it is
important to see if these patterns look similar or different
from patterns noted using unidimensional health measures.
Most of the social gerontology literature, and indeed
most of the research on social stratification and health in the
United States more generally, have not used multidimen-
sional measures of health (Alwin & Wray, 2005), let alone
preference-based HRQoL measures. Therefore, one goal of
this study is to more generally introduce preference-based
HRQoL measures to a readership that has not extensively
employed these measures. We believe that social gerontolo-
gists need to contribute to important discourse over strengths
and weaknesses of employing preference-based HRQoL
measures in future clinical, cost-effectiveness, and popula-
tion-based studies. Therefore, we first provide a general in-
troduction to preference-based HRQoL measures before
describing our study.
Background of Preference-Based HRQoL Measures
Health is a complex concept to define and measure. Al-
though there are various separate measures of disease states
and disability, HRQoL measures were originally established
to quantify overall health by combining observations of
various domains of health (e.g., pain, physical function, so-
cial function, and mental health) into one summary index.
However, this is a difficult task, as it is hard to determine
how to weight different health domains in relation to each
other because individuals have different preferences regard-
ing trade-offs among health domains. For example, who
should be considered worse off--someone with a functional
disability and significant pain or someone with depression
and inability to perform social roles? Therefore, preference-
based HRQoL measures were originally created to go
beyond existing HRQoL measures. Preference-based
HRQoL measures not only capture multiple domains of
health, but also take the next step to combine them in an
index that weights more heavily some domains over others,
as measured by community or societal valuation of health
domain trade-offs.
Creating preference-based HRQoL measures is a three-
step process (Feeny et al., 2002; Fryback et al., 2007). First,
data are gathered to identify important functional (e.g.,
physical function, mobility, social function) and experien-
tial (e.g., pain) domains and to create categorical scales for
each domain ranging from extremely bad health to full
health. A specific combination of one level from each mea-
sured domain defines a health state. The second step is to
create a scoring system for health states such that full or
perfect health is scored at 1.0, and states judged equivalent
to being dead are scored at 0.0. This is done by having a
representative sample of people evaluate and rate a selected
set of unique health states and then using econometric mod-
els to derive a scoring function that represents the sample's
average valuations of these health states. Once this scoring
function is established, the third step is to collect data from
individuals to determine their health states and then to as-
sign them each a preference-based HRQoL score that
weights their health states by the scoring function. Prefer-
ence-based HRQoL measures provide a summary score an-
chored at 0 (as bad as being dead) and 1 (perfect health)
(Feeny et al.; Fryback et al.).
One strength of preference-based HRQoL measures is
that they can be used both in clinical studies to track health
outcomes and in large, population-based surveys to track
trends in the HRQoL of populations. This includes the abil-
ity to track not just poor health but exceptionally good health
as well (Kaplan et al., 2008). Moreover, preference-based
HRQoL measures are the outcome measure of choice for
cost-effectiveness analyses in clinical and policy-based studies
(e.g., McHorney, 1999; Miller, Robinson, & Lawrence,
2006). Given their increased use, we need to understand
how HRQoL varies for subgroups of the population, such as
by age and SES.
In the United States, research has shown that preference-
based HRQoL scores are lower in older versus younger age
groups (e.g., Hanmer, Lawrence, Anderson, Kaplan, &
Fryback, 2006; Lubetkin, Jia, Franks, & Gold, 2005). Re-
search also shows that higher SES is associated with higher
HRQoL in the United States (Lubetkin et al.). However, we
know of no population-based U.S. research that has exam-
ined the stratification of HRQoL by both SES and age. In
one Canadian study, education, income, and occupation
were associated with one measure of HRQoL, and this as-
sociation was larger at late middle ages than at either younger
or older ages (Roberge, Berthelot, & Wolfson, 1995). We
extend this work by using a national rather than regional
sample, a U.S. sample, and multiple measures of HRQoL.
Our study examines age variations in the relationships
among multiple measures of SES and three commonly
used preference-based HRQoL measures: the SF-6D
(Brazier, Roberts, & Deverill, 2002), the European Qual-
ity of Life (EuroQol) 5-domain survey (EQ-5D) (Johnson,
SES AND AGE VARIATIONS IN HRQoL 381
Luo, Shaw, Kind, & Coons, 2005; Kind, 2007), and the
Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI3) (Feeny et al., 2002;
Horsman, Furlong, Feeny, & Torrance, 2003). Although
the three preference-based HRQoL indexes are each de-
signed to measure the value of a given health state, re-
search has found that these measures vary somewhat in
the same population (Fryback et al., 2007). Therefore, we
use and compare three measures of preference-based
HRQoL as well as the traditional SRH item (Idler, Rus-
sell, & Davis, 2000) so that (a) we can examine consis-
tency of patterns and (b) our results can be compared with
future research using other data sets that may have only
one of these measures.
Study Aims
Our first aim is to examine whether multiple HRQoL
measures are stratified by SES among adults in the United
States. We also examine whether the relationship between
SES and HRQoL varies by measure of SES and whether
multiple measures of SES each contribute independently to
explaining variation in HRQoL. Our second aim is to exam-
ine whether there are age variations in the relationship be-
tween SES and HRQoL and whether such patterns are
consistent with cumulative advantage/disadvantage versus
age-as-leveler hypotheses.
Methods
Data
Data are from the National Health Measurement Study, a
random-digit­dial telephone survey of a nationally repre-
sentative sample of 3,844 noninstitutionalized U.S. adults
in the 48 contiguous states, aged 35­89 years, with over-
samples of telephone exchanges with high percentages of Af-
rican Americans and of people older than 65 years (Fryback
et al., 2007). The survey was conducted between June 2005
and August 2006, with a simple response rate of 46%. SRH
was asked early in the survey, followed by randomly or-
dered questionnaire sets used to compute scores for differ-
ent preference-based HRQoL measures. Sampling weights
were computed based on the sample selection algorithm
and adjusted by poststratification to reflect the targeted 2000
Census population by age, gender, and race. We excluded
from analyses 181 respondents (4.7%) reporting their race
as neither White nor Black (people reporting Hispanic eth-
nicity were included if their race was reported as White or
Black). The weighted results are generalizable to the U.S.
noninstitutionalized adult population aged 35­89 years in
the 48 contiguous states for people reporting their race as
White or Black.
Measures
We categorize age groups as 35­44, 45­54, 55­64, 65­
74, and 75­89 years. Self-reported race is categorized as
either Caucasian/White (White) or Black/African American
(Black). Income reflects household income over the previ-
ous year and was grouped into four categories: <$20,000,
$20,000­34,999, $35,000­74,999, and $75,000 or more.
Education was grouped into four categories: less than high
school, high school graduate, some postsecondary educa-
tion, and a college degree or higher. Our measure of wealth
is referred to as household assets, measured by asking peo-
ple: "Suppose you needed money quickly, and you (and
your spouse) cashed in all of your checking and savings ac-
counts, any stocks and bonds, and real estate other than your
home. If you added up what you got, would this be . . . (pro-
vided dollar ranges)?" We coded household assets as
<$25,000, $25,000­99,999, and $100,000 or more. Al-
though this is a crude measure of assets, there are no addi-
tional wealth variables available, and we argue that having
some measure of wealth (or virtual lack of any wealth) is im-
portant to examine. Similar crude assets measures have dem-
onstrated associations with health in prior studies (Robert &
House, 1996), but we will be cautious about interpretations
using this measure. Table 1 describes the sample and inde-
pendent variables.
The EQ-5D is a widely used measure of HRQoL (Kind,
2007), particularly in Europe, but increasingly in the United
States (Johnson et al., 2005). The EQ-5D instrument in-
volves five questions about respondent's health today in five

domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain, and anx-
iety/depression, with each question having three possible
responses: no, moderate, and severe problem (Rabin &
de Charro, 2001). The unique combinations of these five
components define 243 health states, which were then trans-
formed to summary scores (ranging from -0.11 to 1.00) by
applying population-based preference weights created by
Shaw, Johnson, and Coons (2005) using a population sam-
ple of about 4,000 U.S. adults.
The SF-6D is a preference-based measure of HRQoL de-
rived from the proprietary SF-36v2TM, a widely used multi-
purpose health survey. The SF-6D comes from a subset of
11 of the 36 questions asked in the SF-36v2 (Brazier
et al., 2002). The SF-6D includes six domains (physical
function, role limitation, social function, pain, mental
health, and vitality), each having between four and six lev-
els, resulting in a total of 18,000 unique health states. The
scoring algorithm for the summary score comes from a U.K.
population sample, as distributed by the SF-36v2 vendor,
and ranges from 0.30 to 1.0.
The HUI3 is a preference-based HRQoL measure that
has been widely used as an outcome measure in clinical
studies and population health surveys and in economic eval-
uations (e.g., Feeny et al., 2002; Horsman et al., 2003). The
interviewer-administered version involves 40 questions re-
garding respondents' health over the last week in eight do-
mains: vision, hearing, speech, ambulation, dexterity,
emotion, cognition, and pain. Each domain has either five or
six levels, resulting in 972,000 unique health states. The
summary score was created using a scoring algorithm
(Feeny et al., 2002), including health states valued as worse
than dead (<0), ranging from -0.36 to 1.0.
The SRH question was phrased: "In general, would you
say your health is: Excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?" We use it as an ordinal scale ranging from 1 (poor
health) to 5 (excellent health). This measure has been in-
cluded in a number of large national surveys, and despite
this question's simplicity, it is usually a robust predictor of
later health outcomes (Idler et al., 2000), including disabil-
ity and mortality (Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Idler & Kasl,
1995; Kaplan, Berthelot, Feeny, McFarland, & Khan,
2007).
Analyses
In order to examine age variations in the relationship be-
tween SES and HRQoL, we first graphed mean values of
each of the HRQoL and SRH variables within SES and age
groups. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to
test SES differences in HRQoL and SRH scores, both for
the full sample and within each age group, with no control
variables. Analyses were performed using SAS System for
Windows (Version 9.1) procedures that incorporate survey
weights, PROC SURVEYMEANS and PROC SURVEYREG
(SAS Institute Inc., 2002­2003).
We conducted multivariate weighted least squares (WLS)
regressions to examine the associations between each SES
and HRQoL variable (and SRH), first net of gender, age,
and race and subsequently net of the other SES variables as
well. Partial F-tests were conducted to test whether each
SES variable significantly explained variation in HRQoL or
SRH. We also tested age-by-SES interaction terms, added
to the WLS models that included all the SES variables si-
multaneously (testing one interaction at a time).
There were missing data on seven items (percent missing
in parentheses): education (0.5%), income (8.3%), assets
(9.9%), EQ-5D (1.2%), SF-6D (3.0%), HUI3 (7.2%), and
SRH (0.5%). We therefore conducted multiple imputation,
creating five multiply imputed data sets. Results across the
five imputed data sets demonstrated little variation. The par-
tial F-tests and ANOVAs were performed with the first im-
puted data set. All other analyses were performed by
combining all five data sets via PROC MIANALYZE.
Results
HRQoL Stratification by SES
We first examine whether multiple measures of SES (in-
come, education, and assets) are separately and simultane-
ously associated with multiple measures of HRQoL and
SRH. Table 2 summarizes results of regressing each of the
three HRQoL and SRH measures on each of the SES mea-
sures separately, controlling for age, race, and gender. Table
2 demonstrates that each measure of SES is associated with
all HRQoL and SRH measures. At each lower level com-
pared with the highest level of education, income, and as-
sets, people report worse HRQoL and SRH. Partial F-tests
confirm that each SES measure significantly contributes to
explaining variance in every HRQoL and SRH measure.
In Table 3, we present results of regressing each HRQoL
and SRH measure on the three SES measures simultane-
ously, controlling for age, race, and gender. Partial F-tests
(not shown) indicated that each SES variable (each block of
SES dummy variables) is significantly associated with each
HRQoL and SRH measure (p<.05), while controlling for
gender, age, race, and other SES variables. This means that
although some of the coefficients representing pairwise
comparisons between the highest versus lower SES groups
are not statistically significant in Table 3, each overall mea-
sure of SES does contribute as a whole to HRQoL and SRH,
net of other SES variables.
Summarizing the results from Table 3 by SES measure
and focusing first on the three preference-based HRQoL
measures, we note that education has statistically signifi-
cant pairwise comparisons between lower and highest edu-
cation categories with two of the preference-based HRQoL
measures. In terms of the magnitude of the associations, us-
ing the cutoff of 0.03 as a coefficient size that is commonly
considered substantively important for preference-based
SES AND AGE VARIATIONS IN HRQoL 383
HRQoL measures (Lubetkin et al., 2005; Sullivan, Law-
rence, & Ghushchyan, 2005; Wyrwich et al., 2005), we find
that education has both statistically significant and substan-
tively important differences between lowest and highest
education categories predicting EQ-5D and HUI3 scores.
For example, those with less than a high school education
have an EQ-5D score that is 0.043 worse (on a scale of 0­1)
than those with a college degree or greater. Although those
with some post­high school education have worse EQ-5D
scores (-0.025) than those with a college degree, this coef-
ficient is statistically significant but not of sufficient magni-
tude (because the coefficient is <0.03) to be considered
substantively significant.
Income consistently shows statistically and substantively
significant associations with all three preference-based
HRQoL measures. Level of assets has only one substan-
tively significant association for the SF-6D when compar-
ing respondents with the lowest and highest asset levels.
Analyses regarding multicollinearity (not shown) suggest
that although the SES measures are related, there is not a
substantial multicollinearity problem with these additive
analyses.
We cannot directly compare the regression coefficients
for SRH (scaled from 1 to 5) with those for the three prefer-
ence-based HRQoL indexes because the scales differ nu-
mericallyandininterpretation.Thoseinthelowesteducation
group have, on average, a 0.60 worse SRH score (over one
half a category) than those in the highest education group.
Those in the lowest income group have a 0.64 worse SRH
score than those in the highest income group. Finally, those
with the lowest asset levels have a 0.35 lower SRH score
than those with the highest asset levels.
Among the SES variables, income has the strongest and
most consistent association with the HRQoL and SRH mea-
sures. Education makes modest additional contributions to
explaining variation in HRQoL, and the assets measure does
not consistently contribute much. However, all three SES
measures have independent associations with SRH. In sum,
these results demonstrate that all three SES measures have
independent associations with both HRQoL and SRH.
HRQoL Stratification by SES and Age
Our second aim is to examine whether there are age vari-
ations in the relationship between SES and HRQoL. We be-
gin by plotting simple means of the three HRQoL and SRH
measures within age groups and by SES categories. Figures
1­3 show the unadjusted means of the HRQoL and SRH
measures within age groups and by income, education, and
assets categories, respectively. The three preference-based
HRQoL indexes can be compared with each other, as they
have similar scales anchored at 0 and 1. Although the SRH
measure is not on the same metric, we can at least observe
similarities and differences in general patterns.
Figure 1 shows that income is associated with all mea-
sures of HRQoL and SRH. ANOVAs (not shown) confirm
that income has a statistically significant association (p<.05)
with all four HRQoL measures within each age group. Peo-
ple in the lowest income group (<$20,000) have worse
HRQoL than those with greater income at every age group.

In fact, those in the lowest income group have worse HRQoL
at ages 35­44 years than do those in the next highest income
group at ages 75­89 years. Income disparities appear wider
for the HUI3 measure than for either the SF-6D or EQ-5D.
Income disparities in SRH appear wide as well. Income dis-
parities appear widest at ages 45­54 years, and although
they are smaller at ages 75­89 years, they are still statisti-
cally significant at this age group. F-tests of age-by-income
interactions with no other controls (results not shown) con-
firm statistically significant (p<.01) age variations in the
associations between income and all three preference-based
HRQoL and SRH measures.
Figure 2 shows that education disparities in HRQoL and
SRH are fairly consistent across age groups (confirmed by
statistically nonsignificant [p>.05] age-by-education inter-
actions). Those with less than a high school education have
much worse HRQoL than those with higher levels of educa-
tion at all ages. ANOVAs (not shown) find that education
has a statistically significant association with all HRQoL
and SRH measures within each age group (p<.01). Again,
the HUI3 and SRH outcomes appear to reflect a greater gap
than do the SF-6D and EQ-5D.
Figure 3 shows that asset differentials in HRQoL are gen-
erally smaller at young adulthood (35­44), largest at ages
55­64 years, and smaller again at later old age (75­89). F-
tests of age-by-asset interactions were statistically signifi-
cant (p<.001) for all HRQoL and SRH measures, with no
other controls in the model. Despite the fact that the gap is
smaller at later old age, ANOVAs (not shown) confirm that
there are still asset disparities in HRQoL at each age
(p<.05), including at older ages (except at ages 35­44 years
with the HUI3). Of note is that the average HRQoL is
slightly higher at later old ages than at middle ages for the
groups with the lowest income and assets, which we address
in the Discussion section.
As results in Figures 1­3 do not adjust for other vari-
ables, we also performed WLS regressions including blocks
of age-by-SES interaction terms to the models in Table 3 to
examine whether age-by-SES interactions were statistically
significant once other SES variables were controlled. These
results (not shown) confirm that the association between
education and HRQoL and SRH does not vary by age group.
In addition, income disparities in HRQoL and SRH no lon-
ger vary by age group in multivariate models. There were
statistically significant interactions between age and assets
for both the SF-6D and HUI3 indicating that having
<$25,000 in assets is particularly associated with worse
SF-6D and HUI3 scores among those aged 45­54 and 55­
64 years, net of all other SES variables and race and gender.
In additional sensitivity analyses, age-specific analyses
were also conducted (not shown) and demonstrated general
consistency with the results reported here.

SES AND AGE VARIATIONS IN HRQoL 385
Discussion
Our study demonstrates that preference-based HRQoL
measures are significantly stratified by SES among U.S.
adults. Income, education, and assets are each associated
with multiple preference-based HRQoL measures and SRH,
with income being the strongest, most consistent predictor.
We also show that although there is some age variation in the
size of the relationship between SES and HRQoL, SES dis-
parities in HRQoL exist at all adult age groups--even at older
ages. In particular, we find that those at the bottom of the
socioeconomic distribution (with the lowest income, educa-
tion, and assets) have much worse HRQoL and SRH than
those with higher levels of SES. Indeed, those in the lowest
income and education groups currently have worse HRQoL
at ages 35­44 years than do those in the current 65+ age co-
hort in any of the higher income and education groups. Our
results of persisting SES disparities at older ages are consis-
tent with a recent Canadian prospective study that similarly
found strong income differences in older adults' ability to
maintain exceptional health over a 10-year follow-up period
(using the HUI3 HRQoL measure) (Kaplan et al., 2008).
One of the goals of our research was to introduce several
preference-based HRQoL measures to the literature on so-
cioeconomic and age stratification and health. Our results
are relatively consistent with previous work focusing on age
differences in SES disparities in unidimensional measures
of health. For example, our results show that income dif-
ferentials in HRQoL and SRH exist at all ages, but the wid-
est differentials are noted at about ages 45­54 years and the
smallest at later old age. These results are generally consis-
tent with research by House and colleagues (1994, 2005),
who found similar age patterns in the relationship between
income and functional health and chronic conditions in a
national study in the 1980s. Our multivariate results demon-
strated that among all SES variables, income is the strongest
predictor of HRQoL and SRH, with income strongly associ-
ated with HRQoL and SRH at all ages except at 75­89
years, net of other SES variables.
Our results indicated that education disparities in HRQoL
and SRH are fairly constant across all current age cohorts,
consistent with research demonstrating that education
matters to health throughout the life course (Lynch, 2006),
including at older ages (Martin et al., 2007; Schoeni,
Martin, Andreski, & Freedman, 2005). However, education
was a weaker predictor than income and indeed appeared
to be particularly weak at later old age (75­89 years). This

is consistent with research suggesting that education may
be more important earlier in life (affecting the onset of
disease), whereas income may be more important in later
life (affecting the progression of disease) (Herd et al., 2007;
House et al., 2005; Melzer et al., 2001; Ross &Wu, 1996).
Our results suggest that asset differentials in HRQoL exist
net of other measures of SES for some HRQoL measures,
particularly in middle age, consistent with previous research
focusing on specific measures of morbidity (Robert &
House, 1996). However, our measure of assets was crude
and likely underestimated asset effects--further research
should employ more detailed measures of wealth.
Our analyses were cross-sectional, and therefore we did
not aim to rigorously test cumulative advantage/disadvantage
versus age-as-leveler hypotheses. However, our results are
not consistent with a cumulative advantage/disadvantage hy-
pothesis. Because the relationship between SES and health is
generally much smaller at older ages in these data, our re-
sults are more consistent with an age-as-leveler hypothesis.
In fact, our bivariate figures showed that those with the low-
est income and asset levels actually had higher mean
HRQoL in the later old age cohort than did those in the
middle age cohorts. These results may be due to method-
ological issues (sampling and response bias), or they may
be real and due to either age or cohort effects and/or avail-
ability of Medicare-supported health care to those older
than 65 years.
As this research is based on a community sample, we do
not have data on people who are most likely to be the sick-
est--those in nursing homes or other institutions. Therefore,
it may be that our sample reflects the hardy survivors who
lived to older ages who are physically and mentally healthy
enough to participate in a phone survey. Indeed, Kaplan and
colleagues (2008) found that baseline income was strongly
linked to maintaining exceptionally good health more than
10 years among Canadian elders, particularly when these
"thrivers" were compared with older adults who were in
institutions after 10 years. Future U.S. research needs to ex-
amine the health of all older adults, no matter where they
reside, in order to fully understand age variations in health,
and particularly if we want to well test cumulative advan-
tage/disadvantage versus age-as-leveler hypotheses.

SES AND AGE VARIATIONS IN HRQoL 387
When comparing the results for the three preference-based
HRQoL measures with the single SRH measure, we found
that SRH appeared most strongly associated with or sensi-
tive to SES.Whereas the preference-based HRQoL measures
embody self-reported health status valued using community
preferences, SRH embodies self-reported health implicitly
valued by an individual's own rating. Perhaps lower SES
individuals experiencing poor health are more likely to eval-
uate this health state much lower than the valuation of the
general public. Our results suggest that this simple SRH
measure remains useful in research aimed at understanding
SES and health, particularly because it is much easier to
measure than the preference-based HRQoL measures. How-
ever, because the preference-based HRQoL measures may
increasingly be used in clinical, cost-effectiveness, and
population-based studies, gerontologists should contribute
to the discourse both over the use of these measures more
generally (whether or when they are appropriate/inappropri-
ate) and about the importance of examining their stratifica-
tion by SES and age when they are used.
For researchers interested primarily in HRQoL, our results
demonstrate whether and how social stratification by SES
and age needs to be considered in future research and pro-
vides estimates across three common HRQoL measures that
can be used for comparative purposes. Comparing the three
preference-based HRQoL measures, we note larger SES
disparities for the HUI3 than for the SF-6D and the EQ-5D
in both bivariate and multivariate analyses. The HUI3 indi-
cates much lower levels of HRQoL among those in the low-
est income group in particular. It might be that the HUI3 is
more able to discriminate among severe poor health states,
as it includes eight attributes with five or six levels each.
Alternately, it may be that these results reflect the fact that
the preference values assigned to the same poor health states
are given lower value weights in the HUI3. Future research
should examine whether the HUI3 indeed captures more nu-
anced aspects of poor health that are more likely to be seen
among low SES groups or whether differences in the as-
signed preference values are solely responsible for the dif-
ferent results. In any case, researchers with data without
multiple measures of HRQoL should be aware that the val-
ues for lower SES groups may differ by HRQoL measure.
Another limitation to this study is that we excluded 4.7%
of respondents reporting their race as neither White nor
Figure 3. Assets-by-age interactions for each health-related quality of life measure.

388
Black, meaning that our results are generalizable only to
U.S. community-residing adults who report their race as ei-
ther White or Black. Future research will need to examine
the relationship between race and HRQoL more closely, in-
cluding how it may vary by hard-to-reach racial subgroups
of the population. Strengths of this study include that we
use a recent national study on health among U.S. adults, us-
ing multiple preference-based measures of HRQoL and an
SRH measure, and examine three SES measures (education,
income, and assets). Our results provide an excellent basis
of comparison for future studies that have more limited data
on either SES or HRQoL measures.
In conclusion, given that people in the highest SES groups
already have very high HRQoL and SRH in all age groups,
we cannot expect overall mean population health to signifi-
cantly improve in the United States unless it improves for
people who currently have the lowest SES levels and the
lowest HRQoL and SRH. Moreover, although the overall
economic status of older adults has improved in recent de-
cades, it has not improved for all older adults. Our results
show that these SES disparities are associated with HRQoL
and SRH disparities among all adult age groups. Policy and
program efforts to improve population health might most
effectively focus on those at the bottom of the SES distribu-
tion. Although this might involve efforts to buffer the health
effects of having low SES, a fundamental cause theory
would suggest that a more efficient policy effort might be to
address educational attainment and income and asset secu-
rity directly rather than to temporarily buffer their effects.
