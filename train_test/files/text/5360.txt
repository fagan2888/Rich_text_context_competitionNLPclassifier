Abstract
Objective: This study evaluated the effects of vaginal and caesarean delivery on internal and
external anal sphincter muscle thickness using translabial ultrasonography (TL-US).
Methods: This prospective cohort study enrolled nulliparous women who either had vaginal or
caesarean deliveries. The thickness of the hypoechoic internal anal sphincter (IAS) and hyperechoic
external anal sphincter (EAS) at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions at the distal level were
measured before delivery and within 24­48 h after delivery.
Results: A total 105 consecutive women were enrolled in the study: 60 in the vaginal delivery
group and 45 in the caesarean delivery group. The IAS muscle thickness at the 12 o'clock position
in the vaginal delivery group was significantly thicker before compared with after delivery
(mean Æ SD: 2.31 Æ 0.74 mm versus 1.81 Æ 0.64 mm, respectively). The EAS muscle thickness at
the 12 o'clock position in the vaginal delivery group was significantly thicker before compared with
after delivery (mean Æ SD: 2.42 Æ 0.64 mm versus 1.97 Æ 0.85, respectively).
Conclusions: There was significant muscle thinning of both the IAS and EAS at the 12 o'clock
position after vaginal delivery, but not after caesarean delivery.

Introduction
Faecal incontinence, defined as involuntary
passage of stool or flatus, is a prevalent
condition, estimated to affect 3­10% of
women.1,2 Third- and fourth-degree perineal
lacerations during birth and instrumental
deliveries have been found to be associated
with an increased likelihood of faecal incon-
tinence in women.3,4
The protective effect of caesarean section
over uncomplicated vaginal delivery on faecal
incontinence has not been shown.1,5 In con-
trast, several studies have shown significantly
reduced squeezing pressure on anal manome-
try after vaginal delivery but not after
caesarean delivery.6,7 A common hypothesis
is that anal sphincter function would be better
preserved with caesarean delivery.
The use of ultrasonography for the char-
acterization of the anal sphincter complex
has been shown to be reliable and sensitive.8
Compared with endoanal ultrasonography,
translabial ultrasonography (TL-US) using
a vaginal probe is simple and accessible
in almost every obstetric unit. A transvagi-
nal probe was first used to evaluate the
anal sphincter in 1994;8 and the planes of the
anal sphincter were defined using a transva-
ginal probe in female patients in 2005.9
Although TL-US is used widely for the
detection of sphincter defects after birth,
the effect of the delivery method on the anal
sphincter immediately after birth has not
been studied.
This present study evaluated the effects of
vaginal and caesarean delivery on internal
and external anal sphincter measurements
using TL-US with a vaginal probe in nul-
liparous women.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This prospective cohort study enrolled con-
secutive healthy nulliparous women at term
pregnancy (gestational age of !37 weeks)
who attended the Labour Unit, Etlik
Zu
¨ beyde Hanim Women's Health Teaching
and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey
between August 2009 and December 2010
in order to give birth. Nulliparous women
who underwent caesarean section as a result
of obstetric or medical indications, without
entering active labour, were recruited to
the caesarean delivery group during the
same time period. The exclusion criteria
for the vaginal delivery group were:
(i) women who were delivered with vacuum
or forceps; (ii) women who developed third-
or fourth-degree lacerations during delivery;
(iii) women with sphincter interruption on
postpartum TL-US, with muscle interrup-
tion being defined as a complete discontinu-
ity in the muscle at a given location. The
following demographic and clinical charac-
teristics were recorded for each study par-
ticipant: maternal age, body mass index,
weight gain during pregnancy, gestational
age of baby and birth weight of baby.
The study was approved by the Local
Ethics Committee of Etlik Zu
¨ beyde Hanim
Women's Health Teaching and Research
Hospital (no. 06.07.09/174) and it conformed
to the Declaration of Helsinki. All women
were informed of the study's purpose and
protocol and each study participant provided
written informed consent.
Anal sphincter muscle thickness
measurements
The hypoechoic internal anal sphincter
(IAS) and hyperechoic external anal sphinc-
ter (EAS) thicknesses were measured at
the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock positions at the
distal level as described previously.9 The
anal sphincters were first measured prior to
delivery (prepartum): at the beginning of the
labour for the vaginal delivery group (with
cervical dilatation of 4 cm with regular
contractions or with rupture of the mem-
branes); and at the time of admission for
the caesarean delivery group (Figure 1).
The anal sphincter measurements were

repeated postpartum at 24­48 h after deliv-
ery for both groups (Figure 2).
Examinations were performed in the lith-
otomy position. A single operator (D.K.)
performed the TL-US examinations, both
prepartum and postpartum. Ultrasound was
performed using an GE LOGIQTM P5 ultra-
sound machine (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee,

vaginal probe. The vaginal probe was first
placed translabially to get a longitudinal view
of the anal canal. Then the transducer was
rotated 90 and an axial image of the distal
anal sphincters was obtained at the level of
the mucosal star sign.9 Measurements in the
transverse plane included: (i) IAS measure-
ments (hypoechoic part from side to side);
and (ii) EAS measurements (only circular
hyperechoic muscular fibres of the EAS from
side to side). The hammock-like muscle fibres
of the pubovisceral muscle were not included,
which could be seen passing posteriorly in
some patients at this level (Figure 1a & 1b).
Statistical analyses
Previous research and a prior pilot study
conducted in our clinic revealed a difference
of 0.5 mm with a standard deviation of 1.3,
which was the baseline hypothesis for the
difference between measurements before and
after delivery for each sphincter position.10
Using these values with a significance level of
P < 0.05, 95% confidence interval and 80%
power, the minimum sample size was calcu-
lated to be 42 for each group.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Categorical variables are pre-
sented as percentages and continuous
variables are presented as mean Æ SD. The
normality of the variables was tested using
the Kolmogorov­Smirnov test. For statis-
tical analysis, independent samples t-test
was used to compare the two groups.
Paired-samples t-test was used to compare
two sets of measurements prepartum and
postpartum. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 105 consecutive nulliparous
women with term pregnancy, 60 in the vagi-
nal delivery group and 45 in the caesarean
delivery group, were enrolled in the study. In
the vaginal delivery group, one woman who
experienced third- or fourth-degree lacer-
ations during delivery and seven women
with sphincter interruption on postpartum
TL-US were excluded from the analysis,
which left 52 patients in the vaginal delivery
group.
The demographic and clinical character-
istics of the two groups are presented in
Table 1. There were no significant differ-
ences between the vaginal and caesarean
delivery groups in terms of maternal age,
body mass index, weight gain during preg-
nancy, gestational age of the baby and birth
weight of the baby. All patients in the
vaginal delivery group had a mediolateral
episiotomy.

Discussion
Faecal incontinence has been shown to be
related to occult sphincter injury during
birth.6,11,12 In addition to anal sphincter
interruption, attenuation of both the inter-
nal or external sphincter may have a nega-
tive impact on sphincter function.13 This
study demonstrated that in the vaginal
delivery group, both the internal and exter-
nal sphincter muscles were thinner at the
anterior region (12 o'clock position) after
delivery compared with before the delivery.
The present study did not detect any differ-
ences between the measurements of both the
internal and external sphincter muscle thick-
nesses taken before and after caesarean
delivery.
This is the first study to examine the anal
sphincter before delivery and then again
within 24­48 h after delivery. This present
study undertook TL-US imaging before and
after delivery in vaginal and caesarean
delivery groups in order to be able to
compare the impact of delivery type on
anal sphincter anatomy. Normal muscle
thickness values for anal sphincters at the
end of pregnancy and immediately after
delivery are lacking. The IAS muscle thick-
ness ranged from 1.81 to 2.40 mm after
vaginal delivery and from 2.14 to 2.52 mm
after caesarean delivery. The EAS muscle
thickness ranged from 1.97 mm to 3.06 mm
after vaginal delivery and from 2.23 to
3.02 mm after caesarean delivery.
Previous research has waited at least
6 weeks after birth before measuring anal
sphincter muscles,6 but this present study
aimed to detect occult sphincter injury early
and exclude these women before healing had
been accomplished. However, the present
results may have been affected by early
inflammation secondary to delivery. A pre-
vious study evaluated normal TL-US anal
sphincter complex measurements of women
at 6 months after both vaginal and caesar-
ean deliveries.10 The study showed that IAS
measurements at the 12 o'clock position,
both proximally and distally, were signifi-
cantly thicker for caesarean delivery patients
compared with vaginal delivery patients.10
The present IES data were found to be
similar to previously published values,9,10,14
but the EAS measurements were thinner
than previous measurements made in both
prepartum and postpartum patients.10,14
For example, the EAS thickness measure-
ments ranged from 5.6 to 6.6 mm in preg-
nant women examined using endoanal
utrasonography.14 The difference in EAS
thickness between studies probably depends
on the imaging technique used, because the
method used in the present study only
measured the circular hyperechoic muscle
fibres of the EAS from side to side and it did
not include the hammock-like muscle fibres
of the pubovisceral muscle, which could be
seen passing posteriorly in some patients at
this level. The present EAS thickness values
were similar to those previously measured
using magnetic resonance imaging.15
The anal sphincter is composed of an
involuntary inner smooth-muscle compo-
nent (the internal anal sphincter) and a
voluntary striated muscle component (the
external anal sphincter). The most common
cause of sphincter damage is vaginal deliv-
ery,2,4 therefore most of the patients who
need anal sphincter investigations are
women. Endoanal ultrasound is currently
the gold standard for sphincter evaluation,
but vaginal ultrasound has many advan-
tages in women.16 The use of transvaginal
ultrasound probes is available in almost
every obstetrics and gynaecology unit and
physicians are familiar and experienced with
the vaginal approach. The anus is undis-
turbed by the insertion of a vaginal probe, so
examination of the anal sphincters can be
Karcaaltincaba et al. 829
done without deformity from a probe within
the canal. This allows the thickness of the
internal sphincter and the subepithelial tis-
sues to be measured in their true resting
state. The internal sphincter has been found
to be a little thicker when a vaginal probe is
used rather than when it is measured using
endoanal ultrasonography.8 Although
doubts have been raised about the ability
of transvaginal scanning to accurately detect
sphincter damage, results of both prospect-
ive and retrospective studies support the use
of transvaginal ultrasonography as a reliable
method for evaluating the anal sphincter,
equivalent in accuracy to the endoanal
technique.9,17,18
Proximal thinning after vaginal birth can
be defined as sphincter asymmetry and it
may be a sign of partial damage. However, it
has been suggested that sphincter thinning
or asymmetry, particularly at the 12 o'clock
position, is not a product of birth injury or
the mode of delivery.19 Even though the
anterior (12 o'clock position) sphincter
muscles were thinner compared with the
other three positions before delivery in the
present study, further significant sphincter
thinning of both the IAS and EAS at the 12
o'clock position after delivery was only seen
in the vaginal delivery group. One of the key
benefits of the present study was the fact that
the same patients were scanned before and
after delivery.
In the vaginal delivery group (n ¼ 60) in
the present study, one woman (1.7%)
experienced third- or fourth-degree lacer-
ations during delivery and seven women
(11.7%) experienced occult sphincter inter-
ruption as detected on postpartum TL-US.
These eight women were excluded from
these analyses. There are very conflicting
results in the literature regarding the detec-
tion rate of postpartum occult sphincter
injury as measured by ultrasonography.20,21
A previous study reported that 28% (42 of
150) of nulliparous women were diagnosed
as having occult sphincter tears as measured
by anal endosonography immediately after
vaginal birth,11 but a subsequent study by
the same authors reported a lower rate of
5.6% (21 of 376).12
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, the study included only nul-
liparous women. This may have increased
the need for episiotomy during delivery and
the potential effect of episiotomy on anal
sphincter measurements after delivery has
not been eliminated. However, the presence
of a significant difference only at the
12 o'clock position was similar to a previous
study performed after 6 months of deliv-
ery,10 which suggests that the effect of
episiotomy may have been negligible.
Secondly, this study used 2D ultrasonog-
raphy to measure only the distal IAS and
EAS. Larger studies that use 3D ultrason-
ography to evaluate multiple planes of the
anal sphincter are recommended.
In conclusion, this present study demon-
strated significant muscle thinning of both
the IAS and EAS at the 12 o'clock position
after vaginal delivery, but not after caesar-
ean delivery, as determined by TL-US.
These findings may show that the anal
sphincter is better preserved during caesar-
ean delivery compared with vaginal delivery.
