ABSTRACT
Objective: To explore how sexual and marital trajectories
are associated with HIV infection among ever-married
women in rural Malawi.
Methods: Retrospective survey data and HIV biomarker
data for 926 ever-married women interviewed in the
Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project were
used. The associations between HIV infection and four key
life course transitions considered individually (age at
sexual debut, premarital sexual activity, entry into
marriage and marital disruption by divorce or death) were
examined. These transitions were then sequenced to
construct trajectories that represent the variety of
patterns in the data. The association between different
trajectories and HIV prevalence was examined, controlling
for potentially confounding factors such as age and
region.
Results: Although each life course transition taken in
isolation may be associated with HIV infection, their
combined effect appeared to be conditional on the
sequence in which they occurred. Although early sexual
debut, not marrying one's first sexual partner and having a
disrupted marriage each increased the likelihood of HIV
infection, their risk was not additive. Women who both
delayed sexual debut and did not marry their first partner
are, once married, more likely to experience marital
disruption and to be HIV-positive. Women who marry their
first partner but who have sex at a young age, however,
are also at considerable risk.
Conclusions: These findings identify the potential of a
life course perspective for understanding why some
women become infected with HIV and others do not, as
well as the differentials in HIV prevalence that originate
from the sequence of sexual and marital transitions in
one's life. The analysis suggests, however, the need for
further data collection to permit a better examination of
the mechanisms that account for variations in life course
trajectories and thus in lifetime probabilities of HIV
infection.
With the development of life course epidemiology1
and sequence analysis in demographic research,2
increasing attention has been given to the impact
of early life experiences on adult health. This
approach has the potential to be useful for study-
ing the AIDS epidemic because the temporal
ordering and timing of individuals' sexual and
marital partnerships may be quite relevant for
one's lifetime risk of contracting a sexually
transmitted infection.3
Most previous research has focused on the
relationship between a single transition and HIV
infection. Several studies have shown, for example,
that early sexual debut is associated with an
increased likelihood of HIV infection.4­6 The time
between first sex and first marriage, as well as the
number of premarital sexual partners, are also both
believed to increase the HIV risk substantially.3 7
The transition into marriage itself influences HIV
risks: women who marry before the age of 20 are
more likely to be HIV-positive than unmarried
women of the same age, both because marriage
typically coincides with a dramatic increase in the
frequency of sexual activity and because husbands
are generally older than boyfriends and thus have
had more opportunity to become infected them-
selves.8 9 Marriage duration may either offer
protection or exacerbate the HIV risk. If both
spouses enter the marriage HIV-negative and
remain sexually exclusive, marriage affords con-
siderable protection. If, however, either spouse is
already infected or is subsequently unfaithful and
condom use within marriage is low, frequent
unprotected sex with a spouse increases the like-
lihood of HIV transmission.8­13 Finally, transitions
out of marriage via divorce or widowhood are
strongly associated with HIV status.14 15 The causal
direction of this association may be difficult to
disentangle, however. For example, divorce may be
provoked by suspicion of infidelity and death may
be due to AIDS. Alternatively, those who are
divorced or widowed may subsequently become
infected in a later sexual relationship.
While previous research indicates that each of
these life transitions and stages taken alone has
important implications for HIV risks, life course
theory emphasises that they are not independent
of one another. The timing of sexual debut, for
instance, marks a critical transition to adulthood
that has a significant impact on future patterns of
marital and non-marital relationships.16­18
Moreover, when and to whom individuals marry
have a strong influence on whether or not the
marriage endures. Thus, it might be fruitful to
examine the relation between HIV infection and
the sequence of one's sexual and marital life
transitions--that is, an individual sexual and
marital trajectory. Analyses of the association
between HIV infection and life course trajectories
have, to our knowledge, not previously been
conducted because they require detailed socio-
demographic and serological panel data as well as
sophisticated modelling techniques. In this paper
we take a first step towards such analyses by
constructing sexual and marital trajectories for 926
ever-married women in rural Malawi, and by
then examining the association between these
trajectories and the HIV status of the women.
Although the nature of our data does not permit

identification of specific causal pathways between sexual and
marital trajectories and HIV infection, we are able to distinguish
trajectories associated with a high HIV prevalence from those
associated with a low HIV prevalence.
METHODS
Data and study population
The data for this study are taken from the Malawi Diffusion
and Ideational Change Project (MDICP). Since 1998 the MDICP
has collected panel data from ever-married women and their
husbands to examine the role of social networks in changing
attitudes and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS, family size and
family planning in rural Malawi (details on sampling and field
work procedures, as well as the survey data, are available from
the MDICP website: http://malawi.pop.upenn.edu). In the
analyses that follow we use retrospectively reported data on
sexual and premarital histories collected during the second wave
of the MDICP in 2001, and on marital histories and HIV
serology data collected in the third wave in 2004 (for details, see
Bignami-Van Assche et al19).
In 2001, 1570 ever-married women completed the MDICP
survey; of these, 1217 (77.5%) were re-interviewed in 2004. The
majority of women who were lost to follow-up between 2001
and 2004 had moved (44.4%), were away temporarily (17.1%) or
had died between the two survey waves (10.2%). Yet attrition is
not likely to bias the estimates presented in this paper, as
illustrated in detail elsewhere.20 HIV serology data were not
collected in 2001, but HIV status measured from biomarker
testing is available for 1024 women (84.1%) who were re-
interviewed in 2004 (lack of information on HIV status is due
mainly to refusal to be tested for HIV). Of the women in this
latter group, 926 (90.4%) had complete survey information on
sexual and marital histories and thus represent the sample for
the present analysis.
Measurement and quality of key indicators
We focus on four key events in the lives of rural Malawian
women: sexual debut, premarital sexual activity, first marriage
and marital dissolution via divorce (including separations) and
widowhood.
Sexual debut was measured by the woman's self-reported age
at first sexual intercourse in the 2001 wave of the MDICP.
Although it is well known that sexual activity in surveys is
often underreported and/or misreported, reports about sexual
activity in the MDICP seem quite reliable.21 22
Women who reported that they did not marry their first
sexual partner were inferred to have had premarital sexual
activity (or premarital partners), although we have no informa-
tion on the number of their premarital partners.
Retrospective self-reported information on women's marital
histories (including marital disruptions via separation, divorce
or widowhood) was obtained from the 2004 wave of the
MDICP. While there are different definitions of marriage across
and within countries in sub-Saharan Africa, the MDICP relies
on respondents' self-reports of their status as married, regardless
of whether or not there had been a public marriage ceremony.
Thus, both formal and informal marriages were included.
Methods of analysis
Descriptive statistics for the characteristics and sexual and
marital histories of the selected women are presented and the
bivariate associations between HIV status and these character-
istics and behaviours are identified. The four key events of
interest (sexual debut, premarital sexual activity, marriage and
marital disruption) are then sequenced in order to construct
trajectories that represent the variety of patterns in our data. To
do so, we first divide the sampled women into two groups based
on their age at sexual debut (before or after age 15). Second, we
split each group into two subgroups according to whether the
woman married her first sexual partner or not. We split each
group a third time according to the outcome of the first
marriage: remained married to first spouse, became divorced or
separated from spouse or became widowed (women who
experienced both divorce and widowhood were placed in the
widowhood category). We then evaluate how HIV prevalence
differs across each life course event considered individually as
well as entire trajectories.
Finally, we examine the association between different
trajectories and HIV prevalence controlling for potentially
confounding factors such as age and region. The MDICP data
were collected in three regions of Malawi (South, Centre and
North) in which different religious and cultural practices are
prevalent; the regions have consistently been found to differ
substantially in sexual and marital patterns as well as in HIV
prevalence. Specifically, we use logistic regression to model HIV
status as a function of two sets of covariates. First, we examine
the role of each trajectory, controlling only for age and region.
Second, we add other salient characteristics of women's sexual
and marital histories: the age difference between the woman
and her first spouse; whether the woman or any of her spouses
had extramarital partnerships, both as reported by the woman;
whether the woman had been in at least one polygamous union
during her entire marriage history; and the woman's total
number of lifetime partners (both spousal and non-spousal).
Covariates are introduced in the model one set at a time.
Variables in the full model were selected by using a conditional
stepwise backward strategy in which the statistical criteria for
entry and retention of variables in each model are p(0.05 and
p(0.10, respectively. Results are presented as odds ratios (OR)
with 95% confidence interval (CI). All analyses were done with
SPSS Version 9 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA, 2008).
RESULTS
Characteristics of women's sexual and marital histories
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the respondents'
background characteristics and sexual and marital histories, for
the characteristics and behaviours of their sexual and marital
partners, and for the HIV prevalence associated with these
characteristics and behaviours.
Beginning with their premarital histories, 40.1% of women
reported that their sexual debut occurred before the age of
15 years, with the median age at first sexual intercourse being
16 years (not shown). About one-third (32.1%) of all women
reported not marrying their first sexual partner. In addition, half
of all women reported having had only one lifetime sexual
partner, 35.4% two partners, and 19.8% three or more partners.
With regard to the women's marital histories, the median age
at first marriage was 18 years (not shown). Most women
(88.9%) were still married in 2004, 6.4% were divorced or
separated and 4.8% were widowed. During their married life,
35.4% of women had been divorced at least once and 9.8% had
been widowed at least once. Approximately one-third (30.8%)
of all women said that their first husband had been more than
5 years older when they got married, although 13.3% did not
provide age difference information. Due to sampling strategies
described elsewhere,23 the number of women reporting having
ever been in a polygynous union was high at 50%. Extramarital

sexual activity was infrequently reported by women, but nearly
half said they knew that at least one of their husbands had had
extramarital partners while they were married.
Overall, the prevalence of HIV in 2004 for the women
included in the study was 9%. Differentials in HIV prevalence
by age were not statistically significant. As found in other
studies,24 differentials by region indicate a significantly higher
HIV prevalence in south Malawi (12.4%) than in north Malawi
(6.2%; p,0.05). Overall, women who had an early sexual debut
(that is, by age 15) had a higher HIV prevalence (11.1%) than
women who had a late sexual debut (7.6%), although the
difference was not highly significant (p,0.10). On the other
hand, whether sexual debut occurred with a spouse rather than
with another partner and the total number of lifetime partners
were significantly associated with a lower HIV prevalence.
Women who were still married in 2004 had a significantly lower
prevalence of HIV than women who had become widows (8.1%
vs. 9.0%) and, especially, than women who had got divorced
(15.3%; p,0.05). A history of divorce and/or widowhood was
one of the characteristics of women's marital histories most
significantly associated with a high prevalence of HIV. Finally,
of the other attributes of women's marital histories considered,

increased HIV prevalence.
Women's sexual and marital trajectories
Using information on sexual debut, premarital sexual activity,
marriage and marital dissolution, we identified the most
common sequences or trajectories (fig 1). It is evident that an
early sexual debut is associated with premarital partnerships;
slightly more than half (56.3%) of the women who initiated sex
at an early age reported not marrying their first sexual partner.
Although the combination of early sexual debut and premarital
sexual activity might be associated with greater marital
dissolution, this was not the case for the women in our sample.
Within the group of women who had an early sexual debut the
rates of marital dissolution were remarkably similar, whether
they did or did not marry their first sexual partner.
Interestingly, however, the cause of the dissolution differed
substantially. Over 15% of women who had sex before the age
of 15 and married their first partner (ie, had an early marriage)
were ever-widowed compared with about 6% of women who
had sex before the age of 15 and did not marry their first sexual
partner (p = 0.004). In contrast, for most women (82.7%), later
sexual debut occurred with a spouse or a soon-to-be spouse and
was associated with a stable first marriage: 64.3% of women in
this group reported an intact first marriage (trajectory 7)
compared with slightly more than 50% of women following
other trajectories (trajectories 1, 4 and 10). Overall, the most
common trajectory began with a late sexual debut followed by a
stable marriage with the first sexual partner (31.9% of all
women considered, trajectory 7).
HIV outcomes of sexual and marital trajectories
Figure 2 shows the variations in HIV prevalence according to
the sexual and marital trajectories described above. Across all
trajectories the prevalence of HIV was lowest among women
who married their first sexual partner and remained married to
that same spouse. As noted above when discussing the results in
table 1, women who had an early sexual debut were slightly
more likely to be infected than those who delayed it (11.1% and
7.6%, respectively; p,0.10), although the difference was only
marginally significant. Among women with a sexual debut after
the age of 15, those who did not marry their first sexual partner
were much more likely to be HIV-positive than those who
married their first sexual partner (p,0.001). Among women
with a sexual debut at (15 years, however, women who did
not marry their first sexual partner were no more likely to be

HIV-positive than women who did. This finding can be
partially explained by the relatively high proportion of these
young married women who are ever-widowed and that 40% of
these widows are HIV-positive. Not surprisingly, widows
always exhibit an increased HIV prevalence (trajectories 3, 6,
9 and 12). Ever-divorced women also had a higher HIV
prevalence than women who remained in their first marriages.
The trajectories presented in figs 1 and 2 do not take into
account potentially confounding factors, most notably
women's age and their place of residence. In table 2 we show
the results of the logistic regression analysis of individual HIV
status as a function of trajectory membership, background
characteristics and sexual and marital partnership characteris-
tics for the ever-married women in our sample. Because of
endogeneity between marital dissolution and HIV status, we
use an ``abridged'' version of the full trajectories presented in
figs 1 and 2. This abridged version examines only the timing of
sexual debut and whether or not the respondent marries her
first sexual partner.
Model 1 evaluates the impact of trajectory membership on
HIV status controlling for age and region of residence. The
combination of delaying sexual debut and marrying one's first
sexual partner was associated with the lowest odds of being
infected with HIV. Women who delayed sexual debut and did
not marry their first sexual partner had the highest odds of
being HIV-positive (OR 2.59; p,0.05). These findings provide
an important insight: it appears that neither delaying sex nor
avoiding having a premarital partner alone offers a clear
protective advantage, but rather their effects are conditional
on each other.
Controlling for sexual and marital partnership characteristics
(model 2) only slightly reduces the magnitude of the effect
noted above, but not its significance (OR 2.52; p,0.05). We also
found, as others have,25 26 that the number of lifetime partners
(both spousal and non-spousal) was an important covariate of
HIV risk net of all other factors. Indeed, the number of lifetime
partners had a stronger impact on HIV risk than following any
of the trajectories in the model, although these experiences were
clearly interrelated.
DISCUSSION
We have explored the links between sexual and marital
trajectories and HIV status among ever-married women living
in rural Malawi. Our first set of findings (presented in fig 1)
shows that women's sexual and marital transitions are linked
over their life course. Of all the women, those who delay sex
and marry their first sexual partner are the most likely to have a
stable first marriage. In contrast, women who become sexually
active before the age of 15 and marry their first partner have
exceptionally high levels of widowhood. Even though our
trajectories do not control for women's age or marriage
duration, sexual and marital transitions are clearly trajectory-
dependent, although they are usually treated as independent
factors in HIV research.
Our second set of findings indicates that different sexual and
marital trajectories are related to current HIV status. Consistent
with other research,3­6 we found a weak bivariate association
between early sexual debut and a higher likelihood of HIV
infection, and a strong bivariate association between premarital
partners (other than one's spouse) and being HIV-positive.
Finally, in accordance with other studies showing an association
between marital disruption and HIV,14 15 we found that,
regardless of their premarital sexual histories, women who are
in their first marriage were the least likely to be HIV-infected.
This suggests that future research should focus on identifying
the direction of the causal relationship between a disrupted
marriage and HIV infection.14
Our main conclusion is methodological: important transi-
tions in the lives of women are not independent and thus
should not be considered in isolation. Although early sexual
debut, marrying one's first sexual partner and having a
disrupted marriage each increase the likelihood of HIV infection,
as reported by others,3­6 14 15 the risk is not additive. The
strongest evidence for this conclusion comes from our multi-
variate regression analyses (presented in table 2). We found a
clear interaction between delaying sexual debut and premarital
partnerships. Nearly half of the women in our sample delayed
sex and married their first partner, which is the trajectory
associated with the lowest prevalence of HIV. Simply delaying
sexual debut past the age of 15 alone, however, is not sufficient
protection: women who delay sexual activity but do not marry
their first partner are the most likely to become infected. This
result reflects both the higher rates of divorce and widowhood
as well as the higher rates of HIV among those divorced and
widowed in this group (see trajectories 11 and 12). Similarly,
marrying one's first sexual partner does not always reduce the
HIV risk. Conditional on early sexual activity, women who
married their first sexual partner were more likely to be HIV-
positive than those who did not. Since many of the women in
this category are young brides with older husbands, it is not
surprising that over 15% become widows. What is more
surprising is the rate of HIV infection among these early
marrying widows. An astonishing 40% were HIV-positive,
representing the trajectory associated with the highest levels of
HIV (trajectory 3). These findings highlight the complex and
dynamic relationships between life transitions and HIV risks,
which are often inadequately captured by focusing on individual
transitions rather than on their sequence.
One of the main limitations of our study is that it relies on
self-reported retrospective data that may be subject to a variety
of biases including problems in reporting dates with accuracy,
the selective omission of unsuccessful or short unions, and social
desirability bias when reporting on the occurrence and timing of
sexual partnerships. Our results may also be prone to selection
bias because women who were interviewed in 2001 but could
not be re-interviewed in 2004 were slightly more likely to have
already been divorced or widowed. Since HIV testing of MDICP
respondents began in 2004, we cannot determine whether HIV
prevalence among women lost to follow-up in 2004 was
different from HIV prevalence among the women who were
successfully re-interviewed. As a consequence, we cannot fully
determine the extent of this bias. We verified, however, that
there was no significant difference in sexual and marital
histories between women who accepted to be tested for HIV
in 2004 and those who refused. Moreover, since our results rely
on a sample of ever-married women, we cannot make direct
comparisons with women who never married. Finally, limita-
tions of the data used for the analysis include the fact that HIV
status was based on prevalent rather than incident infection, so
we cannot make causal inferences about HIV infection and
sexual and marital trajectories, particularly with respect to
marital dissolution. It is unlikely, however, that HIV is an
important determinant of the timing of sexual debut or of
having premarital partners since a very small percentage of
individuals in rural Malawi are aware of their HIV status.
Despite these limitations, our findings indicate the potential
of a life course perspective for providing insights into the
sources of variation in HIV infection. Sexual debut, marriage

and marital disruption all occur over time, as does HIV
infection; what we have shown is that the sequence matters.
The full potential that a life course perspective brings to
illuminate the mechanisms that determine distinct sexual
marital trajectories and differences in the lifetime probabilities
of HIV infection, in Malawi as elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa,
cannot be exploited without collecting new data that permit
establishing the timing of HIV infection in the life course of
individuals.

Take-home messages
c A life course approach was used to evaluate the relationship
between HIV infection and different sexual and marital
trajectories for women in rural Malawi.
c Important transitions in women's sexual and marital lives are
not independent from one another and thus should not be
considered in isolation.
c Women who delayed sexual debut and did not marry their first
partner are, once married, more likely to experience marital
disruption and to be HIV-positive.
c Women who marry their first partner, but who have sex at a
young age, are more likely to be widowed and are also at
considerable risk.
