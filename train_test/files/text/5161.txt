Abstract
Objective: To investigate levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in
Han Chinese patients with Helicobacter pylori-positive gastric low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia
(LGIN).
Methods: In this prospective, observational study, gastric specimens from patients with LGIN
were collected by gastroscopy with consecutive biopsy. EGF and PGE2 concentrations in serum
and gastric juice from patients with LGIN were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Presence of H. pylori infection was assessed in patients with LGIN and healthy controls.
Results: Out of 5 638 patients and 548 controls, H. pylori infection in patients with chronic gastritis
was associated with disease type (endoscopic classification) and disease severity. Patients with H.
pylori-positive LGIN had significantly higher concentrations of serum EGF and lower concentra-
tions of serum PGE2 versus patients with H. pylori-negative LGIN. Serum EGF and PGE2 levels in
patients with LGIN were not significantly associated with disease type, but were significantly
associated with disease severity.
Conclusions: H. pylori infection was associated with chronic gastritis type (endoscopic
classification) and disease severity. Abnormal EGF and PGE2 levels may be associated with H.
pylori-positive LGIN in Han Chinese patients in central China.

Introduction
Precancerous lesions are histological
abnormalities that may be associated with
an increased risk of developing cancer, and
according to the World Health Organization
(WHO) classification of tumours of the
digestive system,1 the recommended terms
for gastric precancerous lesions are low-
grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and
high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia.
In the Correa cascade of multistep gastric
carcinogenesis, an inflammation-metapla-
sia-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence indicates
that neoplasia may be a critical point for
malignant transformation.2
The majority of gastric cancers are known
to be associated with Helicobacter pylori
infection, and H. pylori is considered to be
a single risk factor for human gastric cancers
by the International Agency for Research on
Cancer.3 The chain of events leading to
gastric cancer associated with H. pylori
begins with normal gastric mucosa, followed
by chronic superficial gastritis, atrophic gas-
tritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and
finally adenocarcinoma.4 Atrophic gastritis
and intestinal metaplasia are thought to
exponentially increase the risk of developing
gastric cancer.4
Abnormal levels of epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) in gastric mucosa may induce
changes in gastric epithelial cells that lead
to cancer.5,6 Levels of serum and gastric
juice EGF and PGE2 in patients with
LGIN remain unclear. Thus, in the present
study, prevalence of H. pylori infection, and
the relationship between H. pylori infection
and type of chronic gastritis (assessed via
gastroscope), and disease severity, were
analysed in Han Chinese patients with
chronic gastritis in central China. Serum
and gastric juice levels of EGF and PGE2
in patients with LGIN were also
determined.
Patients and methods
Study population
In this prospective observational study,
Chinese patients with chronic gastritis
being treated at the Central Hospital of
Wuhan, Wuhan, China were sequentially
enrolled between May 2011 and April 2013.
There were no predefined exclusion criteria.
Gastric mucosal biopsy was performed
on consecutive patients with chronic gastri-
tis undergoing diagnostic gastroscopy.
Endoscopic classification of chronic gastritis
was categorized into superficial gastritis,
erosive gastritis, haemorrhagic gastritis or
atrophic gastritis according to the Dalian
Academic Conference criteria of the Chinese
Society of Digestive Endoscopy.7 LGIN was
determined according to the WHO
Classification of Tumours of the Digestive
System.1 The severity of chronic gastritis
was classified according to pathology (mild;
moderate; severe).8
For analysis of EGF and PGE2 concen-
trations in serum and gastric juice, a random
subgroup of patients with LGIN were
selected from the patients with chronic
gastritis. Pathological and endoscopic diag-
noses of all patients were performed by three
independent pathologists and three inde-
pendent endoscopists from The Central
Hospital of Wuhan.
Age- and sex-matched healthy controls
were selected from medical staff of The
Central Hospital of Wuhan, and from
healthy volunteers in the same geographic
area of Wuhan city. Healthy controls were
ethnically matched, had no symptoms
suggestive of chronic digestive tract disease
and had no personal or family history of
gastric cancer.
The study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of The Central Hospital of
Wuhan, and written informed consent was
obtained from all study participants.

Detection of H. pylori infection
Rapid urease and C14 breath tests were
performed in patients with chronic gastritis
and healthy controls, to investigate the
presence of H. pylori infection. Participants
were considered to be H. pylori-positive if
both tests gave a positive result.
Rapid urease tests were performed by
placing an endoscopic biopsy specimen into
a small amount of solution containing urea,
phenol red and preservatives. In the
presence of H. pylori, bacterial urease
hydrolysed the urea and produced ammo-
nia, resulting in a yellow-to-red colour
change. Results were read between 1 min
and 24 h. C14 breath tests were performed as
follows: Each participant swallowed a cap-
sule of urea labelled with 37 kBq (1 mCi) of
C14 and after 10 min was asked to exhale
into a balloon (Heliprobe BreathCardTM,
Kibion, Stockhom, Sweden), to collect a
breath sample, until the indicator membrane
changed colour from orange to yellow. In
the presence of H. pylori in the stomach,
urea would be converted into C14-labelled
carbon dioxide by urease enzyme. Samples
with values 25 counts per min (cpm) were
considered negative for H. pylori; those with
values !50 cpm were considered positive for
H. pylori infection.
Determination of EGF and PGE2
concentrations
A total of 4 ml venous blood from each
patient with LGIN was collected into serum
separator tubes and allowed to clot for
30 min at room temperature, followed by
centrifugation for 10 min at 1000 g at room
temperature. All serum samples were stored
at À70C until use.
Gastric juice samples were collected from
patients with LGIN into 4 ml centrifuge
tubes, and with 20 min following collection,
were centrifuged at 2 000 g for 30 min at
room temperature. The supernatant was
then separated into a 2 ml RNase-free cen-
trifuge tube and stored at À70C until use.
The EGF and PGE2 concentrations in
serum and gastric juice of patients with LGIN
were measured by human EGF enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
(Cat. No. BMS2070INST, Bender
Medsystems, Vienna, Austria) and prosta-
glandin E2 high sensitivity ELISA Kit (Cat.
No. ab133055, Abcam, Cambridge,
MA, USA), respectively, according to the
manufacturer's protocols. Plates were read at
450 nm and 405 nm against standard curves
for EGF and PGE2, respectively, with detec-
tion sensitivity for EGF and PGE2 of 0.26pg/
ml and 8.26pg/ml, respectively. Each sample
was tested in triplicate.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, USA). The sample size was esti-
mated at the 0.05 level of significance with a
two-sided test, and 88% statistical power to
detect an effect with a relative risk of 2.0.
Between-group comparisons of the H. pylori
infection rate were performed using 2-test.
Continuous variables were presented as
mean Æ SD, and were statistically analysed
using two-tailed, Student's t-test and one-
way analysis of variance. A P value < 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 5 638 Chinese patients with
chronic gastritis, comprising 3 219
(57.09%) male and 2 419 (42.91%) female
patients (mean age, 59.25 Æ 19.58 years),
and 548 age- and sex-matched healthy con-
trols (303 [55.29%] male and 245 [44.71%]
female; mean age, 56.23 Æ 13.45 years) were
included in this study. Of the patients with
Chen et al. 243
chronic gastritis, 82 patients with LGIN were
randomly selected for analysis of EGF and
PGE2 concentrations in serum and gastric
juice. Among these patients with LGIN, 49
(59.76%) were male and 33 (40.24%) were
female (mean age, 53.38Æ 14.26 years).
Prevalence of H. pylori infection
The prevalence of H. pylori was higher in
patients with chronic gastritis compared
with healthy controls (2 ¼ 285.8, P < 0.01;
Table 1), and was higher in patients with
erosive gastritis versus superficial gastritis
(2 ¼ 191.08, P < 0.01; Table 1).
When patients with chronic gastritis were
classified according to pathological severity,
the prevalence of H. pylori infection was
higher in those with severe inflammation
than in those with mild or moderate inflam-
mation (2 ¼ 234.5, P < 0.01; 2 ¼ 111.5,
P < 0.01, respectively; Table 2).
In patients with chronic gastritis, the
prevalence of H. pylori infection was
higher in patients with LGIN than in
patients with non-LGIN (264/294 [89.80%]
versus 3042/5344 [56.92%], 2 ¼ 122.8,
P < 0.01.
Serum and gastric juice EGF and PGE2
concentrations in patients with LGIN
Patients with H. pylori-positive LGIN (n¼ 58)
had significantly higher concentrations of
serum EGF (180.67 Æ 49.93 ng/l versus
68.51Æ 1.74ng/l, respectively; P < 0.01), and
lower concentrations of serum PGE2
(11.80Æ 1.83 ng/l versus 20.95Æ 3.40 ng/l,
respectively; P < 0.01) than patients with H.
pylori-negative LGIN (n ¼ 24). In patients
with LGIN, gastric juice EGF and PGE2
concentrations were not significantly different
between H. pylori-positive patients and H.
pylori-negative patients (EGF, 70.67Æ
15.21ng/l versus 56.78 Æ 12.34 ng/l, respect-
ively, P > 0.05; and PGE2, 8.67Æ 2.15 ng/l
versus 10.32Æ 2.65ng/l, respectively,
P > 0.05).
Serum concentrations of EGF and
PGE2 in patients with LGIN were not sig-
nificantly associated with disease endoscopic
classification but there was a significant
association with disease pathological sever-
ity (Table 3). Patients with severe LGIN had
significantly higher concentrations of serum

Discussion
The current study showed that prevalence of
H. pylori infection was higher in patients with
chronic gastritis than in healthy controls, in
the Han Chinese population of central
China. In patients with chronic gastritis,
the prevalence of H. pylori infection was
higher in patients with erosive gastritis
compared with superficial gastritis, higher in
patients with severe inflammation than in
patients with mild or moderate inflamma-
tion, and higher in patients with LGIN
compared with non-LGIN.
The current results suggested that the
prevalence of H. pylori infection may be
associated with the status of inflammation
of chronic gastritis, and might present a risk
effect for gastric precancerous lesions. A
study of Romanian patients with chronic
gastritis9 showed that all histological
changes were strongly related to H. pylori
infection and H. pylori infection was higher
in patients with gastric intraepithelial neo-
plasia versus those without gastric intrae-
pithelial neoplasia.
Intestinal metaplasia is associated with
H. pylori infection, smoking, bile reflux and
a high-salt diet.10 H. pylori infection might
be implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric
mucosal atrophy and intestinal metaplasia
by induction of the host inflammatory and
immune response, or by cytotoxins, such
as vacuolating cytotoxin A or cytotoxin-
associated gene A.11 H. pylori infection has
been suggested to cause an imbalance
between apoptosis and proliferation in
normal gastric epithelial cells, which is revers-
ible after H. pylori eradication.12 In addition,
intraepithelial neoplasia has been shown as
an important step in the occurrence of gastric
cancer induced by H. pylori infection.13 In
general, H. pylori infection is thought to
cause gastric cancer in an indirect way.3
The current study provided evidence that
patients with H. pylori-positive LGIN had
significantly higher serum EGF and lower
serum PGE2 concentrations than patients
with H. pylori-negative LGIN. Serum con-
centrations of EGF and PGE2 in patients
with LGIN were analysed following strati-
fication by endoscopic classification and
disease severity. Serum EGF and PGE2
concentrations in patients with LGIN were
not significantly associated with endoscopic
disease classification, but there was a

significant association with disease severity.
In patients with LGIN, significantly higher
concentrations of serum EGF and lower
concentrations of serum PGE2 were found
with severe disease compared with mild or
moderate disease; the authors speculate that
abnormal levels of EGF and PGE2 might be
involved in the pathogenesis of LGIN.
Epidermal growth factor is a polypeptide
that stimulates or inhibits the proliferation
of various cell types, and can stimulate the
synthesis of mRNA, DNA and protein in
epithelial cells to promote gastric mucosal
epithelial hyperplasia.14 High levels of
serum EGF and low levels of serum PGE2
have been observed in rats with chronic
atrophic gastritis.15 Moreover, levels of
serum EGF in rats with chronic atrophic
gastritis were found to be associated with
high levels of EGF receptor (R) expres-
sion.15,16 Abnormally high EGF expression
has been observed in the transition region of
paracarcinoma tissue, dysplastic cells and
tumour cells,17 and EGF has been found to
stimulate urokinase plasminogen activator
receptor expression and cell invasiveness
through extracellular signal regulated
kinase, activator protein-1, and nuclear
factor-kB signalling.18 H. pylori infection
has been indicated as a risk factor for
LGIN,19,20 and H. pylori may also stimulate
the process of compensatory proliferation
by promoting epithelial-cell apoptosis.21
Prostaglandin E2 is generally considered
to be a cell-protecting factor involved in the
repair of damaged gastric mucosal cells by
inhibiting secretion of gastric acid and
increasing blood flow to the gastric
mucosa.22 H. pylori infection increases the
number of inflammatory cells in gastric
mucosa, results in the production of many
inflammatory mediators and impairs cellu-
lar immune function of the gastric
mucosa,23 which may have been the cause
of decreased PGE2 levels observed in H.
pylori-positive patients with LGIN in the
current study.
The current study is limited by small
sample size and lack of functional investi-
gation of EGF and prostaglandin E2, such
as the mechanisms of interaction between
signalling from prostaglandin receptors and
EGFR in gastric mucosal cells. Therefore,
further studies with a larger sample size are
necessary to explore the biological mechan-
ism and investigate the specific biomarkers
of gastric precancerous lesions.
In conclusion, in this small-scale study,
the prevalence of H. pylori infection was
higher in Han Chinese patients from central
China who had chronic gastritis, compared
with healthy controls, in the current study.
In addition, H. pylori infection was asso-
ciated with chronic gastritis type (classified
by endoscopy) and disease severity. In add-
ition, high levels of serum EGF and low
levels of serum PGE2 were observed in H.
pylori-positive patients with LGIN, and
were associated with disease severity.
