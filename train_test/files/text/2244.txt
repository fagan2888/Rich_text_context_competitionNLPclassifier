Abstract
Background: Federally Qualified Health Centers are expanding to increase access for millions of more Americans
with a goal of doubling capacity to serve 40 million people. Health centers provide a lot of behavioral health
services but many have difficulty accessing mental health and substance use professionals for their patients. To
meet the needs of the underserved and newly insured it is important to better estimate how many behavioral
health professionals are needed.
Methods: Using health center staffing data and behavioral health service patterns from the 2010 Uniform Data
System and the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we estimated the number of patients likely to need
behavioral health care by insurance type, the number of visits likely needed by health center patients annually, and
the number of full time equivalent providers needed to serve them.
Results: More than 2.5 million patients, 12 or older, with mild or moderate mental illness, and more than 357,000
with substance abuse disorders, may have gone without needed behavioral health services in 2010. This level of
need would have required more than 11,600 full time providers. This translates to approximately 0.9 licensed
mental health provider FTE, 0.1 FTE psychiatrist, 0.4 FTE other mental health staff, and 0.3 FTE substance abuse
provider per 2,500 patients. These estimates suggest that 90% of current centers could not access mental health
services or provide substance abuse services to fully meet patients' needs in 2010. If needs are similar after health
center expansion, more than 27,000 full time behavioral health providers will be needed to serve 40 million medical
patients, and grantees will need to increase behavioral health staff more than four-fold.
Conclusions: More behavioral health is seen in primary care than in any other setting, and health center clients
have greater behavioral health needs than typical primary care patients. Most health centers needed additional
behavioral health services in 2010, and this need will be magnified to serve 40 million patients. Further testing of
these workforce models are needed, but the degree of current underservice suggests that we cannot wait to move
on closing the gap.
Background
Federally-Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) are non-
profit, community-directed health centers that provide
comprehensive health care to patients without regard to
income or insurance coverage. Often referred to as
Community Health Centers or simply "health centers",
these safety net providers offer primary and preventive
care, mental health, substance use, dental, and pharmacy
services to patients in high-need communities. Commu-
nity health centers address the physical, mental and so-
cial needs of their patients by providing access to
comprehensive health and social services.
Health centers eliminate many barriers to health care,
including cost, lack of insurance, geographic location,
language, and cultural competency for America's most
medically underserved populations. Health centers care
for 20% of all low-income, uninsured Americans, and 1
in 7 Medicaid beneficiaries [1]. Approximately 93% of

patients are at or below 200 percent of the federal pov-
erty level (FPL) and 76% are either covered by Medicaid/
CHIP or are uninsured [2]. Roughly two-thirds of pa-
tients are racial or ethnic minorities, and almost one-
quarter of patients are best served in a language other
than English [2].
Ensuring access to behavioral health services is a par-
ticularly important role for health centers since health
center patients likely have rates of mental illness and
substance use that are greater than the general popula-
tion. Health centers serve a disproportionate number of
uninsured, Medicaid insured, and patients below the fed-
eral poverty level compared to other primary care deliv-
ery sites. According to the National Survey on Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH), these patients are more likely
than the general population to have a behavioral health
disorder. In 2010, nearly 30 percent of uninsured per-
sons and those with incomes less than 100 percent of
the federal poverty level had any mental illness in the
past year, and almost one-third of Medicaid and CHIP
enrollees over age 12 suffered from a mental illness [3].
Nearly 7 percent of uninsured respondents abused illicit
drugs or alcohol in the past year [3]. In contrast, 20 percent
of the general population had any past year mental illness
in 2010, and 4.5% had a substance abuse disorder [3].
Given the unique potential of health centers to provide
behavioral health services for the neediest populations, it
is important to develop a method for quantifying how
many behavioral health professionals are needed to
adequately serve patients. With no national standard
for behavioral health staffing, health centers vary sig-
nificantly in the type and number of behavioral health
professionals they employ. The Affordable Care Act pro-
vided $9.5 billion in funding over 5 years through a dedi-
cated Health Center Fund, beginning in 2011, to allow
health centers to expand their operational capacity with
a goal of ensuring the newly insured would have access
points for care. These expansion efforts, which have
already commenced, provide an opportunity to plan for
the staff that will treat the whole person. This paper pre-
sents a needs-based method for estimating the behav-
ioral health staff needs of community health centers
currently, and projects the need for additional providers
as health centers expand to 40 million patients as a fu-
ture target.
The numbers of health centers and patients served
have grown significantly in the last two decades; there
are currently over 1,200 health center organizations pro-
viding care to more than 20 million patients in over
8,100 locations dispersed across the nation [2,4,5].
Under full funding provided by the Affordable Care Act
(ACA) of 2010 on top of health centers' federal discre-
tionary base and mandated Medicaid expansions in
every state, health centers would have reached 40 million
patients by 2015 [6]. Budget cuts to health centers' base-
line federal funding during FY 2011 significantly
curtailed expansion. The Supreme Court's ruling effect-
ively changing the ACA's Medicaid expansion into a
state option rather than a mandate will also restrain
health center growth in states that opt out. However,
continued federal and state investments will allow the
Health Center Program to grow.
Community health centers and behavioral health
At a minimum, all health centers that receive grant
funding from the Health Resources and Services Ad-
ministration (HRSA) under Section 330 of the Public
Health Service Act are required to provide referrals to
substance abuse and mental health providers. Evidence
suggests many grantees exceed this standard. Nearly
three-quarters of health centers had onsite mental
health or substance abuse staff in 2010, and they pro-
vided more than 5.2 million encounters [2]. Among en-
counters with a reported primary diagnosis in 2010,
encounters for depression were the third most fre-
quent, surpassed only by hypertension and diabetes
[2]. Given that most patients are uninsured or
Medicaid-insured, many of these patients likely would
have gone unserved. A 2004 survey of health center di-
rectors revealed that health centers without onsite
mental health services reported more difficulty
accessing specialty mental health services compared to
those that had these services onsite, particularly for
their uninsured and Medicaid patients [7].
Although epidemiologic evidence suggests a substan-
tial need for behavioral health services among low
income, uninsured, and Medicaid-insured individuals,
there are often significant barriers to receiving ad-
equate treatment. Historically, the behavioral health
sector has been segregated from the medical sector in
organization and financing, and research suggests this
fragmentation creates barriers to identifying and
treating mental health problems, especially for unin-
sured and Medicaid insured patients [8,9] Half of all
mental health problems in the U.S. population go un-
diagnosed, and a significant portion of patients diag-
nosed with a mental health or drug use disorder never
receive treatment [10,11]. Hispanics, non-Hispanic
blacks, and those with less education are less likely to
obtain specialty mental health care than the general
population [12-14]. Even when patients recognize a
need for behavioral health services, many are unaware
of their options for receiving that care, or have prob-
lems accessing the system due to availability of pro-
viders or financial barriers [15-18].
Under the current system, patients who seek behav-
ioral health care overwhelmingly seek it from general
medical providers, which have been described as the "de

facto" mental health system in the U.S. [11,13,19]. De-
cades of research have demonstrated the inseparability
of mental and physical health, and new models that
bring mental health providers into the primary care set-
ting as members of the health care team are proving ef-
fective at increasing the accessibility and acceptability of
mental health treatment [20]. In fully integrated care,
patients become accustomed to behavioral health care as
a "routine part" of primary care [21]. Care provided in
this manner has been shown to reduce stigma for
patients, increase patient engagement, and reduce at-
trition after care is initiated [22-24]. Rural areas and
underserved urban areas also benefit significantly from
integrated care, since shortages of behavioral health pro-
viders create long wait times for patients needing ap-
pointments [16].
Despite a significant number of integrated behavioral
health-primary care initiatives in the U.S., no standards
exist for staffing. In 2003, Faulkner published a needs-
based approach to modeling the psychiatric workforce
based on disease prevalence, need for treatment and
available resources [25]. In recent years, the federal gov-
ernment has recognized the need for behavioral health
workforce planning at the national level to improve ac-
cess and quality across distributed delivery sites. For ex-
ample, five years after deploying the largest integrated
behavioral health-primary care system in history, the
Veterans Administration (VA) concluded delivery sites
need more "central guidance on best practices in deter-
mining needed mental health staff" [26]. In 2007, the
Department of Defense (DOD) Task Force on Mental
Health recommended the DOD adopt a risk-adjusted
population-based model for estimating the number and
clinical specialty ratios for behavioral health providers in
military medical departments [27]. The model, the
Psychological Health Risk-Adjusted Model for Staffing,
analyzes input on need for services among Defense
Health Plan beneficiaries, provider productivity, and non-
encounter based factors to project the number and ratio
of mental health staff needed [28].
Methods
We developed a method to estimate how many full time
equivalent (FTE) behavioral health providers were needed
across the health center program using data on prevalence
of behavioral health disorders and existing staffing and
utilization patterns among grantees. Using data on com-
munity health center staffing and service patterns from
the 2010 Uniform Data System (UDS) and nationally rep-
resentative data on mental illness and substance abuse
from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health,
we estimated the number of patients likely to need behav-
ioral health care by insurance type, the number of visits
likely needed by these patients in a year, and the number
of full time equivalent providers needed to serve them
(Figure 1).
The Uniform Data System is an annual collection of
data by HRSA on health center organizational character-
istics and performance. Recipients of grants under Sec-
tion 330 of the Public Health Service Act are required to
report UDS data annually. This study used counts of
FTE psychiatrists, psychologists, licensed clinical social
workers, other licensed mental health professionals (psy-
chiatric social workers, psychiatric nurse practitioners,
family therapists, and other licensed master's degree-
prepared clinicians), mental health staff (certified indi-
viduals who provide counseling, treatment or support
services related to mental health professionals), and sub-
stance abuse staff from the UDS. The UDS also provided
counts of medical patients, mental health patients and
encounters by provider type, and the number of sub-
stance abuse patients and encounters.
Estimates of need for behavioral health services were
derived from the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health. Sponsored by the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the NSDUH
is an annual survey of approximately 70,000 individuals
aged 12 or older across the U.S. on the use of illicit
drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and mental health conditions.
For this study, the NSDUH provided estimates of past
year mental illness and illicit drug or alcohol abuse
by insurance type, which included Medicare, Medicaid/
CHIP, private insurance, and uninsured. The NSDUH
creates a categorical mental illness indicator from re-
sponses to survey questions, including total scores from
the psychological distress and impairment scales, the
predicted probability of serious mental illness (SMI), and
indicators of various levels of mental illness. Categories
include no mental illness, mild mental illness, moderate
mental illness, and serious mental illness. The NSDUH
creates an indicator for illegal drug or alcohol abuse for
respondents that provide a positive response to one or
more criteria for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin,
hallucinogen, inhalant, pain reliever, tranquilizer, stimu-
lant, or sedative abuse. Respondents are either classified
as positive or negative for substance abuse.
We started our estimation by examining annual behav-
ioral health service utilization at the grantee level from
the 2010 UDS (Table 1). The annual number of mental
health visits per mental health patient and substance
abuse visits per substance abuse patient were calculated
for each grantee with onsite behavioral health staff. The
distribution of mental health visits to psychiatrists, li-
censed mental health providers (psychologists, licensed
clinical social workers, psychiatric social workers, psy-
chiatric nurse practitioners, family therapists, and other
licensed master's degree-prepared clinicians), and other
mental health staff was calculated by summing visits

across grantees with onsite mental health staff and cal-
culating the percent of visits to each provider type. We
estimated the annual visit load for each provider type by
dividing the number of visits in each provider category
by the number of FTE for grantees with onsite behav-
ioral health staff.
Estimating the need for mental health staff
Next, we estimated the need for mental health services
among medical patients age 12 and over. We selected
health center medical patients as opposed to all health
center patients (e.g. dental patients) because we assume
most mental health and substance abuse patients are
also medical patients, and more importantly, because
health centers aim to integrate these services within
physical health care to address patients' full and inter-
related health care needs.
The NSDUH indicates those covered by Medicare have
similar rates of mental illness to those with private insur-
ance. Similarly, the uninsured and those with Medicaid/
CHIP have similar rates of mental illness (Figure 2). We
used insurance data from the UDS to group medical pa-
tients for each grantee into two categories: 1) Medicaid/
CHIP/Other public insurance and uninsured, and 2)
Medicare and private insurance. Applying prevalence data
of past year mental illness by insurance type from the

NSDUH, we estimated the number of patients age 12 and
over likely to have mild or moderate mental illness , our
target population for mental health treatment. Estimates
were calculated for all grantees, including those without
current mental health staff or patients. We excluded ser-
ious mental illness from this analysis because we assumed
patients with SMI had a high likelihood of receiving men-
tal health care in other safety net mental health settings,
and the median number of visits per patient would greatly
underestimate the need for providers to serve this
population.
Using the median annual number of visits per mental
health patient, we calculated the annual number of visits
likely needed by patients with mild or moderate mental
illness for all grantees. We divided these visits into those
provided by licensed mental health providers, psychia-
trists, and other mental health staff using the distribu-
tion of visits by provider type from the UDS. We divided
the number of visits required by each provider type by
the estimated annual visit load to determine the total
number of FTE needed per grantee. Provider shortages
were calculated by subtracting existing FTE from esti-
mates of needed FTE.
Estimating need for substance abuse staff
We estimated the need for substance abuse services by
applying prevalence data of past year illicit drug or alco-
hol abuse by insurance type from the NSDUH to the
two groups of medical patients, Medicaid/CHIP/Other
public insurance and uninsured, and Medicare and pri-
vate insurance (Figure 2). We excluded patients with
illicit drug or alcohol dependence from this analysis. Pa-
tients with dependence are different from patients with
abuse and likely receive treatment in inpatient specialty
settings. Using the median annual number of visits per
substance abuse patient from the UDS, we calculated
the annual number of visits likely needed by patients age
12 and over at each grantee, including those currently
without onsite staff or patients. We divided the number
of visits required by the estimated annual visit load per
substance abuse FTE to determine the total number of

**Includes unlicensed individuals, including "certified" individuals who provide
counseling, treatment or support services related to mental
health professionals.
The UDS reports the number of patients by medical insurance type for two
age categories, ages 0-19 and ages 20+. Across all health centers in 2010,
35.3% of patients were ages 0-19, and 64.7% were age 20 or older. Of patients
age 0-19, 64.5% were age 0-11, and 35.5% were age 12-19. This age
distribution was used to calculate the number of patients by insurance type
ages 0-11 and ages 12-19 for each grantee. We selected only those age 12
and over for our analysis, since the NSDUH provides mental health and
substance abuse prevalence data on persons age 12 and over.
***The UDS defines a substance abuse visit as "a visit between a substance
abuse provider (e.g., a mental health provider or a credentialed substance
abuse counselor, rehabilitation therapist, psychologist) and a patient during
which alcohol or drug abuse services (i.e., assessment and diagnosis,
treatment, or after care) are provided". The UDS defines substance abuse
services as "psychiatric nurses, psychiatric social workers, mental health nurses,
clinical psychologists, clinical social workers, and family therapists and other
individuals providing counseling and/or treatment services related to
substance abuse".

FTE needed per grantee. Provider shortages were calcu-
lated by subtracting existing FTE from estimates of
needed FTE.
Expansion to 40 million patients
We then used our method to project the need for men-
tal health providers at health center capacity of 40 mil-
lion medical patients. Given the Supreme Court's ruling
of the ACA, states now have the option of expanding
Medicaid eligibility to all U.S. citizens with incomes up
to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. Under the
ACA, those with incomes up to 400 percent of the FPL
will receive subsidies to purchase private insurance
through the exchanges, starting in 2014. This will
change the distribution of insurance at health centers.
Models suggest the vast majority of new Medicaid
enrollees will be previously uninsured, but estimates vary
based on their assumptions [29]. Research also suggests
income fluctuations will cause people to cycle between
Medicaid and the insurance exchanges as their eligibility
changes [30]. Although changes in the ACA and health
center federal funding may restrain their growth, we
maintain 40 million as a reasonable patient goal given
substantial levels of unmet health care needs across the
United States.
Given the uncertainty over how the ACA will alter the
insurance coverage of health center patients, we made
several assumptions for our projection. Since 72 percent
of patients were below 100 percent of the FPL and 93%
were below 200 percent of the FPL in 2010, we assumed
a large portion of uninsured health center patients
would become eligible for Medicaid. We also assumed
the portion of patients covered by Medicare or private
insurance would not change dramatically as the number
of patients increased. Significantly fewer providers
accept public insurance compared to those that accept
private insurance or Medicare, giving Medicare and pri-
vate insurance patients greater flexibility in choosing a
provider. We assumed this would remain true under
insurance expansion, and that health centers would con-
tinue to serve a large portion of patients on public insur-
ance and a significant number of patients remaining
without insurance.
Behavioral health staff for 40 million patients
Using the 2010 UDS, we applied the mean percentage of
patients on public insurance or uninsured by grantee to
sort the 40 million medical patients into our two cat-
egories, Medicaid/CHIP/Other public insurance/unin-
sured, and Medicare/private insurance. Applying the
average prevalence data of past year mild or moderate
mental illness and illicit drug or alcohol abuse by insur-
ance type from the NSDUH, we estimated the number
of patients age 12 and over likely to need behavioral
health treatment.
Using the median visit data from our model (Table 1),
we estimated the annual number of visits likely needed
by patients with mild or moderate mental illness, and
substance abuse disorders. We divided mental health
visits into those provided by licensed mental health pro-
viders, psychiatrists, and other mental health staff using
the distribution of visits by provider type. We divided
the number of visits required by each provider type by
the annual visit load to determine the total number of
FTE needed per grantee.
No IRB or ethical approval was sought for this study
since it is a secondary analysis of using entirely public,
de-identified data. We do not display U.S. territories and
states with fewer than three grantees to avoid indirect
identification.
Results
The results from our model suggested a substantial
number of medical patients age 12 and over likely had a
need for behavioral health services in 2010 (Table 2).
This included more than 2.5 million patients with mild
or moderate mental illness, and more than 357,000 with
illicit drug or alcohol abuse disorders. Using the median
number of visits per behavioral health patient from the
UDS, we estimated more than 11,600 behavioral health
FTE were needed to serve them in 2010. The model sug-
gested the need for approximately 0.9 licensed mental
health provider FTE, 0.1 FTE psychiatrist, 0.4 FTE other
mental health staff, and 0.3 FTE substance abuse pro-
vider per 2,500 medical patients.
According to this model, 1,012 grantees (90%) were
unable to provide onsite mental health services to some
segment of their patients in 2010 due to capacity con-
straints (Table 2). Across all grantees, an additional 1.7
million patients likely would have benefited from onsite
mental health services, with an additional 6,992 mental
health FTE (licensed MH providers, psychiatrists, and
other MH staff) needed to serve them. The greatest ab-
solute shortage was in licensed mental health provider
FTE (4,328). The model suggested a need for as many as
2.5 times the number of psychiatrist FTE over existing
staff across all grantees.
One hundred twelve grantees (10%) provided mental
health care to a greater number of patients in 2010 than
our method identified as a target for mental health treat-
ment. These grantees served 110,000 more patients than
the model identified as likely to have mild or moderate
mental illness. This suggests that patients at these health
centers had particularly high prevalence of mild or mod-
erate mental illness, they treated patients with more se-
vere mental illness, or patients were treated for mental
health that did not use general medical services.
Burke et al. BMC Health Services Research 2013, 13:245 Page 6 of 12
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/13/245
The model suggested 1,002 grantees (89%) needed to
expand their onsite substance abuse services in order to
fully meet patients' needs in 2010 (Table 2). Across all
grantees, an additional 302,000 patients likely would
have benefited from onsite substance abuse services. An
additional 1,785 substance abuse FTE would have been
needed to serve them.
One hundred twenty-two (11%) grantees treated a
greater number of patients for illicit drug or alcohol
abuse in 2010 than our model identified as a target popu-
lation for substance abuse treatment. These grantees
served nearly 44,000 more patients than our model iden-
tified as likely to abuse illicit drugs or alcohol, again
suggesting that some health center patient populations
have higher than expected rates of illicit drug or alcohol
abuse, grantees treated patients with more severe substance
use problems, or patients were treated for substance use
that did not use general medical services.
Assuming utilization patterns and provider productiv-
ity remain similar, we estimated more than 27,000 be-
havioral health FTE will be needed to serve 40 million
medical patients (Table 3). The target number of behav-
ioral health patients would be approximately 6.7 million
annually. The model suggested grantees will need to in-
crease behavioral health staff more than four-fold over
2010 levels to meet the needs of the additional patients.
State level findings
States and communities vary in their staffing needs given
a wide variety of national, state, and local factors that in-
fluence provider location and practice decisions. Our
analysis also generated state-level estimates of additional
behavioral health staff currently needed in order to ex-
pand access to care for health center patients (Table 4).
Discussion
The results of this study suggested most health center
grantees needed additional capacity for providing onsite
behavioral health services in 2010, and the current con-
straints are likely to be magnified as health centers ex-
pand to 40 million patients. This may be reflective of
constraints in the behavioral health workforce in the
U.S. in general. Shortages of providers, particularly psy-
chiatrists, have been described, and the workforce is
aging as fewer graduates are entering some behavioral
health professions [31,32]. The need for additional pro-
viders in rural and less affluent areas has also been well
documented [33]. There are currently no complete na-
tional data on practicing behavioral health providers, but
Ellis et al estimated the mental health workforce was
about 350,000 in 2009, with psychiatrists and advanced
practice psychiatric nurses in shortest supply [33]. State
and federal programs designed to bring behavioral health
professionals to medical underserved areas, such as the
National Health Services Corps, play a vital role in

connecting communities to these health care resources,
but recruitment may be limited by insufficient supply.
Our model estimated 6,992 additional mental health
FTE were needed in health centers in 2010, which is less
than 2 percent of the workforce of all providers.
A small number of vanguard health systems, including
the Veterans Administration model of collaborative
mental health-primary care at the White River Junction
(WRJ) VA Medical Center, provide evidence to inform
staffing. As of 2010, the White River Junction clinics
employed one therapist, one psychiatrist, and twelve pri-
mary care physicians for every 14,000 primary care pa-
tients [26]. Compared to our model, the WRJ clinics
employed significantly fewer therapists per capita, but
nearly the same ratio of psychiatrists.
Our estimates are shaped and limited by health cen-
ters' current staffing patterns. Communities will need to
account for their own local preferences, partnerships,
and available resources when making staffing and deliv-
ery decisions. For instance, both urban and rural com-
munities experience a high rate of psychiatrist vacancies,
which likely will hinder recruitment [34]. For these rea-
sons, the total number of FTE needed to reach 40 mil-
lion patients may be more informative than the number
of FTE for each provider type.
It is also important to note primary care providers play
a major role in screening, treating, and referring patients
to appropriate behavioral health services. They are often
the first point of contact for behavioral health needs,
and they are responsible for most anti-depressants pre-
scribed in the U.S. [35,36]. Integrating behavioral health
into primary care does not reduce the need for primary
care providers, but redistributes some of that care as a
team of providers shares responsibility for the whole
patient.
Future staffing needs, particularly as more health cen-
ters move to fully integrate behavioral health services
into primary care and adopt new patient empanelment
processes, are difficult to predict because staffing models
and the location of behavioral health service delivery are
changing. Health centers across the nation are fully inte-
grating behavioral health into routine primary care prac-
tices and transitioning into recognized Patient-Centered
Medical Homes (PCMH). Accordingly, the use of inter-
disciplinary primary care teams along with more robust
self-management support and patient education re-
sources will influence how care is practiced. What is
clear is the need to significantly increase the behavioral
health workforce, as well as evolving their competencies
and skills required to effectively function in an interdis-
ciplinary primary care team.
There are several issues that must be addressed as we
work toward filling the behavioral health workforce gaps
in health centers:
1) Behavioral health provider supply: The overall
supply of behavioral health providers in all
professional categories will likely limit health
centers' ability to recruit providers.
2) Training and education: The majority of primary
care and behavioral health providers were not
trained to work together. Retraining providers to
adapt to the professional culture of integrated
behavioral health and primary care will be necessary
to maximize the effectiveness of the model.
3) Financing for sustainability: Achieving financial
sustainability to continue to support integration is
paramount due to the historic separation of mental
health funding from physical health funding.
Funding for these services will need to be protected
against reallocation to other pressing needs. This
requires continued federal and state investment in
health centers, including the availability of health
center Expanded Medical Capacity grants for
behavioral health services made available under
federal health center funding.
4) Measurement and evaluation: Continuing to
examine the impact of integrated services, both in
health centers and other sites, will shape the more
widespread adoption of this new model of

healthcare across the system. Assessing clinical,
operational and financial outcomes upon achieving
the recommended staffing is also encouraged to
determine what improvements in clinical outcomes
and savings are seen in the system.
Several provisions of the ACA are aimed at mitigating
the shortage of behavioral health providers in commu-
nity based settings, through fostering care integration or
training. In addition, a joint collaboration between the
federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration and HRSA has funded community-based
partnerships that promote the integration of primary
and behavioral health care.
Limitations
First, the UDS data create some limitations. The UDS
includes encounters and patients for services provided
off-site (i.e., not through a health center-employed clin-
ician) but paid for by the health center. We limited our
utilization analysis to grantees with behavioral health
staff onsite, but we may have overestimated the number
of visits a health center provider can reasonably provide
if some patients from those grantees also received ser-
vices offsite. Furthermore, the UDS does not break out
staffing categories beyond what is provided here.
Utilization data from the UDS were significantly
skewed, with a small number of grantees reporting large
numbers visits per provider and/or visits per behavioral
health patient. Variations in disease severity, staffing
models, and treatment modalities will influence the an-
nual number of visits per patient and per clinician. It is
likely that certain health centers treat a significant num-
ber of patients with SMI, which we excluded from this
study. We used median values to estimate the number
of providers needed, but the model could be run with
other cut-points to account for differences in service
use. It is likely an underestimation of actual need but ab-
sent data on what number of visits is adequate for this
population, it is at least rooted in the experience of pa-
tients receiving care in these settings. We chose the me-
dian to estimate the midpoint of those experiences
across all health centers with such services. It offers a
measure of equity across FQHCs even if it doesn't
achieve adequacy. That is, it offers a measure of what
workforce would be needed to achieve the same level of
service across all health centers given the evidence-
based prevalence of need for such care. This analysis
also used only one year of data, though it was the most
recent at the time. Changing staffing models may be ap-
parent when exploring future or more years of UDS.
Second, we acknowledge that under broad insurance
expansion, most uninsured patients will likely gain
coverage through Medicaid, though many will also gain
private insurance through the exchanges. Because our
two categories of insurance represent applied bench-
marks for assessing workforce needs, we recognize that
our estimates under these insurance-based assumptions
are relatively conservative.
Third, our estimates are still based on current staffing
patterns in FQHC. Research has highlighted that health
centers often experience staffing shortages and that they
serve more patients per provider compared to other pro-
viders [37]. It remains unclear whether the allocation of
behavioral health positions would be made according to
historic staffing patters or a new model. Further, esti-
mates for staffing in general may be low given the pre-
sumption that by expanding behavioral health services,
more patients may be retained over time in the FQHC.
Fourth, data from the NSDUH may likely underesti-
mate need for behavioral health in FQHCs as it is based
on general estimates from a national survey not neces-
sarily reflective of the population seen in FQHCs.
Finally, because our study data sources were
constrained to those age 12 and older, we likely under-
estimate behavioral health service needs for the full
range of patients served in these settings and neglect
specific counts of child behavioral health specialists.
Conclusions
Integrating behavioral health providers into primary care
creates a promising opportunity to better meet the be-
havioral health needs of health center patients by redu-
cing the fragmentation that creates so many barriers for
vulnerable populations. More mental health is seen in
primary care than in any other setting, and the number
of primary care patients served by community health
centers is expected to expand significantly. As health
centers grow, so will access to needed health care ser-
vices, but only with appropriate planning. We need a
better understanding of how many behavioral health
providers are needed in health centers. This paper adds
to the literature by proposing one way to assess the be-
havioral workforce need as well as the implications of
these recommendations for health policy.
