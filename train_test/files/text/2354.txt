Aims: To determine risk for central nervous system/autonomic nervous system (CNS/ANS) signs
following in utero cocaine and opiate exposure.
Methods: A multisite study was designed to determine outcomes of in utero cocaine and opiate expo-
sure. A total of 11 811 maternal/infant dyads were enrolled. Drug exposed (EXP) infants were identi-
fied by maternal self report of cocaine or opiate use or by meconium testing. Of 1185 EXP, meconium
analysis confirmed exposure in 717 to cocaine (CO) only, 100 to opiates (OP), and 92 to opiates plus
cocaine (OP+CO); 276 had insufficient or no meconium to confirm maternal self report. Negative
exposure history was confirmed in 7442 by meconium analysis and unconfirmed in 3184. Examiners
masked to exposure status, assessed each enrolled infant. Using generalised estimating equations,
adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated for manifesting a constel-
lation of CNS/ANS outcomes and for each sign associated with cocaine and opiate exposure.
Results: Prevalence of CNS/ANS signs was low in CO, and highest in OP+CO. Signs were significantly
related to one another. After controlling for confounders, CO was associated with increased risk of mani-
festing a constellation of CNS/ANS outcomes, OR (95% CI): 1.7 (1.2 to 2.2), independent of OP effect,
OR (95% CI): 2.8 (2.1 to 3.7). OP+CO had additive effects, OR (95% CI): 4.8 (2.9 to 7.9). Smoking
also increased the risk for the constellation of CNS/ANS signs, OR (95% CI) of 1.3 (1.04 to 1.55) and
1.4 (1.2 to 1.6), respectively, for use of less than half a pack per day and half a pack per day or more.
Conclusion: Cocaine or opiate exposure increases the risk for manifesting a constellation of
CNS/ANS outcomes.
Central nervous system (CNS) and autonomic nervous
system (ANS) manifestations are reported in neonates
born to mothers who used heroin or methadone during
pregnancy.1­3 Those CNS and ANS signs observed within the first
few days after birth comprise the manifestations reported with
neonatal "abstinence syndrome" or neonatal narcotic with-
drawal syndrome.1­3 At delivery, transplacental drug transfer
ceases while neonatal drug metabolism and excretion continue,
leading to drug disappearance and,consequently,manifestations
of neonatal "withdrawal" or "abstinence".3 In the 1960s and
1970s, high prevalence of heroin abuse and use of methadone as
a regimen to treat heroin addiction, especially in pregnant
women, heightened awareness of neonatal withdrawal
syndrome.4­9 The syndrome was also recognised in infants of
mothers using other drugs, such as sedatives, analgesics, stimu-
lants, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications.10­13 How-
ever, there is variation in reported effects and prevalence of
withdrawal manifestations when in utero exposure involves pri-
marily cocaine.14 15 Madden et al observed no signs of teratogenic-
ity with cocaine exposure.16 In another series, neither with-
drawal signs nor illness distinguished cocaine exposed infants
from controls.17 Cherukuri et al found only mild abnormal
neurobehavioural manifestations.18 On the other hand, Chasnoff
and colleagues19 reported that tremulousness and startle
responses tended to be of greater severity in infants exposed to
cocaine compared to those exposed to methadone alone or non-
exposed controls. Studies by Oro and Dixon20 and by Napi-
orkowski and colleagues21 revealed that cocaine exposed infants
exhibited more stress behaviour, increased tone, motor activity,
jerky movements, tremors, and more CNS signs than non-
exposed controls. In other reports, CNS and other neurological
abnormalities were severe as detected clinically, radiologically, or
by electroencephalographic and physiological studies.22­27
As part of a multisite study, the Maternal Lifestyle Study
(MLS), to evaluate acute and long term effects of in utero
cocaine and or opiate exposure on infant outcomes,28 we
estimated the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in neonates born to
mothers who used cocaine/opiates during pregnancy. A priori,
we addressed the hypothesis that compared to non-exposed
infants, the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs would be increased in
infants exposed to cocaine or opiates in utero. We further
hypothesised that there would be no difference in the
prevalence of these signs between cocaine and opiate exposure.
METHODS
The study involved a multisite evaluation of effects of mater-
nal lifestyle choices during pregnancy on their infants' acute
and long term developmental outcomes in four centres of the
National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
Neonatal Research Network. These sites included Brown Uni-
versity (Providence, RI), University of Miami (Miami, FL), The
University of Tennessee, Memphis (Memphis, TN), and Wayne
State University (Detroit, MI). The Biostatistics Coordinating
Center at George Washington University, Washington, DC,
provided data management, research coordination, and statis-
tical design and analysis, and later was succeeded by the
Research Triangle Institute (Research Triangle Park, NC). A
detailed description of this study has been reported
previously.28

Enrolment was carried out between May 1993 and May 1995
with the following eligibility criteria: (1) inborn; (2) birth
weight >500 g; (3) singleton gestation; (4) best obstetrical esti-
mate of gestational age (GA) <43 weeks; (5) not unlikely to
survive; (6) birth within the stipulated sampling time frame
specific to each clinical site as determined by each site's number
of live births and a priori estimated prevalence of drug use
among pregnant women. Maternal exclusion criteria were age
<18 years, institutionalised for mental retardation or emotional
disorder, or diagnosis of psychosis. After informed consent,
mothers were interviewed for a brief history on illicit drug,
cigarette, and alcohol use during the 12 months prior to birth. If
a mother smoked during pregnancy, she was asked whether she
smoked less than half a pack of cigarettes per day, or half a pack
or more per day. If she drank alcohol, she was asked if she drank
<1 drink/month, 1­3 drinks/month, or >1 drink/week, and
whether she had >5 drinks at any one time (binge).
Infants were assessed by a research nurse masked to the
infant's drug exposure status. Research nurses involved in the
study had training and certification on procedures, assess-
ment, and definitions of variables according to the MLS
Manual of Operations. Vital signs and growth measurements
were obtained, and GA by New Ballard29 examination
determined with physical examination, and evaluation for
presence of CNS/ANS signs.19­23 30 31 CNS signs assessed
included abnormalities (microphthalmia, encephalocoele,
meningomyelocoele, skull defect), disturbances in state, activ-
ity, or tone (hyperactivity, hyperalertness, hypertonicity, hypo-
tonicity, jitteriness/tremors, high pitched cry, weak cry, abnor-
mal posture, fisting, difficult to console, difficult to arouse,
irritability, lethargy), and eye signs (notable strabismus,
nystagmus, and sunset eye sign). ANS signs evaluated
included sweating, sneezing, hiccoughing, mottling, bradycar-
dia, tachycardia, poor suck, excessive suck, nasal stuffiness,
hyperthermia, and hypothermia.
Meconium was also collected and specimens were centrally
assayed at El Sohly Laboratories, Oxford, MS. Each specimen
received was analysed for presence of cocaine and opiates by
enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT), with
subsequent confirmation of positive samples using gas
chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS).32
Non-exposed (NON) and exposed (EXP) groups were
defined a priori during the study design. NON infants were
those whose mother denied both cocaine and opiate use dur-
ing pregnancy, confirmed by a negative EMIT screen. Infants
were considered EXP either by maternal self report of cocaine
and/or opiate use, or by meconium results that were positive
for cocaine or opiates by GC/MS. Infants were considered
exposed to cocaine (CO) only, opiate (OP) only, and to both
drugs (OP+CO) if exposure was confirmed by GC/MS
meconium analysis.
Statistical methods included estimation of prevalence of
each of the CNS/ANS signs in NON, EXP, CO, OP, and OP+CO
groups. The EXP was first compared to NON, and odds ratios
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each of the
CNS/ANS signs determined. Signs that were significant at
p < 0.05 by univariate analysis were selected as the CNS/ANS
outcomes for subsequent multivariate analysis.
In the multivariate analysis, we chose not to fit separate
regression models for each CNS/ANS sign or outcome, as this
was deemed vulnerable to problems of multiple comparisons,
therefore increasing the type I error to unacceptable levels.
Instead, we adopted a multivariate modelling approach
wherein we simultaneously modelled all CNS/ANS outcomes
found significant by univariate tests as a function of drug
exposure and other covariates. We did this by testing the con-
stellation of CNS/ANS outcomes for each infant as repeated
binary measures (yes/no) on the same subject and then used
generalised estimating equations (GEE) to fit the model and
estimate its parameters.33­35 This statistical approach avoided
the problems with multiple comparisons by fitting a single
model to the data. Moreover, since it recognises that all the
CNS/ANS outcomes for an infant may be inter-related and
together constitute one syndrome, this approach is statistically
more efficient than fitting separate models for each outcome.
In addition, it allowed for outcome specific exposure effects,
and we were able to test whether each specific outcome was
affected by exposure to cocaine and/or opiates. In other words,
through the statistical modelling, we can derive the odds ratio
(OR) for the overall effect of exposure on manifesting the syn-
drome or constellation of CNS/ANS signs/outcomes as well as
the estimated OR for manifesting each individual sign.

Using the above approach, we first determined the effects of
EXP on CNS/ANS outcomes while controlling for confound-
ers. Then another analysis was done to determine specifically
the effects of confirmed CO and OP on outcomes using similar
covariates. The covariates chosen for analysis included clinical
site, GA, postnatal age at assessment, gender, race, maternal
marital status, highest grade of education completed, Medic-
aid status, prenatal care, sexually transmitted diseases includ-
ing AIDS/HIV, and use of marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco dur-
ing pregnancy. Alcohol use and tobacco use were entered into
the model with four and three levels, respectively, as obtained
from maternal interview at enrolment. Birth weight and other
birth measurements were highly correlated with GA and were
not included in the multivariate model to avoid colinearity. In
the final multivariate models, covariates that were not statis-
tically significant (p > 0.05) were excluded. Adjusted OR
(95% CI) for the constellation of signs as well as for each CNS/
ANS manifestation with each type of exposure (EXP, CO, OP,
and OP+CO) were estimated from the multivariate models.
RESULTS
A total of 19 079 mother/infant dyads were screened for study
recruitment; 16 988 (89%) met eligibility criteria, and 11 811
(70%) consented to study participation. From these, adequate
meconium was collected in 7442 infants, allowing confirma-
tion of a negative history--that is, non-exposed (NON). There
were 3184 whose mothers had denied use, but no or
inadequate meconium was collected. Table 1 presents charac-
teristics of this group. Because of unconfirmed non-exposure,
these infants were excluded from analysis. A total of 1185
were EXP, of whom 980, 113, and 92, respectively, were
exposed to cocaine, opiate, or both. Exposure to CO only, OP
only, and OP+CO was confirmed in 717, 100, and 92, respec-
tively. Insufficient or no meconium was collected for
confirmation of drug use in the remaining 276.
Of mothers who used opiates during pregnancy, 93% used
heroin and/or methadone. Mothers in the EXP group were
significantly older than those in the NON: mean (SD) age of
29.6 (5.1) years compared to 26.1 (5.8) years in the NON.
Mothers in the CO only, OP only, and OP+CO groups were also
older than NON, having mean (SD) ages, respectively, of 30.1
(4.8), 28.6 (6.4), and 32.4 (5.6) years. Table 1 shows that a
higher proportion of mothers in the EXP group were black, not
married, with education of <12 years, with inadequate prena-
tal care, smoked cigarettes, consumed alcohol, smoked
marijuana during pregnancy, and had sexually transmitted
diseases, compared to NON. Maternal and infant characteris-
tics of the CO group were similar to EXP. The OP and OP+CO
groups did not differ from NON with regard to race or mater-
nal education. A higher proportion of infants with lower GA
and birth weight were seen in all EXP groups compared to
NON. Birth length, mean (SD), in EXP was 46.5 (4.7) cm, sig-
nificantly shorter than 48.9 (4.5) cm in NON. Mean (SD) head
circumference measurements in EXP, CO, OP, and CO+OP
were 32.0 (2.9), 31.9 (2.8), 32.9 (3.1), and 31.7 (3.2) cm
respectively, significantly smaller (p < 0.05) compared to 33.4
(2.9) cm in NON.
Twenty eight per cent of infants were examined for CNS/ANS
signs within 24 hours of life, 52% between 24 and 48 hours, and
12% between 48 and 72 hours. Mean (SD) postnatal age at
assessment was 36 (17) hours. Any CNS/ANS sign was detected
in 12% of those examined in the first 24 hours, and in 18%, 17%,

CNS/ANS signs in any cocaine or opiate exposure (EXP
compared to NON)
The prevalence of each of the CNS/ANS signs detected in EXP
ranged from 0.1% to 16.6%. Signs such as abnormal posture,
sweating, hiccoughing, bradycardia, hyperthermia, and hypo-
thermia had prevalence of <0.5% in EXP
. Prevalence of hypoto-
nia, weak cry, lethargy, mottling, tachycardia, and nasal flaring
in EXP was between 1.1% and 2.7%. No gross CNS malforma-
tion was seen in EXP
. No infant was noted to have seizures dur-
ing masked assessment. However, on medical record review,
three infants (one in OP and two in OP+CO) had seizures as a
manifestation of drug withdrawal. Table 2 shows the signs
found to be statistically of higher proportion (p < 0.05) in EXP
and are summarised by estimated OR (95% CI). Of signs
significantly associated with drug exposure, the most prevalent
were CNS signs--that is, jitteriness/tremors and irritability
observed at rates of 16.6% and 14.9%, respectively. Hypertonia
and high pitched cry were observed in 3.2% and 4% of EXP
.
These CNS/ANS signs were also significantly interrelated as
shown in table 3. Thus an infant with jitteriness/tremors was
16.6 times more likely to manifest with hypertonia, 9.3 times
more likely to be irritable, 11.3 times more likely to have high
pitched cry, 5 times more likely to have nasal stuffiness, and 8.5
times more likely to have excessive suck.
In the multivariate analysis the signs hyperactivity, hyper-
alertness, and difficult to arouse were not included in the model
because few babies had these signs. Table 4 shows the results of
the multivariate analysis. This table shows the adjusted OR
(95% CI) for the outcome of manifesting the constellation or
syndrome of CNS/ANS outcomes and for each CNS/ANS sign
associated with being in the EXP group. Any drug exposure
(that is,EXP) was significantly associated with the constellation
of CNS/ANS outcomes, OR (95% CI): 2.34 (1.92 to 2.84),
p < 0.0001. EXP infants were two to three times more likely to
exhibit jitteriness/tremors, irritability, hypertonia, high pitched
cry, or difficult to console; they were also greater than four times
more likely to have excessive suck, and one and one half times
more likely to show poor suck and nasal stuffiness. We found
significant site differences, but GA, postnatal age at assessment,
race, gender, or sexually transmitted diseases did not signifi-
cantly influence CNS/ANS outcomes. Neither alcohol nor mari-
juana had effects on outcomes. However, smoking had an inde-
pendent effect on the syndrome of CNS/ANS outcomes. Odds
ratios (95% CI) for manifesting the constellation of CNS/ANS
signs when a mother smoked less than half a pack a day, and
half a pack or more a day were, respectively, 1.2 (0.99 to 1.45),
p < 0.07 and 1.4 (1.2 to 1.6), p < 0.0002.
CNS/ANS signs in confirmed CO and OP exposure
Table 2 also shows the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in
confirmed CO only, OP only, and OP+CO exposure. In CO,
jitteriness/tremors and irritability were at rates of 14.6% and
12.2%, respectively. All other signs occurred in less than 5% of
babies. The presence of at least one sign, however, occurred in
28.2% of infants with CO only exposure. In OP, prevalence of
most of the CNS/ANS signs was higher than observed in CO.
Jitteriness/tremors and irritability were manifested in 22%
and 24%, respectively, of OP infants. Any >1 sign was
observed in 44.8% of those with confirmed exposure to OP
only and in 62% of those exposed to OP+CO. Except for diffi-
cult to arouse, the prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in OP+CO
exposure increased above those observed in OP or CO infants.
Difficult to arouse was a sign significant only in CO infants.
After controlling for confounders, CO and OP exposed infants
were more likely than NON to manifest the constellation of
CNS/ANS signs with OR (95% CI), respectively, of 1.7 (1.4 to
2.2), p <0.0001 and 2.8 (2.1 to 3.7), p < 0.0001. We found no

interaction between cocaine and opiate use. With CO and OP
having independent effects, exposure to OP+CO increased the
risk for CNS/ANS manifestations, OR (95% CI) of 4.8 (2.9 to
7.9), p < 0.0001. Of outcomes analysed, we found each of the
CNS signs, jitteriness/tremors, irritability, hypertonia, difficult
to console, and high pitched cry to be highly associated with
exposure, whether this be CO or OP or both.
The signs, poor suck, nasal stuffiness, and sneezing individu-
ally were not significantly associated with either CO or OP after
controlling for confounders. It must be stressed, however, that
these signs were significantly related to signs found to be indi-
vidually significant and were in the model as components of the
syndrome or constellation of CNS/ANS outcomes, the overall
outcome tested for cocaine and opiate effects.
With confirmed CO and OP exposure in the model, the
other variables with significant effects on outcome were clini-
cal site and smoking. The OR (95% CI) for manifesting the
constellation of the CNS/ANS outcomes with smoking less
than half a pack of cigarettes a day, and half a pack or more a
day were, respectively, 1.27 (1.04 to 1.55), p < 0.02 and 1.4
(1.20 to 1.60), p < 0.0003. No other factors were significantly
associated with CNS/ANS outcomes.
DISCUSSION
Clinicians evaluate neonates for withdrawal manifestations
through routine physical and neurological examination or by
Finnegan's Neonatal Abstinence Scoring System,30 especially
when progression and severity of manifestations are being
assessed. Other studies have used the Neonatal Withdrawal
Inventory,36 the Brazelton's Neonatal Behavior Assessment
Scales (NBAS),21 or the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale
(NNNS),31 with measures derived from the NBAS, but
modified specifically to evaluate drug exposed infants and
other high risk populations. Although we evaluated enrolled
infants for CNS/ANS signs described in Finnegan's Neonatal
Abstinence Scoring System,30 no attempt was made to obtain
abstinence scores. It was our main intent at the onset to
establish whether these signs would even be evident among
exposed infants, especially with an evaluation performed
masked to infants' exposure status. Furthermore, enrolment
of a large number of term infants and early discharge practice
in participating centres precluded repeated assessment and
use of a more intensive evaluation such as the NBAS.19 20 37
We found a low prevalence of CNS/ANS signs but
significantly higher in the EXP group, which included a large
number of cocaine exposed infants. The prevalence of signs
was almost double in opiate only exposure but lower than
reported rates in heroin5 6 38 39 and methadone exposure.6­8 40 41
Variation in reported incidence of CNS/ANS signs may be
related to different factors, such as dose, duration of addiction,
and time interval between last dose and delivery.38 39 42
However, our study was not designed specifically to investigate
the relation between CNS/ANS signs and these factors.
Lower overall prevalence of CNS/ANS signs in our study
may also be attributed to postnatal age at assessment of
infants enrolled. As onset of withdrawal signs correlates
inversely with time interval between last dose and delivery,3
we may have missed detection of CNS/ANS signs with onset at
later postnatal ages. Although we controlled for postnatal age
at assessment in our analysis, the short nursery stay of our
infants was a major limitation in detecting the true prevalence
of CNS/ANS signs following in utero drug exposure. Further-
more, onset of withdrawal manifestations, especially in
methadone exposure, may be delayed, as late as 4 weeks.9 Our
findings therefore are likely underestimates of the true preva-
lence of CNS/ANS signs following CO or OP exposure. In a full
term cohort, Tronick and colleagues43 found no neurobehav-
ioural effects of cocaine exposure at 2­3 days of age after con-
trolling for confounders. It was not until 3 weeks of age that
heavy exposure to cocaine was significantly associated with
poorer state regulation and greater excitability. Studies by
Chiriboga and colleagues22 23 44 showed high prevalence of
neurological abnormalities in cocaine exposed infants; their
infants were examined at later postnatal ages compared to our
infants. Coles and colleagues45 found little evidence of
"classic" withdrawal signs in cocaine exposed babies. Richard-
son and colleagues46 observed autonomic instability associated
with in utero cocaine exposure at 2 days postnatal age, regard-
less of trimester exposure, but findings were transient and
were not observed at age 3 days.
A review by Lester and colleagues47 highlighted the
conflicting reports on neonatal effects of in utero cocaine
exposure. In addition to variation in methods of assessment of
CNS/ANS signs, differences in observed effects among studies
may be attributed to small sample size, failure to control for
multiple variables, and variation in subject selection second-
ary to methods of identification of exposure and confirmation
of negative status among selected controls. Inaccuracy and
poor recall inherent in maternal self report of drug use,48 low
sensitivity and specificity of urine drug screening methods,49
and unmasked evaluation of infants might result in bias in
selection of study and comparison groups.50
We placed a major effort in our study design to improve on
weaknesses evident in previous studies. Our findings were
derived from a large sample. We also confirmed drug exposure
using GC/MS of meconium samples, a superior method to
urine RIA screening.49 Furthermore, to minimise bias, infants
enrolled were evaluated by research personnel masked to
infants' exposure status. In spite of a lower prevalence of CNS/
ANS signs than in other reports, we did find that cocaine
exposure was associated with increased likelihood of mani-
festing a constellation of CNS/ANS signs, an effect independ-
ent of opiate exposure.19 21 51­53 Infants with confirmed CO
exposure were more likely to have jitteriness/tremors,
irritability, hypertonia, high pitched cry, and were difficult to
console, findings consistent with the reports by Chiriboga and
colleagues22 23 44 and Tsay and colleagues.54
The variable fetal or neonatal effects of cocaine may be
explained by pharmacological factors39 51­57: individual differ-
ences in drug metabolism, high potential for cocaine in
traversing biological membranes but with slow tissue bio-
transformation, variability in plasma elimination half life, the
potency and unpredictable vascular effects of both active and
inactive cocaine metabolites, and variability of cocaine effects
on receptor densities or binding. Signs in cocaine exposed
babies may be secondary effects--that is, resulting from
hypoxaemia, growth retardation, and/or poor nutrition,56­58 as
a result of the vasoconstrictive effect of cocaine on placental
vessels, and thus the unpredictability of correlation between
plasma cocaine concentration and prevalence or severity of
withdrawal manifestations. Of interest is the reported
dose­response effect of cocaine on neonatal neurobehavioural
performance59; amount of cocaine use was carefully deduced
from maternal self report.59 A dose­response effect of cocaine
exposure on neurological findings was also reported in infants
>36 weeks gestation.44 Higher likelihood of hypertonia
occurred with higher levels of cocaine detected by RIA in
maternal hair.44 We were unable to address dose­exposure
effect of cocaine at this phase of the study, but a subpopulation
is enrolled in long term developmental follow up, with
planned neurobehavioural evaluation at 42­45 weeks post-
conceptional age and a detailed maternal interview of drug
use. This may permit exploration of relations between
CNS/ANS manifestations and dose.
Maternal polydrug use has been reported to result in more
frequent and more severe neonatal withdrawal signs than
single drug use.35 46 60 61 Mayes and Carroll62 observed higher
withdrawal scores in infants exposed to both cocaine and
methadone compared to those with no added exposure to
cocaine. In our study, the effects of exposure to the combina-
tion of opiate and cocaine were additive. In animal studies,

cocaine increases opiate receptor binding, therefore enhancing
opiate effects.63 64 Thus, in maternal opiate plus cocaine abuse,
disappearance of opiates after birth may increase the
likelihood of development of neonatal withdrawal manifesta-
tions than with exposure to opiate only. Furthermore, the
combined effects of opiate and cocaine on the upregulation of
cAMP have been associated with increase in glutaminergic
and noradrenergic responses.64 Increased glutaminergic activ-
ity may explain observed manifestations such as irritability,
excitability, or tremors after cocaine or opiate exposure.
Dempsey and colleagues65 observed that tone abnormalities
are predicted by neonatal urine cotinine levels rather than con-
centrations of cocaine metabolites in meconium and urine. Pre-
natal exposure to cigarettes has been associated with measur-
able neurobehavioural effects.66 Studies have also alluded to the
resemblance between cocaine and nicotine effects.67 We found a
significant association between smoking and CNS/ANS out-
comes independent of drug effects. As a large proportion of
women who use cocaine also smoke during pregnancy, future
studies will need to evaluate neonatal and long term effects in
the context of exposure to both substances.
In summary, the large number of exposed infants in our study
has enabled us to discriminate effects related to cocaine from
those of opiates, while taking into consideration multiple
confounding variables. In utero cocaine exposure is significantly
associated with manifesting a constellation of CNS/ANS out-
comes. CNS signs are the more prevalent manifestations, but
these are significantly interrelated to one another and to ANS
signs. These manifestations are similar to signs of opiate
withdrawal. However, it remains unclear whether these signs
associated with cocaine exposure are withdrawal signs or rather
manifestations of toxic effects of cocaine on the developing fetal
brain. Perhaps, exploring any relation between these manifesta-
tions and early gestational cocaine exposure as detected by neo-
natal hair analysis68 may help assess whether these signs relate to
withdrawal or drug effects. Furthermore, long term follow up of
these children will be needed to determine the prognostic signifi-
cance of these early CNS signs. The association between cocaine
exposure and CNS/ANS outcomes, the additive effects associated
with exposure to both cocaine and opiate, the reported subacute
manifestations in narcotic withdrawal, and possibility of late
onset manifestations in either cocaine and opiates exposure must
prompt primary care providers for early and frequent post-
discharge health monitoring of these high risk infants.
