Objective. Building on prior work linking high anger expression to poor health, this cross-sectional study addressed
whether anger expression exacerbated age-related risk for metabolic syndrome in a national sample of adults, known as
MIDUS (Midlife in the United States).
Method. Respondents reported anger expression via survey assessments and completed an overnight clinic visit.
Results.Unadjusted metabolic syndrome prevalence was 40.6%. Men, less educated individuals, and those who
reported not getting regular physical activity were at significantly higher risk for metabolic syndrome. Anger expression
did not predict higher risk for metabolic syndrome in main effects models, but it moderated the relationship between age
and metabolic syndrome. Age-associated risk for metabolic syndrome was significant only for adults with high anger
expression.
Discussion. Among older adults, anger expression predicted higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Older adults
reporting low anger expression had metabolic syndrome rates comparable to younger adults. Results highlight that failing
to show the frequently observed decline in anger expression with age may have pernicious health concomitants.
Key Words: Anger expression--Emotion regulation--Life course or developmental change--Metabolic syndrome.
Emotional well-being is generally preserved or
improved with age. Cross-sectional and longitudinal
research shows fewer negative emotions with age, whereas
positive emotions are maintained or increased (Carstensen
et al., 2011; Stone, Schwartz, Broderick, & Deaton, 2010).
Older adults report fewer experiences and expressions of
anger and greater anger control compared with younger
adults (Phillips, Henry, Hosie, & Milne, 2006; Schieman,
1999, 2010). Between-age-group comparisons do not,
however, capture important individual differences in anger
among older persons. This study addressed variability
among older adults in the link between anger and later
life health risks, an important question given that aging
is known to increase risk for diabetes and cardiovascular
diseases (Berry et al., 2012; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2011). The central question was whether
older adults who fail to show the lower levels of anger doc-
umented in prior research have greater risk for metabolic
syndrome, a known cardiovascular risk factor.
Our formulation draws on the strength and vulnerability
integration (SAVI) model, which postulates that the advan-
tages in emotional well-being with age may be attenuated, or
eliminated, under conditions of elevated arousal, given that
older adults have reduced physiological flexibility (Charles,
2010). The model adds that physiological reactivity from
stressors, including emotional stressors, may increase car-
diovascular health risks due to frequent arousal accompanied
by a loss of physiological resilience with older age. Anger
is understudied in this context, even though it is a prototypi-
cal high arousal negative emotion associated with heightened
physiological reactivity (Levenson, 1992). As a test of the
SAVI model, we hypothesized that older adults who reported
greater anger expression, believed to be accompanied by
more frequent physiological reactivity, would be at higher
risk for metabolic syndrome than older adults who show the
more typical pattern of better emotional experience and regu-
lation, defined here in terms of lower anger expression.
Many factors may contribute to heightened anger among
older adults. For example, greater susceptibility to poor
health, financial strain, role loss, and spousal loss are
all chronic stressors faced in middle and old age (Scott,
Whitehead, Bergeman, & Pitzer, 2013). Older adults with
greater chronic disease burden and lower self-rated health
demonstrated less healthy personality profiles, including
higher neuroticism and lower conscientiousness, which may
also be accompanied by high anger (Sutin, Zonderman,
Ferrucci, & Terracciano, 2013; Turiano et al., 2012).A recent
study demonstrated that experiencing negative social interac-
tions, defined as interactions causing irritation, frustration, or
annoyance, all key components of anger, was more strongly
related to negative affect in middle-aged and older adults
compared with younger adults (Birditt, 2013). This sug-
gests that when negative interactions occur, older adults are
affected more negatively by them. Together, these findings

highlight variability in anger among older adults, and the cur-
rent study examines the health correlates of such a profile.
Anger expression has well-established ties to cardio-
vascular and metabolic disease (Chida & Steptoe, 2009;
Everson et al., 1999; Schum, Jorgensen, Verhaeghen, Sauro,
& Thibodeau, 2003). Long-standing interest in the cardio-
toxic effects of expressing anger dates back to a 1896 pub-
lication entitled "The Physiologic Effects of the Indulgence
in Anger" (JAMA, 1896). Further, prospective and cross-
sectional research showing that greater anger expression
and related constructs like hostility predict increased risk
of metabolic syndrome (Cohen, Panguluri, Na, & Whooley,
2010; Elovainio et al., 2011; Goldbacher & Matthews,
2007), although some studies failed to find an association
(Mommersteeg & Pouwer, 2012).
Metabolic syndrome is a constellation of risk factors,
including central obesity, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia,
and hypertension, associated with increased risk for coro-
nary heart disease, Type II diabetes, functional limitations,
and mortality (Alberti, Zimmet, & Shaw, 2006; Beavers
et al., 2013; Cornier et al., 2008; Ford, 2005). Data from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003­
2006 indicated the unadjusted prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome was 34.4% and identified age as a key risk factor.
The prevalence among adults aged 20­39 was 20.3%, in
contrast to 51.5% of adults aged 60 and older (Ervin, 2009;
Yang & Kozloski, 2011).
Using data from a national sample of adults known as
MIDUS (Midlife in the United States), we first examined
cross-sectional age differences in anger expression and
metabolic syndrome prevalence, predicting anger expres-
sion would be lower and metabolic syndrome prevalence
would be greater among older adults. Second, we tested
associations between anger expression and metabolic syn-
drome. The targeted question, however, was whether indi-
vidual differences in anger expression would moderate the
relationship between age and metabolic syndrome, testing
the hypothesis that greater anger expression heightens age-
related risk for metabolic syndrome.
Method
MIDUS began in 1995 with more than 7,000 noninsti-
tutionalized adults recruited through random digit dial-
ing (RDD) from the 48 contiguous states. The sample
included siblings from some RDD respondents as well as
some twins (Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004; Radler & Ryff,
2010). The second wave (MIDUS II) began in 2004 with
a 75% retention rate. Biological data were collected from
a subset of respondents (N = 1,255) who traveled to one
of three General Clinical Research Centers (GCRCs) for
an overnight clinic visit. There was a 43% response rate,
reflective of the demanding protocol and extensive travel
required for many participants (Love, Seeman, Weinstein,
& Ryff, 2010). The biological subsample was comparable
with the full MIDUS II sample on most demographic and
health characteristics, though was better educated and less
likely to smoke than nonparticipants (Love et al., 2010).
This study was approved by Institutional Review Boards
at Georgetown University, University of California, Los
Angeles, and University of Wisconsin­Madison. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.
Anger Expression
Anger expression was assessed using the anger-out
subscale from Spielberger's State-Trait Anger Expression
Inventory (Spielberger, 1996). Participants completed the
inventory at the clinic, indicating how often (1 = almost
never; 4 = almost always) they expressed their anger out-
wardly when they felt angry or furious. The scale contained
eight items, and internal consistency was 0.77.
Metabolic Syndrome
Metabolic syndrome was defined by the International
Diabetes Federation definition (Alberti et al., 2006).
Participants were classified as meeting metabolic syndrome
criteria when they had central obesity and at least two out
of the following risk factors: triglycerides (150
mg/dL),
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<40mg/dL in men or
<50
mg/dL in women), blood pressure (130
mm Hg sys-
tolic or 85mm Hg diastolic), and high fasting plasma glu-
cose (100
mg/dL or Type II diabetes diagnosis). For the
classification of central obesity, waist circumference cutoffs
were greater than or equal to 94cm for men and greater than
or equal to 80
cm for women, measured at the narrowest
point between the ribs and iliac crest by GCRC staff. Blood
pressure was assessed in a seated position 3 times consecu-
tively with a 30-s interval between each measurement. The
two most similar readings were averaged. The lipid panel
and glucose were assessed from a fasting blood sample
taken on the morning of the second day of the GCRC visit
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
Covariates
Control variables included gender, educational attain-
ment, race (coded to reflect white or black/African
American), current smoking status, alcohol consumption
over the previous month, regular physical activity (at least
20min 3 or more times per week), and chronic conditions
(sum of those experienced or treated within the previous
12 months, such as diabetes, stroke, and hypertension).
Results
Table 1 provides sample descriptive information as well
as bivariate correlations. Unadjusted metabolic syndrome
prevalence was 40.6%. Older adults were more likely to
be white/Caucasian and less likely to smoke. Age was
related to less frequent anger expressions, lower alcohol

consumption, greater waist circumference, higher sys-
tolic blood pressure, lower diastolic blood pressure, and
greater likelihood of having metabolic syndrome in bivar-
iate analyses. When age was stratified into tertiles, there
were significant age differences in anger expression such
that each age tertile reported significantly lower anger
expression than the younger tertiles, F(2,1199) = 23.99,
p < .001.
Standardized age and anger expression were entered
as predictors of metabolic syndrome diagnostic status in
the first step of a logistic regression analysis, controlling
for demographic factors and health covariates. An inter-
action between age and anger expression was entered
in the next step. Results are presented in Table 2. Men
(Wald = 32.35, p < .001), those with less educational attain-
ment (Wald = 8.06, p < .01), more chronic conditions
(Wald = 15.34, p < .001), and not being physically active
(Wald = 6.28, p = .01) were at significantly higher risk
for metabolic syndrome. Anger expression did not predict
metabolic syndrome (Wald = 0.02, p = .88). However, the
interaction between age and anger expression was signifi-
cant, Wald = 4.23, p = .04. Because men were at higher risk

Boylan and Ryff
for metabolic syndrome (Yang & Kozloski, 2011), and prior
research has shown that the extent to which anger expres-
sion predicts cardiovascular outcomes is stronger in men
(Chida & Steptoe, 2009), we tested gender by anger and
gender by education by anger interactions. Neither interac-
tion was significant, suggesting that the reported findings
are not driven by males.
To assess the nature of the obtained interaction, we
examined simple slopes reflecting the relationship between
age and metabolic syndrome at three levels of anger expres-
sion: at 1 SD below the mean, at the mean level, and at 1
SD above the mean. Adjusting for all covariates, the rela-
tionship between age and metabolic syndrome was only
significant at high levels of anger expression (B = 0.23,
Wald = 5.22, p = .02). Age and metabolic syndrome were
not significantly related at average (B = 0.09, Wald = 1.83,
p = .18) and low levels of anger expression (B = -0.05,
Wald = 0.31, p = .58). These simple slopes are graphed in
Figure 1, where the y-axis reflects the predicted probabili-
ties of meeting metabolic syndrome criteria for each partici-
pant based on the final regression model, which adjusted for
covariates (Jaccard, 2001).
Supplemental Analyses
Because the MIDUS includes siblings and twins of the
RDD sample, assumptions of independent observations
are violated. To address these dependencies, mixed effects
models with random intercepts for family clusters were used
to rerun analyses. All conclusions drawn from the mixed
effects models are unchanged from those reported earlier.
Discussion
Aging involves juxtapositions between gains and losses.
On the one hand, physical health tends to decline, but emo-
tional well-being may hold steady or improve. We predicted
that older adults who did not show the typical pattern of
downregulation in anger expression would be at greater risk
for metabolic syndrome. As hypothesized, greater anger
expression (i.e., being more likely to express anger out-
wardly when anger is felt) was associated with an increased
probability of having metabolic syndrome among older
adults. The pattern of effects was apparent, though weaker,
among middle-aged adults, and not apparent at all, among
the younger adults. Importantly, older adults reporting low
anger expression did not exhibit the expected age-related
increase in risk for metabolic syndrome and instead dem-
onstrated comparable risk to their younger counterparts.
Nonsignificant interactions with gender suggest that these
findings were consistent in both men and women.
The findings support the SAVI model, which suggests
that age-related advantages in emotional well-being may be
attenuated or even eliminated when physiological vulnera-
bilities are at play under situations of high arousal (Charles,
2010). Anger is a high arousal negative emotion associ-
ated with physiological reactivity (Levenson, 1992); high
anger also predicts increased risk for cardiovascular and
metabolic disease in prospective research (Chida & Steptoe,
2009; Everson et al., 1999; Goldbacher & Matthews, 2007;
Schum et al., 2003). On average, older adults experience
and express anger less frequently than younger adults
(Schieman, 1999, 2010; Stone et al., 2010), suggesting
that some may learn more effective strategies to regulate
Figure 1.Predicted probability of metabolic syndrome by age and anger expression. The lines represent the simple slopes for age and metabolic syndrome

relationship at different levels of anger. Low anger reflects less than 1 SD from the mean, and high anger reflects greater than 1 SD from the mean. Only the simple
slope between age and metabolic syndrome at high anger expression was significant.

their emotions with age and rely less on strategies that have
negative consequences (John & Gross, 2004; Scheibe &
Carstensen, 2010). Indeed, we found a significant negative
relationship between age and anger expression in our sam-
ple. As SAVI theorizes, however, our results highlight that
older adults who failed to show the typical decline in anger
with age are at increased risk for metabolic syndrome com-
pared with same-aged adults reporting fewer expressions
of anger.
A key assumption behind this formulation is that more
frequent physiological arousal underlies increased rates of
metabolic syndrome among older adults with high anger.
Due to reduced flexibility in biological systems with age,
physical health may be negatively affected by the increased
arousal. Although not explicitly measured in our study,
research in other domains lends credence to this perspec-
tive. Middle-aged adults who reported greater anger in
response to a laboratory stressor exhibited greater pro-
duction of proinflammatory cytokines during a laboratory
stressor (Carroll et al., 2011). Adults who displayed more
negative behavior during a marital conflict in the laboratory
also showed greater endocrine activation and poorer immu-
nological health in response to the conflict (Kiecolt-Glaser
et al., 1997). Whether such profiles of high anger and asso-
ciated exaggerated physiological reactivity in the labora-
tory prospectively predict disease is an important avenue
for future research.
Several caveats should be noted. Limited representation
of racial and ethnic minority group members precludes
generalizing results to other racial/ethnic groups, where
anger may be experienced to a greater extent (Barefoot
et al., 1991). The cross-sectional nature of this research
does not allow the direction of effects to be resolved; lon-
gitudinal data are needed to establish temporal precedence
among anger and metabolic syndrome. However, we found
that changes in self-rated health over a 10-year time span
were unrelated to anger expression (data not shown), which
somewhat reduces concern of reverse causation (i.e., that
poor health leads to increased anger expression among
older adults).
Despite these limitations, a strength of this report was
the integration of a well-established risk factor for poor
metabolic health (i.e., age) with a core aspect of emotional
experience, the tendency to outwardly express anger. We
demonstrated that both are important for understanding
metabolic risk associated with aging. Specifically, older
adults who expressed their anger outwardly had the high-
est health risks, whereas older adults who reported fewer
anger expressions exhibited comparable probabilities of
metabolic syndrome to adults several decades younger. An
important implication of the findings is whether anger man-
agement strategies might be useful for older adults prone to
outwardly express their anger, with possible prophylactic
implications for metabolic syndrome and subsequent car-
diovascular disease.
