to Measure Functional Disability

Measures of functional disability typically contain items that reflect limitations in performing activities of daily liv-
ing (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Combining IADL and ADL items together in the same
scale would provide enhanced range and sensitivity of measurement. This article presents psychometric justification
for a combined ADUIADL scale. Data come from 2,977 disabled respondents in the 1989 National Long-Term Care
Survey. Respondents indicated whether they received human help on 7 ADL items; they also indicated whether they
were unable to perform each of 9 IADL items due to health reasons. Factor analyses using tetrachoric correlations
demonstrated that 15 of the 16 items reflected one major dimension. Item response theory (IRT) methods were used
to calibrate the items; a one-parameter IRT model fit the data. Item calibrations showed that ADL and IADL items
were not hierarchically related. Analyses showed that a simple sum of item responses could be used to derive a mea-
sure of functional disability. Implications of using a 15-item ADUIADL scale for eligibility determination and for
comparing groups are discussed.
STUDIES of health status and quality of life, especially
studies of elderly persons, frequently assess functional
disability. Measures of functional disability play a key role
in studies of the aging process, in clinical decision making,
in evaluating the outcomes of treatment, in determining eli-
gibility for certain services, and in estimating the preva-
lence of service needs. Nagi's (1965) model provides a
conceptual foundation for the development of measures of
functional disability. This framework makes important dis-
tinctions between impairments, functional limitations, and
disability. Impairments are anatomical, physical, or mental
abnormalities or losses in one physical system, such as a
missing limb or brain damage; functional limitations refer
to performance at the level of the whole organism, such as
reaching or walking. Disability refers to limitations in per-
formance of social roles and tasks in the context of the
socio-cultural and physical environment. In this frame-
work, disability refers to the social result of the interaction
between disease, impairments, and functional limitations
(Nagi, 1965, 1976). For example, whereas difficulty reach-
ing is a functional limitation, it may or may not lead to a
problem with any activity, such as dressing or preparing
meals. In contrast, difficulty or needing help with bathing is
a disability because bathing is an important activity, such
that failure to perform this activity may have negative im-
plications for personal health and for the performance of
important social roles.
The concept of functional disability distinguishes basic
daily activities that are necessary to function personally
and in the community from other major social roles, such
as work disability or social interactions (Nagi, 1965, 1976).
Functional disability refers to limitations in performing in-
dependent living tasks, which are often further divided into
activities of daily living (ADLs), which include basic activ-
ities of hygiene and personal care, and instrumental activi-
ties of daily living (IADLs), which include basic activities
necessary to reside in the community, such as shopping,
managing finances, housekeeping, and meal preparation
(Katz et al., 1963; Lawton & Brody, 1969; Nagi, 1965;
Spector, 1996; Verbrugge & Jette, 1994).
Many more elderly persons have disabilities in IADLs
than ADLs. Although only about 2 million elderly persons
are disabled in ADLs, approximately 4.1 million are dis-
abled either in IADLs or ADLs (Stone & Murtaugh, 1990).
When measuring functional disability, for some purposes it
is desirable to include both ADL and IADL items. By in-
cluding both types of activities a greater range of disability
can be measured. This article addresses the issues of
whether and how IADL and ADL items should be com-
bined to yield an overall measure of functional disability.
Different approaches for measuring functional disability
vary in the manner in which they combine IADL and ADL
items. One common approach is to maintain separate mea-
sures of ADLs and IADLs (e.g., Jette et al., 1987; Stern,
1995; Sloane, Hoerger, & Picone, 1996), treating them as
distinct constructs. A second common approach is to in-
clude information on IADL disability only for those individ-
uals without any ADL disability (e.g., Airman & Walden,
1993; Laforge, Spector, & Sternberg, 1992; Tennstedt,
Crawford, & McKinlay, 1993; Spector & Kemper, 1994).
This approach treats ADLs and IADLs as one construct, and
thus simplifies the measurement of functional disability by
providing a summary score. By including IADL informa-
tion for those without ADL disability, the second approach
S46
FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY S47
extends the range of disability measurement and avoids a
narrow focus on only severe functional disability. But it ig-
nores information about IADLs among those with ADL dis-
ability. Both approaches avoid combining ADL and IADL
information for each respondent, regardless of ADL status.
A third approach, which is considered in this article, is to
develop a functional disability score that synthesizes all in-
formation about ADL and IADL disabilities for each re-
spondent in a psychometrically appropriate manner.
Combining ADL and IADL items into one measure re-
quires (a) determining if the measure is unidimensional,
and (b) determining how to combine responses to several
questions into an aggregate score. With regard to the first
issue, if separate questions measure different constructs,
combining responses into an overall score is misleading
and inappropriate. With regard to the second issue, unjusti-
fied protocols for combining responses to multiple items
may result in incorrect inferences about the relative disabil-
ity of individuals or groups. This article examines the legiti-
macy of and the proper procedure for combining ADLs and
IADLs, using factor analysis and item response theory
(Muthen, 1978; Baker, 1992).
Dimensionality. -- Controversy exists over whether
functional disability is a unidimensional or multidimen-
sional construct. If it is unidimensional, then ADLs and
IADLs can be combined into one scale and a single score
can describe a unique level of disability. If, on the other
hand, it is multidimensional, a set of measures is necessary
to provide a functional disability profile for an individual.
Lawton and Brody (1969) suggested that IADLs require "a
greater complexity of neuropsychological organization"
than ADLs. However, they did not explicitly consider
IADLs as a dimension distinct from ADLs. They observed
that, although IADL tasks were typically more complex
than ADLs, some overlap in degree of complexity between
ADLs and IADLs was possible.
Subsequent research addressing the issue of dimensional-
ity is diverse and results are inconsistent. Some studies sug-
gest that functional disability is multidimensional and have
found three or four separate constructs (Clark, Stump, &
Wolinsky, 1997; Fitzgerald et al., 1993; Wolinsky & John-
son, 1991). Other studies argue that ADLs and IADLs com-
prise only one dimension (Kempen & Suurmeijer, 1990;
Spector et al., 1987; Suurmeijer et al., 1994). These differ-
ent conclusions may result from differences in the specific
items used, and from variation in the methods used to deter-
mine dimensionality.
The set of items analyzed in prior studies often includes
a mixture of items measuring impairments, functional limi-
tations, and functional disabilities. Analyzing items reflect-
ing multiple constructs may affect the number of dimen-
sions ascertained. For example, some studies include items
concerning bowel and bladder incontinence (Jagger, Clarke,
& Davies, 1986; Linacre et al., 1994); these items often
comprise a separate dimension in factor analyses. Incon-
tinence is often measured in terms of bowel or bladder
control, reflecting an abnormality in a particular physical
system; phrased in this manner, such items measure impair-
ments, not a functional disability. Other studies combine
functional disabilities with functional limitations, such as
walking up stairs or upper or lower body limitations (e.g.,
bending and reaching; Clark et al., 1997; Haley, McHorney,
& Ware, 1994; Jette, 1980; Linacre et al., 1994; Wolinsky
& Johnson, 1991). Few studies have focused on a core set
of ADL and IADL activities when assessing dimensionality
(Clark et al., 1997; Fitzgerald et al., 1993).
Prior studies have typically used factor analysis or prin-
cipal components analysis to determine dimensionality, al-
though the decision rules and methods have varied (Fitz-
gerald et al., 1993; Wolinsky & Johnson, 1991). One reason
for conflicting results may be that some studies factor ana-
lyze dichotomous variables, indicating presence or absence
of a limitation for a particular task. Standard factor analysis
methods using Pearson correlation coefficients, however, are
not appropriate when variables are discrete or highly skewed
(Rummel, 1970; Muthen, 1988). Artifactual "difficulty" fac-
tors may appear as a result of items with similar degrees of
skewness loading together. Results may therefore be sensi-
tive to the distribution of responses to the items. In addition,
the magnitude of Pearson correlations between dichotomous
items may have an upper limit less than 1, depending on the
relative skewness of both variables.
When factor analyzing dichotomous variables, a recom-
mended approach is to use tetrachoric correlations. Tetra-
choric correlations assume that observed dichotomous vari-
ables represent unobserved continuous variables with a
bivariate normal distribution; the tetrachoric correlation es-
timates the relationship between these latent continuous
variables. The range of tetrachoric correlations is not con-
strained by disparate and skewed marginal distributions of
observed variables. In this study, we perform factor analy-
ses of dichotomous variables measuring functional disabili-
ties (i.e., ADLs and IADLs) using tetrachoric correlations
and the statistically appropriate generalized least squares
estimation procedure (Muthen, 1978, 1988).
Scaling procedures: IRT models. -- After the issue of di-
mensionality has been resolved, the researcher must con-
sider the psychometrically appropriate procedure for com-
bining items into multi-item scales. Item response theory
(IRT) provides a sophisticated framework for developing
measurement scales and calibrating individual items within
a scale. For many years, IRT has been used to develop edu-
cational and psychological tests (Lord, 1980). Only re-
cently has IRT been applied to assess health status mea-
sures (Haley, McHorney, & Ware, 1994; Granger et al.,
1993; Linacre et al., 1994; Silverstein et al., 1992; Teresi,
Cross, & Golden, 1989). Previous research applying IRT
methods to assess disability has analyzed heterogeneous
sets of items that combine ADLs, IADLs, impairments, and
functional limitations; the present research applies IRT
methods to a standard set of IADL and ADL items.
As applied to functional disability, IRT assumes that
there exists an unobserved (latent) continuous dimension of
disability, symbolized by 0, and that each individual can be
placed along this dimension at a point that reflects the
extent of his or her functional disability. IRT estimates item
characteristic curves (ICCs) for each item. The ICC shows
the probability of a positive response on a specific dichoto-
S48 SPECTORAND FLEISHMAN
mous item as a function of the latent disability level 6. In
the present context, the ICC shows how the probability of
reporting a specific ADL or IADL disability varies, depend-
ing on one's underlying level of disability. (Figure 1 shows
four different ICCs.)
IRT offers several advantages over classical psychomet-
ric approaches. First, classical item statistics, such as the
proportion answering an item correctly or the item-total
correlation, depend on the composition of the sample and
the specific combination of items used. Classical item
statistics are typically based on correlations, which are af-
fected by the variances of the variables. In contrast, IRT
item parameter estimates are invariant (within a linear
transformation) to the population distribution of the trait
being measured, analogous to regression coefficients (Ham-
bleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991). Second, the IRT
model is nonlinear, with an S-shaped ICC. In the analysis
of dichotomous variables, nonlinear models have several
advantages that make them more attractive than the linear
model of classical test theory (Waller et al., 1996). Third,
IRT provides an estimate of reliability for each item. Unlike
classical test theory, which assumes that the scale's reliabil-
ity is constant for all respondents regardless of 6, in IRT an
item's reliability is not constant but varies, depending on 0.
IRT thereby provides a mechanism for selecting items to
measure a specific level of 9 most accurately. Fourth, IRT
provides a framework for assessing item bias.
The shape of the ICC is determined by two item parame-
ters (3, and a, where "i" refers to different items. Items may
vary in their parameters, and their ICCs will have different
shapes. (3,, the location parameter, represents the point
on the latent dimension that corresponds to a .5 probability
of a positive response to the item (in a two-parameter
IRT model). A high value of (3, implies that a high probabil-
ity of making a positive response to the item will be
predominantly limited to individuals with high values of
0. a, indexes the discrimination ability of the item (the
slope of the curve). The greater the value of this param-
eter, the more sharply the item discriminates among indi-
viduals with different values of 0 (at the point of inflection
of the ICC). This parameter is roughly analogous to a factor
loading in factor analysis; the greater the magnitude, the
greater the degree to which responses are affected by the la-
tent variable. (3, reflects the point along the range of 0
where the item discriminates best. Each item provides in-
formation about 0 over the entire range of disability, but the
amount of information varies across the range of 0, and the
maximum information occurs at the value of the location
parameter (Lord, 1980). Thus, one item may provide infor-
mation about relatively mild levels of disability, whereas
0.9 _

FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY S49
another item may discriminate best at severe levels of dis-
ability. IRT provides estimates of the (3, and a parameters
for each item.
Descriptions of the IRT model typically refer to the loca-
tion parameter ((3,) as the item's "difficulty." The greater the
magnitude of this parameter, the lower the proportion of
people who answer positively. In the familiar context of
IRT modeling -- educational testing -- estimates of ability
are derived. In the gerontological literature, interest focuses
on disability. We have chosen to be consistent with this lit-
erature and scale the items to measure disability. To avoid
confusing double negatives, we refer to the item's "loca-
tion," instead of its "difficulty."
One- and two-parameter IRT models must be distin-
guished. In the one-parameter model, all items have equal
slopes (a,), and the ICCs for all items are parallel. With a
one-parameter model the location parameter establishes an
unequivocal order of the items. In the two-parameter
model, a, varies across items, and the ICCs may cross each
other. In Figure 1, ICCs 1, 3, and 4 have the same slope,
whereas the slope is different for Item 2. The probability of
a positive response to Item 1 is higher than Item 2 at some
levels of disability and lower at other levels.
The number of parameters in the IRT model has signifi-
cant implications for estimating each person's latent dis-
ability level, 8y. In a one-parameter model, the estimated
disability score for an individual depends only on the num-
ber of items that person answers positively. For example, all
persons with four positive responses to a set of items re-
ceive the same estimated disability score, regardless of the
particular items each person answered positively. In con-
trast, with a two-parameter model the score depends on the
particular pattern of responses as well as the number of
items answered positively.
The goals of this article are to assess the dimensionality
of ADLs and IADLs and to use IRT methods to estimate
disability scores for individuals. Several studies applying
the IRT methodology have assumed a one-parameter model
without testing to see if it is appropriate (Haley, McHorney,
& Ware, 1994; Heinemann et al., 1993). We explicitly com-
pare the one- and two-parameter IRT models. We discuss
the implications for research and for using functional dis-
ability measures to determine program eligibility.
METHODS
Data
Data are from the 1989 National Long-Term Care Survey
(NLTCS; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993). This survey
was designed to serve two purposes: (a) to provide a nation-
ally representative cross-sectional sample of functionally
disabled persons in 1989, and (b) to link with the prior
1982 and 1984 surveys to provide estimates of change in
functional disability. The original (1982) sample was taken
from a Medicare enrollee frame provided by the Health
Care Financing Administration. Persons who were impaired
or institutionalized in 1982 and 1984 were automatically in-
cluded in the 1989 survey and provided data on ADL and
IADL problems. In addition, a screening process was used
in 1989: Persons defined as unimpaired from the 1982 and
1984 surveys, as well as a sample of Medicare enrollees who
turned age 65 between 1984 and 1988, were given a screen-
ing interview to determine if they had IADL or ADL prob-
lems that had lasted or were expected to last three months. A
total of 15,255 older adults (unweighted) completed screen-
ing interviews (Clark et al., 1997). Those with ADL or IADL
problems were eligible for the detailed 1989 survey, in addi-
tion to those with prior impairment or institutionalization. A
total of 4,463 people received the detailed interview.
Because the health status of a large number of disabled
persons actually improves, many of the 1982 and 1984 im-
paired or institutionalized group were not functionally dis-
abled in 1989. Of the 4,463 persons who were interviewed,
1,496 had no functional disabilities in 1989. To focus on a
cross sectional sample of functionally disabled persons, we
restricted the study sample to the 2,977 persons who were
functionally disabled in at least one of sixteen ADLs or
IADLs in 1989. This is a nationally representative sample
of elderly functionally disabled persons in the community.
Measuring ADL and IADL Disability
The screened-in sample was given a detailed interview
about demographic characteristics, health status, impair-
ments, disabilities, number of caregivers and amount of
ADL and IADL help received. Measures of functional dis-
ability included activities of daily living (Katz et al., 1963)
and instrumental activities of daily living (Lawton &
Brody, 1969). The survey measured seven ADLs (bathing,
dressing, getting around inside, transferring, toileting, in-
continence, and feeding) and nine IADLs (preparing meals,
doing housework, doing laundry, shopping, managing
money, taking medicines, telephoning, going places outside
of walking distance, and getting around outside). The refer-
ence period was the week prior to the interview. For ADLs,
a positive (disabled) response was defined as receipt of
human help to perform the task; human help included
standby as well as hands-on help. Use of special equipment
to perform a task, in the absence of human help, was coded
as nondisabled. This decision is consistent with a large
body of literature, beginning with Katz et al. (1963), that
distinguishes between dependence and independence. For
incontinence, a positive response was defined as receiving
human help with cleaning up accidents or with managing
a device, rather than bowel or bladder control per se; this
reflects a focus on ability to maintain hygiene after acci-
dents, rather than on propensity to have episodes of inconti-
nence. (By focusing on maintaining hygiene, this item rep-
resents a functional disability rather than an impairment,
and thus is conceptually consistent with the other functional
disability items.)
For IADLs, the interview asked whether the person usu-
ally performed the task, whether the person could perform
the task if necessary, and whether any inability was due to
health problems. Respondents were coded as disabled on
IADLs if they usually did not perform the task, could not
perform the task, and their disability resulted from a health
problem. In the survey, housework was defined as either
heavy (e.g., scrubbing floors) or light (e.g., straightening
up). However, persons were screened into the survey based
only on the light housework item. We limited consideration
S50 SPECTOR AND FLEISHMAN
to light housework because persons disabled only in heavy
housework were ineligible for the survey.
Estimation Procedures
The first phase of the analysis examined the dimensional-
ity of the 16 ADL and IADL items. As a cross-validation
procedure, the sample was split into halves, and analyses
were conducted separately for each half. In the first half,
exploratory factor analyses were conducted; in the second
half, confirmatory factor analyses were conducted. Both
analyses were based on the tetrachoric correlations among
the items, using the LISCOMP program (Muthen, 1988).
IRT analyses were performed using the BILOG-MG pro-
gram (Zimowski et al., 1996). BILOG-MG estimates the
item parameters by a marginal maximum likelihood proce-
dure; estimates of each person's latent disability score are
derived using a Bayesian (EAP: expectation a posteriori)
approach (Bock & Aitkin, 1981).
The analyses were limited to the subset of respondents
who had at least one "disabled" response to the initial set of
16 items; those who gave a "nondisabled" response to all
16 items were removed from the analyses. Ancillary analy-
ses were conducted, using the entire sample of 4,463, and
the ordering of items in terms of location parameters was
identical to that reported below. In fact, some IRT methods
cannot provide an estimate of 9 for people who answer all
items correctly or incorrectly, and these respondents are au-
tomatically removed from the analysis (Wright & Stone,
1979). (The EAP method can provide such an estimate,
however.) People who give a uniform response to all items
provide relatively little information concerning item param-
eters, and estimates of their 6 are relatively imprecise. If a
large proportion of people give uniform responses to all
items, this points out that the scale is not sensitive to varia-
tions outside of a specific range.
RESULTS
Sample
The study sample consists of functionally disabled per-
sons aged 65 and over in 1989. The mean age of the sample
was 79 years; 69% were women; 82% were White. Table 1
presents the frequency of positive responses (indicating dis-
ability) on each of the 16 IADL or ADL items. The propor-
tion of the sample indicating a positive response ranged
from 73% for "going places outside of walking distance" to
14% for "help with incontinence." Generally, IADL items
had the highest proportions with a positive response, and
ADL items typically had the lowest. However, there were
two anomalies: "bathing," an ADL, had the fourth highest
proportion with a positive response, and "telephoning," an
IADL, had the third lowest.
Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses
Exploratory factor analyses of the tetrachoric correlations
for the first half of the sample (n = 1,489) revealed that the
first eigenvalue was substantially greater in magnitude than
the remaining eigenvalues. The first three eigenvalues were
10.080, 1.475, and 1.213, respectively, with remaining
eigenvalues less than 1.0. One method for determining the
number of factors, the scree method, looks for a large drop
in the eigenvalues and then a trailing off of subsequent val-
ues (Rummel, 1970). If the first eigenvalue is large relative
to the second, this suggests that the items are approximately
unidimensional (Lord, 1980). A second rule for determining
the number of factors is the number of eigenvalues greater
than 1. The first method suggests a one-factor solution,
whereas the second suggests a three-factor solution.

factor model after oblique (Promax) rotation. The ADL
items had strong (>.5) loadings on one factor; three items
("managing money," "taking medications," and "using the
phone") that typically reflect cognitive confusion or poor
memory loaded strongly on the second factor. The IADL
items, however, tended to have moderate loadings on both
the second and third factors. Removing one item ("go
places outside of walking distance") resulted in a clearer
factor structure: ADL items, IADL items, and "cognitive
IADL" items each loaded strongly on one factor and rela-
tively less strongly on the others. These results, combined
with the fact that "go places outside of walking distance"
could reflect the availability of transportation rather than
disability, led us to discard this item from further analyses.
Eigenvalues were recalculated, based on the reduced set of
15 items. The large first eigenvalue pattern was maintained.
The first three eigenvalues were 9.915, 1.326, and 1.020.
Although the three-factor model was clear and inter-
pretable, the factors themselves had moderately strong cor-
relations, which ranged between .608 and .652. In a two-
factor model, the ADL items loaded strongly (>.76O) on the
first factor and IADL items loaded strongly (>.714) on the
second. However, three items had high loadings on both
factors: taking medicine (.396, .477), getting around out-
side (.355, .383) and help with incontinence (.596, .361).
The two factors correlated .696. The two-factor structure
thus was less clear than the three-factor structure. When
only one factor was extracted, all items had substantial
loadings, with the lowest loading being .710.
Using the second half of the sample, a confirmatory factor
analysis specified three factors, corresponding to the three-
factor exploratory results. Table 3 presents the estimates for
this model. The factor loading for each item was strong and
significant. The goodness-of-fit chi-square statistic for the

model was 311.37 (df = 87). Compared to a null model of
complete independence (x2 = 25553.49, df= 105), the fit of
this model was excellent, with Bentler's (1990) fit index =
.99. (Values above .90 are conventionally considered to indi-
cate a good fitting model.) The value of the root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA), which estimates
the discrepancy between the population covariance matrix
and the covariance matrix implied by the best fitting model,
was .042; Browne and Cudeck (1993) suggested that values
less than .05 indicate an acceptable model.
Estimated correlations between the three factors were .91
(Factors 1 and 2), .85 (Factors 1. and 3) and .86 (Factors 2
and 3). Factor correlations of this large magnitude suggest
that a one-factor model describes the data parsimoniously.
The model was re-estimated, constraining the factors to be
perfectly correlated. This model resulted in a chi-square of
430.28 (df = 90). Although this was a statistically signifi-
cant difference from the three-factor model, Bentler's fit
index was still 0.98, compared to a null model of complete
independence. The RMSEA for this model was .050. In ad-
dition, the eigenvalues were 10.079, 1.213, and 1.099 in
this half of the sample.
A two-factor model was also estimated by constraining the
second (IADL) and third (cognitive) factors to be perfectly
correlated and to have equal correlations with the first factor.
This model resulted in a chi-square of 377.92 (df= 89). The
estimated correlation between the two factors was .927,
again suggesting that a one-factor model is appropriate.
These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a
single dimension underlies responses to these items. Ham-
bleton, Swaminathan, and Rogers (1991) noted that the uni-
dimensionality assumption of IRT is met adequately if a
dominant component or factor underlies responses to the
items. The results thus justify estimating unidimensional
item-response models for these data. Consequently, IRT
analyses proceeded, based on a one-factor model.
IRT Analyses
Table 4 presents results of IRT analyses of 15 items for
the entire sample of 2,977 respondents. Both one- and two-
parameter models were estimated. Table 4 shows location
estimates from the one-parameter model (Column 1), and
estimates of item locations (Column 2) and slopes (Column
3) from the two-parameter model.
The chi-square (-2 times the log likelihood) for the one-
parameter model was 39221.33, whereas the chi-square for
the two-parameter model was 38524.16. A likelihood-ratio
test comparing the two models indicated that the two-
parameter model was significantly different from the one-
parameter model (x2 = 697, df= 14). However, a large sam-
ple size increases the magnitude of this statistic, making
statistical significance easy to attain. The difference in chi-
square of 697 amounted to only a 2% reduction in the chi-
square of the one-parameter model.
Estimates of the slopes from the two-parameter model
ranged from .685 for "finances" to 1.694 for "toileting."
However, many of the slope estimates were concentrated
between 1.2 and 1.5. In addition, the order of the items in
terms of the location parameters was similar for both mod-
els. The only major difference in the ordering of item lo-

cations occurred for "taking medicines" and "managing
money," which ranked 9 and 11, respectively, in the two-
parameter model but ranked 6 and 7, respectively, in the
one-parameter model. Other items maintained the same rel-
ative order in both models.
Several factors suggest that the one-parameter model
provides an acceptable fit. First, the fit of the two-parameter
model was not markedly better than the one-parameter
model, insofar as a 2% reduction in chi-square was substan-
tively trivial. Second, many of the items had slope parame-
ters of similar magnitude. Third, the correlation between
the estimated 6s in the one- and the two-parameter models
was .994. We therefore decided that the improvement in fit
of the two-parameter model did not outweigh its added com-
plexity. Subsequent analyses focused on the one-parameter
model. The reliability of the one-parameter scale was .88,
based on estimates of true-score and error variance derived
from IRT (Zimowski et al., 1996).
Item location parameters. -- The item location parame-
ters for the one-parameter model ranged from a low of
-.826 ("shopping") to a high of 1.614 ("feeding"). Because
this is a one-parameter IRT model, the ordering of item lo-
cation parameters was consistent with the proportion re-
sponding positively to each item (Table 1). Although there
was a general clustering of IADL items at the low end and
ADLs at the high end of the scale, IADL and ADL items
did overlap in terms of their location parameters. For exam-
ple, "bathing" had the third lowest location after "shop-
ping" and "laundry." At the high end of the scale, five out of
the highest six items were ADLs, but "telephoning" was lo-
cated with ADLs. "Getting around inside" preceded "light
housework," based on the point estimates, although confi-
dence intervals for their locations did overlap.
One of the features of IRT is that the distribution of item
location parameters determines the breadth of disability the
scale measures and how well it differentiates disability lev-
els in a particular range. Large gaps in item location param-
eters identify points at which 0 is measured with relatively
less precision, and suggest that the precision of the scale
could be improved by adding additional items with location
parameters that fill the gaps. Examining the location param-
eters for the one-parameter model reveals several clusters
of items with gaps between the clusters (Table 4).
Because "shopping" had by far the lowest location pa-
rameter, including this item in the scale helps to identify
differences in disability at the low end of the range. "Laun-
dry" and "bathing" were at the next level, but there was a
large gap between them and "shopping" with respect to the
magnitude of the location parameters (i.e., -.826 vs -.188
and -.103). "Getting around outside" and "preparing
meals" were next in terms of their location along the dis-
ability dimension. The next group of six items had similar
location parameters in the middle of the continuum, rang-
ing from .380 to .699. There was a gap between these items
and "toileting" and "telephoning." A further gap occurred
between these items and the last two items ("feeding" and
"incontinence"). Overall, the 15-item scale has maximum
precision at .5, near the "light housework" item. This re-
flects the relatively large number of items with location pa-
rameters between .3 and .6.
Estimates of disability. -- Table 5 presents the distribu-
tion of the IRT estimates of disability (6j). As noted, these
estimates were derived using a Bayesian approach, as the
mean of the posterior distribution of 6. A feature of the one-
parameter IRT model is that all persons with the same num-
ber of positive responses have the same estimated 6. The
distribution of disability estimates thus has 16 discrete val-
ues. (Because we dropped one item from the analysis, it
was possible for some respondents to answer all the re-
maining items negatively, resulting in a raw score of zero.)
Because the origin and unit for the scale of 6 is arbitrary,
the estimates of 07
were normalized to a mean of zero and a
variance of 1. To aid in interpretation of the 0 estimates,
and to have a metric similar to a count, the expected num-
ber of items on which a respondent was disabled was cal-
culated for each value of 0. This was accomplished by in-
serting the item parameter estimates and the estimate of 0
into the formula for the item characteristic curve for each
item, using this formula to calculate the probability of an-
swering each item in the affirmative, and summing these
probabilities across all 15 items (Hambleton, Swaminathan,
& Rogers, 1991).
In general, the intervals between expected scores were
roughly equal. Only one interval, between raw scores of 8
and 9, was as much as two times the average. Relatively
smaller than average intervals appeared between 0 and 1, 1
and 2, and 5 and 6. The number of items with positive re-
sponses (the "raw count" score) correlated .99 with the 0
estimate from the one-parameter model and with the ex-
pected score. This result, together with the relatively equal
spacing between the expected scores, suggest that a simple
count of the IADLs and ADLs may be a reasonable approx-
imation to the 0 estimate from the one-parameter model
when measuring disability.

Relationships with Other Variables
We examined the relationship of the 15-item scale with
several relevant variables, including a measure of the total
number of hours of IADL and ADL help received in the last
week. In the 1989 NLTCS, for each ADL and IADL, the re-
spondent named both formal and informal caregivers. For
each caregiver (up to six), respondents indicated how many
hours of ADL help and how many hours of IADL help were
provided in the last week. The correlation between the
IADL/ADL scale and total hours of IADL/ADL help was
.7. In a regression analysis of total hours of help on 3 sepa-
rate scales, corresponding to the three factors postulated in
Table 3, the R2 was 0.493, compared to an R2 of 0.487 for
the IADL/ADL scale alone, indicating little gain in ex-
planatory power from separating functional disability into
three variables, rather than one. Table 5 shows that the
mean hours of help ranged from 7 hours a week for persons
with no disabilities to 99 hours for persons with 15 disabili-
ties. This demonstrates the broad range of disability needs
that this scale covers, from needs averaging as little as 1
hour a day to essentially around-the-clock help.
Table 6 presents mean estimates of 0 for groups based on
gender, race (White/non-White) and age (less than 80 vs 80
or older). As expected, older disabled respondents had
higher mean disability than younger ones. In addition, aver-
age disability was higher among disabled non-Whites than
among disabled Whites. It is surprising that mean disability
was higher among men than among women (5.6 for men vs
5.0 for women based on the raw count; t = 3.3). Previous
research has shown that women are more likely than men to
be functionally disabled (Dawson, Hendershot, & Fulton,
1987; Foley et al., 1986), mainly because women are more
likely than men to have nonfatal chronic conditions (Ver-
brugge, 1987). The present results show that, despite over-
all lower prevalence rates, among the disabled, men have
more severe disability than women.
When interpreting this finding, one concern is that, con-
trolling for their underlying level of disability, men would
be more likely to respond positively to IADL items because

they may not normally do these activities. In other words,
gender bias in types of activities routinely performed might
explain this result. To deal with this concern, some re-
searchers reduce the number of IADL items used for men
(Lawton & Brody, 1969). Another approach, which was
used in the NLTCS, is to ask if inability to do an IADL is
due to health problems. This approach should reduce the
gender bias problem, but may not be sufficient to remove
it totally.
A major advantage of IRT is its capability of systemati-
cally assessing differential item functioning (DIF). If an
item has substantially different parameters in different sub-
groups, this suggests that the item may be "biased," reflect-
ing a variable in addition to the one being measured
(Thissen, Steinberg, & Wainer, 1992). We tested for gender
DIF by performing a multiple-group IRT analysis and exam-
ining the largest differences in location parameters for men
and women. For women, location parameters were lower for
three items ("shopping," "going outside," and "bathing"),
and were higher for three other items ("taking medications,"
"telephoning," and "light housework"). Removing the latter
three items from the scale did not alter the conclusion that
men were more disabled (expected counts were 4.97 for
men and 4.64 or women, t = 3.24). (The exclusion of the
former set of items would make men even more disabled
relative to women.) Although an extensive DIF analysis is
beyond the scope of this article, these results illustrate the
potential for IRT to illuminate issues of DIF.
DISCUSSION
This article has addressed the question of whether IADL
and ADL items can be combined into a single scale to mea-
sure functional disability. Results suggest two major con-
clusions. First, factor analyses indicated that 15 ADL and
IADL items can be represented as a one-dimensional con-
struct. This justifies combining these items into a single
overall scale. Major advantages of the 15-item IADL/ADL
scale are its larger range, compared to scales based solely
on IADLs or on ADLs, as well as its parsimony, compared
to using separate ADL and IADL scales. Second, IRT anal-
yses explicitly compared the one- and two-parameter IRT
models and found that the one-parameter model adequately
represented the data. The implication of this finding is that
the total number of items with a "disabled" response is
sufficient to represent a person's level of functional disabil-
S54 SPECTOR AND FLEISHMAN
ity. In addition, the analysis identified gaps in the scale
where discrimination could be improved by additional well-
chosen items.
Dimensionality
Prior analyses that obtained a multidimensional structure
generally used more heterogeneous sets of items, which in-
cluded measures of bowel or bladder continence and physi-
cal limitations in addition to ADLs and IADLs. Item het-
erogeneity may have contributed to the emergence of
multiple dimensions. One exception is Fitzgerald et al.
(1993), who used a standard set of IADL and ADL items;
they found four correlated factors including an incontinence
factor. Their study sample, hospitalized persons aged 45
and over, was very different from the other studies. In addi-
tion, like many studies, they used principal components
analysis with dichotomous variables, which may result in
additional artifactual factors.
Using 14,415 respondents from the NLTCS, Clark,
Stump, and Wolinsky (1997) fit a three-factor model using
10 of the 15 items considered in this article (excluding
dressing, meal preparation, getting around outside, help
with incontinence, and eating). They used items from the
screener, which did not provide as much detail as corre-
sponding items from the community interview. They found
that a three-factor model fit adequately for the whole sam-
ple, as well as for subgroups of White men, White women,
and Black women. However, Clark et al. did not report in-
terfactor correlations, nor did they directly compare one-
and three-factor models.
The use of Pearson correlations in factor analyses of di-
chotomous items, as in some prior studies, may result in a
bias toward multiple-factor solutions. For dichotomous (or
polytomous) items, the maximum value of Pearson correla-
tion coefficients may be constrained to be less than 1.0 due
to differential skewness of the items. This may lead, in turn,
to relatively low estimates of interitem or interfactor corre-
lations. Using data from the first half of the sample, a stan-
dard principal components analysis, which used Pearson
correlations among the 15 items and specified 3 factors,
yielded interfactor correlations ranging from .40 to .52.
These interfactor correlations were lower in magnitude than
those obtained using tetrachoric correlations, and they
make a weaker case for selecting a unidimensional repre-
sentation for these items. The choice of a correlation coeffi-
cient may thus have led other investigators to prefer multi-
factor models.
The use of tetrachoric correlations when analyzing di-
chotomous items is considered the methodological "gold
standard" (Stump, Clark, Johnson, & Wolinsky, 1997). How-
ever, tetrachoric correlations rely on the assumption that
that underlying latent variables are normally distributed.
Checks of this assumption in the current data, using the
method proposed by Muthen and Hofacker (1988), sug-
gested that this assumption was violated in a number of in-
stances. The effects of violating this assumption on esti-
mates of factor loadings and interfactor correlations are
largely unknown, however (Muthen, 1993). More method-
ological work needs to be conducted to develop procedures
for dealing with any such violations in applied research.
Although the present results warrant treating these items
as unidimensional, for some purposes, distinguishing three
factors might have heuristic value. It is possible that the
three factors might have different sets of antecedents or
consequences. However, when examining the consequences
of functional disability, using a single scale offers analytic
advantages; in particular, including multiple subscales, with
substantial intercorrelations, into a single regression model
can give rise to problems of collinearity and related diffi-
culty in interpreting regression coefficients. In addition, the
present results do suggest that, in contrast to one- or three-
factor models, a two-factor model (ADLs and IADLs) was
not the best representation of these data. Neither the scree
test nor the number of eigenvalues greater than 1 pointed to
a two-factor model; in addition, solutions with two factors
lacked the simple factor structure of a three-factor model
and also revealed very high interfactor correlations. The
common practice of deriving one scale of ADLs and a sepa-
rate scale of IADLs may not be justified.
IRT Analyses
The IRT analyses demonstrated that a one-parameter
model fit the data adequately. Although a likelihood-ratio
test showed that the two-parameter model fit significantly
better than a one-parameter model, a large sample size can
produce significant differences that are substantively trivial.
Moreover, the extremely high correlation between the indi-
vidual disability estimates from the one- and two-parameter
models implies that the two-parameter model does not add
a great deal of information beyond the one-parameter
model. The one-parameter model also has the advantage of
assuring that items can be ordered unambiguously, in the
sense that their ICC curves do not cross. In sum, the one-
parameter model provides a simple and parsimonious rep-
resentation for these data, whereas the slightly improved fit
of the two-parameter model is outweighed by its added
complexity. If a two-parameter model had been preferred,
the implication would have been that an optimal disability
score would have to consider the pattern of responses to each
item, not simply the total number of "disabled" responses.
IRT provides other valuable information for assessing
and developing measurement scales. First, the IRT esti-
mates of 0 can be treated as comprising an interval scale
(Wright & Stone, 1979); in contrast, the number of disabled
items does not possess interval-scale properties. Whereas
the product-moment correlation between the IRT estimate
of 0 and the number of "disabled" responses will often be
high (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994, p. 434), for some analy-
ses, such as when estimating change in 0 over time, having
an interval scale would be useful. Second, unlike classical
test theory, IRT highlights the fact that a scale's reliability
fluctuates across the latent dimension, depending in part on
the combination of item location parameters. Examination
of the scale's measurement precision at each point along
the latent dimension aids in further item and scale develop-
ment. Third, comparisons of item parameters across differ-
ent subgroups provide a means of testing for differential
item functioning, which may affect group comparisons.
IRT provides explicit procedures for selecting items to
measure particular ranges of 0 with precision. For example,
FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY S55
interest may center on measuring relatively severe levels of
disability. ADLs are often used for this purpose. IRT item
location parameters could be used to select a subset of
items focused on this range. IRT analyses in this article
suggest that most, but not all, ADL items do reflect high
levels of disability, but "bathing" had a location parameter
lower than some IADL items, while "telephoning" had a lo-
cation parameter higher than many ADLs. Thus, for mea-
suring severe disability, improvements may be possible by
adding IADL items, such as "telephoning," to the standard
set of ADL items. Moreover, if the number of items to mea-
sure severe functional disability is limited, one might con-
sider removing "bathing" from a set of ADL items. On the
other hand, to measure less severe disability, "bathing"
might be combined with IADL items.
The IRT analyses excluded a large number of people
without any measured disability. For the purposes of cali-
brating the scale, persons with a score of zero provide mini-
mal information concerning the performance of the items.
Analogously, if one administered a mathematics test con-
sisting of simple addition problems to college students, one
could conclude only that the test was too easy for the large
number of persons with perfect scores. For this group, one
would not have a precise measure of their mathematics
ability, nor could one differentiate among them in terms
of mathematics ability. Nevertheless, a score of zero on the
ADL/IADL scale does provide some important informa-
tion. It is likely that an expanded disability scale, one which
was more sensitive to milder forms of disability, would pro-
vide further discrimination among this group. Future efforts
in scale development could address this issue.
Advantages of IRT over Gunman Scaling
Historically, ADLs and IADLs have frequently been ana-
lyzed using Guttman scaling. If items follow a pure
Guttman pattern, they have a hierarchical relationship; that
is, they have a specific order in terms of increasing diffi-
culty (i.e., higher location parameters). Katz et al. (1963)
argued that the ADL items were approximately hierarchi-
cally related, with an order (in terms of difficulty): bathing,
dressing, toileting, transferring, incontinence, and feeding.
These items have very high Guttman coefficients of repro-
ducibility and scalability for home care and nursing home
populations (Kane & Kane, 1981; Spector, 1996; Spector &
Takada, 1991).
One problem with Guttman methodology is that it as-
sumes a deterministic, not a stochastic, model. In other
words, the ICC in the Guttman model specifies that, below a
certain difficulty level, a person has a zero probability of a
positive response to the item, and, above that level, a posi-
tive response is certain. The absence of a random error com-
ponent is unrealistic. Another problem is that the Guttman
model presumes a specific ordering of items. However, sev-
eral different orderings of items can produce satisfactory
Guttman scale coefficients of reproducibility and scalability
(Lazaridis et al., 1994). Finally, it is often unclear how to
score respondents who have imperfect scale patterns. For
example, Katz developed his ADL scale by observing the
patterns of items, combining a number of different patterns
into a single level of disability, and developing an "other"
category for patterns that were not pure scale types. Often
researchers use high Guttman scale coefficients to justify or-
dering people by counting the number of tasks with limita-
tions, despite the fact that a number of response patterns do
not conform to the pure Guttman pattern.
The hierarchical relationship between IADLs and ADLs
has received less attention than relationships among ADLs
or among IADLs, and Guttman scaling has been used to ad-
dress this issue. Lawton and Brody (1969) suggested that
IADLs were more complex than ADLs, implying that these
items would consistently have a lower location on a disabil-
ity scale. Spector et al. (1987), using Guttman scaling,
found that two IADLs, "shopping" and "transportation,"
represented a lower level of disability relative to ADLs. The
present study, which used a much larger number of IADLs
than Spector et al. (1987), demonstrates that IADLs and
ADLs overlap in terms of item location parameters. For ex-
ample, "getting around outside" and "preparing meals"
were located between "bathing" and "dressing." Suurmeijer
et al. (1994) and Kempen, Myers, and Powell (1995) found
similar overlap with IADL and ADL items. Thus, IADL
and ADL items do not necessarily have a strict hierarchical
relationship.
Implicationsfor Eligibility Determination
States are using functional disability measures to deter-
mine who is eligible for long-term care and to determine
triggering criteria for the insured event in long-term care
policies. Although approaches vary, essentially all states
use activities of daily living, but many do not include in-
strumental activities of daily living criteria (U.S. General
Accounting Office, 1994). Using a scale that includes both
ADLs and IADLs may enable more precise assessment of
the level of functional disability of applicants than using
ADLs alone. This would also affect who would be eligible
for these programs.
We compared an eligibility criterion based on the
IADL/ADL scale to an ADL-only criterion, with the con-
straint that roughly the same number of persons would be
eligible under both criteria. Although the equal number cri-
terion cannot be precisely met, a close comparison is be-
tween a cutpoint of 4 or more ADL deficits using an ADL
only scale and 9 or more deficits on the ADL/IADL scale.
With this comparison, the eligible populations are 735 and
713, respectively. By considering both ADLs and IADLs
when scoring disability, the IADL/ADL scale cutpoint of 9
or more deficits would include 86 persons with less than 4
ADLs who have at least 6 IADL deficits. It excludes 108
persons with four or more ADLs who have few IADL
deficits. Thus, in about 15% of these cases, the ADL only
criterion and the IADL/ADL criterion lead to discrepant
conclusions. (Of course, this discrepancy would depend on
the specific ADL cutpoint.) The extent of this misallocation
can be viewed by looking at the mean hours of ADL and
IADL help received. Those eligible using the ADL only cri-
terion, but not eligible with the ADL/IADL criterion, aver-
aged 45 hours of care; those eligible with the ADL/IADL
criterion, but not eligible with the ADL only criterion, aver-
aged 51 hours of care. Those eligible under both criteria
averaged 78 hours of care; those not eligible averaged 18

hours. As expected, the ADL/IADL scale, rather than the
ADL scale only, more effectively targets persons who
would receive more hours of ADL and IADL care.
Future Research
We have demonstrated the feasibility and validity of
combining ADLs and IADLs into one scale for a represen-
tative sample of functionally disabled elderly persons living
in the community. It is important to remember that the scal-
ing properties are dependent on the exact items and defini-
tions of disability used. An important research question is
the degree to which different definitions of disability affect
scale properties. In this study the ADL items measured the
receipt of human help, including receipt of standby help.
Other studies have included use of mechanical help in
defining ADL disability; still others present definitions that
exclude both standby and mechanical help (Leon & Lair,
1990; Manton, Stallard, & Corder, 1995; Stone & Mur-
taugh, 1990).
Other surveys and researchers define disability in terms
of respondent reports of difficulty in performing tasks, and
they may or may not separate out those who receive human
help. Using a definition in terms of difficulty may introduce
variation due to respondents' different conceptions of what
is "difficult"; on the other hand, such a definition has the
advantage of extending the range of measurement of dis-
ability by including persons who have difficulty but do not
need human help. In contrast, a definition reflecting re-
ceived help restricts the range of disability measured, and it
confounds aspects of the person's support network with dis-
ability. Ideally, a measure of disability based on human
help should be defined in terms of need rather than in terms
of receipt, so that it avoids a confound with availability of
caregivers. However, no consensus exists on the proper way
to measure need. Sensitivity analyses are necessary to as-
sess how changes in wording, definitions of disability, and
response scales alter IRT item parameters.
IRT analyses can identify points along the range of 9 in
which additional items would improve the precision of the
scale. "Gaps" between item location parameters indicate
such points. Future efforts need to improve the scale by de-
veloping items to address the gaps identified in the analy-
ses, including at the low end of the scale (between "shop-
ping" and "laundry"), at the moderately high end (between
"toileting" and "telephoning"), and at the high end of the
scale (between "toileting" and "telephoning'V'feeding'7
"help with incontinence"). Future research should also ex-
tend the range of the scale by developing items to measure
less severe functional disability.
Future research should examine whether item locations
are independent of demographic and impairment character-
istics. For example, comprehensive analyses of possible dif-
ferential item functioning by gender, which cross-validate
the DIF analyses in the present article, would be valuable.
Future DIF analyses should also examine if item parame-
ters are sufficiently constant across the age spectrum to jus-
tify using the scale to compare elderly persons with
younger persons. Further, the present research needs to be
replicated for other populations, such as the under-65 dis-
abled, to assess whether the scale provides a common mea-
sure of disability across all impairment groups. A study of
the Functional Independence Measure, a measure com-
monly used in medical rehabilitation, indicated that there is
little item bias for motor items except for burns and back
pain groups (Heinemann, 1993). The extent that these re-
sults apply to ADL/IADL scales must be determined.
