The outcomes of social interactions among members of
different groups--termed intergroup or cross-group inter-
actions--have long been of interest to psychologists.
Within this literature, the term group represents a social
category (e.g., race, religious affiliation, sexual orienta-
tion), with ingroup denoting a social category that can be
used to categorize one's self and outgroup denoting other
social categories. Two related literatures on the topic of
intergroup interactions have emerged: the intergroup
interaction literature and the intergroup contact literature.
Although intergroup interaction and intergroup contact
essentially have the same definition (i.e., social interaction
among members of different groups),1 the two literatures
yield contradictory conclusions when it comes to whether
intergroup interactions positively or negatively impact
intergroup relations. In the present article, we use the term
intergroup bias as an overarching construct that represents
relatively negative beliefs (e.g., stereotypes), feelings/eval-
uations (e.g., prejudice), and behaviors (e.g., discrimina-
tion) toward an outgroup. Although multifaceted, the term
intergroup bias is used to represent general negativity
toward outgroups. Intergroup interaction is typically found
to exacerbate intergroup bias, producing heightened
stress, anxiety, or outgroup avoidance (Shelton, Dovidio,
Hebl, & Richeson, 2009; Trawalter, Richeson, & Shelton,
2009). Intergroup contact, however, is typically found to
reduce intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxi-
ety and lower prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The
paradoxical nature of these findings is rarely recognized
and has yet to be systematically examined. We propose
that methodological differences may account for this
divide and that these two literatures can be integrated by
considering an overall model of negotiating intergroup
experience over time. We expect that adopting this model
will streamline thinking in the field and will generate

How Can Intergroup Interaction Be Bad If
Intergroup Contact Is Good? Exploring and
Reconciling an Apparent Paradox in the
Science of Intergroup Relations

Abstract
The outcomes of social interactions among members of different groups (e.g., racial groups, political groups, sexual
orientation groups) have long been of interest to psychologists. Two related literatures on the topic have emerged--
the intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literature--in which divergent conclusions have
been reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing
heightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have
positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these
paradoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels
of the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures.
Further, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled. We believe
that adopting this model will streamline thinking in the field and will generate integrative new research in which
investigators examine how a person's experiences with diversity unfold.

Intergroup Interaction Versus
Intergroup Contact
For the current purposes, we use the term intergroup
interaction to describe social interactions among group
members in which the social interaction itself is directly
observed (Avery, Richeson, Hebl, & Ambady, 2009;
Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, Lickel, & Kowai-Bell, 2001;
Hyers & Swim, 1998; Littleford, Wright, & Sayoc-Parial,
2005; Shelton, 2003; Shelton, Richeson, & Salvatore, 2005;
Shelton, West, & Trail, 2010; Vorauer & Kumhyr, 2001).
We use the term intergroup contact to describe individual
differences in the quality and quantity of intergroup
interactions, most typically operationalized as the amal-
gamation of past intergroup interactions (Barnard &
Benn, 1987; Bettencourt, Brewer, Croak, & Miller, 1992;
Clunies Ross & O'Meara, 1989; Dhont & Van Hiel, 2009;
Hodson, Harry, & Mitchell, 2009; Islam & Hewstone,
1993; Johnson & Johnson, 1985; Page-Gould, 2012;
Pettigrew, 1997; Shook & Fazio, 2008; Turner, Hewstone,
& Voci, 2007; K. West & Hewstone, 2012; Wilder, 1984).
This nomenclature is common in the intergroup literature
and reflects the most frequent uses of the terms.
Accordingly, we use this operationalization. However,
these two constructs have not been rigorously disambig-
uated in either the contact or interaction literatures,
including some notable examples of a complete merging
of the two constructs (Wilder & Thompson, 1980). We
see these constructs as naturally conflated, but they
nonetheless have disambiguating features.
In intergroup interaction studies, researchers typically
examine short interactions between ingroup and outgroup
members. By design, these studies are typically stranger
interactions (i.e., neither participant knows each other)
that take place in a laboratory setting. These interactions
are often structured or guided by researchers, in which
interaction partners complete tasks such as playing a party
game (Blascovich et al., 2001) or answering questions pro-
vided by researchers (Avery et al., 2009; Hyers & Swim,
1998; Littleford et al., 2005; Page-Gould, Mendoza-Denton,
& Tropp, 2008; Shelton, 2003; Vorauer & Kumhyr, 2001). In
some cases, however, these interactions are unstructured
(Ickes, 1984), which has the potential to amplify anxiety
(Avery et al., 2009; Stephan, 2014). Both during and after
the interaction, the quality of the interaction and its down-
stream consequences are measured subjectively (e.g., self-
reported affect; Shelton, 2003; Stephan & Stephan, 1985),
behaviorally (Plant & Devine, 2003; Richeson & Shelton,
2003), or physiologically (Blascovich et al., 2001; Littleford
et al., 2005; Mendes, Blascovich, Lickel, & Hunter, 2002;
Page-Gould et al., 2008). In the majority of these studies,
researchers have examined interactions among people
belonging to different ethnic or racial groups (i.e., interra-
cial interactions; Avery et al., 2009; Littleford et al., 2005;
Mallett, Wilson, & Gilbert, 2008; Plant & Devine, 2003;
Richeson & Shelton, 2003; Shelton, 2003; Vorauer &
Kumhyr, 2001; but for an exception, see Blascovich et al.,
2001, Experiments 1 and 2).
Generally, these studies demonstrate that intergroup
interactions produce negative outcomes for individuals,
such as anxiety and discomfort. People report that they
feel anxious during intergroup interactions (i.e., inter-
group anxiety; Stephan & Stephan, 1985, 1989). Even
anticipating intergroup interactions can induce concerns
about being viewed negatively by one's partner (Vorauer,
Hunter, Main, & Roy, 2000) and avoidance of the interac-
tion, which is detrimental for the individual as well as
society at large (Mallett et al., 2008; Plant & Devine,
2003). Actually engaging in these interactions can pro-
duce anxiety (Hyers & Swim, 1998; Littleford et al., 2005;
Shelton, 2003), a threatened social identity (Shelton,
Richeson, & Vorauer, 2006), and patterns of physiological
responses consistent with threat (Blascovich et al., 2001;
Mendes et al., 2002; Page-Gould et al., 2008). The conclu-
sion from the intergroup interaction literature is that
intergroup interactions are stressful and anxiety-provok-
ing and that these reactions predict increased intergroup
bias (Paolini, Hewstone, Voci, Harwood, & Cairns, 2006).
The findings from intergroup contact studies, how-
ever, typically reflect long-term contact with outgroup
members (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Most often, partici-
pants provide self-reports of the quantity and quality of
interactions they have had with outgroup members.
Some measures of intergroup contact specify the content
of the intergroup interactions (e.g., "How often have you
had informal conversations with . . ."; Islam & Hewstone,
1993), but many intergroup contact measures are
designed to assess the quantity of intergroup contact
without regard to the content or goal of the intergroup
interactions that comprised the contact (Harwood,
Hewstone, Paolini, & Voci, 2005). Typically, researchers
of these studies aim to estimate the association between
this contact and some form of intergroup bias (e.g., prej-
udice, intergroup anxiety, discriminatory behavior).
When intergroup contact is actually observed rather than
assessed through self-reports, the contact is typically
structured or guided by researchers (Barnard & Benn,
1987; Bettencourt et al., 1992; Clunies Ross & O'Meara,
1989; Johnson & Johnson, 1985; Wilder, 1984); however,
in some cases, observed contact is allowed to be unstruc-
tured (Shook & Fazio, 2008). Several types of intergroup
contact have been examined, including contact among
people with dissimilarities in race (Dhont & Van Hiel,
2009; Page-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Pettigrew,
1997; Tropp, 2007), sexual orientation (Herek & Capitanio,
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 309
1996; Hodson, Harry, & Mitchell, 2009; K. West &
Hewstone, 2012), or religion (Islam & Hewstone, 1993;
Tam et al., 2007).
Intergroup contact studies portray a positive picture of
how intergroup interactions relate to intergroup bias.
Across hundreds of studies, there is a consistent, small
negative relationship between intergroup contact and
prejudice (Pearson's r = -.21; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006),
suggesting that contact is beneficial for individuals, inter-
personal relations, and society overall. Contrasting the
heightened anxiety observed in intergroup interactions,
contact studies typically demonstrate that intergroup con-
tact is associated with less intergroup anxiety (Islam &
Hewstone, 1993; Paolini, Hewstone, Cairns, & Voci, 2004;
Voci & Hewstone, 2003) and more positive attitudes
toward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Moreover,
lower intergroup anxiety explains some of the relation-
ship between contact and lower prejudice (Binder et al.,
2009; Paolini et al., 2004; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008; Voci
& Hewstone, 2003), and lower prejudice also leads to
increased contact (Binder et al., 2009). Overall, therefore,
the negative relationship between intergroup contact and
intergroup bias is explained in part through the promo-
tion of positive intergroup interactions.
At first glance, it appears as if studies on intergroup
interaction and intergroup contact contradict each other,
but this is simply a matter of scale. An intergroup interac-
tion is the atomic unit of intergroup contact. People who
have any degree of intergroup contact (e.g., ranging from
none at all to daily) can engage in an intergroup interac-
tion, but not all people who find themselves in intergroup
interactions would be said to have much intergroup con-
tact. It is possible that people at the low end of intergroup
contact are pulling down the average quality of intergroup
interactions. In other words, when a person has his or her
first few intergroup interactions, his or her experiences
may be quite variable. After a certain critical number of
good intergroup interactions have occurred, then subse-
quent intergroup interactions are likely to be positive
(Blascovich et al., 2001; Page-Gould et al., 2008), and more
positive intergroup interactions improve intergroup atti-
tudes (Paolini et al., 2006). That is, we predict that after
someone has reached a certain degree of intergroup con-
tact, then the small linear relationship observed across the
intergroup contact literature (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) will
describe the relationship between intergroup interactions
and intergroup bias. We label this the contact threshold
(which we elaborate on later). In other words, there may
be short-term "costs" to intergroup interactions (e.g.,
heightened anxiety) but long-term intergroup gains (e.g.,
lower prejudice). People may reach a point or threshold
whereby intergroup interactions are no longer costly to
individuals or society at large but are, instead, beneficial
for intergroup relations.
Accounting for the Divide
Although the terms intergroup interaction and intergroup
contact have been used interchangeably--and not erro-
neously so--their differing conclusions suggest that they
are capturing two distinct processes. We propose that this
is because different levels of the same phenomenon are
being examined in the two literatures. Concomitant with
this difference in scale, studies on intergroup interaction
and intergroup contact systematically differ in their meth-
odological approaches. As a result, one or more interre-
lated methodological differences between the two
literatures, as we discuss later, may account for their
divergent conclusions (see Table 1 for a summary of
these differences).
Context
The dominant study designs in the intergroup interaction
and intergroup contact literatures--experimental and
cross-sectional, respectively--may partially account for
the divide between the two literatures. Next, we discuss
two potential reasons for this.
Artificial versus real-life setting. Intergroup interac-
tions in the laboratory are inherently artificial because
the experimenter stages them. When people are report-
ing their intergroup contact, however, they are most
likely reflecting on real intergroup interactions that
occurred and progressed naturally. Although the experi-
mental control afforded in laboratory-based intergroup
interaction studies provides superior evidence for causal
inference, it also limits ecological validity (see Blascovich
et al., 2002, for discussion of more ecologically valid,
laboratory-based approaches). Intergroup interactions in
artificial settings may produce more negative outcomes
(e.g., stress, anxiety) than those occurring in more natu-
ral settings because laboratory participants (a) may have
few past contact experiences, (b) have no control over
the laboratory situation (Amat et al., 2005; S. Cohen,
1980), (c) may experience evaluation apprehension
(Weber & Cook, 1972), and (d) may typically avoid inter-
group interactions in everyday life (Mallett et al., 2008).
In other words, those self-reporting more intergroup con-
tact are likely to be lower in intergroup anxiety and less
likely to avoid intergroup contact, whereas participants in
laboratory studies may have little past contact and may
even actively avoid intergroup interactions until they find
themselves in the anxiety-provoking laboratory setting,
inflating the negative effects observed.
Indeed, laboratory-based intergroup interactions pro-
duce threat reactions primarily among those with little
intergroup contact, with those reporting more intergroup
contact experiencing less threat (Blascovich et al., 2001).
310 MacInnis, Page-Gould
Some evidence also suggests that intergroup contact not
only reduces intergroup anxiety but that intergroup anxi-
ety reduces intergroup contact (Swart, Hewstone, Christ,
& Voci, 2011), suggesting a selection bias consistent with
the observed bidirectional association between inter-
group contact and intergroup bias (Binder et al., 2009;
Swart et al., 2011; but for an exception, see van Laar,
Levin, Sinclair, & Sidanius, 2005). Further, given the
apparent anxiety plaguing intergroup interactions
(Shelton et al., 2009), increased anxiety and conflict
would be expected in real-life intergroup versus ingroup
interactions. This main effect of intergroup context on
anxiety and conflict, however, is only sometimes observed
in longitudinal studies of intergroup interactions (cf.
Cook, Calcagno, Arrow, & Malle, 2012, and Shelton et al.,
2005, with Page-Gould, 2012, and Shelton et al., 2010). If
people who are prone to anxiety in intergroup interac-
tions avoid these interactions, then most intergroup inter-
actions that occur outside the laboratory may be among
people who are least apprehensive about intergroup
interactions. It is possible that, in the real world, inter-
group interactions may not be any more stressful than
ingroup interactions because (a) the people who are
stressed by intergroup interactions avoid them and (b)
the people who are not stressed by intergroup interac-
tions approach them because they are equipped to han-
dle any negativity that may arise (Page-Gould, 2012;
Page-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Paolini et al., in
press).2 Of course, when real-life intergroup interactions
are not easily avoidable, evidence suggests that they are
indeed more stressful than ingroup interactions (Shelton et
al., 2010; Trail, Shelton, & West, 2009). However, to the
extent that people can avoid intergroup interactions in
everyday life, then this avoidance will likely not occur ran-
domly (i.e., the people who elect to avoid will be those
with low intergroup contact and high intergroup anxiety,
whereas the people who choose to have intergroup inter-
actions will be people that tend to have more positive inter-
actions). Therefore, it is possible that natural (unavoidable)
intergroup interactions are just as stressful as laboratory-
observed intergroup interactions for people who are prone
to negative responses to intergroup interactions through
prejudice or intergroup anxiety, but these may be avoided
when feasible. Simply put, it may be that most naturally
occurring intergroup interactions are positive and facilitate
ongoing reductions in intergroup bias, because contact
begets contact, so they are occurring mainly among people
who elect to have those types of interactions.
Susceptibility to demand characteristics. In within-
subjects designs, participants have all the information
they need to guess the researcher's hypothesis because
they are presented with all the constructs that are rele-
vant to the hypothesis. In contrast, in between-subjects
designs, participants only know the conditions that they
were randomly assigned to receive. Thus, participants in
within-subjects research have greater amounts of infor-
mation, on the basis of which they are likely better able
to accurately guess the researcher's hypothesis. Correla-
tional research (i.e., in which there is no experimental
manipulation) is akin to a within-subjects design, as all
participants are exposed to the same information.
Applied to research on intergroup interactions and con-
tact, between-subjects designs do not give access to the
information needed to know that the intergroup context of
the social interaction or intergroup contact was

being systematically manipulated. It is more likely, then,
that participants may report less anxiety, less bias, and
more contact in within-subjects studies relative to between-
subjects studies because participants can more accurately
infer the hypotheses. However, accurate suspicion is cer-
tainly possible in between-subjects designs (Vorauer,
Martens, & Sasaki, 2009). All the same, it comes down to
information: The hypothesis in much of intergroup rela-
tions research is concealed because the research topic is
typically controversial. Participants have access to all varia-
tions of the independent variables in within-subjects
designs, but they will see at least one independent vari-
able as being invariant in between-subjects designs.
Research on intergroup interaction has relied less on

survey and within-subjects designs than research on inter-
group contact, despite plenty of examples of between-
subjects designs in intergroup contact research. Of course,
the measurement of contact itself cannot be solely attribut-
able to demand characteristics or controlled responding
because observer reports suggest that self-reports of inter-
group contact are accurate (Hewstone, Judd, & Sharp,
2011) and that socially desirable responding is a concern
in all studies in which intergroup bias is assessed. We sug-
gest, however, that socially desirable responding is greater
in survey and within-subjects studies, which are more com-
mon in the intergroup contact than intergroup interaction
literatures. Nevertheless, we want to emphasize that many
intergroup contact studies have used other methods than
self-reports (Barnard & Benn, 1987; Clunies Ross & O'Meara,
1989; Johnson & Johnson, 1985) and that not all intergroup
interaction studies take place in the laboratory (Shelton
et al., 2005, 2010).
Frequency
Researchers of intergroup interaction studies typically
observe intergroup interaction on a single occasion
(Avery et al., 2009; Blascovich et al., 2001; Hyers & Swim,
1998; Littleford et al., 2005; Shelton, 2003; Vorauer &
Kumhyr, 2001), whereas intergroup contact is typically
operationalized as the quantity of intergroup interactions
or even close cross-group relationships that a person has
or has had in his or her past (Islam & Hewstone, 1993;
Page-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Pettigrew, 1997;
Turner et al., 2007; K. West & Hewstone, 2012). Frequent
intergroup interactions may produce more positive indi-
vidual, interpersonal, and societal outcomes than occa-
sional intergroup interactions for a number of reasons.
Number of interactions.Intergroup interactions
manipulated in the laboratory could be a rare event in
the life of someone who is low in intergroup contact
while being more natural to someone who has a rela-
tively high degree of past intergroup contact. Naturally
occurring intergroup interactions are more likely for peo-
ple with a high degree of past contact. Therefore, experi-
ences during laboratory intergroup interactions may be
quite variable because they could be either a person's
first intergroup interaction or his or her thousandth inter-
group interaction. Supporting the idea that frequent
interactions facilitate the positive effects of intergroup
contact, researchers of studies involving multiple inter-
group interactions have observed a greater reduction in
intergroup bias compared with a single intergroup inter-
action (Barnard & Benn, 1987; Clunies Ross & O'Meara,
1989; Johnson & Johnson, 1985; Toosi, Babbit, Ambady,
& Sommers, 2012). Cross-group friendships, which by
definition involve multiple intergroup interactions as a
friendship develops, are especially effective in reducing
intergroup bias (Davies, Tropp, Aron, Pettigrew, & Wright,
2011). More frequent intergroup interactions may attenu-
ate the use of group stereotypes (Shelton & Richeson,
2006), encouraging more intimate and personalized inter-
actions and hence less intergroup bias (Brewer & Miller,
1984, 1988; Miller, 2002). Engaging in more frequent
intergroup interactions also equips people with the social
skills and resources to appraise intergroup interactions as
nonstressful (Mendes, Blascovich, Hunter, Lickel, & Jost,
2007), which can promote subsequent intergroup contact
and more positive intergroup relations (Page-Gould,
2012; Page-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Page-Gould et
al., 2008; Trawalter et al., 2009).
Interaction duration.Intergroup interaction studies
typically involve short interactions among group mem-
bers (e.g., often lasting less than 10 min; Avery et al.,
2009; Blascovich et al., 2001; Hyers & Swim, 1998; Little-
ford et al., 2005), whereas intergroup contact studies are
better able to measure contact among group members
that lasts for a longer period of time (e.g., meetings that
last for hours, long-term close relationships; Islam &
Hewstone, 1993; Pettigrew, 1997; K. West & Hewstone,
2012). Interacting with an outgroup member for a long
duration may result in less intergroup bias by facilitating
bonding (Wright, Aron, & Tropp, 2002; Wright, Brody, &
Aron, 2005) or the adoption of the outgroup member's
perspective, which is associated with lower intergroup
anxiety (Aberson & Haag, 2007). Relative to longer term
intergroup contact, an interaction lasting only a few min-
utes may not provide enough time to achieve these out-
comes. Although under certain circumstances less
intergroup bias has been observed following relatively
short intergroup interactions (Gaertner et al., 1999; Grack
& Richman, 1996), we suggest that longer duration inter-
actions are likely to have the most positive impact on
intergroup bias, especially when these interactions occur
repeatedly as per the preceding section on interaction
frequency. We expect that the relationship between
312 MacInnis, Page-Gould
interaction duration and intergroup bias is linear overall,
but we recognize that, like any time-based process (S. G.
West & Hepworth, 1991), this linear trend will only be
apparent in the long run, after short-term, periodic
increases and decreases have been taken into account.
Familiarity.
Intergroup interaction studies typically
involve an anticipated or actual interaction with an
unknown outgroup member (i.e., a stranger), whereas
intergroup contact measures do not commonly distin-
guish between contact with both known and unknown
outgroup members. Outcomes are more likely to be posi-
tive when the outgroup member is familiar because the
interaction partner is more readily predictable and inter-
pretable. A more predictable partner is less threatening
and less anxiety-provoking than an unpredictable out-
group member (Mendes et al., 2007). Moreover, when
people judge their current and previous intergroup con-
tact, they likely consider familiar people more than unfa-
miliar people, given the chronic salience of close others
(Andersen, Glassman, Chen, & Cole, 1995). Thus, research
on intergroup contact captures variance in partner famil-
iarity. For example, someone could have a lot of interre-
ligious contact because (a) he or she has family members
who practice different religions, and therefore he or she
interacts repeatedly with the same outgroup members, or
(b) he or she holds a retail job in a religiously diverse
community and interacts repeatedly with many different
outgroup strangers. By contrast, in intergroup interaction
research, the partner is almost always unfamiliar.
Experience.Participants in intergroup interaction stud-
ies may have less experience interacting with outgroup
members because the interaction could be one of their
first intergroup interactions. By default, participants who
report more contact in intergroup contact studies have
prior experience with intergroup interactions. Intergroup
experience may promote positive outcomes for individu-
als in new intergroup interactions by making these inter-
actions equally predictable as ingroup interactions. When
interactions are predictable versus unpredictable, they
are less demanding and less stressful (Bettencourt, Dill,
Greathouse, Charlton, & Mulholland, 1997; Mendes et al.,
2007). This may partially account for the increased anxi-
ety observed in intergroup interactions relative to inter-
group contact.
Outcome measures
Intergroup interaction and intergroup contact studies
typically are concerned with different overall questions,
and thus, different outcomes are assessed. First, research-
ers of intergroup interaction studies typically use state-
level outcome measures (e.g., measuring how anxious
participants feel during the interaction), whereas
researchers of intergroup contact studies typically use
trait-level measures (e.g., measuring participants' general
expectations of anxiety during intergroup interactions).
Second, researchers of intergroup interaction studies typ-
ically focus on self-relevant intrapsychic or individual
outcomes (e.g., one's emotional reactions), whereas
researchers of intergroup contact studies focus on other-
relevant or societal outcomes (e.g., intergroup attitudes).
Third, researchers of intergroup interaction studies typi-
cally compare these outcomes in intergroup interactions
with those observed in same-group interactions, but most
researchers of intergroup contact studies assess inter-
group contact without comparisons with ingroup con-
tact. Integrating across the literatures, participants may
experience changes in state affect during a single inter-
group interaction, but as a whole, intergroup interactions
may lessen anticipatory intergroup anxiety at the trait
level. That is, intergroup interactions may have short-
term, self-relevant costs but long-term, other-relevant
gains.
There are a number of notable exceptions to the typi-
cal set of outcome measures used in each literature. Many
researchers of intergroup interaction studies have
assessed trait-level or intergroup outcomes, and many
researchers of intergroup contact studies have assessed
state-level or intrapsychic outcomes. For example,
Sinclair, Lowery, Hardin, and Colangelo (2005) found that
interracial interactions reduced racial bias; Trawalter,
Adam, Chase-Lansdale, and Richeson (2012) found that
intergroup contact can be associated with increased per-
sonal stress; and Trail et al. (2009) found that students
engaging in intergroup versus same-group contact expe-
rienced less positive emotions. These findings suggest
that the typical outcome measures examined within each
literature may account for their seemingly paradoxical
findings.
Intergroup domain
Intergroup interactions typically involve an interaction
with a racial or ethnic outgroup member (for reviews, see
Shelton & Richeson, 2006; Shelton et al., 2006; Trawalter
et al., 2009; Vorauer, 2006), most often examining White­
Black interracial interactions (Toosi et al., 2012).
Intergroup contact studies, however, have examined con-
tact with a broader range of outgroup targets. In their
comprehensive meta-analysis of intergroup contact,
Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found that 51% of samples
examined contact with a racial or ethnic outgroup mem-
ber, whereas the remaining samples examined contact
with another type of outgroup member (e.g., including
contact with older adults, people with dissimilar sexual
orientation, people with mental illness, and people with
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 313
disabilities). However, the effect size for intergroup con-
tact was small and negative for all outgroup targets exam-
ined, with interracial contact having essentially the same
effect size (i.e., Pearson's r = -.21) as the effect size across
all forms of contact (i.e., r = -.21; Pettigrew & Tropp,
2006). Thus, it is possible that research in which intereth-
nic relations are examined is reasonably generalizable to
other intergroup domains.
The impact of target group may have downstream
consequences for the quality of intergroup interactions,
all the same. As laboratory intergroup interactions have
almost exclusively involved nonconcealable groups (e.g.,
ethnicity, sex), participants in these studies had immedi-
ate awareness of the intergroup nature of the interaction,
potentially evoking intergroup anxiety (Stephan &
Stephan, 1985, 1989) that would not exist as readily in the
case of concealable groups. When the intergroup nature
of an interaction is not readily apparent (e.g., sexual ori-
entation or religious outgroups), as may have been the
case for some interactions reported by participants in
intergroup contact studies, this interaction may be
approached as an ingroup interaction. Hence, the inter-
action may not generate intergroup anxiety and negativ-
ity, at least not upfront (Buck & Plant, 2011; Kaufman &
Libby, 2012; King, Reilly, & Hebl, 2008; but for an excep-
tion, see MacInnis & Hodson, 2014). It may also be that
interracial interactions are simply more stressful than
other types of intergroup interactions (Critcher, Mazziotta,
Dovidio, & Brown, in preparation). Regardless, the pro-
portion of different intergroup domains examined across
the intergroup interaction and intergroup contact litera-
tures may account for their differing conclusions.
Integrating the Literatures
Overall, the intergroup interaction literature demonstrates
that, in the short term, contact with outgroup members has
a negative impact on intergroup bias, producing height-
ened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance
(Shelton et al., 2009; Trawalter et al., 2009); however, the
intergroup contact literature demonstrates that intergroup
interactions have a positive impact on intergroup bias in
the long run, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and
lower prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Considering
the methodological differences between the two literatures
noted earlier, we introduce a novel model by which these
seemingly paradoxical findings can be unified. Specifically,
we propose that one's first intergroup interaction with a
stranger is anxiety-provoking, with some exceptions (e.g.,
those high in self-expansion motives; Wright et al., 2002),
consistent with the intergroup interaction literature (Littleford
et al., 2005; Stephan & Stephan, 1985, 1989), and this anxi-
ety leads to the avoidance of subsequent intergroup
contact (Gaertner & Dovidio, 2000; Plant & Devine, 2003;
Stephan, Ybarra, Martinez, Schwarzwald, & Tur-Kaspa,
1998). We propose that if subsequent intergroup interac-
tions occur, however, that stress and anxiety are progres-
sively reduced (Page-Gould et al., 2008; White &
Abu-Rayya, 2012). Engaging in these subsequent interac-
tions promotes the building of resources to cope with
stressful intergroup interactions (Mendes et al., 2002; Page-
Gould, 2012; Page-Gould, Mendes, & Major, 2010; Trawalter
et al., 2009) and increases the familiarity of intergroup
interactions, which also likely reduces the stress of inter-
group interactions (Mendes et al., 2007). At some point, a
threshold will be reached whereby a person's history of
intergroup interactions assumes the properties of inter-
group contact. That is, intergroup interactions eventually
produce positive outcomes, such as less intergroup anxi-
ety and more positive intergroup attitudes (Binder et al.,
2009; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006, 2008), and these positive
outcomes are maintained through the ongoing facilitation
of positive intergroup interactions by past intergroup
contact.
Essentially, we posit that a threshold in experience
with intergroup interactions is reached whereby the ini-
tially negative effect of intergroup interactions on inter-
group bias progressively approaches the inverse linear
relationship estimated from the intergroup contact litera-
ture (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Similar thresholds have
been described in the field of organizational behavior.
For example, according to critical mass theory, when a
minority group reaches a certain size (e.g., ranging from
10% to 35% of a larger society), a qualitative change
occurs whereby the previously conforming minority
group members become influential and assertive within
the larger society (Studlar & McAllister, 2002). Similarly,
some support has been demonstrated (P. B. Jackson,
Thoits, & Taylor, 1995; Stichman, Hassell, & Archbold,
2010) for tokenism theory (Kanter, 1977), which posits
that workplaces marked by group conflicts become
more harmonious when the proportion of employees
from historically underrepresented groups reaches a tip-
ping point of 15%. In the specific context of historically
male-dominated symphony orchestras, Allmendinger
and Hackman (1995) found that several outcomes,
including relationship quality, steadily worsened as the
proportion of women in the orchestra increased. As the
proportion of women approached a threshold of 50%,
however, orchestra functioning no longer decreased,
and for some outcome measures, it improved. Compar
able with these group composition thresholds, we pro-
pose that there are many objective and subjective factors
that lead to individual variance in the onset of the con-
tact threshold we describe, which provides many ave-
nues for future research.
314 MacInnis, Page-Gould
The Limiting Function of Intergroup
Interaction and Intergroup Contact
Ultimately, we posit that intergroup contact reflects the
state of intergroup bias as the number of intergroup inter-
actions approaches infinity. Pettigrew and Tropp (2006)
predicted that the impact of intergroup contact on preju-
dice reduction would eventually asymptote, essentially
reflecting the idea that intergroup contact can only keep
reducing prejudice while a person still has prejudice to
reduce. We build off this work by proposing that the linear
relationship between intergroup interactions and inter-
group bias is itself asymptotic. Specifically, as a person
continues to have more intergroup interactions, the rela-
tionship between this past contact and intergroup bias
takes the form of an oblique asymptote, which is a slanted
linear asymptote (Howison, 2005; see Figure 1). The
asymptote reflects the well-established negative associa-
tion between intergroup contact and intergroup bias (i.e.,
r = -.21; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), and the curve function
that approaches the asymptote reflects the volatile rela-
tionship between intergroup interactions and intergroup
bias when intergroup interactions are close to zero. When
intergroup interaction quantity is low, the association
between intergroup interactions and intergroup bias will
be quite variable. As intergroup interactions increase, the
association between intergroup interactions and inter-
group bias becomes more reliable and consistent with
relations observed in the intergroup contact literature.
For Figure 1, the asymptote is plotted with the
equation,
y Default Intergroup Bias
Contact Effect x
= ( ) +
( )× ,
where y represents intergroup bias; the intercept, Default
Intergroup Bias, is a constant that represents the default
level of intergroup bias in the absence of any intergroup
contact; and the Contact Effect is the slope, which repre-
sents the relationship between intergroup contact and
intergroup bias. For the purposes of this article, we
assume the Contact Effect is equivalent to the effect size
for contact that has been estimated through meta-analysis
(-.21; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Finally, x represents a
count of a person's lifetime intergroup interactions. The
intercept of the asymptote is expected to vary depending
on the intergroup bias outcome measure used (e.g.,
implicit attitudes, behavioral intentions) and its measure-
ment scale (e.g., bias measured with a 100-point feeling
thermometer may use an intercept of 35; bias measured
with an implicit associations test may use an intercept of
D = .7). Given its meta-analytic origins, we chose to use
Pettigrew and Tropp's (2006) well-established -.21 corre-
lation that represents the small but reliable association
between intergroup contact and prejudice as the stan-
dardized slope of intergroup interactions predicting inter-
group bias. Of course, the asymptote may vary when
zeroing in on a specific intergroup domain (e.g., r = -.27
for contact with heterosexual­homosexual people; r =
-.24 for contact with people with physical disabilities;
and r = -.18 for contact with older adults; Pettigrew &
Tropp, 2006). However, we chose a slope of -.21 for
Figure 1, given that it represents the mean effect size
across group domains, recognizing the limitation that
interracial interactions were examined in 51% of the stud-
ies in Pettigrew and Tropp's meta-analysis. Further, we
recognize that prejudice is only one component of inter-
group bias (e.g., stereotyping and discrimination being
other components) and that the slope of the asymptote
may also vary depending on the measure of intergroup
bias used. Although we recognize that differences in
default levels of intergroup bias will exist across different
types of outcomes, we expect that the association between
intergroup contact and other forms of intergroup bias is
generally similar (i.e., reliably negative and small).
After hundreds of studies and thousands of partici-
pants, we believe that the fields of intergroup contact and
intergroup interaction are both sufficiently rich. At this
Fig. 1.Graph representing the relationship between intergroup inter-
actions and intergroup bias as an oblique asymptote. The dashed line
represents the oblique asymptote. The dotted line represents the curve
function under good conditions (e.g., multiple high-quality interactions
with the same outgroup member with little time between interactions).
The dotted-and-dashed line represents the curve under relatively poorer
conditions (e.g., superficial interactions with different group members
with a long time period between interactions). The solid line represents
the curve function on average.
(1)
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 315
point, researchers in the field can benefit from formaliz-
ing our knowledge. This equation could be used to pro-
spectively predict intergroup bias at varying amounts of
intergroup interactions. However, as represented by the
curve function that approaches the oblique asymptote,
we expect that the relationship between intergroup inter-
actions and intergroup bias is neither linear nor homosce-
dastic, such that early intergroup interactions are likely to
produce more variable and more negative individual and
societal outcomes. Thus, we propose that the true rela-
tionship between intergroup interactions and intergroup
bias is curvilinear, approaching a linear relationship as
intergroup interactions approach infinity. The contact
threshold is the point at which the tangents of this curve
function become effectively parallel to the oblique
asymptote.
We hypothesize a general form for the curve function
to be as follows:
y Contact Effect x Default Intergroup Bias
x Rate x
= × + ( )
× + -
[
] / (
2
1
1),
where y and x represent the same variables as in Equation
1 (i.e., intergroup bias and the count of a person's life-
time intergroup interactions, respectively), and Rate rep-
resents the rate at which intergroup interactions
progressively approach the asymptote. This rate param-
eter is analogous to the degree to which a single interac-
tion leads to a proportional decrease in intergroup bias,
and we suspect that the rate parameter is most directly
affected by contact quality, although we later discuss the
role of contact quality along with other factors affecting
the rate parameter. Figure 1 depicts this curvilinear func-
tion with three different rate parameters of Rate = 10
(dotted line), Rate = 100 (solid line), and Rate = 500 (dot-
ted-and-dashed line) to represent higher, average, and
lower quality interactions leading to faster, average, and
slower routes to the contact threshold, respectively. That
is, each curve will eventually become effectively parallel
to the -.21 slope but each at a different rate. Each curve
can be considered effectively parallel at the point where
the discrepancy between the curve and the asymptote
cannot be disambiguated from the reliability of the mea-
sures used. Although we believe that interaction quantity
and quality cannot be divorced from one another, with
each dimension augmenting and amplifying the other,
we expect the rate parameter to be heavily influenced by
quality of interactions. If interactions are of higher qual-
ity, the rate parameter will be smaller; if interactions are
of lower quality, the rate parameter will be larger. All the
same, our model predicts that being "high" on quantity or
quality can result in reaching the contact threshold, even
in the absence of the other (but see Barlow et al., 2012;
Shook & Fazio, 2011; Stark, Flache, & Veenstra, 2013;
Trail et al., 2009). However, we expect that the contact
threshold will be reached most quickly when both con-
tact quantity and quality are optimized, which may be
why close intergroup relationships, such as cross-group
friendship, are more strongly related to intergroup con-
tact (Davies et al., 2011).
The numerical constants in the curve function also
have semantic meaning and should be amended through
empiricism. Two of the numbers are necessary to force
the function to approach the asymptote as intergroup
interactions increase to infinity: -0.21 is the slope of the
asymptote, and we have plotted our example figures with
an outcome measure on a 0­100 scale of intergroup bias
and with 35 as the intercept of the asymptote, arbitrarily
on the basis of values reported on a feeling thermometer
by Dasgupta and Greenwald (2001). The denominator in
Equation 2 represents the stochastic nature of intergroup
interactions. By subtracting the constant of "1" from the
current number of intergroup interactions, two specific
purposes are served: (a) A vertical asymptote is created
at the first intergroup interaction, suggesting that we can-
not predict how the first intergroup interaction a person
ever has will relate to his or her intergroup bias; (b) sym-
bolically, this also represents that the current intergroup
interaction is a function of the number of intergroup
interactions a person has previously had in his or her
lifetime.
Note that we are not necessarily proposing an asymp-
tote at "zero" prejudice like Pettigrew and Tropp (2006)
did. Although we expect that the zero point is rarely
crossed, we want to allow for the possibility that inter-
group bias and perceived group membership can entirely
shift in favor of outgroups (e.g., expatriates who chose to
live in a different culture solely for internal reasons). Our
model predicts that the state at which a person begins to
ally with outgroups more than ingroups will only be
observed at the higher end of the intergroup contact con-
tinuum; however, we suspect that this exceptional behav-
ior is driven as much if not more by social experiences
with ingroup members than with outgroup members.
Altogether, the curve function (Equation 2) reflects the
hypothesized relationship between intergroup interac-
tions and intergroup bias in natural data, and the oblique
asymptote (Equation 1) represents the relationship
between intergroup interactions and intergroup bias as
intergroup interactions approach infinity. We generally
plot these functions on an axis representing contact
quantity because intergroup interactions are discrete,
observable events in a person's life. However, we expect
that contact quality, which is inherently subjective, is one
of the primary contributors to the rate parameter in the
curve function. Putting these ideas together, using our
model we predict that contact quantity is the primary
dimension that determines whether a person's intergroup
(2)
316 MacInnis, Page-Gould
interactions reflect processes of intergroup contact, but
contact quality more strongly determines how each inter-
group interaction affects intergroup bias and advances a
person toward the contact threshold. Future research is
necessary to determine factors influencing the speed at
which one reaches the contact threshold (i.e., when the
slope of the curve becomes almost parallel to the oblique
asymptote) and, thus, to determine these actual values.
Next, we discuss such potential factors as well as means
by which to detect the threshold itself.
Exploring the Contact Threshold:
Avenues for Future Research
Our proposed model introduces a variety of new ques-
tions for intergroup researchers. To bridge the gap
between the intergroup interaction and intergroup con-
tact literatures, we need to explore the nature of the con-
tact threshold. As a starting point, we introduce three
specific research questions for future examination, pro-
viding potential, falsifiable answers to these questions.
What factors influence when the
contact threshold is reached?
Next, we identify potential factors that influence how
many intergroup interactions a person must have before
more intergroup interactions have positive, rather than
negative, individual, interpersonal, and societal inter-
group bias outcomes, such as lower prejudice, lower
intergroup interaction avoidance, and lower intergroup
anxiety. We discuss each factor independently, but we
recognize that these factors probably covary and may
interact with one another to have an impact on the con-
tact threshold.
Factors expected to influence the Rate parameter of
Equation 2.
Artificial versus real-life setting. We speculate that the
contact threshold can be achieved through either labo-
ratory-based or real-world intergroup interactions. How-
ever, given the quantity and quality of interactions that
are likely required to give a person relatively high inter-
group contact, the contact threshold is likely to be reached
more readily when interactions occur in real-world versus
laboratory settings. Although laboratory-based interactions
afford empirical control, they also are more contrived, are
more unpredictable, and, as noted earlier, may be more
anxiety-provoking. Real-world intergroup interactions have
the possibility of being chosen by each interaction partner,
whereas laboratory interaction partners are rarely chosen
by the participant. In addition, it is resource-intensive to
manipulate multiple intergroup interactions in the labora-
tory. However, it is more difficult to manipulate intergroup
interactions in the field, limiting causal inferences on the
impact of intergroup interaction versus any social interac-
tion. Overall, therefore, a combination of both laboratory
and real-world intergroup interactions may provide the
most accurate picture of intergroup interactions.
Future researchers should unpack the contact quantity
question systematically to answer the question of the
amount of interactions required before a change on inter-
group bias is observed (i.e., the point at which the contact
threshold is reached), considering moderating factors such
as laboratory-based and real-world settings. We expect con-
tact setting to impact the Rate parameter in Equation 2.
Specifically, we expect that fewer real-world versus labora-
tory-based interactions would be required, but this remains
an open question. Researchers may identify procedures
wherein laboratory-based interactions can result in a rapid
reaching of the contact threshold, which could be applied
as a prejudice intervention strategy. For example, it may be
necessary to manipulate the quality of laboratory interac-
tions (Page-Gould et al., 2008) for laboratory intergroup
interactions to affect intergroup bias.
Time between interactions.Although it has not been
addressed in the extant literature, we propose that, in
addition to the amount of interactions, the time between
these interactions is an important factor contributing to
when the contact threshold is reached. We speculate that
a shorter time interval between intergroup interactions
results in fewer intergroup interactions being needed to
reach the contact threshold. If multiple intergroup inter-
actions occur within a short time interval wherein the
initial interactions are still accessible in working mem-
ory, subsequent interactions may be more familiar and
predictable and, hence, less stressful (see Mendes et al.,
2007) than the same number of intergroup interactions
that were separated by greater expanses of time. Given
familiarity and predictability, resources to effectively
deal with an intergroup interaction and to appraise it
as nonstressful are likely to be built more quickly, and
hence the contact threshold is likely to be reached more
quickly. We suspect that even if there are days or weeks
between intergroup interactions, the contact threshold
will be reachable, but the point at which the threshold
is reached will depend on between-interactions time
intervals. When the time between intergroup interac-
tions moves beyond weeks and spans months or years,
we expect that intergroup interactions would remain
relatively unfamiliar and that each intergroup interaction
would be as stressful as the last. Extended time inter-
vals between intergroup interactions likely render the
accumulation of resources to effectively manage inter-
group interactions more difficult. Indeed, those report-
ing rare intergroup interactions report more intergroup
bias (Islam & Hewstone, 1993; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006).
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 317
Thus, it is possible that people who engage in intergroup
interactions only every few months or years may never
reach the contact threshold, such that they continually
have anxiety-prone intergroup interactions that feed
avoidance of future intergroup interactions.
We anticipate that time between interactions will influ-
ence the Rate parameter of Equation 2. We hypothesize that
the relationship between inter-interaction interval and ben-
efits that come from accumulated intergroup interactions
will be related to normal processes of memory decay. Using
experimental or daily diary methods, researchers could
examine the impact of time intervals between intergroup
interactions on intergroup bias. Shorter versus longer time
intervals between intergroup interactions may result in a
quicker reduction of intergroup bias, indicating a faster
reaching of the contact threshold. Consistently, with espe-
cially extended time intervals between intergroup interac-
tions, intergroup bias may be unchanged, indicating a
failure to reach the contact threshold. It is also possible,
however, that the contact threshold is robust to these time
intervals and that the threshold will be reached by merely
engaging in multiple intergroup interactions, regardless of
the interval between interactions.
Factor expected to influence the x parameter of
Equation 2: Number of interactions. It is almost a
certainty that multiple intergroup interactions are neces-
sary to arrive at the contact threshold. For most people,
the first intergroup interaction will produce at least some
intergroup anxiety, given that the first intergroup interac-
tion represents an unfamiliar and potentially threatening
situation (Mendes et al., 2007; Stephan & Stephan, 1985,
2000). The degree to which a person's first intergroup
interaction is threatening probably highly depends on
the degree of stigma involved in the intergroup domain
(Blascovich et al., 2001). We propose that the specific
number range or proportion of intergroup interactions
(i.e., out of all social interactions) required to reach the
contact threshold can be identified by conducting inter-
mediate and long-term longitudinal work that has
enough resolution to observe the number of intergroup
interactions that an individual has. In laboratory or field
contexts, the number of intergroup interactions that
have occurred before a change is observed in intergroup
bias (e.g., intergroup anxiety, prejudice) will provide
insight into the number or proportion of intergroup
interactions required to reach the contact threshold.
There is likely a minimum number of intergroup interac-
tions that a person must have before his or her history
of intergroup interactions assumes the properties of
intergroup contact.
One initial guess at the necessary number of intergroup
interactions before a change in intergroup behavior is
observed is three intergroup interactions. Page-Gould et al.
(2008) found that implicitly biased participants exhibited
physiological stress to an initial intergroup interaction with
an ethnic outgroup stranger, but they did not respond with
physiological stress to two subsequent intergroup interac-
tions with the same person. Furthermore, after engaging in
these three intergroup interactions, participants who were
initially prejudiced initiated more intergroup interactions--
responses consistent with decreased intergroup bias. Of
course, Page-Gould et al. (2008) examined intergroup inter-
actions that were relatively long (i.e., each interaction was 1
hr) and designed to promote interpersonal closeness
through self-disclosure (Aron, Melinat, Aron, Vallone, &
Bator, 1997), thereby amplifying the normal development of
familiarity. In addition, each intergroup interaction was
invariantly 1 week apart, so inferences cannot be made
about the impact of the timespan between interactions on
the contact threshold. The number or proportion of inter-
group interactions necessary to reach the contact threshold
will likely depend on the duration and quality of the inter-
actions, with more short, superficial interactions being
required than long, intimate interactions. Regardless, initial
research in which multiple intergroup interactions are
examined suggests that positive outcomes from intergroup
interactions may appear between the first and second inter-
group interactions, assuming those interactions facilitate
closeness and are 1 week apart. These past findings likely
reflect the earliest stage in the development of an ongoing
relationship with an outgroup member and, thus, may pro-
vide a good starting point for examining the point at which
the contact threshold is reached. Future researchers examin-
ing the number of interactions should also vary whether
multiple interactions occur with the same outgroup mem-
ber or a series of outgroup strangers. The number of inter-
actions is the x parameter of Equation 2.
Factor expected to influence the slope of the asymp-
tote: Intergroup domain. The contact threshold we
describe refers to outgroups in general. We recognize,
however, that the contact threshold may differ by inter-
group domain (e.g., race, sexual orientation). It may even
be necessary to calculate a different contact threshold for
each specific group domain (e.g., an interracial contact
threshold, an intersexual orientation threshold). We
expect that different intergroup domains would moderate
the slope of the asymptote itself (i.e., having an impact
on the Contact Effect parameter). Although our focus is
on a general contact threshold, we believe it would be
fruitful for future researchers to examine specific group
domains separately as well.
Factors expected to have multiple influences.
Form of contact. Intergroup interactions can take many
forms. Imagined contact (i.e., mentally simulating positive
contact with outgroup members; Crisp & Turner, 2012),
318 MacInnis, Page-Gould
extended contact (i.e., knowledge of ingroup members
who are friends with outgroup members; Wright, Aron,
McLaughlin-Volpe, & Ropp, 1997), and media contact
(i.e., viewing or reading about positive intergroup con-
tact in the media; Ortiz & Harwood, 2007) represent
indirect forms of contact, with more substantial forms of
contact including direct, face-to-face intergroup interac-
tions and online intergroup contact (MacInnis & Hodson,
2014). We expect that the more psychologically investing
the form of contact, the faster the contact threshold will
be reached, with direct contact representing the fastest
route. Engaging in multiple forms of contact versus only
one form may also positively impact the rate at which
the threshold is reached. We anticipate that contact form
will have an impact on the asymptote itself or the Rate
parameter in Equation 2, but these are empirical ques-
tions. Future researchers can compare the influence of
these different forms of contact on the contact threshold.
Familiarity/experience.
As noted earlier, multiple
intergroup interactions are required to reach the con-
tact threshold whereby intergroup interactions assume
the properties of intergroup contact. These interactions,
however, may take three possible forms: (a) multiple
interactions with the same outgroup member, (b) mul-
tiple interactions with different members of the same
outgroup, and (c) multiple interactions with different
members of different outgroups. We predict that each of
these forms of intergroup interactions will result in the
contact threshold being reached but that multiple interac-
tions with the same outgroup member will produce the
largest and most positive effect on intergroup bias, repre-
senting the fastest route to the threshold. Multiple inter-
actions with the same outgroup member likely increase
familiarity and experience such that the outgroup mem-
ber becomes more predictable and hence less threat-
ening (Mendes et al., 2007). Outgroup members likely
become more familiar and predictable through Forms b
and c of intergroup interaction as well, but we expect
that this process occurs more quickly through Form a.
Indeed, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found generalization
patterns whereby interactions with single outgroup mem-
bers are associated with less bias toward the outgroup
as a whole (relevant to Form b), and interactions with
outgroup members are associated with less bias toward
other outgroups (relevant to Form c). These generaliza-
tion or "secondary transfer" effects, however, are often
limited to similar or related outgroups (Pettigrew, 2009).
Further, Pettigrew and Tropp (2006) found that the ame-
liorative effects of intergroup contact on intergroup bias
were strongest for intergroup friendships, which involve
repeated interactions with the same outgroup member
(relevant to Form a).
Cross-group friendships are widely recognized as
powerful means by which to reduce intergroup bias
(Davies et al., 2011). Outgroup friends may represent
positive exemplars of outgroup members that modify ini-
tial bias toward the outgroup. When an outgroup friend
is made, one has an outgroup member whom they asso-
ciate with acceptance, positive affect, and positive atti-
tudes (Mendoza-Denton, Page-Gould, & Pietrzak, 2006).
This new information is likely to replace previous nega-
tive information about the outgroup (Wright et al., 1997).
Thus, multiple interactions with the same outgroup mem-
ber that result in a cross-group friendship may induce a
change whereby intergroup interactions are less strongly
associated with bias and stress. Indeed, having a cross-
race friend predicts less discomfort in everyday interra-
cial interactions, such that comfort in cross-race
interactions was on par with comfort levels reported in
same-race interactions (Cook et al., 2012). The contact
threshold is likely to be reached sooner with this unique
form of intergroup interaction relative to other forms.
Researchers can examine the degree to which engag-
ing in interactions with the same outgroup member, mul-
tiple members of the same outgroup, or multiple members
of different outgroups has an impact on the point at
which the contact threshold is reached. This may have an
impact on the intercept (Default Intergroup Bias) or Rate
parameters of Equation 2, or it may have an impact on
the way that the x-axis is operationalized in both equa-
tions. As we speculate, multiple interactions with the
same individual may represent the fastest route to the
contact threshold. Of course, multiple interactions with
different members of the same outgroup, or multiple
interactions with different members of different out-
groups, may allow the contact threshold to be reached
just as quickly. Alternatively, it is possible that engaging
in a combination of all three intergroup interaction forms
rather than only one form allows the contact threshold to
be reached most quickly. Future laboratory experiments,
diary studies, and field studies are necessary to examine
these possibilities.
Individual differences.Individual differences, which
can strongly influence both intergroup bias and inter-
group contact (Hewstone, Rubin, & Willis, 2002; Hodson,
Costello, & MacInnis, 2013), are also likely to influence
the point at which the contact threshold is reached. We
expect these individual differences to have an impact on
not only the Rate parameter of Equation 2 but also the
intercept (Default Intergroup Bias).
Two individual differences that have been identified as
strong predictors of intergroup bias and moderators of the
relationship between intergroup contact and intergroup
bias are likely to be especially influential: right-wing
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 319
authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation
(SDO; Hodson et al., 2013). RWA is characterized by con-
ventionalism, submission to authority, and aggression
toward norm violators (Altemeyer, 1996), whereas SDO is
characterized by the support of group hierarchies and
group inequality (Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle,
1994). Although the motivational goals underlying preju-
dice differ for those relatively high in RWA or SDO
(Duckitt, 2005), in general, individuals relatively high in
RWA or SDO tend to avoid interacting with outgroup
members, preferring instead to interact with similar others
(Hodson et al., 2013). However, when contact with out-
group members is unavoidable, it is associated with sig-
nificantly lower intergroup bias for those high in RWA
(Dhont & Van Hiel, 2009; Hodson, Harry, & Mitchell,
2009) and for those high in SDO (Dhont & Van Hiel, 2009;
Hodson, 2008; but for an exception, see Asbrock, Christ,
Duckitt, & Sibley, 2012). In fact, it has been suggested that
intergroup contact best reduces prejudice among those
high in RWA or SDO (Hodson et al., 2013). That is, inter-
group contact is most beneficial to those who have the
most to gain: those who are prone to prejudice.
These findings suggest, on the one hand, that it may
take longer for the contact threshold to be reached
among people high in RWA or SDO, given that these
individuals avoid interacting with outgroup members. If
there are no intergroup interactions or only very rare
intergroup interactions, it is unlikely that the contact
threshold will be reached. On the other hand, however,
given that contact is strongly associated with less inter-
group bias among those high in RWA or SDO (Hodson et
al., 2013), only a small amount of interactions may be
required to reach the contact threshold for these indi-
viduals. A third possibility is that the contact threshold
can never truly be reached among those high in RWA or
SDO. Whereas intergroup bias is reduced more so for
these individuals relative to the reduction in bias observed
for people low in RWA or SDO or people high in RWA or
SDO who do not engage in contact, intergroup contact
may not be associated with low intergroup bias for those
high in RWA or SDO in an absolute sense. That is,
repeated interactions may result in a relative reduction in
intergroup bias, but a complete lack of bias or positivity
toward the outgroup (i.e., the contact threshold) may
never be achieved, given the inherent susceptibility of
these individuals to intergroup bias.
It is imperative that these possibilities be reconciled to
understand the impact of these individual differences on
the point at which the contact threshold whereby inter-
group interactions assume the properties of intergroup
contact is reached. This research will be especially diffi-
cult in naturalistic settings, given the tendency of people
high in RWA or SDO to avoid outgroup members (Hodson
et al., 2013). However, experimental studies, or studies of
environments in which intergroup interaction is unavoid-
able, will be informative. Researchers can investigate the
amount of intergroup interactions required among those
high in RWA or SDO before a qualitative reduction in
intergroup bias is observed. Future researchers can also
examine other individual differences related to bias or
intergroup contact that may have an impact on the point
wherein the contact threshold is reached, such as open-
ness to experience (Hodson, Hogg, & MacInnis, 2009),
conservatism (Van Hiel, Pandelaere, & Duriez, 2004), or
need for self-expansion (Wright et al., 2002).
What observations can be used to
identify when the contact threshold
has been reached?
In addition to determining factors influencing the point at
which the contact threshold is reached, it is important to
uncover observable means by which to identify exactly
when the threshold has been reached.
Quantitative observations. Quantitatively, the contact
threshold has been reached when reductions in inter-
group bias as a function of intergroup contact are not
significantly different from a standardized slope of -.21.
A t value can be hand-calculated from the results of a
regression equation. Assuming the appropriate data have
been collected, intergroup bias can be regressed on the
number of intergroup interactions, and the unstandard-
ized slope of intergroup interactions and its standard
error should be saved. Normally, the unstandardized
slope is divided by its standard error to obtain a t statistic
that can be used to test whether the slope is significantly
different from zero. Thus, to determine whether the slope
is significantly different from -.21, this value should be
subtracted from the unstandardized slope, and this differ-
ence would be divided by the standard error to obtain a
t value for this test. The probability of observing this t
value can be obtained with the same degrees of freedom
that were used to estimate this slope in the original
regression, although this approach would only be legiti-
mate in sample sizes large enough to detect a very small
effect (J. Cohen, 1992). Bayesian linear modeling can
also be used to estimate the slope given an observed set
of data, and this approach would be preferable in small
to moderate sized samples. In this case, the researcher
would conclude that the contact threshold had been
reached if the 95% highest posterior density interval
derived from Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo simula-
tions of the slope did not include -.21.
Qualitative observations.Reaching the contact thresh-
old likely involves a number of qualitative changes in a per-
son, whereby intergroup interactions no longer produce
320 MacInnis, Page-Gould
intergroup bias and may even promote positivity toward
the outgroup. There are likely identifiable means to pin-
point when this shift has occurred or is imminent. Next,
we discuss two possible means to determine that the
contact threshold has been reached.
Initiating contact.One behavioral "marker" demon-
strating that the contact threshold has been reached is
the initiation of intergroup interactions. Individuals high
in intergroup anxiety and intergroup bias generally are
unlikely to initiate contact with outgroup members (J. W.
Jackson & Poulsen, 2005; Stephan et al., 1998). However,
once intergroup bias begins to decrease with succes-
sive intergroup interactions, a person is likely to become
more comfortable initiating intergroup interactions. Self-
expansion theory purports that people are motivated to
"expand" the self to include resources, identities, and
perspectives that will enhance their self-efficacy and per-
sonal value (Aron, Norman, & Aron, 1998). This theory
has been extended to the intergroup domain, such that
developing closeness with outgroup members and includ-
ing outgroup members in the self can represent a means
of self-expansion (Wright et al., 2002). One likely has to
reach a point in which connecting with outgroup mem-
bers represents a worthwhile means of self-expansion,
however. The contact threshold may be this point. That
is, once bias begins to dissipate following multiple inter-
group interactions, one may seek out interactions with
outgroup members as a means of self-expansion. Future
researchers may investigate this possibility by measuring
who initiates daily social interactions.
Viewing outgroup members as friends or potential
friends.
Another possible indicator that the contact
threshold is reached is that outgroup members become
viewed as friends or potential friends. Pettigrew (1998)
suggested the opportunity for friendship as an essen-
tial condition for intergroup contact. When outgroup
members are viewed as potential friends, subsequent
intergroup interactions are more likely, providing more
opportunity to reduce intergroup bias and to maintain
positive intergroup attitudes (Pettigrew, 1998). Feelings of
friendship or closeness with outgroup members have also
been described as the means by which contact reduces
intergroup bias (Wright et al., 2005). At least some initial
intergroup interactions would likely be required before
outgroup members are viewed as potential friends,
and indeed we have argued in this article that repeated
friendly interactions with the same outgroup member
would produce a relatively faster reaching of the contact
threshold. Further, it may be that a defining characteristic
of the contact threshold is viewing outgroup members
as potential friends. Once this occurs, future intergroup
interactions are unlikely to be plagued by intergroup bias
but instead to be approached with positivity (i.e., the
contact threshold is reached). Future researchers could
test this speculation by asking about friendship potential
when measuring intergroup interactions or contact.
Do the effects of reaching the contact
threshold disappear if intergroup
contact is ceased?
One interesting question for future research concerns
whether the effects of reaching the contact threshold are
permanent. If intergroup contact decreases significantly
or ceases completely (e.g., if a person moves from a
diverse to nondiverse area), the effects of the contact
threshold may be lost over time. That is, ongoing inter-
group interactions may be required to maintain the con-
tact threshold. Without regular intergroup interactions, a
person may return to his or her original, prethreshold
levels of intergroup bias--or the effects of the contact
threshold may be permanent. Three possible answers to
this question are discussed next.
The effects of the contact threshold would disap-
pear completely. It is possible that if intergroup contact
is ceased, the effects of the contact threshold would dis-
appear. That is, a person may reach the contact threshold
by partaking in multiple intergroup interactions but even-
tually return to initial levels of intergroup bias if inter-
group interactions stopped altogether. If this person then
resumed intergroup interactions after a period of no
intergroup interactions, just as many interactions as were
originally required to reach the contact threshold may be
needed again. The ideal means to test this possibility
would be longitudinal work in which researchers follow
people over many years or cross-sectional work in which
researchers examine people who have recently moved
between geographical areas that differ in diversity. If the
intergroup bias of those who significantly reduce or
cease intergroup contact completely returns to baseline
levels, this possibility would be supported.
The effects of the contact threshold would not com-
pletely disappear and would be recovered quickly.
Another possibility is that once the contact threshold is
reached, an individual will never return to his or her orig-
inal level of intergroup bias, even if he or she ceases
intergroup contact completely. The effects of the contact
threshold may remain intact or decay only somewhat,
given that one would likely retain a behavioral script for
intergroup interactions (Abelson, 1981; Husnu & Crisp,
2010; Schank & Abelson, 1977) in procedural memory.
Procedural memory is relatively robust to decay (M. D.
Cohen & Bacdayan, 1994). Thus, even after ceasing
Reconciling a Paradox in Intergroup Relations 321
intergroup contact, one would maintain the resources to
evaluate intergroup interactions as predictable and non-
stressful and continue to view outgroup members as
potential friends. In this way, once the contact threshold
is reached, intergroup interaction may be something like
riding a bicycle--one never forgets how to do so effec-
tively. This could be investigated through longitudinal
work. If the intergroup bias of those having previously
reached the contact threshold is unchanged or changed
only slightly when intergroup contact is significantly
reduced or ceased, then this possibility would be sup-
ported. Further, in the event that the effects of the contact
threshold decay somewhat, they may be recovered
quickly similar to "savings" effects of memory (Nelson,
1978). That is, when intergroup contact ceases, a person
who had previously reached the contact threshold may
reach it more quickly when resuming intergroup interac-
tions than a person who has never reached the threshold.
This could also be examined in longitudinal work.
It depends. The degree to which the effects of the con-
tact threshold endure when intergroup contact is ceased
may depend on several factors. First, this could depend
on individual differences. Those individuals particularly
prone to intergroup bias (e.g., those high in RWA or SDO;
Duckitt, 2005) may be more susceptible to returning to
their original levels of intergroup bias when intergroup
contact ceases than those who are not especially prone
to bias. These bias-prone individuals may revert back to
original intergroup bias levels after only a short period
without intergroup contact. Another individual difference
that may be relevant is motivation to respond without
prejudice (Plant & Devine, 1998). Individuals high on this
construct actively strive to appear nonprejudiced for
internal or external reasons. Such individuals may be
especially motivated, when reaching the contact thresh-
old, to actively maintain the positive effects obtained.
Thus, those higher on motivation to control prejudice
may be more likely to retain the positive effects of the
contact threshold even in the absence of intergroup con-
tact. By contrast, the construct of motivation to respond
with prejudice has begun to be recently explored
(Forscher & Devine, under review). For individuals who
are highly motivated to be prejudiced toward an out-
group for either normative or personal reasons, the con-
tact threshold may be particularly permeable.
The degree to which the effects of the contact thresh-
old endure following a stoppage of intergroup contact
may also depend on whether an individual engages in
alternative forms of contact. Although environments
completely devoid of any type of intergroup interactions
are likely rare, engaging in some alternative form of con-
tact may serve to maintain the positive effects of the con-
tact threshold for people with a complete lack of
intergroup interaction. Imagined contact (Crisp & Turner,
2012), extended contact (Wright et al., 1997), and media
contact (Ortiz & Harwood, 2007) may prove effective in
reducing intergroup bias when there are no opportuni-
ties for direct intergroup contact. An individual who
engages in one or more of these alternative forms of
contact may be more likely to maintain the positive
effects of the contact threshold. Again, longitudinal work
in which researchers follow those who have reached the
contact threshold will be necessary to investigate these
possibilities.
Limitations
There are a number of limitations existing across the
intergroup interaction and intergroup contact literatures
that warrant examination. First, although wide varieties
of social groups have been examined, the largest propor-
tion of work across the literatures has focused on racial
or ethnic groups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006; Toosi et al.,
2012). The field would benefit from more balanced cov-
erage of social groups to further expand the understand-
ing of intergroup interactions in general. Second,
researchers of both intergroup interaction and intergroup
contact studies primarily use majority group members as
participants. Although this is likely a more practical
approach, it is incomplete given that the association
between intergroup contact and intergroup bias is sub-
stantially weaker among minority group members (Tropp
& Pettigrew, 2005). Our model is limited by the research
in which it is grounded. Additional research is necessary
to examine intergroup interactions from the perspective
of minority group members.
Although we point out discrepancies between the
intergroup interaction and intergroup contact literatures,
it would be inaccurately simplistic to infer that one litera-
ture is "right" and one literature is "wrong." Indeed, both
literatures have produced valuable and informative
results, with each perspective providing its own unique
contributions to the understanding of intergroup pro-
cesses. A greater proportion of intergroup interaction
studies, for example, have been experimental and have
provided a degree of control and causal inference that is
impossible in cross-sectional studies. Researchers of a
greater proportion of intergroup contact studies, how-
ever, have assessed contact in everyday, natural settings
that provide ecological validity that is impossible to
obtain in laboratory studies. Each literature provides
findings that we consider true, but these findings are spe-
cific to the given context in which they are situated. That
is, the findings of the intergroup interaction literature are,
for the most part, specific to first-time, short interactions
with an unknown outgroup member. In the same vein,
the findings of the intergroup contact literature are, for
322 MacInnis, Page-Gould
the most part, specific to longer term, more frequent, and
familiar intergroup interactions. As a result, it may be
ineffective to extrapolate the findings from intergroup
interaction studies to intergroup contact contexts and
vice versa. For example, it cannot be assumed, on the
basis of the intergroup interaction literature, that a per-
son's interaction with his or her long-term, cross-group
friend will produce greater anxiety than interactions with
a same-group stranger. Likewise, it cannot be assumed,
on the basis of the intergroup contact literature, that a
person's first interaction with an outgroup member is
going to immediately result in less prejudice toward that
outgroup. In the absence of recognizing the divide
between the intergroup interaction and intergroup con-
tact literatures, such inferential errors are common.
Is Reaching the Threshold Enough?
When reaching the contact threshold, intergroup interac-
tions are associated with lower intergroup bias, consistent
with the intergroup contact literature (Pettigrew & Tropp,
2006). With intergroup contact considered by some as "our
best hope" for improving intergroup relations (Wright et al.,
2005, p. 119), reaching the contact threshold might be con-
sidered an ideal outcome. However, assuming an overall
goal of intergroup harmony, is reaching the threshold
enough? Intergroup contact is not exclusively associated
with positive outcomes. As noted earlier, the association
between intergroup contact and intergroup bias is weaker
for minority group members. Further, given its tendency to
blur group differences, intergroup contact can reduce the
likelihood that disadvantaged group members will engage
in collective action, which is a critical strategy for achieving
social change (Saguy, Tausch, Dovidio, & Pratto, 2009;
Wright & Lubensky, 2008). Thus, reaching the contact
threshold may have a small positive impact on bias but
nonetheless maintain group inequality.
For intergroup contact to not undermine collective
action, an explicit recognition of intergroup inequality as
illegitimate during intergroup interaction appears to be key
(Becker, Wright, Lubensky, & Zhou, 2013). We speculate
that this is most likely to occur naturally in cross-group
friendships, which involve a strong interpersonal connec-
tion, sense of shared reality, and inclusion of other in the
self (Davies, Wright, Aron, & Comeau, 2013; Page-Gould,
Mendoza-Denton, Alegre, & Siy, 2010; Turner, Hewstone,
Voci, & Vonofakou, 2008). Although reaching the contact
threshold is not a panacea for intergroup relations, it may
represent a starting point to more harmonious intergroup
relations by promoting cross-group friendships and encour-
aging subsequent intergroup contact. Reaching the contact
threshold may be associated with heightened openness to
making cross-group friends. We suggest viewing outgroup
members as potential friends as a possible defining feature
of the contact threshold. If, when reaching the threshold,
one indeed develops a cross-group friendship or friend-
ships, this is likely to be much more beneficial to intergroup
relations as a whole than reaching the threshold alone.
Conclusion
Decades of research have demonstrated that intergroup
interactions have a negative impact on intergroup bias in
the short term but a positive impact in the long term.
Although this apparent paradox has been recognized else-
where (Finchilescu, 2010; Page-Gould, 2012), we provide a
unique and timely contribution to the scientific study of
intergroup relations, presenting means by which the dis-
crepant findings from the intergroup interaction and inter-
group contact literatures can be resolved and reconciled.
Essentially, researchers of intergroup interaction and inter-
group contact studies examine the same constructs but on
different scales. Whereas researchers of intergroup interac-
tion studies typically assess one intergroup interaction,
researchers of intergroup contact studies typically assess a
person's history of intergroup interactions. Given these dif-
ferent levels of analysis, the methodological approaches of
the two literatures have varied substantially, likely account-
ing for their discrepant results. Overall, we demonstrate that
two literatures that seem to produce very different outcomes
may simply tell different parts of the same story.
To clarify the complex association between inter-
group interactions and intergroup bias then, we pro-
pose a mathematical model that will reconcile the
differences between the two literatures and generate
innovative new research avenues. Specifically, we
describe the relationship between intergroup interac-
tions and intergroup bias as an oblique asymptote, and
we use this model to identify the point at which the
curvilinear function produced by natural data aligns
with the linear relationship identified through meta-
analysis (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). We refer to this
point as the contact threshold, whereby intergroup
interactions assume the positive bias-reducing proper-
ties of intergroup contact. We propose that thinking
about the connection between intergroup interactions
and intergroup contact in terms of the contact threshold
is a useful means to integrate the seemingly paradoxical
findings of the intergroup interaction and intergroup
contact literatures. We hope that researchers will use
and amend this framework to deepen people's under-
standing of the way that social interactions affect the
health of intergroup relations in this diverse world.

Notes
1. The term intergroup contact is also used to refer to "indirect"
contact, which occurs through simple exposure to outgroup mem-
bers without direct social interactions (see Tropp & Page-Gould,
2014); however, we focus on direct contact here, as this is the type
of contact that has received the greatest empirical efforts.
2. Of course, artificial versus real-life interactions may produce
heightened anxiety and stress but may positively impact atti-
tudes, consistent with Pettigrew and Tropp's (2006) observation
that the association between intergroup contact and reduced
prejudice was stronger among those who had no choice in
engaging in intergroup contact.
