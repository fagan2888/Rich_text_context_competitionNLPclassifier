ABSTRACT
The New York State Department ofEnvironmental Conservation promulgates am-
bient water quality standards to protect sources ofpotable water from contamination
by toxic chemicals and other substances. Ambient water quality standards are a state
program with U.S. EPA oversight, including a federal Clean Water Act requirement
for "triennial review." New York's standards are derived according to procedures in
state regulation and in conjunction with the New York St.ue Department of Health.
Because standards are set at levels much below those that demonstrate effects in
laboratory studies, high-to-low dose extrapolations are required. The procedures
address both carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects. Existing regulations essen-
tially require a linear high-to-low dose extrapolation for carcinogenic effects of a
chemical (i.e., there is a finite risk at all doses above zero dose). The regulations also
require a nonlinear high-to-low dose extrapolation for the noncarcinogenic effects
(uncertainty factor approach) of the chemical (i.e., once below the threshold for the
effect, the risk at all doses above zero is zero). New York's ongoing triennial review
is addressing both standards and standard-setting procedures. Proposed revisions to
the procedures, yet to be formally adopted, would allow greater flexibility and use

INTRODUCTION
New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (.t\JYSDEC) regula-
tions require that "the discharge of sewage, industrial waste or other wastes shall
not cause impairment of the best usages of the receiving water as specified by
the water classifications at the location of discharge and at other locations that
may be affected by such discharge." The best usage (best use) of several classes
of New York State waters is as a source of drinking water. Thus, .t\JYSDEC pro-
mulgates (adopts) ambient water quality standards to protect sources of potable
water from contamination by toxic chemicals and other substances. These are re-
ferred to as Health (Water Source) standards. New York's existing standards and
standard-setting procedures can be found in New York's Codes, Rules and Regula-
tions (at 6 l\iYCRR Parts 700-706). These are available on the J\oJYSDEC web site at
http://www.dec.state.ny.us.website/regs/chIO.htm.
Ambient water quality standards are a state program with U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (USEPA) oversight. The water quality standards program provides
the basis for the goal of "Clean and Safe 'Vater" by designating the use or uses to be
made ofeach individual water body within a state (i.e., as a drinking water supply, for
recreational uses, and for the protection ofaquatic life); setting the applicable water
quality criteria that are necessary to protect these uses; and protecting existing water
quality from being lowered through antidegradation policies and implementation
procedures. The functions ofwater quality standards include establishing the water
quality goals (i.e., the designated uses); serving as the regulatory basis for estab-
lishing water-quality-based effluent limitations and total maximum daily loads; and
providing the programmatic basis for water quality management and implementa-
tion programs. Water quality standards also serve as a basis for tracking water quality
improvement or degradation.
New York State's ambient water quality standards apply to the water body itself
and are intended to protect the best use(s) of the water body, consistent with the
federal approach. Separate standards for finished drinking water (i.e., maximum
contaminant levels or MCLs) are established by the New York State Department of
Health (NYSDOH).
New York State's ambient water quality standards are derived according to pro-
cedures in New York State regulation at 6 NYCRR Part 702. These procedures are
promulgated through the State's formal mlemaking process. The procedures to
derive the Health ("Vater Source) standards are developed jointly by l\JYSDEC and
514 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.4, 2003
Water Quality Standards for Nonlinear Carcinogens
NYSDOH. These procedures are carefully designed to derive standards that are pro-
tective of the best uses of the State's waters. New York State's ambient water quality
standards predate both the USEPA and the Clean Water Act. l\'YSDEC first promul-
gated its standard-setting procedures in 1985 for surface waters and extended them
to groundwaters in 1991. Minor modification was made to the procedures in 1998.
The Clean 'Vater Act requires that states conduct a review every three years of their
water quality standards ("triennial review").
New York State is currently conducting its triennial review, in which both stan-
dards and standard-setting procedures are being addressed (see opening footnote).
Procedurally, the proposed revisions must yet undergo both l\YSDEC Executive and
Governor's Office review before being formally proposed in rulemaking. The for-
mal rulemaking process involves public hearing, public comment, and review by the
State Environmental Board before a notice of adoption can be issued. Following
adoption, the regulations must be submitted to the rSEPA along with certification
by the New York State Attorney General. Once the USEPA approves the submitted
package, it will be in effect for Clean 'Vater Act purposes.
EXISTING STANDARD-SETIING PROCEDURES
Ambient water quality standards are based on comprehensive review of the toxi-
city information on a chemical, including, in most cases. primarv sources. New York
State has always evaluated the potential of a substance to cause both cancer and
noncancer effects. Thus, New York State's existing standard-setting procedures al-
low the derivation (if appropriate) ofvalues for both oncogenic (carcinogenic) and
nononcogenic effects of a substance. Because standards are set at levels much be-
low those that demonstrate effects in human populations or in laboratory studies of
experimental animals, high-to-low dose extrapolations are required. Existing regula-
tions essen tially require a linear high-to-low dose extrapolation for oncogenic effects
ofa chemical (i.e., there is a finite risk at all doses above zero dose). The lifetime ex-
cess cancer risk level prescribed in New York State's regulations is a risk management
decision and is set at one in one million. Tile regulations also require a nonlinear
high-to-low dose extrapolation for the nononcogenic ellccts (uncertainty factor ap-
proach) of the chemical (i.e., once below the threshold for the effect, the risk at all
doses above zero is zero). The most stringent (numr-ricallv It H\l'r) of the oncogenic,
nononcogenic, and the I\TSDOH drinking water standard Ole},) is promulgated
as the standard.
One of the strengths ofNew York State's water qualitv standards program has been
NYSDEC's actions over the years to revise its standards, to he either more stringent or
less stringent, as new toxicity data dictates. Such a rigorous, science-based standards
program leads to greater public understanding and acceptance of revisions in either
direction of stringency. To maintain the strongest scientific basis for the program,
NYSDEC must now revise not only its standards bur also the procedures by which
future standards are derived.

New York State's procedures to derive standards based on oncogenic effects have
been changed little since 1985; however, recent years have seen significant advances
in understanding the modes of actions of carcinogens and in procedures to derive
values protective ofhuman health. Revisions contained in the proposal reflect the lat-
est scientific knowledge and are consistent with USEPA's Methodology for Deriving
Ambient Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Human Health (USEPA, 2000)
and with USEPA's latest revision to their Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment
(USEPA, 2003).
In 1985, and in 1986 (when the USEPAissued its first setofcancer risk guidelines) ,
it was believed that any level ofexposure to any carcinogenic substance carried some
level of risk, and that the level of risk was dependent on the amount of exposure.
In other words, all carcinogenic effects are linear at low doses (see Appendix). Thus,
the initial 1985l\'YSDEC standard-setting procedures, which centered on the health-
protective linearized multistage model for extrapolating the carcinogenic effects of
chemicals from high to low doses, were consistent with the scientific consensus of the
time. Since then, the accumulating scientific evidence has convinced many scientists
that some carcinogens act via a nonlinear mode of action (see Appendix). In other
words, some chemicals may cause cancer by a mode of action that is nonlinear at
lowdoses (see Appendix). The proposed revisions to the standard-setting procedures
allow the use of the uncertainty factor approach for extrapolating the carcinogenic
effects of such chemicals from high to low doses. However, such an analysis would be
permitted only if the weight ofevidence was overwhelming in support ofa nonlinear
mode of action (see step 5, following).
PROPOSED REVISIONS TO PROCEDURES FOR DERIVING AMBIENT
WATER QUAUlY STANDARDS BASED ON ONCOGENIC
(CARCINOGENIC) EFFECTS
This is a six-step process.
Step 1. Determination of Oncogenicity
First, a determination must be made whether the substance causes an oncogenic
effect (see Appendix) as defined in New York State regulations. This definition is
unchanged from the existing regulations.
Step 2. Selection of Dose-Response Data
If a substance meets this definition, the dose-response data deemed most appro-
priate for evaluating potential human health risks at environmental exposures shall
be selected. Human data of high quality and adequate statistical power are gener-
ally preferred over animal data as the basis of a water quality value. For almost all
of existing New York State standards, the human data were judged inadequate and
animal data were used to derive the oncogenic value. Factors for data selection in-
clude route, duration and timing of exposure, species, strain, tumor types and sites,

nature and severity of effects, pharmacokinetics, mode of action, study quality, and
statistical significance.
Step 3. Determination of Point of Departure
The starting point for the oncogenic value calculation is the point of departure
(POD; see Appendix) for the selected dose-response data, which, depending on the
quality of the data, could represent more than one animal species, cancer site, or
experiment. The POD is generally the LEDIO, which is the 95% lower confidence
limit on the dose (mg/kg/day) associated with 10% excess risk for oncogenic effects
adjusted for background risk.
The POD is derived using the following hierarchy. The first choice is to use a
validated biologicall)' based dose-response model (BBDRM; see Appendix). Absent such
model, the second choice is to use a mathematical model (multistage, probit, lo-
gistic, or Weibull) that best describes the dose-response data within the range of
observation. The third option would be to use an alternative POD such as a no-
observed-effect level (NOEL) or a lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL).
Step 4. Conversion to Human Dose
If the POD is derived from animal data, the human equivalent dose at the POD is
then estimated by multiplying the animal-to-human body-weight ratio raised to the
0.25 power by the animal dose, or by using an alternative trans-species conversion
method if deemed more appropriate.
Step 5. Extrapolation to Low Dose
The next major step is to extrapolate to low dose (dose at the level of the ambient
standard) from the POD. This is done one of several ways. If the POD was estimated
from a validated BBDRM (the first choice in step 3), the ambient standard is derived
based on the 95% lower confidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an
excess lifetime cancer risk of one in one million.
If a validated BBDRi\1. is not available, a mode-of-action analysis is conducted. The
results ofthis analysis will determine whether the extrapolation from the human dose
at the POD to a low dose is via linear or nonlinear approach.
The default approach is linear. If there are no data on mode of action, or if
the mode-of-action analysis provides either evidr-nce of linearity at low doses or a
lack of unequivocal evidence of nonlinearitv at low dose-s. a linear extrapolation will
be performed. Specifically, the ambient standard will he based on the 95% lower
confidence limit on the human dose corresponding to an excess lifetime cancer risk
of one in one million. To calculate this, the human equivale-nt dose at the POD is
multiplied by a factor equal to the risk level of one in one million divided by the risk
level at the POD.
However, if the mode-of-action analvsis provides hath no evidence for linear-
ity at low doses and unequivocal evidence of nonlinearity at low doses, a nonlinear
(uncertainty factor) approach is used to estimate the dose at the level of the ambient

standard. The human equivalent dose at the POD will be divided by an uncertainty
factor ofsuch magnitude to ensure that the human dose at the standard will be "with-
out appreciable risk to the human population, including children." The factor will
generally range from 10 to 3,000. Factors considered in determining its magnitude
will include the nature of the dose-response curve and the point of departure; the
relative sensitivities of experimental animals and humans; the nature and extent of
human variation, including age-specific differences in sensitivity during a lifetime;
and data gaps in the toxicological database.
Step 6. Calculation of Standard
An ambient water quality standard based on oncogenic effects is then calculated
from the outcome of step 5. If the human dose at the level of the standard was
determined from a BBDRM or a linear approach, that human dose is multiplied by
a body weight of 70 kg and divided by a water consumption rate of 2 1 per day to
yield the standard, (Alternative body weight and water consumption rates can be
used where warranted.)
If the human dose at the level of the standard was determined using a nonlinear
approach, that human dose is multiplied by a body weight of 70 kg and a relative
source contribution of no more than 20%, and divided by a water consumption rate
of21 per day to yield the standard. (Alternative body weight and water consumption
rates can be used where warranted.)
SUMMARY
The proposed revisions to NewYork State's procedures for deriving ambient water
quality standards will provide needed flexibility to address carcinogenic substances
that work via a nonlinear mode of action. These revisions will provide this flexibility
while retaining a health-protective approach.
This proposed change is a movement toward harmonization of risk assessment
methods for evaluating the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic effects of chemicals.
The addition of a procedure for deriving a standard based on carcinogenic effects
that are nonlinear at low doses allows New York State to derive a cancer-based stan-
dard using the same approach used to derive a standard based on the noncancer
effects ofa chemical (i.e., identification ofNOEL, LOEL, or benchmark, and applica-
tion of one or more uncertainty factor to compensate for uncertainty and variation).
However, the uncertainty factor approach is not the default procedure for cancer
effects, as it is for noncancer effects. Moreover, the proposed revisions to the regu-
lations require a substantial amount of data and little or no uncertainty regarding
the mode of action before the nonlinear, uncertainty-factor-based approach can be
used to derive a standard based on cancer effects.
Inherent in both the linear and nonlinear approach is the assumption that the
dose-response for carcinogenic effects is monotonic. In other words, the critical
effects decrease as dose decreases across all doses above zero (linear) or decrease
as doses decreases across all doses above the threshold (nonlinear). 1\iYSDEC and

NYSDOH staff are not at this time planning on further harmonization of the two
approaches using recommendations suggested by Calabrese and Baldwin (2003),
which incorporate hormesis into risk assessment. However, staff will continue to
monitor the developments in the field of honnesis so as to fully understand the
implications hormesis mayor will have in regulatory risk assessment.

BiologicallJ baseddose-response modelmeans a model that describes and quantifies the
key events in the molecular, cellular, tissue, or organismal responses to a chem-
ical or other toxic pollutant across a range of doses. Model parameters should
represent biological phenomena rather than arbitrary statistically derived values
such as polynomial regression coefficients. Such models, when they accurately
describe the relationship between dose and response within the range of experi-
mental observation, may provide biological justification [or predicted responses
at doses below the range of observation,
Key event means measurable and necessary steps in a mode of action or measurable
indicators of such steps.
Linear at 1010 doses means the frequency or severity of a molecular, cellular, tissue, or
organismal response (i.e., key event) to a chemical or other toxic pollutant varies
proportionally with dose at human doses at or near the standard or guidance
value for that chemical or toxic pollutant.
Mode of action means a sequence of key events that provides a biologically plausible
explanation for how a chemical or other toxic polhuanr interacts with a biological
target in humans or experimental animals to cause a ~iven effect,
Nonlinear at 101/1 doses means the frequenrv or scvcrirv of a molecular, cellular, tissue,
or organismal response (i.e., key event) to a chr-mical or other toxic pollutant
does not vary proportionally with dose at human doses at or near the standard or
guidance value for that chemical or toxic pollutant.
Oncogenic effectmeans the induction of tumors that has been demonstrated in: (i) hu-
mans; (ii) two mammalian species; (iii) one mammalian species, independently
reproduced; (iv) one mammalian species, to an unusual degree with respect to

results for another substance for which similar oncogenic effects are anticipated
because of similarity of functional groups or metabolic or toxicologic pathways.
Point of departure means a point on a dose-response curve for an effect of a chemi-
calor other toxic pollutant that is within or near the range of experimental or
observational data for the effect. It shall be the lower 95% confidence limit on a
dose for an estimated level of excess risk for an effect, or it can be a no-observed-
effect level (NOEL) or lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) for an effect. It is the
starting point for the extrapolation from the range of observation in human or
animal studies to the human doses at or near the standard or guidance value for
that chemical or toxic pollutant.
