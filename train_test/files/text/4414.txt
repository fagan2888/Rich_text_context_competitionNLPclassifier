ABSTRACT
Neurons born in the postnatal SVZ (subventricular zone)
must migrate a great distance before becoming mature
interneurons of the OB (olfactory bulb). During migration
immature OB neurons maintain an immature morphology
until they reach their destination. While the morphological
development of these cells must be tightly regulated, the
cellular pathways responsible are still largely unknown. Our
results show that the non-canonical Wnt pathway induced
by Wnt5a is important for the morphological development
of OB interneurons both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally,
we demonstrate that non-canonical Wnt signalling works
in opposition to canonical Wnt signalling in neural pre-
cursors from the SVZ in vitro. This represents a novel role
for Wnt5a in the development of OB interneurons and
suggests that canonical and non-canonical Wnt pathways
dynamically oppose each other in the regulation of
dendrite maturation.

INTRODUCTION
The SVZ (subventricular zone) surrounding the lateral
ventricles is one of the two neurogenic niches in the
postnatal mouse brain, the other being the subgranular zone
of the dentate gyrus. Neurons born in the SVZ migrate along
the RMS (rostral migratory stream) to become OB (olfactory
bulb) interneurons. While migrating, immature interneurons
maintain a simplified morphology with a single leading
process as they migrate in chains (Lois et al., 1996). OB
interneurons do not attain full morphological maturity until
they reach their appropriate destination within the OB. This
entire process from specification to functional integration
takes 5­9 days in the adult mouse (Petreanu and Alvarez-
Buylla, 2002). As OB interneuron specification and complete
morphological maturity are separated substantially in both
space and time, this is an ideal system for studying the
morphological development of neurons in the postnatal
brain.
Wnt signalling is integral to both neuronal specification
and development. In the postnatal brain, Wnts are important
in stem cell proliferation (Adachi et al., 2007) and have been
shown to be involved in both differentiation (Lie et al., 2005)
and neurite development of hippocampal granule cells (Rosso
et al., 2005; Yu and Malenka, 2003). However, it is unclear as
to what roles specific Wnt signalling pathways play in these
cells. Increased dendritic complexity was shown to be
dependent on b-catenin; however, this effect did not require
LEF (lymphoid enhancer factor)/TCF (T-cell factor)-mediated
transcriptional activation (Yu and Malenka, 2003). Moreover,
Yu and Malenka demonstrate that activated LEF-1 has the
opposite effect of activated b-catenin, and suppressed
neurite outgrowth in hippocampal cultures. It is therefore
likely that b-catenin influences dendritic growth through its
role in modulating cell adhesion and the actin cytoskeleton,
independent of Wnt signalling (Yu and Malenka, 2003;
Gavard and Mege, 2005).
Wnt7b has been shown to increase the complexity of
hippocampal neurons in culture via the non-canonical JNK
(c-Jun N-terminal kinase) Wnt pathway (Rosso et al., 2005).
The addition of Wnt inhibitor sFRP-1 (secreted frizzled-
related protein 1) to these cultures not only blocked the
effect but also simplified the morphology of the neurons
beyond that of control cultures, indicating an endogenous
role for the non-canonical Wnt pathway in the morphological

development of hippocampal cells. The JNK pathway was also
shown to increase neurite outgrowth in ESFT (Ewing sarcoma
family tumour) cells, which can be stimulated by Wnt3a or
canonical inhibitor DKK-1 (Dickkopf-related protein 1) (Endo
et al., 2008). However, sFRP-1 has also been shown to
increase dendritic outgrowth in a non-Wnt-dependent
manner in retinal ganglion cells (Rodriguez et al., 2005).
Recently, Wnt5a signalling via the Wnt/Ca+ pathway was
shown to stimulate dendritic spine morphogenesis in
hippocampal neurons (Varela-Nallar et al., 2010). These
findings suggest that specific Wnt molecules may play
different roles depending on cellular context. It is still
unknown as to whether Wnts play a role in the morphological
development of SVZ-derived OB interneurons; although it
does appear that the Wnt/b-catenin pathway is important for
the proliferation of progenitor cells in the SVZ (Adachi et al.,
2007). Interestingly, traditionally non-canonical Wnt ligands
Wnt5a and Wnt7b, but not canonical Wnts, are expressed by
OB interneurons themselves (Shimogori et al., 2004).
Using soluble Wnt ligands Wnt5a and Wnt3a, and inhibitors
DKK-1 and sFRP-1 on SVZ progenitor cell cultures, we show
that non-canonical Wnt signalling is necessary for normal
morphological maturation of OB interneurons. In our culture
system the activation of the non-canonical Wnt pathway acts
in opposition to canonical Wnt/b-catenin signalling. Moreover,
evidence from the Wnt5a knockout mouse indicates that
normal morphological development of OB interneurons is
disrupted in the absence of endogenous Wnt5a.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
All animal protocols were approved by the UCSF IACUC. P5
CD1s (Charles River) were used for cultures. Wnt5a knockout
mice (Yamaguchi et al., 1999) were backcrossed more than 7
generations with C57BL/6. Pregnant mice were killed at E18.5
(embryonic day 18.5) via cervical dislocation after being
anaesthetized with isofluorane. Mutants were identified
visually using the very distinctive Wnt5a phenotype. Males
and females were used for all experiments.
In situ hybridization
P1 brain tissues were collected after intracardiac perfusion
with 4% (w/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) and post-fixed with
4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Fixed tissues were cryoprotected in
20% sucrose before embedding in OCT (optimal cutting
temperature) compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrance, CA,
U.S.A.). Tissues were cut on a cryostat at 20 mm and directly
mounted on to Colorfrost slides (Fisher Scientific, Houston, TX,
U.S.A.). The slides were stored at 280°C before use. For in situ
hybridization, slides were warmed to room temperature and
treated with proteinase K (50 mg/ml) for 2 min, and fixed with
4% PFA for 10 min. Acetylation was performed using 0.25%
acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 10 min,
followed by three PBS washes. Slides were incubated with
hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 56SSC, 0.3 mg/ml
yeast tRNA, 100 mg/ml heparin, 16Denhart's, 0.1% Tween 20,
0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM EDTA) for 10 min at 65°C, followed by
overnight incubation with a digoxigenin-labelled probe (300
ng/ml). Five high-stringency washes were performed with
0.26SSC at 65°C. Slides were then incubated with horseradish
AP (alkaline phosphatase)-conjugated anti-digoxigenin and
NBT (nitroblue tetrazolium)/BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-indolyl
phosphate) (Roche) for signal detection. The non-radioactive
probes were made from EST (expressed sequence tag) clones
for Wnt2b and Wnt5a, which were purchased from Open
Biosystems, and the Wnt3a cDNA plasmid was a gift from Roel
Nusse (Roelink and Nusse, 1991).
Immunohistochemistry
Brains were processed using standard methods. Cells and
tissue sections were stained using standard protocols with:
mouse anti-Tuj1 (Covance, 1:3000 for cells), rabbit anti-MAP2
(Chemicon, 1:500 for cells), rabbit anti-Pax6 (Covance, 1:150
for tissue), rabbit anti-CB (Swant, 1:1500 for tissue), rabbit
anti-TH (tyrosine hydroxylase) (Chemicon, 1:400 for tissue)
and rabbit anti-VGAT (vasicular c-aminobutyric acid trans-
porter) (Synaptic Systems, 1:200 for cells). Fluorescent
secondary antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) and DAPI (49,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole) (1:1000, Sigma) were used.
Cell Culture
NPCs (neural progenitor cells) were harvested from lateral
ventricle SVZ tissue of P5 CD1s. Tissue was dissociated with
0.1% Trypsin (Worthington) and 0.1% DNAse1 (Roche).
DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium)/F12 (50:50;
Gibco) was supplemented with 106hormone mix (40 mg
transferrin, 10 mg insulin, 3.86 mg putrescine, 4.0 ml 3 mM
selenium, 4.0 ml 2 mM progesterone, 10 ml 2 mg/ml Heparin
[all from Sigma]), 0.8 ml 30% glucose, 0.6 ml 7.5% NaHCO3
,
10 ml 30% glucose, 7.5 ml 7.5% NaHCO3
, 2.5 ml 1 M Hepes, 5
ml 200 mM glutamine, 5 ml Pencillin­Streptomycin and 2 ml
Fungizone). Medium containing EGF (epidermal growth
factor; Sigma, 10 ng/ml), bFGF (basic fibroblast growth
factor; Sigma, 20 ng/ml) and B27 (Invitrogen) was added.
Cells were plated at 80000 cells per 25 cm2 flask (Corning),
grown in 5 ml of complete medium plus growth factors and
B27. Passage 2 or 3 NPCs were used.
Cell culture-Wnt treatments
NPCs were dissociated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, washed with
PBS, pelleted and resuspended in complete medium with 2%
FBS (fetal bovine serum) (Hyclone). The cells were plated on
poly-L-lysine 0.01% (Sigma, MW
70000­150000 kDa) and

laminin-coated (1 mg/ml, Invitrogen) chamber slides (Nunc)
at 37500 cells/well. Plated cells were left to differentiate for
24 h (Figure 1) or 96 h (Figure 2) before treatment with Wnt
factors. At the appropriate time mouse Wnt5a (0.375 ng/ml
final working concentration), Wnt3a (0.15 ng/ml final working
concentration), sFRP-1 (5.0 ng/ml final working concen-
tration), DKK-1 (0.06 ng/ml final working concentration) (all
from R&D Systems) or an equivalent volume of vehicle were
added to each well. One-half of the treated medium was
replaced each day. The cultures were analysed after 4 days of
treatment.
Image analysis and quantification
Three biological replicates of each experiment were per-
formed. For in vitro experiments, cells from 3 to 5 620
magnification images were quantified for each replicate of
each culture condition, including at least 100 cells from each
condition. Cells were excluded from the analysis if all dendrite
tips could not be clearly visualized.
One mutant and one littermate control animal were
analysed from three separate litters. Cell counts from
standardized counting boxes in three coronal sections of
each brain were averaged for both the Pax6 and CB staining.
DAPI counterstains were used to confirm the presence of cell
bodies. PGL width was measured in four places for each TH
and VGAT stained section and averaged. These values for each
animal were then pooled and compared across genotypes.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as means¡S.E.M. Results were analysed
using two-tailed Student's t test with unequal variance. Any
value of P#0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS
Wnt5a and non-canonical Wnt signalling
increase neurite complexity
To study the role of Wnt ligands in regulating the neuronal
differentiation of SVZ-derived OB interneurons, we took
advantage of the ease of generating these cells in vitro via
differentiation from neural precursors. We cultured neural
precursor cells from the SVZ of P5 mice, then placed them in
serum-containing medium for 24 h to induce differentiation.
We then treated the cultures with soluble Wnt ligands and
inhibitors for 4 days, and then analysed the neuritic complexity
of the resulting neurons. This experiment is designed to
examine the effects of Wnt ligands on differentiation rather
than neuronal specification since the ligands were not added
until well after the global differentiation stimulus of serum
was added to the cells. The largely non-canonical Wnt ligand,
Wnt5a, and the largely canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt3a, had
markedly different effects on neurite development in these

cells (Figures 1A­1C). Wnt5a treatment led to increased
neurite growth, whereas Wnt3a inhibited neurite outgrowth.
We used a simple measure of neurite complexity, TDBTN (total
dendritic branch tip number) (Rosso et al., 2005), to assess
these findings in a quantitative way. We found that TDBTN was
significantly higher in cultures treated with Wnt5a compared
with controls, and cultures treated with Wnt3a significantly
decreased TDBTN compared with control cultures treated with
vehicle only (Figure 1F).
Our results imply that Wnt5a leads to distinct effects on
neuritic maturation in these cultures compared with Wnt3a,
possibly due to differences in Wnt signalling pathway
activation (Wnt/b-catenin signalling versus non-canonical
signalling). To tease apart the differences in these effects, we
treated the cultures with different families of extracellular Wnt
inhibitors to determine the pathway specificity. When sFRP-1
was applied to cultures, an inhibitor that blocks both canoni-
cal and non-canonical Wnt signalling by sequestering Wnt
ligands and so they cannot bind their cognate Frizzled receptors
(Rattner et al., 1997), the neurite complexity was decreased
(Figure 1D) and TDBTN was significantly lower than in control
cultures (Figure 1F). In contrast, cultures treated with DKK-1,
an inhibitor that specifically blocks canonical Wnt signalling
by interfering with LRP5/6 [LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-
receptor-related protein 5/6] co-receptors (Mao et al., 2001),
showed an increase in neurite complexity (Figure 1E) reflected
by a significant increase in TDBTN (Figure 1E). Our results
imply that canonical and non-canonical Wnt signalling have
markedly different effects on the morphological maturation of
neurons derived from the mouse SVZ. In addition, the effects
of inhibitors on cultures without the addition of exogenous
Wnts indicate that under normal culture conditions Wnt
signalling is probably a potent regulator of neurite outgrowth,
both positively and negatively.
Wnt signalling plays a sustained role in neurite
differentiation in culture
Wnt signalling appears to be a significant regulator of neurite
development in neural precursor cells during the first few
days in culture. However, given the profound roles of
canonical Wnt signalling in neural precursor proliferation
and cell fate acquisition, we wanted to determine whether
Wnt signalling plays an ongoing role in the growth of
neurites or whether the Wnts predominantly act at the stage
of initial neurite outgrowth, perhaps by influencing the cell
fate acquisition process itself or initial stages of neurite
polarization. In addition, if Wnt signalling plays a role in
neurite maturation when the interneurons reach the OB, then
the effects of Wnts should be ongoing even after several
days.
To address this, we used neurons differentiated from SVZ
cultures that were allowed to grow in serum without
additives for 72 h. We then treated the cells with Wnts and
Wnt inhibitors starting at this later time point. It was
apparent that neurites continued to extend during this
growth period in control cultures (Figures 2A and 2B) and
this was reflected in the TDBTN (Figure 2G). Like at the earlier
stage of neurite outgrowth, we found that Wnt5a increased
the complexity of neurite outgrowth significantly over what
we observed in controls and Wnt3a inhibited the complexity

compared with control situations (Figures 2C, 2D and 2G).
The normal increase in neurite complexity was also blocked by
sFRP-1 (Figures 2E and 2G) and significantly increased when
the selective canonical Wnt inhibitor DKK-1 was added to
cultures (Figures 2F and 2G).
Again the significant effects seen with the inhibitors,
particularly the DKK-1 blockade of endogenous canonical Wnt
ligand signalling, indicate that this pathway is an ongoing
regulator of neurite maturation in these cultures. The
retardation of outgrowth in the sFRP-1 condition compared
with the acceleration in the DKK-1 condition suggests an
ongoing balance of endogenous non-canonical and canonical
Wnt signalling that acts to regulate the rate and extent of
neurite growth and complexity throughout the culture period.
Cellular organization of the OB is intact in
Wnt5a mutant mice
Since there are many Wnt ligands in the genome and there is
extensive redundancy, examples of clear loss-of-function
phenotypes for Wnt ligands are not that common. However,
we wanted to determine whether there is a role for Wnt5a in
regulating olfactory interneuron neurite development in vivo.
Previous reports showed that Wnt5a is expressed in the early
postnatal mouse OB periglomerular (PGC) and granule (GC)
cells (Shimogori et al., 2004). First though we examined the
distribution of canonical Wnt signalling during the early
postnatal phase. Interestingly we found using the Bat-gal
mice (Maretto et al., 2003) that P1 mice have ongoing
signalling in the SVZ but little evidence of this in the RMS or
within the OB (Figure 3A). This may be indicative of our
model that non-canonical Wnt ligands may have a more
prominent effect on the OB interneurons as they arrive in the
OB and begin to mature. Indeed, we found that Wnt5a is
expressed in GCs, PGCs, and at the base of the RMS at both
P1 and P5 (Figures 3B and 3E). Therefore, as immature
interneurons reach the OB after migrating through the RMS,
they begin to express Wnt5a and also encounter already-
established neurons expressing Wnt5a as they seek to
integrate themselves into the local network. To determine
the expression of potentially relevant canonical Wnt ligands,
we examined the expression of Wnt3a, Wnt2b and Wnt1, all
previously examined by others in these structures as well
(Shimogori et al., 2004). We found both Wnt3a and Wnt2b
to be expressed at high levels primarily in the fimbrial
neuroepithelium at P1 (Figures 3C and 3D) and were unable
to see convincing evidence for Wnt1 expression at this age
(results not shown). Given the recent evidence that there is
extensive exposure of the ventricular zone and SVZ to ligands
secreted into the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid; Lehtinen et al.,

2011), and our finding that canonical Wnt signalling is
abundant in the SVZ (Figure 3A), it seems likely that the
fimbrial neuroepithelium may be a relevant physiological
source of Wnt ligands in the CSF.
We turned to the previously characterized Wnt5a null
mutant mice (Yamaguchi et al., 1999) to determine whether
Wnt5a plays a role in OB development. These mice do not
survive past birth, and so we confined our analysis to late
embryonic stages (E18.5). Since the role of Wnt5a in olfactory
interneurons has not been previously examined, we first
looked for defects in cell number and organization of PGCs
and GCs in the OB of Wnt5a knockout mice. A nuclear DAPI
stain of Wnt5a2/2 OB shows no obvious difference from
littermate control animals (Figures 4A and 4B). To examine
specific populations of OB interneurons, we turned to
antibodies that are specific for subpopulations of PGCs and
GCs. Pax6 is a nuclear marker that labels a subset of both GCs
and PGCs in the OB (Kohwi et al., 2005) and allows for a
straightforward and sensitive measure of the cell density of
these groups of neurons. There was no obvious difference
between Wnt5a2/2 mice and littermate controls in the PGC
layer (Figures 4C and 4D). CB (calbindin) is another useful
marker expressed in the cytoplasm of subsets of OB
interneurons (Kohwi et al., 2007), and we found no clear
difference in the numbers of CB+ cells in the OB of mutants
and control mice (Figures 4E and 4F). To quantify the

numbers of Pax6+ and CB+ interneurons in these mice, we
counted them in standardized counting boxes. For Pax6, we
restricted our cell counts to PGCs because of the substantial
number of neural progenitor cells that express Pax6 deep in
the core of the OB near GCs. This analysis revealed no
difference in the number of these cells between mutant and
control mice (Figure 4G). We also examined CB+ PGCs and
GCs and found no difference between mutants and controls
(Figures 4H and 4I).
Wnt5a mutant mice have reduced OB
interneuron neuropil
The results of our Pax6 and CB analyses indicate that overall
organization and cell number of several groups of OB
interneurons are preserved in the OB of Wnt5a2/2 mice,
but we wondered whether their morphology might be altered.
We wanted to examine structural differences in the OB of
Wnt5a2/2 mice directly using more sensitive markers of neu-
ropil morphology. TH is expressed in a subset of PGCs (Kohwi
et al., 2007), staining both their cell bodies and dendrites, and
gives a useful view of PGC morphology. Control mice had
strong staining for TH in the PGC layer. This marker highlights
the cell bodies of these cells and also stains a reticular network
of processes that are distributed throughout the PGC layer
forming a meshwork of dendritic processes around the
glomeruli (Figure 5A). In Wnt5a2/2 mice, the number of
PGCs appeared unchanged (similar to our findings with Pax6
and CB), but the density of neuropil staining was dramatically
decreased and the reticular network of dendrites was
substantially less dense (Figure 5B). These differences were
even more apparent in high-power images of the PGCs
(Figures 5A' and 5B'). To quantify this difference, we measured
the width of the TH+ neuropil in multiple places in the PGC
layer to establish a measure of PGC layer neurite complexity
and found that it was significantly reduced compared with
littermate controls (Figure 5C).
Since periglomerular interneurons are GABAergic, we also
stained for the VGAT to further examine the neuropil in the
PGC layer in these mutants. This showed that VGAT staining
was markedly decreased in Wnt5a2/2 mice (Figure 5E). At
high power, much of the VGAT staining was punctate in
appearance, presumably reflecting its localization to pre-
synaptic GABAergic terminals, and the density of these

puncta was apparently decreased in mutants (Figures 5D' and
5E'). In addition, as with TH, the thickness of the PGC layer
was much reduced in mutants (Figure 5F).
DISCUSSION
Our results show that the morphological development of OB
interneurons derived from the SVZ is dependent on Wnt5a,
which likely acts via non-canonical Wnt signalling to increase
neurite complexity. Blockade of Wnt signalling in SVZ-derived
neural precursor cells in vitro using the non-specific Wnt
inhibitor sFRP-1 resulted in a simplified neuronal morpho-
logy, indicating a role for endogenous Wnts in morphological
development. In mice lacking Wnt5a, interneuron morpho-
logy is disrupted in the OB, while cell number and OB
architecture remain intact. Our findings are reminiscent of
those in rat hippocampal cells where sFRP-1 blocks neurite
outgrowth and non-canonical Wnt ligand Wnt7b increases
dendritic complexity (Rosso et al., 2005; Endo et al., 2008).
Moreover our results support previous reports that Wnt/b-
catenin signalling inhibits neurite outgrowth (Ouchi et al.,
2005; Votin et al., 2005; Endo et al., 2008); although b-
catenin seems to have the opposite effect when acting
outside the Wnt pathway (Yu and Malenka, 2003). This
implies that Wnt signalling may be important in regulating
dendrite maturation elsewhere in the nervous system,
although the role of specific Wnt molecules may vary in
different systems.
Wnt5a is able to act as either a canonical or non-canonical
Wnt ligand depending on receptor context (Mikels and Nusse,
2006), and previous studies have been ambiguous about
which Wnt pathways are important for morphological
development in postnatal neurogenesis (Yu and Malenka,
2003; Rosso et al., 2005; Endo et al., 2008; Varela-Nallar et al.,
2010). In our cell culture experiments, DKK-1, a canonical
Wnt inhibitor acts to increase neurite complexity, and the
largely canonical Wnt ligand Wnt3a slows down the rate of
morphological development. These findings suggest that
Wnt5a acts on the non-canonical pathway in this system. It
also indicates that canonical Wnt signalling directly sup-
presses dendrite maturation and acts in opposition to non-
canonical signalling in SVZ-derived neurons.
Morphogenesis is a dynamic process in neural precursors
from the SVZ, with migrating and dividing cells of the RMS
continually protruding and retracting processes throughout
the cell cycle (Coskun and Luskin, 2002). During migration,
dividing cells predictably retract their processes immediately
before cytokinesis (Coskun et al., 2007), indicating that cell
cycle factors also impact morphogenesis. More specifically, a
gradient of BMPs (bone morphogenic proteins) in the RMS
has been shown to influence when SVZ-derived immature
neurons become postmitotic (Coskun and Luskin, 2002), and
may have some additional influence on neurite development
in vivo. The presence of BMP or other factors in the RMS may
therefore contribute additional regulation to neurite out-
growth, providing a bridge for controlling morphogenesis
while immature neurons migrate from the SVZ to the OB.
Once in the OB, PGCs form synapses around the glomeruli
where they come into contact with OSNs (olfactory sensory
axons) and mitral cells. OSNs have been previously shown to
express Wnt5a, and their axons are responsive to Wnt5a in
vitro (Rodriguez-Gil and Greer, 2008). Additionally, exogenous
application of Wnt5a on to OSNs in culture resulted in
increased growth cone branching compared with control
cultures (Rodriguez-Gil and Greer, 2008). These findings
indicate that Wnt5a in the OB may affect multiple cell
populations, including innervation of the glomeruli by OSN. It
is therefore possible that the thinning of the glomerular layer
we observed may reflect decreased innervation by the OSNs,
and further studies should be conducted to test this possibility.
Previous studies have highlighted the role of canonical
Wnt signalling in the regulation of neural precursor
proliferation and neural cell fate (Yu and Malenka, 2003;
Adachi et al., 2007). Our findings suggest that canonical Wnt
signalling may have an additional role in maintaining already
differentiated OB interneurons in a simplified morphology
even after cell fate has been determined. In our model, neural
precursor cells are exposed to canonical Wnt signalling in the
SVZ, which along with other factors including BMPs help
maintain cells in a simplified morphology. Once the migratory
neurons reach the anterior RMS and OB and contact mature
interneurons in the periglomerular layer and granule layer,
they are exposed to Wnt5a via paracrine signalling and
complete their morphologic differentiation. This model
implicates a novel interaction between canonical and non-
canonical Wnt signalling pathways in the regulation of
neuronal morphology in OB interneurons that may be
important elsewhere in the nervous system.
