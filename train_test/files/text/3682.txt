Abstract
Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of protocadherin 17 (PCDH17) promoter
methylation in bladder cancer.
Methods: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction was used to examine the promoter
methylation status of PCDH17 in tumour tissue specimens obtained from patients with bladder
cancer, and in normal bladder epithelial tissue specimens obtained from age- and sex-matched
controls. The correlations between methylation status and demographic and clinicopathological
parameters, and disease outcome, were assessed.
Results: Methylation of the PCDH17 promoter was detected in 77/115 (67.0%) patients with
bladder cancer and 0/43 (0%) of the controls. Methylation was significantly associated with high
cancer grade (G3), advanced cancer stage (T2­T4), large tumour diameter (> 3 cm) and tumour
recurrence. Methylation was also associated with significantly shorter survival time compared with
unmethylated PCDH17 in patients with bladder cancer, and was an independent predictor of overall
survival.
Conclusions: PCDH17 promoter methylation is closely associated with bladder cancer
malignancy and may be used as an independent predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with
bladder cancer.

Introduction
Bladder cancer is one of the most common
genitourinary cancers worldwide and is a
significant cause of cancer-related mortality,
with an estimated 72 570 new cases and
15 210 cancer-associated deaths expected in
the USA in 2013.1 The burden of bladder
cancer-related morbidity is expected to
increase due to changes in exposure to risk
factors for bladder cancer development, and
to the growth and increasing age of the
global population.2,3 The initiation and
progression of bladder cancer is character-
ized by the gradual accumulation of multiple
genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to
activation of proto-oncogenes or inactiva-
tion of tumour suppressor genes.4,5
Epigenetic alterations in bladder cancer
include DNA methylation, histone modifi-
cation and RNA interference.6 Epigenetic
modifications, particularly DNA methyla-
tion, play an important role in the progres-
sion of bladder cancer, since DNA
methylation often results in the hypermethy-
lation of selected gene promoters and the
inactivation of tumour suppressor genes.7,8
Identification of novel methylated tumour
suppressor genes may be used in the diag-
nosis, prognosis and therapy of bladder
cancer.
Protocadherins (PCDHs) belong to a
subfamily of the cadherin superfamily of
calcium-dependent intercellular adhesion
molecules that play a key role in cell adhe-
sion and are also involved in the inhibition
of tumour cell growth, migration and inva-
sion.9,10 Several PCDH genes, including
PCDH8, PCDH10 and PCDH20, are fre-
quently silenced in human neoplasms,9­12
suggesting that they function as tumour
suppressor genes. Since PCDH17 is in the
same non-clustered subgroup, the present
study focused on this gene as a candidate
tumour suppressor.11,12 The PCDH17 pro-
moter is a TATA-less promoter containing
CG-rich sequences that may be susceptible
to DNA methylation. PCDH17 methylation
is found in several human carcinomas
including urological cancers.7,12,13
In the present study, the promoter methy-
lation status of PCDH17 in bladder cancer
tissue was examined and compared with
normal tissues. In addition, the correlation
between PCDH17 promoter methylation
status and clinicopathological parameters
was examined, together with patient out-
come, in order to elucidate the clinical
significance of PCDH17 promoter methyla-
tion in patients with bladder cancer.
Patients and methods
Study population and tissue specimens
This case­control study included tumour
samples from patients who had been diag-
nosed with bladder cancer between March
2004 and March 2008 at the Third Hospital
of Hebei Medical University, Shijiazhuang,
China. Criteria for sequential enrolment of
patients with bladder cancer were: (I) histo-
pathological diagnosis of bladder transi-
tional cell carcinoma for the first time; (II)
no history of other tumour; (III) no anti-
tumour therapy prior to surgery; (IV) avail-
ability of sufficient tumour tissue and
follow-up data. Tumour diagnosis, staging
(Union for International Cancer Control
system) and grading (World Health
Organization histological system), treatment
and follow-up were completed according to
international standards.14 Control bladder
epithelial tissues were obtained from inpa-
tients with nonmalignant urinary diseases,
including benign prostatic hyperplasia and
bladder calculus. Control tissues were exam-
ined pathologically to exclude the possibility
of incidental tumours. Criteria for sequen-
tial enrolment of controls were: (I) no
histopathological diagnosis of bladder
cancer; (II) no history of tumour; (III) no
anti-tumour therapy prior to surgery; (IV)
availability of sufficient bladder epithelial
tissues and follow-up data. Following
Wang et al. 293
surgery, patients with bladder cancer were
followed-up for 5 years at 3­12 month
intervals. Patients were excluded if they left
the study half way or less through the
follow-up period. Tumour samples were
collected during surgery and all tissue spe-
cimens were promptly frozen in liquid nitro-
gen and stored at À80C prior to DNA
extraction and methylation-specific poly-
merase chain reaction (PCR).
This study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by the ethics committee of the
Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University,
Shijiazhuang, China. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each participant.
DNA extraction, bisulfite
modification and
methylation-specific PCR
Genomic DNA was obtained from tissue
samples using the DNeasyÕ Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) following the
manufacturer's instructions. Prior to methy-
lation-specific PCR, the extracted DNA was
treated with bisulfite to convert unmethy-
lated cytosines to uracils using the EpiTectÕ
Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The methyla-
tion status of the PCDH17 gene was exam-
ined by methylation-specific PCR as
reported previously.7 Briefly, the primer
sequences for the unmethylated PCDH17
reaction were as follows: PCDH17
unmethylated sense (UMS) (sense), 50-
AGATTATTGGGTGTTGTAGTTT-30;
and PCDH17 unmethylated antisense
(UMAS) (antisense), 50-AACCCTAACAC
AACATACACA-30, which amplified a 90-
base pair product. The primers for the
methylated PCDH17 reaction were as fol-
lows: PCDH17 methylated sense (MS)
(sense), 50-GATTATCGGGTGTCGTAG
TTC-30; and PCDH17 methylated antisense
(MAS) (anti-sense), 50-CCCTAACGCAAC
GTACGCG-30, which amplified an 87-base
pair product. Each PCR reaction was car-
ried out in a total volume of 25 ml, including:
100 ng DNA template and 0.2 ml (5 U/ml)
TaKaRa TaqTM DNA polymerase
(TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China),
0.2 mM of each primer, 2.5 mM magnesium
chloride, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide
triphosphate, 2.5 ml 10 Â PCR buffer
(TaKaRa Biotechnology). PCR amplifica-
tion of the modified DNA samples consisted
of denaturation at 95C for 10 min, followed
by 40 cycles at 94C for 30 s, 60C for 30 s,
and 72C for 30 s for the methylated reac-
tion or 42 cycles of 94C for 30 s, 60C for
30 s, and 72C for 30 s for the unmethylated
reaction, and a final extension for all reac-
tions at 72C for 5 min, using a BD
Biosciences thermal cycler (Hercules, CA,
USA). Water blanks were included with
each assay. PCR products were separated
on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium
bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet
illumination.
Samples were scored as follows: methy-
lation positive, bands visible in the methy-
lated reaction lane or in both the methylated
and unmethylated lanes; methylation nega-
tive, bands visible only in the unmethylated
reaction lane. Each methylation-specific
PCR was performed in triplicate, and results
were confirmed by repeating methylation-
specific PCR assays for all samples.
Statistical analyses
Fisher's exact test or 2-test was used to
evaluate the difference in PCDH17 methy-
lation status between patients with bladder
cancer and controls, and to assess the rela-
tionships between PCDH17 methylation
and clinicopathological parameters. The dif-
ference in overall survival between patients
with bladder cancer and methylated
PCDH17 and patients with bladder cancer
and unmethylated PCDH17 was assessed
using Kaplan­Meier survival analysis and
log-rank test. A multivariate Cox

proportional hazards model was used to
estimate the independent prognostic effect of
PCDH17 methylation, controlling for risk
factors, including grade, stage and tumour
size.15­17 A two sided P-value < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SAS software, version 8.0 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC, USA) for WindowsÕ.
Results
Tumour samples were collected from a total
of 115 patients with bladder transitional cell
carcinoma (82 male and 33 female patients,
median age 68 years, range 22­85 years)
comprising 82 transurethral resection and 33
cystectomy cases (Table 1). Normal bladder
epithelial tissues (controls) were obtained
from 43 patients with nonmalignant urinary
diseases (31 male and 12 female patients,
median age 67 years, range 23­87 years)
comprising 12 benign prostatic hyperplasia
and 31 bladder calculus cases. There were no
statistically significant between-group differ-
ences in terms of age and sex.
Methylation of the PCDH17 promoter
was present in 77/115 (67.0%) tumour sam-
ples from patients with bladder cancer
(Figure 1) and none of the control samples
(P < 0.0001). In patients with bladder
cancer, PCDH17 methylation was found to
be significantly associated with advanced
stage (P ¼ 0.0171), high grade (P ¼ 0.0082),
large tumour diameter (P ¼ 0.0004) and
tumour recurrence (P ¼ 0.0063) compared
with the unmethylated gene. No association
was found between PCDH17 methylation
and age, sex, smoking, tumour number or
tumour morphology (Table 1).
Patients with PCDH17 promoter methy-
lation had significantly shorter survival

sion analysis revealed that PCDH17 pro-

Discussion
Bladder cancer is a common worldwide
disease, with high morbidity and mortality
rates.18 More than 90% of bladder cancers
are transitional cell carcinomas.18 Thus,
patients with bladder transitional cell car-
cinoma were selected as subjects in the
present study. Bladder cancer is a disease
driven by multistep accumulation of genetic
and epigenetic changes.6 Epigenetic alter-
ations, including RNA interference, histone
modifications and DNA methylation, may
result in the silencing of cancer related genes,
including tumour suppressor genes.19
Moreover, DNA methylation is the most
common epigenetic aberration in human
malignancies.20 Therefore, detecting pro-
moter methylation changes in tumour

suppressor genes could aid in the early
diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis of
bladder cancer. DNA methylation is a
major mechanism of inactivation of
tumour suppressor genes, besides genetic
changes. In addition, DNA methylation can
be used as a biomarker for tumour diagno-
sis, surveillance and prognosis, which will
contribute to clinical decision-making and
individualized treatment.20,21 Promoter
methylation of PCDH17 has been reported
in several human cancers, including bladder
cancer, but the clinical significance of
PCDH17 methylation in patients with blad-
der cancer remains unclear.7,13
The human PCDH17 gene is located on
chromosome 13q21.2 and functions as a
tumour suppressor in human cancers.7,13
The PCDH17 protein is a member of the
cadherin superfamily. The protocadherins
differ from classic cadherins in that their
heterophilic interactions with other mol-
ecules may be more important for their
various physiological functions than simple
cell adhesion involving homophilic inter-
actions.22 PCDH17 may have multiple
tumour-suppressive functions potentially
contributing to cell­cell adhesion, signal
transduction and growth control. In one
study, methylation of the PCDH17 pro-
moter was associated with the silencing of
gene expression in oesophageal squamous
cell carcinoma, which was associated with
tumour malignancy, while restoration of
PCDH17 expression was found to reduce
cell proliferation, migration and invasion.22
Similar results were also found in gastric and
colorectal cancers.7 Moreover, PCDH17
promoter methylation may frequently
occur in urological cancers.13 Thus, the
current study aimed to investigate the clin-
ical significance of PCDH17 promoter
methylation in bladder cancer.
In the current study, promoter methyla-
tion of PCDH17 was found in 67.0% of
bladder cancer tissues and was not detected
in normal bladder epithelial tissues, suggest-
ing that PCDH17 promoter methylation is
tumour-specific and may be a potential
biomarker in bladder cancer. Subsequently,
the relationship between PCDH17 promoter
methylation and clinicopathological param-
eters was analysed, revealing that methyla-
tion was significantly associated with
advanced stage and high grade tumours,
larger tumour diameter and tumour recur-
rence, which are all known risk factors for
progression and poor prognosis in bladder
cancer.23­25 The current results suggest that
PCDH17 promoter methylation may be a
useful biomarker for bladder cancer malig-
nancy, similar to studies investigating

gastric and colorectal cancers.7,12 In terms of
prognosis prediction, patients in the current
study with PCDH17 promoter methylation
had significantly shorter survival times than
those without methylation. In addition,
multivariate Cox regression analysis indi-
cated that PCDH17 promoter methylation
was an independent predictor for prognosis
in bladder cancer. The findings of the cur-
rent study suggest that for patients with
PCDH17 methylation, aggressive post-
operative intervention should be performed,
in order to achieve better prognosis.
Previous studies have demonstrated that
other members of the cadherin superfamily,
including CDH13, PCDH8 and PCDH10,
were frequently found to be methylated in
bladder cancer tissues, and this methylation
was found to be associated with malignant
behaviour and poor prognosis.10,15,26 These
findings promoted the current investigation
into the clinical significance of PCDH17 in
bladder cancer, and suggest an important
role for the cadherins in terms of disease
progression and clinical outcomes.
This present study is limited by the small
sample size. Larger scale prospective studies
are needed to confirm our findings.
In conclusion, the current study sug-
gests that PCDH17 promoter methylation
is closely associated with malignant blad-
der cancer and may be used as an inde-
pendent predictor of clinical outcomes in
patients with bladder cancer. Detection of
PCDH17 promoter methylation in tumour
samples following surgery may be used to
predict which patients need more aggres-
sive postoperative intervention. In add-
ition, DNA methylation is reversible.
PCDH17 promoter methylation may
therefore be a good therapeutic target in
bladder cancer.
