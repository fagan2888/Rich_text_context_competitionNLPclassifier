Attachment Classifications Among 18-Month-Old
Children of Adolescent Mothers
Lynne Andreozzi, PhD; Patricia Flanagan, MD; Ronald Seifer, PhD; Susan Brunner; Barry Lester, PhD
Objectives: To determine (1) patterns of secure vs in-
secure attachment relationships in infants of adolescent
and nonadolescent mothers and (2) if these patterns are
mediated by parenting characteristics, including depres-
sion, self-esteem, parenting stress, child abuse poten-
tial, psychological distress, rating of infant tempera-
ment, and the caregiving environment.
Participants: Fifty-one adolescent mothers and their
18-month-old infants were compared with 76 nonado-
lescent mothers and their 18-month-old infants.
Main Outcome Measures: Infant attachment classi-
fications were assessed via the Ainsworth Strange Situ-
ation. Maternal and infant characteristics were obtained
through self-report measures.
Results: There were no differences in attachment clas-
sification between infants of adolescent mothers and non-
adolescent mothers. Secure attachment classification was
found in 67% of the infants of adolescent mothers and
62% of the infants of nonadolescent mothers. There were
significant differences in the self-reported maternal char-
acteristics. Adolescent mothers reported lower self-
esteem (P.05), more parenting stress (P.05), more
child abuse potential (P.05), and provided a lower qual-
ity of home environment (P.05) than nonadolescent
mothers. Adolescent mothers also rated their infants as
having a higher activity level (P.05) than infants born
to nonadolescent mothers. In multivariate analysis, none
of these variables or social classes were found to affect
attachment classification.
Conclusions: Infants of adolescent and nonadolescent
mothers show similar patterns of attachment. Adoles-
cent and nonadolescent mothers show substantial dif-
ferences in parenting characteristics and in how they rate
their infants' temperaments. However, these differences
do not seem to impair the infant-mother attachment re-
lationship.

ADOLESCENT mothers are
thought to lack the skills
to adequately mother their
infants. Findings suggest
that adolescent mothers
provide less optimal caregiving, less sen-
sitivity to their infants' cues, less interac-
tive sensitivity, and less emotional and
verbal responsiveness than nonadoles-
cent mothers.1-4 Observation of the home
environment suggests that adolescent
mothers provide a less than optimal set-
tingfortheirchildren,includinglessstimu-
lation, inconsistent learning environ-
ments, more negative interaction, more
restrictive, irritable, hostile, and punitive
responses, and a tendency to choose physi-
cal rather than verbal modalities during in-
teraction with their children.1,4-8
These concerns about the parenting
abilitiesofadolescentmothershavebeenat-
tributed to their lack of knowledge about
child development in general, a poor un-
derstanding of their infants' developmen-
tal abilities, and, probably related, the
tendency to rate their infants' behavior or
temperament as being more difficult.6,9,10
The offspring of adolescent mothers are
thought to be at risk for poor outcome in
childhood, including behavior problems,
poor communicative skills, cognitive im-
pairment, and school failure.11-17 One pos-
sible source of later problems in the off-
spring of adolescent mothers is early
impairment in the mother-child attach-
ment relationship. If adolescent mothers
provide less optimal and/or less sensitive
caregiving to their infants, it is reasonable
to hypothesize that the quality of the at-
tachment relationship would be compro-
mised in adolescent mother-infant dyads.
Despite nearly 3 decades of research
since the advent of the Ainsworth Strange
Situation18 to qualify the attachment rela-
tionship in a behavioral observation set-
ting, surprisingly little is known about at-

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
One hundred forty pairs of mothers and their 18-month-
old infants (80 nonadolescent mother-infant pairs en-
rolled in the Providence, RI, site of the National Institutes
of Health Maternal Lifestyle Study [MLS] and 60 adoles-
cent mother-infant pairs) participated in the study. All sub-
jects were initially recruited to be part of a prospective study
aimed at examining the effects of maternal lifestyles dur-
ing pregnancy on a variety of infant outcomes. The MLS is
a multisite (Providence, Miami [Fla], Memphis [Tenn], and
Detroit [Mich]) longitudinal study of the effects of prena-
tal cocaine/opiate exposure on child outcome conducted
under the auspices of the National Institute on Child Health
and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. Ado-
lescent mothers (18 years) were excluded from MLS.
Therefore, we recruited a separate cohort of adolescent
mothers for the current study. Recruitment of the adoles-
cent cohort occurred in parallel to recruitment for MLS and
followed the same study protocol. The MLS sample in-
cludes a group of infants exposed to cocaine/opiates and a
comparison group of infants not exposed. Exposure was
determined by a meconium toxicology screen followed by
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry confirmation and/or
self-report.30 Only mothers who denied cocaine/opiate use
and whose infants showed negative meconium results were
included in the comparison group. This comparison group
formed the older mother group for the current study. Ma-
ternal report and meconium testing were also used to verify
that mothers in the adolescent group did not use cocaine
and/or opiates during this pregnancy. In addition, be-
cause we were interested in the mother-infant attachment
relationship, only biological mothers who had been living
with the paired infants since birth and had been the pri-
mary caretakers of these infants were included. Primary care-
taker was determined by maternal responses to the follow-
ing questions: "Who makes decisions about the baby's care?"
"Who bathes and changes the baby?" "Who feeds the baby
during the day and at night?" "Who plays with the baby the
most?" This information was collected at various time pe-
riodsthroughoutthestudy.Informationregardingtheamount
of care provided by other caretakers, such as relatives or day
care centers, was not collected. Subjects from the adoles-
cent group were not included if they did not complete the
research procedure (9 subjects), technical problems were ex-
perienced during videotaping (7), the mother was not pres-
ent for the assessment and another caregiver was used (1),
or the mother was not the primary caregiver (1). The re-
maining 51 subjects comprised the adolescent sample.
Subjects were excluded from the sample of older mothers
because the mother was not the primary caregiver (1) or
data were incomplete (3). The total number of subjects in
the nonadolescent sample was 76. The mother-infant dy-
ads were seen when the infants were aged 1, 4, 8, 10, and
18 months.
MEASURES
One Month Old
Demographicandmedicalinformationincludedmaternaledu-
cation,race,parity,numberofprenatalcarevisits,birthweight,
gestational age, sex, 1- and 5-minute Apgar scores, and the
amount of alcohol, marijuana, and cigarette use during this
pregnancy.Becauseofthenatureofobtaininginformationvia
self-report, sample sizes reflected in the tables may not total
N. A continuous measure of SES or index of social position
was computed. This measure was derived from a variety of
factors,includingoccupation,contributiontohouseholdin-
come, and education. A higher score reflects higher SES.
Four Months Old
Parenting stress was measured using the Parenting Stress In-
ventory (PSI).31 This 36-item short-form PSI measures stress
related to parenting. The mother rates each item on a 5-point
Likert scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly dis-
agree." The PSI yields 3 subscales and a summary index of
total stress. This was the only summary index used in this
study. Higher scores reflect more parenting stress.
Maternal depression was assessed using the Beck De-
pression Inventory.32 The Beck Depression Inventory is a
21-item self-report scale that measures symptoms of de-
pression. Scale item responses range from zero to 3 and items
are summed to obtain an overall score. A higher score re-
flects more depressive symptoms.
Maternal psychological distress was measured with the
Brief Symptom Inventory,33 a 53-item questionnaire that
is the short form of the Revised 90-item Symptom Check-
list. The Brief Symptom Inventory yields 9 primary symp-
tom dimensions as well as a global severity index. Higher
scores reflect more psychological distress. Only the global
score was used.
Infant temperament was assessed with the Infant Be-
havior Questionnaire.34 The Infant Behavior Question-
naire is a 90-item questionnaire administered to the mother
to measure her perceptions of the infant's temperament
and behavior in everyday situations. This measure yields

tween these 2 samples, significant differences were found.
In the remaining study, which did not include a compari-
son group, most infants were seen as securely attached.23
In other populations, the quality of the mother-
infant attachment relationship has been related to
maternal factors, including self-esteem,24 mental ill-
ness,25-27 and stress in the family.28 Also, maternal per-
ceptions of infant temperament have been associated with
infant behavior in the Strange Situation.29
The purposes of this study were 2-fold. First, we
wanted to study the attachment relationship in infants
of adolescent mothers in a sample with an appropriate
comparison group of older mothers and with sufficient
statistical power to detect hypothesized differences. Sec-
ond, we wanted to study maternal factors thought to dif-
ferentiate adolescent mothers from older mothers that
might be related to hypothesized differences in attach-
ment.Thefactorsincludeddepression,self-esteem,parent-
Distress to Approach Sudden or Novel Stimuli, Distress to
Limitations, Soothability, and Duration of Orienting.
Eight Months Old
The Child Abuse Potential Inventory35 is a 77-item self-
report scale that examines maternal psychological difficul-
ties such as distress, rigidity, and unhappiness, and also in-
teractional problems experienced by the mother, such as
problems with self, family, or others. Scores are generated
for each of the factors and a total score. Only the total score
was used.
Ten Months Old
Maternal self-esteem was assessed via the Maternal Self-
Report Inventory.36 The Maternal Self-Report Inventory is
a 26-item scale that yields a total score that reflects the moth-
er's self-esteem. A higher score indicates increased self-
esteem.
The Home Observation for Measurement of the En-
vironment (HOME)37 was administered during a home visit.
This instrument is useful for measuring the social and emo-
tional support available within the infant's home.37 The 45
scale items are scored on the basis of observations of the
home and on interviews with the mother. Only the total
score was used.
Eighteen Months Old
Mothers brought their children to the hospital clinic for
assessment of attachment using the Ainsworth Strange Situ-
ation.18 The Strange Situation is a laboratory procedure con-
sisting of 8 episodes in which the mother and child inter-
act with each other and with a stranger unknown to the
infant, and then they are separated from and reunited with
each other. The procedure is videotaped and infant attach-
ment classifications are assigned based on coding of the vid-
eotape.
Infants are classified as secure (B) or 1 of 2 categories
of insecure attachment: insecure-avoidant (A) or insecure-
resistant (C).18 Infants in the B category derive comfort from
their mothers as evidenced by seeking proximity to her. At
the same time, B infants display a willingness to explore
the environment. Infants in the A category may ignore or
snub the mother on reunion. Infants in the C category may
show a mixture of seeking and resisting contact with the
mother. These infants may display much distress and an-
ger regarding the mother's departure. In addition, some in-
fants are classified as disorganized (D).38 Infants in the D
category lack a clear attachment strategy and may display
odd or disoriented behavior such as freezing, stilling,
affective instability, or apprehension of the mother. D is
not a mutually exclusive category. Infants may be classi-
fied into 1 of the above 3 categories and also as D. Some
infants may display a mixture of both avoidant and resis-
tant strategies and are classified as A/C. These infants also
receive a D classification. Occasionally, infants may not be
able to be classified into one of the above categories and
are deemed unclassifiable (U).
DATA ANALYSIS
Our hypothesis was that infants of adolescent mothers would
more often be classified as insecure than secure. There-
fore, consistent with previous research, for data analysis
to compare secure vs insecure, we combined the number
of infants in the A and C categories and compared them
with the number of infants in the B category. Infants clas-
sified as either A/C or U were omitted from the analyses.
Separate analyses that included A/C and U categories (data
not shown) were conducted and yielded the same results
included in this report. This classification scheme is well
established and was implemented by the first author after
training and certification by the third author. Interrater re-
liability of the adolescent sample was evaluated on 20% of
the sample with another independent certified coder (S.B.)
and was 94%. The older mother sample was coded by ei-
ther of the 2 certified coders.
We recognized the difficulty of maintaining blindness
in this study due to the physical appearance of the adoles-
cent mothers. To help address this issue and strengthen
the study findings, we included 11 additional Strange Situ-
ation tapes that had been previously scored from another
group of mothers aged 18 to 20 years with the tapes of the
adolescent sample. These tapes were not identified but
were recoded as part of the pool of adolescent tapes and
were found to have classifications identical to their origi-
nal scoring, suggesting that scoring bias may not have
occurred.
Power analysis was conducted to determine if a sta-
tistically significant (P.05) difference in the proportion
of infants of adolescent vs older mothers classified as se-
cure (B) vs insecure (A or C) could be detected with this
sample size. The power was .87, which was adequate.39
Statistical analyses included t tests for continuous data
and 2 tests for categorical data to compare demographic,
medical (Table 1 and Table 2), and maternal psycho-
logical characteristics (Table 3) between the 2 groups. A
2 test was used to compare the distribution of attachment
classification categories between the 2 groups (Table 4)
and logistic regression to predict attachment classifica-
tion from maternal age group, sociodemograhic, and ma-
ternal psychological characteristics (Table 5).

RESULTS
DEMOGRAPHICS
Maternaldemographiccharacteristicsfortheadolescentand
older mother groups are presented in Table 1. Mothers in
the nonadolescent sample were more likely to have more
than 1 living child (parity) than mothers in the adolescent
sample. Mothers in the older sample were more likely to
have a higher SES than the mothers in the younger sample.
Most mothers in the adolescent sample had an index of so-
cial position, which reflected that they were primarily in
thelowerandmiddletolowersocioeconomicgroups.Most
subjects in the nonadolescent sample fell in the middle to
upper-middle class range. Similarly, level of education as
measured by number of years of school completed was sig-
nificantly lower in the adolescent group. A higher propor-
tionofthenonadolescentmothersweremarried,therewere
more black women in the nonadolescent group, and more

nancy was more common in the nonadolescent group.
INFANT CHARACTERISTICS
Infant characteristics are presented in Table 2. There were
no significant differences between the 2 groups on birth
weight, gestational age, Apgar scores, or sex. There were
also no differences in proportions of infants with birth
weight less than 2500 g or gestational age less than 37
weeks between the 2 groups.

sample, 66.7% of the infants were classified as B, 17.7%
were classified as A, and 7.8% were classified as C. In the
nonadolescent sample, 61.8% of the infants were classi-
fied as B, 11.8% were classified as A, and 11.8% were clas-
sified as C. One infant in the adolescent sample and 6
infants in the nonadolescent sample were unable to be
classified. There were 3 infants in the adolescent group
and 5 infants in the nonadolescent group that showed a
mixed (A/C) classification. In addition, 10% of the in-
fants in the adolescent group and 19.7% of the infants
in the nonadolescent group were rated as D.
There were 13 infants (25.4%) classified as inse-
cure (A or C) in the adolescent group and 18 infants
(23.6%) classified as insecure (A or C) in the nonado-
lescent group. There were no differences in the number
of secure vs insecure infants between the 2 groups
(2=.003, P = .99). Similarly, there were no differences
in the number of disorganized infants between the 2
groups (2=2.27, P = .13). Neither of these 2 test re-
sults was significant, indicating that there was no differ-
ence in the proportion of insecurity or disorganization
between the 2 groups. Additional analyses were con-
ducted to determine if attachment classifications dif-
fered according to other variables of interest, such as race/
ethnicity, sex, birth weight, and gestational age. There
were no differences between each of these variables and
attachment classification.
MATERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL
CHARACTERISTICS
Table 3 presents the means and SDs for the maternal self-
report and the home observation measures. There were
no differences between adolescent and nonadolescent
mothers in symptoms of depression (Beck Depression In-
ventory) or level of psychological distress (Brief Symp-
tom Inventory). However, compared with nonadoles-
cent mothers, adolescent mothers showed more parenting
stress (PSI), lower maternal self-esteem (Maternal Self-
Report Inventory), a higher child abuse potential (Child
Abuse Potential Inventory), a higher activity level in their
infant's temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire),
and provided a less adequate home environment (HOME).
Results of the logistic regression predicting secure
vsinsecureattachmentclassificationarepresentedinTable
5. As planned, variables used in the logistic regression,
in addition to the adolescent or the nonadolescent group,
were those variables that differentiated between these
2 groups, which might "explain" attachment. The logis-
tic regression showed a nonsignificant 2 test (2=5.6,
P.05) and no significant odds ratios for any of the in-
dividual predictor variables, suggesting that none of these
factors were related to attachment classification.
COMMENT
Three of 5 previously published studies found no in-
crease in secure vs insecure attachment classification us-
ing the Ainsworth Strange Situation in infants of adoles-
cent mothers.19,21,23 One study that found differences used
another sample of adolescent mothers as the compari-
son group.22 The remaining study used the Ainsworth
sample18 for comparison.20 In findings from cross-
cultural normative studies, the modal classification is
noted as secure (B).40 The previously mentioned meta-
analysis40 identified the Ainsworth sample18 as the cri-
terion standard. In this sample, approximately 66% of in-
fants were classified as securely attached.18 This is virtually
identical to our finding of 66.7% secure attachment in
the adolescent group. Ours is the largest study to date,
to our knowledge, with sufficient power to suggest that
lack of differences between adolescent and nonadoles-
cent mothers was probably not due to a type II error.
Moreover, ours is the only study, of adolescent mothers
to deal with the issue of examiner blindness. Our find-
ings suggest that infants of adolescent mothers may re-
semble normative samples in the prevalence of secure at-
tachments to their mothers.
We did find, consistent with other findings, differ-
ences between adolescent and nonadolescent mothers on
demographic and parenting factors. Differences on de-
mographic factors, such as SES, marital status, parity, and
educationare,ofcourse,tobeexpected.Othershavefound
lower self-esteem,41,42 higher levels of depression,42 higher
child abuse potential scores,11 and poorer quality home
environments among adolescent mothers.5 Differences
in how adolescent mothers perceive their infant's tem-
perament have also been reported.10 Our findings were
similar. We found more parenting distress, lower mater-
nal self-esteem, higher child abuse potential scores, and
poorer quality home environment in adolescent moth-
ers. In addition, these mothers perceived their infants as
having a more active temperament than nonadolescent
mothers perceived. Although there is reason to suspect
that these factors would contribute to infant attachment
classification, we found no such relationships. The com-

bination of adolescent or nonadolescent mother group,
sociodemographic, and parenting factors in the logistic
regression was unrelated to secure or insecure attach-
ment classification. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to determine if parenting factors predict attach-
ment classification in adolescent mothers. It is interest-
ing that factors theoretically shown or assumed to affect
the quality of the attachment relationship, such as ma-
ternal self esteem, parenting stress, SES, and psychologi-
cal distress, were unrelated to attachment in this study.
These findings support the robustness of the attach-
ment relationship and the results reported herein.
The Ainsworth Strange Situation18 has been widely
used and is acknowledged as the criterion standard
method for measuring attachment.40 In addition to nor-
mative studies, this procedure has been found to differ-
entiate among other areas of study, including abuse and
neglect,43,44 childhood aggression,45 clinical depression
in mothers,25,27 and cross-cultural differences in Israel,46
Japan,47 and Germany.48 Therefore, we do not attribute
our lack of differences between adolescent and nonado-
lescent mothers to problems with the procedure. In ad-
dition, our coders were well trained, and as mentioned
earlier we did attempt to determine if there was bias due
to the appearance of the adolescent mothers.
A more likely explanation for our findings is that
the attachment system is robust and difficult to impair
and may not be compromised by factors such as adoles-
cent parenting or the maternal factors that we studied.
This is consistent with attachment theory, in which at-
tachment is viewed as a proximity promoting system im-
portant for survival.49
We did find important differences between adoles-
cent and nonadolescent mothers. Adolescent mothers
showed more parenting distress, lower maternal self-
esteem, higher child abuse potential scores, poorer qual-
ity home environments, and perceived their infants as
being more active. In other studies, similar factors have
been shown to affect child outcome.50,51 The differences
found in the adolescent sample may affect aspects of the
child (ie, behavior and development) that we did not mea-
sure. Therefore, these factors may still affect offspring of
adolescent mothers even if they do not affect the attach-
ment relationship.
We did not measure other aspects of adolescent
mothers that could have influenced our results, such as
social support and the adolescent mother's developmen-
tal level and knowledge of child development. It has been
suggested51 that adolescent parenting may not invari-
ably be associated with adversity. The developmental pro-
cess may affect the mothering experience of adolescents
and provide opportunities for intervention.51
Although the Strange Situation and the HOME were
based on direct observation, other measures were based
on self-report (stress, depression, temperament, etc). It
is possible that study findings would differ with more ob-
jective measures of some of these factors.
Although adolescent mothers are often portrayed as
disadvantaged and they clearly differ from nonadoles-
cent mothers in potentially important areas of parent-
ing, our findings add to a growing body of literature sug-
gesting that the ability of these mothers to maintain a
secure attachment relationship with their infants is simi-
lar to that of mothers in the general population. This and
other research suggest that adolescent mothers may not
be a homogeneous group--that there are important in-
dividual differences in the parenting ability of these moth-
ers. If we are going to understand how these mothers par-
ent, how their parenting affects the outcome of their
children, and how to develop effective interventions, we
will need to pay more attention to patterns of individual
differences in parenting.

What This Study Adds
This study contributes to the knowledge of adolescent
parenting and outcome of infants of adolescent parents.
Our research attempts to supplement a weak literature
base regarding the attachment relationship of infants of
adolescent mothers. Little is known about this relation-
ship. One of the strengths of this examination is the com-
parison of the target population with a demographi-
cally similar sample, one of older nonadolescent mothers
and their infants.
Here, infants of adolescent and nonadolescent moth-
ers show similar patterns of attachment. Adolescent and
nonadolescent mothers show substantial differences in
parenting characteristics; however, these differences do
not seem to impair the attachment relationship with their
infants. Therefore, there may be important individual dif-
ferences in the parenting ability of adolescent mothers.
