Gun use in the United States: results from two
national surveys
D Hemenway, D Azrael, M Miller
Abstract
Objectives--To determine the relative in-
cidence of gun victimization versus self
defense gun use by civilians in the United
States, and the circumstances and prob-
able legality of the self defense uses.
Methods--National random digit dial
telephone surveys of the adult population
were conducted in 1996 and 1999. The
Harvard surveys appear unique among
private surveys in two respects: asking (1)
open ended questions about defensive gun
use incidents and (2) detailed questions
about both gun victimization and self
defense gun use. Five criminal court
judges were asked to assess whether the
self reported defensive gun uses were
likely to have been legal.
Results--Even after excluding many re-
ported firearm victimizations, far more
survey respondents report having been
threatened or intimidated with a gun than
having used a gun to protect themselves. A
majority of the reported self defense gun
uses were rated as probably illegal by a
majority of judges. This was so even under
the assumption that the respondent had a
permit to own and carry the gun, and that
the respondent had described the event
honestly.
Conclusions--Guns are used to threaten
and intimidate far more often than they
are used in self defense. Most self reported
self defense gun uses may well be illegal
and against the interests of society.

The United States has a higher homicide rate
than other developed nations, and most of our
murders are committed with firearms. On an
average day in the 1990s in the United States,
35­50 Americans were murdered with fire-
arms, and another 120­160 were shot in
assaults but did not die.1 Shootings that result
in injury are a small percentage of hostile
events involving firearms.2 In some of these
events guns may thwart criminal assaults, in
others they may be instruments of aggression.
Evidence about the incidence and character-
istics of gun victimization and self defense gun
use come from two types of survey. The first is
the large, public National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS). The NCVS, conducted by the
Census Bureau for the Bureau of Justice
Statistics, asks questions of the same household
every six months for three years. By excluding
incidents reported in the first interview (that is,
by "bounding" the responses), the NCVS
greatly reduces the substantial problem of "tel-
escoping" (the reporting of events that actually
occurred outside the time frame in question).
In criminal victimization surveys, telescoping
can increase estimates by between 40% and
50% depending on the type of crime; the infla-
tion rate is greatest for violent crimes.3 4
The NCVS focuses on six specific serious
crimes (for example, assault, rape, robbery)
and asks the respondent whether s/he has been
the victim of an attempted or completed crime
within the preceding six months. Follow up
questions ask whether the oVender used a gun
in the criminal attempt, as well as what, if any-
thing, the respondent did to protect him/
herself. Estimates from the NCVS suggest that
each year about one million violent crimes
involve guns while victims use guns in self
defense perhaps 60 000 to 120 000 times.5 6
Many smaller, one shot private surveys have
asked one or more questions about self defense
gun use.7 Estimates of self defense gun use
from such surveys are an order of magnitude
higher than the NCVS estimates. Two features
of these private surveys probably explain most
of this diVerence: (1) responses are unbounded
and (2) all respondents are asked about defen-
sive gun use, not just those respondents who
report that they have been the victim of an
attempted crime.8­11 These two features should
also make private survey estimates of gun
victimization higher than the NCVS estimates.2
In 1996 and 1999 national surveys focusing
on defensive and oVensive gun use were
conducted under the auspices of the Harvard
Injury Control Research Center. The Harvard
surveys appear to be the only private surveys to
ask either (1) open ended questions about
defensive gun uses, or (2) detailed questions of
each respondent about both gun victimization
and self defense gun uses. This article presents
evidence on the relative frequency and circum-
stances of these two types of gun use, as well as
on their probable legality.
Methods
Data come from two national random digit dial
surveys conducted by Fact Finders, Inc in the
spring of 1996 and the spring of 1999. The
samples comprise, respectively, 1905 and 2521
adults living in the 50 states.
The samples were stratified by state, with the
number of interviews designated for each state
determined by that state's population relative
to the total population according to the 1990
census. All households with a single telephone
line, including those with unlisted numbers,
had an equal probability of inclusion in the

sample. Households without a telephone were
excluded from the sample.
No more than one adult from each house-
hold was interviewed. Rather than interview
the adult who happened to be at home at the
time of the call, the interviewers alternately
asked to speak with a man or with a woman liv-
ing in the household. If there was no adult liv-
ing in the household of the requested gender,
the initial respondent was interviewed. Results
show unweighted data.
Once a telephone number was randomly
selected, as many as 10 repeat phone calls were
made until a final disposition was assigned. In
1996, 27% of contacted households refused to
participate in the survey; in 1999, 35% refused.
These response rates are comparable to other
self defense gun use surveys.11 12
Respondents who answered yes to either gun
use qualifying question were asked up to 30
follow up questions about the most recent
event, including an open ended question which
asked them to describe the incident. All results
eliminate respondents who were police oYcers,
security guards, or military personnel. Results
also eliminate cases in which the respondent
reported that the event occurred more than five
years before the survey or outside the United
States.
In the case of hostile gun displays, we also
eliminated incidents in which the respondent
refused to provide any detailed information
about the event at the time of the initial inter-
view, the respondent appeared to be an
observer rather a participant in the event, or
was thought to be a criminal (for example, by
the police). We were more stringent about what
was counted as a hostile gun display, and more
permissive about was counted as a self defense
gun use.
The specific qualifying questions in both
surveys were similar.13 In 1999 respondents
were asked "In the past five years, has anyone
used, displayed or brought out a gun in a hos-
tile manner against you [italics added], even if
this event did not take place as part of the
commission of a crime?" The 1996 question
did not include the "against you" and so
obtained more instances when the respondent
was merely a witness.
The 1999 survey inadvertently omitted an
open ended question about the most recent
hostile gun display. Four to eight months after
the initial interview we tried to recontact all
those who had reported a hostile gun display
against them. We were able to gain a verbatim
description of the most recent event from half
these respondents. In 6% of these instances it
appeared that the respondent merely witnessed
the hostile gun display. In calculating the
number of hostile gun displays, we thus
excluded 6% of all non-contacted respondents
who reported a hostile gun display.
All respondents in the 1999 survey were
asked "In the past five years, have you used,
displayed or brought out a gun in self defense
to protect yourself from a person or people?"
The 1996 survey asked "In the past five years,
have you used a gun to protect yourself from a
person or people?"
In order to obtain a generous estimate of self
defense gun uses, we included incidents even
when the respondent refused to give any infor-
mation about the event or, from the descrip-
tion, it appeared the other party never knew the
respondent displayed the gun.
Self defense gun use incidents were summa-
rized and sent to five criminal court judges
(from California, Pennsylvania, and Massachu-
setts) who were assured anonymity. The judges
were told to assume that the respondent had a
permit to own and carry the gun and had
described the event honestly from his/her own
perspective. The judges were then asked to give
their best guess whether, based on the
respondent's description of the incident, the
respondent's use of the gun was very likely
legal, likely legal, as likely as not legal, unlikely
legal, or very unlikely legal.
Results
The percentages of respondents reporting hos-
tile gun displays in the two surveys are not sta-
tistically diVerent, nor are the percentages of
respondents reporting a self defense gun use.
Results of the two surveys are therefore
combined in the analysis.
HOSTILE GUN DISPLAYS
On the 1996 survey, 122 respondents reported
a hostile gun display against them. We
eliminated over half of these for a variety of
reasons (table 1), leaving 58 civilians who

reported 112 hostile gun displays against them
in the previous five years.2
On the 1999 survey, 131 respondents
reported a hostile gun uses against them. One
man reported 97 gun uses and was excluded.
We also excluded 15 police, security guards
and military personnel, 14 people who re-
sponded that the gun user might have thought
s/he was a criminal, and one who reported that
the event took place six years before the survey.
Of the remaining 100, we received a verbatim
description from 50; 6% appeared to have
merely witnessed the event ("It was between
two other people; a gun was displayed, it could
have ricocheted"). We eliminated 6% of the
100, leaving 94 respondents who reported 159
events.
After appropriate exclusions, 152 respond-
ents from the combined surveys reported 271
incidents (table 1).
Three examples of hostile gun displays
against respondents from the 1999 survey are:
x "I'm a cattle farmer and he's a cattle farmer.
He was putting his bulls and heifers up near
the fence and my bull broke out and he got
mad".
x "I was on a date. He pulled the gun when I
mentioned breaking up with him".
x "I was mugged in New York".
SELF DEFENSE GUN USE
On the 1996 survey, 14 civilian respondents
reported using a gun in self defense in the past
five years, accounting for 54 incidents. On the
1999 survey, 29 civilian respondents reported
using a gun in self defense, accounting for 92
gun uses. For both surveys combined, a total of
146 self defense gun uses were reported by 43
people who were not police, military personnel,
or security guards (table 2).
In each survey, the number of respondents
reporting that they were gun victims exceeded
the number of respondents reporting that they
had used a gun in self defense by over three to
one, 152 to 43 (p<0.001) overall.
On both surveys combined, 2.9% of gun
owners, 0.3% of those living in the home with
someone who owns a gun, and 0.4% of
non-gun owners reported a self defense gun
use (table 3). After eliminating police, security
guards and military personnel, approximately
1% of respondents reported a self defense gun
use (43/4378).
Of the 43 respondents reporting a self
defense gun use, six did not provide a descrip-
tion of the most recent event, and for two more
the descriptions indicated that the respondent
did not use the firearm (for example, one never
encountered the thieves who had stolen his
truck). The criminal court judges were shown
summaries of the remaining 35 events; each
judge rated each event. Twenty per cent of the
time a judge rated a case as "as likely legal as
illegal". Excluding these ratings (when judges
often said there was not enough information), a
majority of the judges rated 18 of the 35 (51%)
as probably illegal and 15 of the 35 (43%) as
probably legal. For two there was no majority
opinion. In 23 of 35 events the judges were
unanimous in their ratings; nine times there
was one dissenter; and in three instances the
ratings were either 3­2 or 2­2 in terms of the
probable legality of the self defense gun use.
Two examples from the 1999 survey of inci-
dents that were unanimously deemed probably
illegal were:
x A 62 year old male said that at 6 pm "the
police called. My alarm at my business went
oV so I went there to shut it oV. Two men
were outside my building, so from my car I
shot at the ground near them". The
respondent said the men were trespassing.
x A 58 year old male was inside his home at 2
pm. "I was watching a movie and [an
acquaintance] interrupted me. I yelled that I
was going to shoot him and he ran to his
car". The respondent said his acquaintance
was committing a verbal assault. The
respondent's gun, a .44 Magnum, was
located "in my holster on me".
Two examples of self defense gun use from
the 1999 survey that were unanimously
deemed probably legal were:
x A 26 year old male was with friends at
another's home. At 8:30 am "a friend of
mine was in the process of getting robbed
and he was drunk. We went to help him just
as the robbers were leaving". The respond-
ent's gun was not loaded and "I never really
took it out of my pocket".
x A 38 year old male was inside his home at 4
am. "Someone broke in; I woke up to the
sound. I got my gun from the safe [loaded it]
and went downstairs. The person left and I
called the police". The respondent did not
know whether the burglar had a weapon.
Over two thirds (68%) of the 146 self
defense gun use incidents from the two surveys
were reported by six respondents. Three people
claimed 50, 20 and 15 self defense incidents in
the previous five years, but refused to describe
the most recent event. In the 1999 survey, an
18 year old male reported six cases. He
described the most recent incident: "I was at

Discussion
Consistent with results from the NCVS and
private one shot surveys,2 we find that far more
respondents report criminal gun uses against
them than self defense gun uses by them. The
results hold even though, in order to be as con-
servative as possible, we (1) eliminate many of
the reported hostile gun uses against the
respondent, and (2) include virtually all the
reported self defense gun uses.
Our surveys yield higher estimates of both
criminal and self defense gun use than does the
NCVS, probably due to telescoping and due to
the fact that our respondents could report a
gun use without first reporting that someone
tried to commit a crime against them.8 11 These
factors need not diVerentially aVect the relative
incidence of gun victimization versus self
defense gun use, which we report here.
However, our results should not be extrapo-
lated to obtain population based estimates of
the absolute number of gun uses. If we have as
little as 1% random misclassification, our
results could be oV by orders of magnitude. It
appears we can obtain substantially higher rates
of self defense gun use if we ask respondents
about events in the previous six months rather
than the previous five years.7 On the other hand,
we can obtain substantially lower rates of self
defense gun use if we eliminate the handful of
respondents who report the vast majority of
uses, the various respondents who report uses
that do not appear to meet reasonable criteria
for actual use, or the respondents whose use
appears oVensive rather than defensive.
While it is sometimes presumed that self
defense gun use is beneficial for society, that
notion has been viewed with increasing skepti-
cism.10 11 It is noteworthy that in prison
surveys, about half of convicted felons who
have fired a gun claim to have done so in self
defense.14
In our survey, the criminal court judges who
rated the incidents determined that at least half
were probably illegal--even after assuming that
the respondent had a permit to own and carry
a gun and described the incident honestly. We
expect that the true percentage of reported self
defense gun uses that are illegal is higher than
50% for at least two reasons.
First, three respondents reported over 58%
of the self defense gun uses, and none of their
accounts were read by the judges (since all
refused to provide a description of the most
recent event). Many reported self defense gun
uses from a respondent creates a suspicion that
the uses may be aggressive rather than
defensive.
Second, the reports read by the judges are
only one side of a hostile interaction that usu-
ally occurred months or years before the
survey. We expect respondents will view the
hostile encounter from their own perspective;
in any mutual combat both participants may
believe that the other side is the aggressor and
that they themselves are acting in self defense.
In addition, when describing the event, re-
spondents will typically want to present them-
selves in the best possible light.15­20
Certainly some self defense gun uses are
legal and in the public interest. But many are
not. The possibility of using a gun in a socially
useful manner--against a criminal during the
commission of a crime--will rarely, if ever,
occur for the average gun owner. By contrast, at
any other moment, the use of a gun against
another human is illegal, and socially undesir-
able. Regular citizens with guns, who are
sometimes tired, angry, drunk or afraid, and
who are not trained in dispute resolution or on
when it is proper to use a firearm, have many
opportunities for inappropriate gun use. People
engage in innumerable annoying and some-
what hostile interactions with others in the
course of a lifetime. We might expect that
unlawful "self defense" gun uses will outnum-
ber the legitimate and socially beneficial ones.
Trained police oYcers are often inad-
equately prepared to handle ambiguous but
potentially dangerous situations. Heavy stress,
confusion, and fear are inherent in most possi-
ble shooting situations. Heart rates skyrocket,
and it is diYcult to think clearly and to act
deliberately. Not surprisingly, even the police
make serious mistakes in their firearm use.
Individuals without training or experience can
be expected to do much worse.
Our findings have various limitations. Our
results are based on self reports of past events,
with the potential of recall bias. The surveys
under-sampled poor people who may have
more hostile conflicts with firearms than their
richer counterparts. The key questions from the
two surveys, though very similar, were not iden-
tical, and neither survey sampled anyone under
age 18. In addition, we have detailed infor-
mation only on the most recent self defense and
criminal gun incidents; to the extent that the
most recent incident is not typical of all the
incidents experienced by the respondent, our
findings may not be representative.
Only five judges, from three states, assessed
the self defense gun incidents from the surveys;

they were a convenience rather than a random
sample, and the sample is too small to be con-
fident of the stability of the aggregate ratings
we report here.
Despite these limitations, our surveys pro-
vide evidence about gun uses in American
society that has not been available before. Our
results indicate that gun use against adults to
threaten and intimidate is far more common
than self defense gun use by them, and that
most self reported self defense gun uses are
probably illegal, and may be against the
interests of society.

From the journals
A report in JAMA shows that the risk of death in cars driven by 16 and 17 year olds is related
to the number of passengers. Using data from various national sources the authors found that
when compared with drivers of the same age who had no passengers, the relative risk of 16
year old drivers' deaths per 10 million trips was 39% higher for those with one passenger,
86% higher for those with two, and nearly three times higher for those with three or more
passengers. Similar patterns were found for 17 year old drivers. Perhaps not surprisingly,
driver crashes were greater when the passengers were male and under 30 and the death rates
for teen drivers were substantially increased late at night. The authors note that a previous
survey of high school drivers found that dangerous driving behaviors were strongly associated
with the presence of peers. They conclude that the results support the need for graduated
driver's licensing system for teens. Such a system is in place in 24 states. An accompanying
editorial by Robert Foss states "This is clear and convincing evidence that state [graduated
driver's licensing] systems should include passenger restrictions during the initial stages of
driver licensing" (JAMA 2000 (March), Li-Hui Chen and colleagues).
Many papers in our most formidable rival, Accident Analysis and Prevention, are noteworthy.
In the January 2000 issue (vol 32) one by Gregersen et al reports on the beneficial eVects of
a 16 years age limit for learner drivers in Sweden (p 25­36) and another, by Elvik, describes
the relevant costs and benefits of road safety measures for pedestrians and drivers (p 37­46),
There is also an exploration of the barriers to bicycle helmet use in 12 and 13 year olds by
Loubeau (p 111­16). The entire March 2000 issue is devoted to whiplash and most of the
papers are quite technical, mainly of interest to engineers. In the May issue the theme was
domestic and personal injury. It includes important papers by Marsh and Kendrick on near
miss and minor injuries; one on burn injuries in the Netherlands (Hertog et al); another on
personal watercraft injuries (Jones). Also included is a report by Macarthur et al on
playground falls and a meta-analysis of studies linking smoking to injury fatalities by
Leistikow et al.
A report based on data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System in the US
notes that injuries at fast food restaurants account for more than one quarter of the occupa-
tional injuries among 15­17 year olds in the US. This makes this the largest single source of
work related injuries in this age group. One of the most important solutions proposed is bet-
ter training, along with proper supervision and safety practices (J Occup Environ Med 1999;
41:1146­53).
