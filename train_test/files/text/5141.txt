What is data justice? The case
for connecting digital rights
and freedoms globally
Linnet Taylor
Abstract
The increasing availability of digital data reflecting economic and human development, and in particular the availability of
data emitted as a by-product of people's use of technological devices and services, has both political and practical
implications for the way people are seen and treated by the state and by the private sector. Yet the data revolution
is so far primarily a technical one: the power of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet been explicitly
connected to a social justice agenda by the agencies and authorities involved. Meanwhile, although data-driven discrim-
ination is advancing at a similar pace to data processing technologies, awareness and mechanisms for combating it are not.
This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea of data justice ­
fairness in the way people are made visible, represented and treated as a result of their production of digital data ­ is
necessary to determine ethical paths through a datafying world. Bringing together the emerging scholarly perspectives on
this topic, I propose three pillars as the basis of a notion of international data justice: (in)visibility, (dis)engagement with
technology and antidiscrimination. These pillars integrate positive with negative rights and freedoms, and by doing so
challenge both the basis of current data protection regulations and the growing assumption that being visible through the
data we emit is part of the contemporary social contract.

Introduction: The case for data justice
As digital data become available on populations that
were previously digitally invisible, policymakers and
researchers worldwide are taking advantage of what
the UN has termed the `data revolution' (United
Nations, 2014). The increasing availability of digital
data reflecting economic and human development,
and in particular of `data fumes' (Thatcher, 2014) ­
data produced as a by-product of people's use of
technological devices and services ­ is driving a shift
in policymaking worldwide from being data informed
to being data driven (Kitchin, 2016). These granular
data sources which allow researchers to infer people's
movements, activities and behaviour have ethical, pol-
itical and practical implications for the way people are
seen and treated by the state and by the private sector
(and, importantly, by both acting in combination).
This distributed visibility has even clearer social and
political implications in the case of low-income envir-
onments, where authorities' ability to gather accurate
statistical data has previously been limited. Yet the data
revolution is so far primarily a technical one: the power
of data to sort, categorise and intervene has not yet
been explicitly connected to a social justice agenda by
those agencies and authorities who collect, manage and
use data. Nor is there a high level of awareness amongst
implementers of how new data technologies may not be
neutral in terms of access, use or impacts, something
that the available research into this phenomenon shows

to be the case (Dalton et al., 2016). In fact, while data-
driven discrimination is advancing at a similar pace to
data processing technologies, awareness and mechan-
isms for combating it are not.
Two trends make developing a global perspective on
the just use of digital data urgently necessary: one is the
exponential rise in technology adoption worldwide, and
the other the corresponding globalisation of data
analytics. Of the world's seven billion mobile phones,
5.5 billion are in low- and middle-income countries
(LMICs), where 2.1 billion people are also online
(ITU, 2015). India and China have commissioned the
creation of hundreds of smart cities that will provide
the ability to track and monitor citizens in every aspect
of their lives (Greenfield, 2013), digital and biometric
registration are becoming the new norm in even the
poorest countries, and practices in international aid,
development and humanitarian response increasingly
use vast amounts of digital data to map, sort and inter-
vene on the mass scale in lower income regions (Taylor,
2015). The reach of the global data market has also
changed to take account of these new sources of data,
with multinational corporations scrambling to profile
billions of potential new consumers (Taylor, 2016a).
Meanwhile, research and praxis on the ways in
which datafication can serve citizenship, freedom and
social justice are minimal in comparison to corpor-
ations and states' ability to use data to intervene and
influence.
This paper posits that just as an idea of justice is
needed in order to establish the rule of law, an idea
of data justice is necessary to determine ethical paths
through a datafying world. Several framings of data
justice are emerging within different fields, which have
the potential to build on each other. I will therefore
analyse the existing work on data justice and place
the different viewpoints in dialogue with each other,
then argue that by finding common principles we can
bring them together into a single framing for further
research and debate. The paper is structured as follows:
I will first outline the reasons for concern relating to the
new public­private interfaces of big data, namely the
disciplinary and frequently discriminatory nature of
large-scale databases used on the population level,
Next, I will use empirical examples to demonstrate
that these concerns are not only amplified but funda-
mentally different in the context of big data. I will then
explore current framings of data justice and identify
which aspects of the problems arising from big data
they propose to address. Next, I will propose an over-
arching conceptualisation of data justice that can
bridge existing approaches and form a basis for dia-
logue between them. Finally, I will argue for Sen and
Nussbaum's Capabilities Approach as a framing for
this conceptualisation, with the aim of providing an
ecosystemic approach that can address institutions,
markets, legal systems and public debates.
A note on methodology: the theoretical and empir-
ical starting points for the framework proposed here
are based on a research project comprising fieldwork,
observation and interviews conducted over the period
2012­2016. This project included 200 formal and infor-
mal interviews and periods of observation conducted
with academic researchers, development aid and
humanitarian organisations, independent technology
developers, activist organisations in the field of data
and rights, large technology firms and policymakers
from the US, EU and several African and Asian coun-
tries. The observation portion of the research was con-
ducted at international events relevant to the
`Responsible Data' movement, through participation
in advisory groups and in public discussions on data
ethics. The interviews were conducted at these events,
and additionally through fieldwork during 2014­2016
at multinational mobile network operators in France
and Norway, and on a public-sector datafication pro-
ject in Bangalore, India.
The problem: Data at the public­private
interface
Why look for ways to relate social justice concerns to
datafication, and vice versa? Why not, for example, pri-
oritise making sure that commercial digital innovation
can proceed unfettered, since this has been argued to
benefit everyone in society, or that data fully supports
efficiency in the public sector, thus serving the interests
of taxpayers and public security? Both of these latter
arguments have been made by both high-level private
sector (World Economic Forum, 2011) and public-
sector actors (European Commission, 2016). What is
it about the social impacts of digital data that suggests
a social justice agenda is important? For one thing, the
impacts of big data are very different depending on
one's socio-economic position. The work of Gilliom
(2001) and more recently of scholars such as Eubanks
(2014) and Masiero (2016) shows that the greatest
burden of dataveillance (surveillance using digital
methods) has always been borne by the poor.
Bureaucratic systems designed to assure that people
are not misusing state welfare funds and other publicly
funded support are part of the apparatus of govern-
mentality (Lemke, 2001); data-driven law enforcement
focuses unequally on poor neighbourhoods which
experience certain types of criminality (O'Neil, 2016);
and undocumented migrants are tracked and acted
upon by digital systems in more invasive ways than
higher income travellers (Taylor, 2015).
Beyond socio-economic status, gender, ethnicity and
place of origin also help to determine which databases
2 Big Data & Society
we are part of, how those systems use our data and the
kinds of influence they can have over us. Kang's work
on trafficking (2015), for example, shows how the sur-
veillance of women's behaviour and movements by
international anti-trafficking and anti-sex work autho-
rities has historically been shaped by very different
methodologies and types of expertise depending on
subjects' national origin and ethnic group, so that dif-
ferent types of data were fed into the international
system from different regions, with corresponding vari-
ance in the conceptualisation of who should be the sub-
ject of anti-trafficking provisions and of anti-sex-work
programmes for control and discipline. Similarly,
Moore and Currah's (2015) research on how trans-
gender citizens have been dealt with by population
databases in the US shows that one's ability to legally
identify as a different gender depends to a great extent
on one's income. Jiwani's (2015) work on citizenship
and conformity also demonstrates the ways in which
surveillance as an `active social process' reinforces
structural and social boundaries.
Moreover, these problems intersect and multiply at
the boundaries created by the linking and merging of
datasets. This intersectionality (Cho et al., 2013) in the
effects of datafication is an important component of the
argument for a social justice perspective. A range of
interacting characteristics ­ race, ethnicity, religion,
gender, location, nationality, socio-economic status ­
determine how individuals become administrative and
legal subjects through their data and, consequently,
how those data can be used to act upon them by pol-
icymakers, commercial firms and both in combination.
In turn, the possibility of being identified as a target of
surveillance multiplies depending on the number of
categories of interest one belongs to.
For example, a teenager from an immigrant family,
living in a low-income area, whose parents are poor and
who belongs to a minority ethnic group and religion is
exponentially more likely to be targeted for surveillance
by both protective (social services) and preventive at
(law enforcement) authorities, and is also likely to
have less opportunity to resist that surveillance or inter-
vention than her friend who lives in a high-income area
and belongs to the majority ethnic group.
That data systems discriminate is not news. Nor is it
news that they tend to further disadvantage those who
are already marginalised or socially excluded, or that
those people experience the greatest obstacles in seeking
redress. The evidence for this is well documented and
does not per se argue for a new conceptualisation of
data justice ­ everyone has the right to be treated fairly
by public (and private) authorities of all kinds. What
does argue for paying special attention to the current
implications of datafication for social justice, however,
is the particular dynamic of contemporary datafication
where methods of data collection and analysis are no
longer easily divisible into `volunteered' (direct surveys
or other collection of administrative data, where the
citizen is aware her data is being gathered) versus
`other' (digital surveillance via devices and sensors).
For the surveilled teenager in the above example, the
problem multiplies when the functions of data collec-
tion and analysis are shared between public authorities
and the commercial firms that provided her phone, her
internet access or the apps she uses. The economics of
surveillance also have implications for fair representa-
tion and access to services, since access to technology
increasingly determines who can be seen: Shearmur
(2015) has warned that those who use big data to
study behaviour or shape policy are seeing not society
but `users and markets'.
The public­private interface is important because
many of what we perceive as public-sector functions
(counting, categorising and serving our needs as citi-
zens) are in fact performed by the private sector, with
corresponding implications for transparency and
accountability. The number of public-sector data scien-
tists equipped to analyse big data is tiny in comparison
to the number of bureaucrats interested in what big
data can tell them, with the consequence that the data-
fication of government has been, and will always be,
executed primarily by the private sector. For example,
the whistle-blower Edward Snowden was employed by
the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton when he per-
formed surveillance for the US intelligence agencies.
This suggests that markets are a central factor in estab-
lishing and amplifying power asymmetries to do with
digital data, and that new strategies and framings may
be needed that can address the public­private interface
as an important site for determining whether data tech-
nologies serve us or control us.
In response to this problem, arguments are emerging
within different domains for a broader, social-justice-
oriented conceptualisation of our rights with regard to
data. As population data become by-products of infor-
mational capitalism, this has consequences both for the
way we can be monitored and the avenues we have to
seek redress if we are subjected to unfair treatment.
This is because the tools of law and democratic repre-
sentation that provide the possibility of redress where
personal data is misused become more difficult to use as
data starts to flow more freely between commercial and
public sector actors. Responsibility and accountability
grow fuzzy, partly because each actor can shift the
responsibility onto the other, and partly because moni-
toring is indirect and invisible, making people less likely
to identify harms as data related.
The public­private interface involved in large-scale
data collection, and its inevitable engagement with the
global data market, raise fundamental questions about
Taylor 3
how rights can be secured across borders and legal sys-
tems, and even about whether individual rights should
be the only instrument used to combat data harms
(Taylor et al., 2017). One important shift is that the
surveillance (or monitoring) relationship, which under-
pins many other, often positive, functions of data, is no
longer one to one with a fixed aim and geography, but
rather many to many, virtual and has aims that may
shift from governmental to commercial and back again.
A panopticon (Foucault, 1977) where continuous sur-
veillance drives people to modulate their behaviour is
no longer the most useful metaphor for a contemporary
datafied surveillance that is invisible and plural, oper-
ating through a myriad different platforms. Instead of
censoring our behaviour to please our watchers, we
make ourselves accidentally visible through our every-
day behaviour to a huge range of actors, from the cor-
porations that make the devices and systems we use,
and the service providers who facilitate their content,
to the data brokers who track our use of them and the
myriad consumers of their products, which include gov-
ernments, marketing firms, intelligence agencies and
political parties. Even where self-censorship is the aim
of a technological system (as with the Chinese Social
Credit scheme, which is designed to create citizen
behaviour that aligns with governmental priorities
(Creemers, 2016)), it can be argued that it is not realistic
for users to remain constantly in a state of struggle
against an all-encompassing system of surveillance.
Instead, evidence shows that the increasing necessity
of data technologies in everyday life causes people to
resign themselves to this distributed visibility rather
than engaging with it politically (Turow et al., 2015).
Until now, within the global North freedoms and
needs with regard to data technologies have been
approached through a fundamental rights framework
that includes data protection, framings of informa-
tional privacy and the right to free speech and commu-
nication. However, this framing presents two problems
when applied in relation to the global data market.
First, the liberal individual framing of Human Rights
requires that abuses are clear and visible so that those
injured can respond, and second, it assumes that redress
will be sought on the individual level. This is rendered
problematic by the invisible and many-to-many nature
of `seeing' through data technologies, but also by the
fact that many of the negative impacts of data occur on
the group as much as the individual level (Taylor et al.,
2017).
Instead of applying a fundamental rights framework
whose application demands identifiable violations, this
new situation requires a more multifaceted approach
that can address the breadth of actors and possibilities
inherent in contemporary data collection and use. By
identifying the new ways in which power is inscribed in
large-scale digital data, we can better debate what we
want and do not want from the information we emit
about ourselves. The next section will explore two
examples from the public­private interface of datafica-
tion that illustrate the ways in which that interface may
be a locus of structural discrimination (embedded in
institutions, rules and practices) that is also intersec-
tional (multiplying disadvantage to people due to inter-
secting aspects of their identity).
Identifying data injustices
I will explore the problem of data-driven discrimination
using two illustrative cases, both of which demonstrate
that a specific articulation of social justice is now
required with regard to contemporary data technolo-
gies. The first case is that of India's biometric popula-
tion database, known as Aadhaar. The database is the
world's largest with over a billion records and was
launched in 2009 with the stated aim of combating wel-
fare fraud by allowing those below the poverty line to
prove their identity with a fingerprint or iris scan when
collecting entitlements. However, the design of the tech-
nologies that enable inclusion in the system ­ iris and
fingerprint scanners and the networks, wired and
human, that translate inputs of data into outputs of
confirmed identities ­ in fact ensures that the poorest
are the worst served by Aadhaar.
The system's design does not acknowledge the
materiality of poverty, being unable to `authenticate
those who work with stone, cement, limestone and
those over the age of 60' (Yadav, 2016) since they
often have no fingerprints due to hard labour, or
usable iris scans due to malnutrition. It also misses
the day-to-day precarity of poor people's existence by
only allowing each family's single registered claimant to
draw rations, so that if that claimant is sick, working or
otherwise unable to come to the ration provider, the
family cannot access its allocation (Priya and Priya,
2016). Moreover, the backup authentication system
operates by sending a password to the registrant's
mobile phone, thus excluding the poor who cannot
afford a phone, or anyone who has not written down
the number they had when they enrolled (Yadav, 2016).
It also increases the bureaucratic burden of poverty,
since despite compulsory participation there is no way
for people to correct entries in the database on the local
level. There is no independent oversight in terms of
addressing technological faults: the redress system
refers people back to the Unique Identification
Authority of India, the agency that runs Aadhaar,
but there is no legal obligation for the authority to
provide a solution to authentication problems, leaving
them instead to individual citizens and local ration
shops to resolve (Thikkavarapu, 2016). Despite its
4 Big Data & Society
unresponsiveness to registrants, the database does,
however, make it possible for the ultra-poor to be
transformed into consumers: its chairman has said
that he envisages it as having strong potential for
direct marketing to registrants (Nilekani, 2013) and
plans are underway to partner with Google so the
firm can reach and profile its `next billion users'
(Aulakh and Surabhi Agarwal, 2016).
The problem of Aadhaar's uneven burden on the
poor was illustrated by the government's 2016 demon-
etisation, which threw the cash-based elements of
India's economy into chaos, and thus also the lives of
the poor and marginalised. The demonetisation put
demands on automated payment systems in ways that
were discriminatory against the poor, since they had the
least access to mobile phones, formal saving and bank-
ing systems, and applications that could help tide them
over the cash crisis that ensued ­ and suffered the high-
est cost if Aadhaar-related technologies failed to iden-
tify them correctly (Masiero, 2017).
Aadhaar is what Johnson (2014) in his work on
information justice terms a `disciplinary system'. It
raises several issues to do with justice that are specific
to its use of data technologies, specifically the way it
records, stores and processes registrants' data. First, at
the point of collection and processing claims the system
forces registrants to confirm to a `standard of nor-
malcy' (Johnson, 2014) by having legible fingerprints
and irises, by possessing mobile phones, by having a
stable family life where the same registrant can collect
rations from week to week, among other standards.
These standards point to a middle-class standard for
normality rather than the precarity and unpredictabil-
ity of the lives of the poor. Second, it raises problems of
distributive fairness. Although the claim is made that
Aadhaar furthers distributive justice by reducing cor-
ruption in welfare transactions and giving the poor
access to previously inaccessible services and represen-
tation, in fact it offers radically different possibilities
depending on one's resources and socio-economic
status. Third, the system amplifies inequality: for
richer citizens, it is a way to ease one's passage through
the world. One can acquire a phone or a utility account,
prove one's identity in everyday transactions and sim-
plify dealings with the bureaucracy. For poorer citizens,
often lower caste and/or female, it is a way of formalis-
ing precarity. For those whose bodies the system
cannot process, or for those whose identity is misread,
there is no apparent path back to administrative legi-
bility. Finally, it does not allow for fair redress of abuse
or grievances. The complaints procedure is not
designed for emergencies: instead of access to a local
official, problems must be directed by phone or email to
a processing centre with `no timelines, no designated
grievance redress officers, no written dated
acknowledgement receipts, no compensation for the
complainants and no penalties for erring officials'
(Sabhikhi, 2016). Although it is only the poor who
have no choice about whether to use the system, it is
aligned with the bodies and lifestyles of the middle and
upper classes. Meanwhile, there are reports of growing
malnourishment amongst families excluded by the
database (Priya and Priya, 2016).
A second example comes from a system that at the
time of writing was still at the conceptualisation stage,
but which demonstrates how algorithmic uncertainty
(Kwan, 2016) ­ the gap between virtual spatial infor-
mation and physical ground truth ­ can translate into
embedded injustice. A recent proposal by a commercial
firm consulting for the EU Space Agency aimed to
monitor the movements of migrants moving towards
the EU's southern borders.1 Using machine learning
performed on satellite images showing groups as they
prepare to board boats to cross the Mediterranean,
social media output and local online reporting, the
firm proposed to track migrants and predict their
origin and direction of movement. The consultants
planned originally to use migrants' mobile phone
traces, but were dissuaded by the difficulty of obtaining
ongoing datasets, which are tightly guarded by mobile
operators due to privacy concerns (Taylor, 2016c). The
objective of the proposed project was described as being
to enable the visualisation of migrants heading towards
Europe by identifying small groups on individual bea-
ches or hillsides and predicting who would cross which
border and when. The predictions, sold on to border
enforcement and migration authorities, would then
potentially allow those authorities to use algorithmic
sorting to identify `undesirable' migrants and control
the numbers able to make asylum claims by putting in
place measures to prevent them reaching European soil.
This proposal was problematic for several reasons.
First, the machine learning involved would allow the
project to categorise migrants based on behaviour and
characteristics recorded remotely, and second, the
results of that analysis would then be channelled to
institutions who decide whether to allow those migrants
to enter or not. The first aim is risky because it involves
using other attributes as proxies for the targeted behav-
iour or characteristics ­ for example, assuming that
people congregating on a particular beach at a particu-
lar time, or who have been posting certain keywords or
terms on social media, may be planning to migrate and
claim asylum in a particular place. In turn, these
proxies for place of origin and direction of travel are
designed to be used to predict the likelihood that a
group of migrants will have a valid asylum claim.
In reality, however, it is possible to be an undocu-
mented migrant from anywhere on earth and have a
valid claim to asylum. This is because anyone can be
Taylor 5
at risk even in a `safe' environment. For example,
during the US government's attempt to impose a
travel ban on Muslims during 2016, the Canadian gov-
ernment considered whether to declassify even the US
as a safe country for refugees (Kassam, 2017). Citizens
of democratic countries that are not at war may be at
risk due to their sexuality, their gender, their religious
or ethnic group, their political affiliation or any number
of other characteristics. Conditions of risk to individ-
uals are contingent, shifting and nuanced far beyond
what can be predicted by capturing and weighing
proxies for place of origin and migration behaviour.
Such a model, based on the long-discredited idea of
`acting suspiciously', will almost inevitably eventually
be used to produce a yes/no answer that, used on the
group level, determines life or death for individual
migrants.
A system such as this serves to demonstrate how the
possibilities of control through data technologies co-
evolve with the possibilities of care (Lyon, 2007).
Refugees use similar technology to guide their path
into Europe, but in ways that protect their identities
and give them some degree of control over their trajec-
tory. They share their phone GPS details with relatives
and volunteer helpers, use Google Maps to find their
way and social media to decide how to make their jour-
ney (BBC News, 2015; Ram, 2015). When used by
individuals and groups on the ground, the same satel-
lite-based GPS and mapping technologies that can be
used by border agencies to control and erase migration
also help migrants to preserve autonomy, human secur-
ity and their right to flee danger.
There is a strong incentive for commercial analysts,
in this case, to stress the accuracy of their automated
predictions, since this raises their value for public-
sector buyers. A `good usable system', as Bowker and
Star (1999: 33) have observed, becomes so convenient
that it disappears and only its answers can be seen. In
the context of large-scale remote surveillance for policy
purposes, the likelihood that those answers will be
tested for accuracy is diminished. O'Neil (2016) has
warned that algorithmic models must be constantly
recalibrated using feedback from the events they are
supposed to predict. Yet it is hard to see how a
model that uses remote surveillance to predict the
aims and origins of undocumented migrants will also
incorporate correct data on those migrants' actual
outcomes.
The likely inaccuracy of such a system notwithstand-
ing, this leads us to the larger problem: that rights that
are supposed to be fundamental ­ including the rights
to privacy and autonomy, to effective remedy for
harms, and many others relating to the uses of data
in a migration-prediction system ­ are in fact not trea-
ted as fundamental because they do not extend across
borders. The problem of migrant rights goes far beyond
data, but data systems underpin the way migrants can
be included and excluded, and therefore their ability to
claim their rights (Broeders, 2009). Data systems that
are transnational in nature demand rights and redress
mechanisms that are similarly transnational, yet this is
currently an impossibility in the case of remote sensing,
remote analytics and remote decision making. Someone
who is remotely surveilled will not know the basis on
which they are being categorised, and in any case those
who are territorially excluded as a result will not be able
to appeal the decision. Yet if the functioning of
national law and sovereignty mean that a person has
certain fundamental rights when standing on one side
of the EU's border but not on the other, this is deeply
problematic in ways that cannot be solved by claims
about the necessity of sovereignty (Brock, 2009). Data
justice joins a class of complex multidimensional prob-
lems such as climate justice, terrorism and poverty that
have been classed as `super-wicked' (Levin et al., 2012),
and which it is necessary to address in a systemic way in
order to deal with their interdependencies.
Data justice across domains
and systems
There are currently (at least) three main approaches to
conceptualising data justice: one addressing the ways in
which data used for governance can support power
asymmetries (Johnson, 2014), another focusing on the
ways in which data technologies can provide greater
distributive justice through making the poor visible
(Heeks and Renken, 2016) and another that is inter-
ested in how practices of dataveillance can impact on
the work of social justice organisations (Dencik et al.,
2016). Although these different strands of research
apparently point in different directions, I will argue
that there is value in bringing them together.
Johnson (2014) connects data justice primarily to
open data. He writes of the need for `subsuming the
question of open data within a larger question of infor-
mation justice', but goes on to offer conclusions that
have relevance for data as a tool of governance (and
governmentality) more broadly. He advocates for
establishing a concept of `information justice' that can
counteract the ways in which administrative data inev-
itably embeds social privilege and creates an unequal
set of opportunities due to the differential capabilities
of citizen versus commercial users. He argues that data
systems tend to have a disciplinary function because the
way data are collected and structured constitutes a
form of normative coercion (one example of this is
the problem encountered by transgender people seeking
to change their birth registration as cited above). As a
way to address the problem, Johnson (2016: 29)
6 Big Data & Society
advocates for `mak[ing] politics explicit' with regard to
data technologies, through collaborative research invol-
ving philosophers of technology, information scientists
and social scientists.
Second, Heeks and Renken (2016) provide a rich
analysis of the possible framings of data justice from
the perspective and with the priorities of the inter-
national development sector, taking the question of
information justice to an explicitly global level and
asking how it should be purposed when applied to
questions of human development. The paper begins
from the notion that the Sustainable Development
Goals forefront both `data' and `justice', and that there-
fore the development field must engage with them as
intersecting concepts for the first time. The authors
argue for a structural approach that does not limit
itself to the functions of data in the sector, but instead
is framed with reference to `wider codes of social
and political justice' (p. 5). They use the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UN General
Assembly, 1948) to argue that the rights to data own-
ership, access and representation are fundamental to
fairness and justice. The paper argues for a networked
perspective, seeing data systems as connectors on the
local and global levels where competing interests are
inevitably at play.
Finally, Dencik et al. (2016) identify a need to con-
ceptualise data justice due to the way that surveillance
capitalism constrains citizenship and activism. They
therefore argue for the introduction of `data justice'
terminology to describe resistance to government sur-
veillance based on principles of social justice. Their idea
of data justice pays attention to the way in which
choices about data systems, contractors and targets
inscribe particular kinds of power and interest. In
their framing, data justice is a concept that can help
create collaboration between anti-surveillance and
social justice activism, driving the first to articulate
broader concerns of rights and freedoms and the
latter to engage with the technical dimensions of sur-
veillance and resistance. Their framing focuses specific-
ally on social activism, but connects both to Johnson's
call to explore the politics of datafication and to Heeks
and Renken's attention to the political economy of
datafication: `Referring to ``data justice'' recognises
the political economy of the system that underpins
the possibilities for extensive surveillance, whilst draw-
ing attention to the political agenda that is driving its
implementation' (Dencik et al., 2016: 10).
These three contrasting interpretations of the idea of
data justice are linked through their focus on politics
and power, and by their formulation of social justice.
The differences between their conceptualisations,
however, are useful because they raise some essential
questions.
First, how can a conceptualisation of data justice on
the global scale call on important fundamentals such as
rights, justice and fairness without becoming relativis-
tic? Heeks and Renken (2016: 7) note that each region
or country will judge what is just according to its own
conceptualisation based on its own tradition and his-
tory, and that they therefore seek `to move right away
from interpretive, bottom-up notions' to wider codes
such as the UDHR.
How is it possible, though, to formulate principles of
data justice without allowing them to be shaped by the
global community of data producers? A vision of data
justice that takes power and politics into account must
necessarily also be rooted in local experience. If coun-
tries have differing aims with regard to the potential of
digital data, and different ideas of what constitutes its
misuse, how should they contribute to the framing of
what is just? For example, the argument has been made
the subjects of development effectively have a duty of
visibility to the authorities working to combat poverty
(Taylor, 2016c). Robert Kirkpatrick of the UN's
Global Pulse data science initiative has said of
developing-country citizens that `privacy is your right.
So is access to food, water, humanitarian response. The
challenge is that we see a lot of regulatory frameworks
which don't have the right litmus test'.2 His statement
implies that development agencies have a claim to peo-
ple's data on a utilitarian basis, and that opting out
should not be an option because it will impact on the
rights of the collective.
Up to this point, I have used the words `rights' and
`freedoms' to denote the concepts that seem essential as
metrics for the just use of data technologies. The
Global Pulse example, however, indicates the need for
a relational approach (as opposed to a relativistic one)
that can integrate rights and needs into a single frame-
work rather than demand a purely utilitarian choice
between them. In fact the language of rights may not
be the right tool with which to seek to define a global
framing of justice. Brock (2009) argues in her cosmo-
politan account of global justice that asking what peo-
ple's needs are, rather than what rights they may claim,
makes it possible to think across cultural and regional
framings of justice. The liberal individual notion of
rights is not adopted by many societies which neverthe-
less have a strong philosophical and legal tradition of
justice and fairness (Panikkar, 1982). Many states and
regions, for example, take a perspective on rights that
frames them as inseparable from corresponding duties,
and also addresses the individual as part of the larger
collective (Sen, 2005).
Datafication is frequently a territory for both the
formalisation and the negotiation of rights. For exam-
ple, in the case of many African states Makulilo (2016)
posits that with the arrival of the digital era, the
Taylor 7
growing data economy is placing the notion of ubuntu
(humanity towards the collective) into a complex inter-
action with that of privacy. Arguing that it is possible
to find certain freedoms identified as important across
different societies in the region regardless of their for-
malisation as human rights, Makulilo quotes the
Nigerian scholar Nwauche, who states that despite
the lack of a formal right to it, `privacy is important
in Nigeria because there are human beings'. On this
basis, it may be more useful to think in terms of basic
needs with regard to data that may be formalised dif-
ferently in different places.
Also mitigating against the use of a framework based
on individual rights to shape data justice is the fact that
data injustice increasingly tends to occur on the collect-
ive level. New data technologies tend to sort, profile and
inform action based on group rather than individual
characteristics and behaviour (Taylor et al., 2017), so
that in order to operationalise any concept of data just-
ice, it is inevitably going to be necessary to look beyond
the individual level. Some legal systems have already
formalised this relationship between surveillance and
the collective: Mexican law, for example, envisages this
collective level with regard to informational privacy by
including the family in the sphere of the individual with
regard to data protection (Tribunales Colegiados del
Circuito, 2015). Sen (2005), whose work is central to
Heeks and Renken's exploration of data justice, balances
the individual and collective when he notes that social
justice cannot occur in a vacuum but requires collective
action to be realised. The structural approach is key
here: if we consider the necessity for the formal estab-
lishment of what is fair (process freedoms) and for the
need for agency (opportunity freedoms) (Sen 2005), data
justice seems to fit best with a broader capabilities per-
spective that can encompass variation in how fairness
should be determined and whether justice can be
realised.
A second issue that arises from the three framings
quoted above is the issue of what data justice should
aim to achieve. The three visions focus in very different
directions: Johnson asks how database design can better
incorporate anti-discrimination principles; Heeks and
Renken focus mainly on the question of how data
should be distributed in order to achieve fairer access,
participation and representation. Dencik et al., mean-
while, are concerned with the conditions under which
data should not be distributed (via surveillance), in
order to protect the work of activists working towards
social justice. A further, contrasting perspective can be
found in the work of Mann (2016), who argues that it is
also important who gets to process the economic benefits
of the data economy, and that to promote social justice
in relation to digital data, we should seek to embed prin-
ciples of justice in the way data markets are structured.
Are these perspectives contrasting or incompatible?
Do we need separate frameworks for developing better
defences against discrimination, exercising the right to
be counted and resisting surveillance, or is it more
useful to find an overarching argument about data just-
ice that can incorporate these principles and, by doing
so, contribute more than addressing them separately?
In the next section I will argue for such an overarching
framework in order to reconcile these aims, each of
which promotes a different but essential freedom with
regard to data.
A proposed framework for data justice
A framework that could reconcile the differing perspec-
tives discussed above would have to do several things.
First, it would have to take into account the novelty
and complexity of the ways in which (big) data systems
can discriminate, discipline and control, as demon-
strated in the examples of Aadhaar and the migration
monitoring system. Second, it would have to offer a
framing which could take into account both the posi-
tive and negative potential of the new data technologies
­ their ability to facilitate what Nussbaum and Sen
(1993) term `human flourishing', which forms the over-
all aim of human development ­ and also their poten-
tial to hinder it. Finally, it would have to do this using
principles that were useful across social contexts, and
thus remedy the developing double standard with
regard to privacy and the value of visibility in lower
versus higher income countries, as illustrated by
Global Pulse's utilitarian balancing of privacy with
other needs.
A framework is necessary, then, that can take into
account the need to be represented but also the possi-
bility of the need to opt out of data collection or pro-
cessing, the need to preserve one's autonomy with
regard to data-producing technologies and the need
to be protected from and to challenge data-driven dis-
crimination. This suggests an approach based on three
pillars: visibility, digital (dis)engagement and counter-
ing data-driven discrimination (see Figure 1), but which
does more than set out what rights are necessary. It
must also provide for a methodological engagement
with the political economy of data, in order to deter-
mine not only what, but who is important and how they
relate to the desired outcomes.
As Figure 1 shows, the elements of data justice
hypothesised here are purposely broader than available
international frameworks such as the Fair Information
Practice Principles which form the basis for informa-
tional rights in many OECD countries, or the right to
privacy as set out in the various human rights instru-
ments. These frameworks are valuable and often effect-
ive, but they aim at the problem on a practical rather
8 Big Data & Society
than conceptual level. Rather than staking out the
boundaries of what should or should not be done
with data, the elements of data justice proposed here
represent a way to think about data at a level that goes
beyond particular domains and applications, and
instead to address data technologies primarily as they
relate to human needs.
The first pillar, visibility, deals both with privacy and
representation. Here common threads of reasoning can be
drawn from the fields of international development stu-
dies, human geography and legal scholarship. A more
detailed framing of the needs for both visibility and infor-
mational privacy should take into account the work being
done on privacy at the social margins (Arora, 2016;
Gilliom, 2001; Jayaram, 2014), the risks to group privacy
through collective profiling (Taylor, 2016b; Floridi, 2014;
Raymond, 2016) and the extent to which data may be
considered a public good (Taylor, 2016d).
Engagement with technology is the second pillar of
this putative conceptual framework. Although ICT-for-
Development ­ the promotion of engagement with digi-
tal technologies in LMICs ­ has clearly established
links between fostering human development and pro-
viding access to ICTs (Heeks, 2010; Unwin, 2009), this
field is adjusting, like others, to the evolution of new
data-producing technologies and analytics and is now
starting to critically address the freedom not to use par-
ticular technologies, and in particular not to become
part of commercial databases as a by-product of devel-
opment interventions (Taylor & Broeders, 2015;
Gagliardone, 2014). The freedom to control the terms
of one's engagement with data markets is an essential
component of any data justice framework because it
underpins the power to understand and determine
one's own visibility. Arguments for the importance of
people's autonomy with regard to technology can be
found in postcolonial theory, since the way in which
data is processed and analysed within national and
global data markets positions individuals as subalterns
(Spivak, 1988) in relation to those who process their
data. They are unable to define for themselves how
their data are used, to whom they are resold or the
kinds of profiles and interventions those data can
enable. On this basis Mann (2016) argues that address-
ing data for economic development, rather than just data
for development per se, focuses attention on the poten-
tial benefits to low-income people of collecting and ana-
lysing data independently of large technology firms,
and on how data's returns can be captured and pro-
cessed at the local level.
The third pillar within this proposed framework is
nondiscrimination. It is composed of two dimensions:
the power to identify and challenge bias in data use,
and the freedom not to be discriminated against.
People's ability to identify and challenge bias in data-
driven decision making is expected to diminish as the
complexity of data's production and processing
increase (Kroll et al., 2016). As neural networks and
deep learning become more commonplace, the ability
of even system designers themselves to understand how
bias may be embedded in data processing is diminish-
ing. This implies that methods have to be devised that
can allow for the governance of algorithmic processes
and decision making, and that the responsibility for
challenging discrimination on the part of individuals
will need to be accompanied by the ability to identify
and create penalties for it on the part of government
(Kroll et al., 2016).

Part of the contribution of the proposed conceptual
framework for data justice is to help frame the neces-
sary questions as well as to point the way to answers.
As in the periodic table, any mapping of relationships
and positions also maps out missing elements. For
example, the freedom not to engage with the data
market or not to be represented in commercial databases
has not yet been adequately theorised: even privacy
studies assume that such engagement is inevitable.
Yet there are historical and contemporary indications
that such freedoms are necessary: From the 19th-cen-
tury Luddite protestors who developed a new politics of
workers' rights and resistance in the context of new
industrial technologies (Binfield, 2015) to the anti-
census activists of the 1970s and 1980s in the
Netherlands and Germany (Hannah, 2010; Holvast,
2013), there has been a debate about where technology
that can count and monitor fits within the social contract
and how much visibility citizens owe the state.
This debate underlies both Heeks and Renken's and
Johnson's formulations: the right to be seen and repre-
sented is central to data justice, but so is the right to
withdraw from the database, whether it is held by the
state, commercial firms or both as in the case of
Aadhaar.
Perhaps the central question raised by the concept of
data justice set out here is how to balance and integrate
the need to be seen and represented appropriately with
the needs for autonomy and integrity. What are the
implications of letting people opt out of data collection?
Should people, for example, be able to opt out of com-
mercial databases if those databases are likely to be
used by the state to supplement or replace administra-
tive or survey data? What are good governance prin-
ciples for the use of big data in a democratic context,
and who should be responsible for determining them?
Census-taking is both one of the most invasive
moments in the relationship between individual and
state, and one of the most important rights of a citizen
in a democratic society. If state population data is soon
to be at least partly composed of commercially col-
lected data (Keeter, 2012) and updated in real time,
and those data can tell the government not only con-
ventional facts about the population but instead almost
everything, where does legitimate observation end and
illegitimate surveillance begin?
An ecosystemic approach based
on capabilities
As Heeks and Renken suggest, Sen (1999) and
Nussbaum's (2006) capabilities and freedoms-based
approach offer one avenue to integrating the principles
of data justice into an operationalisable framework, as
does Kleine's (2011) Choice Framework for
conceptualising the opportunities provided by technol-
ogy in a development context. The Capabilities
Approach encompasses both what Sen terms opportun-
ity freedoms, described by Alkire (2011) as one's real
opportunity to achieve the functionings one values, and
what he terms process freedoms, which denote agency ­
one's ability to act on behalf of what matters (Alkire
2011). In line with the focus of data justice on prevent-
ing marginalisation and promoting a socially just model
for handling data, the approach begins not from a con-
sideration of the average person, but asks instead what
kind of organising principles for justice can address the
marginalised and vulnerable to the same extent as
everyone else (see Figure 2).
The diagram demonstrates how data justice can fit
within the Capabilities Approach as an overarching
conceptual framework within which research and
debate can identify what freedoms people value with
regard to data technologies, and how to realise them.
It is positioned within the structure of opportunity free-
doms and process freedoms that determine what peo-
ple's functionings (`doings' or `beings') can be with
regard to data technologies. In turn, these functionings
can be translated via social conversion factors such as
political, legal and educational support into capabilities
such as participation in data value chains, access to
data affecting oneself (e.g., through laws on freedom
of information or via sectoral data access facilities)
and inclusion in decision making about what technolo-
gies are used in particular contexts.
If we follow Sen's advice to engage with the domain
of public reasoning to determine what people want
from data technologies, this also leads us to consider
his overall argument for a Capabilities framing: that it
helps people to decide what functionings they value,
and what capabilities they wish to prioritise. The task
of a conceptual framework for data justice, then,
becomes to build on this approach to understand
what constitute the common principles that might
help operationalise it. Such principles are necessary
with regard to the global nature of the data market,
since national legislation has difficulty targeting pro-
cesses that take place transnationally, as is the case
with, for example, data brokers and large online service
providers such as Google and Facebook.
The task of building out and thinking about opera-
tionalising this kind of data justice framework therefore
requires a different theoretical and methodological
toolkit from, for instance, research on informational
privacy. This fits with a current trend where scholars
worldwide are calling for change in terms of the way
data's social impacts are researched (Cohen, 2012;
Dalton et al., 2016; Floridi, 2016; Kleine, 2010;
Schwartz and Solove, 2011). Cohen (2012), in particu-
lar, has argued for a socially situated and
10 Big Data & Society
interdisciplinary analysis of information, power and
privacy that can create new organising notions for
human flourishing relevant to the rise of the `networked
self'. Such research would need to take a global ecosys-
temic approach that could look across borders. It
would offer the possibility of bridging among different
levels of engagement with technology and different con-
cepts of technology-related development, and between
different moral and philosophical systems. One import-
ant tool in this process would be the emerging field of
Critical Data Studies, and that of digital geographies
more broadly, which have shown that the knowledge
necessary to establish a more socially just approach to
the use of digital data already exists, but that it tends
not to be incorporated into policy, law or practice at
the level necessary to be usable (Dalton et al., 2016).
Connecting this knowledge to policy and law, and par-
ticularly to the transnational political responsibilities of
online service providers (Taylor et al., 2017) would
inevitably be part of the work of operationalising
data justice, just as it is with social justice movements
more broadly.
The questions raised by the framing of data justice
presented here operate both at the highest level ­ where
the social contract is shaped and negotiated ­ and at the
most basic, in the practices of everyday digital life.
These, as Heeks and Renken point out, will differ
across societies and regions. Therefore, the main chal-
lenge in building out this conceptualisation will be in
finding how these overarching principles can gain trac-
tion in different contexts: some countries or groups
will identify benefits of surveillance while others will
strongly react against it as oppressive. Some will
assert that private sector innovation plays a central
role in realising the benefits of data science while
others will claim that making the public sector more
responsible for controlling data will achieve more just
results. The conceptual core would need to be trans-
lated and negotiated across contexts just as its compo-
nents already have been (e.g., data protection or
research ethics). Ideas such as justice, equality and non-
discrimination inform regimes as varied as taxation and
market regulation, so that data justice would need to
operate as another branch of these core governance
principles. Rather than being centralised however (the
`centre' inevitably being a high-income, high-technol-
ogy location), these translations and negotiations
would instead have to occur on a distributed basis
within what Sen (2005) has termed `the domain of
public reasoning'. Under such a premise, each legal
and social system would work out for itself how the
principles of data justice applied. This is important
because the principles set out here are at odds, in one
way or another, with every established regime of data
governance on earth (e.g. the right not to be recorded in
databases), and will meet different challenges depend-
ing on the location of the discussion.
Conclusion
The conceptualisation of data justice presented above
poses a challenge to most existing frameworks for gov-
erning data. It does so because it incorporates the
assumption that any framing that does not incorporate
both the beneficial and negative aspects of data tech-
nologies cannot gain traction in the domain of public
Figure 2. A capabilities approach to data justice.

reasoning. The frameworks we currently use either
emphasises risk and harm, or argue for making data
and the power to analyse them as broadly accessible
as possible. The task of reconciling these perspectives
is politically and theoretically huge. A framework that
aims to reconcile datafied visibility with invisibility and
technological engagement with nonengagement will
challenge many accepted norms, notably in the areas
of promoting innovation and economic development
and the established right of the state to count and inter-
vene upon its citizens. The principles set out here are
not obstacles to innovation, nor should they constitute
a hindrance to democratic processes of government.
Nevertheless, they pose difficult questions that require
significant reconciliation of different values. It is
important to pose these questions because they aim at
the changing interfaces between the individual and the
state, between the commercial and public sectors and
between science and the public, and they mark out the
uncomfortable territory where friction is taking place
around privacy, responsibility and accountability.
These places of friction deserve our attention. They
are the places where we are negotiating both the evo-
lution of governance and of how we wish to live along-
side each other in knowledge societies. Change should
not take place at these intersections without our noti-
cing, nor should we brush it off as inevitable.
Innovation and evolution in technology are constant
and desirable, but the ways in which technologies are
used to monitor and govern us are negotiable. We
should be able to determine our interactions with tech-
nology by debating and, if necessary, resisting and pro-
posing different paths. If we cannot imagine how to
regain the kind of privacy we would like, how to
allow people to opt out of being surveilled through
their data ­ or even of producing those data in the
first place ­ we may have to reinvent as well as
renegotiate.
This may also involve making different demands of
authorities ­ whether commercial or governmental ­
with regard to the governance of, and through, data
technologies. Operationalising the framework proposed
here would entail a shift from making individuals
responsible for understanding the data market to
making national and international authorities account-
able for data governance. It would also demand that we
distinguish between responsible data use ­ the current
buzzword in the fields of data governance and innov-
ation policy ­ and accountable data use, something
much more difficult to achieve because it demands
structural change rather than allowing our guardians
to guard themselves.
The various framings of data justice proposed since
the advent of big data indicate that around the world,
scholars and policymakers are attempting to reconcile
principles of social justice with the reality of datafica-
tion. Their contributions range from the grand scale of
the Onlife Manifesto to the specificity of Greenfield's
Against the Smart City (2013). The next challenge is to
integrate these worldwide perspectives and principles
into a broader vision that can address the globalisation
of data technologies and its impacts. The framework set
out here is one response to the challenge of making
sense of life in datafied societies. It aims to offer a road-
map towards further analysis, the specification of par-
ticular aims and objectives, and eventually
operationalisation within multiple and differing
national and international contexts.
