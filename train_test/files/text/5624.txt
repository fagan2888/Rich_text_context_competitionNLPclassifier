Introduction
In his book The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power,
Yergin (2009) offers a masterly analysis of the immense influ-
ence that the economics of oil had on the 20th century. Oil
became deeply intertwined with national strategies and global
politics and power. To a large extent, national economies of the
20th century can be viewed as oil economies.
The onset of the 21st century is marked by a rapid transi-
tion of the global economy toward a knowledge economy,
creating knowledge societies (United Nations Educational,
Scientific, and Cultural Organization [UNESCO], 2005).
The 21st century is also widely regarded as the century of
biology (F. J. Ayala, 2007; Kafatos & Eisner, 2004). Major
investments in education and science by Qatar (Clark,
2013), United Arab Emirates (Ahmed & Abdalla Alfaki,
2013), and other petroleum-rich countries striving to diver-
sify their economies away from oil herald this trend. Novel
tools such as the National Knowledge Assessment (National
Research Council, 1996, 1999) have emerged to assist
developing countries and other jurisdictions to analyze their
capabilities for participating in the knowledge revolution. A
restructuring of the innovation process is underway around
the globe: New national and regional centers of relevant
research are emerging and, as a result, global interactions
and knowledge sharing are accelerating, diversifying, and
deepening (Ernst & Hart, 2008).
In their widely cited article, Powell and Snellman (2004)
define the knowledge economy as "production and services
based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an
accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance, as well
as rapid obsolescence" (p. 199). While the descriptions of a
knowledge-based economy continue to evolve, they converge
in their core emphasis on the use of information resources
(technologies, skills, and processes) to achieve and accelerate
economicgrowthpotential.AreportbytheAsianDevelopment
Bank (2014) extols this emphasis as an unprecedented oppor-
tunity for developing economies to step up competitiveness
and move up in global value by leapfrogging certain technol-
ogy cycles and catching up with the latest advances, such as
moving to cloud computing solutions. Reflecting on its global

The Economic Might of Earth's Evolution:
The Epic Promise of Knowledge
Hana Ayala1
Abstract
The article presents original economic and business models that, in their interplay, have the capacity to shepherd the
sustainability and conservation legacy of the emerging global knowledge economy. These models are framed by an assertion
that our planet holds a vast reserve that could define the 21st century as profoundly as oil has shaped the 20th century.
They are premised on a comparison: Unlike oil or mineral ores whose global volume is just a sum of their deposits across
the world, the 21st-century reserve--the yet-to-be-tapped scientific knowledge embedded in biologically opulent landscapes
and seascapes--grows in volume and worth in the context of evolutionary, ecological, and other relationships that transcend
regions and political borders. They are grounded in legacy-investment opportunities whose competitiveness and prestige grow
along with the geographical footprint of the research they underwrite. While various stages of these models' conceptualization
and validation have been published in scholarly journals and enriched with endorsements by several members and officers of
the United States National Academy of Sciences and by heads of state and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization) leaders, this article is the first comprehensive presentation of both. It pioneers their integration
into a catalyst of a new economic geography. It charts a paradigm of "noble wealth," not intended to replace oil wealth but
to outperform it in endurance and lasting benefit to humanity.

dimension, Facebook's founder Mark Zuckerberg has lauded
the knowledge economy for supporting a larger economic
shift in the world based on information and ideas (Kelleher,
2013).
But is there a raw material that has the potential to propel
and structure this new economy, just as oil shaped the indus-
trial economy?
There is. I have argued that our planet holds a vast reserve
that could define the 21st century--a reserve that ought to be
mobilized and nurtured with the same vigor as are research
parks, scientific cities, and knowledge-based industries in
building viable and sustainable knowledge economies.
This reserve is embedded in the still largely unspoiled
landscapes and seascapes of our planet, involving such fea-
tures as rain forests, coral reefs, and other spectacularly bio-
diverse habitats and harboring geologic history rich in fossil
records. These extraordinary natural environments, most
opulent in the world's tropics and within the borders of
developing countries, are treasuries of potential scientific
knowledge. I view these natural assets as prime repositories
of the knowledge mineral, the raw material for the knowl-
edge economy. My basic claim is that countries abounding in
biodiversity and other natural riches of scientific importance
could achieve influence and wealth comparable in magni-
tude--and incomparably superior in endurance--with those
that oil-rich countries have traditionally enjoyed.
This dramatic redefinition of the geography of wealth is
conditioned on strategies that disregard national borders. A
comparison between the geography of the knowledge min-
eral and the geography of oil reveals a striking difference.
Whether we look at the global, regional, or national distribu-
tion of oil reserves, the overall amount of oil is no more than
the sum of these reserves. Connecting two or more reserves
does not increase the volume and quality of the oil contained
in these reserves. In contrast, the knowledge-mineral resource
can be fully assessed and valued only in the context of evo-
lutionary, ecological, and other relationships that have and
continue to distribute natural capital across geographies and
political boundaries. These relationships--of conservation
and scientific value--complement and enhance the knowl-
edge content and worth of the individual natural heritage
assets they conjoin.
Hence, I assert, the value of natural resources does not
diminish in the knowledge economy; it may well increase,
measured in terms of "knowledge content" and developed on
scales that shift the emphasis to layers of knowledge min-
eral--knowledge veins--sculpted by correlations and rela-
tionships among multiple reservoirs of these resources.
The critical question becomes, "How are we to ignite and
sustain the potential of the natural resource-based knowledge
stock as a source of wealth, one not meant to replace oil
wealth but to outperform it in lasting benefit to humanity?"
The answer I propose might, at first, seem surprising, even
startling: The international resort industry and resort-styled
private estates, predisposed toward locations of outstanding
natural beauty and interest, are superbly positioned to become
the principal business partner in this scientific consolidation
of vast stores of new knowledge. Thus, while tourism-based
economies and knowledge economies, viewed in conven-
tional terms, seem to involve two dramatically different sce-
narios of economic development, I argue that they can be
combined to yield a major new economic model because they
share a resource base of critical importance to their strength
and growth potential--yet under threat and gradually disap-
pearing throughout the world.
The Vision, Proofs, and Guarantees: A Paradigm
in Progress
The goal of this article is to consolidate the aforementioned
positions by bridging a retrospective of their genesis and
validation with the unfolding perspective of their translation
into transnational sustainable-development strategies. Thus,
a collective mission with the capacity to strengthen the role
of science in international policy making and diplomacy is
created along with the ability to engender legacy opportuni-
ties that invite both financial and intellectual investment that
will produce major returns for humanity for generations to
come. This goal defines the article's structure.
A prelude, "Nature and Knowledge: An Economic
Frontier," is a reflection on the existing interpretations and
valuations of the relationship between natural resources and
the knowledge economy. The original work presented in this
article starts with the Retrospective that is divided into two
sections and related to some of the latest market trends and
advancements in the evolutionary sciences.
The first section, titled "The Economic Geography of
Wonder," revolves around insights I have charted into the
untapped economic and social relevance of the dynamics and
relationships that pervade the natural world within and across
national jurisdictions. I demonstrate how these insights, and
the development blueprints I devised around them, have bol-
stered national pride about natural wealth enclosed within a
country's borders, increased the stature of science in the eyes
and acts of political leaders, and laid foundations for science-
fueled and conservation-benefiting economic collaborations
on regional and trans-regional scales.
The second section, "Business Model With a Mission,"
summarizes a complementary, multiyear effort I have carried
out to devise and test an investment platform that redefines the
worth, stature, and appreciation potential of properties located
across the world's most naturally privileged locations--loca-
tions that are now entering the market greatly undervalued by
being reduced to just prime real estate. This platform unlocks
the potential of these properties to excel as highly privileged
staging areas for a new breed of resort facilities catering to
world travelers and invited to invest in scientific discoveries
along far-reaching stretches of the earth's natural fabric on the
premise of major business returns (including the capacity to
offer unique, ever-changing experiences that are immune to
Ayala 3
imitation and possess the ability to command ever-greater
competitive strength and prestige). Importantly, these business
returns are not conditioned on the investors' ownership of the
unlocked knowledge as intellectual property and can be cou-
pled with formidable legacy rewards if backed by assurances
that the underwritten knowledge harvests will benefit the
nations harboring the natural cradles of these harvests as well
as the local communities as custodians of these cradles and as
partners strengthened through conservation- and research-spe-
cific training and employment. These lofty goals converge in
an ideal partnership, but there is nothing idealistic about their
content. They are backed with a well-grounded business per-
spective for a powerful industry that will increasingly be
driven by travelers' thirst for knowledge and has the potential
to become the strongest conservation force in the world.
A paramount goal behind the synergistic efforts discussed
in these two sections has been to empower conservation with
economic foundations that guard against reducing nature to a
commodity and that honor and value knowledge advanced
through basic scientific research as public good. This goal--
and the Retrospective--extend into the Perspective unveiled
by this article and also subdivided into two highly synergistic
sections.
The Perspective's first section, titled "Wealth Infrastructure
Attuned to Nature," introduces a pilot transnational project,
The Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth (PBNW). The project's
purpose is to engender and shepherd a sustainable multina-
tional economy structured as innovative knowledge bridges
that empower science diplomacy as the engine of the new
economy's governance while guarding its precious stock of
natural riches. The design of this megaproject revolves around
building a knowledge supra structure that discloses and har-
nesses the collective scientific importance of the connections
and dynamics that distinguish the Pacific Island Region's
spectacularly diverse natural heritage and that expand further
in their collective worth along affinities that tie islands and
ecosystems of the Pacific coast of the Americas with those
along the ocean-linked biological networks of the larger Indo-
Pacific Region. This consolidation of a grand knowledge
bank is intended to inspire an extension of the World Heritage
recognition to relationships and processes that span multiple
natural sites or regions and are of exceptional scientific value
and to form a novel economic block with the formidable
capacity to generate discoveries that will fuel major advances
in science, medicine, and other fields of value to humanity.
The business model whose evolution is chronicled in this
article's Retrospective enters the PBNW design on the prem-
ise of utmost selectivity: selectivity in terms of the magni-
tude of the environmental and social benefit that each
investment will spur and, deservingly, will capitalize on by
acquiring limitless potential to appreciate in stature, market
worth, and legacy rewards. This model is employed to yield
a portfolio of legacy investments in hospitality­science part-
nerships that is master-planned to function as a self-sustain-
ing system through which research funding and expertise
flow into the most precious reservoirs of this planet's heri-
tage, injecting economic justification into their protection
and converting the guardianship of humankind's most irre-
placeable possessions into a vibrant job market that benefits
the neediest. A top priority is to use this system to ignite a
shift from the traditional development scenario of "tourism
for tourism-economy" to a new-generation alternative, "tour-
ism for knowledge-economy" that is a trail-blazer in terms of
international competitiveness and environmental sustainabil-
ity with widely shared benefits. The endorsements and sup-
port that this pilot project has already received from leaders
of several Pacific Island nations, UNESCO, and the
University of the South Pacific, and the project's inaugura-
tion at the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center of the United
States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and
Medicine--the West Coast Headquarters of the National
Academies--have laid the ground for an unprecedented sus-
tainable-development teamwork.
"Turning a Vision Into a Sustainability Partnership," the
Perspective's second section, reveals a strategy to reinforce
this teamwork's promise and endurance and to stimulate its
outgrowth into a global opportunity. Novel environmental,
legal, business, and other aspects and their interface will
define the implementation of the PBNW--and of my entire
mission and aspiration to help chart a new geography, diplo-
macy, and legacy for the knowledge economy. Equipping all
these efforts with perpetual assurances of academic preemi-
nence and receptivity to new opportunities became impera-
tive. Acting on behalf of the Pangea World organization I
founded, I have been honored to initiate a strategic alliance
with the University of California (UC), anchored by UC
Irvine and fortified in its potency by the presence of the West
Coast Headquarters of the National Academies adjacent to
the campus. This nascent alliance has the capacity--and the
opportunity--to ensure that knowledge derived from natural
resources in a particular country is shared with and benefits
that country, while the knowledge yielded by research
insights into transnational threads of the earth's evolutionary
and ecological fabric is treated as a global asset that benefits
all of humanity. I convey my commitment to this opportunity
with a tribute to the late Ralph Cicerone, former National
Academy of Sciences President and UC Irvine Chancellor,
whose advice and encouragement have greatly enriched the
Pangea World journey since its formative stages.
Nature and Knowledge: An Economic
Frontier
The relationship between natural resources and the knowl-
edge economy has, thus far, been largely a function of
improvements in exploration and extraction techniques vis-
à-vis the stock of economically useful oil or mineral reserves
or productive land. A 2002 World Bank study well defines
this relationship and offers numerous supporting examples
(deFerranti,Perry,Lederman,&Maloney,2002).Application
4 SAGE Open
of knowledge can even create new natural resources, as dem-
onstrated by Norway's accomplishment in transforming
waterfalls into hydropower (Ville & Wicken, 2015).
Brazil deserves a special look, for it challenges the contin-
ued perception of knowledge economies and natural resource
economies as being at two ends of a continuum of economic
development. Bound (2008) deems Brazil a natural knowl-
edge-economy on the premise that Brazil's bounty of natural
resources, assets, and endowments is a key area of opportu-
nity for science and innovation. She observes that Brazil's
competitive advantage as a natural knowledge economy
gains vigor and momentum as climate change, the environ-
ment, food scarcity, and rising worldwide energy demand are
moving to the forefront of global consciousness. While in
large part physically enclosed within Brazil's national bor-
ders, the Amazon rain forest ecosystem is boundless as a cru-
cial factor in the global climate equilibrium. Similarly, the
Amazon's biodiversity is of irreplaceable value to all of
humanity as one of the most significant resources for the
active ingredients for new medicines and cures. And these
two universal values of the Amazon asset are deeply inter-
twined, thus offering a high-profile manifestation of the
globally meaningful relationship between biodiversity, eco-
systems, and the economy. Heal (2007) summarizes this rela-
tionship as follows:
. . . biodiversity is a fundamental part of an ecosystem, and its
loss is thought by biologists to affect mainly the robustness and
productivity of ecosystems. We can think of ecosystems as
capital assets. Ecosystems matter economically because they
provide services that are of great value to human societies. (p.
15)
This brings me to a relatively new focus of environmental
economics that, albeit not identified with or confined to the
knowledge-based economy, is of direct relevance to the sub-
ject of this article, for it bridges national and global perspec-
tives. At the heart of this focus is the imperative that we think
of ecosystems as providers of services crucial to the func-
tioning of the earth's life support systems. In addition, we
must quantify the contribution of these services to human
well-being--also as returns on investment in conserving or
restoring the natural capital (for an overview and key refer-
ences, see Barbier, 2014). For example, the capacity to con-
sume carbon during photosynthesis and, thus, reduce
greenhouse gas emissions is now a pivotal argument in sup-
port of rain forest conservation. This argument, premised on
the enormous environmental services these biodiversity-rich
ecosystems provide to the rest of the world, gained an
unprecedented political backing from the world's govern-
ments at the global climate agreement adopted by 195 coun-
tries in Paris in December 2015. Article 5 of the Paris
Agreement sets the stage for forests to play a major role in
the fight against climate change, financed by results-based
payments from developed to developing countries (United
Nations/Framework Convention on Climate Change/
Conference of the Parties, 2015).
The launch, in 2012, of the Ecosystem Services journal
has added a voice and publication channel to the quest for
better knowledge of the ecological systems that provide the
services, of the economic systems that benefit from them,
and of the institutions that ought to be established to develop
effective codes for sustainable use (Braat & de Groot, 2012).
Estimation of the global accounting value of ecosystem ser-
vices in monetary units is a particularly daunting task (de
Groot et al., 2012). From the pioneer estimate of US$33 tril-
lion as the economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16
biomes (Costanza et al., 1997) to the estimated loss of
between US$4.3 and US$20.2 trillion/year due to the loss of
ecosystem services caused by global land-use changes
between 1997 and 2011 (Costanza et al., 2014), these approx-
imations of the magnitude of global ecosystem services are
invaluable for raising global awareness about the unsustain-
ability of these services' present location largely outside the
market.
My own search for a globally relevant model and strategy
for reckoning the natural capital's value for enlightened eco-
nomic development that would yield lasting benefits for the
environment and humanity has centered on the economically
uncharted yet uniquely unifying territory of the earth's evo-
lutionary and ecological fabric and on the priceless knowl-
edge resource woven into this fabric. This focus--and the
actions it has engendered--is not meant to replace or deni-
grate any of the existing directions and achievements in envi-
ronmental economics, science diplomacy, international
conservation, or any other field or discipline. It seeks to
complement and, hopefully, enrich and accelerate the exist-
ing efforts and their convergence in facilitating the world's
journey toward knowledge-powered sustainable prosperity
and environmental security.
The Economic Geography of Wonder
A National Perspective
Invitations from two nations--Fiji and Panama, respectively
and consecutively--presented extraordinary opportunities
for refining in concept (in Fiji) and validating (in Panama) an
economic-development model I built on the assertion that
the scientific value of a nation's heritage bounty could
become the nation's principal economic resource (H. Ayala,
1997).
Fiji, the South Pacific nation comprised of more than 350
islands, boasts a myriad of island types, ecologies, geological
formations, and fossil records that together offer unparalleled,
yet largely overlooked testimony to the evolution of islands
and coral reefs over millions of years. Panama is a geological
wonderland packed with marine fossils that chronicle the
bonding of a vast archipelago into the present-day isthmus
that divides oceans and unites continents and along which
Ayala 5
countless plant and animal species have migrated and inter-
mingled between the Americas, endowing it with breathtak-
ing botanical and faunal diversity.
Examined nationwide, the spectra of Fiji's and Panama's
respective natural diversities position these two countries
ahead of most of the world's nations as mega-reserves of
knowledge for deciphering the planet's past and planning its
future. This astonishing potential of added value reveals
itself--in both cases--only at the level of the entire country.
Rigorous research themes that would crisscross the country
in search of novel and vital linkages among areas possessed
of natural legacies would captivate the growing environmen-
tal and learning interests of international leisure travelers
while consolidating a knowledge resource of global signifi-
cance. They would provide a unique foundation upon which
"Tourism, Conservation, and Research" (TCR) could be
master-planned to grow together and become a catalyst of
national well-being and international prestige fed by a labo-
ratory of knowledge valuable to multiple sectors of the
economy.
The Fiji I deemed an unparalleled heritage bank and eco-
logical theater--in contrast with the existing, homogenized
market image of that country as an island paradise--inspired
the TCR economic-development platform (H. Ayala, 1995b,
1995c). Panama served as the ideal receptor for the TCR
platform's validation via the TCR Action Plan for Panama,
which I carried out from April 1998 through March 2000 (H.
Ayala, 1999, 2000a, 2004). The location, in Panama, of the
renowned Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI)
complemented that country's heritage bounty with another
singular asset that had also been entirely omitted in the tradi-
tional economic-development plan and outlook. STRI's
world-class research, I argued, embodied an outstanding
business value in view of the global recognition and lasting
appeal it would inject into a TCR platform for Panama's sus-
tainable future. Ira Rubinoff (1998), STRI director (1974-
2008), remarks upon this:
Did she mean that STRI would be expected to give practical
advice upon which other people would be making substantial
financial investment? . . . Here our work is expected to have an
immediate relevance to society . . . I am happy to pledge STRI's
participation. (pp. 2-3, 5)
The involvement of STRI's executives and experts con-
tributed cutting-edge substance to the TCR Action Plan's key
outcome: a nationwide network of 23 heritage routes based
on themes that span Panama on various spatial scales, reach
millions of years back in time, and simultaneously profile
and strengthen the economic, conservation, and research val-
ues of the heritage assets they interlink. For example, The
Route of the Three Oceans exalts the discovery that--on the
Pacific side--Panama adjoins two distinctive oceanographic
zones. These two zones, in terms of their ecology, represent
two different oceans and, thus, paired with the Atlantic,
endow the country with three oceans. Comparative genetic
studies that would be carried out simultaneously in these
three oceans of Panama would be of extraordinary signifi-
cance for deciphering species evolution and adaptation.
Apart from its obvious scientific and conservation impor-
tance, the three-ocean theme offers an effective tool for posi-
tioning Panama as an international leisure destination.
The heritage-theme network has anchored a pilot union of
hotel partners (H. Ayala, 2000b) and inspired novel architec-
tural, legal, and capacity-building models and strategies
(Aguilar & Saied, 2004; Ayers, 1999; Hogrefe, 1999-2000;
Miller, 1999; Nemecek, 1999). Sánchez (1998), who--as
then National Secretary of Science, Technology, and
Innovation--led the Panamanian Government's support and
involvement, defined this pilot national project's overall
value as follows:
The Tourism-Conservation-Research Action Plan is an
innovative opportunity . . . in which our country's natural capital,
geographical features, cultural heritage, and geological history
are conjoined to generate sustainable tourism development, a
solvent conservation policy, and an ever-increasing knowledge
base of our nation's assets. (p. 76)
Formally endorsing the TCR model and its pilot applica-
tion in Panama on behalf of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science (AAAS), Nicholson (1999) high-
lights this model's potential to use science in the promotion
of human welfare and human progress on a scale that could
not otherwise happen. Yet, using a scale defined by a nation's
borders only scratches the surface of this opportunity. A
political line cannot define a geographical area within which
to appreciate, engage, and guard a data bank pool fashioned
by nature.
A Regional Perspective
Panama's natural capital and its knowledge content are inter-
twined with those of the entire Central American land bridge
that harbors some 10% of the world's biodiversity. In the
marine realm, they are an integral part of a biological corri-
dor engendered by the convergence of major oceanic cur-
rents, nurturing an exceptional spectrum of marine life, and
reaching deep into the Pacific. Similarly, Fiji's treasure trove
of evolutionary and ecological legacies contributes to and
grows in prominence amid the daunting diversity and com-
plementarity of natural environments all across the Pacific
island ecosystems--a diversity currently outside traditional
economic-development strategies.
At the invitation of the UNESCO Office for the Pacific
States, I prepared a study that recognized the South Pacific
Island Region as an exquisite candidate for a development strat-
egy that would interlink, value, and protect the region's geologi-
cal formations, archaeological legacies, and land and marine
ecosystems (H. Ayala, 2005). Ranked as the biologically most
6 SAGE Open
opulent places on earth, many of these areas would serve as
immense data banks that are systematically unlocked through
scientific exploration in concert with developing a regional
tourism industry second to none. Noteworthy is this strategy's
synergy with "Vaka Moana--Ocean Roads of the Pacific," a
cultural program of UNESCO that seeks to assist the Pacific
peoples to further develop their shared heritage and to promote
economic development consistent with the conservation and
careful use of the region's resources (Voi, 2005).
However, the boundaries of the Pacific Island nations'
portfolio represented by the UNESCO Pacific Office are not
the final markers of a geographical area within which to
appreciate, engage, and guard nature's data bank pool.
Recent studies of the geography of coral reef diversity (i.e.,
of the pattern of species richness on coral reefs, which is a
fundamental precondition for informed decisions regarding
the conservation and management of these globally threat-
ened and declining hotbeds of biodiversity) are disclosing a
fascinating mosaic of cradles of species richness and of dis-
persal routes that draw affinities among variously distant
ocean regions and archipelagos. Major contributions along
these lines (Reaka & Lombardi, 2011; Reaka, Rodgers, &
Kudla, 2008) have revealed that the diversity of the primary
groups of contemporary Indo-West Pacific coral reef organ-
isms peaks in the East Indies triangle (Malaysia, Indonesia,
New Guinea, and the Philippines) of the Indo-Australian
Archipelago, reaches a lower peak in East Africa and
Madagascar, and declines in the central Indian Ocean and
central Pacific. What a splendid, yet untapped, resource this
exploration reveals for the development of intellectual
delights that would give a visitor to any one of these diversity
hotspots insights into the coral reef heritage of the entire
Indo-Pacific. What an opportunity this resource opens for
positioning the rarity, inspiration, and educational value of
such insights as business incentives for investments in the
continuation of this ground-breaking research and its transla-
tion into conservation and sustainable-management mea-
sures of international scope and influence.
A global scale is the only scale with which to fully dis-
close, consolidate, value, and protect the natural reserves of
the knowledge stock, within a multiplicity of overlaying
units delimited by geological, evolutionary, and ecological
markers.
A Transnational/Global Perspective
The subject of connectivity is becoming ever more prominent
and relevant as a conservation imperative. Based on their
study of connectivity conservation projects and experiences
throughout the world, Worboys, Francis, and Lockwood
(2010) offer guidance for national and international connec-
tivity conservation initiatives, with emphasis on large-scale,
naturally interconnected areas--also as critical strategic and
adaptive responses to climate change. They demonstrate the
importance of connectivity conservation for sustaining the
ecosystem services of terrestrial and marine environments
and for enabling plant and animal movement between habitat
patches as well as for preserving connectedness required by
spatially dependent evolutionary processes.
There is another dimension of connectivity that could be
referred to as contextual connectivity and that both shapes
and is shaped by bold research endeavors of transnational
scales but of trajectories that are spatially patchy in the pres-
ent world. Reaka's (2014) novel approach to deciphering the
patterns of global endemism and diversity brings to light evo-
lutionary linkages that tie various ocean biotas to ancient
marine-diversity centers elsewhere in the world. These link-
ages do not entail any physical or functional connectivity at
present, but they are of immense value to science and conser-
vation as well as of considerable potential to boost the worth
and stature of currently overlooked heritage assets and their
locales. Reaka confirms that, today, the pinnacles of global
marine and terrestrial diversity occur in the Old World Indo-
Australian tropics, the New World tropics, and, to a lesser
extent, the southwestern Indian Ocean. But it was not always
so, she asserts. Two hundred million years ago, a single global
center of diversity occurred in the Tethys Seaway (Europe,
North Africa, and the contiguous Americas). This fertile cen-
ter of endemism and diversity spawned most of our modern
marine and terrestrial organisms. It is within this retrospective
that some endemic corals in Brazil, found to belong to old
relict lineages known from fossil representatives in the Tethys
Seaway, acquire a universal-legacy rank. More disclosures of
such priceless living relics can also be expected in retracing a
second center of diversity and endemism that arose (~100-50
million years ago) in the New World tropics as the Atlantic
Ocean opened and as Africa and the southern continents
crashed northward into Eurasia. The eastern Tethyan species
migrated south and east, forming new centers of diversity in
the southwestern Indian Ocean and SoutheastAsia as recently
as 20 million years ago. Understanding the dynamics of spe-
ciation and extinction across these ancient gateways--with
their legacy biotas as well as their newly sprouted species--
by using recently available genetic techniques is, according to
Reaka, one of the greatest challenges and opportunities of the
21st century.
The concept of Pleistocene Parks or Phylogeographic
Sanctuaries (Avise, 2008) dovetails a visionary, cutting-edge
science with another contextually blended yet now spatially
fragmented perspective synergistic with Reaka's.
Researching and interpreting the spatial distribution of gene-
alogical lineages, especially within and among closely
related species--which is the essence of phylogeography, a
biological field he founded--Avise has discovered that many
of these distinctive lineages began diverging from one
another in unglaciated biological refugia of the Pleistocene
Epoch or earlier. The aggregate scientific and conservation
importance of these legacy biotas underpins his call for a
carefully designed network of phylogeographic reserves on
each continent and in each marine region that could be
Ayala 7
promoted and distinguished in a similar fashion as historical
landmarks honoring important events in human affairs.
Comparative phylogeography is shedding a new light on
the origins of marine biodiversity. Across the world's tropical
oceans, the biodiversity hotspots (prominently the already
mentionedEastIndiesCoralTriangle,aswellastheCaribbean)
have been widely recognized as evolutionary incubators of
new species and contrasted with endemism hotspots (such as
Hawaii and Red Sea). Phylogeographic studies are now shat-
tering this distinction: Both biodiversity hotspots and ende-
mism hotspots are important in producing novel evolutionary
lineages and may work together to enhance biodiversity on the
ocean planet (Bowen et al., 2016).
The connectivity-enhanced appreciation and mutual rein-
forcement of the natural knowledge banks will unfold along
paths that stretch beyond national jurisdictions. This poses a
unique challenge, underscored by the following excerpt from
the January 2010 report on New Frontiers in Science
Diplomacy (Koppelman, Day, Davison, Elliott, & Wilsdon,
2010), an international event hosted by the Royal Society of
London in partnership with the AAAS:
International spaces beyond national jurisdictions--including
Antarctica, the high seas, the deep sea and outer space--cannot
be managed through conventional models of governance and
diplomacy, and will require flexible approaches to international
cooperation, informed by scientific evidence and underpinned
by practical scientific partnerships. (p. 18)
I would add that these international spaces will also require
novel, internationally viable, and sustainable strategies of
basic research funding.
Basic scientific research is largely the domain of govern-
ment funding; it does not involve capital market valuation. It
has been bypassed by the recent boom in science philan-
thropy spearheaded by some of the richestAmericans (Broad,
2014). The dependence on government funding can and
often does become a major hindrance to the ambition and
execution of research visions, particularly in basic science
projects that transcend national borders.
The knowledge resource pool rooted in earth's evolution-
ary and ecological fabric is transnational. While knowledge
derived from natural resources in a particular country should
be shared with and benefit that country, the knowledge yielded
by research insights into transnational threads of earth's natu-
ral fabric ought to be treated as a global asset that benefits all
of humanity. I conceived this position with a business model in
mind and have made this model's refinement--and empower-
ment via science diplomacy--the centerpieces of my work on
the geography of wonder for some 20 years.
Business Model With a Mission
In their pioneer assessment of the value of the world's eco-
system services and natural capital, Costanza et al. (1997)
make the following point:
If ecosystem services were actually paid for, in terms of their
value contribution to the global economy, the global price
system would be very different from what it is today. The price
of commodities using ecosystem services directly or indirectly
would be much greater. (p. 259)
An analogy can be drawn in the context of the global
repository of the knowledge mineral. The world over,
hotspots for resort ventures and for investments in resort-
styled private retreats coincide with some of the most diverse,
biologically rich, and often intricately linked ecosystems that
are yet to be revealed as treasure troves of currently undis-
covered knowledge. These exceptional locations are entering
the global market as merely premier real estate, grossly
underappreciated and undervalued as contributors to a
knowledge economy. Both the host countries and the inves-
tors bear the loss, which opens a unique opportunity for
changing the status quo on the premise of hard-nosed
economics.
The resort industry's enthusiasm for capitalizing on the
wonder premium found in many of its information-dense set-
tings to create experiences that engage the intellect is in its
infancy compared with the sophistication achieved in the
concept and delivery of hospitality and service. Entirely dor-
mant, in business capitalization, are many of these settings'
links to much larger realms of wonder.
Peer-reviewed tourism and hospitality publications have
become venues for a series of articles in which I first defined
this argument; suggested planning, design, and management
philosophies that would translate it into solutions; and demon-
strated the benefits on a pilot hotel portfolio I guided in Panama
(H. Ayala 1991a, 1991b, 1993, 1995a, 1996, 2000b). The
objective, limned in my continued work on the subject, has
been to bring science--and, through science, conservation--
into the heart of a business model in which product quality,
competitiveness, and prestige grow along with the geographi-
cal footprint of the underwritten research. Here is how.
Science holds the key to unlocking the context of the
resort's setting. One dimension of this context is the setting's
connection to a larger ecosystem. Moreover, science can
reveal affinities (evolutionary, ecological, and other) that con-
nect the destination's natural heritage resources with those
found in various parts of the destination's broader region and
elsewhere in the world. Through such revelations, science can
empower the resort to capitalize on its setting as a window into
a far-reaching labyrinth of wonder. The experience--live,
uniquely meaningful, and uniquely immune to imitation by
being offered from a vantage point inside this labyrinth--will
be profoundly different from experiences gained in a museum.
A strategic alliance that would enable the resort to nourish this
experience with ongoing access to scientific exploration
would offer to reward patrons with first-class intellectual plea-
sures and to continuously upgrade--with the help of exhibits,
images, and other tools--the novelty and educational value of
these delights through access to a flow of discoveries.
8 SAGE Open
This business strategy generates robust incentives for an
infusion of investments--not donations--into research,
training, development of scientific infrastructures (such as
research stations), conservation-tailored employment, and
other safeguards of the project's business performance across
vast landscapes and seascapes--beyond the resort's property
lines--where traditional models of economic development
would collide with the carrying capacities of these environ-
ments. This creates benefit zones that surpass, in scale and
capacity for sustainable development, existing approaches to
linking business models with destinations' conservation and
social priorities. And this also opens new frontiers for the
work in economics that has explored the distinctive proper-
ties of knowledge as a public good.
In their influential articles, Nelson (1959) and Arrow
(1962) reveal the limitations of private profit opportunities to
draw socially desirable quantity of resources into basic
research--limitations fueled by the business value of monop-
oly over the funded research findings. Making the case for
basic scientific research as the prime source of significant
advances in knowledge, Nelson (1959) notes,
Often the new knowledge is of greatest value as a key input of
other research projects . . . For this reason scientists have long
argued for free and wide communication of research results, and
for this reason natural "laws" and facts are not patentable. (p.
302)
As Arrow (1962) explains, appreciating and capitalizing on
knowledge as a precursor of future knowledge does not align
with the operation of private enterprise system and its empha-
sis on property rights:
To appropriate information for use as a basis for further research
is much more difficult than to appropriate it for use in producing
commodities; and the value of information for use in developing
further information is much more conjectural than the value of
its use in production and therefore much more likely to be
underestimated. (p. 618)
I assert that the international resort enterprise is well posi-
tioned and economically motivated to defy the free-enter-
prise economics of basic research and to become the principal
business partner in science-oriented valuation and consolida-
tion of the geographies-bridging knowledge-mineral veins.
Worthy of emphasis is the fact that the extraction and appre-
ciation of the knowledge resource in the context of tourism,
which is primarily an exercise in interpretation, does not
involve the ownership of knowledge as intellectual property
and, thus, is fully compatible with the underwritten scientific
discoveries' sharing and conducive to their cross-fertiliza-
tion--as seeds of new harvests of wonder--within multiple
research endeavors. The more prominent and "expansive"
would the scale and scientific importance of a resort-engaged
knowledge vein be, the greater would also be the business
incentive to help value and protect large swaths of naturally
privileged areas across the world, without depriving the host
countries of their ownership and without denying conserva-
tion-minded access to these areas by others. As a result, the
returns on investment would encompass a formidable
legacy.
It is the legacy reward that aligns the momentous trend of
ecophilanthropic ventures with this immense opportunity
waiting to be tapped. Ecophilanthropy, which counts some of
the world's wealthiest individuals including high-profile cor-
porate leaders and celebrities among its champions, involves
purchases of natural areas to protect them or to restore their
ecosystems. Increasingly, these land acquisitions or private
concessions, often of daunting scales, are introducing and
underwriting biological and ecological research programs
within their boundaries. More and more frequently, they also
include luxury hotel projects intended to both support and be
supported by these private natural reserves and are master-
planned to become vanguard models of environmental sensi-
tivity and sustainability (Bell & Bristow, 2013; Doerr, 2011;
Rush, 2005). One can observe a growing synergy and pro-
gressively blurred line between these hotel-anchored
ecophilanthropic ventures and the sustainability theme
embracing trophy purchases of private islands and other
exceptional properties in naturally prominent settings, such
as the recent purchases of Lana'i by Oracle's Chief Larry
Ellison (Mooallem, 2014) and of Blackadore Caye off the
coast of Belize by the actor and environmental activist
Leonardo DiCaprio (Satow, 2015).
However, these laudable development models and their
research missions do not recognize or capitalize on their
potential to acquire an entirely enhanced spatial dimension
and generate business and legacy premiums on the wings of
ecological, evolutionary, and other affinities that tie the tour-
ism- and philanthropy-courting property with its larger eco-
system and with natural legacies elsewhere in the world. The
pursuit of such contextual amplification--amplification that
would be mapped by science and achieved and enjoyed
through interpretive tools--would not be conditioned on
purchasing any additional real estate. It would be entirely
exempt from the backlash that some of the large-scale
ecophilanthropic acquisitions have encountered in the host
countries and local communities that become suspicious
about the motives behind them (Wolford, 2012). The contex-
tually amplified properties would also be eminently primed
for partnerships of shared capacity to champion daring cross-
national science and conservation initiatives in a pragmati-
cally effective and economically sustainable fashion. Such
joined endeavors would empower each participating prop-
erty to develop intellectual bounty nurtured by multiple won-
der hotspots, prompting ever more ambitious research
questions and, with them, ever more intriguing insights into
various global ecosystem networks that entail ever grander
legacy opportunities. They would be highly conducive to
treating the knowledge mobilized through transnational
research of natural legacies as a global asset destined to
Ayala 9
benefit all of humanity, because such an approach and its
stewardship would further augment the stature of the partici-
pating estates and their owners.
Central to this perspective and strategy is the disclosure of
the unmatched potential of the resort enterprise to reap major
business dividends from investments in geographically unre-
strained, monopoly-free basic research endeavors and, in the
process, to facilitate the transformative scale of the economic
model that treats the knowledge-rich natural capital as a life-
line of the global knowledge economy. The pursuit of this
potential will in no way diminish the prospective benefits
that the knowledge exploited to enrich the rewards of world
travel may carry for the agricultural and fishing industries,
for education, as well as for other sectors of the destinations'
economies. No doubt, the discoveries brought to light along
the global paths of knowledge veins, through comparisons
and correlations among multiple research sites and themes,
will generate unprecedented opportunities for investigating
and employing natural substances to foster human well-
being. Countries transected by these veins of discoveries will
gain a strong standing as partners in potential wider exploita-
tion of the unearthed knowledge by the medical (pharmaceu-
tical) or other global industries.
Avise (2008) commends this business-model-with-a-mis-
sion for its capacity to promote science and protect biodiver-
sity as an integral part of the business plan itself, yielding "a
global archipelago of interconnected `wonder sites' where
the scientific study and preservation of nature are the explicit
and formal motivation for linking sustainable economics
with science" (p. 11567). The road map for employing this
business model is embedded within a still larger ambition to
awaken the extraordinary potential of the global crop of
environmentally progressive resort and private estates col-
lectively to provide an economic and logistical foundation
for building transnational knowledge economies that both
draw strength from and strengthen the world's premier natu-
ral heritage reserves. Integral to this ambition is to demon-
strate that blocks of natural heritage­rich countries, shaped
by tectonic activity, evolution, and other forces that have
molded the world's most opulent veins of the knowledge
mineral, could shape this emerging knowledge economy as
profoundly as oil-rich countries have influenced the tradi-
tional economy.
I have embarked on the pursuit of this ambition backed by
the Pangea World organization I founded to serve as a cata-
lyst (H. Ayala, 2003; Lempinen, 2006; Lew, 2007; Loose,
2013; Wiesnerová, 2013). The Pacific has become, once
again, the focal point.
Wealth Infrastructure Attuned to
Nature
A formalized partnership between the UNESCO Office for
the Pacific States and Pangea World (ratified on October 9,
2008) set the stage for the launch--at the West Coast
Headquarters of the National Academies on April 15,
2009--of Pangea World's pilot transnational project
(Brennan, 2009). Named The Pacific Bridge to Noble
Wealth, this project singles out the Pacific as a superb cross-
roads of heritage themes of global significance. It seeks to
build a knowledge supra structure that will release, harness,
and value the collective reservoir of dormant scientific
knowledge enclosed in the past and present connections,
dynamics, and relationships that transcend the mega-diverse
natural heritage of the island-dotted tropical Pacific; that
reach to and interface with islands and ecosystems of the
Pacific coast of the Americas; and that further augment this
collective natural reservoir of knowledge capital along the
ocean-linked biological networks of the larger Indo-Pacific
region. It offers a platform for combining the argument
about the economic value of ecosystem services with the
argument about the economic potential of the veins of the
knowledge mineral as repositories of the raw material for
the knowledge economy that double in market worth as
sources of wonder for high-value experiences of the
Pacific's--and the world's--natural splendors.
A core task behind the envisioned supra structure of
knowledge is to engender a development model that con-
trasts with the conflict-ridden contests over the use of natural
resources that plague many parts of the world and are often
compounded by competing views of what is desirable: eco-
nomic development for immediate wealth creation versus
conservation of resources for the benefit of future genera-
tions. The PBNW multinational supra structure of knowl-
edge veins is master-planned from its earliest conceptual
stage on proactive guarantees of borderless social benefit,
economic energy, and political support.
The PBNW master plan invites the University of the
South Pacific--an international teaching and research body
owned by and spread across 12 Pacific Island countries--to
become a prominent partner in the mapping and exploration
of these countries' knowledge veins and, in the process, to
further develop the university's research might and its capac-
ity to shape the region's future. The master plan also revives
my earlier proposal to UNESCO that they consider extend-
ing the World Heritage designation to heritage themes and
relationships of exceptional scientific and conservation
importance, anchored by networks of heritage assets that
reveal them (H. Ayala, 2005). Even though they will initially
radiate from and across the Pacific region, these relation-
ships are expected to disclose value-adding affinities among
heritage sites on trans-regional and global scales.
This strategy in no way substitutes, compromises, inter-
feres, or competes with national, regional, or global conser-
vation efforts and laws, nor with the existing protection
status of a heritage resource. In fact, quite the opposite will
occur in terms of contributions toward the economic security
of conservation. In the PBNW context, the delimitation of
knowledge veins and their positioning as routes of wonder
entails a financial mechanism that will systematically
10 SAGE Open
encourage the open-ended, geographically unrestrained sci-
entific exploration that is beyond the reach of the conven-
tional government-based research grants and beyond the
focus of the corporate funding of immediate profit-making
ideas. It entails a proactive layout of an investment network
of staging areas, that is, sites selected because of their ideal
locations at the crossroads of future insights into multiple
routes of wonder and, to the maximum degree possible, also
because of their overlay with properties that currently are or
likely will be promoted and traded as high-value real estate
assets. This investment scenario enjoys a considerable
momentum because it is tailored to an investment trend that
already exists, namely, the rise--and vanishing line--
between ecophilanthropic ventures, which are increasingly
combined with luxury hospitality projects, and purchases of
private islands and other valuable natural properties for
upscale ecoresort developments that increasingly support
their image of exclusivity with sustainability initiatives. It
offers to take the transformative influence of this unfolding
investment trend to an entirely new level of benefit and pres-
tige. This focus is pragmatic in that it treats the wealth that
defines the high-end market pool behind this trend as an
opportunity to launch projects of the stature and power to
make environmental and social contributions of a magnitude
that will draw international attention and seed inspiration
across the world.
Embedded in the expansive supra structure of routes of
wonder, the staging areas will endow the facilities they sup-
port--be it private estates or resort operations--with the
capacity to pursue unprecedented ecophilanthropic aspira-
tions and to appeal to the deep curiosity of people about the
world we live in, without sacrificing the traditional pleasures
of present-day luxury resorts and private retreats. Individually
and collectively, these facilities will have the capacity to set
new standards of excellence in experience management by
processing and packaging the science-mediated revelation of
wonder in a manner that generates economic energy, facili-
tates new scientific breakthroughs, creates novel employment
opportunities in resource conservation, and portrays invest-
ments in knowledge-weighted appreciation of natural capital
as emblems of business stewardship. The wonder-route
matrix with its clusters of staging areas are especially devised
to ensure that the science-mapped, interpretation-consoli-
dated routes across ecologically sensitive ecosystems and
into economically depressed and remote rural areas do not
subject them to harmful visitor traffic while opening them to
social and environmental benefits whose spectrum will be
optimized in consultation with UNESCO Pacific. A key
objective and function of the staging areas is to encourage and
facilitate the setup of research stations and laboratories along
the routes of wonder, thus building and strengthening the host
countries' own capacity to utilize their knowledge mineral
while producing a lasting economic incentive to protect the
prime natural repositories of this resource. As a result, each
route of wonder, which will typically wind across multiple
countries, will become a potent catalyst of a "cross-national
unit of sustainable development."
This offer of robust appreciation of the staging-area
investment in stature, market worth, and legacy rewards is
guided by utmost selectivity: selectivity in terms of the mag-
nitude of the environmental and social benefits that the
investment will spur along the paths of contextual access
exclusive to each staging area. This notion and execution of
exclusivity is most inclusive in that it strengthens the natural
treasuries of the knowledge capital that belong to the host
nations and, at the transnational level, to humanity. It offers
to empower these nations to move from their current depen-
dency on donations and foreign aid to true independence and
economic stewardship, fueled by high-quality investments
that both nurture and are nurtured by the region's collective
heritage bounty.
According to Pongi (2009), the approach shepherded by
the PBNW project
integrates UNESCO's goals into a broader aspiration to plant,
across the Pacific Island Region, a model sustainable economy
that derives strength from the spectacular scientific value of the
region's natural heritage. It seeks to employ Pangea's tool of the
"Hospitality-Science" alliance as a strategic and investment
framework for interlinking and accelerating the pursuits of the
region's development needs and conservation priorities.
This approach also stimulates a paradigm change of
immense promise for sustainable development: a change
from the established practice of protecting natural assets by
setting them aside from the economy to bringing them into
the very heart of economic-development strategies in a man-
ner that guarantees their protection.
The implementation path is strongly grounded in science
diplomacy. A gathering of Pacific Island leaders titled
Engaging With the Pacific was held in Fiji in July 2010. On
July 23, this gathering hosted the regional unveiling of the
Pacific Bridge vision and strategy (Fiji's Ministry of
Information, 2010). The political support engendered by this
unveiling gave birth to an important alliance. Speaking at an
international event at the United Nations International School
(UNIS) in New York on September 19, 2010, Fiji's President
Ratu Epeli Nailatikau (2010) confirms the announcement he
made at the Fiji gathering 2 months earlier:
I accepted the invitation to become Chair of the initiative to
extend The Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth right across the
entire region of the Pacific Island nations. The regional leaders
at that meeting honored me with their support . . . I accepted this
role in the very strong belief that this initiative can transform our
region into an economic power house.
Kiribati's President Anote Tong added his endorsement:
The Pacific Bridge to Noble Wealth advocated under the Pangea
World Project provides the economic rationale for protecting the
Ayala 11
natural heritage of future generations and is an innovative
concept which offers options available at a time when climate
change has highlighted human abuse of this planet. (Embassy of
the Republic of Fiji, 2010, p. 1)
Legacy Investments as Cradles of Earth-Nurturing
Economic Partnerships
A symposium cohosted by the West Coast Headquarters of
the National Academies and UC Irvine on February 7, 2014,
reinforced the academic credentials of the PBNW invest-
ment strategy and showcased the prospective multiplier of
benefits from just one staging area.
The event's agenda placed an emphasis on the mutually
reinforcing relationship that intertwines Pangea World's leg-
acy-investment business model and the science-guided sus-
tainable-development strategy, and on this relationship's
relevance and expected contribution to sustainability
science.
Michael Clegg, the Donald Bren Professor of Biological
Sciences at UC Irvine and foreign secretary of the U.S. National
Academy of Sciences, underscored the importance of the Pangea
World concept as a model for sustainability. "In order to improve
the quality of human life in the face of increasing demands on
our earth's resources, we must develop scientific approaches to
problems of sustainability," Clegg said. "Pangea World's vision
embodies strategic synergies linking the creation and utilization
of scientific knowledge to a business model firmly grounded in
legacy investment opportunities." (UC Irvine, 2014)
Each legacy investment--and the resort or private legacy
estate driving this investment--will engage and yield bene-
fits across a transnational geographical unit that defies politi-
cal borders. The symposium introduced Panama's Las Perlas
Archipelago, off the country's Pacific coast, as a model set-
ting of immense biological, ecological, and geological inter-
est and transnational connectivity--across the Central
American isthmus and the larger Pacific--as a laboratory of
evolution. An investment in harnessing this setting's formi-
dable capacity to offer science-fueled insights into a monu-
mental ecosystem complex would acquire limitless potential
to appreciate in stature and legacy rewards. It could help
transform from donations dependent to investment worthy
such vital conservation projects as the Pacific-Asia
Biodiversity Transect (PABITRA), which seeks to interlink
the naturally fragmented Pacific-wide biomes into a compre-
hensive network for a regional approach to biodiversity
research and conservation management. It could engender an
unprecedented economic and conservation partnership
between countries spanned by PABITRA and the Central
American nations linked via PABITRA's analog, the
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, and stimulate an expan-
sion of this novel sustainable-development alliance across
other countries along the ocean-linked biological networks
of the larger Indo-Pacific Region.
In many Pacific island nations--which are among the world's
top biodiversity hotspots threatened by climate change--the
Pangea World transnational model for the global knowledge
economy can offer a lifeline for their peoples' future. "Pangea
World's strategy of interlinking and valuing multiple pools of
knowledge-rich natural capital with a legacy investment in the
Panama islands can provide a new economic geography for the
future benefit of our people," said Winston Thompson, Fiji's
ambassador to the United States. "We remain strongly committed
to this vision." (UC Irvine, 2014)
Redefining the Global Transformative Role of the
Pacific
Leon Panetta, then the U.S. Secretary of Defense, stated in a
speech he delivered in Singapore in June 2012: "While the
U.S. will remain a global force for security and stability, we
will of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region"
(Himmelman, 2013, p. 29). He referred to the United States
as a "Pacific Nation" (p. 29). On October 5, 2015, the U.S.
Trade Representative Michael Froman announced successful
conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations,
aimed at easing trading between the United States and 11
other Pacific Rim nations--Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile,
Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore,
and Vietnam (Chappell, 2015). My assessment of the Pacific
as a region of vital importance to the United States has a
complementary but very different premise, focused on the
island-dotted ocean region circled by the Rim. This premise
links this Pacific nation, whose world-class academic
resources, business foresight, and investment power make it
an icon of the existing definition of knowledge economy,
with a horizon line beyond which, hidden to the eye, lies a
vast, priceless pool of knowledge-mineral veins upon which
the future of national, regional, and global economies will be
founded. It invites economically savvy science and conser-
vation collaborations among nations, corporations, and insti-
tutions not yet perceived as strategic partners in the current
scenarios of international trade.
Turning a Vision Into a Sustainability
Partnership
According to a United Nations press release, Pangea World's
multinational approach represents "an unprecedented oppor-
tunity to fortify a knowledge bank with incalculable value to
strengthen and sustain the emerging global knowledge econ-
omy, one that could elevate the conservation of the planet's
most exquisite and vulnerable places into an economic imper-
ative" (United Nations Department of Public Information,
2010, p. 2).
It became a foremost priority for me to endow this oppor-
tunity with the propensity to grow in vigor and endurance as
it materializes, starting in the Pacific context. It became an
equally important priority for me to ensure that Pangea
12 SAGE Open
World's endeavor to assist, complement, and accelerate the
existing efforts of international government to protect and
sustain common pool resources does and will perpetually
adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity. The
earlier mentioned symposium held at the West Coast
Headquarters of the National Academies and cohosted by
UC Irvine on February 7, 2014, served as a catalyst for the
pursuit of these priorities.
The vision and transnational effort spearheaded by
Pangea World will, inevitably, continue evolving, because
they will follow and engage the advancing frontiers and
capabilities of scientific exploration across a dynamic
world. Their essential capacity for change is synergistic
with the imperative of excellence-nurturing creativity and
receptivity to new opportunities that defines top-caliber aca-
demic environments, embodied by UC Irvine and its sister
UC campuses. It was on the premise of this synergy that I
used the event's stage to announce formally my desire to
bond the future of Pangea World's mission with the UC and
to anchor its headquarters in the distinguished context of UC
Irvine's academic preeminence--and that of its neighbor,
the National Academies' West Coast Headquarters--and in
the pledge of this mission's and headquarters' eventual pas-
sage to this university.
I have been honored by the reception that greeted my
desire and aspiration (Drake, 2014). The event "revealed a
nascent strategic partnership that could place UC Irvine at
the forefront of high-level science diplomacy for global sus-
tainability" (UC Irvine, 2014). It also underscored that the
time had come to appreciate--at national, regional, and
global levels--the existing and planned protected areas as
knowledge banks whose consolidation will unfold along
very different paths from those defining the expansions and
mergers of their financial counterparts: paths paved by geo-
logical, evolutionary, and other forces that have molded the
natural capital across geographies.
Novel designs of conservation networks that double in
value and function as research networks are pivotal to this
perspective. This is where California holds a great asset in
the UC Natural Reserve System--the world's largest uni-
versity-administered network of protected areas (Fiedler,
Gee Rumsey, & Wong, 2013). Born from a visionary idea to
encompass the spectacular ecological diversity of California
in a network of undisturbed environments for research, edu-
cation, and public service, this collection of reserves has
been leveraged for such prominent research projects as the
study of the effects of climate change on California ecosys-
tems by the UC-wide Institute for the Study of Ecological
and Evolutionary Climate Impacts. However, this asset is
yet to be awakened in its value as a unique competitive edge
and assurance of the sustainability of California's economic
might in this century of biology. Aiding this awakening
while inviting the UC expertise into transnational laborato-
ries for heritage-nurtured knowledge economies is a pros-
pect I embrace.
It will be highly symbolic to navigate the geographies-
bridging trajectory of the Pangea World journey from
California: a Pacific state assembled, over the last 100 mil-
lion years, via a series of seafloor eruptions and island arcs'
collisions, and linked through plate tectonics to various parts
of the present-day Indo-Pacific (McPhee, 1993). This trans-
Pacific geological identity makes California a most fitting
portal into the Pacific- and, eventually, the globe-spanning
effort to release knowledge woven into the earth's evolution-
ary and ecological fabric as a source of wealth that could
profoundly augment the global strength and sustainability of
the knowledge economy, foster a culture of peace (Mayor,
2014), and bolster conservation measures to mitigate rising
temperatures around the world.
