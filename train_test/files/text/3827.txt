Big Data, social physics, and spatial
analysis: The early years
Trevor J Barnes1 and Matthew W Wilson2
Abstract
This paper examines one of the historical antecedents of Big Data, the social physics movement. Its origins are in the
scientific revolution of the 17th century in Western Europe. But it is not named as such until the middle of the 19th
century, and not formally institutionalized until another hundred years later when it is associated with work by George
Zipf and John Stewart. Social physics is marked by the belief that large-scale statistical measurement of social variables
reveals underlying relational patterns that can be explained by theories and laws found in natural science, and physics in
particular. This larger epistemological position is known as monism, the idea that there is only one set of principles that
applies to the explanation of both natural and social worlds. Social physics entered geography through the work of the
mid-20th-century geographer William Warntz, who developed his own spatial version called ``macrogeography.'' It
involved the computation of large data sets, made ever easier with the contemporaneous development of the computer,
joined with the gravitational potential model. Our argument is that Warntz's concerns with numeracy, large data sets,
machine-based computing power, relatively simple mathematical formulas drawn from natural science, and an isomorph-
ism between natural and social worlds became grounds on which Big Data later staked its claim to knowledge; it is a past
that has not yet passed.

Introduction
Physicists not only know everything; they know every-
thing better. (Stauffer, 2004: 1)
It is easy to think that Big Data has no history, that the
clouds parted and Big Data appeared. That is the sense in
Anderson's (2008) well-known account in Wired. For
Anderson, the past is severed from the present.
Nothing that occurred in the past constrains what will
occur in the future. That is why history is irrelevant. The
past is ignored because nothing should hamper or limit
what is to come. It is a classic modernist move. In this
case, only the bright and uncluttered future of Big Data
matters (Barnes, 2013; Wilson, 2014).
Rather than focus on the future, our paper is about
the past. William Faulkner (1994: 73) famously said,
``the past is never dead. It's not even past.'' For
Faulkner past and future are inextricably joined. We
cannot escape history because the past never fully
passes. Instead, we always carry the burden of the past
into the future. The purpose of our paper is to unpack
some of Big Data's historical burden. Its past is not a
unified whole, however, a single complete history. It is
much looser, fragmented, multiple, set in relation to
many different historical processes (Jacobs, 2009).
Consequently, Big Data's past is complicated and
fraught. It is tangled up with, among other things,
complex histories of computerization, superpower
weaponry and defence strategies, military funding,

commercialization and advertising, corporatization,
government regulation, epistemological fashion and
debate, and academic disciplinary research agendas.
Clearly, we can't follow all these variegated histories
in this short paper. Instead, our aim is much more
modest. It is to set out historically only one of the ante-
cedents of Big Data: social physics. We suggest that
social physics is connected to Big Data historically
through spatial analysis: social physics, as we will
argue, influenced spatial analysis, and spatial analysis
was then incorporated into Big Data.
We recognize that not all spatial analysis derives
from social physics, however. For example, within spa-
tial analysis there is the long tradition of German loca-
tion theory that includes von Thu
¨ nen, Weber,
Christaller, and Lo
¨ sch that doesn't subscribe to social
physics at all (Barnes, 2003). The underlying rationales
for the individual works comprising the German
locational tradition vary with the particular author,
and are also bound up with the historical and geo-
graphical context in which the particular theory was
devised (Barnes, 2003). In none of these cases is social
physics the motivation, though. But there is a strand of
spatial analysis that comes from social physics, and
which in turn has shaped contemporary practices of
GIScience and Big Data (see Anselin, 2012;
Goodchild, 2004, 2009). In particular, we contend
that practices of exploratory data analysis, pattern rec-
ognition, and data mining within GIScience and Big
Data, which have produced such analytical outcomes
as prediction, modelling, intelligence, and design, stem
in part from an earlier spatial analysis and social phys-
ics. This is not to preclude other influences on Big Data
and other forms of spatial analysis, but it is to make
the connections between social physics and spatial ana-
lysis explicit.
Social physics is a long-standing interdisciplinary
mode of inquiry. From the beginning it was driven by
a belief that laws, theories, and models of physics
applied as much to social as to natural worlds. This
view is known as monism, the idea that theories of
physics explain both human and non-human worlds
(and also represented by the chutzpah found in our
paper's epigraph). The origins of monism are in
Ancient Greece, but social physics as a specific form
of enquiry did not emerge until the 17th century in
Western Europe. Following several hundred years of
fits and starts, social physics was finally institutiona-
lized in the 1940s, the result of the energetic efforts of
a motley of American academics of which the two most
important were Harvard's George K. Zipf (1902­1950)
and Princeton's John Q. Stewart (1894­1972).
Social physics entered geography in the mid-1950s
through the American geographer William Warntz
(1922­1988), who later became Director (1968­1971)
of the Harvard Laboratory for Computer Graphics
and Spatial Analysis. Warntz, who collaborated with
Stewart early on, emphasized the importance of recog-
nizing general geographical patterns through the spatial
analysis of large sets of geo-coded data. He thought
those patterns were best represented and explained by
models and theories of physics, particularly the
Newtonian (Lagrangean) potential model (Rich,
1980).1 That is, his spatial analysis was based on
social physics. To that end, Warntz made literally bil-
lions of calculations during the course of his career. At
first, a small proportion were by hand using mechanical
calculators and taking months of his life. Later, and by
far the bulk, were undertaken by a computer first in
only a few hours, which diminished to minutes, then
to seconds. Those calculations were the bases of count-
less contour surfaces of population potential that
Warntz made for the United States. On one occasion,
Warntz even made a 3-D version on his dining
room table, constructed from plywood, plaster of
Paris and many, many nails, each one standing at
exactly in the right spot and at the right population
potential height.2
In telling historical stories of social physics, and par-
ticularly of Warntz's work within that tradition, we are
not claiming that social physics is the equivalent to
what now passes as Big Data, or even that it is its
embryonic version. It is more complicated. The work
that Warntz did, as well as other social physicists on
whom he drew, contained some of the elements that
were later incorporated into Big Data via advance-
ments in spatial analysis, providing one of its proving
grounds, helping to shape its formulations and prac-
tices. Our larger point is that Big Data and its use in
geography didn't start de novo, from scratch, after the
rubble of the past was cleared away. It was erected on
that past, which consequently must be examined.
Historical foundations of social physics
In an early study, Sorokin (1928: 3) argued that the
intellectual foundation of social physics was the
Ancient Greek philosophical idea of monistic material-
ism in which ``psychical and social phenomena [were]
mere variations of natural phenomena.'' As a result,
regularities and laws found to hold for natural phenom-
ena applied equally as forcefully to social phenomena.
Natural and social worlds were isomorphic: one world,
one set of principles.
Monistic materialism, thought Sorokin (1928),
became especially important from the 17th century
with the beginning of the scientific revolution in
Western Europe. That revolution was defined in part
by the use of mathematics. Galileo famously said in the
early 17th century that the Book of Nature was
2 Big Data & Society
``written in the language of mathematics,'' and ``with-
out [it] one wander[ed] about in a dark labyrinth''
(quoted in Drake, 1957: 238). If society was isomorphic
to nature, it therefore followed that the social should be
written in mathematics too. That was what social phys-
ics did. It strove to convert all forms of society into
numbers, using mathematics to shed light on its own
dim labyrinthine corners. In some cases, leading scien-
tists also became leading social physicists. For example,
the English astronomer Edmond Halley (1656­1742)
turned his astrophysical skills in the early 18th century
to the life insurance business, using his mathematical
expertise to invent actuarial science by setting out stat-
istical regularities from a large-scale analysis of mortal-
ity data. In other cases, concern was with only the
social. John Graunt (1620­1674) sifted through statis-
tical data on disease, laying down an intellectual basis
for epidemiology. And Graunt's contemporary, Sir
William Petty (1623­1687), was the first to compile
national statistics of income and wealth, providing a
foundation for the ``dismal science.'' According to
Stewart (1950: 243), each of these three works of
large-scale numerical data compilation and analysis
represented early examples of ``social physics.''
Not that ``social physics'' yet existed as a name.
When it finally arrived, it was in French: ``physique
sociale.'' The Belgian astronomer, statistician, and
social tabulator Adolphe Quetelet coined the term in
1835 in his book Sur l'Homme.3 Specifically, Quetelet
assembled a large data set of Parisian crime figures,
subjecting it to a demanding social statistical analysis,
making scientific predictions of ``terrifying exactitude''
(quoted in Hacking, 1990: 105). He was able to do so
because, following the monistic line, he believed social
life was governed by statistical laws revealed by apply-
ing the methods of social physics.
Quetelet in his analysis drew especially on ``the
error curve'' (the Gaussian normal distribution) to
understand social regularities. Curiously, though, he
eschewed his own home discipline of astronomy to
provide other explanatory theories. But they came
from that subject in 1858, although not from a trained
astronomer, but oddly from a retired autodidact and
Philadelphia publisher, Henry Carey. Carey unabash-
edly believed in monism, writing that ``the laws which
govern matter in all its forms, whether that of coal,
clay, iron, pebble stones, trees, oxen, horses, or man
are the same'' (quoted in Sorokin, 1928: 13). But he
went further. His three-volume Principles of Social
Science applied Newtonian gravity formulations to
terrestrial human movement. Carey wrote that under
``the great law of molecular gravitation . . . man tends
of necessity to gravitate toward his fellow man
[sic] . . . . Gravitation is here, as everywhere else in
the material world, in the direct ratio of the mass
and in the inverse one of the distance'' (quoted in
Tocalis, 1978: 68).
But all of this was just a protracted warm-up for
what was to come. Beginning from the early 1940s
and continuing to the present, social physics bur-
geoned, drawing in research money, establishing insti-
tutional bases, fostering specialized workshops and
conferences, and launching its own journals as well as
thousands of academic papers. The current form of the
field, also called sociophysics or statistical physics, is
dominated by physicists (see, for example,
Battencourt et al., 2007; Gabaix and Ioannides, 2003;
Stauffer, 2004, 2013). They call what they do ``interdis-
ciplinary'': applying principles and methods of physics
to subject matter traditionally investigated by other
disciplines such as economics, psychology, sociology,
political science, and geography (Stauffer, 2004, 2013).
But the earlier mid-20th-century incarnation of
social physics, and this paper's primary concern, was
interdisciplinary in a different sense. It was constituted
by researchers from many different disciplines and
which, from the early 1950s, included geographers,
producing an explicit spatial analysis.4
Mid-century social physics
Only one of the two founders of the mid-20th-century
version of social physics was a physicist, John Stewart,
Professor of Astrophysics at Princeton. The other was a
linguist, George Zipf, who taught in Harvard's German
Department. From 1939, he was given a one-off pos-
ition of University Lecturer that allowed him free rein
to teach in the College any subject he wanted: he chose
social physics.
George K. Zipf
Zipf was fascinated, maybe obsessed, with numerical
patterns. He was originally appointed at Harvard's
Department of German. Strangely, though, his research
was not about that language but Chinese. It involved
taking 20 extracts of Chinese writing, each with at least
a thousand syllables, and generating in total 20,000
separate individual syllables (Rousseau, 2002: 12).
Carrying out a large-scale numerical analysis, making
use of student ``human computers'' to undertake the
calculations, Zipf found that the frequency distribution
of syllables conformed to the power law5
Pn
$ 1=na ð1Þ
where Pn
is the frequency of any given Chinese syllable
ranked n (all syllables are ranked in order of their fre-
quency of occurrence, with the most frequent ranked 1,
Barnes and Wilson 3
the second most frequent 2, and so on down to rank n);
and exponent a is almost equal to 1.
The power law finding perfectly catered to Zipf's
obsession. It implied a set numerical pattern in which
the second most frequent Chinese syllable occurred
approximately one-half as often as the first, the third
syllable one-third as often, and so on down the line.
Moreover, Zipf found that the same power law distri-
bution held in other languages too, and not only for
syllables but also for words and phrases (Zipf, 1932,
1968). In each case, the frequency of use of an element
of language was inversely proportional to the rank of
its frequency. In English, for example, Zipf found by
examining texts as different as the King James Bible
and James Joyce's Ulysses that ``the'' is the most fre-
quently used word in the language, which is twice as
common as the second most frequently used word,
``of,'' and three times as common as the third most
frequently used word, ``and.''
After Zipf was appointed as University Lecturer, he
took his original finding and in true social physics
fashion applied it to other social phenomena. In this
he was guided by his faith in monism. As he put it in a
1942 paper, ``the same natural law governs the structure
and behavior of our planet, of life on our planet,
and indeed, of even the smallest minutiae of living
activity including the most subtle emotional and
intellectual elaborations of the human mind'' (Zipf,
1942: 48).
His immediate work was on city-size distributions,
and published as National Unity and Disunity (Zipf,
1941). Resting on an enormous amount of data collec-
tion and analysis, making use of even more human
computers than for his studies of language, Zipf
found his power law formulation applied to city-size
distributions not only across different countries but
also over time as well. Further, when plotted on log
paper the power law distribution of city-size distribu-
tions took on a striking linear form, making the rela-
tionship even more beguiling (Figure 1). It established
that within a given urban system the second largest city
was half the size of the largest city, the third largest city
Figure 1. USA 1790­1930. Communities of 2500 or more inhabitants ranked in decreasing order of population size. Reproduced

a third of the size of the largest city and so on. Under
such conditions the total population of the entire urban
system was given by
X
N
n¼1
Pn
¼ P1 Á
X
N
n¼1
1=n ð2Þ
where Pn
is the population of the nth ranked city
(n ¼ 1 . . . N); and P1
is the population of the largest city.
Zipf called the right-hand side of equation (2) the
rank-size rule, which was later eponymously dubbed
Zipf's Law. For any given ranked city n, its population
was equal to
Pn ¼ P1 Á 1=n ð3Þ
Before his premature death from cancer in 1950 at
age 48, Zipf, through prodigious feats of data collection
and calculation, tried to show in his magnum opus,
Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort
(1949), that the power law he had found for word fre-
quency and city-size distributions applied to all phe-
nomena.6 He seemingly had no problem in showing
that it applied to countable things like populations of
cities, words used in English language publications
from Beowulf to T.S. Eliot, and the ``length of intervals
between repetition'' in Mozart's Bassoon Concerto
in Bb Major (respectively Zipf, 1949: 420, 123, 337).
But he also suggested that it applied even to more
tricky phenomena that one might think would resist
enumeration, such as ``the death wish,'' multiple per-
sonalities, and ``erotic substitute action'' (it is best not
to ask) (respectively Zipf, 1949: 240­241, 264­266, 269­
270). In each case, the power law holds because, as he
argued in his 1949 volume, that distribution is the
manifestation of the ultimate monist principle, lex par-
sionae, the principle of least effort (Zipf, 1949: ch. 1).
Zipf (1949: 1) contended that all parts of nature, and
consequently all parts of society, beat the most efficient
path to any given end, ``minimiz[ing] the total work that
[is] . . . expended in solving both . . . immediate problems,
and probable future problems [original emphases].''
That resolution always takes the form of the power
law distribution; it is the statistical manifestation of
the Principle of Least Effort.
Zipf's ambition was overweening. He thought social
physics ``could be applied to everything . . . down to and
including man's innermost dreams. The soul. . . offers a
perfectly legitimate problem to science'' (Zipf, 1942:
62). Those who resisted that end he termed ``verbal-
ists,'' who he thought should be excoriated, if not
suffer something even worse.7 Moreover, he believed
he was on a modern-day crusade: ``My dear John,''
he wrote to Stewart on 22 May 1949, ``the intellectual
battle of the second half of the twentieth century is on;
you and I are both in it up to our necks with no earthly
possibility of retreat (and there is no desire). I propose to
keep the canons barking.''8 He did until the day he died.
But his death was a half-century too early. He would
have been in computational heaven had he lived to
experience a world of Big Data. A world in which vast
amounts of social data were available to be sifted,
arranged, and analyzed, made to show the power of
the power law distribution and lex parsimonae, and
with neither a verbalist nor a human computer in sight.
Our suggestion is that Zipf's work in part prepared social
science, and geography in particular, for that very world.
John Q. Stewart
Even more important for the social physics movement
than Zipf, who was a loner, was John Quincy Stewart.
His work directly linked to geography, and he also had
on his side, at least for a time, some heavy-weight US
East Coast institutions and intellectuals including the
Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton directed by
Robert Oppenheimer, and Warren Weaver at the
Rockefeller Foundation that funded his social physics
project for four years (1949­1953). It was Stewart from
his Princeton base who energetically and systematically
constructed, maintained, and promoted social physics
as a new stand-alone discipline. Continually on the
look-out for new resources and allies, never missing
an opportunity for endorsement (for both his project
and for himself), he strove to turn social physics into a
new social science.
Stewart was a Princeton man through and through.
All his degrees were from there, and two years after his
PhD he was back as a Princeton professor. Initially
interested in matters extraterrestrial by mid-career his
research focus became increasingly earthly. It centered
on weather and navigation and, important for the later
story, led to the publication of a widely circulated
primer used in the US Army Air Force, Coasts,
Waves, and Weather for Navigators (Stewart, 1945).
Part of that same terrestrial turn was his interest
in models of population potential; that is, applying
ideas of gravitational potential to the geographical dis-
tribution of population. There are different ways to
interpret population potential, but perhaps the most
common is as a measure of the influence of a given
population at one location (j) on another location (i)
(Rich, 1980: 5)
vi
¼ Pj
=Dij
ð4Þ
where vi
is the population potential at location i, Pj
is
the size of the population at j, and Dij
is the distance
between locations i and j.
Barnes and Wilson 5
Equation (4) says that the population influence of
location j on location i is proportional to the size of
the population at j doing the influencing, and inversely
proportional to the distance between the two locations.
True to his roots, Stewart first applied this potential
equation to the geographical distribution of the
``Princeton family,'' that is, the 20,438 members listed
in the 1940 edition of Princeton University's Alumni
Directory.9 Devoting his 1939 ``Christmas holiday to
statistical study,'' and drawing on the ``vigorous assist-
ance of Philip Wilkie . . . [for] some of the computa-
tions,'' Stewart first measured the population
potential of every state in relation to New Jersey,
Princeton's home state. From that he worked out the
expected number of Princeton alumni for every state,
and compared that number to the actual count from the
Alumni Directory. Stewart found that expected and
actual numbers of alumni ``more or less'' lined up. It
showed him that potential models applied not only to
objects in the heavens but also to those down on earth
within the social field, thus fulfilling the promise of
monism; that is, a social physics one-size-fits-all theory.
Stewart subsequently expanded his inquiries, calcu-
lating total population potential for the US as a whole.
For any given location i, total population potential is
equal to the sum of all the individual potentials created
by populations found at every location j (j ¼ 1, 2, . . . N)
Vi ¼
X
N
j¼1
Pj=Dij ð5Þ
where Vi
is the total population potential for location i.
With total population potentials known for all loca-
tions i, an equipotential (isopleth) map can be con-
structed. Each line on the map connects all places
with the same population potential. Figure 2 shows
population potential isolines calculated by Stewart for
the United States for 1940. Population potentials are
especially high in the North East (NE), indicating the
considerable influence of the population on any given
location within that region, but it falls off markedly for
locations in the West until it rises again on the Pacific
Coast.
Drawing equipotential maps took an immense
amount of computational effort. That's why Stewart
had to give up his Christmas holidays in 1939, shackled
to log tables, slide rule, and Mr. Philip Wilkie. But by
the late 1940s help was on its way in the form of elec-
trical computation and cartographic production.

6 Big Data & Society
Stewart enlisted into his project Thomas B. Bissett, a
Princeton senior undergraduate electrical engineer, and
inventor of a nationally award-winning ``computing
device.'' Taking second prize at the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers' meeting at Pittsburgh
in April, 1949, Bissett's machine ``permit[ed] the rapid
drawing of contours of equipotential.'' As Stewart
described it, Bissett's was an analog machine that
``applies Ohm's law . . . to the computation of potential
of population (number of people divided by distance).
Threads attached to the scriber controls a set of
resistances as it moves.''10 Admittedly, Bissett's
machine wasn't of the same caliber as other contempor-
ary computers such as Jay Forrester's at MIT, the
``WHIRLWIND'' (Hughes, 1998), or John von
Neumann's at the Institute of Advanced Studies,
Princeton, the ``JOHNNIAC'' (Dyson, 2012), but it
was certainly more reliable and quicker than Stewart's
former standby of human computers.
By the summer of 1949, Stewart thought it was time
for both he and the world to lose the quotation marks
that usually accompanied the term ``social physics.'' He
approached a key post-war science manager and well-
known scientist in his own right, Warren Weaver, head
of the Division of Natural Sciences of the Rockefeller
Foundation, for funding to develop social physics as a
proper social science. Shannon and Weaver (1949) had
published that same year The Mathematical Theory of
Communication, which became a central text of the early
post-war period, linking science, mathematics, comput-
ing machines and society and according to Edwards
(1996: 203), enabling a ``complete statistical analysis of
human social activity.'' Weaver wrote back to Stewart,
``I am completely sympathetic with your approach.''
And best of all, he offered him a grant of $15,000.11
Stewart used the money to mount seven conferences,
as well as to help form in 1951 a Social Physics
Committee of 40 strong, associated with the
American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS), which produced its own bevy of spe-
cial sessions. Stewart also increasingly adopted the lan-
guage of ``isomorphism'' to describe the relationship
between natural and social sciences. In a paper he
gave in Boston at an AAAS meeting in December
1953 he suggested that ``isomorphism means reliable
item-to-item correspondence between two or more
fields which superficially may seem altogether dissimi-
lar. The fields are exhibited as more or less identical in
their patterns of concepts.''12 Of course, this was
another version of monism, and justification both for
more computation, data compilation, and mathemat-
ization within the social sciences, and further explor-
ation of points at which concepts from physics
corresponded to items and relationships within the
social world. In the December paper, Stewart was
emboldened to assert isomorphisms between thermal,
electromagnetic, and chemical energy and, respectively,
human meaning, feeling, and authority, as well as an
isomorphism between mechanical work (kinetic, elastic,
and gravitational energy) and decision-making.13
But it was all a bit too much for Weaver, who wrote
to him in 1953:
To search for isomorphisms between social phenomena
and physical phenomena is indeed an interesting idea.
The real question, however, is whether or not it is a
rewarding idea. It is interesting to suppose that there
may be entities, social values, which play in social
experience the same roles played by different forms of
physical energy . . . But it is hard for me to sense how
one can usefully assign quantitative measures to any
significantly wide range of ``values'' in the social field.
And when you link together such things as meaning,
feeling, authority, and decision-making, this sounds to
me like a very heterogeneous mixture.14
Stewart bristled at Weaver's use of ``interesting.'' It ``is
more than merely `interesting,''' Stewart wrote back.
He was also ``surprised'' that it ``sounds to you `like a
very heterogeneous mixture.'''15 The argument here
was around whether all social variables could, to use
Weaver's terms, be assigned ``quantitative measures.''
Weaver was sceptical, but Stewart bullish, in part
because of his faith in monism. Clearly, this same
issue continues into present discussions of Big Data,
which seem to have sided with Stewart rather than
Weaver.16 But on that occasion, Weaver held sway
because he controlled the purse strings. He told
Stewart that his Rockefeller funding would not be
renewed. Stewart needed more allies. And that's what
he got later that same year, 1953, when William Warntz
contacted him.
Macrogeography and William Warntz
The first communication between Stewart and Warntz
was about the Bissett. Warntz wrote to Stewart on
1 October 1953, to ask whether the ``ingenious electrical
computer designed and constructed by Thomas B.
Bissett . . . could be made available to him?''17 Warntz
was writing his PhD thesis at the University of
Pennsylvania using Stewart's population potential
model, trying to calculate equipotential lines. He
needed that machine. But unfortunately it was not on
hand. ``No Bissett available here'' replied Stewart,
adding with a mathematician's zeal, ``longhand compu-
tation is not so bad.''18 Possibly not, though. Warntz's
obituary writer, Donald Janelle (1997: 724), reckoned
that in completing his doctoral dissertation alone
Warntz undertook ``thousands of calculations to
Barnes and Wilson 7
derive population potential fields, all with a mechanical
adding machine.''
Although their first correspondence wasn't until
1953, Warntz had been a secret admirer of Stewart
for some time. Warntz began his undergraduate
degree at Penn in economics in 1940. But the war inter-
rupted his studies. In 1943, he enlisted in the US Army
Air Force, and trained as a navigator. In active service
from 1944, awarded several military medals, Warntz
served in a combat heavy bombardment group based
in East Anglia. Following a crash landing as Warntz
returned from a mission, he was sent to Cambridge to
recuperate. It was there, presciently given his subse-
quent involvement with Stewart and social physics,
that he read Isaac Newton's papers at the university
library, the site of the largest single deposit of such
papers in the world. After the war ended, Warntz
remained in the Army Air Force and was posted to
Gander at the Newfoundland Base Command for sea
search and rescue missions. In the base's small library
he found J.Q. Stewart's Coasts, Waves and Weather for
Navigators (1945), which was to change his life. The
book was primarily a how-to manual for navigators.
But in an appendix, and quite out of character with
the rest of the book (Warntz, 1984, 1, called it ``an
exotic chapter''; 1984: 1), Stewart ``could not resist
the temptation'' to write about his new interest in popu-
lation potential, likening equipotential lines to isobars
within a cyclonic system. Warntz later said that was his
``Ah-ha'' moment (Dow, 1973: 56), when ``social sci-
ence and the things I learned about meteorology and
navigation'' came together.19
Once Warntz demobbed in 1948, he quickly com-
pleted his Bachelor's degree in economics at Penn, did
also a Master's degree there, and in 1951 entered its
doctoral economics program, specializing in economic
geography. He was supervised by Lester Klimm, an
economist with an unlikely interest in location theory.
His dissertation, later published as Toward a Geography
of Price (Warntz, 1959a), deployed the potential model
to present a geographical analysis of price, empirically
illustrated using commodity statistics taken from the
US Department of Agriculture. The thesis involved
the construction of both an aggregate demand curve
derived from population potential estimates weighted
by income, and an aggregate supply curve obtained
from potential estimates of spatially varying produc-
tion levels of different agricultural commodities. The
intersection of the two curves determined the geog-
raphy of price.
After the initial contact about the Bissett in October
1953, Stewart invited Warntz to come to the Princeton
Observatory. They met on 3 December 1953, and the
rest is history, with Warntz becoming Stewart's staunch-
est ally. The timing could not have been better given
Weaver's rejection of Stewart's project earlier that
same year. It meant social physics got a second chance
with a new home, in a discipline with a well-established
provenance that came with a formidable institutional
structure that included both the American
Geographical Society (AGS) (where from 1956
Warntz was a Research Associate running his own ``spe-
cial program'' in social physics) and the Association of
American Geographers (AAG), which brought a large
prospective audience, so far untouched by social physics
but potentially ready to be converted.
But for this to happen in geography, things needed
to be shaken up. In an address to the Geography ses-
sion at the annual meeting of the National Council for
Social Studies in Pittsburgh, in November 1957,
Warntz said:
In our researches in geography and our contributions
to the journals of learned societies, I suggest the time
has come for some unruliness, for discomfiting the
feeble-minded, for treading upon the weak, and for
general impatience. The time has come to raise a
rumpus in geography.20
Warntz argued in that address that geography was get-
ting no respect either from ``the Ivies'' ­ Ivy League
universities like Harvard, which had shut down its
geography program nine years before ­ or from geog-
raphers themselves who since the interwar period had
pursued a parochial and prosaic version of their disci-
pline, concerned only with ``the immediate, the obvi-
ous, the microscopic, and the demonstrably
utilitarian.'' For Warntz, the discipline could be so
much more. But to do that, geographers needed to
think big, to practice ``macrogeography.'' He thought
macrogeography would attract ``the Ivies'' and bring
back to the discipline ``originality,'' ``erudition,'' and
``brilliant scholarship.''21
Predictably Warntz's conception of macrogeography
was uncompromisingly monistic. Warntz was fond of
repeating his own choice phrases, and there was no
phrase he repeated more often than ``social sci-
ence . . . and physical science are but mutually related
isomorphic examples of one generalized logic''
(Warntz, 1957: 422, fn. 1). That was the strength of
macrogeography; it embodied the ``one generalized
logic.'' That logic was of a single discipline: physics.
It meant geography becoming like physics. And if a
discipline failed to do so, as geography patently had,
then it would suffer; it had suffered. That's why a
``rumpus'' was necessary.
Warntz thought geography had gone wrong when it
turned to what he called microgeography, which was
``preoccupied with the unique, the exceptional . . . and
often the obvious'' (Warntz, 1959b: 447). It relied on
8 Big Data & Society
Zipf's dreaded verbalism, ``subjective description,''
such as ``a feeling for the area,'' ``the personality of
the region,'' and ``man-land relationship'' (Warntz,
1957, 420). Under this regime of verbalism, Warntz
said microgeography ``has been tried, found wanting,
and is justifiably being discarded.''22
Now was the time to make amends, to do macro-
geography ­ a geography unified with the ``one general-
ized logic.''23 Although Warntz coined the specialized
term macrogeography for his approach, it was nothing
other than social physics. The name macrogeography
served only a rhetorical function of making the project
palatable to geographers, adding nothing substantively
that wasn't already contained within Stewart's original
formulation. But the name did resonate with, and in
part was picked up by, other practitioners of spatial
analysis who also emerged in the mid-to-late 1950s
both inside and outside geography. Walter Isard's
Regional Science Department was founded at Penn
the same year Warntz finished his PhD therein 1955.
Social physics was incorporated at least into Isard
et al.'s (1960) tome on regional science methods, and
Warntz maintained an adjunct position in regional sci-
ence at Penn until 1966. Likewise there were various
linkages between Warntz and the work of proponents
of geography's ``quantitative revolution'' that occurred
around the same time. Particularly important were the
so-called ``Garrison Raiders,'' a group of graduate stu-
dents at the Department of Geography, University of
Washington, Seattle, who worked with a young faculty
member, Bill Garrison, who shared Warntz's dissatis-
faction with ``microgeography'' and who sought an
alternative in some form of spatial analysis.
Core to Warntz's spatial version of social physics
was the computational task of confronting big data.
In this he was fortunate, given that he and his macro-
geography came of age during a period marked both
by the rapidly improving power of machine-based
computation as well as by increasing access to those
machines. There would be no more cap-in-hand beg-
ging for the Bissett. In a paper, in the Geographical
Review, Warntz (1964: 171­172) directly linked the
development of macrogeography to computer develop-
ment. The issue turned on the number of so-called
``control points'' used to calculate a given population
potential map. A control point was a designated map
location associated with a particular population level.
Knowing those locations and population numbers was
necessary before any potential calculations could be
made and equipotential lines drawn. But the more
control points, and clear from equation (5), the
more gruelling the resulting calculations. In Stewart's
first 1940 set of population potential calculations there
were just 24 control points. Calculating for even that
relatively small number by hand, even with the
assistance of the energetic Mr. Wilkie, still took
Stewart all the Christmas holidays. Later Stewart
used Thomas Bissett's machine, but it could only
handle 10 control points at a time (Warntz, 1964:
177). The breakthrough was the arrival of the digital
computer. In 1958, Warntz and Stewart used ``an
early IBM electronic computer . . . [to] compute . . . a
map with 115 control points'' (Wantz, 1964: 171).
And by 1963, using Princeton's IBM 7090 computer,
Warntz was calculating the US population potential
using 3105 control points (one for every county in
the conterminous United States). Warntz (1964:
177­178) reports that in this case:
Inputs came from 3,105 punched cards . . . and [each
card] contained for each county . . . the 1960 popula-
tion, area, and geographical co-ordinates of the
county's population center . . . [A]bout ten billion arith-
metic operations were required to produce th[e] map,
and three other, different maps computed at the same
time. About twenty-three thousand words of stor-
age (thirty-six bit words) were required, and the program-
ming language used was Fortan . . . Running time for the
computer was a few seconds short of two hours.
Warntz also used the same computer for his 200 hour-
long, spare-time project of constructing a three-
dimensional physical model, 2 by 3¼ feet, of the 1960
US population potential map. It was for an AGS exhi-
bit, ``New York: An International City,'' at the 1964­
1965 New York World Fair (Janelle, 1997: 724).
Warntz had hammered into the base map 3105 individ-
ual nails, the exact height of each calculated by the IBM
7090.
Warntz's work impressed Howard Fisher, who in
1965 had founded the Laboratory for Computer
Graphics within the Harvard Graduate School of
Design (GSD), with the intellectual support of Brian
Berry of the University of Chicago and Waldo Tobler
of the University of Michigan (both geographers and
members of Bill Garrison's ``Raiders''). Fisher had
organized a series of luncheon presentations on the
state-of-the-art in the spatial representation of quanti-
tative information, to include Berry and Warntz.24 In
1966, Warntz was made Professor of Theoretical
Geography and Regional Planning (although without
tenure) within the lab (the first professor of geography
on Harvard's campus since Derwent Wittlesey's death
10 years prior in 1956). Fisher and Warntz's work
within the lab was two-fold, according to Warntz:
first, the ``continued investigation into the uses of graph-
ical analysis, and computer graphics in particular,''
of which Fisher no doubt led the effort, and, second,
``pure research in the framework of general systems
theory and spatial patterns,''25 much of which was also
Barnes and Wilson 9
lumped by Warntz as theoretical geography and pub-
lished within the Harvard Papers in Theoretical
Geography (edited by Warntz, 1966­1971).
As Fisher was due to retire in 1970, at the exhaustion
of the Ford Foundation grant that supported the lab,
Warntz became Director in 1968 and the name of the
lab became the Laboratory for Computer Graphics and
Spatial Analysis. In addition to his duties within the
Graduate School of Design, Warntz also led freshmen
seminars within Harvard and was even asked to submit
a proposal justifying the return of geography to the
university (Janelle, 2000: 105). Seemingly, macrogeo-
graphy really was what the Ivies wanted, with
Warntz's work representing qualities of ``originality,''
``erudition,'' and ``brilliant scholarship.'' In the end it
didn't work out, with geography never returning to
Harvard after all, and Warntz resigning his position
three years after he became Director (see Chrisman,
2006, for an excellent history of the Harvard lab and
Warntz's role within it). What Warntz did achieve,
however, was to prepare the ground of geography for
Big Data, providing models of spatial analysis, stressing
the importance of powerful computing machines, and
championing the belief that sooner or later the entire
social field could be turned into numbers.
Conclusion
The strategic positions of graphics and geometry
become even more clearly defined, while concomitantly
the distinction between cartography and spatial
mathematics decreases. (Warntz, 1977 [1967]: 5)
The engine that drives social physics is big data: the
newly ubiquitous digital data that is becoming available
about all aspects of human life. By using these data to
build a predictive, computational theory of human
behavior, we can hope to engineer better social systems.
(MIT Media Lab, 2014: n.p.)
Warntz's belief that numeracy held the key to spatial
problem-solving was yoked to his curiosity about spatial
representation as a means both to test hypotheses and to
realize solutions graphically. That ``we now look upon
maps not only as stores for spatially ordered informa-
tion'' but also as part of a three-segmented theoretical
geography of description, classification, and prediction,
complemented the efforts of the lab under Fisher, an
architect interested in assessing how computer graphics
would alter the conventions of thematic cartography. 26
And this predilection can be felt as the impulse of Big
Data, as can be seen in the materials for the new social
physics at the MIT Media Lab, ``to build a predictive,
computational theory of human behavior.'' While at
Harvard, Warntz worked alongside many of the leading
figures of what would become Geographic Information
Science, including Jack Dangermond (founder of Esri,
the company responsible for ArcGIS), and when he
resigned his position at the GSD in 1971 he was
appointed at the University of Western Ontario, where
Bill Bunge (another Garrison Raider and author of
Theoretical Geography) was serving as visiting professor
and where Mike Goodchild was beginning his academic
career in spatial analysis (and would later occupy the
Dangermond Chair of Geography at UC-Santa
Barbara).27
Big Data continues to vex GIScience, as can be seen
in the precipitous rise of volunteered geographic infor-
mation (VGI).28 A term coined by Goodchild (2007:
220), ``the most important value of VGI may lie in
what it can tell about local activities in various geo-
graphic locations that go unnoticed by the world's
media, and about life at a local level.'' The spatial ana-
lysis of these data inherits the affect, if not many of the
techniques, associated with social physics. As Anselin
and Rey (2012: 2211) write, the techniques associated
with current spatial analysis and their subfield of spatial
econometrics ``has roots in regional economics and
quantitative geography.'' Interestingly, this form of
macrogeography ­ to understand the spatial patterning
of Big Data ­ does not preclude attention to the micro
(in fact, it presupposes recording the rich details of pri-
vate life). Likely, Warntz would be pleased. While, per-
haps, there are other epistemologies that enroll Big
Data beyond the monism of data-driven methods (for
instance, Crampton et al., 2013), our curiosity is
increasingly piqued by the continuities of macrogeogra-
phy with some contemporary GIScience work, made
more conspicuous, we suggest, by the rise of Big Data.
Our suggestion is that we've been here before. That
the call to quantify and to represent social-spatial activ-
ity enacts a specific visibility that potentially renders
invisible other phenomena. Not everything can be
quantified, or only partially quantified. What's not
drops out of view. That was precisely the issue when
critics in human geography took aim at Warntz's social
physics version of the discipline during the 1970s. So-
called humanistic geographers argued that what
became invisible in Warntz's social physics was any
real, sentient human being, who could never be
described by numbers alone (Ley and Samuels, 1978).
Radical geographers such as Harvey (1972) thought
what dropped out were social relationships, power
inequalities, and class conflict ­ for them, vital to
understanding any kind of geography, large or small.
While these criticisms led to new forms of geography
emerging, the social physics kind continued, indeed
flourished, finding new applications and academic
homes, taking on new manifestations, one of which
10 Big Data & Society
we've argued was Big Data. That's the reason we need
to trace the connective tissues between Big Data and
the mid-20th century. Not to do so would be a mistake.
By showing that Big Data is historical, we show the
assumptions that were built into it, as well as the con-
testations around them. Big Data becomes no longer a
black box, self-contained, sealed and impregnable, but
is opened up, available for verbalist discussion and
contestation.
In 1967, Warntz provided a summary of the lab's
position with respect to the mathematization of
geography:
Description of surfaces and paths including geodesics,
spatial probabilities, central-place hierarchies in the
broadest sense are the types that seem destined to
replace the current arrangement characterized by spe-
cialties classified in terms of non-spatial properties and
including such things as population geography, linguis-
tic geography, cultural geography, economic geog-
raphy, and so on. We agree.29
What Warntz is trying to do here is monism: to say that
there is only one version of geography, the social phys-
ics kind, and all other kinds of geography are mistakes
that must be abandoned. That same monistic urge,
we've suggested, is also found in Big Data. We disagree.
But as verbalists, we would.

1. Isaac Newton (1642­1727) did not recognize gravitational
potential, but the Italian mathematician and astronomer
Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736­1813) did some 40 years
after Newton's death. He found that when several planets
were clustered gravitational attraction could be repre-
sented by a new coefficient, potential.

3. `Physique sociale'' was also chosen by August Comte
(1796­1857) in 1838 to describe his positivist project.
But the ``statistical study of people . . . [was] anathema
to Comte'' (Hacking, 1990: 39), and to ensure there was
no confusion with Quetelet, who he felt was a rival,
Comte plumped instead for what he thought was a new
term, ``sociologie.'' Ironically, it too had already been
coined in 1790 by Emmanuel-Joseph Sieye
` s.

of social physics, Stewart lists the full interdisciplinary
glory of the field: ``physics, chemistry, astronomy,

ence, history of science, engineering and invention, indus-
trial engineering, geography, sociology, psychology,
economics, history, law and jurisprudence, public rela-

5. Richard Wallace says Zipf had a ``room full of com-
puters to count words . . . . Each `computer' would
arrive at work and begin tallying the words and phrases
directed by Zipf.'' The computers, of course, were
humans, Harvard undergraduates dragooned into service
(available at: alicebot.org/articles/wallace/zipf.html;
accessed 8 January 2014). In addition, Zipf's son
Robert remembers also being collared into helping his
father complete his work, ``which required considerable
hand calculations in that pre-computer time'' (Pru
¨ n and
Zipf 2002: 3).
6. Zipf's colleague at Harvard, Clyde Kluckhohn (1950:
269­270) in his review of Human Behavior and the
Principle of Least Effort, commented on Zipf's ``stagger-
ing range of data. . .. To name only a few: number of
different news items in various American papers;
number of obituaries in the New York Times; charge
accounts of Jordan March Co., Boston; bus, rail, and
air passenger travel; telegrams exchanged between cities;
density of traffic in Milwaukee; claims against insurance
companies; marriage licenses related to residences of
applicants.''
7. Zipf wrote to Stewart in November 1949: ``I gather
that you too would like to hear lead pipes crunch on
verbalistic skills. We have indeed suffered much from
the verbalists. But being a peace-loving non-aggressive
soul, my only advice is, `Don't shoot the verbalist with
blank cartridges'.'' Zipf to Stewart, 12 November 1949,

16. The issue here is the relation of monism to Big Data. The
most immediate invocation of monism by Big Data is its
assumption that the social world can be mathematized in
the same way as the natural world. Just as Galileo
thought that the Book of Nature is written in the lan-
guage of mathematics, there is a parallel belief within Big
Data about the ``Book of Society.'' Without the suppos-
ition that the social world can be fully made over as num-
bers, Big Data would have no purchase. We also suggest
that monism is invoked by Big Data in a second form,
at least implicitly. When Big Data deploys models of spa-
tial analysis monism is presumed, because those models
partly rest on a social physics that makes monism
foundational.
