Introduction
Over the years, linguists have been wondering why some
students learn a second language more efficiently than oth-
ers. They have been wondering why certain individuals
quickly achieve native-like competency whereas others find
progressing beyond beginner proficiency levels highly chal-
lenging. The most commonly asked question in this context
is, "What is it that makes a second language learner strive
towards goal achievement?" To answer this question, current
theories of second language acquisition and learning need to
be examined. These theories are based on research in a wide
variety of fields, such as linguistics, psychology, sociology,
anthropology, and neuro-linguistics (Freeman & Freeman,
2001) and borrow from each other to address questions that
researchers have been trying to answer to provide guidance
to language teachers and policy makers.
Research has indicated that second language learning is a
social­psychological phenomenon, and it is important to
carefully consider the conditions under which it takes place.
Ellis (1997) argues that both internal and external factors
play an integral role in learning a second language. External
factors such as the social milieu in which learning takes place
include opportunities learners may have to hear and speak
the target language. Internal factors, however, include the
attitudes learners develop toward the target language and
seem to have a much stronger effect on language learning.
Saville-Troike (2006) claims that the question why some
learners are more successful than others leads to the exami-
nation of differences in the learners themselves. In this con-
text, numerous factors may be examined; however, this
particular research focuses on the individual differences that
language learners display in terms of language attitudes and

A Study of the Attitudes and Motivational
Orientations of Pakistani Learners
Toward the Learning of English as a
Second Language
Aamna Khalid1
Abstract
In Pakistan where different languages co-exist, and where English has a high status as a second language (L2), the learners'
attitudes toward English plays an important role in formulating effective language policies. It is essential that these policies
reflect these attitudes and are in sync with the learners' orientations toward learning English. This article aimed to examine
the attitudes of Pakistani students toward the learning of English as an L2 and to understand the motivational orientations
that result from their attitudes. A secondary objective of this research was to find evidence to support the claim that
Pakistani students are additive bilinguals who are not averse to the idea of a language policy that promotes English as
the medium of instruction. Sixteen-year-old Pakistani students from public-sector schools were interviewed and asked to
respond to questionnaires that measured their attitudes and orientations. The results indicated positive attitudes toward
learning English as a second language with a clear instrumental orientation. Hence, the study highlighted that there exist no
conflicting loyalties regarding the status of English and Urdu (the L1) and that both languages are held in high esteem. Despite
a strong desire to learn English to gain access to international markets, the status of Urdu remains secure as it is viewed as a
symbol of national integration. Hence, Pakistani students are additive bilinguals who for instrumental purposes would prefer
their medium of instruction to be English and not because they do not value their L1.

motivational orientations. These differences are most impor-
tant as they directly and indirectly influence the rate, process,
and efficiency of language learning.
Background of the Study
Pakistan with a population exceeding 199 million is as much
an English-speaking country as it is an Urdu-speaking coun-
try (Rahman, 1998). Urdu, an urban language of wider com-
munication, is the national language of the country whereas
English is the official language. English is the language of
the elite of Pakistan both formally--official interaction,
employment, education and so on--and informally (private
conversations, entertainment, reading, travel, etc.). It is
firmly entrenched into the Pakistani society and considered
to be a highly desired language by a vast majority of the pop-
ulation. Hence, English, today, enjoys a high status as the
language of education, law, government, science, and tech-
nology. It is interesting to note that although English enjoys
a high status and is a powerful language, Pakistan is a pre-
dominantly ESL (English as a second language) country.
Advocates of English argue for its retention as a language
for international communication and as a lingua franca
among the country's provinces. Some conservative groups,
however, see English as a symbol of Western culture and as
creating inequality among the English-speaking elite and the
common masses (Mansoor, 1993).
Over the last few decades, language policy makers in
Pakistan have tried time and again to oust English and to
replace it with Urdu as the language of government, law, and
education (Rahman, 1998). They have supported their claims
by labeling English as the language of the colonial masters of
the past when Pakistan was a part of India under British rule.
In their view, the younger generations do not hold English in
high esteem and have highly negative attitudes toward it
(Rahman, 1999).
Nevertheless, English is taught in all the schools, and is in
fact the medium of instruction in many institutions and has
been observed to be a language that the young students are
using in not just their school lives but also their private lives
(Rahman, 1998). Such contrasting scenarios have been pos-
ing numerous difficulties in language policy development
and in determining the status and role of English in the
Pakistani educational context (Rahman, 1999). Hence, it is
of relative importance that the dynamics behind the teaching
and learning of English are analyzed before any language
teaching or learning policies are formulated (Rahman, 1998).
Research Aims and Objectives
As has been discussed earlier, one of the most important
issues in the English learning and teaching scenario is that of
the learners' attitudes toward and their motivations for learn-
ing this language. To formulate effective language and edu-
cation policies, the study of these attitudes and motivations is
crucial so that policies and learner needs and motivations are
in sync for better language education in the country.
Consequently, it has been emphasized time and again that
"instrumental reasons for learning a language display a posi-
tive attitude towards one's own language as well as towards
the target language group" (Siguan & Mackey, 1987, p. 89)
as opposed to integrative reasons.
This research study attempts to prove this hypothesis to
better understand one of the most important variables that
affect the second language learning process in Pakistan. The
main reason why this variable is so important is that policy
makers have quoted integrative orientation as the key moti-
vating factor in the learning of English, hence showing that
Pakistani learners are subtractive bilinguals (Rahman, 1999).
These views are in direct contrast to the existing research in
this area (Abbas, 1998; Mansoor, 1993; Rahman, 1998,
1999). What has happened as a result is that the language
policies have been rendered rather unproductive and ineffec-
tive and so have adversely affected the second language
learning scenario (Rahman, 1998).
Thus, the main aim of this research study is to highlight
the learners' attitudes toward and their motivations for learn-
ing English to ensure that language and education policies
and learner needs and motivations are in sync for better edu-
cation in the country.
For this purpose, the article attempts to examine what
16-year-old Pakistani students feel about the learning of
English language. This understanding will benefit policy
makers as they try to develop sound educational policies.
Moreover, this article also aims to analyze the effects of
these attitudes on the motivational preferences of these learn-
ers; that is, this study also aims to identify and determine the
learners' motivational orientations.
Hence, the research objectives are as follows:
·
· To examine the attitudes of Pakistani students toward
the learning of ESL
·
· To understand the motivational orientations/prefer-
ences of Pakistani students by analyzing the effects of
the language attitudes that Pakistani students display
toward the learning of ESL
A secondary, yet important, objective of this research is to
find evidence to support the claim that Pakistani students are
additive bilinguals who are not averse to the idea of a lan-
guage policy that promotes English as the medium of instruc-
tion. Hence, this article is simply a starting point in the
much-needed research into the role and status of English in
the Pakistani educational scenario.
Language Attitudes and Second
Language Learning
Social psychologists claim that attitudes exert a directive
influence on behavior because someone's attitude toward a
Khalid 3
target influences the overall pattern of the person's responses
to that target. Triandis (1971) suggests that attitudes are
made up of three components: cognitive, affective, and cona-
tive; that is, what a person thinks and feels, and how he or
she tends to behave toward an object. These components are
often interdependent to a certain extent and interact dynami-
cally with the environment. Ryan and Giles (1982) present a
more language-focused view of attitudes as, "any affective,
cognitive or behavioural index of evaluative reactions
towards different language varieties or their speakers" (p. 7).
Similarly, Fasold (1984) maintains that attitudes toward a
language are often the reflection of attitudes toward mem-
bers of various ethnic groups. In addition, Edwards (1982)
contributes that an individual's reactions to a language vari-
ety reveals a great deal about his or her perceptions of the
speakers of that variety.
In a similar vein, Gardner (1982) suggests that if we know
a person's attitude toward the target language community,
that is what he or she thinks and feels about them, then we
have a better chance of being able to predict the way he or
she will behave toward them. This hypothesis has been the
basis underlying most of the research conducted into the
relationship among attitudes and Second Language
Acquisition (SLA), for example, Gardner and Lambert
(1959, 1972); Lukmani (1972); Oller, Baca, and Vigil (1977);
and Mansoor (1993). The crucial point in Gardner's (1985)
theory is, therefore, that a student's attitude toward the target
language group will influence how successful he or she will
be in incorporating aspects of that language. It is commonly
accepted among scholars that language belongs to a person's
whole social being: It is part of one's identity and is used to
convey this identity to other people. Thus, the learning of a
second language involves more than learning skills, or a sys-
tem of rules, or a grammar; it involves an alteration in self-
image, the adoption of new social and cultural behaviors and
ways of being, and therefore has a significant impact on the
social nature of the learner. Hence, Gardner (1985) hypoth-
esized that L2 learners with positive attitudes toward the tar-
get culture will learn the target language more effectively
than those who do not have such positive attitudes. In their
earlier studies, Gardner and Lambert (1959) found that apti-
tude and motivation were the two factors most strongly asso-
ciated with learners' L2 achievement.
According to Latchanna and Dagnew (2009) motivation,
attitudes and beliefs about learning a language are among the
determining factors that influence a student's efficiency and
must be taken into account when understanding second lan-
guage learning processes. Lennartsson (2008) postulates that
students' beliefs can be an obstacle if they believe that they
cannot learn the new language successfully. Hence, a negative
attitude and lack of motivation can lead to obstacles in learn-
ing a language (Lennartsson, 2008). In another vein, research-
ers have indicated that students' attitudes toward the specific
language group and attitudes toward learning it are bound to
influence how successful they will be in incorporating aspects
of that language--whether that influence takes the form of a
cognitive filter as suggested by Dulay and Burt (1977), and
Krashen (1981), or whether they simply support a student's
motivations (Gardner, 1985).
Hence, research has indicated that in second language
learning contexts, the role of attitudes and motivation is of
immense importance (Fishman, 1978). For example, in post-
colonial Africa, students may be educated in English or
French whereas another language is spoken in the home, and
yet another may be used in public encounters (Fishman,
1978). In officially bilingual countries such as Switzerland,
students use one language at home and for most schooling,
but are expected to acquire competence in at least one other
official language; thus, in Switzerland, French and German
are of equivalent social status and importance to success.
In the Pakistani community where different languages co-
exist, it is imperative to realize that language attitudes play
an important role in the lives of the users of these languages.
According to Grosjean (1982) "wherever languages are in
contact, one is likely to find certain prevalent attitudes of
favour or disfavour towards the languages involved. These
can have profound effects on the psychology of the individu-
als and on their use of these languages" (pp. 95-96) and
hence on the learning processes of these languages.
Therefore, how an individual views another language group
affects not only his or her reasons for learning that language,
but also his or her motivational intensity.
Motivation, Orientation, and Language Learning
When studying language attitudes, the concept of motives is
important. In the context of the study and in the domain of
social psychology, motivation is taken to be a construct with
three interacting components. These were identified by
Gardner (1985) as a combination of a desire to learn an L2,
the expenditure of effort to achieve L2 proficiency, and a
favorable attitude toward learning the target language. This
concept suggests that attitudes and motivation are important
because they determine the extent to which individuals will
actively involve themselves in learning the language.
Gardner (1979) further hypothesized that it is not possible
for an individual with an unfavorable attitude toward acquir-
ing a language to find the high drive, to invest the effort, and
to seek out opportunities required to learn. He further adds
that "attitude variables are important in that, they serve to
maintain levels of motivation . . ." (Gardner, 1985, p. 158).
Another concept of considerable importance in the field
of SLA deals with individual orientation, that is, the indi-
viduals' reasons for learning the target language (Siguan &
Mackey, 1987). It is easy to understand that motivation is
goal-directed behavior, and in this context, the goal is to
learn a language. The question that arises here is, why does
an individual have this goal--what is his or her orientation?
Early research into attitudes, motivation, orientation, and
their influence on SLA contrasted two types of orientation:
4 SAGE Open
integrative and instrumental. Mansoor (1993) has postulated
that integrative orientation is based on the desire to learn an
L2 to be able to meet, converse with, better understand, and
eventually be a part of the target language community.
Whereas instrumental orientation is based on a desire to
learn the L2 for essentially utilitarian reasons, such as getting
a good job or being better educated.
Gardner and Lambert (1972) proposed that an integrative
orientation leads to higher motivational levels and more suc-
cessful learning than instrumental orientation. This theory
has been modified by Lukmani (1972) and Mansoor (1993)
who have both proven that instrumental orientation leads to
more effective learning.
The Conceptual Framework of This Research
This research study rests on theories posited by Mansoor
(1993) in her extensive research on language attitudes and
motivations in L2 learning in Pakistan. As stated earlier, her
framework rests on the hypothesis that instrumental orienta-
tion leads to more effective language learning than integra-
tive orientation does. Mansoor's work stems from her careful
study of the social­psychological model proposed by
Lambert (1974 in Gardner, 1985). According to this model, a
learner's motivation to acquire a language is determined by
his or her attitude toward the target language group and by
his or her orientation toward learning the L2. Thus, Mansoor
(1993) analyzed learner attitudes toward a target language
group while trying to study the learners' attitudes and orien-
tations toward the learning of the said language.
This article also rests on Gardner's theory of second lan-
guage acquisition, where the crucial point to consider is that a
student's attitude toward the target language group will influ-
ence how successful he or she will be in incorporating aspects
of that language into his or her repertoire (Gardner, 1985).
Hence, the conceptual framework of this research study rests
on works by Lambert (1974, in Gardner, 1985), Gardner
(1985), and Mansoor (1993), with each work highlighting
that L2 learners with positive attitudes toward the target cul-
ture will learn the target language more effectively than those
who do not have such positive attitudes and that a strong
instrumental orientation is highly beneficial in this scenario.
The social­psychological model. In his seminal social­psycho-
logical model, Lambert (1974, in Gardner, 1985) proposed
that the learner's motivation to acquire a language is said to
be determined by his or her attitude toward the target lan-
guage group and by his or her orientation toward learning the
L2. The model is based on a theory of bilingual development
and self-identity modification. The theory suggests that lin-
guistic distinctiveness is a basic component of personal iden-
tity. This means that the development of L2 proficiency has
implications for the learner's self-identity and vice versa.
Lambert (1974, in Gardner, 1985) suggests that linguistic
distinctiveness originates very early in the socialization
process, occurring when parents make contrasts between their
own and other cultural communities to help their children
understand their social identity. Schools reinforce these early
perceptions. Consequently, language is seen to play a major
role in the development of an individual's self-identity.
Lambert (1967) argued that students learning a second
language must be able and willing to adopt aspects of behav-
ior that characterize members of the target linguistic­cultural
group. This involves both cognitive (language aptitude and
intelligence) and affective (attitudes and motivation) factors.
However, the stress is more on affective factors not just in
Lambert's theoretical model but also in this research; hence,
the discussion in this article will not focus on the role of apti-
tude and intelligence in second language learning.
Figure 1 displays the major components of this model.
The social­psychological model proposes that SLA is
mediated by a number of variables that include language apti-
tude and certain attitude and orientation variables, such as
ethnocentric tendencies, attitude toward the other language
community, and instrumental and integrative orientation
(Ellis, 1991). Moreover, as an individual becomes more profi-
cient in the L2, his or her self-identity may undergo a change,
which may lead to either additive or subtractive bilingualism.
It is important to note at this point that high motivation can
make up for considerable deficiencies both in one's language
aptitude and in learning conditions. In their seminal work,
Gardner and Lambert (1972) emphasize that, although lan-
guage aptitude accounts for a considerable proportion of
individual variability in language learning achievement, moti-
vational factors can override the aptitude effect. In certain lan-
guage environments, as Gardner and Lambert point out, where
the social setting demands it (e.g., when the L1 is a local ver-
nacular and the L2 is the national language), many people
seem to master an L2, regardless of their aptitude differences.
Attitudes Toward Language Groups
Spolsky (1969) argues that in a second language learning
scenario, one of the most important attitudinal factors is the
attitude of the learner toward the target language and toward
its speakers. A learner who has a positive attitude toward the

target language group will exhibit a stronger desire to learn
that language as compared with a learner with a negative atti-
tude toward that language.
According to Gardner (1985), the study of attitudes
toward languages and language groups includes issues such
as group-specific attitudes (attitudes toward language-speak-
ing communities; own ethnic community and other language
groups), attitudes toward languages (i.e., the mother tongue
and second languages), the extent of the use of all the lan-
guages in the repertoire of the individual, and how the func-
tions of the languages are being extended or restricted.
Ethnolinguistic identity. Ethnolinguistic identity is based on a
belief that one's own group is distinctive in socially impor-
tant ways (Lennartsson, 2008) and that the most important
component is cultural distinctiveness. The social identity
may be positive or negative according to how in-groups fare
in social comparisons with relative out-groups. In this way,
language functions as a very sensitive filter through which
one's own perception of self and group and others must pass.
Language maintenance, spread, and shift.Language shift and
maintenance are the long-term collective results of language
choice. In language shift, a community simply gives up one
language completely in favor of another--an effect of subtrac-
tive bilingualism (Cooper, 1983). Blommaert (2010) explains
that this could be the result of negative attitudes toward one's
language and a low ethno-linguistic identity. However, lan-
guage shift does not mean that knowledge of the forsaken lan-
guage has disappeared, but that the relative competence in the
two languages has become opposite to what it was earlier.
Cooper (1983) suggests that language spread occurs when
one language takes over others as a lingua franca and is used
for wider communication. On the whole, such spread is neu-
tral in attitudes when the spread is part of a natural process of
adding another language to the existing repertoire. However,
when the new language takes over as the mother tongue, the
language spread becomes a case of language shift. Hence,
positive attitudes engender language loyalty (Blommaert,
2010) and therefore favor maintenance of one's native lan-
guage. Cummins and Swain (1986) further maintain that
additive bilingualism is directly related to language mainte-
nance, whereas shift displays a subtractive attitude toward
the native language. Over time, intense subtractive bilingual-
ism could even lead to language loss or death.
The Research Scenario
This article outlines a small-scale research study conducted
to examine the above-mentioned theoretical concepts in the
context of the Pakistani school systems. A limited number of
participants were randomly selected--fifty-seven 16-year-
old Pakistani male students from English-medium govern-
ment (public) schools and the selected data collection tools
were administered over the course of a few days.
To minimize the effects of variables in the research situa-
tion, the participants were very carefully selected with
respect to their age ranges, socio-economic background, and
genders. The aim was to ensure minimum variations in terms
of ages, gender, and socio-economic class, hence enhancing
the study's reliability index.
Research Objectives and Questions
As has been discussed earlier, to formulate effective lan-
guage and education policies, it is crucial to study second
language learners' attitudes and motivations toward the tar-
get language. This will ensure that policies reflect learner
needs, attitudes, and motivations, and are hence, effective.
Thus, the main aim of this research study was to highlight
the learners' attitudes and their motivational orientations
toward learning English to ensure that language and educa-
tion policies and learner needs and motivations are in sync for
better language education in the country (refer to Table 1).
As stated earlier, a secondary objective of this study was
to find evidence to support the claim that Pakistani students
are additive bilinguals who display instrumental orientations
toward the learning of ESL. Thus, these learners are not
averse to the idea of a language policy that promotes English
as the medium of instruction (in direct contrast to what pol-
icy makers believe at the moment).
Limitations of the study. This research study was conducted as
a pioneering effort in the study of attitudes and orientations
of 16-year-old Pakistani students from public schools. It
aimed at opening the door to further research in this field,
hence, was small-scale and restricted to one city in the
country.
Another limitation of the study was related to data collec-
tion. Through the course of this study, it became evident that
policy makers were not accessible and unwilling to share the
reasons behind their views about the role and status of
English. It is rather important to be able to analyze their
views if an in-depth study of the role of language attitudes

Finally, this study was restricted to one socio-economic
group. A comparative analysis of the attitudes of different
socio-economic classes would have led to results that could
be generalized to a greater extent. However, as the objectives
of this research were to simply identify the basic attitudes
and orientations of students and to simply begin the process
of investigation in this domain, the participant group was
considered adequate.
Measurement of Attitudes and Motivation
While selecting the methods to collect data, it is imperative
to first address several issues in the search for dimensions
underlying language attitudes. First, the issue of prime
importance is to understand that the type of empirical proce-
dures used in deriving dimensions from rating scales contrib-
utes significantly to the ultimate result. Second, because the
attitudes toward different languages may vary quite dramati-
cally within a group, it is important to ascertain the critical
within-group characteristics and to investigate their interac-
tion with postulated attitudinal dimensions (Mansoor, 1993).
Therefore, an important method to use in this scenario is the
direct measurement technique, which observes language atti-
tudes through the use of questionnaires, either in written
form or via individual interviews (Ryan, Giles, & Sebastian,
1982).
Moreover, it is also important to remember that in a totally
indirect method of data collection, the participants are not
aware that it is their language attitudes that are being studied,
and hence, there are fewer chances of their responses being
colored by any biases. Thus, following Blommaert's (2010)
suggestions promoting the use of direct and indirect mea-
sures as a cross-validation technique, both direct and indirect
measures were used in this study to collect data.
Research Method
The most appropriate methods were selected after a critical
review of their advantages and disadvantages as enumerated
in Table 2.
Throughout the research study, the emphasis was on the
use of multiple data collection tools, thereby combining both
qualitative and quantitative methods. The research conducted
clearly depicted the many advantages of triangulation where
each source of data is seen to contribute an additional piece
to the puzzle and in that way complement each other (J.
McDonough & McDonough, 1997).
Patton (1990) claims that when investigating human
behavior and attitudes, it is most fruitful to use a variety of
data collection methods, as the researcher can build on the
strength of each type of tool and minimize the weaknesses of
any single approach. Thus, in the present research, the use of
both qualitative and quantitative methods in the form of survey
interviews and direct and indirect questionnaires provides
results that could be both statistically valid and theoretically
sound.
In relation to the advantages of using questionnaires,
Wilson and McLean (1994) postulate that questionnaires
provide structured data, are easy to administer without the
presence of the researchers, and are often straightforward to
analyze. In addition, the research interview provides impor-
tant qualitative data, and Patton (1990) suggests that when
interviews are structured and well organized, they are effec-
tive data collection tools.
Direct measures/self-reports. Bilingualism is measured either
by reported linguistic behavior by the bilingual speaker him-
self or herself either in questionnaire or interview form or
through observation (Hardford, Valdman, & Foster, 1982).
Reported linguistic behavior consists of background data of
self-assessment and of the results of measurements of atti-
tudes. Self-reports have often been criticized as being sus-
ceptible to extraneous variance (Ryan et al., 1982); however,
no empirical evidence has been identified to support this
claim. In fact, according to Hardford et al. (1982) self-assess-
ment of an informant's use of an L2 is a rather reliable
method of measuring bilingualism. Nevertheless, the success
of self-report techniques for eliciting information depends on
the openness and flexibility built into the questions (Aghey-
isi & Fishman, 1971).
Direct questionnaire (domain analysis).The collection of
background data is the easiest way of acquiring informa-
tion about the use of languages. In many investigations, the
background data show a fairly strong correlation with other
measurements of bilingualism (Mansoor, 1993). Macnamara
(1966) divides the background questionnaire into five cat-
egories, namely, "informant him/herself, father, mother, sib-
ling, and the environment" (pp. 85-87).
In this study, the survey used included statements related
to domains such as family, friendship, neighborhood, trans-
actions, education, government, and employment (refer to
Appendix B). The informants'task was to fill in the language

he or she most often used for each occasion (grading the fre-
quency of use from one to four--with four indicating the
highest frequency). The aim was to analyze their use of
English in different domains--both formal and informal.
Education, employment, and government were categorized
as formal whereas family, friendship, neighborhood, and
transactions as more informal domains.
This questionnaire was adapted from Mansoor (1993);
however, changes were made that were considered necessary
for the context of this research. The questionnaire (refer to
Appendix B) included open-ended questions to provide soft"
data about issues involved in the research.
Direct questionnaire (Likert-type scale).A well-known
direct measure is the Likert-type scale (Appendix C)--a
method of summated ratings. According to Dawes and Smith
(1985), a Likert-type scale consists of declarative statements
and a number of categories on which the respondents rate
their agreement or disagreement. The most common number
of categories is seven with a neutral category if required.
Appendix C presents a sample of the questionnaire based
on the Likert measurement scale. A total of 35 items were
selected, which aimed to provide a well-rounded view of the
participant's attitudes toward the target language. This ques-
tionnaire was adapted from Mansoor (1993).
Direct questionnaire (orientation index).The orientation
index in Appendix D was designed to elicit information
about the learners' reasons for studying English and to
determine whether their orientation would be classified as
integrative or instrumental. This measure was based on a
questionnaire developed by Gardner and Lambert (1972).
Six integrative and six instrumental reasons were randomly
ordered. The participants had to indicate the importance of
each reason by marking off one of five possible judgments
for each reason, ranging from "most important" to "not at
all important."
Semi-structured and open interviews.This measure con-
sisted of a number of prepared questions on the issue of
language proficiency and usage (refer to Appendix E). In
addition, the overall desirability of languages for education
was also considered. The questions were open-ended to give
a soft and qualitative dimension to the study. Although there
was a questionnaire format for the interview that was used
as the central core, some flexibility was allowed and the
research probed deeper into areas of interest especially the
role of language in education.
Indirect Identity Scales. Indirect Identity Scales were developed
by Spolsky (1969) to measure attitudes. Spolsky (1969) and
Oller et al. (1977) suggest that integrative­instrumental orien-
tation may be better measured by this technique that expresses
the concept of a continuum between the two orientations.
These Indirect Identity Scales were thought to provide an
indirect indication of a student's attitudinal orientation. Oller
et al. (1977) suggested that if a student rates a certain trait
more highly on the ideal self-scale, it indicates a positive valu-
ation of that trait.
Indirect questionnaire (identity scales). The Indirect Iden-
tity Scale used in this study consisted of four identity
scales, namely, ratings for self-concept, ideal self-concept,
the Urdu-speaking community, and the English-speaking
community. Each part had the same set of 17 traits on a
Semantic Differential Scale (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum,
1957). Participants were required to mark the bi-polar traits
on a 5-point scale. To protect against order effects, the traits
were randomly ordered on the page, with a different order
for each of the parts, so that participants would be forced
to respond to each part separately. Negative and positive
traits were also counterbalanced in the two columns (refer
to Appendix A). This questionnaire was adapted from Man-
soor (1993).
Validity and Reliability of the Surveys
A meaningful data collection instrument is one that is both
reliable and valid. One of the simplest tests of reliability is
whether the same questionnaire, administered to the same
person twice in a short period of time, yields similar responses
(Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2000). Belson (1986) asserts
that consistent responses suggest reliability, and consistent
responses to different items that seek to measure the same
behavior provide greater confidence that the questionnaire is
reliable. According to Cohen et al. (2000), the issue of the
degree of unreliability can also be reduced by using a variety
of measuring devices and assessors.
Tests of validity ask whether the interpretation, uses, and
actions based on assessment results are appropriate to the
purpose and context of the research (J. McDonough &
McDonough, 1997). A data collection item is valid to the
degree that it actually measures what it claims to measure.
To ensure reliability and validity in this study, not only
numerous data collection tools were used (triangulation), but
these tools were also tested in a piloting stage. Before the
surveys were administered to the participants, the surveys
went through a rigorous process of reliability and validity
checks with a control group of participants.
Procedure of the Research Study
The participants were randomly selected and were given a
preliminary explanation of the purposes of the study before
the data were collected in two sessions. The Identity Scales
and domain analysis questionnaires were completed in the
first session. An interval of half an hour was given between
the two sessions, to set off the "fatigue effect."
In the second session, the participants completed the ori-
entation index and the Likert-type scale questionnaires. After
8 SAGE Open
another 15-min break, 10 students were randomly selected
for the interviews.
Findings and Discussion
The results of the research study addressed both research
questions and clearly highlighted the language attitudes and
orientations of Pakistani second language learners.
With respect to the use of language, the results indicated
that all the learners belonged to lower-middle income groups
and shared a common first language, that is, Urdu. It was
found that the participants used a blend of Urdu and English
in informal settings, whereas English dominated all of the
formal communication (refer to Table 3).
One of the most important findings was that the study
revealed highly favorable attitudes toward English and the
English-speaking community. These were observed on both
the direct and indirect measures as discussed below and indi-
cated positive attitudes toward the learning of English.
A comparative analysis of attitudes toward the Urdu-
speaking and the English-speaking communities indicated
that the English-speaking community was rated lower than
the Urdu community by 90% of the learners. This directly
contradicts the assumptions of Pakistani policy makers who
claim that because of the use of English, Pakistani students
have developed a subtractive attitude toward their native lan-
guage (Rahman, 1998). This research revealed that although
Pakistani learners hold highly favorable attitudes toward
English, the positive attitudes are not at the expense of Urdu.
Recent research conducted by Islam, Martin, and Chambers
(2012) has also disproved the older views that Pakistani stu-
dents feel Urdu to be at risk if English is to be promoted not
only as a medium of instruction but also as a compulsory
subject from Grade 1 onward.
Regarding specific traits, the Urdu-speaking community
was rated considerably higher on integrative traits such as
"interesting, confident, reliable, capable, socially graceful,
open and most similar to self." The traits on which the
English-speaking community was rated higher were mainly,
instrumental ones such as "modern, successful, independent,
happy, high standard of living, bright future, and impres-
sive." Thus, this research corroborated findings from Norton
and Kamal's (2003) study that young Pakistani learners con-
sider competence in English to be closely related to
technological advances and developments in literacy in the
future and consider English education to be desirable and
highly beneficial from an instrumental perspective.
From this discussion when we try to determine whether
Pakistani students are additive bilinguals or subtractive, it is
rather obvious from the results that the majority display addi-
tive tendencies. Our students value English for its utility and
assign it a high status but not at the expense of their first
language.
The questionnaire that measured the students' attitudes
toward learning ESL (Appendix C) further reinforced the
finding that Pakistani students are additive bilinguals with
very positive attitudes toward both English and Urdu (the
national language).
Refer to Table 4 for the results of the questionnaire.
The results indicated that the participants agreed 100%
that proficiency in both Urdu and English is an advantage.
Although they all believed that proficiency in English is
advantageous and important, a vast majority felt more com-
fortable using their first language in everyday situations.
Hundred percent of the participants claimed that they
strongly identified with their mother tongue, first language,
and culture. This, among other things, proved the hypothesis
that although Pakistani students value English, they are
nonetheless additive bilinguals.
As for their views about the importance of Urdu, the
results clearly indicated that all of the students believed in
promoting Urdu to preserve their culture and felt that the use
of Urdu should be promoted throughout the country as it had
a strong role to play in the development of Pakistan.
With respect to attitudes toward the English community
and the learning of English, the research indicated that the
students had highly positive attitudes. Eighty to ninety per-
cent of the students strongly agreed that proficiency in
English had direct positive influences on getting a good job
and succeeding in their professional lives. Yet, the majority
disagreed when asked whether English should always be
used in everyday life, on public signs, notices, and advertise-
ments. The students were of the opinion that in all these
spheres of life, their national and regional languages should
be used.
It was interesting to note that although English was
assigned such a high status and given so much importance by
the students, 90% of the students strongly disagreed when
asked whether they identified with the values and culture of
the target language community. They agreed that English has
been and continues to be advantageous for Pakistan, yet it
does not make up a significant part of their history and iden-
tity. Thus, learning English is undertaken purely for utilitar-
ian purposes.
Hence, one of the most important findings was related to
the high status that most students assigned to English and its
utility in their lives. English was seen as useful in all spheres
of life, especially in professional life (refer to Table 5). The
students revealed that English is regarded as a status symbol

in Pakistan and acquisition of English is seen as necessary
for social prestige. In the Pakistani culture, social prestige is
synonymous with speaking English and being educated in
English. This takes the discussion to another area--that of
the preferred medium of education. However, this will be
discussed later. Overall, most students regarded English as
"a passport to progress and success."
Results on the orientation index and the other direct ques-
tionnaires revealed that all learners were more instrumen-
tally motivated than integratively motivated to learn English.
The students scored an overall mean score of 4.222 on instru-
mental reasons and 3.132 mean score on integrative reasons;
thus, the instrumental scores were higher. When a t test was
run on the orientation scores, instrumental orientation was

again found to rank significantly higher than integrative ori-
entation, that is, t = 5.44 at the .05 level of significance.
The most important instrumental reasons were as follows:
"it is the working language of my future career," "reading
advanced technical literature," and "travelling abroad" (refer
to Table 6).
The two integrative reasons with the lowest scores for
learning English were "thinking and behaving like the
English-speaking community" and "being friendly with the
English-speaking community." This displays little or no
desire on the part of the learners to identify themselves with
the English community or to integrate with them at the
expense of their own community and identity. When the rea-
sons for the low scores were analyzed, it was revealed that in
the students' views, these reasons imply a clear rejection of
the norms of Pakistani society and question their loyalty to
their own community, which the students find quite
unacceptable.
One of the secondary purposes of this study was to ana-
lyze the issue of the medium of instruction in Pakistan.
Research has shown that in the past, English as a medium of
instruction was considered to be a luxury reserved for the
higher income sectors of society (Rahman, 1998). The
medium of instruction for public and government-run
schools was Urdu, and the students viewed English-medium
instruction as a betrayal of their native culture and values
(Mansoor, 1993).
More recent works (Memon, 2007; Rahman, 2002, 2004),
however, have indicated a shift in this attitude. Because
English has gained popularity as a language for develop-
ment, attitudes have changed with respect to its purposes. It
is no longer seen as a language that will lead toward a shift in
the status of Urdu but as a language that is necessary to prog-
ress in the world (Islam et al., 2012).
Hence, its role as a lingua franca has led to a shift in the
attitudes of policy makers who earlier regarded English-
medium education as a threat to national integration and
development (Shamim, 2011). Policy makers, following in
the footsteps of Pakistani students, are just now beginning to
see the value of introducing English as a medium of instruc-
tion in public and government schools.
This research study also indicated this trend toward
English-medium instruction. The students displayed highly
positive attitudes toward English as a medium of instruction.
They were of the view that a change from Urdu-medium to
English-medium education does not indicate any negative
attitudes toward Urdu or a lowering of its prestige. This
change, according to the students, is simply a necessary
requirement if Pakistani students are to compete on an equal
footing with the students from the rest of the world. This will
automatically be advantageous to Pakistan as English may
be a powerful vehicle for promoting dialogue, unity, and
reduction of the divide between developed and underdevel-
oped countries (Islam et al., 2012).
Figure 2 depicts the opinions of the participants with
respect to the case of the medium of instruction. As is evi-
dent, a larger percentage of students preferred English as a
medium of instruction over Urdu. The vast majority, how-
ever, indicated that schools should provide students with a
choice between selecting Urdu or English as a medium of
study. This would empower students, and they would feel
that their opinions matter to policy makers.

It is essential to note at this point that when students pre-
ferred being given the opportunity to choose their medium of
study, 80% of them indicated that they would choose English
over Urdu. This simply reinforces the finding that English is
now the preferred medium of instruction.
Table 7 highlights the reasons that the students presented
for preferring English over Urdu as a medium of instruction.
Other than the obvious reason regarding the status of English
as a lingua franca and its role in opening doors for future
opportunities for the students, the interviews revealed that
students have other reasons for their preference. The students
listed numerous difficulties in Urdu-medium studies, mainly,
lack of materials and untrained teachers, and less access to
valuable literature and developments in various walks of life
(refer to Table 7).
Finally, the results implied a language spread in the case
of both Urdu and English.
In most cases, it was observed that English was used dom-
inantly along with Urdu in both informal and formal spheres
of life. Therefore, the L1 is being maintained even with rapid
spread of the L2, namely, English.
An important factor in the case of the spread of English is
the high status it enjoys. It has been the second official lan-
guage till 1972 and is used along with Urdu for all official
purposes (Rahman, 1998). It is seen as necessary for upward
economic and social mobility and as a symbol of progress
and modernization.
The study revealed another very interesting finding
related to the status and role of English in Pakistan and the
subsequent attitudes of students toward the learning of
English. Research has indicated that in countries where
English is a foreign language, the nature and strength of the
citizens' affiliations for their own country may have
consequences for their motivation to learn English (Islam
et al., 2012). In Japan, for example, Rivers (2011) found
significant correlations between nationalism and positive
attitudes toward learning English. These results can be
explained in terms of the belief of many Japanese that
English is an important tool for internationalizing their
country while also asserting Japanese distinctiveness in the
world outside. Similar research in China also suggests that
a possible motivation to learn English is the perception that
it may play a vital role in promoting Chinese identity and
culture to the world (Orton, 2009). In addition, Al-Haq and
Smadi (1996) found that Saudi Arabian students do not
consider English to be a threat to their national identity or
religious commitment; rather, they see learning English as
a religious and national duty because the language could be
used to promote and spread their cultural and religious
beliefs.
In Pakistan, most of the research leans in the opposite
direction where English is seen as a threat to national inte-
gration and as the main reason behind the decline in the pop-
ularity of the national language leading to a negative shift in
the status of Urdu (Haque, 1993). This is in direct opposition
to the findings of this research and the perspective put forth
by Shamim (2011) in her research studies where she describes
a widespread perception of English as the language for
development at both the individual and national levels, which
has "overtaken issues of class, identity, and fear of cultural
invasion from an erstwhile colonial language" (p. 293).
Recent progressive political leadership has called knowledge
of English "an urgent public requirement" (Jalal, 2004, p. 24)
on democratic grounds, and a new English language policy
has recently instigated the teaching of English from Grade 1
in most public schools in the hope of promoting the language
among the less privileged groups studying in public-sector
institutions (Shamim, 2011). What is required now is a pol-
icy where English gets the status of a medium of instruction
in all public schools.
Overall, the study revealed that Pakistani students display
a positive psycholinguistic distinctiveness. The learners
seem to strive to achieve a positive identity by not only seek-
ing dimensions that afford favorable comparisons with out-
groups, but regard their own language as something worth
having, and as necessary for their national identity.
Implications and Recommendations
According to Mueen (1992), countries have two dimensions
of language policy: first, to spread their languages to as many
people and groups as possible, and second, to learn foreign
languages to secure their national interests through diplo-
macy, intelligence gathering, trade, and so on. Hence, lan-
guage policies should be formulated after in-depth research
into the language needs and attitudes of the populace to
ensure that both attitudes and policies are in sync for effec-
tive results (Mueen, 1992).

12 SAGE Open
Research into the language situation in Pakistan has
shown a mismatch among the attitudes of Pakistani students
toward the languages in their repertoire and the language
policies that exist in the country (Haque, 1993).
The role of English in Pakistan has been studied by
Anjum Riaz ul Haque (1993), Shemeem Abbas (1998),
Sabiha Mansoor (1993), and Tariq Rahman (1998, 2002).
The first two writers merely touch on the role of English in
the country in their survey articles. Sabiha Mansoor, how-
ever, has conducted two major studies on the attitudes of
students toward languages. Her surveys suggest that stu-
dents have a linguistic hierarchy in mind with English at the
top, followed by Urdu and their mother tongues. She found
that English is associated with modernity, efficiency, and as
a means for future advancement (Mansoor, 1993). Her
studies have revealed positive attitudes toward English, not
just as an important second language to excel at but also as
a medium of instruction. Hence, English is seen as a means
for empowerment both at the personal and professional
levels.
Mansoor's (1993) research and Rahman's (2002) studies
along with this research have clarified that young Pakistani
students not just view English as the sole means of empower-
ment but also value Urdu and agree on its role in numerous
areas of importance in personal and professional lives--they
are hence, additive bilinguals.
This is another interesting revelation that this study high-
lights. Pakistani students are clearly additive bilinguals, as
their first language Urdu, a highly valorized language, is
given a great boost in the country for the purposes of national
integration, and learning a second language (English),
another highly valorized language, poses no threat to their
L1 or language community.
The misinformed policy makers have been trying to oust
English as the official language and to replace it with Urdu
(Abbas, 1998). They have based this action on the claim that
Pakistani students feel that English is a threat to their national
identity and integration. According to these policy makers,
students view the spread of English as a sign of language
shift with respect to Urdu (Abbas, 1998). They have deliber-
ately, or through ignorance, not realized that the Pakistani
students understand and respect the role of English in their
lives. Students now do not view English as the weapon of the
elite used to create divisions in society but as a tool that will
in fact bridge the gap between the well-educated,Westernized
urban elite, and the common masses of students who are
equally brilliant but suffer nonetheless in the job market
because of their lack of proficiency in English (Memon,
2007). These students believe that through the study of
English and in the medium of English, such disadvantages
could be eliminated. The students from public-sector schools
and universities could come up to par with the private school
students with respect to language skills (Memon, 2007).
There exists no doubt in the minds of students that English,
being an international lingua franca, is the key to accessing
better professional opportunities.
Another myth undermined by the results of the study is
that Urdu should be the sole medium of instruction as English
is harmful to Urdu. In fact, the study revealed highly positive
attitudes toward English as a medium of instruction. Students
are in favor of English-medium education because they feel
that many more doors will open for them if they were to study
in a language that is now the language of international mar-
kets. Research has indicated that there exists great discrimina-
tion between Urdu-medium and English-medium students
regarding job opportunities (Abbas, 1998), and the attitude of
the employer displays a clear bias in favor of English-medium
students (Memon, 2007). Hence, English-medium study will
ensure that students from the public sector are on an equal
footing with students from private English-medium schools
and will have access to the same opportunities and will not be
left behind. Hence, it is a tool for social mobility.
This in no way means that these students do not wish to
study Urdu or that they value it less. This research has clari-
fied that students believe Urdu to be a part of their national
identity and agree to its high status and important role in life
and that English is in no way a threat to Urdu.
Thus, the study shows that there are no conflicting loyalties
regarding the study of English and Urdu. Despite the strong
desire to learn English for instrumental reasons, the status of
Urdu remains secure. Urdu is seen as a symbol of national
integration, and all the learners display integrative attitudes.
Hence, the study points out that students want bilingual
education; that is, they want to study both English and Urdu
to fulfill different needs. Urdu is hailed as a symbol of
national identity, and English is desired because of its great
instrumental value in higher education, international com-
munication, and economic gains and progress.
Conclusion
It has been evident that the attitudes of Pakistani students have
changed radically from ambivalence and hostility to English as
a symbol of colonial rule during the first few decades after inde-
pendence, to an enthusiastic acceptance of English today.As far
as English is concerned, the "colonial hangover" (Rahman,
1999, p. 155) is over. Not a single learner in the study rejected
English on the basis that English is the language of the colonial
masters--the English people. The findings lend support to
Kachru's (1986) observations that the "colonial association of
English and its Western cultural values are now underempha-
sised. Instead what seems to be stressed is the power of English
as an instrument of individual and societal transformation"
(p. 110). This research showed that English is now considered
the language of globalization and considered essential for an
individual eager to enter the international market.
As stated earlier, language policies despite trying their
utmost to oust English and replace it with Urdu have failed
because of the positive attitudes of the students toward
English (Rahman, 1999). The students want English educa-
tion and feel cheated if they are deprived of it. Hence, English
should not be the monopoly of the elite private school
Khalid 13
students but should spread out to the masses as a tool for
empowerment. Thus, policy makers should not feel threat-
ened by its existence and in fact use it to further the cause of
Urdu as the language of national integration.
In addition, policy makers should promote the concept of
additive bilingualism and in fact try and eliminate any atti-
tudes that may hinder the spread of English. Only then will
the attitudes and needs of the students be in sync with the
policies. Thus, policies will finally prove beneficial to the
students, making the education process more effective.
In light of the research, it may be suggested that language
planning in Pakistan should aim at "cultural pluralism," rather
than "assimilation," which recognizes the cultural and social
diversity of different language groups, but which nevertheless
seeks to create a political and economic unity for them (Haque,
1993). Based on the study, a two-language formula catering to
the different needs of the learners appears to be suitable: (a)
Urdu for national identity and as a link language, and (b) English
as a world language and as a language for development.
Very positive attitudes toward Urdu indicate that it is suit-
able as a national official language for integrative reasons.
However, the great instrumental need for English makes it
suitable for a second official language. As a result, bilingual
educational programs should be introduced and followed,
where an option is provided to the learners regarding the
choice of the medium of instruction.
To promote additive bilingualism, it is recommended that
education be initiated in the national language as well as in
the L2 simultaneously. The bi-literate bilingual program
defined by Fishman is recommended as most appropriate
and useful in this Pakistani context. This group maintenance
program would encourage a stable bilingual community
(Fishman, 1972).
Finally, a detailed larger scale study into the attitudes, ori-
entations, and the motivational intensity and achievement
levels of Pakistani students is recommended to shed more
light on this important issue. This will result in gathering
data that will assist in drafting workable language and educa-
tional policies.
It is common knowledge that the education system in
Pakistan is in a crisis--for numerous reasons--but many
aspects of this crisis are directly related to the language poli-
cies (Mueen, 1992). A clear language policy that aims to pro-
mote the learning of English for instrumental purposes will
be the right step in the direction of resolving this crisis.
It is important to remember that the aim here is not to
replace one language with another but to adopt a better
approach of a parallel language system, with the caveat,
however, that the roles of these languages be demarcated
and defined to avoid any instances of dominance of one
language over another leading to a language shift. Hence,
we need a policy that removes the communication impasse
and creates an egalitarian society to have equal rights of
education, employment, and good living just as illustrated
by the views and attitudes that the students in this study
displayed.
