Background. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine that has been shown to increase with age.
Methods. Plasma IL-6 was measured by ELISA in 1,727 community-dwelling elderly subjects whose blood was
drawn during the third in-person survey of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE). Demographics, functional status (disability), and disease states were determined. Correlations of these fac-
tors with IL-6 were analyzed with Spearman's Rho while differences between groups were assessed by Wilcoxon test.
Results. IL-6 levels were higher with age (p = .0001) even in this older population (>70 years). There was a positive
correlation between IL-6 and functional disability for each of the functional status measures (p = .0001), as well as a
correlation between self-rated health and IL-6. Significantly higher median levels of IL-6 were found in subjects re-
porting prevalent cancer, heart attack, and high blood pressure, but not diabetes or arthritis. The association between
age and functional status with high IL-6 remained when all other variables were controlled, in multivariable analysis.
Conclusions. This association between increased plasma IL-6 levels and functional status suggests that dysregula-
tion of IL-6 may be related to the functional disability seen with aging, and that IL-6 may be useful as a component of
an overall marker of health.
rT"'HERE is a growing body of evidence that a network of
A cytokines plays an important role in the regulation of a
variety of physiologic functions (1,2). IL-6 is one such cy-
tokine that has been shown to be multifunctional in nature
but whose main.role appears to be the induction of the
acute inflammatory response and the induction of B-lym-
phocyte proliferation and differentiation (3,4). It also ap-
pears to play a role in the regulation of protease inhibitors
and modulation of bone resorption (5).
Under usual circumstances, in the absence of an inflam-
matory condition, expression of IL-6 appears to be tightly
regulated, with very little IL-6 detectable in plasma. IL-6
has been reported to be elevated in a number of age-related
diseases such as B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma,
Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis (6). However, a
number of studies have now demonstrated that, with in-
creasing age in both animals and humans (7-14), IL-6 in-
creased to measurable levels even in the absence of signifi-
cant disease. This has led to the suggestion that IL-6 is "a
cytokine for gerontologists" (15), which may be related to
some of the manifestations of aging in addition to the
emergence of some age-related diseases. These previous
studies, however, involved small numbers of subjects and
have precluded further exploration of possible factors asso-
ciated with the emergence of detectable IL-6 in elderly in-
dividuals, or disorders caused by or resulting from it.
In this study, we had the opportunity to measure IL-6 lev-
els in more than 1,700 subjects in a community-based popu-
lation of diverse racial and gender composition, as part of
the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiologic Stud-
ies of the Elderly (EPESE), concomitant with extensive col-
lection of survey information on demographic, social,
health, and functional conditions (16-18). This has allowed
more detailed analysis of the relationship between the level
of IL-6 with age, sex, race, self-reported medical condi-
tions, and functional status in the largest community-based
sample of this type. We confirm the finding that IL-6 contin-
ues to increase with age even in people over 70, and is asso-
ciated with some specific disease states. We demonstrate for
the first time a specific association with measures of func-
tional status (i.e., personal self-care activities). These obser-
vations have implications for our understanding of the role
of such cytokines in aging and the diseases of old age.
METHODS
Subject Population
Our subjects were from the Duke component of the
NIA-funded study of the Established Populations for Epi-
demiologic Studies of the Elderly. The populations of both
the overall four-site study and the Duke study have been
described in detail (16-19). Briefly, the Duke study en-
rolled 4,164 subjects aged 65 years and older at onset in
1986, selected on the basis of random household sampling
in a five-county area, including and adjacent to Durham,
North Carolina. The sample was selected specifically to
allow for comparison by racial groups. The initial in-person
survey included extensive information in many spheres in-

eluding: cognitive and functional status, nutrition, depres-
sion, life satisfaction, exercise, social interactions and func-
tioning, presence of chronic health conditions, and drug and
medical care use. In each following year, either a telephone
or in-person follow-up survey was conducted. At the third
in-person survey in 1992, or year 6 of the study, blood sam-
ples were drawn for a variety of routine hematologic and
blood chemistry determinations. In addition, a separate
sample was drawn for a substudy of inflammatory and co-
agulation factors. IL-6 measurements were performed from
this sample. This survey collected information on the same
spheres as the initial in-person survey, using several scales
measuring functional health status, defined as the level at
which a person performs the tasks and roles of daily life
(20). Information from several scales indicating levels of
functional status are reported because they measure differ-
ent aspects of function, thus in aggregate providing a com-
prehensive view. The Katz ADL (activities of daily living)
measures activities such as bathing, toileting, dressing, eat-
ing, and grooming; the Rosow-Breslau Scale measures
doing heavy housework, walking up a flight of stairs, and
walking one-half mile; and the Nagi Scale measures ability
to extend arms above shoulder level, manipulate small ob-
jects, stoop, crouch or kneel, and push a large object (20).
The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL)
assesses ability to do more integrative functions such as
using the telephone, traveling, shopping, and doing house-
work (21). In addition, self-reports of disease status, and
questions pertaining to life satisfaction and self-rated health
were recorded as previously described in detail (19).
At the time of the blood draw, 2,569 interviews were
conducted with the living members of the cohort (or their
proxies), all of whom were at least 70 years of age. Among
those interviewed, 67% had a successful blood draw
(1,727) and are the subjects of this report. Those not having
blood drawn were either unable to give consent, generally
because of cognitive dysfunction (269), or refused to have
blood drawn, were unavailable, or technically could not be
drawn (573). There were significant differences (p < .05)
among the three groups: blood drawn, unable to consent,
and refusers respectively as follows (means): age (71.6,
77.0, 72.5), % female (65.0, 72.1, 78.0), % Black (52.3,
61.7, 57.8), Katz ADL (0.3, 3.1, 0.5), Rosow-Breslau (1.0,
2.6, 1.3), Nagi (1.8, 1.3, 2.0), life satisfaction (10.6, n/a,
17.8), self-rated health (2.4, n/a, 2.9), and % cognitively
impaired (SPMSQ) (12.4, 78.8, 15.0). There were no differ-
ences in % urban (53.7, 52.4, 57.4), years of education (9.0,
7.0, 8.8), or % depressed (8.8, n/a, 10.2). Thus, those un-
able to give consent were significantly more functionally
and cognitively impaired, whereas those not having blood
drawn for other reasons were somewhat older, slightly
more cognitively impaired, and more functionally impaired
than the sample studied. This could have imposed some de-
gree of a ceiling on the relationships reported here.
Laboratory Methods for Measurement of IL-6
Blood was collected in EDTA-containing vacutainer
tubes, placed on ice and taken to the laboratory, where it
was centrifuged immediately to separate the plasma, which
was promptly frozen at -70 Â°C in 0.5 ml aliquots. Plasma
IL-6 was measured by ELISA; the minimal detectable level
was .35 pg/ml (Quantikine, R&D systems, Minneapolis,
MN) (22). The laboratory performing the IL-6 assays was
blinded to functional and health status of the subjects. We
have previously used this assay to conduct a pilot study of
the variability of plasma IL-6 over time in elderly subjects,
and it showed a high degree of reliability and reproducibil-
ity (23). For example, that analysis demonstrated that the
intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for one measure-
ment of IL-6 in 8 blood samples from an individual over a
period of 36 days was .87, indicating that a single sample
from a subject is quite representative of that individual's
IL-6 level over an extended period of time.
Statistical Analysis
The relationship of IL-6 with demographic variables,
health behaviors, functioning, hypertension, depression,
smoking, and self-report disease was assessed. In an initial
analysis, those with a valid blood draw were compared with
those unable to give consent and those who refused blood
drawn or were unavailable across the demographic and func-
tional variables as defined above. Differences between the
three groups were tested by analysis of variance (ANOVA).
All analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis
System (SAS).
In the next set of analyses, the relationship of IL-6 with the
independent variables of interest was assessed. In this data
set, IL-6 demonstrated a heavily right skewed distribution
(mean = 2.98 pg/ml, SD = 7.2, 88.9% less than 5 pg/ml). To
assess the significance, we therefore used methods not sensi-
tive to outliers and skew: Spearman's Rho for continuous
variables and Friedman's or Wilcoxon's test for discrete vari-
ables, and parametric techniques for the log of IL-6 (a linear
transformation which brought about near normality of the
IL-6 distribution). Discrete levels for each of the continuous
indicators were defined. For each level of each of these inde-
pendent variables, three statistics were calculated: percent
above 5 pg/ml (approximately highest 10% and the approxi-
mate breakpoint in the cumulative distribution curves -- See
Figure 1), median, and mean log (IL-6). For the median val-

ues presented, tests of significance were performed by the
Wilcoxon or Friedman's test. Goodness-of-fit chi-square was
used to assess the relationship of high IL-6 and group mem-
bership, and differences between log values between groups
were assessed by ANOVA.
Based on these results, we derived multivariable esti-
mates of the effect of health, function, and demographic
variables on IL-6. Two models were tested. First, to assess
which factors were related to extreme levels of IL-6 (IL-6
> 5 pg/ml), a forward stepwise logistic regression was per-
formed relating extreme IL-6 to the predictors of interest.
Second, since IL-6 showed such extreme skew, we analyzed
the normalized IL-6 (log transformed) and related the log of
IL-6 to the predictors of interest by a forward stepwise re-
gression. In all models, the demographic variables age, sex,
and race were forced into the final regression equation.
RESULTS
Figure 1 demonstrates the distribution of Plasma IL-6
levels in the entire population studied. As can be seen, IL-6
was detectable in most subjects. The mean and median val-
ues for the entire population were 2.98 pg/ml and 1.7
pg/ml, respectively. The values are not uniformly dis-
tributed, with 88.9% under 5 pg/ml and 96.2% under 10
pg/ml. Values above 10 pg/ml ranged as high as 201 pg/ml
in a few instances. Because the small number of subjects
with extremely high values (or outliers) can disproportion-
ately influence mean values, especially when relatively
small numbers of subjects fall in a particular comparison
group, median values are utilized for statistical compar-
isons between groups; and in order to normalize the distri-
bution, a log transformation of IL-6 was performed.
There is no significant difference in IL-6 values among
the various sex and racial groups. This is indicated in Table
1 where, regardless of whether assessing mean and median
values or percentage levels > 5 pg/ml, non-Blacks and

Blacks did not differ, nor did males differ from females. As
this table shows, age was strongly correlated with IL-6 lev-
els, both when assessing the median for the three age groups
and the percentage of values > 5 pg/ml. In additional analy-
ses, the Spearman correlation between age and IL-6 is .13
(p = < .0001). The age relationship holds for both males and
females in this elderly subject sample (p = < .0001). More-
over, age correlates with increasing IL-6 levels for both
racial groups of both sexes (p = < .0001) (Figure 2). The
final demographic variable assessed, urban/rural status, was
not associated with increasing IL-6 levels.
Table 2 shows the bivariate analysis of relationships be-
tween IL-6 and the measures of health status. The strongest
bivariate correlations were with the measures of functional
status. Regardless of whether functional status was assessed
by the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau Scale, or Nagi Scale, or
by measure of instrumental ADLs, poor functional status
was associated with progressively increasing IL-6 levels
(p = < .0001). Assessing general measures of health status,
IL-6 levels were correlated with self-rated health, rising
progressively from the best rated health states through the
poorest assessed health. There was also an association, but
a much weaker one, with life satisfaction.
Among the health conditions that were assessed in the
EPESE (Table 3), a history of cancer overall was not asso-
ciated with high IL-6 values, though the number with levels
> 5 pg/ml was higher. This relationship may be clouded by
the fact that this represents a history of cancer at any time
and thus the activity of the cancer is uncertain. No individ-
ual cancer type was associated with elevated levels of IL-6,
although in several, the number of cases is quite small (p >
0.4 in all cases). On the other hand, a history of current
cigarette smoking was associated with elevated IL-6 levels
as was a history of heart attack. A history of high blood
pressure was associated while stroke and diabetes were not.
Interestingly, a history of arthritis was not associated with
elevated IL-6 levels nor was a history of broken bone. A
history of a broken hip was weakly associated. In order to
address the issue of active vs inactive disease, the relation-
ship of IL-6 levels with the report of disease occurring

since the last survey was assessed (Table 4). Although the
case numbers are smaller, there is again no relationship for
cancer, stroke, and broken bones and only weak relation-
ships for hip fracture and heart attack.
Table 5 shows the multivariate analysis for both IL-6 > 5
pg/ml and for IL-6 levels. When controlling for all other
variables, age remains independently associated with in-
creased IL-6 values in both analyses. Current cigarette
smoking is consistently an independent predictor of ele-
vated IL-6 as is functional status by both Nagi and Katz as-
sessment. Cancer and high blood pressure show indepen-
dent relationships, but these associations are weaker than
those for age or functional status. In models for IL-6 values
> 5 pg/ml, female sex was negatively associated with IL-6
despite not having been associated in the bivariate analyses.
This occurred because age acted as a confounder. Thus
women tended to have lower IL-6 levels but also tended to
be older (associated with higher IL-6 levels). Only when
age was controlled is the sex effect noted. The other demo-
graphic variables, race and rural status, are shown but were

not retain independent associations (p > .05).
DISCUSSION
Utilizing a large number of subjects randomly selected
from a community-based population, our study demon-
strates that even in the over 70-year-old age group, age is
associated with IL-6 production independent of selected
disease states and disorders of aging. The consistency of
this elevation for both sexes and across racial lines, and the
consistency of the level of elevation with previous studies,
suggest that a primary aberration in IL-6 production may
play a prominent role in the increased values. This is con-
sistent with recent work in mice where the administration
of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or dietary restriction,
resulting in enhanced longevity, also reversed the increase
of IL-6 seen during aging (8,9).
Previous studies using small numbers of subjects have
shown increased levels of IL-6 in elderly, compared with
younger subjects, in whom IL-6 is generally not detectable
(12-15). This increase in IL-6 with age has been shown
both for plasma levels as well as mononuclear cell produc-
tion, and in humans as well as mice and primates (8,9,15).
This has led to suggestions that a dysregulation of IL-6 ex-
pression occurs with age, predisposing individuals to a
number of age-associated diseases with which IL-6 activa-
tion may play a role. These include cancer, in particular
B-cell neoplasms, and disorders of bone resorption (5,6).
These studies, however, have involved too few subjects in
the elderly age range to allow for robust analysis of such
possible relationships and, in particular, to assess the inde-
pendent relationship of age vs other disease states and dis-
orders of aging in order to provide the clues to the nature of
the IL-6 relationship. Our study, comprising a large number
of older subjects, provides support for the concept that even
in older age groups (> 70), IL-6 levels are associated with
increasing age, even apart from a number of age-associated
diseases and disorders.
We report for the first time a relationship of measures of
function (as well as self-rated health) with elevated IL-6
levels. That these measures of function are related to IL-6
independently, and to a much greater degree than any of the
individual diseases, suggests a primary dysregulation. This
is, of course, limited by the fact that specific disease infor-
mation is based on self-report only. Our findings suggest
also that IL-6 and potentially related cytokine networks
may play an important role in how older persons feel and
function. It has been pointed out previously that some of
the phenomena that IL-6 and related cytokines, such as
IL-1, produce may include fatigue, mediated through ef-
fects on the pituitary/adrenal axis (24,25). This has led to
the hypothesis that a variety of stressors (or in this case,
aging per se) could trigger IL-1 or IL-6 production which
could then produce fatigue -- or even chronic fatigue syn-
drome (26). It would be reasonable to speculate that in
older persons with increased IL-6 levels, feelings of fatigue
or decreased energy could result in lower self-ratings of
health and a lower sense of life satisfaction. This might per-
haps also decrease their ability to perform functionally. The
latter might be mediated by decreased motivation or by ac-
tual changes in hormonal and other biological factors that
could directly reduce energy levels. In a subsequent study,
we plan to assess the relationship of IL-6 and other inflam-
matory markers in this population with psychologic factors
and other biochemical markers.
We had hypothesized that increased IL-6 would be asso-
ciated with diseases common in old age as a marker of on-
going subclinical inflammation. Previous studies in several
cancers had indicated increased IL-6 production by mono-
cytes in head and neck cancer (27) and elevated serum IL-6
levels in Hodgkins disease and other malignancies (28). We
were surprised, therefore, to see the relative lack of overall
association with disorders such as cancer and arthritis
which might logically have fallen into that category. Can-
cer, however, was associated with some of the very ele-
vated values in the sample, suggesting that with active dis-
ease, the level may be increased and that the numbers of
specific cancers, e.g. lymphomas, myeloma, head and neck,
with which etiologic associations have been postulated,
may simply have been too small to detect independent as-
sociations. The lack of a relationship with self-report of
arthritis is also unexplained. Previous studies in arthritis
have shown an increase (29) or normal levels (30) of serum
IL-6. Our results are consistent with the latter report. How-
ever, our data are limited in that we did not have measures
of the specific type or severity of disease. Thus, it is likely
that most of the arthritis reported in our sample is os-
teoarthritis which, because of the age range of the subjects,
may represent largely "burned out" disease which is not
producing a major stimulus to the inflammatory response.
Moreover, our data on specific diseases are limited in that
they are obtained by self-report and may not as accurately
represent disease status as a clinical exam.
There were positive associations with smoking and
smoking-related disorders such as heart attack and hyper-
tension, and to a lesser extent, stroke. It is possible that
such relationships are mediated through the now generally

IL-6AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY M207
accepted relationship between the inflammatory processes
and the coagulation process, which may lead to a state of
increased peripheral coagulation (31,32). Such interactions
may also play a role in affecting functional status. In a pre-
vious study of a subcohort drawn from the EPESE for the
MacArthur study of successful aging, we demonstrated sig-
nificant relationships between indicators of subclinical al-
tered inflammatory and coagulation status (reduced A/G
ratio and elevated D-dimer levels), and functional decline
(measured by ADL and IADL), particularly in elderly
Black women (32). In future analyses of the full EPESE co-
hort, we will be able to explore the relationship of func-
tional decline and alterations of coagulation status as
marked by levels of circulating fibrin D-dimers.
On the basis of studies in mice, it has been suggested that
IL-6 is involved in bone resorption and thus might play a
role in osteoporosis etiology. Recent human studies have
confirmed elevated levels after menopause, but a lack of cor-
relation with bone density (33). In that study, the authors also
failed to find a relationship between age and IL-6 in the post-
menopausal women. It is likely that this was due to the small
sample size, as our study clearly shows a relationship of age
with IL-6 even in women long post-menopausal. In another
recent study, there was also a strong age relationship over the
20- through 90-year range with no specific influence of
menopausal status (34). However, there was no correlation
with markers of bone turnover and no correlation with osteo-
porosis (35). Consistent with these reports, we did not find an
independent relationship of IL-6 with hip fracture or other
fractures cross-sectionally. However, we did not have data on
bone mineral density or estimates of osteoporosis diagnoses.
Moreover, since plasma levels represent the sum of IL-6 pro-
duced from a wide range of sources, it is certainly possible
that IL-6 levels are much higher in the microenvironment of
bone in osteoporosis or arthritis, or neoplastic tissue in the
case of cancer, and play important roles in the pathogenesis
of such diseases without elevating the plasma IL-6.
This study has a number of limitations. It must be empha-
sized that this is a report of cross-sectional data. IL-6 levels
and age, functional status and other variables were simulta-
neously determined. Thus, we cannot be certain of any
cause-and-effect relationship between the associations
noted. Moreover, while the independent associations re-
ported are strongly statistically significant, the order of mag-
nitude of the absolute differences in IL-6 with age or func-
tional status is modest and must represent only a portion of
the variance. The elevated levels of IL-6 reported are gener-
ally not at the levels seen in active clinical disease. In fact,
as an epidemiologic study, the associations reported should
be taken as suggesting clues to possible biological and phys-
iologic relationships, with stronger evidence of causality to
come from future longitudinal studies.
In summary, IL-6 levels appear to be associated indepen-
dently with aging and functional status. This large-scale
study of older persons identifies these associations and
shows that the presence of proinflammatory cytokines can
be demonstrated in a large proportion of this population.
The pathophysiologic correlates of IL-6 activation and the
consequences of that activation are being explored in man
(2,6). Because functional status has been shown to correlate
strongly with subsequent survival, it is possible that IL-6
may be a good marker of such outcomes as well (36). Sub-
sequent follow-up of this population should allow us to as-
sess this prospectively.
Our studies suggest that cytokines such as IL-6 may be
playing an important role in mediating the aging process
and relationships between that process and functional out-
comes. Our demonstration of these associations suggests
the potential of using IL-6 as an intermediate outcome
marker in studies of interventions to alter age-related bio-
logic function. The use of anti-IL-6 antibodies, and other
approaches to inhibit the activity of this cytokine have been
suggested for therapeutic use (37,38). It would be of great
interest in future trials to determine if inhibition of this cy-
tokine can slow or reverse the functional decline associated
with aging and age-related diseases.
