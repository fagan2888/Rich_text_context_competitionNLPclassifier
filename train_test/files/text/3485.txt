Introduction
During the early schooling phase, the ability to master read-
ing is undoubtedly the premier academic achievement. It
prepares the children for all their educational endeavors and
is a key to the possibilities that the future has in store for
them (Bialystok, Luk, & Kwan, 2005). When beginning to
receive formal instruction in reading, a large majority of chil-
dren show no difficulty in learning how to read and write
under normal conditions. However, several millions of chil-
dren and adults worldwide, despite having average or above
average cognitive abilities, adequate educational conditions,
normal hearing and vision, have specific impairment in pick-
ing up reading (Schulte-Körne et al., 2007). Well-designed
literacy assessments help identifying the problem of students
in literacy development and guiding appropriate instruction
needed (Black & Wiliam, 2003; Helman, 2005; Hu &
Commeyras, 2008; National Council of Educational
Research and Training, 2006; Shaywitz & Shaywitz, 1994;
Torgesen, 2000).
India is one of the largest functionally multilingual coun-
tries in the world (Annamalai, 2001). The Report of the
Education Commission (1964-1966) of Central Government
of India recommended the Three-Language Formula (TLF),
which necessitates all primary schools to teach three lan-
guages to pupils (Kothari, 1966). The TLF includes mother-
tongue or the regional language; the official language of the
Union or the associate official language so long as it exists;
and a modern Indian or foreign language not covered above
and other than that used as a medium of instruction. After the
approval of the parliament, it was incorporated into the
National Policy on Education in 1968, and today almost all
schools in India expose their students to the learning of three
languages. In the state of Karnataka (where the present study
was conducted), majority of the schools teach Kannada,
English, and Hindi. Kannada, a Dravidian language, is the
official language of Karnataka State and is spoken by about
50 to 60 million people in India. It is an agglutinative, highly
inflective language, which follows subject­object­verb
order canonically. Kannada orthography is an alphasylla-
bary, in which orthographic units (called akshara) represent
syllables. It is a transparent orthography. As the grain size is
larger, it has a larger set of symbols. Furthermore, it has
hardly a few monosyllabic words, the most common words
having two or three syllables (more details of Kannada may
be seen in Prakash & Joshi, 1989, 1995). Hindi, a major

Assessment

Abstract
The challenge of mastering reading is universally seen across all populations and languages. A small fraction of students
all over the world, however, fail in learning to read proficiently. Early assessments can help children who are likely to get
into the vicious circle of failure in mastering word reading, leading to poor academic performance and eventually to low
motivation in academics and possible lifelong socioeconomic and mental health consequences. In languages such as English,
there are quite a few tests available for early assessment and interventions. In India, a multilingual society, all children going
to school learn to read at least in three languages, including English. Dearth of suitable assessment tools in local languages is
a major impediment in clinical services and research. Here, we report an attempt at developing a quick and reliable test for
assessment of decoding and sight-word reading skills in Kannada language.

language used all over India, belongs to the Indo-European
family of languages. Both Kannada and Hindi orthographies
are derived from a common source, Brahmi (Coulmas,
1989). English and the Indian writing systems have contrast-
ing features with respect to transparency, grain size, and the
orthographic principle (Padakannaya & Mohanty, 2004;
Padakannaya & Ramachandra, 2011). Furthermore, different
writing systems put different cognitive demands on readers,
which are reflected in the way reading and spelling/spelling
are acquired in those languages (Chengappa, Bhat, &
Padakannaya, 2004; Padakannaya, Rekha, Vaid, & Joshi,
2002; Perfetti, 1999; Wang, Liu, & Perfetti, 2004; Ziegler &
Goswami, 2006). In such multilingual settings where chil-
dren are formally exposed to two or three languages simulta-
neously, testing needs to be done in all the languages children
are learning for any assessment or diagnostic purposes.
There are several standard tests available for assessing
reading ability in languages such as English that facilitate
research studies and early assessment of reading skills in nor-
mal and at-risk children. However, in a multiliterate setting
like India, there is dearth for such tools in local languages.
There is an urgent need to develop tests in the Indian lan-
guages, which will help identify children in need for interven-
tion. This will save them from the vicious circle of the mental
trauma they would experience on account of academic diffi-
culties. Here, we report an attempt at developing a quick and
reliable measure for assessment of decoding and sight-word
reading skills of higher primary and high schoolchildren in
Kannada language, one of the major languages of India, in the
lines of Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE) in
English (Torgesen, Wagner, & Rashotte, 1999). The TOWRE,
a widely used test in English, assesses sight-word efficiency
and phonemic decoding efficiency by asking readers to read a
list of high frequency words and another list of pseudo-words
for 45 s each. The Performance on the first list provides a
measureofone'ssight-wordreading,whereasthePerformance
on the second list provides an index of one's decoding ability.
The present article presents a brief account of our attempt at
developing a similar measure in Kannada with an assumption
that development of such measures helps cross-linguistic
comparisons in multilingual contexts prevailing in India.
Method
Participants
Fifty (30 boys and 20 girls) students, studying in an English-
medium school and taught Kannada and English from the
first-grade level, participated in the study. Their age ranged
from 10 to 18 years. Twenty-six of them were studying at the
middle school level (Grades 5-8), and 24 were from the sec-
ondary to the higher secondary level (Grades 8-12) as per the
Indian school system.
Their inclusion in the study was based on the class teach-
ers' checklist report endorsing that children were average or
higher than average performers with consistency in academics
and did not have any observable physical or psychological/
behavioral/emotional problems on record. All of them
belonged to middle or high socioeconomic families.
Procedure
The first phase involved preparing a list of words for sight-
word efficiency (drishti pada in Kannada) and pseudo-words
(husi pada in Kannada) for phonological decoding efficiency
sections of the proposed Kannada test. The first author went
through Kannada language textbooks of Grade Levels 1
through 5, made a list of words and frequency of their appear-
ing in the textbooks. These words were arranged according to
their frequency, that is, words of high frequency were placed
at the beginning of the list, followed by words that were less
frequent (the frequency ranged from 1 to 117). Following
this, we performed a median split and considered the words
above the median for the proposed list for sight-word reading.
Of this list, we prepared two separate lists A and B of 72
words matching for frequency and mixing words of varied
lengths and syllables in complexity. The mean frequency of
words in Lists A and B was comparable (13.6 and 17.9), and
the difference was not statistically significant. Both the lists
were serially rearranged in the order of increasing frequency
of words. Furthermore, two experienced primary school
Kannada language teachers ranked the words based on their
perception of how familiar the words were to schoolchildren.
There was a very significant correlation between the raters
(.95 and .93, respectively, on Lists A and B).
Two lists of 62 pseudo-words each were prepared for
assessing phonological decoding skill. Pseudo-words (husi
pada) were prepared by substituting a phoneme or a syllable
of a real word by another without violating the orthographic
rules of Kannada language. The composition and arrangement
of pseudo-words within the lists were similar to those of sight-
word (drishti pada) lists, that is, they were arranged in an
increasing order of length and syllable/akshara complexity.
Thus, at the end of the first phase, we had two lists (A and B),
each for assessing sight-word reading skill and pseudo-word
reading skill. The whole process of preparing the final list of
words along with two helpers took about a month's time.
Reliability Measures
Anew group of 10 students (6 girls and 4 boys) from a higher
primary school participated in this part of the study aimed at
checking the odd­even reliability and reliability coefficient
for the whole test. Every participant was asked to read the
lists of words arranged column wise on a sheet of paper, as
quickly and accurately as possible on saying "start" until told
to stop. They were instructed that they should skip words
found difficult and proceed with the subsequent ones. The
number of words correctly read in 45 s, and the total number
of words read as well as the time taken to read the whole list
was noted down. The order of administration of lists was ran-
domized to control the order effect. The odd­even reliability
Saldanha et al. 3
and reliability coefficient for the whole test for sight-word
and pseudo-word lists are presented in Table 1. All the mea-
sures exhibited a very high degree of reliability and internal
consistency.
The stability-over-time or test­retest reliability was deter-
mined by administering these tests to a group of 50 children
(30 boys and 20 girls from Grade Levels 4 through 12) twice
with a gap of 2 weeks between testing sessions. The obtained
mean, standard deviations, and correlation coefficient values
of the pre- and post-test scores are shown in Table 2. The
magnitude of the correlation coefficient values was .91 and
above, which definitely meet the required criterion of .90 for
such purposes (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). The alternate
forms, used to assess sight-word and pseudo-word reading,
were also found to be highly correlated (see Table 3).
Validity
The lists of sight words and pseudo-words were evaluated
for validity. If these tests tap underlying reading skills, the
reading scores should increase over the grade levels and the
mean differences between lower and higher grades should be
statistically significant.
A gradual increase in performance over the grade levels
on all word lists was observed (see Figures 1-3). The results
of the independent-samples t tests confirmed that the mean
differences between lower grades (5 and 6) and higher grades
(11 and 12) on the total score of formsAand B of sight words
(drishti pada) and pseudo-words (husi pada) were signifi-
cant, t(10) = 3.28, p < .01, and t(10) = 3.19, p < .01,
respectively.
Conclusion
To make important decisions with respect to specific scores,
a reliability of .90 is the bare minimum, and a reliability of
.95 is considered the desirable standard (Nunnally &
Bernstein, 1994). Most values in the present study reached or
exceeded the minimum standard of .90. Thus, the reading
lists constructed (given in the appendix) for assessing sight-
word reading and pseudo-word reading are reliable tools that
could be the resources available in Kannada for assessment

and research purposes. The new measures also exhibited sat-
isfactory criterion validity as the tests successfully differenti-
ated between lower grade­level and higher grade­level
students. We do believe that ours is an earnest, albeit small,
attempt to address the need for developing valid and reliable
measures in languages and orthographies that are less
studied. It is not only beneficial for the population studied
but also could be useful in bilingual/trilingual education
studies and cross-linguistic comparisons. However, we
acknowledge the limitation of the study in having a small
sample with a broad age range. Future studies may further
validate the measures we have presented here.
