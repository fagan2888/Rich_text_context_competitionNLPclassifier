Objectives. The prevalence of depressive symptoms and associated risk factors is described, using data from the
Hispanic EPESE, the first large, representative study of older Mexican Americans.
Methods. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the association between depressive symptoms and
sociodemographics, chronic health conditions, disability, and cultural factors.
Results. Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, 25.6% of the 2,823 subjects reported high
symptom levels. Rates among women (31.9%) and particularly men (17.3%) were higher than has been typically
reported for older Mexican Americans and older adults in general. Consistent with previous studies of older adults,
gender, lack of insurance, financial strain, chronic health conditions, and disability were found to be associated with
depressive symptoms. Several cultural factors were also associated with increased risk, including immigrant status,
levels of acculturation and assimilation, health locus of control, and recency of immigration. An interaction between
gender and immigrant status was found such that, in relation to subjects born in the United States, female immigrants
were at significantly higher risk for depressive symptoms, whereas male immigrants were at lower risk.
Discussion. Our findings suggest that the increased prevalence can be attributed to higher rates of sociodemo-
graphic risk factors and functional disability, coupled with cultural factors and chronic medical conditions.
DEPRESSION, considered one of the leading mental
health problems among adults, is being viewed in-
creasingly as a biopsychosocial phenomenon (Leventhal &
Tomarken, 1987). From this perspective, risk factors in-
clude social factors (such as gender, education, impoverish-
ment, marital status, and social isolation), psychological
factors (such as life stresses and bereavement), and biologi-
cal factors (such as physical illness and disability), factors
which have been consistently found to be associated with
psychological distress, regardless of ethnicity or age (Kae-
bler, Moul, & Farmer, 1995). The biopsychosocial approach
is particularly appropriate, however, for the study of depres-
sion among older adults. Surveys such as the Yale, Duke,
and Iowa Established Populations for the Epidemiologic
Study of the Elderly (EPESE) have provided ample evi-
dence of the influence of these risk factors on mental well-
being (Berkman et al., 1986; Black, Goodwin, & Markides,
1998; Blazer, Hughes, & George, 1987; O'Hara, Kohout, &
Wallace, 1985). Indeed, it has been postulated that much of
the increase in self-reported depressive symptoms among
older adults (Newman, 1989) can be attributed to the influ-
ence of these risk factors. As Blazer and colleagues pointed
out, the major risk factors for depression do not seem to
differ by age, but the distribution of these factors often dif-
fers substantially across the adult age range: older adults
are more likely to be women, to be impoverished, to live
alone with fewer social contacts, and to be physically ill
and disabled (Blazer, Burchett, Service, & George, 1991).
Despite the general consensus regarding risk factors for
depression among older adults, the rates of depression
among various ethnic groups of older adults appear to dif-
fer considerably. Review of available mental health data
indicates that among older community-dwelling non-His-
panic Whites and African Americans, reported rates of de-
pressive symptoms are generally in the range from 9% to
17% (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer, Hughes, & George,
1987; Callahan & Wolinsky, 1994; Eaton & Kessler, 1981;
Murrell, Himmelfarb, & Wright, 1983; O'Hara, Kohout, &
Wallace, 1985). Inconsistencies exist, however, in epidemi-
ologic findings regarding psychological distress among
older Mexican Americans. Several investigators have re-
ported that the burden of psychological distress may be
greater among this subgroup of the population than among
older adults in general (Frerichs, Aneshensel, & Clark,
1981; Vernon, Roberts, & Lee, 1982). Using the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale, the Three Gen-
erations Study of Mexican Americans reported the preva-
lence rate of high levels of depressive symptoms to be 20%
among older adults (Mendes de Leon & Markides, 1988).
Vega, Warheit, Buhl-Auth, and Meinhardt (1984) reported
rates in the range of 16% to 18%. Similar rates have been
reported by investigators employing other scales to mea-
S198
DEPRESSION IN OLDER MEXICAN AMERICANS S199
sure psychological distress (Kemp, Staples, & Lopez-Aque-
res, 1987; Lopez-Aqueres, Kemp, Plopper, Staples, &
Brummel-Smith, 1984; Quesada, Spears, & Ramos, 1978).
In contrast, other investigators have reported no elevated
risk for psychological distress among older Mexican Amer-
icans. Rates of 12% to 13%, based on data from the His-
panic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES;
Garcia & Marks, 1989; Moscicki, Locke, Rae, & Boyd,
1989), for example, are more comparable to those reported
for older non-Hispanic Whites and African Americans.
These inconsistencies might be the result of limitations
in study methodologies, including sample sizes under 200
(Moscicki et al., 1989; Quesada et al., 1978), samples that
have included very few individuals over age 65 (Frerichs et
al., 1981; Vernon, Roberts, & Lee, 1982), and samples that
have been limited in geographic area, such as only Califor-
nia ( Kemp et al., 1987; Lopez-Aqueres et al., 1984; Vega
et al., 1984) or Texas (Mendes de Leon & Markides, 1988),
and which were not fully representative of the entire popu-
lation of older Mexican Americans.
Another possible reason for these discrepancies concerns
additional risk factors that may influence the psychological
well-being of older Mexican Americans. Factors that could
reduce the rate of depressive symptoms include not only
lower rates of many chronic health conditions (e.g., stroke
and hip fracture), but also the greater sense of familism,
increased social support, higher rates of marriage, and
greater reliance on religion evident in the Mexican Ameri-
can culture, in comparison to mainstream American culture
(Paniagua, 1994). Conversely, cultural factors such as lan-
guage, fatalism, and the stress associated with immigration
and acculturation, in addition to the lack of health insurance
coverage experienced by many older Mexican Americans,
may act to increase the risk for depressive symptoms.
This article examines the extent of depressive symptoma-
tology in older Mexican Americans, as well as demographic,
social, cultural, and health-related correlates, using data
from the Hispanic Established Populations for Epidemio-
logic Studies of the Elderly (Hispanic EPESE). This survey
is the first large-scale population-based study that employs a
representative sample of older Mexican Americans from five
of the southwestern United States. It was designed to assess
the physical health, mental health, and functional status of
older community-dwelling Mexican Americans. In this
study, we address three specific hypotheses:
1. The prevalence of depressive symptomatology reported
by older Mexican Americans is substantially higher than
that reported by older non-Hispanic Whites and African
Americans;
2. Additional risk factors specific to the Mexican American
culture are associated with greater risk for depressive
symptoms among older Mexican Americans; and
3. The combination of cultural risk factors and higher
rates of standard risk factors accounts for the increase in
reported depressive symptoms among older Mexican
Americans.
In the Southwest, approximately 525,000 Mexican Amer-
icans are age 65 years or older, representing over 5% of the
entire Mexican American population and the third largest
group of minority elders in the United States (Bureau of the
Census, 1990). Adding to our understanding of psychologi-
cal distress in this group of older adults is important, partic-
ularly in regards to the excess risk among women and im-
migrants. In addition, more research regarding the extent of
depression and the influences of cultural differences can
lead not only to improvements in well-being and quality of
life for older Mexican Americans, but for all older adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
The Hispanic EPESE is the latest in a series of panel sur-
veys conducted in various portions of the United States
(East Boston, New Haven, Iowa, and North Carolina) that
were designed to examine the health status of older com-
munity-dwelling adults. The initial wave of the Hispanic
EPESE was conducted during 1993 and 1994 in Texas, Col-
orado, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Area proba-
bility sampling was employed to sample a total of 3,050
Mexican Americans aged 65 and older, a response rate of
approximately 86%. In order to construct the sampling
frame, all counties in the five-state area were ranked ac-
cording to 1990 Census figures by number of Mexican
Americans aged 65 and older. Those counties that con-
tained 90% of all older Mexican Americans were retained.
Within these listed counties, individual census tracts were
then similarly ranked and those tracts that included 90% of
the older Mexican Americans were listed. Three hundred
primary sampling units (PSUs) were then selected with
probabilities proportional to the number of older Mexican
Americans. Within each of these selected PSUs, all block
groups were listed and a cumulative total of households cal-
culated. Blocks in each track were then selected as sam-
pling units by a random process, and a total of 175 house-
holds within each sampling unit were screened. Eligible
respondents were identified based on reported age, self-
identification as a Mexican American, reported birthplace
(Mexico or the U.S.), and a review of the ethnic back-
ground of an individual's parents and grandparents. Further
description of the survey methods can be found in Markides
etal. (1996).
All interviews were conducted in person and took an av-
erage of 1 hour 45 minutes to complete. Although inter-
views were conducted for a total of 3,050 individuals, the
analyses presented here reflect the reports of 2,823 individ-
uals for whom complete depressive symptom data were
available (complete symptom data were not available for
227 subjects for whom proxy interviews were conducted as
a result of their being too ill or cognitively impaired and 13
individuals who responded to less than 17 of the depressive
items). When weighted for the actual number of older Mex-
ican Americans in the five-state area, the sample represents
just under 500,000 Mexican Americans aged 65 and older.
Measures
The study involved in-home interviews conducted either
in Spanish or English, depending on the respondent's pref-
erence. Questionnaire items included self-reports of so-
S200 BLACK ETAL.
ciodemographic, cultural, and health-related measures. So-
ciodemographic measures included characteristics such as
the respondent's age (as of the most recent birthday), gen-
der, years of education, whether he or she was currently
employed, current marital status, living arrangement (num-
ber of persons residing in the household), and whether he
or she had a confidant (someone with whom to discuss his
or her deepest problems). Subjects were categorized as be-
reaved if they reported that a close friend or relative had
died in the year prior to interview. Respondents were also
asked about health insurance coverage, including private
insurance, Medicare coverage (Parts A and B), Medicaid
coverage, Veterans' benefits, or if they had no coverage what-
soever. Financial strain was measured by asking respon-
dents if they experienced a great deal, some, little, or no
difficulties in paying their monthly bills.
Cultural measures included immigrant status (based on
reported place of birth) and recency of immigration (five or
fewer years vs more than five years), as well as levels of
acculturation and assimilation, which were measured using
a modified version of the Acculturation Scale developed by
Hazuda, Haffner, and Stern (1988). The measure of accul-
turation consisted of 10 items assessing patterns of English
and Spanish language use. Possible scores range from 3 to
50, with lower scores indicative of lower acculturation. The
measure of assimilation consisted of 3 items assessing
functional integration into mainstream society. Possible
scores range from 3 to 9, with lower scores indicative of
lower assimilation. Health locus of control was assessed
with an item that asked respondents how much control they
felt they had over the general state of their health, through
their own actions. This measure was employed as an indica-
tor of fatalism as it pertains to health.
Health-related measures included a series of items in
which the respondents were asked whether they had ever
been told by a doctor that they had certain chronic condi-
tions, including cardiac problems, stroke, cancer, diabetes,
gall bladder disease, hip fracture, arthritis, or incontinence.
In addition, self-reported impairments in bathing, dressing,
grooming, eating, transferring from bed to chair, using a
toilet, and walking were measured with the Katz Activities
of Daily Living scale (ADL; Katz, Ford, Moskowitz, Jack-
son, & Jaffe, 1963). These items were scored dichoto-
mously, according to whether the respondent reported need-
ing help to perform the activity. Scores were calculated
representing the number of chronic conditions and the num-
ber of ADL impairments reported by each respondent.
Psychological distress was measured with the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which
was specifically designed to help identify depressive symp-
toms in community surveys (Radloff, 1977). The scale con-
sists of 20 items that ask how often specific symptoms were
experienced during the past week. Responses are scored on
a 4-point scale, with potential total scores ranging from
0-60. A cut point of 16 or greater is typically used to distin-
guish symptomatology in the clinical range (Boyd, Weiss-
man, Thompson, & Myers, 1982; Newman, 1989). Al-
though the scale does not provide a diagnosis of actual
clinical depression, it has been shown to predict both cur-
rent and future clinical depression (Roberts & Vernon,
1983; Schulberg, McClelland, & Burns, 1987). The CES-D
has been the most widely used survey measure of psycho-
logical distress in studies of older adults and has been
found highly reliable and valid (Blazer, Hughes, & George,
1987; Himmelfarb & Murrell, 1983).
Missing values were computed for 13 individuals who
had three or fewer missing CES-D values by substituting
the average score of the remaining negative responses for a
missing negative item score, or the average score of the re-
maining positive responses for a missing positive item
score (Berkman et al., 1986). This method of substitution
made no change in the alpha coefficient of the scale (0.90).
Two measures were derived from the CES-D in this study,
a continuous measure based on the overall score and a
dichotomous measure of caseness (indicative of high level
of depressive symptomatology) based on the cutpoint of 16
or more.
Analyses
Differences in the mean CES-D scores across indepen-
dent variables were evaluated with Mest and analysis of
variance statistics. Chi-square analysis was employed to
evaluate differences in the prevalence rates of high levels of
depressive symptomatology.
Once the bivariate relationships between the depressive
symptom measures and social, cultural, and health-related
characteristics were examined, independent variables were
entered into multiple regression models. Logistic regression
employing stepwise selection was used to model the di-
chotomous measure of high levels of depressive symptoms
(Glantz & Slinker, 1990; Kleinbaum, Kupper, & Muller,
1988). Models included testing of interaction terms based
on the presence of significant main effects.
All analyses incorporated weighted data that were ad-
justed for design effects in order to produce results that
were representative of the older Mexican American popula-
tion in the five-state region. Confidence intervals were com-
puted using SUDAAN (Shah, Barnwell, Hunt, & LaVange,
1993).
RESULTS
Bivariate Results
Table 1 presents the distribution of sociodemographic,
cultural, and health-related characteristics for the total sam-
ple and, separately, by gender. About 57% of the respon-
dents were women, a lower percentage than is often re-
ported with other older ethnic populations but which
reflects the older Mexican American population. Two thirds
were aged 65-74, with an average age of 72.6 years.
Women were more likely to be aged 75 and older than were
men. The level of education was low, with an average of
just over five years of schooling; less than 11% graduated
from high school. The vast majority (96.1%) was not cur-
rently employed. Over 89% of the sample reported having
some type of medical insurance benefits. The older women
were less likely to have insurance coverage than the older
men, although the difference was significant only at the
trend level. Financial strain was common, with over half of

both the men and women experiencing some to a great deal
of difficulty paying monthly bills.
Just over half of the respondents were currently married;
older men were much more likely to be married and much
less likely to be widowed than older women. About 22%
lived alone, over 56% lived in two- or three-person house-
holds, and about 22% lived in households of four or more
people. The older women were more likely to live alone
than the older men. More than 80% of both men and
women reported having a confidant, and 18% reported hav-
ing had a close friend or relative die in the year prior to the
interview.
Slightly more than half of the respondents had been born
in the United States, 2.8% had immigrated in the past five
years, and 41.9% had immigrated more than five years ago,
with no significant differences between men and women.
More than half (55.3%) of the respondents reported low
levels of acculturation, and almost two thirds (63.5%) re-
ported low assimilation, with older women less likely than
older men to report moderate to high acculturation or as-
similation. Regarding health locus of control, older women
were more likely to feel they had little control over their
health, whereas older men were more likely to feel they had
a great deal of control.
About 22% of the sample reported having no chronic
conditions, 27% reported having one condition, and 51%
reported having two or more conditions. The older women
were much more likely than the older men to report having
two or more conditions and much less likely to report hav-
ing no conditions. About 12% of the sample reported need-
ing help with at least one ADL, with little gender variation.
The distributions of weighted CES-D scores and preva-
lence rates for high levels of depressive symptomatology
are presented in Table 2. The distribution of CES-D scores
was significantly skewed (Kolmogorov D = 0.15, p < .01),
with a greater proportion of respondents scoring in the
lower range. The mean CES-D score for the entire sample
was 10.5 and the overall prevalence of high levels of
depressive symptoms was 25.6%. As noted in the table,
however, these measures varied considerably by socio-
demographic, cultural, and health-related characteristics.
For example, older women had significantly higher mean
CES-D scores than older men (12.2 vs 8.3) and almost
twice the prevalence rate (31.9% vs 17.3%). The mean
CES-D scores and prevalence rates increased only slightly
with age and were significantly higher among the less edu-
cated. No differences in either CES-D scores or prevalence
rates were evident for employment status. However, re-
spondents who reported no form of health insurance cover-
age were at significantly higher risk for high levels of de-
pressive symptoms, as were respondents who reported
financial strain.
Both scores and prevalence rates were significantly higher
among those who had been married formerly (i.e., di-
vorced, separated, or widowed) in comparison to those who
were currently married or who had never married. Those
who lived alone were at a slightly higher risk for high lev-
els of depressive symptoms. Significantly lower scores and
prevalence rates were reported by respondents who had a
confidant, and significantly higher scores and rates were re-

ported by those who had experienced the death of a loved
one in the year prior to interview.
In terms of cultural factors, significant differences were
evident for immigrant status, with immigrants at higher risk
than those born in the United States. Recent immigrants
were at particularly high risk, with an average CES-D score
of 16.9 and a prevalence rate of 57.2%. Respondents with
low levels of acculturation had substantially higher CES-D
scores and prevalence rates in relation to those with moder-
ate to high acculturation. Substantial differences in mean
CES-D scores were not apparent for level of assimilation,
but those with low levels of assimilation had substantially
higher prevalence rates than those who were moderately or
highly assimilated. Substantial differences for both scores
and prevalence rates were evident for health locus of con-
trol, with those feeling less control at significantly higher
risk than those feeling more control.
Both the mean CES-D scores and the prevalence rates in-
creased with the number of reported chronic conditions,
with those reporting two or more conditions at significantly
higher risk. Similarly, those respondents who reported any
ADL impairments had significantly higher mean CES-D
scores and higher prevalence rates than those who reported
no such impairments.
Multivariate Results
An initial logistic regression indicated that female gen-
der, no insurance coverage, financial strain, and recent im-
migration increased the risk for depressive symptoms, as
did the number of reported chronic conditions and having
any ADL impairment. A lower risk was associated with
higher education, higher acculturation and assimilation, and
feeling greater control over health. With the above predic-
tors in the equation, age, employment, marital status, living
arrangement, immigrant status, and language of interview
were no longer significant.
Importantly, an interaction between gender and immi-
grant status was also found. In order to better understand
this phenomenon, we conducted analyses stratified by
gender. The results of these regressions are presented in
Table 3. As can be seen in the table, different models were
derived for men and women. In both genders, financial
strain, the number of chronic conditions, and ADL impair-
ment increased the risk for high levels of depressive symp-
toms. The direction of the effects of education, no in-
surance coverage, low assimilation, and health locus of
control were the same for both genders, but were much
stronger predictors among the older women, whereas not
having a confidant and experiencing the death of a close
friend or relative were much stronger predictors among
the older men.
Interestingly, nonrecent immigration (more than five
years prior to interview) was a stronger predictor in women
than in men, and the effects were in opposite directions. As
can be seen in Table 3, nonrecent immigrant women were
at significantly higher risk for high levels of depressive
symptoms than women born in the United States (although
not as high as among recent immigrant women), whereas
nonrecent immigrant men were at somewhat less risk than
those born in the United States. Individuals who had imrni-

grated in the past five years were at substantially higher
risk, regardless of gender.
Differences were most dramatic among older women: the
mean CES-D score was 11.4 among the women born in the
U.S., 12.9 among the nonrecent immigrant women, and
17.7 among the recent immigrant women. Prevalence rates
for high levels of depressive symptoms were 28.2 among
the women born in the U.S., 34.9 among the nonrecent im-
migrant women, and 56.6 among the recent immigrant
women. Less dramatic differences were evident among
older men, with mean CES-D scores of 8.4 and 7.7 and
prevalence rates of 17.4 and 14.6 among the men born in
the U.S. and the nonrecent immigrant men. Among the re-
cent immigrant men, the mean CES-D score of 15.6 and
prevalence rate of 58.3 were comparable to those of recent
immigrant women.
As a result, we were particularly interested in any appar-
ent differences between immigrant and nonimmigrant
women, regarding factors associated with depressive symp-
toms. Table 4 presents results of analyses stratified by im-
migrant status for the older women. Financial strain and
chronic health conditions increased the risk for high symp-
tom levels in both the immigrant and U.S.-born women.
The direction of the effects of education, lack of insurance
coverage, low assimilation, and ADL impairments were the
same for both groups of women, but lack of insurance cov-
erage and ADL impairment were much stronger predictors
among the older immigrant women, whereas education,
low assimilation, and health locus of control were stronger
predictors among the U.S.-born women. As noted earlier,
recent immigrant women were at higher risk for high levels
of depressive symptoms. Living arrangements were found
to have opposite effects in the two groups: living alone was
associated with greater risk among the immigrant women
and lower risk among women born in the United States.
DISCUSSION
Prevalence of Depressive Symptomatology
The prevalence of depressive symptoms was consider-
ably higher in this study than generally has been reported
for older adults in other studies. Table 5 presents the preva-
lence rates reported in other studies that employed the
CES-D among community-dwelling older adults. The rate
of 25.6% found in this study was higher than that found in
the Three Generations Study of Mexican Americans (20.0%;
Mendes de Leon & Markides, 1988) and substantially
higher than the rate reported for older Mexican Americans
in the HHANES (13.2%; Moscicki et al., 1989). A compa-
rable rate was reported for Mexican Americans in the
Alameda County study (30.0%; Vernon, Roberts, & Lee,
1982), however, as noted in the table, these respondents
ranged in age from 46 to 60 years, a considerably younger
group than the subjects in the Hispanic EPESE. Indeed, our
findings are more in line with several studies that have re-
ported higher rates of depressive symptoms among younger,
nonelderly Mexican Americans (Frerichs et al., 1981; Ver-
non & Roberts, 1982; Vega et al., 1984).
The rate of depression found in the present study is also
considerably higher than rates reported in studies of older
non-Hispanics. As can be seen in Table 5, lower rates have
been reported for older African Americans and non-Hispanic
Whites in the Duke EPESE (9.0%; Blazer et al., 1991), the
Yale EPESE (16.4%; Berkman et al., 1986), and the Iowa
EPESE (9.0%; O'Hara, Kohout, & Wallace, 1985), as well as
the NHANES I (14.8%; Eaton & Kessler, 1981), and other
studies that have employed the CES-D (16.3%; Callahan &
Wolinsky, 1994; 16.9%; Kennedy et al., 1989). A more com-
parable rate of 22.0% was reported by Jones-Webb and
Snowden (1993) for African Americans aged 60-69.

study and what has been reported previously are apparent
even when the men and women are considered separately.
Among older women, for example, the rate of 31.9% found
in this study is higher than the rate of 26.0% found in the
Three Generations Study (Mendes de Leon & Markides,
1988), the 10.7% reported in the Duke EPESE (Blazer et
al., 1991), or the 19.2% reported in the Yale EPESE (Berk-
man et al., 1986). The rates found in the present study are
particularly high, however, in regards to older Mexican
American men: our rate of 17.3% is considerably higher
than the 5.0% reported for older Mexican American men in
the Three Generations Study (Mendes de Leon & Markides,
DEPRESSION IN OLDER MEXICAN AMERICANS S205
1988) and the 6.4% reported for males in the Duke EPESE
(Blazer et al., 1991). These differences are also evident in
the mean CES-D scores.
Standard Risk Factors
Many of the risk factors for depressive symptoms found in
the present study are consistent with those identified in previ-
ous studies of older adults, including older Mexican Ameri-
cans. These include gender (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et
al., 1991; Moscicki et al., 1989), lack of insurance coverage
(Callahan, Hui, Nienaber, Musick, & Tierney, 1994), finan-
cial difficulties (Eaton & Kessler, 1981; Vega, Kolody, &
Warheit, 1985), living arrangements, not having a confidant,
and bereavement (Vega, Kolody, Valle, & Hough, 1986). As
has been reported for other groups of older adults (Blazer et
al., 1991), we found no association between age and depres-
sive symptoms, particularly when controlling for confound-
ing measures such as disability, financial stress, and isolation.
Our findings regarding marital status were mixed. Simi-
lar to several other studies (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et
al., 1991; Moscicki et al.,1989; Vega et al., 1986), bivariate
analyses indicated that disrupted marital status was associ-
ated with greater risk for depressive symptoms in this sam-
ple of older Mexican Americans. In our multivariate analy-
ses, however, the influence of marital status disappeared.
This may in part be the result of the comparatively low
rates of divorce and separation among Mexican Americans.
However, it also suggests that, at least among older Mexi-
can Americans, widowhood may not have as strong an ef-
fect on psychological well-being as has been postulated.
Education has been found to have an inverse relationship
with depressive symptoms among older adults, with those
less educated at higher risk (Moscicki et al., 1989; Vega et
al., 1984). The risk for depressive symptoms among older
Blacks and Whites was found to be higher among women
and among the less educated in the previous EPESE sur-
veys (Berkman et al., 1986; Blazer et al., 1991; O'Hara et
al., 1985), as well as in other studies of older adults (Calla-
han & Wolinsky, 1994; Jones-Webb & Snowden, 1993;
Kennedy et al., 1989; Lopez-Aqueres et al., 1984). In the
present study, a higher level of education was associated
with a significantly lower risk for depressive symptoms in
bivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, this influence
remained significant among the older women with 12 or
more years of education, but disappeared among the older
men. This may be the result of generally very low levels of
education in this group of older Mexican Americans.
Current employment has also generally been found to
have a protective effect (Mendes de Leon & Markides,
1988; Moscicki et al., 1989), but none was found in the pre-
sent study. This may be the result of so few of the older
Mexican Americans being currently employed.
The influence of chronic conditions and functional im-
pairment on psychological distress found in this sample of
older Mexican Americans is also consistent with that found
among the older population in general (Berkman et al.,
1986; Blazer et al., 1991; Murrell et al., 1983), as well as
other studies of older Mexican Americans (Lewinsohn,
Hoberman, & Rosenbaum, 1988; Palinkas, Wingard, &
Barrett-Connor, 1990; Vega et al., 1986).
Cultural Risk Factors
Our findings both support and contrast other reports re-
garding the influence of cultural factors on depressive
symptomatology. Our finding that low acculturation is asso-
ciated with higher risk for depressive symptoms is consis-
tent with other literature (Griffin, 1983; Masten, Penland, &
Nayani, 1994). Moyerman and Forman (1992) postulated
that the stress of acculturation is a primary factor in adjust-
ment problems among immigrants. Several investigators
have found increased risk among respondents who con-
ducted interviews in Spanish (Garcia & Marks, 1989; Vega
et al., 1985). In the Hispanic HANES, however, Moscicki
et al. (1989) found no significant difference among Mexi-
can Americans according to language of interview, al-
though they did find higher rates of depression among those
Cubans and Puerto Ricans who responded in Spanish.
Of particular note is our finding that immigrant women
and recent immigrants of both genders are at greater risk
for depressive symptomatology than their U.S.-born coun-
terparts. With the exception of recent immigrants, older
immigrant men were at lower risk than their U.S.-born
counterparts. In contrast, Moscicki et al. (1989) found non-
immigrants of both genders to report higher levels of psy-
chological distress. Similarly, Golding and Burnam (1990)
found Mexican immigrants had lower depression scores
than Mexican Americans born in the United States.
These results indicate that somewhat different phenom-
ena are occurring in the older women and the older men.
Lack of insurance coverage, low levels of health locus of
control, and immigrant status had more deleterious effects
among the older women. In contrast, recent immigration
and bereavement had much stronger negative effects among
the older men, while having a confidant and nonrecent im-
migrant status had more protective effects. These findings
indicate that migration selection, often cited as a reason for
better physical health among immigrants (Moscicki et al.,
1989), may have a less protective influence among women
than men. It may be that earlier immigrants, primarily men,
immigrated to the United States for employment opportuni-
ties, and thus were healthier. More recent immigrants, pri-
marily women, would be more likely to have immigrated to
be with adult children, and thus would be less likely to evi-
dence any healthy immigrant effect. Similarly, older men
who had recently immigrated would be less likely to evi-
dence a healthy immigrant effect.
The differences in immigration experiences suggested by
our findings also help to identify the specific factors associ-
ated with increased risk for depressive symptoms among
the older women. We found that lack of insurance coverage
and ADL impairment had particularly negative effects
among the immigrant women, whereas they had little effect
among the women born in the United States. Recent immi-
gration also had a negative effect among the immigrant
women. Health locus of control had a much stronger effect
among the U.S.-born women, whereas having a confidant
had a more protective effect among the immigrant women.
Living alone decreased the risk among U.S.-born women,
whereas it increased the risk for immigrant women.
These findings suggest that the process of acculturation
and assimilation may be more stressful for immigrant
S206 BLACK ETAL
women than men. In addition to immigrating at later ages
and for different reasons, immigrant women may be more
likely to be caught between two cultures. Two salient fea-
tures of the Mexican American culture are familism,
wherein the central core of life is the family, and "marian-
ism," by which women are expected to be submissive,
docile, and sentimental, with specific role expectations
(Paniagua, 1994). Traditionally, Mexican American women
are the keepers of culture; they are expected to maintain
family and cultural traditions, passing on practices to chil-
dren and acting as the central force of family concerns.
Men, in contrast, are often expected to do whatever is nec-
essary to provide for the family. As a result, acculturation
may be more sanctioned for men than for women, or, at the
very least, there may be greater expectations for women to
maintain the traditional culture while functioning in the
new culture.
Another salient feature of Mexican American culture is
fatalism, the belief that individuals cannot control or pre-
vent adverse events if they are the will of God (Paniagua,
1994). In the present study, we found a low sense of health
locus of control was associated with increased risk for de-
pressive symptoms, both in bivariate and multivariate anal-
yses. This may, in part, be reflective of the effects of fatal-
ism in this cultural group, in that individuals who were
more fatalistic might have felt less control over their health
through their own actions. It also may be related in part to
the predominantly low rates of acculturation seen in this
group. Szapocznik and Kurtines (1980) postulated that
those who are underacculturated lack the necessary flexibil-
ity to cope with the psychological demands of cultural assim-
ilation. This may be the case especially among immigrant
women and recent immigrants of both genders, individuals
who may be more poorly acculturated, more socially iso-
lated, less educated, and more economically marginal than
their counterparts who are better assimilated into main-
stream American culture.
Immigrants may suffer the effects of added stress from a
variety of sources. For example, it has been postulated that
the disruption of social support systems experienced by the
immigrants may be particularly stressful (Vega et al, 1986).
Indeed, we found that among the immigrant women those
with greater household sizes were at less risk than those
who lived alone or with one other person. Another issue in-
volves the legal status of these individuals. Although we
did not assess legal status in the present study, we are aware
that many older Mexican Americans may be undocumented
aliens, which can add stress and insecurity to the already
difficult processes of immigration and assimilation.
Possible Explanations for Increased Prevalence
of Depressive Symptoms
In summary, the findings of the present study suggest a
substantially elevated risk for depressive symptoms among
older Mexican Americans. Risk factors such as gender, lack
of insurance coverage, financial strain, absence of a confi-
dant, bereavement, number of chronic health conditions,
and functional impairment were as predictive among this
group as they are among older adults in general. It is not
clear, however, if the elevated rates can be adequately ex-
plained by these traditional risk factors. Indeed, evidence
does not suggest that the sociodemographic risk factors
function any differently in this group than in other groups
of older adults. It is more likely that the elevated risks are
related to a greater prevalence of these traditional risk fac-
tors coupled with cultural factors. For example, part of the
increased risk found in the present study may be explained
by the overall level of education of the older Mexican
Americans, which is lower compared with that of other
groups. Similarly, the greater proportions of older Mexican
Americans reporting a lack of insurance coverage and fi-
nancial strain may also add to the increased prevalence. Im-
migrant status appears to be particularly influential among
recent immigrants and among older women. It does not ex-
plain the higher rates reported by the older men, however.
Can the higher rates of depression be explained in terms
of chronic conditions and associated functional impair-
ment? Evidence indicates that older Mexican Americans
may have fewer chronic conditions than older non-Hispanic
Whites or African Americans (Berkman et al., 1986; Ken-
nedy et al., 1989) but higher rates of functional impairment
(Markides et al., 1996). This suggests that the critical factor
may not be the number of medical conditions but, rather,
the nature of the conditions reported and their impact on the
lives of those afflicted. A large portion of the variability
may be explained by examining the contributions of spe-
cific chronic medical disorders that are associated more
commonly with depression, particularly those that are asso-
ciated strongly with functional declines. These include
arthritis, cancer, thyroid disease, stroke, diabetes, and car-
diovascular disease (Finch, Ramsay, & Katona, 1992; Gold-
ing & Burnam, 1990; Katon & Sullivan, 1990; Lewinsohn
et al., 1988; Ouslander, 1982), several of which are particu-
larly prevalent among older Mexican Americans. For exam-
ple, research over the past decade has increasingly demon-
strated that adult-onset diabetes mellitus, a disease that is
both highly prevalent among Mexican Americans and asso-
ciated with substantial functional disabilities, is associated
more strongly with depression than many other chronic
conditions, particularly among older adults (Gavard, Lust-
man, & Clouse, 1993; Wing, Marcus, Blair, Epstein, &
Burton, 1990). Weyerer, Hewer, Pfeifer-Kurdo, and Dilling
(1989), for example, reported the prevalence of depression
to be 27.3% among older diabetics, compared with a rate of
10.6% among healthy older adults and a rate of 20.3%
among older adults suffering from other chronic diseases.
Among the 22% of respondents in the present study who
reported a physician's diagnosis of diabetes, over 31% had
high rates of depressive symptoms. This compares with
about 26% of those with other chronic conditions and about
18% of those who reported having no chronic conditions.
Our findings highlight both similarities and differences
between older Mexican Americans and other ethnic groups
of older adults in the United States. These findings are lim-
ited, however, in two important ways. First, although the
measure of depressive symptoms used in this study, the
CES-D, is the most frequently used measure of psychologi-
cal distress in surveys of older community-dwelling adults,
it is only moderately correlated with the clinical syndrome
of depression (as delineated in the DSM-IV; American Psy-
DEPRESSION IN OLDER MEXICAN AMERICANS S207
chiatric Association, 1994). Indeed, research has indicated
that, compared with clinical diagnostic measures, symptom
scales may overestimate the prevalence of depression be-
cause they include the sequelae of age-related physical dis-
orders and increased somatic symptoms, such as sleep
or appetite disturbance (Berry, Storandt, & Coyne, 1984;
Blazer, 1982; Newman, 1989). This may be particularly rel-
evant for older Mexican Americans, who may be more
likely to express psychological problems with somatic
symptoms (Angel & Angel, 1995). Thus, it may not be ap-
propriate to generalize the results for psychological distress
into depression as a clinical disorder. Further research is
needed to examine potential risk factors using a diagnosis
of depressive disorder as the measure of outcome. Despite
this limitation, however, the present results are an important
addition to the understanding of depression, albeit subsyn-
dromal depression, among older adults, a phenomenon con-
sidered common but poorly understood (Blazer et al., 1987;
Newman, 1989).
A more important limitation is that the data presented in
this article are cross-sectional and cannot adequately reflect
longitudinal relationships between physical illness or func-
tional disabilities and depressive symptoms in older Mexi-
can Americans. An important question remains as to
whether depressive symptoms are the result of physical
health problems, whether physical illness and disability are
in part the result of psychological distress, or whether both
processes are operating concurrently, as has been suggested
by Berkman and colleagues (1986).
These limitations raise another important concern: Does
the elevated risk for depressive symptoms indicate an actual
increase in the prevalence of depression or does it reflect
some sociocultural differences not directly related to psy-
chological distress? This has not been supported either by
the reports of clinicians or by studies that have employed
diagnostic criteria, such as the Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule (DIS), which have suggested that the prevalence of de-
pression in older Mexican American adults is the same or
less than that of other older Americans (Vernon & Roberts,
1982). Data from the Hispanic HANES (Moscicki et al.,
1989) indicate that older Mexican Americans have lower
rates of major depression than other groups of older adults.
Similarly, data from the Epidemiologic Catchment Area
(ECA; Karno et al., 1987) studies indicate no greater risk
for depression (as defined by the DIS) among older Mexi-
can Americans than among older African Americans or
non-Hispanic Whites.
The ECA data did, however, demonstrate that Mexican
American women over the age of 40 were at greater risk for
dysthymia, a less severe yet more chronic depressive disor-
der (Karno et al., 1987). Recent literature has also docu-
mented an increased sociocultural acceptance among Mexi-
can Americans to express psychological stress through
somatic symptoms (Canino et al., 1992; Katon, Kleinman,
& Rosen, 1982a, 1982b). When viewed in conjunction with
the increased prevalence of sociodemographic risk factors
and the possible effects of the specific chronic medical con-
ditions most prevalent in this group, it appears likely that
the increased burden of psychological distress among older
Mexican Americans is real. We hope to better address these
issues with longitudinal analyses of the second wave of
Hispanic EPESE data.
The findings of this study are important for a number of
reasons. For clinicians and policy makers, our results iden-
tify similarities and differences between older Mexican
Americans and older adults in general. Our findings of
higher rates of depressive symptoms among older Mexican
Americans have substantial implications for the detection
and treatment of mental health in this population. More im-
portantly, however, our findings illustrate the complexity of
influences on both mental and physical health in older
adults, many of which can be modified. Addressing this
complexity benefits not only older Mexican Americans but
society as a whole.
