Uric Acid Level: The Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey

AND GARY CURHAN2
Objective. To evaluate the relationship between intakes of beer, liquor, and wine and serum uric acid levels in a
nationally representative sample of men and women.
Methods. Using data from 14,809 participants (6,932 men and 7,877 women) age >20 years in The Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994), we examined the relationship between intakes of beer, liquor, and wine
and serum uric acid levels. Alcohol intake was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire.
Results. Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing beer or liquor intake but not with increasing wine intake. After
adjusting for age, the difference in serum uric acid levels as compared with no intake increased with increasing beer or
liquor intake (P values for trend < 0.001), but the association was inverse with increasing wine intake (P for
trend < 0.001). After adjusting mutually for these alcoholic beverages and for other risk factors for hyperuricemia,
including dietary risk factors, the associations were attenuated but remained significant for beer or liquor (multivariate
difference per serving per day 0.46 mg/dl [95% confidence interval {95% CI} 0.32, 0.60] and 0.29 mg/dl [95% CI 0.14, 0.45],
respectively; both P values for trend <0.01), but not for wine (0.04 mg/dl [95% CI ­0.20, 0.11]; P for trend  0.6).
Conclusion. These data suggest that the effect of individual alcoholic beverages on serum uric acid levels varies
substantially: beer confers a larger increase than liquor, whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase serum uric
acid levels.

INTRODUCTION
Hyperuricemia is considered the precursor of gout, which
is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adult men
(1). Many studies have shown that increased alcohol in-
take is associated with hyperuricemia (2­10), but little
data are available about the effect of individual alcoholic
beverages (i.e., beer, liquor, and wine) on serum uric acid
levels. If different alcoholic beverages have different ef-
fects on serum uric acid (11), it would have practical
implications for prevention and management of hyperuri-
cemia and gout.
In a recent large prospective study of incident gout
among men, we found higher beer and liquor intake inde-
pendently increased the risk of incident gout, whereas
higher wine intake did not (12). These findings led us to
hypothesize that these beverages differentially affect se-
rum uric acid levels. To evaluate this hypothesis, we con-
ducted a cross-sectional study based on the US Third
National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey
(NHANES III) (13,14).
METHODS
Study population. Conducted between 1988 and 1994,
the NHANES III included a representative sample of the
noninstitutionalized civilian US population, which was
selected by using a multistage, stratified sampling design
(13). After a home interview, participants were invited to
attend examination sessions where blood and urine spec-
imens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the
examination for health reasons, a blood sample was ob-
tained during the home interview. We limited our analysis
to participants 20 years old who attended the medical

examination; we included the 14,809 participants (6,932
men and 7,877 women) with complete information in our
analyses. We repeated our analyses among 14,363 partici-
pants after excluding participants who self reported gout
or were taking allopurinol or uricosuric agents (n  446).
Uric acid measurement. Serum uric acid was measured
by oxidization with the specific enzyme uricase to form
allantoin and H2
O2
(Hitachi Model 737 Multichannel An-
alyzer; Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
IN). Details about quality control procedures have been
published elsewhere (14). Values are reported in milli-
grams per deciliter; to convert to moles per liter, multiply
by 59.48.
Assessment of alcoholic beverages. During the home
interview, beer, liquor, and wine intake were determined
from responses to the food frequency questionnaire ad-
ministered to participants to assess their usual consump-
tion over the past month. Food frequency questionnaire
assessment of alcohol intake has been shown to be a valid
and reliable method for assessing average consumption
(15). The average daily intakes of each alcoholic beverage
were then combined to compute total alcohol intake.
Assessment of covariates. The average daily intakes of
total meat, seafood, and dairy foods were derived from
responses to the food frequency questionnaire. Food fre-
quency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has
been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing
average dietary consumption (16,17). Total energy intake
was calculated from a single 24-hour dietary recall. The
NHANES III collected information on body measurements
(including height and weight), medication use (including
diuretics, antihypertensives, allopurinol, and uricosuric
agents), medical conditions (including self reported hyper-
tension and gout), and serum creatinine levels. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters.
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were com-
puted using survey commands of Stata (e.g., SVYMEAN
and SVYREG) to incorporate sample weights and to adjust
for clusters and strata of the complex sample design (Ver-
sion 7; Stata Corporation, College Station, TX).
We used linear regression modeling to evaluate the re-
lationship between alcohol intake and serum uric acid
level. The average daily serving for each alcoholic bever-
age intake was divided into 5 categories: 0, 0.01­0.09,
0.1­0.49, 0.5­0.99, and 1.0. We repeated our analysis
treating alcohol intake as continuous variables. Multivar-
iate models were adjusted for age; sex; total energy intake;
BMI; use of diuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uri-
cosuric agents; self-reported hypertension and gout; serum
creatinine level; and intake of total meats, seafood, and
dairy foods. Multivariate models for individual alcoholic
beverages were additionally adjusted for the other 2 indi-
vidual alcoholic beverages. Trends in serum uric acid lev-
els across categories of intake were assessed in linear re-
gression models by using the median values of each
category to minimize the influence of outliers. We con-
ducted analyses stratified by sex or BMI (25 kg/m2 versus
25 kg/m2). We evaluated potential interactions with
these variables by testing the significance of interaction
terms added to our final multivariate models with the
main effects. For all  coefficients, we calculated 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs). All P values are 2 sided.
RESULTS
Characteristics. The population mean age (SE) was 44.7
(0.5) years and mean serum uric acid level (SE) was 5.32
(0.02) mg/dl. The relevant characteristics according to al-
cohol intake are shown in Table 1. With increasing intake
of beer and liquor, the proportion of males increased.
Individuals in the highest category of liquor intake were
more likely to report hypertension and diuretic use.
Beer, liquor, and wine intake and serum uric acid lev-
els. Serum uric acid levels increased with increasing beer
or liquor intake (Table 2). After adjusting for age, the
difference in serum uric acid levels as compared with no
intake increased with increasing beer or liquor intake (P
values for trend  0.001) and the difference for the top
category (1 serving per day) was 0.99 mg/dl (95% CI
0.82, 1.17) and 0.58 mg/dl (95% CI 0.36, 0.80), respec-
tively. After adjusting for other covariates, the differences
were attenuated but remained significant for beer and li-
quor (both P values for trend  0.001). The multivariate
adjusted increase in uric acid per serving per day was 0.46
mg/dl (95% CI 0.32, 0.60) for beer and 0.29 mg/dl (95% CI
0.14, 0.45) for liquor (Table 2).
Serum uric acid levels decreased with increasing wine
intake except for the top category (1 serving per day), in
which the level was still lower than that of no use (Table
2). After adjusting for age, there was an inverse association
between wine intake and serum uric acid levels (P value
for trend  0.001) and the difference per serving per day
increase was ­0.42 mg/dl (95% CI ­0.62, ­0.22). After
adjusting for other covariates, there was no association (P
for trend  0.6) and the multivariate difference per serving
of wine per day was 0.04 mg/dl (95% CI ­0.20, 0.11)
(Table 2).
When we repeated our analyses after excluding partici-
pants who self reported gout or were taking allopurinol or
uricosuric agents (n  446), the results did not change
materially.
Total alcohol intake and serum uric acid level. Serum
uric acid level increased with increasing total alcohol in-
take (Table 2). After adjusting for age, the difference in
serum uric acid levels as compared with no intake in-
creased with increasing total alcohol intake (P values for
trend  0.001) and the difference for the top category (1
serving per day) was 0.69 mg/dl (95% CI 0.54, 0.84). After
adjusting for other covariates, the differences were atten-
uated but remained significant (both P values for
trend  0.001) (Table 2). The multivariate difference per
serving per day of total alcohol was 0.27 mg/dl (95% CI
0.19, 0.35).

Serum uric acid level according to alcoholic intake and
sex or BMI. When we stratified multivariate analyses by
sex or BMI (25 kg/m2 versus 25 kg/m2), the associations
with beer and liquor persisted in all subgroups and the
association with beer continued to be larger than that with
liquor. No association was found with wine intake in any
of the subgroups (Figure 1).
Overall, the magnitudes of association with individual
alcoholic beverages were larger among women than among
men, but only the association with liquor intake signifi-
cantly differed between sexes (multivariate difference per
serving per day 0.44 mg/dl [95% CI 0.19, 0.70] for women
and 0.30 mg/dl [95% CI 0.09, 0.51] for men; P for interac-
tion  0.03) (Figure 1). Similarly, the magnitudes of asso-
ciation were generally larger among those with BMI 25
kg/m2 than those with BMI 25 kg/m2, but only the asso-
ciation with beer intake significantly differed between the
BMI subgroups (multivariate difference per serving per
day 0.52 mg/dl [95% CI 0.30, 0.74] and 0.41 [95% CI 0.22,
0.60], respectively; P for interaction  0.02).
The association with total alcohol intake was signifi-
cantly larger among those with BMI 25 kg/m2 than
those with BMI 25 kg/m2 (multivariate difference per
serving per day 0.31 mg/dl [95% CI 0.20, 0.42] and 0.25
[95% CI 0.13, 0.36], respectively; P for interaction 
0.01), but not between sexes (P for interaction  0.19)
(Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative sample of US men and
women, we found that the serum uric acid level signifi-
cantly increased with increasing beer or liquor intake, but
not with wine intake. Furthermore, the association with
beer was larger than that with liquor. These associations
were independent of the other alcoholic beverages and of
additional risk factors for hyperuricemia, such as sex, BMI,
dietary risk factors, serum creatinine level, hypertension,
and diuretic use. These findings persisted across different
subgroups stratified by sex and BMI.
Ethanol intake has been shown to increase serum uric
acid level via both decreased urate excretion (4,18­20) and
increased production (5,6). Meanwhile, our findings sug-
gest that certain nonalcoholic components that vary across
these alcoholic beverages play an important role in serum
uric acid level. One candidate for this nonalcoholic com-
ponent is the variation in purine contents among the in-
dividual alcoholic beverages (21). Beer is the only alco-
holic beverage acknowledged to have a large purine
content, which is predominantly guanosine (21). Guano-
sine is more readily absorbed than other nucleosides, nu-
cleotides, or bases (11,21). Thus, the effect of ingested
purine in beer on the blood uric acid may be sufficient to
augment the hyperuricemic effect of alcohol itself (11,21).
There may be other nonalcoholic offending factors, partic-
ularly in beer. Wine is known to contain a number of
Figure 1. Multivariate difference in serum uric acid per daily serving of alcoholic beverages stratified by sex and body mass index (BMI).
The differences are adjusted for age; sex; total energy intake; BMI; use of diuretics, beta-blockers, allopurinol, and uricosuric agents; self
report of hypertension and gout; serum creatinine level; and intake of total meats, seafood, and dairy foods. Error bars indicate 95%
confidence intervals of the difference. Thus, if the bars cross the X-axis (unity), the respective difference is not significant (P  0.05).
Significant interactions were present for liquor intake between sexes (P for interaction  0.03) and for intake of beer or total alcohol
between the BMI subgroups (P values for interaction  0.03 and 0.01, respectively). All other P values for interaction were  0.19.
Alcohol Intake and Serum Uric Acid 1027
nonalcoholic components, including antioxidants (22­24),
vasorelaxants (25), and stimulants to antiaggregatory
mechanisms (26). Because uric acid is considered an indi-
cator for increased oxidative stress, nonalcoholic compo-
nents in wine (e.g., polyphenols with antioxidant proper-
ties) (22­24) may potentially play a role in mitigating the
impact of alcohol on serum uric acid levels. Nonetheless,
our results provide novel relevant information that mod-
erate wine drinking may not increase serum uric acid
levels.
These findings closely agree with the results of our re-
cent prospective study of incident gout based on a large
male cohort (12). In that study, we found that higher beer
and liquor intake independently increased the risk of in-
cident gout, whereas higher wine intake did not (12). We
also found that beer increased the risk of gout more than
twice that observed for liquor, even though alcohol con-
tent per serving was less for beer than liquor. The current
study findings indicate that these beverages may affect
serum uric acid levels differentially, thus causing the vari-
ation in the risk of incident gout. The fact that these
studies were based on different study populations (the
current one being nationally representative sample with
both sexes) supports the robustness of the argument.
We found that the increase in serum uric acid level
associated with beer or liquor intake tended to be larger
among women than men and also among those who were
not overweight than those who were. Confirmation of
these findings by future studies would bring more refined
and comprehensive dietary recommendations for hyper-
uricemia or gout given the emerging role of moderate al-
cohol intake in preventing coronary heart disease (27).
Strengths and limitations of our study deserve comment.
This study was performed in a nationally representative
sample of US women and men; thus, the findings are likely
to be generalizable to all US men and women. Although
the exposure range of alcohol intake in this study should
describe that of US adults, our analyses may not have
effectively addressed the association with alcohol intake
beyond moderate intake. Although we have no reason to
suspect that the associations observed in this study would
lessen in higher intake ranges of beer or liquor, we cannot
rule out the possibility that wine drinking may still have
an effect on uric acid at a higher consumption level (i.e.,
substantially higher than 1 glass per day). A cross-sec-
tional study design tends to leave uncertainty regarding
the temporal sequence of exposure­outcome relationships
and is also vulnerable to recall bias as opposed to prospec-
tive studies. If some participants reduced their alcohol
intake based on previously measured hyperuricemia, it
would lead to an underestimation of the association be-
tween alcohol intake and serum uric acid level, making
our findings conservative. In the NHANES III, the health
examination component including serum uric acid mea-
surement (outcome) was performed after the household
interview that inquired about alcohol intake during the
past month (exposure). Thus, it appears implausible that
serum uric acid levels measured in this study somehow
would systematically influence the reporting intake of
these beverages. Furthermore, differential effects among
the individual alcoholic beverages would not be explained
by these potential methodologic limitations. Our main
analysis included those with self-reported gout and those
who were taking medications to treat hyperuricemia.
Thus, if these participants reduced intake of alcohol based
on their gout diagnosis or hyperuricemia requiring treat-
ment, it would theoretically lead to an underestimation of
the association between alcohol intake and serum uric
acid level. However, exclusion of these participants did
not materially affect our results. This is likely due to the
low proportion of participants with these characteristics
(3%) or potentially due to insubstantial change in alcohol
intake after their diagnosis of gout or hyperuricemia re-
quiring treatment.
In conclusion, our results suggest that the effect of indi-
vidual alcoholic beverages on serum uric acid levels varies
substantially: beer confers a larger increase than liquor,
whereas moderate wine drinking does not increase serum
uric acid levels.
