Using the 1992 HRS, this study examines the effects of social and demographic risk factors,
including ethnicity, as well as health and job characteristics on disability and work status
among 8,701 preretirement-age Americans with work history. Analytic results indicated that
non-Anglo ethnicity was not a significant predictor of disability status but that being African
American was a strong significant predictor of being a past versus current worker. The
primary predictors of disability and work status were health behaviors, effects of health
conditions, job characteristics, and workplace adaptations, factors that lend
themselves to policy manipulation.
Key Words: Disability, Work, Ethnicity, Public policy
The Role of Ethnicity in the Disability
and Work Experience of Preretirement-
Age Americans1
Linda Ann Wray, PhD2
The literature has shown that although disability
may not preclude work, people with disabilities are
more likely to be unemployed, to work fewer hours,
or to retire earlier from the workforce than are peo-
ple without disabilities (Ficke, 1992; Martini, 1990;
Ries, 1991). A disability, however, may not be the
only -- or even main -- factor in determining
whether (or the extent to which) a person works.
Instead, the workplace may pose a greater barrier to
work status. Other factors (e.g., ethnicity, gender)
may further cloud the employment picture (see Ap-
pendix A).
The underlying reasons for different work experi-
ences among individuals with disabilities are not well
established. For example, the incidence and severity
of disability tends to be associated with certain
health conditions as well as advancing age, ethnicity,
and gender (Clark & Maddox, 1992; Ficke, 1992;
Kraus & Stoddard, 1989; LaPlante, 1988; Martini,
1990; Ries, 1991). On the other hand, positive health
behaviors and environmental adaptations may re-
duce the risk or experience of disability (Becker,
Suifbergen, Ingalsbe, & Sands, 1989; Daly & Bound,
1996; Fries etal., 1994).
In addition to pathology, health behaviors, and
environmental adaptations, work status among per-
sons with disabilities is associated with preexisting

health status, education, income, occupation, vet-
erans status (for men), and having children (for
women), as well as changes in disability-related poli-
cies (Bazzoli, 1985; Bound, Schoenbaum, & Waid-
mann, 1995; Chirikos, 1986; Hayward, Grady, Hardy,
& Sommers, 1989; Loprest, Rupp, & Sandell, 1995;
Ozawa & Law, 1992; Ruchlin & Morris, 1992; Wolfe &
Haveman, 1990).
What is not well understood is how these risk
factors affect the pathway between disease, disabil-
ity, and work, as well as whether those risk factors
remain the same over the life course and across
ethnic groups (House et al., 1990; House et al., 1994;
Jackson & Perry, 1989; Pienta, Burr, & Mutchler,
1994). Recent research on disability and work among
preretirement-age Americans found that non-Anglos
were disproportionately represented in the states,
indicating greater disability and noncurrent workers
(Wray, 1995). Given the links between work status
and pre- and postretirement economic security,
these findings may signal greater dependence on
public assistance programs in postretirement years
(Crimmins & Pramaggiore, 1988; Crystal, Shea, &
Krishnaswami, 1992; Wray, 1995).
This study's primary objectives are: (1) to investi-
gate the effects of sociodemographic, health, and
job characteristics on disability and work status
among preretirement-age Americans with work his-
tory, and (2) to discern the extent to which non-
Anglo ethnicity, in particular, affects disability and
work status.
In the following section, the study's research de-
sign and methods are described. The results of the
descriptive and multivariate analyses on current dis-
ability and work status are then presented. In the
third section, the consequences of the analytic
results for the study's research objectives are dis-

cussed. Finally, conclusions are drawn and areas for
future research are proposed.
Methods
This article's conceptual framework, deriving from
Verbrugge and Jette's (1994) model of disablement,
hypothesizes that disability status is a product of
sociodemographic risk factors, life situation, and pa-
thology. Individual health behaviors, symptoms, or
environmental adaptations may also ameliorate or
exacerbate one's disability status and, thereby, affect
one's work status. Disability and work status may
then be further modified by job characteristics, or
work- or society-level environmental adaptations.
Analyses are conducted using the Beta release data
(pre-public use) of the 1992 Health and Retirement
Study (The Health and Retirement Study, 1995) de-
signed by University of Michigan researchers and a
panel of national experts on employment, health and
function, family and social supports, as well as eco-
nomic status. The nationally representative HRS sam-
ple includes 12,654 Americans who were age 51-61 in
1992 (or spouses of the persons age 51-61). In order
to rectify past research weaknesses (e.g., insufficient
data on women, couples, and ethnic groups), some
5,000 households included married couples; in the
remaining households, women outnumbered men.
African Americans and Latinos were oversampled.
Sample Selection
The ever-worked study sample includes 8,701 per-
sons who: (1) were age 51-61 at the time of the HRS
survey interview; (2) reported a current work status
(e.g., retired, worked in the past but not currently
working, working); (3) reported that they work(ed)
for others or were self-employed (as minimal confir-
mation of their work status); and (4) reported suffic-
ient job-related data to estimate hourly wages. A
work-impaired subsample included 1,269 ever-
workers who reported that they could no longer
work or had some work limitations because of a
health problem.
Dependent Variables
Current disability status is operationalized as the
degree to which a person is limited in his or her
physical function, based on HRS questions on diffi-
culties with selected mobility/muscle skills and per-
sonal care:
1 = great difficulty with or cannot do ADLs (e.g.,
transferring, bathing/showering, dressing,
eating without help)
2 = great difficulty with or cannot do mobility/
muscle skills (e.g., walking several blocks,
getting up from a chair after an extended
period, climbing one flight of stairs without
rest, lifting or carrying at least ten pounds,
pushing or pulling a large object) or some
difficulty with ADLs
3 = some difficulty with mobility/muscle skills
4 = no difficulty with function
Current work status among preretirement-age
Americans is operationalized as:
1 = never worked
2 = retired
3 = worked in the past but currently laid off, on
sick leave, or unemployed and looking for
work and does not receive disability benefits
(e.g., Social Security Disability Insurance,
Supplemental Security Income, Veterans Ad-
ministration, and/or Workers Compensation)
4 = worked in the past but currently laid off, on
sick leave, or unemployed and looking for
work and receives disability benefits
5 = working
Independent Variables
The analytic models include independent variables
that the literature identifies as correlates (or poten-
tial correlates) of disability and work status: sociode-
mographic risk factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity),
life situation (e.g., marital status, education), pathol-
ogy (e.g., specific disease, injury, or congenital con-
dition), health behaviors (e.g., smoking, problem
drinking, regular exercise, obesity), symptoms (e.g.,
chronic pain, impaired vitality), and current or last
job characteristics (e.g., tenure, occupation, bene-
fits). The disability and work status models for the
work-impaired ever-worked subsample include
those same measures plus workplace adaptations in
the current or last job. Table 1a describes the inde-
pendent variables in greater detail.
Analyses
Two sets of analyses are conducted to answer the
study's research questions on disability and work sta-
tus: (1) univariate and bivariate procedures provide
important descriptive information on the study sam-
ple and test regression assumptions; and (2) re-
gression procedures test the effects of ethnicity,
net of other sociodemographic factors, life situation,
health conditions and behaviors, as well as job
characteristics.
Because the dependent variables are categorical,
the models are tested using multinomial logistic re-
gression, using the following equation:
ln[P(Y = j)/P(Y = J)] = aj
+ bjXi
,
where Y is the outcome variable (e.g., disability or
work status), J is the number of states in the outcome
variable (e.g., 4 states in disability status, 4 states in
work status) and j takes values from 1 to J-1, and X is
the vector of independent variables. The resulting
coefficients estimate the probabilities of being in
one of J-1 disability or work states relative to the J
state for each of the model's independent variables.
For more readily understood table presentation, the
resulting coefficients are transformed to odds ratios
through exponentiation:
odds ratio = ex,
where e represents the antilog of x and x is the
parameter estimate for each independent variable in

Although the results that follow generally support
the available literature as well as hypothesized rela-

viewed as preliminary given the cross-sectional nat-
ure of the study.
Results
Descriptive Results
As illustrated in Table 1, descriptive statistics sup-
port the available literature on disability and work in
showing considerable variation across ethnic groups
on several key characteristics.
Sociodemographic Factors and Life Situation. --
Men outnumber women among ever-workers across
all groups except African Americans. Non-Anglo/
others are disproportionately unmarried and have
fewer years of formal education.
Health Characteristics. -- Although the average
ever-worker exhibits relatively positive health behav-
iors, sizeable proportions currently smoke ciga-
rettes, exercise only sporadically, and are overweight
(e.g., body mass index greater than 28). For example,
somewhat more than one-quarter of all persons cur-
rently smoke, compared with nearly one-third of
African Americans and less than one-quarter of Lati-
nos. Nearly half of African Americans can be de-
scribed as obese, compared with about one-third of
Anglo/others.
In general, African Americans report more poten-
tially disabling health conditions, greater difficulties
with function, and more severe health symptoms
than do other ever-workers. Although Latinos tend
to have fewer health conditions than other groups,
they report disproportionately greater direct effects
of those conditions (e.g., functional difficulty), as
well as more severe indirect effects (e.g., chronic

pain, impaired vitality), as do African Americans rela-
tive to Anglo/others.
Work Status. -- Anglo/others are disproportion-
ately current workers. Anglo/others and African
Americans report they are retired more often than do
Latinos. Both African Americans and Latinos are dis-
proportionately nonretired past workers (whether
receiving disability benefits or not).
Job Characteristics. --Anglo/others are more likely
to have been employed in higher status current or
last jobs (e.g., professional, management, other
technician or administrative support), while African
Americans and Latinos are more likely to have been
employed in lower status jobs (e.g., service work or
manual labor).
African Americans report disproportionately
longer job tenure than either Anglo/others or Lati-
nos. Despite the longer tenure, however, the me-
dian hourly wage for African Americans ($9.00) was
well below that of Anglo/others ($11.30), likely a
result of lower status jobs. Hourly wages for Latinos
were even lower ($8.00). Similarly, Anglo/others tend
to report more generous employee benefit packages
(e.g., pensions, retiree health insurance) than do
non-Anglo/others.
Workplace adaptations were provided by current
or last employers somewhat more often for African
Americans than for Latinos or Anglo/others. Given
that the 1992 HRS data were collected before total
implementation of the 1990 Americans with Disabili-
ties Act (ADA) employment provisions, it will be
interesting to examine later waves of HRS data to see
what adaptation changes transpired after 1992.

functional difficulties for two sets of characteristics:
(1) sociodemographic risk factors only, and (2) so-
ciodemographic, life situation, and health behaviors,
as well as other health and job characteristics. Given
the preceding descriptive statistics, one might ex-
pect to see African Americans and Latinos reporting
greater levels of disability than would Anglo/others.
These expectations are borne out in Table 2 if one
controls only for age and gender. Once life situation
measures and health and job characteristics are con-
trolled for, however, the effects of ethnicity disappear
(Table 3). The stronger predictors of functional diffi-
culty are negative health behaviors, health condi-
tions, moderate pain, low energy, and tiredness (see
Appendix B). The odds of having functional difficul-
ties versus no difficulties are affected by few job
characteristics. For example, the odds of having diffi-
culties increase for age, from 3.4% per year (some
difficulty with mobility) to 7.7% per year (great diffi-
culty with personal care). As one might expect, higher
status nonprofessional jobs (e.g., managers, techni-
cians, administrative support) and higher hourly
wages are negative predictors of having great difficul-
ties with mobility. Although other job benefits are
largely not significant predictors of functional difficul-
ties, spousal retirement benefits increase the odds of
having great difficulty with personal care by 158%.
Analytic Results on Current Work Status
Tables 4 and 5 present the relative probabilities of
being in one of three nonworking states versus cur-
rently working in the full sample for two sets of
characteristics: (1) sociodemographic risk factors
only, and (2) sociodemographic, life situation, and
health behaviors, as well as other health and job
characteristics.
Controlling only for age and gender, non-Anglo/
other ethnicity -- particularly being Latino -- is a
significant predictor of not currently working (Table
4). For example, the odds of being retired versus
currently working decrease by 38% if one is Latino.
By contrast, the odds of being a past versus current
worker increase by 87% for Latinos not receiving
disability benefits and by 106% for Latinos receiving
disability benefits. Similarly, the odds of not working
and receiving benefits increase 200% for African
Americans.
Once other life situation, health, and job charac-
teristics are controlled for, however, the effects of
non-Anglo ethnicity on work status nearly disappear.
As shown in Table 5, the odds of being retired versus
currently working increase quite markedly for age
(by 24% per year), for problem drinkers, for three of
five health conditions, and for great difficulty with
personal care, and decrease for infrequent exercise
(see Appendix B). Non-Anglo/other ethnicity (e.g.,
African American) only affects the odds of being a
past worker who receives disability benefits.
Most of the remaining variables are significant pre-
dictors of being a past versus current worker, regard-
less of disability benefit status. For example, being
unmarried decreases the odds of not working and not
receiving benefits but increases the odds of not work-
ing and receiving benefits. Higher education de-
creases the odds of being a past worker. Negative
health behaviors are important predictors of being a
past worker without disability benefits. Histories of
circulatory and heart conditions as well as of diabetes
also increase the odds of being a past versus current
worker. Similarly, the direct and indirect effects of
those health conditions (e.g., function, pain, im-
paired vitality) are strong predictors of not currently
working, both with and without disability benefits. In
particular, great functional difficulties increase the
odds of not working and receiving benefits.
Longer condition duration decreases the odds of
being a past worker with no benefits but increases
the odds of being a past worker with benefits. Non-
professional occupations are not significant predic-
tors of previously working. Additional years of job
tenure as well as pension and retiree health insur-
ance coverage increase the odds of being a retiree
but decrease the odds of being a past versus current
worker. The odds of being a retiree or past worker
receiving disability benefits increase strongly if one's
spouse received retirement income (e.g., Social Se-
curity, pension, annuities) in 1991.
Similar patterns are repeated in the analysis of
being a past versus current worker among persons
who are work-impaired. Controlling only for age and
gender, non-Anglo/other ethnicity strongly in-

creases the odds of being a past worker (Table 6). The
odds of not working and not receiving disability
benefits also increase notably for women relative to
men. As illustrated in Table 7, however, once other
sociodemographic, health, and job characteristics
are controlled for, the effect of being Latino drops
out altogether and the effect of being African Ameri-
can decreases considerably. For example, the odds
of not working and receiving benefits increase 109%
for African Americans (compared with 273% in Table
6). Interestingly, the effect of being female strength-
ens the odds of not working and not receiving bene-
fits (from 174% to 207%), all other factors being
equal.
Education, health behaviors, and most health con-
ditions are not significant predictors of being a past
versus current worker among persons with work
impairments (as they were among ever-workers).
Similarly, the direct and indirect effects of the health
conditions are no longer as important. For example,
great difficulty with function increases the odds of
not working with disability benefits but has no effect
on- the odds of not working without benefits.
Chronic pain significantly predicts being a past

worker without benefits but not of being a past
worker with benefits.
Although pension coverage decreases the odds of
not currently working and not receiving benefits,
retiree health insurance decreases the odds of not
working and receiving benefits. As with the full ever-
worked population, the odds of being a past worker
with disability benefits increase markedly for spousal
retirement benefits. Importantly, the odds of being a
past versus current worker decrease strongly for
employer-provided workplace adaptations that help
to compensate for one's work impairments.
Discussion
What do these results imply for the study's central
question of the effect of non-Anglo ethnicity on
disability and work status among ever-workers? The
descriptive statistics clearly showed that African
Americans and Latinos had disproportionately more
potentially disabling health conditions, greater diffi-
culties with function, and more severe symptoms. In
addition, African Americans and Latinos tended to
report lower job status and wages as well as fewer job
benefits than did Anglo/others.
The study's analytic results, however, showed that
non-Anglo ethnicity was seldom a significant predic-
tor of relative disability or work status. For example,
once sociodemographic, health, and job characteris-
tics were controlled for, non-Anglo/other ethnicity
(particularly being Latino) was not the significant
predictor of disability overall that the literature and
descriptive statistics suggest. In fact, being African
American actually reduced the odds of having some
mobility difficulties versus no functional difficulties.
In contrast, net of controls, being African Ameri-
can relative to Anglo/other was linked to being a
nonretired past versus current worker who receives
disability benefits. Two points are worth noting.
First, the analyses clearly showed that disability ben-
efit receipt was associated with greater functional
difficulties and health symptoms (likely the result of
the greater functional difficulties) as well as longer
job tenure, as program eligibility criteria require.
Perhaps, as suggested by Gibson (1987), older Afri-
can Americans with work impairments choose to opt
out of the labor force by drawing disability benefits
rather than by retiring because of the economic
advantages of the disability benefits relative to retire-
ment benefits based on their lower-wage jobs.
Second, other factors -- medical and social -- may
explain why being African American still predicted
being a past versus current worker. The medical
explanation posits that there may be greater severity
or co-morbidity among African Americans that is not
accounted for in this study's models. Certainly, a
wide body of literature has shown a continuing dis-
advantage in disease-specific mortality and morbid-
ity among African Americans relative to their Anglo
counterparts (e.g., Anderson & McManus, in press;
Baquet, 1988; Kitigawa & Hauser, 1973; Rogot, Sorlie,
Johnson, Clover, & Treasure, 1988; Rogot, Sorlie,
Johnson, & Schmitt, 1992). Given that the effects of
having more than one health condition are often not
simply additive but rather exponential (Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994), the model may not be picking up the
extra hardship incurred with either the single or
multiple conditions of African Americans.
In addition, the results also support two related
social hypotheses. A loose construction of double
jeopardy holds that minority status individuals suffer
continuing and pervasive discrimination across the
lifecourse that results in poorer health in general,
unemployment or underemployment (e.g., occupa-
tional segregation), and more precarious economic
security in later life. If one is non-Anglo and also has
a potentially disabling health condition, multiple
jeopardy may result in even more dire health and
economic circumstances in the pre- and post-retire-
ment years. Similarly, the cumulative disadvantage
perspective contends that health, economic, and
social disadvantages early in life may interact
throughout the life course to persist -- and perhaps
intensify -- later in life (Crystal & Shea, 1990).
If non-Anglo ethnicity is seldom a significant pre-
dictor of disability or work status (at least in cross-
section), what characteristics are? The study's pri-
mary findings focus on four individual- and
work-level factors that the study hypothesized either
mediate or exacerbate disability and work status:
(1) health behaviors, (2) direct and indirect effects of
health conditions, (3) job characteristics, and (4)

workplace adaptations. These factors can lend them-
selves to policy manipulation if borne out in future
longitudinal analyses.
For example, obesity was a strong predictor of
having functional difficulties among ever-workers.
Similarly, problem drinking and smoking increased
the odds of being a nonretired past worker not re-
ceiving disability benefits. These results support
health promotion programs aimed at improving
overall health and worker productivity.
Even more important, the effects of specific health
conditions, rather than the health conditions them-
selves, were more often the stronger predictors of
whether a person is limited in function or currently
works. This finding leads to two conclusions: (1) the
effects would be nonexistent or lessened in the ab-

sence of the health conditions, and (2) ameliorating
or reducing the effects of those conditions -- when
they do exist -- is an important objective in increas-
ing abilities in daily life activities, including work. In
highlighting the links between chronic symptoms,
function, and work, findings of this study support
recent legislative and employer moves to provide for
chronic as well as acute care in Medicare, Medicaid,
and private health care policies. Such chronic care
may include disease prevention, health promotion,
pain management, and environmental supports.
The study also found that more generous job ben-
efits -- particularly pension coverage, retiree health
insurance, and spousal retirement benefits -- ap-
peared to afford workers the opportunity to retire
earlier than the traditional "on-time" retirement age
or to be otherwise unemployed (particularly when
drawing disability benefits as well). As future waves
of HRS data are available, it will be important to
determine the extent to which these benefits affect
retirement decision making, as well as both pre- and
post-retirement economic security.
Finally, workplace adaptations were shown to
be powerful predictors of whether work-impaired
individuals remained in the workforce. This impor-
tant and timely -- although preliminary -- finding
supports recent studies on the effectiveness of em-
ployer-provided accommodations (Daly & Bound,
1996), as well as the intentions of the employment
provisions of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities
Act.
Conclusions
This study found that health behaviors and condi-
tion effects as well as job benefits and workplace
adaptations -- rather than non-Anglo ethnicity -- are
the stronger predictors of whether a person is lim-
ited in his or her physical function or whether that
person works. These results have potentially impor-
tant implications for modifying current disability pol-
icies in this country. Analyses of future waves of HRS
data will paint a richer longitudinal picture, provid-

ing further support for, or raising questions about,
this study's findings and policy recommendations.
For example, are the predictors of work status the
same as the predictors of levels of work effort (e.g.,
296 The Gerontologist
part time versus full time)? Are all workplace adapta-
tions equally effective in keeping workers on the
job? How do changes in physical or psychological
function affect work status? Will the structural shifts
in the labor market (i.e., from manufacturing to ser-
vices, with a corresponding increase in demand for
workers with greater education and job skills) exac-
erbate the work experiences of persons with disabili-
ties in the future?
This study also found some disparities in work
status for non-Anglo ethnicity that may be inter-
preted as troubling indicators of postretirement ec-
onomic /nsecurity, pointing to several future re-
search questions. What factors -- other than those
presented in the study models -- might explain the
role of ethnicity in disability and work status? If
chronic conditions are appearing at younger ages for
non-Anglos than for Anglos (Crimmins, Saito, & In-
gegneri, 1987), it may be that the conditions are
experienced differently across ethnic groups as well
as by gender within groups. Do social support sys-
tems vary, "affording" some individuals with work
limitations the opportunity to not work at all or leave
the workforce earlier, regardless of job benefit pack-
ages? Teasing out what may be true biological differ-
ences in the expression and experience of health
conditions from other individual-level factors (e.g.,
health behaviors) and society-level factors (e.g., po-
sition in the social stratification system, lingering
racism, sexism, or prejudice toward those with dis-
abilities) remains an important research goal.
President Clinton asserted in both his 1995 and
1996 State of the Union addresses that people who
are able to work should work. Although he was
talking more specifically about welfare benefit recipi-
ents, he could just as easily have been talking about
disability benefits recipients. According to consist-
ent evidence in the literature, the majority of persons
in both groups (as well as many older adults) would
prefer working over not working, providing there are
desirable jobs available. Just as it is important to add
muscle to the welfare-to-work directives, it is also
critical to add muscle to the disabled-to-work direc-
tives in the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act as
well as other disability policies.

Although both ethnicity and gender are often treated as
biological characteristics, they are more accurately com-
plex interactions of biological, cultural, socioeconomic,
and structural factors.
As social constructs, the labels used to describe popula-
tion groups have changed over time and often across
regions. The author uses the labels African American,
Latino and Anglo/other throughout this article as ethnic
identifiers.
Appendix B
Because this study is cross-sectional, we cannot know
for certain the causal order of some of these measures,
particularly between health conditions or behaviors and
function. For example, lack of exercise may foster func-
tional difficulty; conversely, functional difficulty may pre-
clude certain types of exercise.
Similarly, the causal ordering of health characteristics,
job characteristics, and work status may also be unclear.
For example, although certain health conditions may limit
job type or work status, job type may contribute to health
conditions. Repetitive tasks and decreased authority are
characteristic of both lower status jobs (e.g., service work,
manual labor) and high blood pressure, a major contribu-
tor to heart disease and stroke. That non-Anglos are dis-
proportionately represented in lower status jobs may
partly explain the higher rates of high blood pressure,
heart disease, and stroke (Anderson & McManus, in press;
Waitzman & Smith, 1994).
