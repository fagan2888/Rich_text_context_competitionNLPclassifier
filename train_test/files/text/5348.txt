Protests at national party conventions have long been a part
of the political landscape in the United States. For example,
on June 8, 1908, Samuel Gompers, President of the
American Federation of Labor, led a march for labor rights
outside the Republican National Convention (RNC) in
Chicago (Staff, 1908). Over the years, conventions have
seen protests for woman suffrage, civil rights, farm subsi-
dies, peace in Vietnam and Iraq, the right to life and the
right to choose, tighter financial regulations on banks, and
many other issues.Activists travel to conventions to express
their viewpoints because these gatherings symbolize the
parties as institutions in a way that no other events do
(Edelman, 1964: 95).Activists are often motivated to mobi-
lize outside conventions because it is a relatively easy way
to seize media coverage for their causes (Sobieraj, 2011).
Convention protests have been especially contentious in the
2000s, which have seen frequent clashes between protest-
ers and police, as well as mass arrests (Hermes, 2015).
Despite the regular appearance of convention protests
during the presidential election cycle, relatively little is
known about why individuals participate in this type of
activism. Are they there to help or hurt a candidate? To pro-
mote an issue? To express themselves? To see friends? Or
some mixture of all of these? What factors shape these
motivations? This lacuna is unfortunate because protest
organizers are among the policy demanders that work to
shape party coalitions (Bawn et al., 2012). Through these
protests, parties and movements meet in the streets outside
the conventions in a tangible way. A sizeable body of
research has emerged on how leaders in parties and move-
ments influence one another (see, e.g., Clemens, 1997;
Frymer, 1999; Schlozman, 2015). Yet, how parties and
movements affect, and are affected by, rank-and-file activ-
ists remains less-explored territory (but see Heaney and

Abstract
Protests at national party conventions are an important setting in which political parties and social movements
challenge one another. This article examines the motivations of participants in these events. Drawing upon data
from surveys of protesters outside the 2008 national party conventions, it focuses on how partisan and independent
political identifications correspond with the reasons that individuals give for protesting. The results demonstrate that
there are some conditions under which independents place a greater focus on issues than do partisans and under
which partisans place a greater focus on presidential candidates than do independents. However, there are also
conditions under which independents are inclined to work alongside partisans, such as trying to stop the election
of a threatening candidate and in championing an issue outside their opposing party's convention. The article argues
that micro-level partisan identifications are thus likely to affect the broader structure of party coalitions. These
considerations promise to become increasingly relevant as social movements ­ such as the Tea Party, Occupy Wall
Street, and Black Lives Matter ­ launch new campaigns against or within established parties.

Rojas, 2007, 2015; Layman et al., 2010; Skocpol and
Williamson, 2012).
In examining this topic, Fabio Rojas and I (Heaney and
Rojas, 2007, 2015) theorize that political parties and social
movements sometimes come together in a social space that
we call "the party in the street." This space provides an
opportunity for activists to pressure a party to pursue a
movement's issues and, reciprocally, to pressure the move-
ment to support a party's candidates. We argue that partisan
identification draws activists into politics when it serves the
party's interests, but also pushes activists out of politics
when their involvement no longer serves the party's goals.
Thus, we see a trade-off between party and movement
activism ­ which is largely to the advantage of parties ­ at
least during periods of high partisan polarization. However,
this empirical analysis is limited by the fact that it focuses
on issue involvement without considering the actions that
activists may try to help or hurt candidates directly.
Samara Klar and Yanna Krupnikov (2016) also examine
how partisan identification affects political participation,
though they stress the consequences of the decision by an
increasing number of citizens to identify as independents,
who avoid making public commitments to one of the major
parties. They argue that even though independents may
tend to vote as if they are loyal partisans, their embarrass-
ment with the parties and with contemporary politics may
motivate them to refrain from disclosing their partisan lean-
ings. In particular, independents tend to avoid the kind of
interpersonal activism that promotes the flow of partisan
ideas through social networks, such as talking to friends
about politics and displaying partisan bumper stickers, yard
signs, and buttons. This avoidance of partisan engagement
on the part of independents is an impediment to the parties'
efforts to win elections and govern.
In contrast to Heaney and Rojas's (2007, 2015) claim
that parties gain from the participation of independents
when they are allied with partisans, Klar and Krupnikov
emphasize that parties lose when independent identifiers do
not participate in politics. Yet, Klar and Krupnikov do not
examine what happens when independents do participate in
partisan politics. How is their participation different from
that of party identifiers? Moreover, their empirical analysis
focuses on actions that independents may or may not take
to help candidates, but does not consider the potentially
powerful actions that independents may take to hurt
candidates.
In this article, I argue that combining the Heaney­Rojas
and Klar­Krupnikov perspectives on partisan and inde-
pendent identifications provides significant insights into
the competing motivations of protesters outside the national
party conventions. It considers that activists may act to help
or hurt a candidate, or speak out on an issue, within the
same analysis. I argue that partisan identification ­ or its
absence ­ affects the mixed conditions under which activ-
ists seek to be a resource to parties or movements.
The article proceeds, first, by discussing the role of par-
tisan identification and independence in individuals' par-
ticipation in activism. Second, it outlines the research
design based on a survey of demonstrators outside the 2008
national party conventions. Third, it presents descriptive
survey results. Fourth, it reports estimates of probit models
for protest motivation. It concludes by considering how
political parties and social movements relate to one another
at the grassroots level.
Partisans, independents, and activism
Political activism is a widely prevalent form of political
participation, though it receives substantially less attention
than does voting behavior. Activism reflects individuals'
involvement in politics that takes place informally, such as
by participating in demonstrations, writing about issues
online, organizing citizens' groups, and writing letters to
elected officials. Using data from a longitudinal study of
activism from 1965 to 1997, Catherine Corrigall-Brown
(2012) reports that approximately two-thirds of Americans
engage in some form of political activism over their life-
times. Schlozman et al. (2012) argue that this activism
redirects the attention of politicians away from the prefer-
ences of the median voter and toward the causes champi-
oned by activists.
I argue that partisan identification ­ or the lack thereof
­ is closely linked with the ways that individuals make
sense of their participation in political activism. People that
identify closely with a political party may turn to party poli-
tics to understand and explain their involvement in activ-
ism. They are more likely to be attracted to the competitive
aspects of elections that are integral to party politics
(Schattschneider, 1960).
People who describe themselves as independents are
likely to have different types of concerns about politics than
do partisans.As Klar and Krupnikov (2016) point out, inde-
pendents may be put off by the conflictual aspects of poli-
tics to a degree that self-identified partisans may not be.
However, they may also reject partisan identities because
they are cross-pressured on issues with which they strongly
identify (Magleby and Nelson, 2012). Social identities
related to these issues, then, may help to motivate protest
participation (Polletta and Jasper, 2001). Convention pro-
tests usually have a strong issue orientation that is likely to
amplify these motivations. As a result, the independents
who protest at conventions may not be in the "middle of the
road" between the Democratic and Republican parties.
Rather, they may identify as independents because there is
at least one issue on which they do not think that the parties
are extreme enough.
Building on these arguments, it is possible to state a
series of hypotheses related to partisan identification, inde-
pendence, and the motivation of individuals for participat-
ing in activism outside conventions. First, partisans at
Heaney 3
convention protests are likely to want to help the presiden-
tial candidate of their party, especially if they are attending
the convention at which that candidate is nominated. Thus:
H1
: Partisans are more likely than independents to be
motivated by the desire to help a candidate if they are
protesting at their more-proximate party's convention.
Second, it is possible that activists protest to hurt the
chances of the candidate from the other party. They are
more likely to see the opportunity to do so if they are attend-
ing the convention of the opposing party. Thus:
H2
: Partisans are more likely than independents to be
motivated by the desire to hurt a candidate if they are
protesting at their more-distant party's convention.
Third, partisans and independents are likely to be differ-
ently motivated by issues. Because their energy is drawn
into the competitive aspects of partisan politics, partisans
are less likely to articulate their motivations explicitly in
issue terms. In contrast, independents are more likely to see
issues as closer to their political identities. These propensi-
ties underlie the trade-off between party and movement
activism. Thus:
H3
: Partisans are less motivated to protest by issue con-
siderations than are independents.
Underlying these hypotheses is the more general hypothe-
sis that independents are differently motivated than parti-
sans in attending protests. Independents generally eschew
working to affect the chances of candidates and instead
concentrate on their issue concerns. Thus:
H4
: Partisans and independents are differently moti-
vated to protest in that partisans place a greater empha-
sis on candidates and independents place a greater
emphasis on issues.
Convention protest surveys
This study is based on surveys conducted of protesters out-
side the 2008 RNC in St Paul, Minnesota and 2008
Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Denver,
Colorado. The attitudes of the participants in the protests
were assessed using a five-page, pencil-and-paper survey.1
The questions queried individuals' motivations for partici-
pating in the protest, partisan identification, ideology, emo-
tional engagement in politics, social networks with other
protesters, where they live, sex/gender, race/ethnicity, age,
level of education, and annual income, as well as other atti-
tudinal and demographic questions.
Surveys were collected at all protests using the "anchor
sampling" method developed by Heaney and Rojas (2007,
2014, 2015) as an adaptation of exit-poll sampling. The sur-
vey team began by distributing itself throughout the major
regions of the crowd. Surveyors were instructed to look
into the crowd and select a person to serve as an "anchor"
for their counting process. This anchor could be anyone
they preferred, though the anchor would not be surveyed on
the understanding that s/he might be selected with bias.
From the anchor, surveyors counted five persons to the
right, and then issued a survey invitation; again, counted
five to the right, then issued a survey invitation, continuing
until three individuals had accepted the survey. Once three
surveys were completed, the surveyor selected a new
anchor and repeated the procedures. Non-responses were
recorded for the purpose of tabulating response rates.
Research shows that if these surveys are conducted with
attention to ensuring random selection and account for
biases in non-response, then they can generate samples that
are a good representation of the individuals attending the
protest (Walgrave and Verhulst, 2011).
Who are convention protesters?
The survey yielded 412 respondents from the DNC, with a
response rate of 65 percent, and 990 respondents from the
RNC, with a response rate of 77 percent. All of the analysis
reported here is weighted according to differences in
response rates and accounts for different variances in the
two strata of the survey (i.e. the DNC and the RNC).
The partisan breakdown of protest participants is pro-
vided in Figure 1. The distribution has a strong, overall
skew toward non-Republicans. Republicans and people
who lean Republican made up about 6 percent of protesters
at the RNC and 11 percent of protesters at the DNC.Among
other participants, there was a greater percentage of inde-
pendents at the DNC and a greater percentage of Democrats
at the RNC. Roughly 36 percent of protesters at the RNC
were independents, as were 44 percent of respondents at the
DNC. Democrats and Democratic leaners made up 45 per-
cent of protesters at the DNC and 57 percent at the RNC.
Respondents were asked "Which are the most important
reasons that you decided to come to this convention?" They
were shown a list of 12 options (plus "other") and asked to
circle up to three of them. This article focuses on three of
these options: (1) "To help a candidate win this year's pres-
idential election"; (2) "To help prevent a candidate from
winning this year's presidential election"; and (3) "To
express my view on a particular issue or issues."
Respondents who indicated that they were motivated by
issues were also asked to "Please specify the top issues."
Selected motivations are reported by convention in
Figure 2.2 Respondents were more likely to seek to help a
candidate at the DNC (14%) than at the RNC (10%) and
more likely to seek to hurt the chances of a candidate at the
RNC (18%) than at the DNC (7%). However, issues pro-
vided a more powerful source of inspiration for these
4 Research and Politics 
respondents.3 Approximately 32 percent of DNC protesters
and 44 percent of RNC protesters were motivated by
issues.4 War and peace was the issue most commonly men-
tioned, with 27 percent of respondents volunteering this
motivation. There was a significant fall-off after war/peace,
with 6 percent concerned about the economy, 5 percent
mentioning health, 4 percent calling for group rights, 3 per-
cent pointing to problems with the environment, and all
other issues falling below this threshold.
Models of protest motivation
This article estimates three probit regression models of pro-
test motivation: one for helping a candidate, one for hurting
the chances of a candidate, and one for issue motivation.
Complete-case imputation (Little, 1988) was used to
replace the values of missing data, which is an appropriate
method given the low percentage of missing data (King
et al., 2001).
Each equation includes the same independent variables.
The first focus variable is More-Proximate Party
Convention. This variable takes the value of 1 if a Strong
Democrat, Not Very Strong Democrat, or Independent Who
Leans Democrat is protesting the DNC; or, if a Strong
Republican, Not Very Strong Republican, or Independent
Who Leans Republican is protesting the RNC; 0 otherwise.
The second focus variable is More-Distant Party
Convention. This variable takes the value of 1 if a Strong

Democrat, Not Very Strong Democrat, or Independent Who

Republican, Not Very Strong Republican, or Independent
Who Leans Republican is protesting the DNC; 0 otherwise.
The implicit excluded category is independent, which com-
bines both middle-independent category and the other-
independent category.
The remaining variables are included for the purpose
of statistical control. Ideology is measured on a 9-point
ordinal scale from left to right, with "To the `right' of
strong conservative" receiving a score of 9 and "To the
`left' of strong liberal" receiving a score of 1. Enthusiasm
about Politics and Anxiety about Politics are included in
order to account for positive and negative emotional
engagement with the political process. They are measured
on a 5-point ordinal scale, with people reporting enthusi-
asm and anxiety "Almost Always" receiving a 5 and peo-
ple who "Never" experience enthusiasm and anxiety
receiving a 1. Social Networks at Protest accounts for the
possibility that people that perceive that they are well con-
nected at the protest may be motivated differently than
people that perceive that they are poorly connected at the
protest. Live in State of Convention controls for the pos-
sibility that local people are differently motivated than
those that travel a considerable difference to protest the
convention. Sex/Gender takes the value of 1 for women
and 0 for men. Race/Ethnicity takes the value of 1 for
whites and 0 for nonwhites. Age is measured in years.
Education is measured on a 6-point ordinal scale, with
"Graduate or professional degree" receiving a score of 6
and "Less than high school diploma" receiving a score of
1. Income is measured in thousands of dollars for 2007.
Probit results are reported in Table 1. The estimates in
equation (1) are consistent with H1
. They show that when
partisans are protesting at their more-proximate party con-
vention, they are more likely than independents to do so
for the purpose of helping a candidate for president.
Additionally, consistent with H4
, the results show that par-
tisans protesting at their more-distant party's convention
are also more likely than independents to want to help a
candidate for president. That is, they may see their protest
of the opposing party directly in terms of being helpful to
their home party. On this point, independents are clearly
different from partisans: they are very unlikely to protest
with the intention of helping a candidate. Only about 6 per-
cent of independents reported doing so.
The estimates in equation (2) are consistent with H2
.
They show that when partisans are protesting at their more-
distant party's convention, they are more likely than inde-
pendents to work to hurt the chances of a candidate.
However, the results are not entirely consistent with H4
.
The estimates reveal that independents are significantly
more likely than partisans attending their more-proximate
party's convention to protest with the intention to hurt the
chances of a candidate. Thus, rather than being strictly less
interested in candidate politics than are partisans, inde-
pendents occupy a middle ground. About 10 percent of
independents were motivated to stop a candidate, which
was more than the 4 percent of partisans at their more-
proximate convention and less than the 25 percent of parti-
sans at their most-distant convention.
The estimates in equation (3) support H3
. They demon-
strate that partisans at their more-proximate party conven-
tion are less likely than independents to protest because of
issue concerns. However, again, the results are not entirely
consistent with H4
. There is no statistically significant dif-
ference in the degree to which they are motivated by issues
between independents and partisans when they are attend-
ing their more-distant party's convention. About 40 percent
of independents and 46 percent of partisans at their more-
distant convention came out due to issues. In contrast, only
28 percent of partisans at their more-proximate convention
mentioned issues as one of their reasons.
The effects of the control variables exhibited variation
across the equations. Anxiety about politics had significant,
positive correlations across all three equations, though
enthusiasm about politics only significantly contributes to
helping a candidate. Women were more likely than men to
be motivated by issue politics and to hurt the chances of a
candidate, but were no different from men in wanting to
help a candidate. Older respondents were more likely than
younger respondents to be motivated by issues, but age was
not associated with differences in motivations about
affecting candidates' chances. Ideology, Social Networks
at Protest, Live in State of Convention, Race/Ethnicity,
Education, and Income were not significantly related to the
dependent variables in any of the equations.
Given that the largest group of issue-focused protesters
were concerned with issues of war and peace, I considered
what would happen if this group was removed from the
analysis. The results of this alternative specification are
presented in Table 2. The pattern of direction and signifi-
cance (or lack thereof) matches the main analysis for five of
six coefficients that were the focus of the hypothesis tests.
From these results, we can conclude that if issues of war
and peace moved off the agenda (which, for example, was
largely the case during the 2016 convention protests), the
effects of partisan and independent identities would likely
remain very similar.
Conclusion
The results of this study exhibit consistencies and incon-
sistencies with the extant literature. Consistent with Klar
and Krupnikov (2016), the results show that independents
are much less likely than partisans to work to help a can-
didate. Likewise, consistent with Heaney and Rojas
(2015), the results demonstrate a trade-off between issues
and party activism, as protesting at one's own party con-
vention is associated with candidate, rather than issue,
6 Research and Politics 
motivations. However, in contrast to the argument of Klar
and Krupnikov, the results reveal that independents are
more prone than some partisans to protest with the inten-
tion of stopping a candidate. One possible explanation,
suggested by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky,
1979), is that independents are more likely to join the par-
tisan fray if they see the need to stop a loss (i.e. the elec-
tion of a bad candidate), than to achieve a gain (i.e. the
election of their preferred candidate). Thus, it may be pre-
sumptuous to count independents completely out of parti-
san politics. In contrast to Heaney and Rojas, the results
indicate there is not necessarily a trade-off between party
and issue activism when partisans are protesting their
most-distant party's convention, where partisans are often
fighting for issues right beside independents.
It is a mistake to see independents as having abandoned
electoral politics; though, under certain conditions, they do
exhibit less concern than do partisans. Yet it must also be con-
sidered that a growing share of independents in the population
represents an opportunity for movements. If movements can
mobilize people based on issue identities ­ rather than partisan
identities ­ then they may better withstand the vicissitudes of
partisan politics. Advocates truly committed to issues may be
more likely to push back against parties, even when their
more-preferred party is in office, thus sowing the seeds for
increased relevance by movements in American politics.

Looking to the future, both the Democratic and
Republican parties in the United States are facing increased
contention from social movements ­ such as the Tea Party,
Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter ­ some of
which is likely to manifest itself through convention pro-
tests. Politically oriented scholars would be well-advised to
be attentive to these dynamics in order to understand how
organized (and disorganized!) groups may be disruptive to
party coalitions.
