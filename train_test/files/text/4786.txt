Introduction
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a blood malignancy that
mainly affects patients 55 to 84 years old, with an average
5-year survival rate of 25%.1,2 Since the late 1970s, a com-
mon first-line chemotherapy (C/T) regimen for the treat-
ment of AML has been the so-called "7+3," composed of
cytarabine and daunorubicin.3-5 Induction and consolidation
therapies have been developed throughout the past 4
decades, with additions such as idarubicin and cyclophos-
phamide as well as target therapies such as sorafenib,
together with many other fine-tunings for different risk
groups.6 Complete remission rates of C/T vary between
60% and 80%, and the advent of hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation (HSCT) has provided a treatment option for
patients who are C/T refractory or present with unfavorable
karyotypes.7,8 However, studies show that whether it is C/T
or HSCT, long-term survival rates for adult AML patients
are grim and stand at 20% to 40%.9 All these make AML the

Abstract
Purpose. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most deadly subtype of leukemia, and many patients with this disease seek
other complementary therapies, one of which is Chinese medicine. We set out to provide reliable data regarding the
benefit of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for AML patients, using mortality as the main outcome measure. We also
characterized the herbal prescriptions of patients. Methods. Using the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research
Database, we performed a nationwide population-based cohort study among AML patients from 1997 to 2010. The Cox
regression model was used to adjust for comorbidities and other variables, and the hazard ratios (HRs) of CHM users and
non­CHM users were compared. Results. After 1:1 matching, 498 patients were included into the study. The HR of the
CHM group was 0.41 (95% CI = 0.26-0.65; P = .0001) compared with the non-CHM group. This decrease in HR was also
shown to be dose dependent (P < .001). The 3 single-herbs most commonly prescribed were Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen),
Astragalus membranaceus (Huang Qi), and Spatholobus suberectus (Ji Xue Teng). The 3 mutli-herb products most commonly
prescribed were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Gui Pi Tang, and Qi Ju Di Huang Wan. Conclusion. Prospective controlled clinical
data is still needed, however, this study provides real-world data regarding the benefit AML patients may have from CHM.
This study suggests that all AML patients, regardless of age or other prognostic factors, may achieve longer survival times
when receiving CHM in addition to standard therapy.

deadliest subtype of leukemia, accounting for 42% of deaths
among leukemia patients in the United States, testifying to
the need for additional ways to manage this disorder.10
Although Chinese medicine (CM) is growing in popular-
ity as a treatment for various conditions, there is still a long
way to go before it is accepted by the mainstream biomedi-
cal community. Consequently, there is little interest among
researchers to challenge CM in a clinical setting, and the
sparse material available regarding CM in the context of
AML consists of basic cell-line experiments.11,12 A system-
atic review published in 2013 retrieved nearly 3000 reported
Chinese clinical trials using CM for cancer. Many of these
did not use international standards such as CONSORT or
TREND and were not peer reviewed, rendering the few
studies that might relate to leukemia and AML dubious.13
This, in turn, creates a situation where primary caretakers
are unable to provide educated advice to the patients seek-
ing further complementary therapies.
Fortunately, real-world data are available on this topic.
According to past data from Taiwan, for example, where
CM is available as part of the National Health Insurance
(NHI) since 1996, at least 60% of the population had uti-
lized CM services.14 This is a substantial amount of data
considering that 99% of Taiwanese are covered by the
NHI.15 The NHI recognizes 3 major modalities of CM treat-
ment: (1) Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) products, which
come in the form of single-herb or multiherb products; (2)
acupuncture, which also encompasses moxibustion and
cupping; and (3) manual therapy, including acupressure,
Tuina, and chiropractic.16 Since some of these modalities
are harder to accurately reproduce than others, in this study
we chose to focus on CHM.
All treatments reimbursed as part of the NHI are regis-
tered in the Taiwanese NHI Research Database (NHIRD).
This dataset provides a nationwide population-based claims
database with long-term follow-up, thus reducing the poten-
tial for sampling bias. We have previously investigated the
use of CHM therapy in diseases such as chronic myeloid leu-
kemia,17 diabetes mellitus,18 rheumatoid arthritis,19 asthma,20
and peptic ulcer disease.21 In the current study, we sought to
provide insight into the potential of integration of CHM ther-
apy for patients withAML, through a nationwide population-
based retrospective cohort study, comparing CHM users and
nonusers, using mortality as the outcome measure.
Methods
Database
The NHIRD contains information regarding each clinical
visit and hospitalization incident of all its beneficiaries as
well as treatment received and drugs or CHM prescribed.
All diseases in the NHIRD are classified using the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM). In this study, we made
use of the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients file for
collection of data. This file is linked to all inpatient and out-
patient claims for catastrophic illness patients. This file
included all available NHI records of AML patients in
Taiwan as well as all the treatments reimbursed for both
standard and CM therapies. For an AML patient to be regis-
tered in this file, their diagnosis must be reviewed by a
licensed hematologist or oncologist, ensuring the confirmation
of disease. After identifying patients through this data set we
searched these patients' corresponding information, including
comorbidities, in the NHIRD inpatient and outpatient files. It is
important to note that only treatments administered by trained
and licensed CM physicians are recorded in the NHIRD.
Study Population
All patients 18 years old and above, diagnosed with AML
(ICD-9-CM: 205.0), between January 1997 and December
2010, were included. End of follow-up time was defined as
December 31, 2011. Both groups were matched according
to age, sex, and index year.
In this study, we excluded patients who had not received
any form of standard therapy. During this process of exclu-
sion, we discovered that many patients had begun a course
of treatment prior to their AML diagnosis being entered into
the NHIRD. We, therefore, also included any patient who
had received C/T or radiotherapy within 6 months prior to
their formal AML diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
In this study, SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was
used for statistical analysis of all information retrieved from
the NHIRD. The statistical differences between the two
groups were determined through the 2 or Fisher exact test
for categorical variables, and the independent t test was
used for continuous variables. Exploratory analyses of haz-
ard ratios (HRs) were performed through a Cox propor-
tional hazard model, taking into account age, gender,
urbanization level, and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI),
with a 95% CI. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used
for categorical covariates. Only P values <.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant.
Ethical Considerations
This study was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki
Declaration guidelines. The data sets obtained from the
NHIRD were encrypted and deidentified for the protection
of patient privacy, and the identification of individuals was
impossible by any means. The Research Ethics Committee
of China Medical University and Hospital approved this
study (CMUH104-REC2-115).

Results
A total of 4825 patients were diagnosed with AML within
the years 1997-2010, and after excluding those who did not
meet the study's inclusion criteria, 2757 patients remained.
These patients were grouped according to a cut-point of a
minimal 30 days of accumulated use of CHM. In our initial
results, the non-CHM group contained significantly more
patients older than 60 years. Because the majority of
patients older than 65 years do not receive C/T in Taiwan,
this posed a substantial risk for statistical a artifact. We
were, thus, obliged to randomly match the patients by age
(by 5-year intervals) at the cost of sample size. In addition,
both groups were matched according to sex and index year,
resulting in 249 patients in both the CHM group and the
non-CHM group (Figure 1).
Characteristics of patients in both groups can be seen in
Table 1. The frequency of women was higher in the two
groups (56%). The mean age of patients was 46 years, with
51.8% of the patients between the ages 40 and 59 years,
36.9% between 18 and 39 years, and 11.2% aged 60 to 85
years. The NHIRD records the urbanization level of the
location where treatment occurred. As the level of urbaniza-
tion may correlate with socioeconomic status, adding this
item bears meaning, and no statistical difference (P < .05)
was found to exist between the CHM and non-CHM groups
in this respect. Also, no statistical differences were found
between the two groups in terms of type of treatment
received (radiotherapy, C/T, or stem cell transplant) and CCI
score, which has been shown to be related to survival time in
AML patients.22 Mean follow-up times were 1.99 and 4.23
years for the non-CHM and CHM groups, respectively.
Table 2 presents the related HR of the items listed in
Table 1, as determined through a Cox proportional hazard
model. After adjusting for age, gender, urbanization level,
CCI, and treatment received, the HR of morbidity in the
CHM group was 0.29 (95% CI = 0.23-0.37; P < .0001) com-
pared with that of the non-CHM group. An additional factor
that may influence the efficacy of CHM is the delay between
the time of diagnosis and initiation of CHM treatment,
defined by some as "lag time to treatment." The lag time to
treatment may differ from patient to patient, and its influ-
ence on the improvement of prognosis has been discussed in
previous studies.23 We, therefore, took lag time to CHM
treatment into account in Table 2, and the adjusted HR was
0.41 (95% CI = 0.26-0.65, P = .0001). Through the records
in the NHIRD we were able to track the cumulative days of
CHM administered to patients, and thus in Table 3, we
investigated a further aspect of reduction in HR. It is shown
that patients who took CHM for 30 to 89 days had a HR of
0.39 (95% CI = 0.29-0.52, P < .001) compared with patients
from the non-CHM group; patients who took CHM for 90 to
179 days had a HR of 0.30 (95% CI = 0.19-0.47; P < .001),
and patients who took CHM for more than 180 days had a
HR of 0.13 (95% CI = 0.08-0.22; P < .001). In addition, we
analyzed the average time from AML diagnosis to com-
mencement of CHM treatment. Following AML diagnosis,
median times for patients from the CHM group to begin
herbal therapy were 220, 222, and 197.5 days for the first
group (30-89 days), second group (90-179 days), and third
group (>180 days), respectively. This is also illustrated in
Figure 2.
The longer survival time of the CHM group can be seen
in 2 Kaplan-Meier plots. Figure 3 illustrates the difference
in survival time between the two groups, with the CHM
group displaying superior outcomes (P < .0001). Figure 4
stratifies the groups according to patient age. It is clear that
each age subgroup from the CHM group achieved longer
survival time compared with the respective non-CHM sub-
group (P < .0001).

number of AML patients registered in the NHIRD (n = 5955),
4825 patients were diagnosed within the years 1997-2010. After
the exclusion process, as well as matching 1:1 by age, sex, and
index year, both groups contained 249 patients.

CHM is available to all patients of the NHI as concen-
trated granulated powders manufactured by pharmaceuti-
cal companies with GMP certification, which ensures the
quality and consistency of product batches. Single-herb
products are produced by extracting 1 single substance,
whereas multiherb products are formulae composed of
several single herbs. In Table 4, we analyze the HR of the
10 single- and multiherb products most commonly pre-
scribed. All were found to be statistically significant (P <
.001). The 3 single-herb products most commonly pre-
scribed were Salvia miltiorrhiza (Dan Shen), Astragalus
membranaceus (Huang Qi), and Spatholobus suberectus
(Ji Xue Teng). The 3 most commonly prescribed multiherb
products were Jia Wei Xiao Yao San, Gui Pi Tang, and Qi
Ju Di Huang Wan.
Discussion
Whether one is a proponent of CM or not, there is no ignor-
ing the fact that patients, including cancer patients, seek
these treatments when faced with health issues. A small
Canadian cohort study showed that among breast cancer
patients, the use of CM had doubled between 1998 and
2005.24 In Australia, 5% of these patients had sought CM,
whereas in Germany, a study from 2007 reported that
among 1030 patients with gynecological and breast malig-
nancies, 42% had used CM.25,26 One can only guess what
the statistics are among leukemia patients because no stud-
ies have been conducted. Nevertheless, the above data dem-
onstrate that although we should eventually strive for
evidence ranked high on the evidence-based medicine

pyramid, such as meta-analyses and randomized clinical tri-
als, we must in the meanwhile embrace any reliable data.
Our most significant finding was that the use of CHM
was associated with a significant decrease in HR. Patients
from the CHM group had a 49% lower HR than that of the
non-CHM group. Moreover, it was shown that patients
who took CHM for longer periods of time experienced a
more substantial decrease in HR. Certain influences, such
as motivation of patients, cannot be ruled out in this type
of retrospective study; however, this dose-dependence
supports the possibility of a causal relationship between
the two.
In the past, there have also been conflicting reports as to
whether or not the so-called lag time to treatment predicts
outcome in certain populations in AML.27,28 To test the pos-
sibility that decrease in HR was a result of this phenomenon
and not a result of dose dependence, we analyzed the
median lag time to treatment of each one of the subgroups
in Table 3. We found that all 3 groups commenced CHM
treatment roughly 7 months following AML diagnosis, and
this did not seem to be a significant factor.
There are different types of factors that may lead to
favorable or unfavorable outcomes in AML, most signifi-
cant of which are various molecular mutations. A recent
study performed in Taiwan showed that out of 378 AML
patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2008, 16.9% were
diagnosed with unfavorable chromosomal abnormalities,
and 13.2% presented positive ones.29 Yet one of the most
substantial prognostic factors, associated with poor survival
in AML, is the genetic mutation of Fms-like tyrosine kinase
3 (FLT3).30,31 Roughly 30% of AML patients are found to
possess mutated FLT3 and receive a target therapy named
sorafenib, which induces growth arrest and apoptosis of
cells fostering this mutation.32 However, cytogenetic abnor-
malities, such as the favorable t(8;21) or the unfavorable
11q23 and the FLT3 gene mutation mentioned above, all go
unregistered in the NHIRD, and we were, therefore, unable
to conclusively rule out the influence of these on our results.
We sought to address the lack of FTL3 status of patients in
the NHIRD and adjusted our data for the use of sorafenib.
Unfortunately, only in recent years has it become standard to
prescribe this drug to FLT3-positive patients in Taiwan, and

consequently, this attempt did not yield results. Despite the
lack of these data, we did manage to challenge the notion that
the improvement in HR of the CHM group was a result of sam-
pling bias. In many cases of high-risk or refractory AML,
patients opted for HSCT. HSCT patients accounted for roughly
10% of the cohort and were evenly distributed among the two
groups. Moreover, HSCT patients from the CHM group had a
38% lower HR compared with HSCT patients who did not
receive CHM (P = .04). This suggests that not only were high-
risk patients evenly distributed between the two groups, but
also that they might benefit from CHM treatment.
An additional important aspect of our results is shown in
Figure 4. Not only does the incidence of AML increase with
age, but the latter is also an important prognostic factor.33
One population-based study from Sweden stratified more
than 2700 AML patients according to 5-year age groups and
showed a near perfect correlation between this stratification
and survival time.34 In the Kaplan-Meier curve presented in
Figure 3, we performed a similar stratification according to
age and discovered that in this Taiwanese cohort, there was
also a strong correlation between age and survival time.
Correspondingly, there was a proportional improvement of
survival time for patients in the CHM group over the non-
CHM group. This finding once again challenges the notion
that improvement of HR was due to an uneven distribution

162 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(2)
of low-risk and high-risk patients among the two groups. It
is known that the incidence of AML with favorable cytoge-
netic abnormalities decreases with age.35,36 Following this
rationale, if improvement in HR was a result of favorable
prognostic factors, and not CHM, plot trends would have
appeared differently in Figure 4.
An investigation of the specific role played by the sin-
gle- and multiherb preparations presented in the results is
beyond the scope of this study. These were presented for 2
main reasons: (1) to summarize the collective experience of
Taiwanese CM physicians and provide other CHM practi-
tioners a reference point and (2) in hopes that future
research, whether it be basic or clinical, may use these find-
ings to assert a causal relation and therapeutic mechanism.
Conclusion
It is a reasonable assumption that a portion of AML patients
seek complementary forms of therapies following their
diagnosis. Although this study cannot replace a controlled
clinical trial or prove a causal relation, it strongly suggests
that adjunctive CHM therapy may benefit AML patients of
all ages, including those with poor prognosis. We are unable
to infer whether this is a direct result of the CHM consumed,
a synergistic effect with standard agents, or even just a
result of the former reducing the adverse effect of the latter
and consequently leading to more successful treatments.
We hope that this study may serve as a foundation for fur-
ther future research. The quality of life and safety outcomes
should also be included in future studies.
