Introduction
This article attempts to re-focus the discussion about partici-
patory communication by examining elements of an indige-
nous approach to research and practice. It is based on a larger
research project undertaken in Papua New Guinea (PNG),
Komuniti Tok Piksa (KTP), which sought to explore the use
of visual and creative methodologies in HIV prevention. The
research was guided by an indigenous (Melanesian) approach
and developed HIV prevention material by exploring and
capturing local narratives. This article focuses on one key
part of the project responding to the question on how local
narratives and indigenous knowledge can be incorporated
most significantly in researching and designing strategies for
social issues in a specific socio-cultural context.
KTP put emphasis on building relationships and entering
reciprocal spaces of exchange between researchers and
research participants. Approaches and frameworks were
negotiated, developed, and re-configured by the various
groups and communities involved. This moves the focus of
discussion to the relational accountability of the researcher
and his or her ability to negotiate a space where various lev-
els of participation emerge. Relational accountability
becomes thus an indicator for ethical research practice.
The results of the KTP project, some of which are the cre-
ative products of the groups such as films, were diverse and
polymorphous. As these products continue to be presented
to audiences, they open up and continue a dialogue among
community members and researchers and among communi-
ties themselves. The KTP project has been considered a suc-
cessful project by funders, communities, and wider audiences
due to the high identification level and community owner-
ship that was maintained throughout the creative production
process from conceptualization to production, postproduc-
tion, and distribution (Thomas et al., 2012).
The case study discussed in this article demonstrates the
use of an indigenous approach to visual research in develop-
ing communication for social change research strategies.
Although the study can be situated within the wider field of
health communication and approaches such as community-
based participatory research (CBPR; Blumenthal, 2011;
Rhodes et al., 2012), the focus of this article is on exploring
the way participatory action research (PAR) and visual
research interact within an indigenous research approach.
The active engagement of community members in becoming
active researchers on the project is assessed within the facili-
tation of media technologies that are being used as tools for
self-reflection and self-representation. Here the potential of

Relational Accountability in Indigenizing
Visual Research for Participatory
Communication

Abstract
This article argues that an indigenous approach to communication research allows us to re-think academic approaches of
engaging in and evaluating participatory communication research. It takes as its case study the Komuniti Tok Piksa project
undertaken in the Highlands of Papua New Guinea. The project explores ways in which visual methods when paired with
a community action approach embedded within an indigenous framework can be used to facilitate social change through
meaningful participation. It involves communities to narrate their experiences in regard to HIV and AIDS and assists them in
designing and recording their own messages. Local researchers are trained in using visual tools to facilitate this engagement
with the communities.

participatory research for community action emerges. Within
and through these media, the relationship between facilitator
and researcher and the various levels of "research data" that
emerge are captured allowing us to consider how local narra-
tives and indigenous knowledge can be incorporated in
researching and designing strategies for HIV prevention in a
specific socio-cultural context. By involving indigenous
ways of "seeing" and "doing" throughout the research pro-
cess, this article presents an innovative framework for under-
taking participatory communication research.
To contextualize the approach within the issues under
examination, the article first provides a brief background to
HIV and AIDS communication and presents the challenges
specific to PNG. The authors then illustrate the methodologi-
cal foundation for the study exploring aspects of visual
research and PAR before discussing the relevant components
of an indigenous research approach focusing on the concept
of relational accountability. The article argues that closer
attention must be paid to the relational space that is formed
between researchers and researched to create impactful pro-
grams and for researchers and project implementers to be
accountable for their actions while undertaking participatory
communication projects.
HIV and AIDS Communication
HIV andAIDS remains a complex social issue in which a vari-
ety of communication concepts have been explored over recent
years. Success stories in slowing down the spread of HIV and
AIDS demonstrate that locally and regionally specific commu-
nication approaches are required. Participatory communication
becomes important as it is recognized that communication
must move beyond awareness. As argued by Rico Lie (2008),
"awareness does not automatically lead to change" (p. 293).
This is supported more generally by Gumucio-Dagron (2003):
Information alone does not generate changes, whereas
communication--which implies participation, sharing of
knowledge in a horizontal way, and respect for diversity and
culture--is key to social change. (p. 3)
HIV and AIDS is a very personal and emotional issue.
Attitudes and behaviors are embedded in social and cultural
norms and are based on the situation of individuals.
Behavioral patterns do not necessarily follow rational deci-
sion-making processes and are therefore hard to guide and
impact (Airhihenbuwa & Obregon, 2000). These under-
standings are addressed in a recognized shift in HIV and
AIDS communication, which foregrounds the use of local
community media away from mass media campaigns, sees
HIV and AIDS as more than just a health issue, and moves
away from aiming at individual behavioral change to the idea
of social change (Lie, 2008).
In a country, such as PNG, this shift has began to
be addressed; however, specialized and highly contextual
approaches are required. Earlier programs which focused on
mass media campaigns might have been counter-productive,
reinforcing fear about HIV and hence increasing discrimina-
tion and stigma against those living with HIV (see King &
Lupiwa, 2009). Programs need not only deal with informing
people but also with reversing some of the misconception
that might have previously been created through more dis-
tant media approach.
The Challenges in PNG
According to the PNG National HIV and AIDS Strategy
2011-2015, the total number of people living with HIV was
estimated at 34,100 in 2009 (NACS, 2010). The trends of the
epidemic across regions of the country are not the same. In
2009, the majority of 90% of all new case reports of HIV
infections were from the capital Port Moresby and all the
Highland provinces (NAC, 2010) where this project has been
taking place. Despite an improvement in the knowledge of
patterns of the pandemic, NAC (2010) notes that there is still
a lack of epidemiological and behavioral data to steer the
national response, specifically in planning for prevention
initiatives.
The dynamics of HIV transmission in PNG are influenced by a
great diversity of sexual cultures, with different values, norms,
beliefs, and practices. The potential for sexual transmission of
HIV is heightened by early sexual partnerships, including
polygamy, extra marital sexual partnerships and inter-
generational sex; the exchange of sex for cash, goods and
services; low and inconsistent condom use; high levels of sexual
violence and rape; mobility; and the use of penile inserts and
modifications. (NAC, 2010, p. 19)
Awareness campaigns in the country have faced enormous
challenges due to these reasons: diversity in cultural and tra-
ditional beliefs and modernization being chief among them.
A medium that has shown some success comes through the
arts in theater and television drama. People are appreciating
edutainment (informative and entertaining), because it is
reaching a largely illiterate population who might not have
regular access to mass media (Corrigan, 2006). Furthermore,
if the focus is on socio-cultural change, the intervention has
to "focus on what is circulating within the social domain,
what is shared within the community . . . which will not
change any individual behaviour directly, but it will address
the climate [and] set a frame for discussion" (Lie, 2008,
p. 293).
Moving away from mass media campaigns, a couple of
initiatives sought to use the arts as a means of both awareness
and research, an innovating response to HIV. VSO Tokaut
AIDS Awareness Community Theatre Project is an action
research project that trialed community led theater in rural
communities (Corrigan, 2006; Levy, 2008). The visual
quality of theater defied language barriers as messages
were played out to reflect to communities, their realities.
Thomas et al. 3
Similarly, the approach of Community Conversations has
been adapted by the national AIDS Council. Dialogues are
facilitated within communities to identify the driving
forces of the epidemic, specific to local settings (Reid,
2010).
The success of these recent research and awareness initia-
tives has been in its localized approach, appropriation of
technology, and valuing of community experiences and
beliefs as a way of both facilitating the message creation and
creation of knowledge among participants. Such approaches
are reinforced in a literature review (King & Lupiwa, 2009)
which showed that cultural diversities, sensitivities, and fear
are delaying the success of the national response to HIV and
AIDS.
KTP: Developing New Approaches of
Working With Communities
KTP springs from the fundamental idea that sustainable
approaches to slowing the spread of HIV and AIDS need to
be developed by communities themselves to be successful.
This builds on strategies employed in CBPR and community
health advocacy work acknowledging the need for ethical
research and practice that prioritizes community ownership
and community empowerment (Blumenthal, 2011; Rasmus,
2014; Rhodes et al., 2012). Key to this approach for KTP was
the establishment of relationships between communities,
facilitators, and educators to develop sustainable communi-
cation channels where an ongoing dialogue is facilitated that
responds to the specific challenges a community faces. To
facilitate this process, KTP developed a creative research
approach that seeks to involve participants actively in the
creation of prevention messages that can be used to educate
others in PNG.
The KTP baseline study, conducted at the beginning of the
project in about 10 Highland communities, revealed a num-
ber of initial results (Thomas et al., 2012). "Standard" pre-
vention messages are often rejected, in particular those
explicit about sex or condoms. As a result of earlier mass
media interventions programs that were based on scaring the
population, people's perceptions with the disease are that of
death and as a disease with no cure. HIV is associated with
prostitution and unfaithful sexual behavior. These factors
have resulted in high stigmatization of those who are HIV
positive. In addition, a large number of people in the
Highlands have a lack of practical knowledge about the dis-
ease, how to prevent themselves from it, and how to look
after those who are HIV positive.
In regard to awareness, people commented on the lack of
involvement of those undertaking awareness in the local
communities, pointing at infrequent visits, and lack or lim-
ited engagement and length of stay resulting in forgetting the
message. In this, they demonstrated the missed opportunity
to build on trust with local community members.
Given this feedback, it is relevant to consider the indige-
nous social and cultural value systems as experienced day-
to-day in communities. PNG culture can be viewed within
the larger region of Melanesia as a region that shares cultural
commonalities, political alliances and, despite a large lin-
guistic diversity, a common language, Melanesian Tok Pisin.
Prominent in previous studies is that Melanesian culture is
strongly based on personal relationships, and these relation-
ships are key to any social change processes in the communi-
ties. The focal point of Melanesian societies is the community
or the clan/wantok. Wantok in Tok Pisin (Melanesian Pidgin)
means literally "One Talk," the ones who speak the same lan-
guage and, thus, share their same clan, tribe, and culture.
Loyalty to one's community often takes priority over indi-
vidual preferences. Through various relationships, the com-
munity provides a "safety net." People are taken care of, and
in turn, they have a series of obligations to the community
(Montovani, 1991).
KTP used the Melanesian understandings of relationships
in its research and community approach. Incorporating these
means grounding the approach in a Melanesian worldview
and Melanesian community experience (sharing a lived
experience). Research processes should focus on these expe-
riences, representing them in data collection and analysis.
Above all, research outcomes must be directed toward com-
munity benefit (Vallance, 2007). By putting a Melanesian
framework as central to our inquiry, we have to put at its
centre the community and relationships that emerge through
engaging in the research process. Careful attention needs to
be given to the way relationships are formed and the process
of exchange the researcher enters. Collaboration between
researcher, potentially co-researchers, and research partici-
pants becomes a necessary element. KTP researchers are
themselves local or have links to these communities through
their formal and informal networks (wantok system),
enabling, thus, their entry to the communities and facilitating
communication based on common background.
Knowledge must be understood in the context of relation-
ships formed to develop a holistic understanding--relation-
ships with people, ancestors, and the environment.
Knowledge of a community could be regarded as collective
memory (Thomas, 2011), common experiences that have
shaped the community in the past. Being aware of this col-
lective memory and incorporating it in research might help
build bridges between the community and researchers.
To facilitate the entry into communities by the KTP team,
it was important to enter with no direct agenda in mind and
being open to community (Bishop, 2005). The focus was
thus tuned into fulfilling a relational accountability to the
team and the community (Wilson, 2008) and giving the com-
munity a right to be understood (Husband, 1996). In
Melanesia, this means engaging in reciprocal relationships, a
give and take, between the community and the KTP team.
There must be an understanding and a will from the commu-
4 SAGE Open
nity that a project such as KTP can be beneficial to the com-
munity in some way (see Vallance, 2007).
Forming such a basis for the formation of meaningful
relationships is essential for HIV and AIDS communication
and has often been neglected. In most cases, outsiders decide
what information is displayed and what communication
channels are used. In PNG, however, there is a need to under-
stand what communication channels are most appropriate for
HIV and AIDS communication. Given the strong focus on
relationships and community well-being in PNG culture,
KTP sought to first create a space where these communica-
tion channels could be explored and opened up.
Visual Methods: Creating Spaces for
Reflection
The use of visual and creative methods with KTP can be cat-
egorized within "arts-based research" (Prosser & Loxley,
2008). Arts-based research methods emphasize the fact that
. . . people make sense of their lives through the interplay of
sensory relations not accessible through discourse; words and
numbers are mere proxies for their direct experiences. Textbased
approaches are limited because they fail to move beyond inherent
psychophysical characteristics to reveal taken-for-granted,
embodied, sensorial lives. (Prosser & Loxley, 2008, p. 35)
Given the linguistic diversity in PNG and a previous focus
on pamphlets and billboards as HIV and AIDS prevention
strategies, arts-based methods address emotional and embod-
ied elements of decision-making processes. Visual method-
ologies and arts-based inquiry, hence, focus on creating
dialogical engagement. Arts-based methods aim at creating
relationship and providing an "arena of exchange" for par-
ticipants (Bourriaud, 2002, p. 18). Visual experiences, in par-
ticular, form a key component in our daily lives. As
MacDougall (2006) argues, "visual knowledge provides one
of our primary means of comprehending the experience of
other people" (p. 5). Visual information stays in our memory
stronger than textual information does and images connect
strongly with our emotional experiences.
KTP uses a process that strengthens the idea of identifica-
tion and involves the screening back of material within the
community. The process of viewing one-self has been
described as empowering and raising self-confidence among
participants. "The act of seeing ourselves can join the links
of self-observation, establishing a clear identity that may
have been non-existent. Identity and self-definition are nec-
essary prerequisites for personal empowerment" (White,
2003, p. 66). In the process of seeing ourselves, we have the
opportunity to create a distant position to ourselves, reflect-
ing on our actions. For communities, the collective watching
of video material means the negotiation of shared meanings
and understandings. It creates an opportunity to discuss per-
ceptions within a group. This process becomes particularly
important within the context of HIV and AIDS which is sur-
rounded by taboos and stigmatization. Knowledge is put out
in the open, and through collective viewing, everyone is
brought on the same level for discussion.
The innovative research approach within the Highlands
context has provided researchers an opportunity to apply
local concepts and act them out through community partici-
pation. Using creative methods, as Knowles and Cole (2008)
have argued, is
part of a broader commitment to shift the dominant paradigmatic
view that keeps the academy and community separated: to
acknowledge the multiple dimensions that constitute and form
the human condition--physical, emotional, spiritual, social,
cultural--and the myriad ways of engaging in the world--oral,
literal, visual, embodied. (p. 60)
Arts-based research methods are closely linked to cultural
approaches to transformation and social change. Highland's
cultures are known for their capacity to express themselves cre-
atively. The setting thus provided a unique location to explore
engagement in creative research methods with communities.
Incorporating the visual approach with an understanding
of Melanesian values confirms Bourriaud's (2002) concept
of relational aesthetics that conceptualizes art practice away
from the "self-referentiality of modernist art," turning instead
to the way art-making builds relationships with others and
with the world. Bourriaud believes that collaborative art and
media making provide a space to explore these relations and
our identity as it evolves through them. Here, relations, not
media objects, are primary. A collective aesthetic means "our
values are embedded in our physical and affective relation-
ship with the world" (Leuthold, 1998, p. 16).
By facilitating a collaborative creative process, values
and decisions can be reflected on and collectively shared by
participants. This process as we indicate in this article pro-
vides an opportunity to tackle some of the driving forces of
the HIV epidemic and to ignite solutions developed by the
participants themselves specific to their local setting and
situation.
The KTP Process: Using PAR for Social
Change
The ethos behind participatory action research, involving
consultation and participation processes, is not for researchers to
adopt the responsibility of improving each individual's and
family's life. Instead, if individuals, families, communities and
institutions including governments are interested in improving,
or could be convinced to improve, then researchers and
practitioners can use participatory action research to facilitate,
support and assist the parties' own actions. (Kelman, Lewis,
Gaillard, & Mercer, 2011, p. 65)
The epistemological foundations of PAR, such as being con-
text-bound, focusing on real-life problems, seeking for
Thomas et al. 5
diversity and trans-disciplinarily (Bodorkos & Pataki, 2009),
resonated with the nature and aims of this project. And as
PAR's approach highlights, research subjects in this project
have been full participatory partners in the work of trying to
address the HIV/AIDS issue; the action to address this issue
arose from this collaborative work; and research was pro-
duced throughout this process (Wisner, Stea, & Kruks, 1991).
Action research starts "from an orientation of change with
others" rather than the change of others (Reason & Bradbury,
2008, p. 1). Participants, researchers, and community mem-
bers in this case engaged in processes of cyclic action from
observing, reflecting, planning, and action. The situational
characteristic of action research allows for the evaluation of
individual and community transformations, revealing how
knowledge is processed and constantly (re)formulated
within the discourse of culture (see Gegeo & Gegeo-
Watson, 2002). In this case, visual analysis and ethno-
graphic techniques have been used to engage community
members in interpreting interviews and behaviors.
Community interpretations were workshopped with local
researchers and participants through reflexive visual analy-
sis. Video ethnography is increasingly recognized as an
effective and accessible methodology, particularly in its
ability to create dialogical approaches to change (Iedema,
Long, Forsyth, & Lee, 2006).
The PAR cycle (observe-reflect-plan-act) was activated in
consultation with the participant community and other
members. Following initial observation, a baseline study,
and community reflection and discussion, a specific set of
actions was designed. This set of actions was then realized,
being iteratively reflected on and revised as the research pro-
gresses and as the community was given opportunities to
comment and respond. The main steps in the research pro-
cess included the eight stages mentioned in Table 1.
The engagement in visual and filmmaking processes
expanded the action research framework. Due to the large
amount of visual data collected, the research facilitators
underwent a selection process of the material that was then
incorporated in feedback sessions with the communities.
Reflection of the recorded material provided an additional
level of validation of the analysis of the data and served as a
trigger for dialogue among participants (Figure 1).
By using visual tools and looking back at them, research-
ers as well as community members entered a process of par-
ticipation, observation, filming, selection, reflection, and
positive change (see Iedema & Merrick, 2008). Through its
explorative nature, the project stayed open to adopting the
most effective and culturally appropriate processes. In a
country with strong oral traditions, linguistic diversity, and
high illiteracy rate, visual methods were tested and proved to
be appropriate in engaging communities in research and
community action practices. Through their potentially higher
level of engagement, research results are more likely to ben-
efit these communities.

No Stage Description
1 Consent and community
introduction
The local researchers first identified the community to conduct their research in. In
this case, the selection was influenced by an existing relationship of the leading local
researcher with this community through relatives which facilitated the entry into the
group. A community introductory meeting was then held with the community and
consent was gained from the community.
2 Baseline study Observation and interviews were conducted to assess the general level of HIV and
AIDS education and knowledge in the community, the way in which information is
disseminated, and the particular interests of the community.
3 Community profile and
communicative ecology
As part of creating a comprehensive profile of the community and its members, the
research teams created a profile of the community and facilitated the drawing of
their communicative ecology map which along with the baseline formed the basis of
knowledge and information dissemination patterns.
4 Review research topics and debrief Having iteratively revised the research topics to be inclusive of community perspectives
and needs, the researchers revised and planned the next stage. They incorporated
relevant community members, as the specifics of the research were finalized.
5 Recording or creation The research team, supervised by the principal researcher, recorded community
narratives or facilitated, where appropriate, creative workshops. For example, some
communities produced a film based on a dramatized story, and others created a song.
6 Downloading and editing The filmed data were then digitized and edited on-site, involving participants.
7 Screening or performing Once the product was prepared, the community was invited for a collective viewing.
The researchers together with the immediate participants then presented their artistic
creations to the community.
8 Reflection, collective viewing, and
discussion
Following the screening, the researchers facilitated community discussion focusing on the
issues raised by the visual outcome. Open discussion about HIV and AIDS relevant to
the community was stimulated.
6 SAGE Open
An Indigenous Approach to Visual
Research and Practice
In the first phase of KTP, researcher teams traveled to 10
Highlands communities to establish projects. The open
approach meant that in each community, the creative pro-
cesses varied. The level of participation was determined by
the communities, whether they contribute to the visual prod-
ucts by being interviewed or telling their own stories or
actively participating in taking pictures.
Prioritizing and Valuing Relationships
In trying to contribute to a growing body of understanding of
indigenous research approaches in PNG, the project sought
to open up a space where Papua New Guinean researchers
could examine their own understanding of what it meant to
do "indigenous research." This meant to reflect not only on
the community's practices and actions but also on their own
understandings and learning.
As I went through this research processes, I came to realise that
an indigenous approach was everyday in action, most times
unconsciously activated. The different approaches were helpful
in shaping my view of the KTP approach, making me link the
concepts to things I recognized in my life. Reading other
people's work however did not give me a sense of how I could
do my own research using an indigenous research approach.
(Eggins, reflections from her MA thesis on the project, 2011)
The indigenous research paradigm, especially from a
Melanesian research approach, accepts relationships as fun-
damental to the experience (Mel, 2002). The indigenous
researcher is also a stakeholder in the relationship web and
thus obliged to maintain it, taking the role of the researcher
to another level, this of a "critical, reflexive, stakeholder
researcher." The researcher's relationship to the community
needs to be clear and significant enough to make you a
stakeholder to the relationship, and it must be openly
acknowledged by members of the community:
Joys came here through a connection; you young people sitting
here know this. She came and slept in my house and worked
with the youths and you showed your film in other communities.
I am very happy about this. (Gigau, Closing comments, January
28, 2011, Ruti village)
Local researchers experienced several challenges in the pro-
cess of conceptualizing the project, their participation during
the process of entering the communities, establishing rela-
tionships in regard to this project, and defining their role as
facilitators, co-researchers, and members of the community.
In this process, they had to leave aside prior knowledge of
research methodologies that were not applicable within the
context of this research project.
The need for reflection on their personal experiences and
knowledge prior to this project and how they relate to their
role in the project was an important process for the local
researchers. An indigenous research approach is an encircle-
ment of ontology, epistemology, axiology, and methodology,
where individual cultural groups process and create knowl-
edge in everyday interactions (Gegeo & Gegeo-Watson,
2001; Vallance, 2007; Wilson, 2008). Each cultural group
has values that underpin its worldview, and the local research-
ers needed to develop an awareness of their worldview and
the impact it had on creating knowledge with the communi-
ties during the project process. Eggins developed her own
model in an effort to make sense what indigenous means in
the research process with communities (Figure 2).
In the above diagram, the outer circles represent everyday
community encounters, issues, events Eggins experienced.
These are all related, not compartmentalized, flowing one
into another in day-to-day activities. The inner circles repre-
sent community values, forming a foundation for ethical
conducts. The outer and inner circles are not exhaustive and
dependant on the community's activities and engagements.
At the centre is the community, and its well-being is achieved
through experiences, transitions, resolutions, and awareness
ofthingsbothnaturalandsupernatural(spiritual).Negotiation
was an important component of the research experience, and
knowledge of the community's values and expectations was
imperative. With the tensions, for instance, around project
benefits, it was important that the researcher continued to
negotiate through dialogue, reasserting the value of mone-
tary benefit as a sub-value compared with gutpela sindaun
(Tok Pisin for well-being) and its importance of maintaining
community relationships. Part of this ongoing negotiation
was her engagement in reciprocity, that is, sharing of food or
kill of a pig to say thank you.
Relational Accountability as Process and Ethics
Working with communities requires an ongoing negotiation
process of relationships including acquiring consent. Ignoring

relational conflicts or harmonies that exist in a community
would certainly have a direct impact on the researcher's rela-
tionship with the community. Relationships and accountabil-
ity to these relationships became an important part of the
negotiation process where transparency and openness were
key elements. Wilson (2008) affirms relational accountabil-
ity as a principle of researching indigenous communities. It
was paramount that the researcher maintained a good rela-
tionship with the community, for their family's, the partici-
pants', and the project's sake. Jones, Crengle, and McCreanor
(2006) note the importance of relationships in the Maori
research process.
A critical aspect of the research process has been
whakawhanaungatanga: allowing time and space to establish
relationships. The dynamics of whanaungatanga are critical in
determining participation in research and negotiating access to
communities. (Edwards et al., 2005, as cited in Jones et al.,
2006, p. 9)
This extends to what the authors say is an embodiment of the
new relationship (between researchers and researched)
beginning with "rituals of encounter, informed consent and
ability to opt out of the project and appropriate exit proce-
dures" (Jones et al., 2006, pp. 9-10). Some of the advocates
of indigenous research such as Bishop (1998) and Smith
(1999) write that research in indigenous communities using
Western epistemologies fail if its purpose is to improve con-
ditions of indigenous communities, instead of enabling the
communities to seek their own answers. Respecting relation-
ships and negotiating them around benefits that outweigh
monetary rewards encourages understanding and acceptance
of the project and its contribution to the community's well
being. A Melanesian epistemology is embedded in the rela-
tionships that are formed and from which knowledge of the
world is acquired.
In these communities, there was an intricate network of social
and family relationships that helped to ensure survival of the

group through interdependence and cooperation. People did not
define themselves in terms of their individuality, but in terms of
group affiliation. Basic to their thinking and knowing was
mutuality, not separateness. (Mel, 2002, p. 3)
Relationships are hard to measure and quantify, but everyday
expressions and ceremonial/symbolic gestures embodies the
relationships we have with one another. Negotiating these
relationships for the project included ongoing interactions
between participants and the researcher and communication
with them, about them as individuals and community mem-
bers and about the project. This enabled the researcher to talk
to participants about their uncertainties (i.e., money) and
plan for the future. The ongoing dialogue, including simple
acts of communication, such as wishing goodnight over the
phone, added value to the relationship. The youth partici-
pants of the Ruti village refer to Eggins as "sister" even after
the project's ending.
Negotiation with the wider community was through a
combination of occurrences. In Eggins's case, following the
initial screening in Ruti village, people began to understand
what the project was about. This became the focus of negoti-
ating the value of community's participation and the proj-
ect's continuity. As we dialogued after the screening, viewers
appreciated the visual, talking about its use as a tool for pre-
serving community images and traditional cultures.
On behalf of the community, I'd like to say thank you for doing
this. You came and got the youths involved in this drama film
and after watching it, we in this small community like it and we
are happy with you. (Viewer 6, Ruti screening, October 2010)
Wilson (2008) writes that an indigenous research paradigm
is when "the axiology and methodology are based upon
maintaining accountability to these relationships" (p. 71).
Mantovani (1984) describes it in a different way: referring to
relationships (in general) making a community connected to
each other in a web of interrelatedness, whether it be as
friends (positive relationships) or as enemies who pose a
threat to the literal sense of an end to life. Eggins's role as a
researcher/student/facilitator was clear to the participant
youths and community. But it was her connection to a family
(her aunt in this case) in Ruti that strengthened her position.
The community's knowledge of her family ties has made her
status a bit more than just researcher/student/facilitator. It is
a pre-set foundation that allows be to a firm stakeholder in
that relationship.
The relationships built on and forged are vital to the proj-
ect as well as the research process, where a space is created
for negotiation. The continued dialogue that she maintained
as a researcher kept the relationship going and the doors
open for collaborative work. It is this relationship that makes
Eggins a stakeholder in the experiences that unfold, thus
holding her accountable. The relationship thus transcends its
transactional character and enters a reciprocal long-lasting
phase where all parties are equally accountable.
The value of "community" is surface-value because com-
munity has always been the way Melanesian have experi-
enced a core value--being life translating to gutpela sindaun
in Melanesian Pidgin for lack of terminology translation
(Mantovani, 1984).
. . . the function of community is biological survival, emotional
survival, meaning, all the facets that are embodied in the word
"life." Life is not only biological existence; it is health, wealth,
well-being, good relationships, security, prestige, strength, etc.
The community has been experienced as the "only way to such"
"life," and so it comes to share in the "absoluteness" of "life."
(Mantovani, 1984, p. 201)
Mantovani (1984) offers that relationships, with ancestors,
within community, to other communities, to the total envi-
ronment, and exchange as pivotal to the interpretations of life
within community. In research endeavors, this might be
described as an embodiment of the new relationship (between
researchers and researched) beginning with "rituals of
encounter, informed consent and ability to opt out of the
project and appropriate exit procedures" (Jones et al., 2006,
pp. 9-10).
Engaging with the community in a meaningful way is
very important as all interactions have underlining meanings
that intricately connect everyone and everything in the
microcosm of these Highland's communities. In linking such
a research approach to issues like HIV and AIDS, and find-
ing ways of potentially making awareness effective, both
researcher and community must be collaborative agents of
change, understanding how a community in transition values
gutpela sindaun and especially how they interpret it. The
technology and all it entails can become a tool for opening a
space for communication for social change and participatory
communication.
When HIV/AIDS awareness groups come to the village they just
come and talk and go away and people do not get their message.
When KTP came into the community we thought that they were
here to do their research so we took them as another awareness
group. But now we see what they were here for and we were part
of the film that they made and it's very good for the community to
know more about HIV/AIDS . . . This film that we have made is
very good and it is powerful. The children can learn from it when
they grow up so I am very happy. (Older man, Mu Community in
the Simbu Province quoted in Thomas et al., 2012)
Refocusing the researcher's actions on his or her relational
accountability introduces a new perspective into the research
process. This approach also opens up a space for creative
collaboration. Once trust has been build in the community
and consent has been obtained for the participants to take part in
the research, a creative process begins. The building of the
Thomas et al. 9
relationships provides a space for creative collaboration.
Hence, certain groups within the participating communities
came forward with their ideas in regard to films, photogra-
phy, and music.
Creative collaborations bring in other aspects of this
approach such as relational aesthetics and how reflection,
feedback, and dialogue result in reciprocity that need to be
explored in their own merit. In regard to research in indige-
nous communities, there is a need to understand relational
accountability as foundational for any intervention under-
taken to ensure active participation of communities through-
out the process.
Conclusion
Previous HIV and AIDS prevention campaigns in PNG have
lacked an understanding of local narratives and processes. The
KTP project was designed to strengthen the level of commu-
nity ownership and identification in HIV prevention materials
to create a higher level of effectiveness of awareness cam-
paigns. To achieve this, KTP carefully reviewed and managed
researchers' relationships with community members. The
project employed concepts of an indigenous research approach
focusing on relational accountability and reciprocity to ensure
that the participation by communities was maintained. This
article has presented key points in that process by reviewing
the researchers'and community experiences. It has argued that
relational accountability should be carefully examined as a
key component in any community intervention.
Using visual approaches to research and community prac-
tice, in particular video, has presented itself as an appropriate
tool to exchange and communicate ideas and knowledge
about HIV and AIDS in PNG communities. Following indig-
enous principles can provide a more holistic approach to
communication, incorporating embedded cultural practices,
norms, and everyday negotiations into the identified issues in
regard to HIV and AIDS. The involvement of the community
members in the creation of such material was crucial in mak-
ing it relevant to their specific situation and in creating a
space for dialogue among others in the community.
Visual communication as a research tool can build on
existing community communication structures and serve as a
catalyst for sharing indigenous understandings. Communities
feel valued when their ideas are recorded. The open approach
to let the participants guide the creative process allowed the
researchers to better understand community perceptions
including scenarios of risky behavior. The viewing of the
Ruti film drama stimulated important community discussion
among audiences. The product therefore serves as a stimula-
tor within the local context.
Involving and training local researchers was a key com-
ponent of KTP's approach. Existing community relation-
ships were utilized and expanded throughout the project.
This was not without challenges, and ongoing negotiations
evolved around managing expectations from the communi-
ties, researchers, and funding bodies. Five years after the
project started, the audio-visual materials continue to be dis-
tributed in PNG and the wider Pacific, and the research team
continues to negotiate relationships with community mem-
bers who are involved in the distribution of the material.
The article has argued that for HIV/AIDS communication
to be successful, appropriate communication channels need to
be opened up. This begins with the way connections to mem-
bers of the community are established and how building trust-
ing-relationships with participants can provide access to local
narratives. This can be achieved by following indigenous
approaches to research and media practices prioritizing rela-
tional accountability of researchers and participants. Here, the
goal has been to mobilize the community to participate and
debate their views and for them to take ownership of HIV
messages and solutions to the HIV epidemic. Understanding
participatory communication from a relational perspective can
assist researchers to frame understandings of participation and
engages them in an ethical process reviewing their own
involvement with the community.
