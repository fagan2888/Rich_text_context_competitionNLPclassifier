Abstract
Objective: To identify the optimal sites for classification of early gout by ultrasonography.
Methods: Sixty patients with monosodium urate crystal-proven gout (25 with early gout [ 2-year
symptom duration], 35 with late gout [>2-year symptom duration], and 36 normouricemic healthy
controls) from one centre were prospectively evaluated. Standardized blinded ultrasound
examination of 36 joints and the triceps and patellar tendons was performed to identify tophi
and the double contour (DC) sign.
Results: Ultrasonographic sensitivity was lower in early than late gout. Binary logistic regression
analysis showed that two ultrasonographic signs (tophi in the first metatarsophalangeal joint [odds
ratio, 16.46] and the DC sign in the ankle [odds ratio, 25.18]) significantly contributed to the final
model for early gout diagnosis (sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 81%, respectively). The inter-
reader reliability kappa value for the DC sign and tophi was 0.712.
Conclusions: Four-joint investigation (both first metatarsophalangeal joints for tophi and both
ankles for the DC sign) is feasible and reliable and could be proposed as a screening test for early
ultrasonographic gout classification in daily practice.

Introduction
Gout is considered the most common form
of arthritis in adults, with a prevalence
ranging from 2.5% to 6.1% in the general
population.1­5 Gout has been recognized as
an independent risk factor for mortality and
morbidity.6 Early diagnosis, possibly even in
the asymptomatic hyperuricemic stage, is
needed to prevent poor outcomes. The gold
standard diagnostic technique for gout is
detection of monosodium urate (MSU)
crystals in synovial fluid.7­9 However, this
is an invasive procedure and does not allow
for evaluation of either the extent of urate
deposition or the response to urate-lowering
treatments. Ultrasonography (US) has
recently been proposed for these pur-
poses.10,11 The new American College of
Rheumatology/European League Against
Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) gout classifi-
cation criteria are the first to incorporate US
evidence of the double contour (DC) sign,
an articular cartilage abnormality related to
the deposition of crystals on the surface of
the hyaline cartilage, as a sign specific
to gout.12 The specificity and sensitivity of
other gout-related elementary US lesions,
such as the presence of tophi, still need to be
evaluated in prospective trials.12,13 The sen-
sitivity and negative predictive value of US
signs of MSU deposition in symptomatic
joints is only about 60%, while examination
of multiple joints gives better results.14
Naredo et al.15 proposed a 12-site US
examination including the upper and lower
extremities and two tendons; this technique
showed 84.6% sensitivity and 83.3% speci-
ficity for gout diagnosis. Peiteado et al.16
performed an uncontrolled study of a time-
saving 6-minute US examination of four
joints in the lower extremities (knees and
first metatarsophalangeals [MTPs]), which
allowed for the detection of ``hyperechoic
cloudy areas'' and/or the DC sign in 97% of
cases. Since the aforementioned studies,
most gout US imaging studies have
investigated patients with advanced-stage
gout17 with an average disease duration of
7 years. Therefore, which and how many
sites should be investigated for optimal US
gout classification in patients with early-
stage gout remains unclear.
Our goal was to compare the diagnostic
value of US in early- versus late-stage gout
and to establish an optimal multiple-site US
test for early gout classification.
Methods
The prospective case-control single-
centre study was performed from 2013 to
2016. The study was approved by the
Lithuanian University of Health Sciences
Kaunas Region Biomedical Research
Ethics Committee. Written informed con-
tent was obtained from all patients before
study entry.
Participants
For inclusion in the study, participants had
to be >18 years old and meet one of the
following two criteria: (1) have a diagnosis
of gout as stated by a rheumatologist and
confirmed by the study investigators accord-
ing to the presence of MSU crystals in a
symptomatic (ever) joint or bursa and have
no acute gout attack at the time of US
examination, or (2) have a healthy clinical
status with a serum uric acid (UA) concen-
tration of 404 mmol/L (6.8 mg/dL) without
objective or subjective joint symptoms.
Patients with gout were recruited from
those who had been referred from a primary
care facility for a rheumatology consult-
ation. Patients with other inflammatory
diseases or psoriasis were excluded. The
participants were divided into four groups
for statistical analysis: whole gout (all
patients with gout), early gout ( 2 years
from the first attack), late gout (>2 years
from the first attack), and healthy controls.

Sample size calculation
The primary effect variable used for the
power calculation was the proportion of
tophi or DC signs found per joint site on US
examination. With an assumption of a
calculated expected sensitivity of 49% for
tophi or the DC sign in patients with
advanced gout, 23% in patients with early
gout, and 2% in healthy controls; based on
the sensitivity reported at different joint sites
in previous studies15,18­20; and aiming for a
power of 0.80 and a risk of 0.05 for type 1
errors, a minimum of 49 joints was required
per site for comparison between patients
with early and late gout, and a minimum of
29 joints was required for comparison
between patients with gout and healthy
controls. Because bilateral assessment of
each site was planned, a minimum of 25
participants was required in each group.
Clinical and laboratory assessment
All participants underwent a clinical assess-
ment and blood sampling by a rheumatolo-
gist. Demographic data (age and sex), height,
weight, and the serum concentrations of UA,
C-reactive protein, and creatinine were
obtained for all participants. Disease history
(symptom duration and the numbers of gout
attacks throughout life and within the last
year) and the presence of subcutaneous tophi
were recorded for all patients with gout.
US assessment
Standardized US examinations were per-
formed for all participants by one rheuma-
tologist (M.P.) who had 10 years of
experience in musculoskeletal US and was
blinded to the patient groups and clinical
data. The LOGIQ e US system with a
12-MHz linear transducer on a B-mode
scale was used for all US examinations.
Obtained views were recorded to the digital
file for each participant. Thirty-six joints
(both wrists, metacarpophalangeals [MCPs],
hand proximal interphalangeals, knees,
ankles, and MTPs and four tendons [both
triceps and patellar tendons]) of each partici-
pant were assessed. All joints were scanned in
the longitudinal plane on the dorsal side.
Knees were explored in the longitudinal and
transverse planes in the suprapatellar and
parapatellar joint recesses on full extension of
the leg for joint cavity evaluation, longitu-
dinally at 20 degrees of flexion for patellar
tendon evaluation, and transversally at max-
imal flexion for femoral cartilage evaluation.
The ankles were investigated in the longitu-
dinal plane on the dorsal and lateral sides.
These views were chosen according to the
guidelines for musculoskeletal US.21­23 The
areas scanned were defined based on typical
gout clinics and previously published litera-
ture.15,24,25 Joints were investigated for the
presence of the DC sign and tophi. Tendons
were investigated for tophi. US features of
MSU crystal deposition (Figure 1) were
chosen based on the literature15,21,26­29 and
personal experience. Specifically, an intra-
articular tophus was defined as a circum-
scribed heterogeneous, hyperechoic/isoechoic
(relative to subdermal fat) mass, sometimes
with hypoechoic inclusions and with or
without a small anechoic rim. The DC sign
was defined as a hyperechoic band over the
superficial margin of the articular hyaline
cartilage, visible independent of the angle of
insonation. An intratendinous tophus was
defined as a circumscribed heterogeneous,
hyperechoic/isoechoic (relative to the tendon
fibres) aggregation with poorly defined mar-
gins and with or without areas of acoustic
shadowing, changing the normal course of
the tendon fibres.
US reliability
Prior to the study, two investigators (M.P.
and E.N.) scanned 10 patients with gout
Norkuviene et al. 1419
(not included in the study) who had visible
subcutaneous tophi to discuss the scanning
technique, clarify previously reported defin-
itions of gout lesions, and identify typical
signs of gout deposits. To calculate the
reliability and reproducibility of the US
assessment, a Web-based exercise was per-
formed at the start of the study. Eighty-four
digitally recorded US images with or with-
out urate deposits in different investigated
areas of both patients and controls were
randomly selected from the database and
evaluated twice at a 3-week interval for the
presence or absence of MSU deposits by
two rheumatologists: M.P. (the investigator
who obtained the US images) and E.N.
(4 years of experience in US and special
skills in gout US). Both rheumatologists
were blinded to the patients' clinical data.
The results reported by investigator M.P.
or upon agreement were used for statistical
analysis.
Synovial fluid investigation
US-guided aspiration from symptomatic
(ever) joints or bursas was performed by the
two above-mentioned study investigators
(M.P. and E.N.) in all patients with gout
before inclusion in the study. Healthy con-
trols underwent aspiration when they had
pathological US findings (tophus or DC sign)
and if they agreed to undergo an interven-
tion. Synovial fluid was analysed for MSU
crystals by polarized light microscopy on the
same day as the aspiration. Analysis was
performed by two trained rheumatologists.
One of them was an independent assessor
who was blinded to the patients' clinical data
and US results. Discrepancies between esti-
mators were resolved by consensus.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using
SPSS statistical software, version 20.0

Continuous variables are presented as as
mean Æ standard deviation or median, and
categorical variables are presented as fre-
quency and percentage. The frequencies of
US findings were calculated first as propor-
tions (displayed by participants) and second
at individual investigated sites. Paired means
between groups were compared using the
Mann­Whitney test or Student's t test and
Pearson's chi-square test or Fisher's test for
categorical variables, as appropriate. All
tests were two-tailed. The reliability analysis
was performed using unweighted Cohen's k-
statistic for dichotomous assessment (i.e.,
presence or absence), and the k-statistic was
interpreted as follows: 0.00­0.20, slight reli-
ability; 0.21­0.40, fair reliability; 0.41­0.60,
moderate reliability; 0.61­0.80, substantial
reliability; and >0.80, almost perfect reli-
ability.30 To identify the most important
sites and signs for US gout classification,
only variables with a p-value of <0.05 in the
chi-square test and a Cramer's V of >0.3
were subjected to binary logistic regression
with the forward stepwise conditional
method. The diagnostic value of the devel-
oped set of US features for US gout classi-
fication was estimated using a classification
table: sensitivity of prediction (percentage of
patients classified correctly) and specificity
of prediction (percentage of controls classi-
fied correctly). All p-values of <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The data of 96 participants were chosen for
analysis: 60 patients (53 men) with primary
gout proven by the presence of crystals
(25 classified as early gout, 35 as late gout)
and 36 healthy controls (28 men). Seventeen
patients clinically suspected to have gout
were screened for the study, but gout was
not confirmed by crystal microscopy and
the patients were not analysed. The demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of
the study participants are displayed in
Table 1. There were no differences in sex
or age between the two groups. The median
disease duration in the whole gout group
was 3 (0, 1­33) years. A total of 35%
(21/60) of the patients with gout were
undergoing treatment with hypouricemic
agents, but only 13% (8/60) had a serum
UA concentration of <360 mmol/L. Tophi
were clinically identified in 40% (24/60) of
the patients with gout. Patients in the early
and late gout subgroups were similar in
terms of the UA concentration, C-reactive
protein concentration, glomerular filtration
rate, diuretic use, and body mass index;
however, patients with early gout had
fewer gout attacks during the last year/
throughout life and had no tophi compared
with patients in the late gout group
(all p < 0.0001).
US gout lesions: Frequencies and
comparison between groups
In total, 2160 joints and 240 tendons of the
patients with gout were evaluated and
compared with 1296 joints and 144 tendons
of the healthy controls. The investigated US
signs in patients and controls, expressed
as the number and percentage of affected
anatomical sites, are shown in Figure 2.
Comparisons of the tophus and DC sign
frequencies in the investigated anatomical
areas between the early and late gout sub-
groups are shown in Figure 3; tophi and DC
signs were less often found in all investigated
areas in the early than late gout subgroup
on US examination. The frequencies
of tophi and DC signs, expressed as the
number and percentage of participants with
affected anatomical regions between
patients and controls, are displayed in
Table 2; a tophus and DC sign in one or
more joint areas (36 investigated joints) were
found more often in the patients than con-
trols, with a sensitivity of 85% and 87% and
specificity of 83% and 86%, respectively

Optimal set of US lesions for gout
classification
The parameters entered into the binary
logistic regression model were wrist tophus,
second MTP tophus, triceps tendon tophus,
second MCP DC sign, knee DC sign, first
MTP tophus, ankle DC sign, first MTP DC
sign, and second MTP DC sign (all with
Cramer's V of >0.3) (Table 2). The pre-
dictors that contributed to the model and
were therefore considered to be independ-
ently associated with US gout classification
using the whole gout group and controls
were a tophus in the first MTP joint (odds
ratio [OR], 20.21; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 4.42­92.31; p < 0.0001), a tophus in the
triceps tendon (OR, 8.80; 95% CI, 0.96­
80.65; p ¼ 0.054), the DC sign in the ankle
(OR, 30.01; 95% CI, 2.42­372.92; p ¼
0.008), the DC sign in the first MTP joint
(OR, 11.11; 95% CI, 0.95­130.55; p ¼ 0.055),
and the DC sign in the second MTP joint
(OR, 27.06; 95% CI, 2.02­361.84; p ¼ 0.013),
with a sensitivity and specificity of predic-
tion of 93% and 78%, respectively. When
the same parameters were entered into
a binary logistic regression analysis, only
two signs contributed to the model in the
early gout subgroup: a tophus in the first
MTP joint (OR, 16.46; 95% CI, 4.04­
67.13; p < 0.0001) and the DC sign in the
ankle (OR, 25.18; 95% CI, 2.30­276.35;
p ¼ 0.008), with a sensitivity and specificity
of 84% and 81%, respectively (Table 3).
Inclusion of the upper extremity joints, patel-
lar tendons, and knee joints in the regression
model did not improve the model at any
stage of the disease. Using Pearson's chi-
square test, we also checked the sensitivity
and specificity of two tests for US gout
classification proposed in the literature15,16
using our whole gout cohort and the early
and late gout subgroups (Table 4). The
sensitivity and specificity of all tests
(including those created with the regression
analysis (Table 3) and those proposed in
the literature (Table 4)) were similar, with
Table 3. Parameters associated with ultrasonographic gout classification* on binary
logistic regression, tested in the whole gout group and early gout subgroup.

Intra- and inter-reader agreement ()
of US findings
The k value for inter-reader agreement for
cartilage was 0.671 and that for tophus was
0.773; the mean k value for inter-reader
agreement was 0.712. The intra-reader
(M.P.) agreement for cartilage was 0.657
and that for tophus was 0.770; the mean k
value was 0.740. The intra-reader (E.N.)
agreement for cartilage was 0.727 and that
for tophus was 0.828; the mean k value was
0.809. The strength of agreement was con-
sidered good or very good.
Concordance between US findings and
microscopic evaluation of MSU crystals
Forty-five intra-articular tophi found by US
examination (39 randomly selected from
patients with gout and 6 from healthy
controls) were aspirated. MSU crystals
were microscopically identified in 80% of
participants (36/45). Six crystal-negative
samples were from the healthy control
group, and three were from the clinically
suspected gout group (all from the first MTP
joint). Thirty-six tophi found in the first
MTP joint on US examination were con-
firmed by MSU crystal identification in 75%
of participants. Aspiration of these tophi in
patients with gout revealed MSU crystals in
90% (27/30) of patients. In five joints with
only the DC sign present on US examin-
ation, crystals were found in 80% of cases
(one crystal-negative sample was from the
healthy control group). The combination of
a tophus plus the DC sign on US examin-
ation showed 100% concordance (12/12)
with MSU crystal identification.
Discussion
To meet the study goals, only patients with
gold standard-proven gout (confirmed by
MSU crystal detection in synovial fluid) and
who fulfilled the recent 2015 ACR-EULAR
diagnostic criteria for gout12 were included
in the study and compared with healthy
controls. The median duration of the gout
symptoms in our whole cohort was 3 years,
and 40% of the patients with gout had
subcutaneous tophi. This is characteristic
for a typical gout population but differs
from most previous studies15,16,18,19,31 that
reported the value of US in patients
with advanced tophaceous gout. We separ-
ately analysed 25 patients with early
(median disease duration, 0.83 years)

non-tophaceous gout; this group of patients
could serve as a representative example of
the gout population in primary care, for
which information about the value of US is
still missing.
Previous US studies have demonstrated
that the presence of tophi and the DC sign
have high sensitivity and specificity in late
gout.18,19,31 The largest and most well-
controlled US multicentre observational
cross-sectional study was recently per-
formed by Ogdie et al.32 That study included
824 participants (416 patients with gout and
408 controls) in whom a single swollen joint
was investigated. The authors found that the
sensitivity for tophus, ``snowstorm,'' and the
DC sign on US was only 46.0%, 30.3%, and
60.1% and that the specificity was 94.9%,
90.9%, and 91.4%, respectively. In patients
with a gout symptom duration of <2 years,
sensitivity was limited (tophus, 34%; snow-
storm, 32%; and DC sign, 51%). That study
did not evaluate the sensitivity and specifi-
city of multi-site investigation in the early
stage. Comparison of the results of their
study and ours is difficult because of the
different descriptions used for specific gout
lesions and the different anatomical sites
investigated. Our understanding of
``tophus'' and ``DC sign'' is in line with the
definitions proposed by the Outcome
Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT)
group13 except that we did not differentiate
``tophus'' from ``aggregates,'' and some of
our ``tophi'' could be considered ``aggre-
gates'' according to the OMERACT cri-
teria. The feasibility of the latter definition is
doubtful because the latest efforts of the
OMERACT US group to validate the def-
initions of US gout lesions in patients
showed poor interobserver agreement for
``aggregates.''13 The double-validity control
performed in our study exhibited good value
for specific US signs of MSU deposition:
83% specificity for tophi and 86% specificity
for the DC sign according to healthy
normouricemic controls, and 80%
concordance of US tophi and the DC sign
according to synovial fluid investigation for
MSU crystals.
To check the spread and specificity of US
signs of MSU deposition in different disease
stages, we systemically scanned 36 joints
(including the upper and lower extremities)
and two tendons (patellar and triceps) in the
present study. We found a tophus and/or
the DC sign in at least one investigated
area (40 sites) in 97% of patients with gout,
which is comparable with the findings
reported in previous studies.16,17,24 The
joints most often affected in the lower
extremities, similarly reported in other stu-
dies,16,18,25 included the first MTP joints,
knees, and ankles. We identified fewer DC
signs in the first MTPs; the DC sign was
found in 35% of the joints in our whole gout
group compared with 64% to 67% in pre-
vious reports.18,25 This last finding can
be explained by the shorter duration of
symptoms in our whole cohort. Because we
investigated only the suprapatellar and
parapatellar recesses (without the lateral
and medial compartments) of the knee,
we reported many fewer intra-articular
knee tophi than did the authors of some
studies16,18,31 but an amount very similar to
that reported in the suprapatellar knee
recesses in one study.15 Our study confirms
the findings reported by Naredo et al.15, who
stated that the wrists and second MCP joints
are the most often affected joints in the
upper extremities.
Our direct comparison of the urate
deposit load (tophi or the DC sign) between
patients with a disease duration of <2 versus
>2 years, even with our relatively small
number of participants, showed that urate
deposition was significantly lower in the
earlier stage of the disease in all sites
(including the upper and lower extremities
and both investigated tendons). Tophi and
the DC sign were seldom or not found in the
MCP or proximal interphalangeals in
patients with early gout. Our examination
1426 Journal of International Medical Research 45(4)
findings for small hand joints are compar-
able with those of Ottaviani et al.,18 who
found no tophi or DC signs in MCP joints in
early gout.20 The most specific signs found
in the present study included tophi and the
DC sign in the knees, ankles, and foot joints,
showing up to 97% specificity for healthy
controls. We found that the presence of a
tophus in the first MTPs was the most
sensitive US sign for gout in all stages,
although it was less specific (83%) with the
blinded assessment performed in our study
than in some previous studies reporting
100% specificity for tophi in toes with a
nonblinded investigator. False-positive
tophi on US could be explained by degen-
erative changes in a toe, which are found in
17% of healthy persons, and confirmed by
the absence of crystals in synovial fluid
in our study.
To create an optimal US test for early
diagnosis of gout, we first performed
binary logistic regression analysis for all
patients with gout. The US predictors that
contributed to the regression model and
were therefore estimated to be independ-
ently associated with gout were tophi in
the first MTP joint, tophi in the triceps
tendon, the DC sign in the ankle, the DC
sign in the first MTP, and the DC sign in
the second MTP joint cartilage; these signs
had a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and
78%, respectively. Parameters such as the
DC sign in the knee, tophi in the wrist, and
tophi in the patella did not improve the
diagnostic model for US gout classifica-
tion. While testing the same predictors for
early gout classification (excluding patients
with a disease duration of >2 years), we
found that only two US signs--tophi in the
MTP joint and the DC sign in the
ankle--were independently associated with
gout in the final step of the regression
analysis, with a sensitivity of 84% and
specificity of 81%. This finding suggests
that the first MTP joint and ankle might be
the joints most often involved in gout at
the beginning of the disease. Both tests,
including the one recommended for US
gout classification in the literature15,16 and
the one tested in our cohort, showed good
value and were comparable in terms of
sensitivity and specificity in patients with a
disease duration of >2 years. The sensitiv-
ity of all diagnostic tests, including the
``12-sites'' US examination,16 the 4-joint
(knees and first MTPs) investigation,15 and
the set of 5 joints, generated from the
results of our study was lower (80% versus
94%, 76% versus 94%, and 88% versus
100%, respectively) in patients with a
disease duration of 2 than >2 years.
The best balance between the sensitivity
(84%) and specificity (81%) of early gout
diagnosis was reached with investigation of
the first MTPs for tophi and the ankles for
the DC sign in our study.
Several limitations of our study should be
mentioned. Twenty-one of 60 patients with
gout (35%) were reportedly undergoing
hypouricemic therapy, which might have
had an impact on US sensitivity;31,33 how-
ever, most were not within the therapeutic
window (87% of the patients had a UA
concentration of >360 mmol/L), and there
was no difference in the use of hypouricemic
treatment between the early and late gout
subgroups. For ethical reasons, all US
assessments (long-lasting US assessment of
40 sites) were performed by a single inves-
tigator; however, validity control showed
good concordance between the US findings
and crystal detection in the synovial fluid as
well as between the two investigators in the
Web-based exercise. The lack of a univer-
sally accepted definition of tophus during
the planning phase of the study might have
resulted in overestimation of the percentages
of tophi found per participant because some
of them might now be defined as aggre-
gates.13 Finally, exclusion of the lateral and
medial knee compartments from the exam-
ination protocol in our study could have
impacted the final test results.

This study is the first attempt to compare
the spread of specific US gout symptoms in
early versus late gout using a multiple-site
investigation. Our findings create a para-
digm for future US studies, suggesting that
the MSU deposition load increases propor-
tionally with the disease duration at all
anatomical sites, demonstrating the highest
sensitivity in the first MTP joint and ankle
in the early stage of the disease. The value
of the diagnostic test for early gout proposed
in our study should be assessed using
the most recent definition of tophus13 and
in asymptomatic patients in the hyperurice-
mic stage.
Conclusions
The present study has shown that the US
sensitivity for specific US signs of MSU
deposition (tophus and the DC sign) was
lower in patients with a gout symptom
duration of 2 than >2 years.
The four-joint investigation, which
includes both first MTPs for tophi and both
ankles for the DC sign, is feasible and reliable
and could be proposed as a screening test for
early US classification of gout in daily prac-
tice based on the results of our study.
