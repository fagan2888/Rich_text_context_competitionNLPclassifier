Abstract
Objectives
To validate trajectories of late-life mobility change using a novel approach designed to over-
come the constraints of modest sample size and few follow-up time points.
Methods
Using clinical reasoning and distribution-based methodology, we identified trajectories of
mobility change (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument) across 2 years in 391 partici-
pants age !65 years from a prospective cohort study designed to identify modifiable impair-
ments predictive of mobility in late-life. We validated our approach using model fit indices
and comparing baseline mobility-related factors between trajectories.
Results
Model fit indices confirmed that the optimal number of trajectories were between 4 and 6.
Mobility-related factors varied across trajectories with the most unfavorable values in poor
mobility trajectories and the most favorable in high mobility trajectories. These factors
included leg strength, trunk extension endurance, knee flexion range of motion, limb veloc-
ity, physical performance measures, and the number and prevalence of medical conditions
including osteoarthritis and back pain.
Conclusions
Our findings support the validity of this approach and may facilitate the investigation of a
broader scope of research questions within aging populations of varied sizes and traits.

Introduction
Older adults tend to experience change in mobility and disability with great variation due to
comorbidity and high rates of illness and injury. [1, 2] Longitudinal analyses examining dis-
ability progression have accounted for this variation by using multiple trajectories. [2­4] Often
these analyses use advanced statistical techniques, such as latent class growth analysis or mix-
ture modeling to identify distinct groups of individuals that follow similar patterns of change
over time. However, this statistical methodology requires large sample sizes and several time
points to ensure model convergence, validity, and sufficient statistical power. [5­7] Alternative
methods that overcome these constraints would facilitate trajectory research among a wider
variety of study designs and populations.
Most studies investigating disability trajectories in late-life have focused on activities of
daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), [2­4, 8, 9] and few have
examined trajectories of mobility change. Mobility limitations, which conceptually precede
disability within models of disablement, are typically the target of rehabilitative intervention.
Limitations in mobility are common among older adults, affecting approximately one quarter
of adults aged 70 years and older and half of those aged 80 years and older. [10] Mobility limi-
tations pose a significant threat to the health and independence of older adults, leading to poor
outcomes such as falling, hospitalization, nursing home admission and mortality. [11­17] The
Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE), was designed to investi-
gate key research questions identified by experts in geriatric rehabilitation, such as identifying
underlying predictors of poor and declining mobility. [18] Thus, mobility trajectories repre-
sent a major outcome for Boston RISE.
While advanced statistical techniques used to model trajectories require adequate sample
size and sufficient time points, the values for these requirements are not completely rigid and
depend on additional factors such model complexity and the amount of variance explained by
the model. [7] Nevertheless, there are certain generally accepted guidelines. For example, three
or more follow-up time points are typically required, although two time points may be ade-
quate in the case of partially missing data for some participants. [7, 19] In addition, a sample
size of at least 100 participants is generally preferred for growth curve modeling; however the
adequacy of this number is also dependent on the number of observations per individual, and
therefore more participants may be needed when fewer follow-up time points are available. [7]
This study aimed to identify distinct trajectories of mobility change using 3 time points
over 2 years of follow-up within 430 older adult primary care patients. To overcome the con-
straints of modest sample size and minimal follow-up time points, we generated trajectories of
mobility change using a novel approach that incorporated both clinical reasoning and distribu-
tion-based methodology. We demonstrated the validity of our approach using latent class
growth analysis and by comparing differences across trajectories in baseline mobility-related
health conditions, body functions/impairments, personal factors, and physical function/activi-
ties consistent with the World Health Organization's International Classification of Function-
ing, Disability, and Health and Nagi disablement models. [20­22] We hypothesized that that
these factors, particularly body functions/impairments and physical function/activities, would
differ across trajectories with more deficits observed for unfavorable mobility trajectories.
Methods
The Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE) is a prospective
cohort study designed to identify modifiable impairments that are associated with mobility in
older adults. Study methods have been previously detailed. [23] Briefly, primary care patients
aged !65 years were recruited from 9 practices across the greater Boston area from December

2009 to January 2012. Patients who met preliminary inclusion criteria within the practices
were randomly selected for inclusion on a master recruitment list. The master list was divided
into subgroups based on age, sex, and race, and oversampling was used to ensure that the
cohort was representative of the older adult population residing within a 10 mile radius of the
healthcare facility. Eligibility included difficulty or task modification with walking one-half
mile and/or climbing 1 flight of stairs. [16] Exclusions included moderate or severe dementia
(Mini-Mental State Examination score <18), and severe mobility limitation (Short Physical
Performance Battery [SPPB] score <4). [24, 25] All methods were approved by the Spaulding
Rehabilitation Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval number 2008P002472) and writ-
ten consent was obtained from all participants. Baseline assessments were completed by 430
participants. This analysis included 391 participants (n = 8 died, n = 8 withdrew due to illness,
n = 23 withdrew or were lost to follow-up) with mobility measured at baseline and either or
both annual assessment in the two year follow-up period (n = 46 had outcome at year 1 but
not year 2; n = 1 had outcome at year 2 but not year 1).
LLFDI Lower-Extremity Function
The Lower-Extremity Function component of the patient-reported Late Life Function and
Disability Instrument (LLFDI) is a widely used, validated measure of mobility [26] that
assesses functional limitations applicable to daily life [27] consistent with both the Interna-
tional Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health [20] and Nagi disablement [22]
models. The LLFDI contains two lower-extremity scales: 1) Basic Lower-Extremity Function
(BLE)­tasks involving standing, stooping, and basic walking; and 2) Advanced Lower-Extrem-
ity Function (ALE)­involving higher levels of physical ability and endurance, such as walking
several blocks or standing up from the floor. Higher scores represent better mobility. We have
previously shown that a change of 4.4 in BLE and 6.3 in ALE reflect the minimal detectable
change with 90% confidence (MDC90
). [28]
Baseline Characteristics
This analysis included various baseline characteristics from several of the domains within the
disablement models. Personal factors included age, sex, race, and education. Cognition was
measured using the widely-used and validated Mini-Mental State Examination. [29, 30] Over-
weight and obesity status were defined using body mass index categories. Sensory loss was
measured using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. A 4.17 monofilament (providing a
standardized force of 1.4g) was applied to the dorsum of the right toe until the thread buckled.
If the participant could not feel the 4.17 monofilament during at least 3 out of 4 trials, a 5.07
monofilament (providing a standardized 10g force) was applied. Inability to feel both the 4.17
and the 5.07 monofilament during 3 out of 4 trials was considered evidence of sensory loss.
[31] Several neuromuscular impairments that were associated with baseline mobility were
included. [32] Strength was measured on a pneumatic leg press machine using a previously
published protocol. [23] Strength asymmetry was calculated by dividing the higher value side
by the lower value. Leg velocity was calculated by dividing peak leg press power by peak force.
[33] Knee flexion and ankle range of motion (ROM) were measured using a goniometer. [34]
Trunk extensor muscle endurance was measured with the participant lying prone on a special-
ized plinth positioned 45° from vertical using a previously published protocol. [35] Because
some participants were unable to complete some of the neuromuscular tests (up to 14%),
weighted multiple imputation was performed on these data. [36] The Activities-Specific Bal-
ance Confidence Scale is a valid and reliable measure of confidence in performing 16 daily
activities without losing balance or becoming unsteady. [37, 38] Scores ranged from 0­100

with higher scores indicating higher confidence. The SPPB measured standing balance, usual
paced walking speed, and 5-repetition chair stand time. Scores ranged from 0­12 with higher
scores indicating better performance. Usual gait speed (m/s) was measured over 4 meters. A
validated co-morbidity index measured the presence of 13 common chronic conditions. [39]
Prevalence of the following individual conditions was also included: heart disease, hyperten-
sion, lung disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, osteoarthritis, back pain, neurologic disease,
and peripheral arterial disease. Participants were asked if they had ever been told by a doctor
or health professional that they had the disease.
Statistical Analysis
Recent studies investigating disability among large cohorts of older adults have identified 5
distinct trajectories of change. [2, 3] Based on this literature and clinical reasoning, we gener-
ated a five level categorical variable to define persistent states and meaningful change in mobil-
ity for each the BLE and ALE scales of the LLFDI across baseline, year 1, and year 2. The five
categories included: persistently poor, decline, persistently intermediate, improvement, and
persistently high. "Decline" and "improvement" were defined as a decrease and increase,
respectively, !MDC90
between any two time points. If both decline and improvement
occurred, the amount of change from the first time point to the last was used as the tie breaker.
When no meaningful change occurred, "persistently poor" and "persistently high" were
defined as scores at the final follow-up (year 2 or 1) within the lowest or highest quartiles,
respectively. "Persistently intermediate" was defined as scores at the last follow-up between the
highest and lowest quartiles.
To validate the number of trajectories for both LLFDI scales, we performed latent class
growth analysis, and estimated the log Bayes factor using the Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) score with the following equation: 2 x [(BICgreater trajectories model
)­(BICfewer trajectories
model
)]; where a positive score indicates an increase in fit for the model with the greater num-
ber of trajectories and a negative score indicates a decrease in fit. [19, 40] This score is used for
nested models, and is thus appropriate for testing the inclusion of different numbers of trajec-
tories within a model. Guidelines for interpreting the extent of evidence provided by the log
Bayes factor for model complexity while accounting for model parsimony are as follows:
0­2 = weak evidence; 2­6 = moderate evidence, 6­10 = strong evidence, and >10 = very strong
evidence. [40] We additionally used model convergence to judge fit.
We evaluated known-groups validity among the trajectories by testing differences in base-
line characteristics through three sets of pairwise comparisons: comparisons between the per-
sistently poor and each of the other trajectories, comparisons between the persistently high
and each of the other trajectories, and comparisons between the improvement and decline tra-
jectories. Chi-squared, t-tests, and non-parametric equivalents were used with an alpha level of
0.01, since multiple comparisons were performed. We also performed two separate sensitivity
analyses in which we adjusted comparisons for age and sex and tested the differences in neuro-
muscular impairments between the trajectories using non-imputed data.
Results
When validating the number of trajectories generated for ALE mobility, we found positive log
Bayes factor scores indicating an increase in fit for the models with the greater number of tra-
jectories for 4 vs. 3 (log Bayes factor = 95.2) and 5 vs. 4 trajectories (log Bayes factor = 31.6),
although the model with 5 trajectories did not converge. For BLE mobility, positive log Bayes
factor scores indicated an increase in fit for the models with the greater number of trajectories
for 4 vs. 3 (log Bayes factor = 32.5), 5 vs. 4 (log Bayes factor = 36.4), 6 vs. 5 (log Bayes

factor = 41.2), and 7 vs. 6 trajectories (log Bayes factor = 11.3), although the model with 7 tra-
jectories did not converge.
Mean LLFDI scores for each trajectory at each time point are presented in Fig 1. Table 1
shows that participants with persistently poor ALE mobility were more likely to have a high
school education, and less likely to have had graduate/professional schooling than those in the
improvement and high mobility trajectories, although the latter were marginally significant
(p<0.05). Participants with persistently high ALE mobility had the fewest chronic conditions,
best knee flexion ROM and SPPB scores (Table 2), and a lower rate of back pain than those
with persistently intermediate and persistently poor mobility (43.8% vs. 67.0% and 76.9%,
respectively; p<0.01 for both). The persistently poor BLE trajectory had lower cognition scores
(Table 3), the slowest limb velocity, poorest knee and ankle flexion ROM, the most chronic
conditions (Table 4), and higher rates of lung problems, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and back pain

A Novel Approach to Identifying Trajectories of Mobility Change in Older Adults
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0169003 December 22, 2016 7 / 12
Discussion
Findings from this study demonstrate the feasibility and validity of a novel approach for identi-
fying mobility trajectories within a modest sized cohort over 2 years. This approach extends
the use of trajectory analyses to studies with smaller sample sizes and fewer follow-up time
points than previously allowed by traditional statistical approaches. Such findings have the
potential to promote the investigation of a broader scope of research questions involving tra-
jectory analyses within aging populations of varied sizes and traits.
Model fit indices showed very strong evidence (log Bayes factor >10) that the optimal num-
ber of trajectories fell between 4 and 6, suggesting our selection of 5 trajectories was appropri-
ate. This number of trajectories is also consistent with the number reported in previous studies
of disability among large cohorts of older adults. [2, 3] Although we used a clinically intuitive
approach, we observed similar patterns of mobility change to those previously described using
advanced statistical techniques. For example, the decline trajectory described in this analysis,
is conceptually similar to "progressive", "developing", [2] or "accelerated increase" [3] in dis-
ability trajectories from other studies. However, less often included is an "improvement" or
"recovery" trajectory, [41] despite high rates of recovery from disability reported in older
adults. [42] We found that 25% and 17% of our cohort experienced meaningful improvement
in BLE and ALE mobility, respectively. It is possible that we were able to detect improvement
in mobility while others were not due to responsiveness of the LLFDI to improvement, dem-
onstrated previously within this study population. [28] Categorizing individuals with improve-
ment in mobility is particularly important for research informing interventions since it
supports that improvement of mobility is achievable for older adults.
Overall, we found that participants in the persistently poor mobility trajectories had the
least favorable mobility-related baseline characteristics, while participants in the persistently
high mobility trajectories had the most favorable characteristics. This included a number of
personal, health-related, body function/impairment, and physical function/activity factors.
The improvement and decline in mobility trajectories had more favorable characteristics than
the poor mobility trajectories and less favorable characteristics than the high mobility trajecto-
ries; however, the characteristics of the improvement and decline trajectories did not differ

from each other. This may be evidence of contributing factors to change in mobility that were
not included in this analysis, such as healthcare leading to improvement in mobility or medical
complications leading to decline.
This is the first study to identify mobility trajectories using the LLFDI, a widely used, vali-
dated measure of mobility, specifically designed to be responsive to change. [26] We previously
showed within this cohort, that the LLFDI detected meaningful decline and improvement
comparably to performance-based measures such as the SPPB and gait speed. [28] This analy-
sis extends these results by showing that the LLFDI is able to capture a number of different tra-
jectories of meaningful mobility change over a relatively short time period of 2 years.
Limitations
Although targeted recruitment within this study resulted in demographic distributions consis-
tent with the 2004 census for older adults living within the recruitment area, [32] our findings
may not be fully generalizable to older adults within other geographical regions. Some partici-
pants were unable to perform some neuromuscular tests resulting in missing data; to address
this we performed multiple weighted imputation on these data. [36] Persistently poor and high
mobility trajectories had modest numbers of participants, which may have resulted in low
power for some comparisons. Despite this, we found numerous significant differences when
comparing these trajectories to others. We only assessed baseline predictors of mobility and
the duration of our follow-up was relatively short; however, this may mirror annual wellness
visits in which a clinician must target risk factors for mobility decline assessed within a single
initial evaluation. Future work should examine the predictive ability of these different trajecto-
ries on key health-related outcomes. Further validation of this approach may be warranted
using additional instruments.
Conclusion
Using a novel approach designed to overcome constraints of modest sample size and few fol-
low-up time points, we identified five trajectories of mobility change within this study of older
adults. We demonstrated the validity of this approach by using latent class growth analysis to
confirm the optimal number of trajectories and by comparing known mobility-related charac-
teristics between the trajectories. This approach has the potential to extend trajectory analysis
to a wider variety of studies and populations.
