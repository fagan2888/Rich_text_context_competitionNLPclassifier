Abstract
Objective: To assess self-reported health status (SRHS) in two cohorts of participants with radiographic knee osteoarthritis
(OA) and examine the extent that differences in SRHS are due to study design.
Method: We used data from the Third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES-III; population-based
national survey) and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI; prospective cohort study). Inclusion criteria for this analysis were age
60­79 and presence of radiographic knee OA. SRHS, elicited as a five-item domain (excellent, very good, good, fair, poor),
was analyzed by dichotomizing the general health status measure as ``fair/poor'' versus all other states. We estimated the
proportion of participants in fair/poor health from each study. Propensity score methodology was used to adjust for the
differences in sampling strategies between the two studies.
Results: Thirty-four percent (N = 1,608) of OAI and 29% (N = 756) of NHANES-III participants satisfied inclusion criteria. The
proportion in fair/poor health was higher in NHANES-III (28%) than in OAI (5%). After adjusting for the propensity score, the
proportion in fair/poor health was four times higher in NHANES-III than in OAI.
Conclusion: SRHS was substantially better in OAI than in NHANES-III. Self-selection bias may contribute to overestimation of
SRHS in prospective cohort studies such as OAI.

Introduction
Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and disabling disease
that primarily affects the elderly. Among US adults age 60 or
older, knee OA is one of the five leading causes of disability [1]
and approximately 12­16% have symptomatic knee OA [2,3].
Studies have shown that knee OA greatly diminishes health status
in the elderly [4,5].
Self-reported health status (SRHS) is a subjective measure of how
one perceives and reports his or her own well-being. SRHS is often
measured by asking individuals to rate their health as excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor. This type of self-reported information is
considered an important indicator of a person's health status [6]. It
has been shown to be a stable measure of one's health and to be
associated with the number of physician contacts [7] and mortality
[7,8]. Often SRHS is measured in national surveys to monitor
population health and this measure has been used in the United
States [8], Canada [6], England [9], and Australia [10].
SRHS in persons with radiographic knee OA could be studied
in national population-based studies, such as the Third National
Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES-III), or
large longitudinal prospective cohort studies, such as the
Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). Each study design has its own
distinct advantages and disadvantages. An advantage of well-
designed population-based studies is that they exhibit good
internal and external validity [11]. However, most of these studies
are cross-sectional in nature, which makes it challenging to
evaluate how SRHS changes over time [12]. An advantage of
cohort studies is that most are longitudinal so they are able to
evaluate how SRHS changes over time. However, these studies
usually rely on volunteer study subjects that may be healthier than
the general population rendering the studies vulnerable to
selection bias [13]. Selection bias in turn limits the extent that
study results can be generalized to the general population.
Propensity score methodology has been used to account for
selection bias in non-randomized studies [14­17]. This analytic
approach assigns each subject a propensity score, defined as the
probability of the subject receiving one of the treatments under
consideration, as opposed to the other. The propensity score
permits investigators to adjust for selection bias due to measured
factors, but it still cannot account for selection bias that is due to
unobserved factors [18].

Our objective was to report the SRHS from two studies focused
on knee OA. We sought to examine the differences in SRHS, and
factors explaining these differences, between the two studies. As a
methodological aim, we also sought to assess the differences in
SRHS due to study design and to evaluate how much of these
differences can be remedied by using propensity score methodol-
ogy. Evaluation of SRHS in these two cohorts will demonstrate the
differences in SRHS between a nationally representative sample
(NHANES-III) and a volunteer cohort (the OAI). These
differences have implications both for interpreting OAI data per
se and more generally for the use of volunteer cohorts to
understand population level effects.
Methods
Ethics statement
The Brigham and Women's Hospital institutional review board
approved the study. Since all data is available freely on the web
and all data analyses were secondary, we did not obtain written
informed consent from the subjects.
Data sources
NHANES-III. NHANES-III is a national population-based
survey that was conducted from 1988­1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics of the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. The survey was conducted in two phases. Phase I took
place from 1988­1991 and Phase II from 1991­1994. NHANES-
III survey data were collected during a face-to-face interview. All
participants were then asked to schedule an appointment at a
medical examination center where additional data would be
collected. Additional details about patient recruitment and
selection for the NHANES-III survey has been documented [19].
Radiographs were performed during Phase II for all NHANES-
III participants who were 60 years of age or older and could
transport themselves to the radiograph table under their own
power. The radiographs were performed using a non-weight
bearing anteroposterior approach according to NHANES-III
protocol [20]. To be included in this analysis, participants had
to be between the ages of 60 and 79 with evidence of radiographic
knee OA.
OAI. OAI is an on-going multi-center, longitudinal,
prospective cohort study. Participants were eligible for the study
if they were between 45 and 79 years old at entry. Participants
were excluded if they had rheumatoid or any inflammatory
arthritis, were unlikely to show measurable joint space narrowing,
had total knee replacement (TKR) in both knees or planned to
have TKR in both knees in the next 3 years, were unable to
undergo an MRI, had a positive pregnancy test, were unable to
provide a blood sample, used ambulatory aids other than a straight
cane, had comorbid conditions that would prevent them from
participating in a four-year study, were unlikely to reside in the
clinic area for at least three years, were participating in a double-
blind randomized control trial at the time, or were unwilling
to sign the informed consent. Socio-demographic and clinical
data were collected via a computer-based self-administered
questionnaire. The radiographs were performed using a pos-
teroanterior fixed-flexion weight-bearing approach according to
OAI protocol. For our analysis we further restricted the OAI
sample to those between the ages of 60 and 79 and had evidence of
radiographic knee OA at their baseline visit.
Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from
the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, which is available for
public access at http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/. Specific datasets used
are version 2.1 of ``Enrollees00'', ``JointSx00'', ``MedHist00'',
``PhysExam00'', ``SubjectChar00'', and ``Biomarkers00''. Addi-
tional documentation describing various aspects of the design and
methods of the OAI is available on the OAI Online website
(http://www.oai.ucsf.edu/).
Differences in study design characteristics are defined in detail
in Table 1.
Defining knee OA: Radiographic assessment
Knee radiographs were assessed by trained radiologists in both
NHANES-III and OAI. In NHANES-III, K-L grades were
computed by the radiologist. In OAI, osteophyte and joint space
narrowing scores were computed for each knee by trained
radiologists based on OARSI Atlas grades. From these scores we
then computed K-L grades for each knee based on the algorithm
provided on the OAI website [21]. For our analysis we used the
greater of the right and left K-L grades, and we defined
radiographic knee OA in the tibiofemoral joint as having a K-L
grade of at least 2.
Outcome: Self-reported health status
SRHS was elicited in both NHANES-III and OAI by asking the
participant to rate their overall health as excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor. As has been done in previous studies, SRHS
was analyzed as a dichotomous variable (excellent, very good, or
good versus fair or poor) [4,22­25].
Potential correlates of self-reported health status
ascertained in both studies
Sociodemographic characteristics. We hypothesized that
age, gender, race, and income are possible correlates or
confounders of SRHS. NHANES-III and OAI had different
age criteria to be included in their studies although there was
significant overlap. NHANES-III performed knee radiographs on
participants age 60 and older, while OAI included participants
between the ages of 45 and 79. To best take advantage of these
age criteria, we included participants who were between the ages
of 60 and 79. Age was classified into four categories; 60­64, 65­
69, 70­74, and 75­79. We classified participants in both studies
as being of white or nonwhite race. We inflated participant's
income in NHANES-III from 1994 dollars to 2004 dollars using
the CPI conversion index calculator provided by the US Bureau
of Labor Statistics website so that a participant's income in
NHANES-III would be comparable to a participant's income
from OAI [26]. We then classified income into five categories;
,$20,000, $20,000­$34,999, $35,000­$49,999, $$50,000, and
missing.
Comorbidity. We identified several closed-ended questions
concerning the presence of medical problems at the time of the
survey or in the past in both studies. A comorbidity index was
computed by counting the total number of self-reported medical
problems. These included asthma, chronic bronchitis or
emphysema, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction,
stroke, diabetes, cancer (including skin cancer), fractures of the
hip or spine, gout, and back pain most days for at least one month.
We then dichotomized the total number of comorbidities as those
having 0-1 comorbidities versus 2 or more. Obesity status was
considered as a separate factor with obesity defined as body mass
index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 [27].
Knee Pain. We defined NHANES-III participants as having
knee pain if they answered `Yes' to having knee pain for most days
for six weeks or more. OAI participants were considered as having
knee pain if they answered `Yes' to having knee pain most days for
the past 30 days.

Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical features of the two samples are
compared using percentages and are displayed in Table 1. We
calculated the proportion of participants in fair/poor health along
with 95% confidence intervals for both cohorts stratified by the
previously described correlates. To account for the over-sampling
of minorities in NHANES-III, we applied the appropriate
sampling weights for this unadjusted analysis. There were no
sampling design features that require the use of sampling weights
in the analyses involving OAI participants.
To evaluate the effect of study design on SRHS we conducted
five analyses. The first analysis compared SRHS between the two
cohorts without adjusting for any other factors using the whole
sample. The second analysis compared SRHS between the cohorts
by adjusting for the covariates we have previously mentioned using
the whole sample. Analyses three through five involve constructing
a propensity score model, which estimates the probability of being
in the NHANES-III cohort as opposed to the OAI cohort [14].
This was done by performing multivariable logistic regression with
study (NHANES-III or OAI) as the dichotomous outcome and
age, gender, race, obesity status, comorbidity, K-L grade, knee
pain, and income as covariates. Since the propensity score model
is evaluating the probability of being selected into NHANES-III
given a set of covariate values, we did not apply sample weights to
this model. To evaluate the performance of our propensity score
model we first trimmed the sample to those with propensity scores
between 0.2 and 0.8 because that is the region where there was
substantial overlap between the two groups (Figure 1). We
evaluated how well the propensity score model was able to
balance the covariate distributions between the cohorts by
regressing the interaction between cohort status and quintile of
the propensity score on each covariate using generalized logistic
regression. Statistically significant interactions indicate that given
the quintile of the propensity score, the cohorts differ for that
particular covariate [14]. In analysis three we compared SRHS
between the two cohorts without adjusting for any factors in those
who had a propensity score between 0.2 and 0.8 (i.e. those
included in the trimmed sample). In analysis four we used
multivariable logistic regression to analyze the difference in SRHS
between the cohorts while adjusting for covariates in the trimmed
sample. In analysis five we used multivariable logistic regression to
analyze the difference in SRHS between the cohorts while
adjusting for the propensity score in the trimmed sample.
In our models that adjusted for the propensity score or for other
covariates we created dummy variables for missing race, obesity
status, and income to minimize the number of observations that
needed to be removed for missing data.

(93.3%) had a K-L grade on at least one knee. Of these
2,412 participants, 756 (31.3%) had radiographic knee OA
(K-L 2+) and were between the ages of 60 and 79. The OAI
cohort consists of 4,796 participants, 4,491 (93.6%) of whom
have a K-L grade on at least one knee. Of these, 1,608 (35.8%)
had radiographic knee OA and were between the ages of 60
and 79.
The participants in NHANES-III and OAI differed in many
respects. NHANES-III participants were likely to have more
comorbidities (25% with 2+ comorbidities versus 8% in OAI).
OAI participants were more likely to have more severe disease and
knee pain than NHANES-III participants. Twenty-four percent of
OAI participants had a K-L grade of 4 and 46% had knee pain. In
NHANES-III, 6% were K-L 4 and 34% had knee pain.
Distributions of age, gender, race, obesity, and income were
similar between the two cohorts (Table 2).
Self-reported health status (SRHS)
The prevalence of being in fair/poor health for participants in
NHANES-III was 28.3% (95% CI: 23.5, 33.2), while the
prevalence of being in fair/poor health for OAI participants was
substantially lower (5.2% [95% CI: 4.1, 6.3]). NHANES-III
participants maintained a substantially higher prevalence of being
in fair/poor health across all subgroups. Participants who were of
nonwhite race, had more comorbidities, and reported lower
incomes were more likely to be in fair/poor health regardless of
the cohort. Additionally, OAI participants who were more obese
and reported having knee pain were more likely to be in fair/poor
health. In NHANES-III, the proportion in fair/poor health
increased with increasing obesity status but the 95% confidence
intervals overlapped (Table 3).
Multivariable analysis and propensity score adjustment
The distribution of propensity scores, where the propensity
score is defined as the probability of being selected into the
NHANES-III cohort, stratified by cohort is shown in Figure 1.
The distribution of propensity scores in OAI is right skewed and
concentrated in the 0.0 to 0.2 range, while the distribution is fairly
uniform across all values in NHANES-III, indicating substantial
differences in populations participating in each study. Within the
trimmed sample (defined as a propensity score between 0.2 and
0.8), the propensity score was able to balance the distribution of all
the covariates by cohort status with the exception of knee pain (p
for interaction = 0.01).
Figure 2 depicts the proportion of participants in fair/poor
health stratified by cohort for our five different analyses. When
adjusting for all covariates using the whole sample (N = 2,357) the
percentage of participants in fair/poor health was 4.4% in OAI
and 23.4% in NHANES-III. Trimming the sample (N = 961)
based on the propensity score did not substantially account for any
of the differences in SRHS regardless of the analysis undertaken.
The proportion of participants in fair/poor health in the trimmed
sample ranged from 25% to 30% for NHANES-III participants as
opposed to 5% to 7% for OAI participants.
Discussion
We compared SRHS in a national population-based sample
(NHANES-III) and a large prospective cohort (OAI) in persons
with radiographic knee OA. We analyzed SRHS as a dichotomous
outcome using the general health status question. We found that
the SRHS in OAI was substantially better (lower prevalence of
being fair/poor health) than in NHANES-III. We also found that

these differences were not sensitive to any of our adjustment
procedures, which included covariate adjustment, and propensity
score adjustment with trimming of the sample. In NHANES-III,
the prevalence of being in fair/poor health was at least 18% higher
regardless of the adjustment procedure.
The implication of this finding is that study design and sampling
procedures affect estimates of SRHS. In particular, prospective
cohort studies that try to ensure complete follow-up may exclude
participants that report a lower health status. Evaluating SRHS in
these cohorts may underestimate true population levels and may
lead to insufficient power to determine the differences among
subgroups since between group differences may be attenuated.
This especially holds true for assessing absolute differences and
may hold true for assessing relative differences if there is not
sufficient variability in the outcome and exposure [11]. In OAI the
variability in SRHS is reduced making it difficult to observe
clinically and/or statistically significant differences in SRHS
between different groups.

Similar to our study, previous estimates of SRHS also appear to
be dependent on the study design. A statewide study conducted by
Dominick et al. using Pennsylvania's Pharmaceutical Assistance
Contract for the Elderly in 1997 found that 55% of OA patients
were in fair/poor health, which is much higher than NHANES-
III. The mean age of the cohort was 80 years and the mean
Charlson Comorbidity Index was 2 [4]. Another statewide study
conducted in Missouri by Andresen et al. in 1999 of participants
with a mean age of 40 found a 20% prevalence of being in fair/
poor health [25]. The Beaver Dam Health Outcomes Study is a
community study of participants between the age of 45 and 89.
Approximately 12% of participants reported being in fair/poor
health, which is higher than the estimate from OAI, but 82% of
the participants reported at least one comorbid condition.
Differences in SRHS between OAI and NHANES-III may be
due to the two mechanisms of participation. The first mechanism
is the exclusion of subjects in OAI. OAI had many more
exclusions, which may have precluded the enrollment of
participants who have a lower SRHS. The second mechanism is
refusal to participate among those who are eligible. Data on
participation rates are not made readily available so we can not
objectively assess the differences in participation between the two
studies. However, the longitudinal nature of the OAI study may be
perceived as especially burdensome by eligible participants,
especially those in poorer health.
As any analysis utilizing observational studies, our analysis was
subject to limitations of such a design. In particular, we were
unable to adjust or account for the differences in SRHS observed
between the two cohorts that may be due to unmeasured variables.
We developed several propensity score models before settling on
the one reported in this paper. The propensity score presented in
the paper allowed us to maximize the balance covariates between
the two studies. Some residual lack of balance across two cohorts
with respect to knee pain suggests there is an underlying
unmeasured variable or mechanism that may account for some
of these differences. These variables could be unmeasured in one
or both studies. Another limitation is that the radiographs in
NHANES-III and OAI were not performed using the same
protocol. NHANES-III used a non-weight bearing approach,
while OAI used a more accepted weight bearing method. Because
non-weight bearing radiographs were used in NHANES-III,
radiographic severity may have been underestimated [28]. While
this would affect estimates of SRHS within NHANES-III, it is
doubtful that the misclassification of radiographic severity would
account for the large discrepancy between the two study
populations.
OAI collected SRHS and other data via a computer-based self-
administered questionnaire, while NHANES-III collected their
data via face-to-face interview. While the impact of survey
modality on responses has been well documented when studying
topics of sensitive nature, such as HIV [29], the topic has not been
rigorously studies when evaluating SRHS. One study found that
those responding via a self-administered questionnaire were more
likely to report decrements in health-related quality of life [30].
However, in our analysis those responding via a self-administered
questionnaire (those in OAI) reported a higher SRHS.

Lastly, SRHS was assessed about 10 years earlier in NHANES-
III than in OAI. While it is possible that the time difference could
account for the difference it in SRHS, it is unlikely. Hayes et al.
conducted analysis of NHANES data collected from 2001-2004
and found that 17% were in fair/poor health [23]. While this is in
the middle of the estimates found in NHANES-III and OAI, 78%
of the sample was below the age of 60. It is likely that if this
analysis was restricted to persons over the age of 60 that the
prevalence of being in fair/poor health would increase because of
the increase in comorbidity.
We found that SRHS in a national sample of persons with
radiographic knee OA was substantially worse than those in a
sample from a prospective cohort study conducted in four centers,
regardless of the adjustment procedure performed. Since SRHS is
an outcome of great interest in persons with knee OA, it is
important to note the effect that study design has on this subjective
outcome. Strict selection criteria in prospective cohort studies to
ensure complete follow-up may make it difficult to study SRHS
and how it changes over time because the participants are more
likely to have a high SRHS and maintain it over the course of the
study. Future studies of SRHS in these cohorts should take into
account these possible limitations of their sample.
