The authors conducted a cross-sectional study of the association of serum selenium with the prevalence of
peripheral arterial disease among 2,062 US men and women 40 years of age or older participating in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2003­2004. Serum selenium was measured by using inductively cou-
pled plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. Peripheral arterial disease was defined as an ankle-
brachial blood pressure index <0.90. The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalence of peripheral arterial disease
decreased with increasing serum selenium (P for linear trend ¼ 0.02), but there was an indication of an upturn in
risk in the highest quartile of serum selenium. The fully adjusted odds ratios for peripheral arterial disease com-
paring selenium quartiles 2, 3, and 4 with the lowest quartile were 0.75 (95% confidence interval: 0.37, 1.52), 0.58
(95% confidence interval: 0.28, 1.19), and 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.34, 1.31), respectively. In spline
regression models, peripheral arterial disease prevalence decreased with increasing serum selenium levels up
to 150­160 ng/mL, followed by a gradual increase at higher selenium levels. The association between serum
selenium levels and the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease was not statistically significant, although
a U-shaped relation was suggested.

Selenium, an essential micronutrient involved in anti-
oxidant selenoenzymes such as glutathione peroxidases,
has been hypothesized to prevent atherosclerotic disease
(1­3). Glutathione peroxidase synthesis and activity,
however, plateau at selenium levels above 70­90 ng/mL
(4). In the United States compared with other countries,
selenium intake is substantially higher (5), and most
adults have serum selenium levels above 95 ng/mL (4).
At these high concentrations, selenium is incorporated
nonspecifically as selenomethionine in the synthesis of
other plasma proteins, with unknown health effects (4).
It is thus unclear whether increased selenium levels con-
fer additional benefit for atherosclerosis prevention in the
United States.
A recent meta-analysis of 14 prospective cohort studies
found a modest, but statistically significant inverse associa-
tion between selenium levels and coronary heart disease (3),
but the 2 US studies in this meta-analysis found no associ-
ation (3, 6, 7). Moreover, serum selenium levels were not
associated with cardiovascular disease mortality in a pro-
spective study in a representative US sample, although
a U-shaped relation was suggested (8). Given the current
interest in selenium supplements for chemoprevention of
cancer (5), it is important to understand the overall impact
of increased selenium intake on other health endpoints, in-
cluding vascular disease.
Peripheral arterial disease, which affects about 8 million
Americans, is characterized by flow-limiting atherosclerosis

in the muscular arteries of the lower extremities and is an
important marker of generalized atherosclerosis (9­11).
Data on the association of selenium levels with peripheral
arterial disease are very limited (12, 13). The objective of
the present study was to assess the association between
serum levels of selenium and reduced ankle-brachial
blood pressure index (ABI), a specific subclinical marker
for peripheral arterial disease, in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2003­2004. ABI
values below 0.90 are considered diagnostic of peripheral
arterial disease. Furthermore, a low ABI is an independent
predictor of cardiovascular risk after adjusting for traditional
cardiovascular risk factors (14, 15).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
NHANES is conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics (Hyattsville, Maryland) by using a com-
plex multistage sampling design to obtain a representative
sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US popula-
tion. We used data from NHANES 2003­2004 (16) be-
cause it was the first NHANES survey to measure
selenium and ABI levels simultaneously. In NHANES
2003­2004 interviews and physical examinations, the
overall response rate was 76%. Serum selenium and
ABI measurements were restricted to participants aged
40 years or older (N ¼ 3,086). We excluded 2 pregnant
women, 183 participants without selenium measure-
ments, 514 participants without ABI measurements in
both legs, and 314 participants with missing information
on any adjustment covariate. We finally excluded 11 par-
ticipants with left or right ABI measurements of more
than 1.5, usually due to vessel stiffness. The final sample
size was 2,062. The 2003­2004 NHANES study protocols
were approved by the National Center for Health Statis-
tics institutional review board. Oral and written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
Serum selenium
Collection materials were screened for potential selenium
contamination. After blood collection, serum aliquots were
obtained, frozen at À20°C, and shipped to the Trace Ele-
ments Laboratory at the Wadsworth Center of the New York
State Department of Health for analysis. Serum selenium
levels were measured by using inductively coupled
plasma-dynamic reaction cell-mass spectrometry. The lab-
oratory procedures and quality control methods for serum
selenium measurement have been described in detail else-
where (17). The between-assay coefficients of variation for
quality-control pooled samples analyzed throughout the du-
ration of the survey ranged from 2.5% to 2.9%.
Peripheral arterial disease
A specific protocol was used to measure ABI in
NHANES 2003­2004 (18). The measurements of blood
pressure used for ABI were additional to and different from
other measurements of blood pressure used to evaluate hy-
pertension. Systolic blood pressure was measured on the
right arm (brachial artery) and both ankles (posterior tibial
arteries) with a Doppler device, the Parks Mini-Lab IV, model
3100 (Parks Medical Electronics, Inc., Aloha, Oregon). If the
participant had a condition that would interfere with blood
pressure reading in the right arm, the left arm was used.
Systolic blood pressure was measured twice at each site for
participants aged 40­59 years and once at each site for
participants aged 60 years or older. The left and right
ABI measurements were obtained by dividing the mean
systolic blood pressure in each ankle by the mean systolic
blood pressure in the arm. Peripheral arterial disease was
defined as an ABI value of less than 0.90 in at least one leg
(14, 15).
Other variables
Information about age, sex, race-ethnicity, education,
family income, menopausal status for women, cigarette
smoking, alcohol consumption, use of dietary supplements,
and use of cholesterol- and blood-pressure-lowering medi-
cations was based on self-report. Body mass index was cal-
culated by dividing measured weight in kilograms by
measured height in meters squared. Three to 4 systolic blood
pressure measurements were taken and were averaged by
using standardized protocols. Diabetes was defined as a fast-
ing serum glucose concentration of 126 mg/dL or higher,
a nonfasting serum glucose concentration of 200 mg/dL or
higher, a self-reported physician diagnosis, or current med-
ication use. Glomerular filtration rate was estimated by us-
ing the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study
equation with serum creatinine values (19).
Statistical methods
Participants were grouped in quartiles of serum sele-
nium levels based on the weighted population distribu-
tion. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for
peripheral arterial disease prevalence comparing the 3
highest quartiles of serum selenium with the lowest quar-
tile were estimated by using logistic regression. Tests for
linear risk trend across serum selenium quartiles were
performed by including an ordinal variable with the
median selenium level of each quartile in the logistic re-
gression models. To further explore the shape of the dose-
response relation between serum selenium levels and
peripheral arterial disease prevalence, we used restricted
quadratic splines with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th
percentiles of serum selenium distribution. These spline
models require the same number of parameters as the
quartile analysis, but they can accommodate a wide vari-
ety of smooth risk trends (20). Sensitivity analyses using
different numbers and locations of the knots, with cubic
instead of quadratic splines, and log-transforming serum
selenium levels gave similar results (not shown). Statisti-
cal analyses were performed with the survey package in R
software (to account for the complex sampling design in
NHANES 2003­2004) (21, 22). Strata, primary sampling
units, and examination sample weights were used to ob-
tain unbiased point estimates and robust linearized stan-
dard errors.

RESULTS
The weighted prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in
the study population was 4.9%. Compared with participants
without peripheral arterial disease, those with disease were
more likely to be older, black, ever smokers, nondrinkers, and
diabetic; to have a lower educational level and family in-
come; and to use cholesterol- and blood-pressure-lowering
medications (Table 1). Participants with peripheral arterial
disease, compared with those without disease, also had higher
average levels of body mass index, systolic blood pressure,
and C-reactive protein and lower high density lipoprotein
cholesterol levels and glomerular filtration rate.
Participants in the highest quartile of serum selenium
levels, compared with those in the lowest quartile, were
more likely to be older, men, white, and nonsmokers and
to use dietary supplements and cholesterol-lowering med-
ications (Table 2). Serum selenium levels were also positive-
ly associated with total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure and were inversely
associated with body mass index and serum cotinine levels.
The age-, sex-, and race-adjusted prevalence of peripheral
arterial disease decreased with increasing serum selenium
levels (P for linear trend ¼ 0.02) (Table 3). However, there
was an indication of an upturn in risk trend in the highest
quartile of serum selenium, particularly after adjusting for
cardiovascular risk factors. The fully adjusted odds ratios
for peripheral arterial disease comparing selenium quartiles
2, 3, and 4 with the lowest quartile were 0.75 (95% confi-
dence interval: 0.37, 1.52), 0.58 (95% confidence interval:
0.28, 1.19), and 0.67 (95% confidence interval: 0.34, 1.31),
respectively. In spline regression models, peripheral arterial
disease prevalence decreased with increasing serum sele-
nium levels up to 150­160 ng/mL (80th­91st percentiles
of the serum selenium distribution in the study population),
followed by a gradual increase at higher selenium levels
(Figure 1). Consistently, there was a marginally significant
U-shaped dose-response relation between serum selenium

DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional study, conducted in a representative
sample of the US population, the association between serum
selenium levels and the prevalence of peripheral arterial
disease was not statistically significant, although a U-shaped
relation was suggested: the prevalence of peripheral arterial
disease decreased with increasing serum selenium levels up
to 150 ng/mL but increased with increasing selenium levels
above 160 ng/mL. Selenium intake varies around the world
primarily because of geographic variation in the amount of
selenium in the soil (1, 23). In the United States, estimated
selenium intake ranges from 60 lg/day to 220 lg/day (23),
higher than the recommended dietary allowance for healthy
adults (55 lg/day) (4). As a consequence, serum selenium
levels in the United States are high: in NHANES 2003­
2004, the median selenium level was 134 ng/mL, and 99%
of study participants had serum selenium levels above 95
ng/mL. These concentrations are considerably higher than
in other countries. In Europe, for instance, average serum
selenium levels range from 50 ng/mL to 90 ng/mL (23, 24).
Very limited data are available on the association of
selenium with peripheral arterial disease. Two small studies
found similar selenium levels in patients with peripheral
arterial disease compared with controls, but the dose-
response relation was not evaluated (12, 13). For other car-
diovascular outcomes, most prospective studies have been

conducted in populations with suboptimal selenium levels in
Europe or China (3, 25­36). These studies tended to report
inverse associations between serum selenium levels and cor-
onary heart disease incidence, but their sample sizes were
too small for detailed dose-response analyses.
Findings from the only 2 prospective studies of serum
selenium levels and coronary heart disease conducted in
the United States, however, are consistent with a U-shaped
relation (6, 8). In the Physicians' Health Study, the relative
risks for incident myocardial infarction comparing quintiles
2­5 of plasma selenium with the lowest quintile were 0.87,
0.82, 0.60, and 1.53, respectively (6). The cutoff levels for
quintiles 1 and 5 of serum selenium in this study were 92
ng/mL and 134 ng/mL, respectively. In the NHANES III
Mortality Study, the relative risks for cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality comparing tertiles 2 and 3 of serum sele-
nium with the lowest tertile were 0.90 and 0.98,
respectively; for stroke mortality, the corresponding rel-
ative risks were 0.73 and 1.23 (8). The cutoff levels for
serum selenium tertiles in NHANES III were 117.3 ng/mL and
130.4 ng/mL, respectively. In this study, a dose-response anal-
ysis showed that cardiovascular and coronary heart disease
mortality decreased with increasing serum selenium levels
up to 120 ng/mL followed by an increase at higher levels,
although the U-shaped relation was not statistically significant
(8). Finally, in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, the
odds ratios for incident coronary heart disease comparing
quintiles 2­5 of toenail selenium levels with the first quintile
were 1.03, 0.99, 1.32, and 0.86, respectively, with no clear
dose-response relation (7). Both serum and toenail selenium
levels reflect selenium status, although toenails reflect longer-
term exposure. It is unclear, however, whether both biomarkers
are comparable in their ability to capture the different types of
selenium compounds.
Few randomized trials have evaluated the effect of selenium
supplementation on cardiovascular outcomes or atherosclero-
sis progression, and most of these studies combined selenium
with other vitamins and minerals (3, 37). Only 2 of these trials
were conducted in the United States, both reporting null results
(38, 39). In the Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial, the
relative risk for cardiovascular disease incidence comparing

200 lg/day of selenium supplementation with placebo was
1.03 (95% confidence interval: 0.78, 1.37) (38). In the HDL-
Atherosclerosis Treatment Study, the progression of athero-
sclerosis measured by coronary angiography in patients with
coronary artery disease was similar among participants ran-
domized to an antioxidant supplement containing 100 lg/day
of selenium, 800 IU/day of vitamin E, 1 g/day of vitamin C,
and 25 mg/day of b-carotene and participants randomized to
placebo (39). Overall, limited evidence from randomized trials
has not shown a protective effect of selenium supplementation
in US studies. With respect to observational studies, those in
the United States have not been able to detect a significant
linear association between serum selenium and cardiovascular
outcomes, but the dose-response associations in these studies
were U-shaped.
The biologic mechanisms underlying a potential effect of
selenium on cardiovascular disease are likely complex, but
they may be related to the dual role of selenium as an es-
sential and toxic element. Selenium is an essential micro-
nutrient that is incorporated into glutathione peroxidases
and other selenoproteins (4). Increasing serum selenium
levels increase the concentration and activity of glutathione
peroxidases, but this dose-response relation reaches a pla-
teau at serum selenium levels of 70­90 ng/mL (4). As a con-
sequence, higher selenium levels could potentially prevent
atherosclerosis development and progression in populations
whose selenium exposure is below the levels needed to
maximize glutathione peroxidases (1­3). In selenium-
replete populations such as in the United States, in which
virtually all participants have serum selenium levels above
70­90 ng/mL, the mechanisms underlying a potential ben-
eficial effect of increased selenium levels are unclear. Since
selenium supplementation is actively promoted in the
United States, and large randomized controlled trials testing
the efficacy of selenium supplementation in prostate cancer
prevention are under way (40, 41), mechanistic studies are
urgently needed to establish the biologic basis for a protec-
tive effect of selenium in populations whose selenium status
is already high.
Selenium, however, has a narrow therapeutic range (4),
and it may even be harmful at intake levels below the current
tolerable Upper Intake Level of 400 lg/day (2). In fact,
some selenium compounds have been documented to gen-
erate reactive oxygen species (42­44), and the upturn in
peripheral arterial disease prevalence that we observed at
selenium levels above 160 ng/mL could be associated with
selenium-induced increased oxidative stress. This upturn in
risk is also consistent with recent reports showing increased
risk of diabetes (45, 46) and elevated lipid levels (47) with
high selenium levels in US populations. For instance, the
Nutritional Prevention of Cancer trial showed an increased
risk of diabetes for participants receiving 200 lg/day of
selenium compared with placebo (hazard ratio ¼ 1.50,
95% confidence interval: 1.03, 2.33) (46). Interestingly,
the excess risk was limited to participants in the upper tertile
of the serum selenium distribution (>121.6 ng/mL), who
had a hazard ratio for diabetes of 2.70 (95% confidence
interval: 1.30, 5.61). Further research is needed to establish
the mechanisms underlying the association of high-normal
selenium levels with peripheral arterial disease and with
metabolic abnormalities, and to determine whether the
change point in risk associated with elevated selenium levels
depends on genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes for
selenium metabolism (48).
Several limitations of our study need to be considered.
The use of a cross-sectional design and of prevalent cases of
peripheral arterial disease limited our ability to determine
the direction and the causality of the observed association. It
is possible that the pathophysiologic changes of atheroscle-
rosis could modify serum selenium levels or that partici-
pants with peripheral arterial disease change their health
behaviors, including selenium intake through diet and di-
etary supplements. As a consequence, our findings must be
confirmed in prospective studies with incident cases of pe-
ripheral arterial disease. Another limitation of our study is
the use of a single measurement of serum selenium, which
reflects short-term selenium intake and may be subject to
high within-person variability (49). Furthermore, our study
measured only total serum selenium, and we did not have
information on selenoprotein levels or activity or about non-
specific incorporation of selenium as selenomethionine in
other plasma proteins. More detailed analysis of different
compartments of serum selenium will be needed to better
understand the association of selenium with peripheral
arterial disease. The strengths of our study come from
the rigorous sampling design and the quality of the study
measurements used in NHANES; the representativeness of
the NHANES sample; and the use of ABI, a noninvasive
measure of subclinical atherosclerosis.
In summary, the association between serum selenium lev-
els and the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease in
NHANES 2003­2004 was not statistically significant,
although a U-shaped relation was suggested. Other sources
of evidence (6, 8) also suggest a U-shaped relation between
serum selenium levels and cardiovascular outcomes in the
United States, a selenium-replete population. In many pop-
ulations worldwide, selenium intake is lower than in the
United States (1, 23). At these lower levels of selenium
intake, the association of selenium with peripheral arterial
disease remains unknown. Prospective studies of selenium
status across populations with different levels of selenium
intake and randomized trials stratified by baseline sele-
nium status are needed to establish the optimal selenium
levels to minimize the risk of cardiovascular and other
chronic diseases.
