Abstract: In this paper, we investigated the sexual activity levels of several subtypes of
middle adolescents (age 14-15 years). The subtype profiles were based on dominance-
popularity status and a range of behaviors associated with dominance and popularity. In
addition, gender differences in behavioral profiles were examined among dominant-
popular, sexually active young adolescents. Results showed that socially dominant and
popular young adolescent boys who exhibited a highly aggressive profile were more
sexually active than their low-status and non-aggressive male peers; dominant-popular girls
who were very attractive and gossips were more sexually active than their female peers.
The results are discussed from an evolutionary psychological framework.

Introduction
One of the most successful theses in evolutionary theorizing concerns the
association between social hierarchy position and sexual opportunity. Concisely stated,
individuals with higher status have increased access to mating opportunities (be it potential
or actual mates), potentially leading to higher reproductive success (Betzig, 1986;
Hopcroft, 2006; Kanazawa, 2003; Perusse, 1993). The present study was designed to
investigate this central thesis in middle adolescence. We propose that middle adolescence
presents an interesting phase in human ontogeny to test this thesis for two reasons. First, in
middle adolescence, status hierarchies based on social dominance, reputation, and
consensual popularity are ubiquitous, highly stable, and firmly embedded (Cillessen and
Hierarchies and sexual activity

Rose, 2005; Cillessen and Borch, 2006; Dong, Weisfeld, Boardway, and Shen, 1996;
Weisfeld, 1987). Second, emerging sexuality is fundamental to adolescence (Schlegel,
1995; Weisfeld, 1999; Weisfeld and Woodward, 2004). However, in middle adolescence
(14-15 years), access to mating opportunities is still a scarce resource, with mating
opportunities for some but not for others. We therefore hypothesized that high-status
middle adolescent individuals would be more sexually active than low-status middle
adolescent individuals.
Evolutionary Psychology: Status and Reproductive Success
Behavioral theories concerning sexual behavior, such as Sexual Selection Theory
(e.g., Andersson, 1994; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Darwin, 1871; Trivers, 1972) and Sexual
Strategies Theory (e.g., Buss, 2003) are firmly embedded in an evolutionary framework
and have successfully predicted one important reward that is bestowed on high-status
individuals: more mating opportunities and thus increased reproductive success (Barkow,
1989), particularly for males of most species. According to Betzig (1986), "hierarchical
power should predict a biased outcome in conflict resolution, which should in turn predict
size of the winner's harem, for men, a measure of success in reproduction" (p. 9). This is
true for human adults in many cultures, both `modern' as well as `primitive' (Betzig, 1986).
In fact, this theory seems to be confirmed for non-human primates (Cheney, 1983;
Cowlishaw and Dunbar, 1991; Dewsbury, 1982; Gray, 1985; Maslow, 1936) and other
animals from widely differing ecologies (Ellis, 1995) such as squirrels (Farentinos, 1972),
cockerels (Kratzer and Craig, 1980), and cockroaches (Breed, Smith, and Gall, 1980).
For females, it is generally argued that dominance is not necessarily a path to more
copulations, as it is for males. It appears that important benefits bestowed upon dominant
women are access to resources and less harassment from rivals (Campbell, 2002). Thus,
dominant females tend to have higher offspring survival rates, at least among simians
(Pusey, Williams, and Goodall, 1997); thus, dominance among females also appears to be
linked to reproductive success.
In humans, status hierarchies are continuously present across ontogeny, starting at
the age at which children first interact in small groups. Consequently, hierarchies based on
dominance, prestige, or consensual popularity are found among preschoolers (e.g., Hawley,
Johnson, Mize, and McNamara, 2007; Hawley and Little, 1999; Pellegrini, Roseth, Milner,
Bohn, Van Ryzin, Vance, Cheatham, and Tarullo, 2007; Strayer and Strayer, 1976), in
childhood (Omark, Omark, and Edelman, 1975; Zeller, Vannatta, Shafer, and Noll, 2003),
in adolescence (De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a, 2006b; Hawley, 2003; Savin-Wiliams,
1976; 1977; 1979; 1980a; 1980b), and in adulthood (Austin and Bates, 1974; Cummins,
2005; Hawley, 1999). From a Darwinian view, high status should carry some kind of
reward or privilege (Henrich and Gil-White, 2001). These rewards range from toys in
toddlerhood to an increase in quality and quantity of mates in adulthood.
Status Hierarchies in Middle Adolescence
School systems in Western society place individuals from the age of toddlerhood up
into late adolescence in small groups (classrooms of up to 30 students) of same-aged peers
for long periods of time (8 hours daily, 5 days a week). This educational organization is
fertile ground for the formation of status hierarchies and developmental psychologists are
increasingly identifying the behaviors that determine the emergence of peer status in
Hierarchies and sexual activity

middle adolescence. The main status hierarchy in middle adolescence is based on
dominance, prestige, and reputation, often referred to as perceived popularity (Cillessen
and Rose, 2005; Parkhurst and Hopmeyer, 1998), judgmental popularity (Babad, 2001),
reputational popularity (Prinstein and Cillessen, 2003), or consensual popularity (De
Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005; De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a). The last term reflects the
fact that this type of popularity does not measure personal liking but the shared view of the
peer group of who is socially dominant or socially central. The terms social dominance and
consensual popularity are both in common usage in the child and adolescent psychological
literature. However, the term popularity never applies to non-humans, and considering that
the present article intends to provide an evolutionarily framed explanation of adolescent
behavior by drawing on information from both animal and human research, we decided to
use the term dominant-popular to indicate adolescent individuals who are at the top of the
social dominance cum reputation-based popularity hierarchy.
Dominant-popular middle adolescents tend to be attractive, fashionable, athletic
(especially in the US, but less so in, for instance, China, e.g., Dong, et al., 1996), and
aggressive and high in bullying (Cillessen and Mayeux, 2004; Cillessen and Rose, 2005;
De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a, 2006b, 2010; Parkhurst and Hopmeyer, 1998). Thus, in
most modern Western societies, the dominance-popularity hierarchy in middle adolescence
is a well-described hierarchical organization of which individuals at the high end exhibit an
idiosyncratic behavioral profile based on a combination of attractiveness, sartorial finesse,
and aggression or fighting ability.
Sex as a Scarce Resource in Middle Adolescence
In Western societies, most middle adolescence children enter pubescence.
Pubescence is sexual maturation and, not surprisingly, an important main motivational
change takes place in middle adolescence around sexual behavior (Jones and Bayley, 1950;
Weisfeld, 1999). In middle adolescence, sexual relationships are becoming an important,
yet scarce, resource for both boys and girls (Pellegrini and Bartini, 2001). Thus, it appears
that some adolescents have many partners, some have one, but the majority has none
(Sorensen, 1973; Laumann, Gagnon, Michael, and Michaels, 1994) making middle
adolescence a time of great competitiveness for the same sexually active peers. Cultural
variability between Western and tribal societies does exist, where in the majority of tribal
societies, premarital sex during puberty is typical for boys and girls (Broude and Greene,
1976). However, the present article is concerned with a typical modern society in Western
Europe.
Although the idea of sexual relationships has firmly inundated the adolescent mind,
taking the first step of approach or flirtation towards someone else is risky. By doing so, an
adolescent crosses the boundary of sex-segregation that has been in place since middle
childhood (Maccoby 1998; Pellegrini and Long, 2003). Any initiative towards a member of
the opposite sex may end in rejection and public humiliation. Thus, it is hypothesized that it
takes an adolescent with a certain behavioral repertoire and status to cross that boundary. It
is unlikely that this type of middle adolescent is at the bottom of the peer group hierarchy,
but is more likely to be a high-status, dominant-popular peer.
The notion of sex as a resource, for which adolescents compete intensely, is not
new. Several developmental psychologists have postulated this notion (e.g., Pellegrini,
2002; Pellegrini and Bartini, 2001; Weisfeld, 1999; Weisfeld and Woodward, 2004).
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -299-
Several studies point towards the notion that adolescents who display behaviors typical of
dominant-popular peers are more sexually active than low-ranking ones. For instance,
Mazur, Halpern, and Udry (1994) revealed that dominant looking males had more coital
opportunities than submissive looking ones. Adolescent boys high in toughness and
fighting ability appeared popular with girls (Feldman and Weisfeld, 1973) and bullies have
been found to date relatively early (Connolly, Pepler, Craig, and Taradash, 2000). More
recent studies in the US have reported a positive association between dominance-popularity
status and sexual activity (Mayeux, Sandstrom, and Cillessen, 2008) and the practice of
oral sex (Prinstein, Meade and Cohen, 2003), both studies conducted among older
adolescents. However, we were unable to find studies of the relationship between
dominance-popularity status and actual sexual activity in middle adolescence. Pellegrini
and Bartini (2001) and Pellegrini and Long (2003) probably have come closest to
confirming this relationship by using dating popularity as a proxy for sexual activity. The
present study was designed to fill this lacuna by asking middle adolescents about their
actual sexual activity. Therefore:
Hypothesis 1: High dominant-popular adolescents report higher sexual activity levels than
their low dominant-popular peers.
Dominance-Popularity and Gender Differences in Behavior
An important question is whether we should expect gender differences in the
behavioral repertoire associated with dominance and sexual activity. Barkow (1989)
predicted that intersexual (mate choice) selection by females depends on three criteria.
First, desirable males should possess an agonistic quality based on physique; second,
desirable males should show willingness to provide parental investment; and third, they
should display the ability for parental investment. However, parental investment should
matter less in middle adolescence than in adulthood, considering the fluidity of dating in
middle adolescence and the preponderance of short-term relationships (Laumann, et al.,
1994; Sorensen, 1973). Relevant to this line of reasoning is that adult women, when
seeking short-term relationships, placed great emphasis on adult male physical prowess
(Buss and Schmitt, 1993). Also, Campbell (1995; 1999) argued that the rise in male
aggression found in early adolescence (e.g., Björkvist, Lagerspetz, and Kaukianen, 1992)
was likely due to both intrasexual competition with the aim of subduing rivals, and
intersexual competition with the aim of displaying attributes that attract females (Campbell,
1999). In the case of middle adolescent males, both strategies are greatly abetted by
physical strength and agonistic behavior. Pellegrini and colleagues (Pellegrini and Bartini,
2001; Pellegrini and Long, 2003) also showed that aggression to gain dominance was
positively related to hypothetical dating preference. The present research will look at sexual
activity level instead of hypothetical dating preferences. Therefore, we expected a strong
association among middle adolescent males between aggression and sexual activity. Hence:
Hypothesis 2: Sexually active middle adolescent boys are high in fighting and bullying
behaviors.
A different behavioral profile was expected of sexually precocious middle
adolescent girls. Based on principles derived from evolutionary psychology, Campbell
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -300-
(1995; 1999; 2002, 2004) argued that females use both passive and active strategies
towards intersexual mate attraction and intrasexual competition. The passive strategy is a
demonstration of attributes that are valued highly by males, such as youth and beauty.
Several studies among adults have demonstrated this strategy (Buss and Barnes, 1986;
Rhodes, 2006; Rhodes, Simmons, and Peters, 2005). In fact, physical attractiveness among
girls probably serves as a two-sided sword: attracting interesting males and also
intimidating other girls (Campbell, 2002). The active strategy is aimed at subduing rivals,
and girls thereby gain access to valuable resources and the best mates. Although it is
correct to say that women do not really have to fight each other in order to mate (because
they can always find a willing male), it makes sense for them to vie for the highest quality
mates available. In fact, research has shown that antagonism is as rife among girls as it is
among boys, with a similar peak in middle adolescence (e.g., Björkvist et al., 1992).
However, due to the greater risk to their reproductive fitness and the fact that females gain
less from multiple matings secured by fighting than do males, females tend to avoid direct
physical confrontations (Campbell, 1995, 1999; Daly and Wilson, 1994), instead relying on
ridicule, defamation, shunning, and malicious gossip (Björkvist et al., 1992; Hess and
Hagen, 2006; Savin-Williams, 1987). Indeed, Pellegrini and Long (2003) showed that
middle adolescent girls' success at dating was associated with indirect aggression such as
gossip. Also, a link has been found between aggression among girls and their subsequent
number of children (Underwood, Kupersmidt, and Coie, 1996), indicating a reproductive
fitness payoff, even for females. Thus:
Hypothesis 3: Sexually active middle adolescent girls are physically attractive and high in
relational aggression such as gossip.
Research Goals of the Present Study
This study examined different types of middle adolescents through an individual
differences approach by examining status and behavioral profiles consisting of dominance-
popularity status, behavioral repertoire, and sexual activity in middle adolescence. It was
hypothesized that highly dominant-popular middle adolescents who display high levels of
aggression (physical for boys, relational for girls) and attractiveness (in particular for girls),
are relatively sexually precocious at the age of 14 years.
Materials and Methods
Participants and Procedure
The target sample consisted of 381 middle adolescents aged 14-to-15 years (190
boys, 191 girls, M age = 14.42, SD = .52), who formed the complete third-year cohort of
two secondary schools in The Netherlands. Because a few students were absent during
testing due to illness or other reasons, the actual sample consisted of 354 students (177
boys, 177 girls).
The data came from an ongoing project on school behavior and achievement across
adolescence, and were collected in early spring at two high schools in two different cities in
The Netherlands. Prior to data collection, the school board sent a letter to all parents
containing detailed information about the study. Parents were informed that students would
be asked about their behaviors (e.g., interpersonal and sexual) and their peers' behaviors.
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -301-
The letter indicated that student participation was voluntary. Parents could return the letter
if they did not wish their child to participate. According to Dutch law, IRB approval was
not needed for this study due to its non-experimental nature. None of the parents refused
participation.
Research assistants administered the computer-based questionnaire to students
individually during quiet study periods at school. Students had been informed that
participation was voluntary and that their answers would be kept confidential. In addition,
student assent was obtained on the day of data collection. Immediately prior to testing,
students were reminded of the goals of the study and the voluntary nature of their
participation. All students present at the time of data collection agreed to participate and
completed the questionnaire. It was not possible to hold makeup sessions at a later date for
students who were absent on the day of testing (13 boys and 14 girls)
Measures
Peer nominations. In order to collect data regarding participants' social status and
social behaviors, sociometric methods were used. Students were presented with a list of
names of all classmates in which the first names were in alphabetical order. A computer
program ensured that a student's own name did not appear in this list. Although students in
the participating schools share breaks in common areas, the majority of school time (7 to 8
hours daily) was spent with students from their own classroom. Therefore, nominations
were restricted to the student's own classroom. Cross-gender voting was permitted.
Dominance-popularity, social behavior, and appearance. Positive and negative
nominations were solicited for ten constructs. These constructs fell into four groups: social
dominance-popularity, antisocial behavior, prosocial behavior, and physical appearance.
For each construct, participants were again asked to name three classmates who displayed it
the most and three who displayed it the least. By using both positive and negative
nominations, a broad picture of adolescents' traits and behaviors was obtained. Dominance-
popularity was assessed by two separate constructs, social dominance and consensual
popularity. Social dominance was assessed by asking participants to nominate three
classmates who "played the boss" most and three classmates who "played the boss" least.
In Dutch "Playing the boss" corresponds most closely to the concept of being dominant.
Asking directly who is most and least dominant was not comprehended well by
respondents in pilot studies. In addition to social dominance, a traditional measure of
adolescent peer group status was assessed: consensual popularity. Participants were asked
to indicate three classmates who were most popular and three classmates who were least
popular. Antisocial behavior was measured by nominating three classmates who displayed
the following behaviors most and three who displayed these behaviors least: "is mean," and
"bullies." Two other types of antisocial behavior were investigated, physical and relational
aggression. Physical aggression was assessed by nominations of three classmates who
"fight" most and three who "fight" least. Relational aggression was assessed by
nominations of three classmates who "gossip" most and three who do this least. Prosocial
behavior was measured with three most and three least nominations of "keeps promises"
and three most and three least nominations of being "friendly". The former has been shown
to be correlated with being considered friendly (e.g., De Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005).
Also, keeping promises has been argued to be the cornerstone of the evolution of reciprocal
altruism, or `tit-for-tat' behavior (Axelrod, 1984). Finally, physical attractiveness was
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -302-
measured by most and least nominations of "attractive" and "dressing hip".
In addition, five constructs were included for cluster analysis validating purposes
(e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a): leadership, friendships, academic behaviors, being
victimized, and being considered boring. The first was assessed by asking participants to
nominate three classmates they consider most like a leader and three they consider least
like a leader. The second was assessed by asking participants to nominate three classmates
whom they consider their best friends and three classmates with whom they would never
want to be friends. Academic behavior was assessed by asking participants to nominate
three classmates who "showed disrespect to teachers" most and three who showed
disrespect to teachers least, and three classmates who "are attentive in class" most and three
who were least attentive in class. For victimization, participants were asked to nominate
classmates who were victimized most. For being considered boring, participants were
asked to nominate three classmates who were most, and three classmates who were least
boring. Each validating construct was chosen because past research had shown high
associations with the clustering variables used in the cluster analysis. For instance, being
considered a leader is closely related to dominance-popularity; the number of nominated
friendships is highly associated with being considered friendly; academic behavior is
associated with dominance-popularity, in particular for a subgroup of dominant-popular
students (see, e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a; Farmer, Estell, Bishop, O'Neal, and
Cairns, 2003; Jonkmann, Trautwein, and Lüdtke, 2009); and being considered boring has
been shown to be highly correlated with low dominance-popularity (e.g., De Bruyn and
Cillessen, 2006a; De Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005).
For all of the above nomination constructs, the difference between the number of
positive and negative nominations received was computed for each student and
standardized within classrooms.
Sexual activity. Middle adolescent sexual activity was assessed by two methods,
self-report and a report by a designated "social expert". The first method consisted of
asking each participant whether or not they had engaged in (1) kissing, (2) heavy petting
(defined as genital touching and/or oral sex), and (3) sexual intercourse. The phrasing of
these questions followed procedures from a nationwide Dutch questionnaire on sexuality in
adolescence conducted by the Dutch Ministry of Health (De Graaf, Meijer, Poelman, and
Vanwesenbeeck, 2005). Subsequently, participants were categorized into three groups:
those who had done "nothing," those who had "only kissed," and those who had engaged in
"heavy petting and/or intercourse."
The second method consisted of interviewing social experts about the sexual
activity of classmates. Social experts were appointed by the headmaster of each class in
response to the question `which two boys and two girls in your class are the most
knowledgeable about their classmates' social lives?' The social experts were interviewed
privately and were asked to indicate each classmate's sexual activity level in the same
wording as the self-report. If they had no knowledge about a classmate's sexual activity,
they left their answer blank. The rank-order correlation between self-reports and social
experts was .78 (P < .01), validating the self-report of sexual activity. Subsequently, the
self-reported data were used in the analyses.

Results are presented in four sections. First, descriptive statistics of all variables are
presented. Second, cluster analyses were conducted as an individual differences person-
centered method in order to identify groups of adolescents with idiosyncratic patterns of
status and behavior (e.g., De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a). Third, the clusters were
compared in terms of their sexual activity level. And fourth, a variable-centered approach
was applied, in which an ANOVA was used to identify differences in behavior and sexual
activity level at the univariate level. In order to investigate multivariate associations
between status, behavior, and sexual activity, a discriminant function analysis was
conducted. This multiple-method approach is very pertinent to identifying subgroups of
adolescents as well as the specific behaviors associated with differing levels of sexual
activity. A good example of this kind of multi-method approach is Jonkmann, et al.'s
(2009) study on the heterogeneity of social dominance behaviors. Gender was included in
all analyses.

Identification and Description of Clusters
We chose cluster analysis as the first method of analysis because of the person-
centered approach. This approach has been very fruitful in the past in discovering subtypes
of individuals who may be high on one dimension (e.g., dominance-popularity) but who
may differ widely on other dimensions, such as aggression and likeability (e.g., De Bruyn
and Cillessen, 2006a; Farmer, et al., 2003; Jonkmann et al., 2009).
Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify boys and girls on the basis of
dominance-popularity status, friendliness, and the behavioral dimensions. In order to
minimize within-cluster variance, Ward's method of clustering was used (Aldenderfer and
Blashfield, 1984). This resulted in a three-cluster solution for both genders. Because cluster
solution is affected by sample size, membership stability was tested by applying the same
cluster technique to a two-thirds random selection of the original sample. This new cluster
analysis revealed a stable pattern with 87% of the participants maintaining their original
cluster membership.
Boys. A 3 (Cluster) MANOVA was conducted on the scores for dominance-
popularity, friendliness, and the behavioral dimensions. A significant multivariate effect of
cluster was found, F20, 330

Post-hoc comparisons with Bonferonni corrections demonstrated how the three
clusters of boys differed on the clustering variables (see Table 2). Based on these
comparisons, the clusters were described as follows: High Dominant-Popular (N = 32,
18%), boys were characterized as very dominant-popular, playing the boss, fighting a lot,
being mean, bullies, attractive, and dressing hip. They were judged low on friendliness and
low on keeping promises. The second cluster was named Average Boys (N = 117, 62%),
considering that as a group, these boys were judged average in dominance-popularity and
they did not display extreme behaviors. The third cluster was named Low Dominant-
Popular (N = 28, 15%). The latter group's behavioral profile was characterized by very low
scores on dominance-popularity, friendliness, playing the boss, fighting, gossip, mean,
attractive, and hip dress.

Post-hoc comparisons with Bonferonni corrections demonstrated how the three
clusters of girls differed on the clustering variables (see Table 3). This led to the following
cluster descriptions. High Dominant-Popular (N = 28, 17%). Girls in this cluster were
judged as highly dominant-popular, playing the boss, gossips, mean, bully, attractive, and
hip dressed. They were judged low on friendliness and keeping promises. The second
cluster was named Average Girls (N = 88, 46%). The third cluster was called Low
Dominant-Popular (N = 61, 32%) based on their behavioral profile. The profile of girls in
this cluster was characterized by low scores on dominance-popularity, playing the boss,
fighting, gossiping, being mean, bullying, attractiveness, and dressing hip.
Validation of Clusters
The clusters were further validated by comparing them on six variables not used to
generate the clusters: leadership nominations, number of friendship nominations, being
victimized, being disrespectful to teachers, being attentive in class, and being considered
boring (for an example of this type of validation, see De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a).
These variables have all been found to be highly associated with social dominance and
popularity in previous studies. For both boys and girls, a 3 (Cluster) MANOVA was
conducted on these variables. The multivariate effect of cluster was significant for both
boys and girls. For boys, the multivariate effect was F12, 338
= 31.74, P < .001, partial 2 =
.53. Univariate effects were significant for each variable. For leadership nominations, F2,
174
= 89.69, 2 = .51; for number of friendship nominations F2, 174
= 21.88, partial 2 = .20;
for being victimized, F2, 174
= 44.49, partial 2 = .34; for disrespect to teachers, F2, 174
=
88.86, partial 2 = .51; for being attentive in class, F2, 174
= 27.63, partial 2 = .24 and for
being considered boring, F2, 174
= 94.77, partial 2
For girls, the multivariate effect was F
= .52 (All P < .001). Bonferroni
corrected paired comparisons (see Table 2) indicated that High Dominant-Popular boys
were chosen more often as leader than Average Boys and Low Dominant-Popular boys.
High Dominant-Popular boys were nominated less often as a friend than Average Boys, but
did not differ from Low Dominant-Popular boys on this dimension. High Dominant-
Popular boys were highest in disrespect to teachers and lowest in attentiveness in class.
Also, High Dominant-Popular boys were considered least boring. Low Dominant-Popular
boys were victimized most and were most respectful to teachers. Low Dominant-Popular
boys were also considered very boring.

Univariate effects were significant for all variables. For leadership nominations, F2, 174

= 26.00, partial 2 = .23 and for
being considered boring, F2, 174
= 50.95, partial 2 = .37 (All P < .001). Bonferroni
corrected paired comparisons indicated that High Dominant-Popular girls received more
leadership nominations than either Average Girls or Low Dominant-Popular girls (see
Table 3). High Dominant-Popular girls received fewer friendship nominations than
Average Girls, but equal to Low Dominant-Popular girls. High Dominant-Popular girls
were very disrespectful to teachers and low in attentiveness in class. Low Dominant-
Popular girls were considered very boring, very attentive in class, and they were not
disrespectful to teachers. Also, Low Dominant-Popular girls were victimized most.

Sexual Activity by Gender
The self-report measures of sexual activity indicated that for boys, 24% (n = 42)
had done `nothing', 46% (n = 82) had `only kissed', and 30% (n = 53) had engaged in
`heavy petting and/or intercourse'. For girls, 24% (n = 42) had done `nothing', 51% (n =
90) had `only kissed', and 25% (n = 45) had engaged in `heavy petting and/or intercourse'.
These numbers are comparable to national average estimates reported by De Graaf et al.
(2005), who indicated that an estimated 16% of 14-year old boys and 29% of 15-year old
boys had had sexual intercourse. For girls, these national average estimates were 11% at
age 14 and 29% at age 15.
Sexual Activity by Cluster
To address the main research question of this study, the three clusters were
compared on sexual activity. Boys in the High Dominant-Popular cluster reported the
highest level of sexual activity: 69% reported having engaged in heavy petting and/or
intercourse. The percentages for the other clusters were: Average Boys, 25%; and Low
Dominant-Popular boys, 7.1% (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Sexual activity level by cluster membership for middle adolescent boys.
Planned comparisons indicated a significant difference in the level of sexual activity
between the High Dominant-Popular cluster and the other two clusters. The difference in
sexual activity between High Dominant-Popular and Average boys was 44% (z = 4.44; P <
.01; CI99%
= .21 - .67) and the difference between High Dominant-Popular and Low
Dominant-Popular boys was 62% (z = 4.62; P < .01; CI99%
For girls, the highest level of sexual activity was reported for the High Dominant-
Popular cluster: 68% of them reported having engaged in heavy petting and/or intercourse.

The percentages for the other clusters were: Average Girls, 24%; Low Dominant-Popular,

Figure 2. Sexual activity level by cluster membership for middle adolescent girls.
Planned comparisons indicated a significant difference between the sexual activity
level of the High Dominant-Popular cluster and the other two clusters. The difference in

= .18 - .70) and the difference between High Dominant-Popular and
Low Dominant-Popular girls was 60% (z = 5.89; P < .01; CI99%
In summary, middle adolescent boys and girls high in dominance-popularity
appeared to have had earlier sexual encounters than their peers, thereby confirming the
main hypothesis of this study. Also confirmed was the fact that these boys were very
aggressive, bossy and bullies. They were also considered very attractive. As expected, the
highly dominant-popular girls were considered very attractive and high in relational
aggression.
= .35 - .84).
Univariate Analyses of Behavior and Sexual Activity Level
In addition to the person-centered method of cluster analysis, we chose to also
perform a variable-centered approach, namely ANOVA. The ANOVA's showed that
middle adolescents who had performed heavy petting and/or intercourse differed
remarkably from peers who had done `nothing' or merely kissed. In fact, they differed
significantly on all behavioral aspects except being friendly and being nominated as best
friend (see Table 4).

Thus, middle adolescents who were at the high level of sexual activity were judged
more dominant-popular, more bossy, fought more, gossiped more, were meaner, bullied
more, were more attractive, hip dressed, more of a leader, more disrespectful to teachers,
less attentive in class, and considered less boring than peers at lower levels of sexual
activity. Some gender differences were also apparent. A comparison of sexually active
adolescent boys and girls revealed that sexually active boys fought far more than sexually
active girls (F1,96
= 36.99; P < .01; 2 = .59). Sexually active girls, however, were
considered slightly more attractive, more fashionable, and far more gossipy than sexually
active boys (F1,96
= 3.80; P = .05; 2 = .05; F1,96
= 6.14; P < .05; 2 = .11; F1,96
= 37.85; P <
.01; 2 = .73, respectively).
Multivariate Analysis of Behavior and Sexual Activity Level
In order to assess the relative contributions of the individual behaviors as assessed
by univariate analyses (see the above section), a Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA;
Tabachnik and Fidell, 2007) was performed for boys and girls separately. After inspection
of the univariate analyses (see Table 4), it appeared that the largest group differences
encountered were between adolescents who had intercourse versus the rest. Based on this
inspection, we decided to combine adolescents who had done nothing with those who had
merely kissed, thereby creating two groups, non-sex versus sex. All variables were then
Hierarchies and sexual activity

entered into the DFA in order to predict the respective group membership.

The DFA for boys yielded one discriminant function, with Wilks' Lambda = 0.75
(2 (18) = 47.25; P < .001; Eigenvalue = .33). The structure matrix for each gender is
shown in Table 5. In general, boys who had had sex distinguished themselves from boys
who had not had sex in overall negative behavior such as being bossy, fighting,
disrespecting teachers, gossiping, bullying, non-attentive in class, and mean. They were
also considered less boring, more of a leader, more dominant-popular, and more attractive.
For boys, 77.4% of the original cases were correctly classified, with most misclassifications
a result of boys who had had sex to be classified as not having had sex. For girls, one
discriminant function was revealed, with Wilks' Lambda = 0.64 (2
In sum, the multivariate method of analysis through DFA revealed that middle
adolescent girls and boys who had had sex displayed highly dominant behavior and many
(18) = 73.06 ; P <
.001; Eigenvalue = .55). In general, girls who had had sex distinguished themselves from
girls who had not had sex in overall negative behaviors such as being bossy, disrespecting
teachers, gossiping, inattentive during class, being mean, bullying, and not keeping
promises. Also, they were considered more of a leader, more dominant-popular, and hip
dressed. For girls, 85.3% of the original cases were classified correctly, with most
misclassifications due to girls who had had sex classified as not having had sex.

negative peer-directed and teacher-directed behaviors, and were considered far more
dominant-popular than adolescents who had not yet had sex.
Discussion
The present study confirmed the three hypotheses stated in the introduction. That is,
middle adolescents who are highly dominant-popular and who also display high levels of
bullying and (relational) aggression are sexually precocious. Individuals at the other end of
the status and behavior spectrum, i.e., low dominant-popular, withdrawn, and victimized
middle adolescents, are the least sexually precocious. The hypothesized gender differences
in behavioral profile of sexually precocious adolescents were also confirmed. That is,
sexually active middle adolescent boys were highly dominant-popular and physically
aggressive (and also attractive), and sexually active middle adolescent girls were highly
dominant-popular, attractive and relationally aggressive.
Adolescence marks the beginning of sexual maturation, and is thus a time when
within-sex competition should rise. Sexual strategies theory (Buss, 2003; Campbell, 2002)
predicts that both sexes set out to win this competition: boys through overt aggression and
bullying, girls through being attractive and using relational aggression. By using
aggression, middle adolescent boys can show off their strength and dominance to their male
rivals and to potential female mates (Pellegrini, 2002). Bullying may be a successful way
for them to lower their rivals' chances of romantic success. It is also a signal to the opposite
sex that they are interesting and should be given attention. In fact, intra-sexual competition
probably evolved through the process of sexual selection (Buss, 1996; Darwin, 1871). That
is, what predicts a top ranking among sex-mates (intra-sexual competition) is also what
members of the opposite sex look for in potential mates (inter-sexual competition). Thus,
there is just one hierarchy for each sex (e.g., Weisfeld, Bloch, and Ivers, 1983; 1984).
For girls and boys, physical attractiveness was positively associated with a high
peer group status and sexual activity. The positive association between attractiveness and
status in middle adolescence has been shown before, but the current study also shows
connections with sexual behavior. Also, Udry and Billy (1987) found that US adolescent
girls (ages 14-17) with high testosterone and high attractiveness had the strongest sex
drives. It is no surprise that intra-sex competition among girls is aimed at lowering rivals'
status (derived from their attractiveness) through derogation. Buss and Dedden (1990)
showed that in the US, reputation-hurting through gossip is common among girls. In a UK
study, Duncan (2004) also showed that this derogation is often aimed at humiliating a girl
for her sexual success, for example, through name calling. Also, Campbell (2002), studying
female gangs in the UK and the US, has cogently argued that reputation-bashing among
girls is most likely aimed at sexual promiscuity, that is, calling a girl a `whore' or `slut' is
the most effective way of destroying a girl's reputation among peers. Other studies
conducted in Mexico (Fry, 1992), Bolivia (Holmberg, 1969), Argentina (Hines and Fry,
1994) and the US (Campbell, 1994) showed that intra-female competition is rife, fierce,
and invariably involves a sexual partner.
We suggest that highly dominant-popular adolescent boys have Resource Holding
Power (RHP), whereas highly dominant-popular adolescent girls have some RHP, but rely
also and perhaps more heavily on Social Attention Holding Power (SAHP; Gilbert, Price,
and Allan, 1995). Gilbert et al. typified RHP as a `threat' display (i.e., the individual gains
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -312-
power through direct aggression), and SAHP as an `attractive' display (the individual gains
power through attractive personal qualities). Both types of power, however, make the
individual feel esteemed. In fact, a positive association has been found between self-esteem
and status (De Bruyn and Van den Boom, 2005). Also, self-esteem takes a prominent place
in Barkow's (1989) theorizing about status and reproductive success. He postulated that
self-esteem consists mainly of "an ongoing comparison of the self-representation with the
representation of others" (p. 180). This comparison process takes place whenever people
are in groups. Barkow invoked Chance's concept of attention structure (Chance, 1967) to
indicate that most comparison encounters need not be physically agonistic, which would
indicate a RHP strategy, but may simply consist of who attends to whom, which indicates a
SAHP strategy. However, the notion of attention structure being the primary dimension of
primate dominance-popularity hierarchies has been criticized by Hinde (1974; see also
Schubert, 1983). Hinde agreed that dominant males in primate groups are attention-catchers
through displays of dominant behavior. But, he argues, these displays invariably show off
physical prowess and frighten others. Also, subordinates tend to monitor or pay attention to
dangerous dominant troop members. Thus, attention seems to be a byproduct of dominance
displays--at least among simians--and male dominant primates attract attention through
dominance displays that are in turn evidence to rivals and potential mates of a high RHP.
To rivals, the displays convey the message to back down, while to potential mates, they are
a sign of good genes.
How do our findings contribute to the understanding of dominance-popularity
behaviors among (adolescent) humans? Human ontogeny is marked by dominant bullying
behavior and resource control: toddlers vie for the most interesting toys; adolescents (and
adults) vie for the most interesting partners. Also, being successful in gaining control over
resources early in life may actually have lasting consequences later in ontogeny (e.g.,
Weisfeld, 1987). Gaining resources through dominant behaviors such as bullying is thus
reinforced through rewards (resource acquisition) and perhaps this learning mechanism
may help explain the tenacity and ubiquity of bullying. It may not be a coincidence that
bullying increases at this age (Björkvist et al., 1992; Cairns and Cairns, 1986). Adolescence
is, after all, a developmental period marked by the crossing of gender boundaries in search
for sexual opportunities. Intra-sex competition for these opportunities is high and recent
retrospective research confirms that bullying and victimization may be linked to
reproductive behavior (Gallup, O'Brien, White, and Sloan Wilson, 2009; White, Gallup,
and Gallup, 2010). Thus, the struggle for sexual opportunities may be a factor in the
prevalence of bullying and victimization in secondary schools.
In addition to bullying, anti-authority displays (e.g., receiving low grades and being
disrespectful to teachers) are very typical for dominant-popular boys as well as girls (e.g.,
Adler and Adler, 1995; Adler, Kless, and Adler, 1992; De Bruyn and Cillessen, 2006a;
2006b; Rodkin, Farmer, Pearl, and Van Acker, 2000). Perhaps these anti-authority displays
are part and parcel of the dominant-popular behavioral profile. They may benefit the
displayer in several ways: by impressing classmates ("oh, look how cool I am to defy this
teacher!") or by acting the class-clown they show defiance and humor (in particular
reducing the low dominant classmates to a laughing stock). Also, by defying and
challenging authority they show their strength, fortitude, courage, leadership, and raw
power, all of which probably serve a two-pronged goal: impress the opposite sex and scare
off rivals. Could these behaviors capture the essence of a newly discussed construct called
Hierarchies and sexual activity
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(2). 2012. -313-
Mating Intelligence (Geher and Miller, 2008)? Future research should concentrate on
delineating the behavioral factors underlying successful (and unsuccessful) adolescent
sexual mating mechanisms.
There were some limitations to this study. The first is the `implicit' fact-finding
nature of cluster analysis. This method relies solely on statistical criteria to find subgroups.
Other methods to identify subgroups should also be used in future studies, such as
ethnography, interviews, or observations. Second, an important question regarding the
positive association between dominance-popularity and sexual activity centers on
directionality. Sexual selection theory suggests that status precedes and predicts sexual
activity. The present study, however, is correlational and statements about causality should
be avoided. Thus, the statement being dominant-popular in a group and behaving
aggressively leads to sex is just as probable as sex leads to being considered dominant-
popular and behaving aggressively. However, this line of reasoning becomes harder to
maintain when we consider the strong association between dominance, behavior, and
sexual activity. Remember, it was the dominant-aggressive boys and girls who were
sexually most active, and the proposition that sexual activity should lead to dominant-
aggressive behavior is harder to maintain than the reverse, i.e., dominant-aggressive
behavior leads to increased sexual activity. Why would an individual who gained access to
a sexual mate become more aggressive? That makes much less sense than an aggressive
individual securing sole access to a willing mate. Longitudinal studies will help to address
these questions of directionality and causality. Also, an alternative explanation is plausible,
such that both sexual activity and dominance behavior are somehow `driven' by a third
variable, perhaps a personality type akin to a Machiavellian profile: cunning, smart, savvy,
and high in opportunistic aggression (Byrne and Whiten, 1988; Whiten and Byrne, 1997).
If so, then the behavioral profiles of attractive-dominant girls and aggressive-dominant
boys uncovered in the current study seem to fit the bill to a certain degree. Further studies
should investigate this hypothesis. Also, the findings of the current research apply to
adolescents in a modern Western society, in this case The Netherlands. One must always be
very cautious in extending findings from one culture to the human species as a whole.
Future studies should look into cultures that are vastly different in, for instance, school
organization and sexual permissiveness.
In spite of these limitations, this study provides an important step towards
understanding the association between middle adolescent peer status, interpersonal
behavior, and sexual activity. This study showed that middle adolescents' sexual behavior
is related to dominant-popularity status, in combination with certain idiosyncratic behaviors
of boys and girls that enhance their competitiveness within their own gender, in particular,
aggression and appearance. This study also shows that sexual strategies theory and the
evolutionary perspective provide a framework to understand these associations.
