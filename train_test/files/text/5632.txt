Abstract
Objective: Ketamine-associated cystitis (KAC) has been described in a few case reports, but its
treatment in a relatively large number of patients has not been documented. This study aimed to
describe our experience of treatment of 36 patients with KAC.
Methods: Thirty-six patients (30 males and 6 females, aged 19­38 years) with KAC, who had
previously taken a muscarinic receptor blocker and/or antibiotics, but without symptomatic relief,
were treated with botulinum toxin A injection combined with bladder hydrodistention.
Urodynamic testing, and the O'Leary­Sant interstitial cystitis symptom index (ICSI) and problem
index (ICPI) were used to evaluate baseline values and improvement before and after the
treatment.
Results: One month post-treatment, all patients achieved marked relief of symptoms. The
nocturia time was markedly reduced, while bladder capacity, the interval between micturition,
the void volume, and the maximum flow rate were remarkably increased at 1 month. Additionally,
the ICSI and ICPI were significantly improved.
Conclusion: Botulinum toxin A injection along with bladder hydrodistention is effective for
managing KAC.

Introduction
Ketamine, an antagonist of N-methyl-D-
aspartate receptor, is mainly used in the
induction and maintenance of anaesthesia,
especially in paediatric anesthaesia.1,2
Ketamine is also applied for management
of pain.3­5 Ketamine can affect various
organ systems, such as the cardiovascular,
respiratory, and central nervous systems.6,7
This drug causes side effects, which include
arrhythmia, hypertension, apnoea, airway
obstruction, and respiratory depression.6
Since the 1980s, ketamine has become a
commonly used recreational drug, especially
among young people.8 A variety of symp-
toms can be present in ketamine abusers,
such as impaired consciousness, dizziness,
abdominal pain, and lower urinary tract
symptoms. Additionally, deaths that
resulted from ketamine abuse have been
reported.8­10
In 2007, ketamine-associated cystitis
(KAC) was first described by Shahani
et al.11 They treated nine patients, and all
of them had a history of ketamine abuse
with severe dysuria, increased frequency and
urgency of urination, and gross haematuria.
Thickening of the bladder wall, low bladder
capacity, and negative urine bacterial cul-
tures were found in all of the patients, as well
as cystoscopy-confirmed cystitis. Since this
time, a few more case reports on KAC have
emerged.12­15 The use of ketamine as a
recreational drug has markedly increased
in China in the recent decade,16 and an
increasing number of patients with KAC
have visited our centre. Because KAC is a
new disorder, treatment of KAC in a rela-
tively large number of patients has not been
reported. We present our experience of
treatment of 36 patients with KAC using
botulinum toxin type A injection along with
bladder hydrodistention.
Patients and methods
Patients
For this prospective study, a total of 36
patients (30 males and 6 females, aged 19­38
years) with KAC were recruited at our
centre from 2010 to 2014. All of the patients
had a history of ketamine abuse ranging
from 1 to 5 years. Prior to admission at our
centre, they had been treated in out-
patient clinics with a muscarinic receptor
blocker and/or antibiotics, but without
symptomatic relief. The research protocol
was approved by the Medical Research
Committee, the Affiliated Zhongshan
Hospital of Guangzhou University of
Chinese Medicine (approval number:
ZSZY-LLK-030). Informed written consent
was obtained from all of the patients.
Laboratory tests and other examinations
Blood and urine biochemical tests, and urine
bacterial culture were performed in our
diagnostic laboratory. Ultrasonography
and urodynamic testing were carried out to
examine bladder structure and function.
Treatment and outcome assessment
A cystoscope was advanced into the bladder
under subarachnoid and epidural anaesthe-
sia. A volume of 20 mL of botulinum toxin
type A (200 IU in 20 mL saline) was injected
into the bladder wall through a cystoscopic
injection needle (40 points in the wall were
selected and each point received 0.5 mL
botulinum toxin type A). The bladder was
then distended by filling it with saline under
Zeng et al. 793
a pressure of 80 cm, which was maintained
for 5 min while the bladder capacity was
maintained at 150­200 mL. The saline was
then drained, the cystoscope was with-
drawn, and a urinary catheter was placed
for 3 days. Those with a positive urine
bacterial culture were administered cefurox-
ime (1500 mg/daily) for 7 days.
The O'Leary­Sant interstitial cystitis
symptom index (ICSI) and problem index
(ICPI) were used to evaluate baseline values
and improvement in patients. Urodynamic
testing results were compared before and
after treatment.
Statistical analysis
All data are expressed as mean Æ standard
deviation. Comparison of data before and
after treatment was performed using the
paired Student's t test. P < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
The demographics and clinical characteris-
tics of patients at the time of admission are
shown in Table 1. The disease duration
ranged from 6­24 months. All of the
patients ceased ketamine during the entire
study period. At admission, an ultrasono-
graphic examination showed that the major
pathological changes included an abnormal
bladder shape, low bladder capacity, and
bladder wall thickening. Cystoscopy showed
mild hyperaemia or erythematous patches in
the bladder. Urodynamic testing showed
overactivity of detrusor smooth muscle and
reduced bladder adaptability.
Positive urine bacterial culture in two
patients turned sterile after treatment with
cefuroxime. Elevated blood alanine amino-
transferase and aspartate aminotransferase
levels in four of five patients decreased to
within the normal range after hepatoprotec-
tive treatment. Haematuria in all three
patients and suprapubic pain in eight of 11
patients disappeared 1 month post-botuli-
num toxin A injection and bladder hydro-
distention. Three patients still had
suprapubic pain, but it was greatly reduced.
Other major symptoms, (e.g., increased fre-
quency and urgency of urination, and urin-
ary incontinence) were markedly relieved as
reflected by significant improvement in base-
line parameters, and the O'Leary­Sant
interstitial cystitis symptom index and prob-
lem index (Table 2).
Discussion
Ketamine abuse is more often seen in young
than in older people, which is consistent
with the fact that we treated young people
(mean age of 26 years). The mechanism by
which ketamine induces cystitis is unclear.
High levels of ketamine metabolites (e.g.,
norketamine and hydroxynorketamine) are
detected in urine from individuals with
ketamine abuse,17 suggesting that these
active metabolites might be responsible for
irritation and inflammation of the bladder.
In this study, we were unable to measure
urine ketamine metabolites because of a lack
of appropriate instruments.
Experience in the treatment of KAC is
sparse. Shahani showed that cessation of

ketamine with the addition of pentosan
polysulfate appeared to provide some symp-
tomatic relief.11 Cessation of ketamine plus
antibiotic treatment leading to resolved
lower urinary tract symptoms has also
been reported in a case of KAC.14 In
contrast, in a case report, Chiew et al.13
showed that treatment with pentosan poly-
sulfate, antihistamine, and corticosteroid
did not result in any clinical response. This
discrepancy between reports probably
reflects the fact that KAC responds differ-
entially to ketamine cessation and pharma-
cological therapy at different stages. In the
early stage, but not the later stage of disease,
ketamine cessation together with other
medications may resolve lower urinary
tract symptoms.13 In our series, the disease
duration ranged from 6­24 months, and all
patients had taken a muscarinic receptor
blocker and/or antibiotics, but there was no
symptomatic relief. Therefore, injection of
botulinum toxin type A and bladder hydro-
distention were applied to treat the patients.
Botulinum toxin type A has been used in a
dose range of 100­250 IU for treatment of
refractory interstitial cystitis.18­20 A dose of
100 IU botulinum toxin type A is used in
most cases. However, Manning et al.18
reported that 200 IU abobotulinum A did
not lead to improvement in some patients,
and they then increased the dose to 500 IU
(equivalent to 200­250 IU botulinum toxin
type A). Therefore, because of possible
inefficacy at a dose of 100 IU, we selected a
dose of 200 IU for KAC treatment. This
dose resulted in significant relief of symp-
toms, and marked improvement in baseline
parameters, and ICSI and ICPI scores.
Botulinum toxin type A inhibits vesicular
release of excitatory neurotransmitters and
neuropeptides, such as acetylcholine, nor-
epinephrine, and adenosine triphosphate,
thus reducing detrusor smooth muscle over-
activity.21 Additionally, botulinum toxin
type A has anti-nociceptive effects on blad-
der hypersensitivity.22 Despite these find-
ings, the effectiveness of botulinum toxin
type A in the treatment of refractory inter-
stitial cystitis remains controversial.18­20 In
a multicentre, prospective, randomised,
double-blind study, Manning et al.18
reported that treatment with a new botu-
linum toxin type A formulation, abobotuli-
num A, did not lead to overall improvement
in total O'Leary­Sant scores. Similarly, Lee
et al.19 showed that botulinum toxin A
injections did not benefit patients with
ulcer-type interstitial cystitis. In contrast,
more recently, Akiyama et al.20 demon-
strated that botulinum toxin A injections
were effective in the treatment of refractory
interstitial cystitis. However, they did not
characterize interstitial cystitis. The reason
for this disparity in outcomes between
studies is probably that different types of

interstitial cystitis respond differentially to
botulinum toxin A.
Hydrodistention, performed alone or
combined with other therapeutic strategies,
is effective in the treatment of interstitial
cystitis.23­26 To date, there is no standard
technical protocol for hydrodistention. The
American Urological Association suggests
that when hydrodistention is carried out for
therapeutic purposes, it must be performed
at a low pressure (60­80 cm H2
O) and for
less than 10 min.27 This guideline was fol-
lowed in this study and hydrodistention was
performed at a pressure of 80 cm H2
O for
5 min. Recently, Kuo and Chancellor25 used
botulinum toxin type A injection followed
by hydrodistention, similar to our strategy,
for treatment of patients with refractory
interstitial cystitis. They showed that this
combination method produced significantly
better clinical results than hydrodistention
alone.25 Wu et al.28 recently suggested dif-
ferent therapeutic strategies for patients
with KAC at different clinical stages. They
classified patients into three stages (I­III)
according to the severity of the disease, the
dose, and the duration of ketamine abuse.
While pharmacotherapy and bladder hydro-
distention were suitable for patients at stages
I­II, surgical intervention was proposed for
patients at stage III who had multiorgan
dysfunction, the longest history, and the
highest dose of ketamine abuse. The authors
performed surgical intervention in six
patients at stage III and improvement was
observed in all treated subjects. However,
surgical intervention as an effective thera-
peutic option for advanced KAC still needs
to be validated in larger series.
Conclusion
Thirty-six patients with KAC refractory to
conservative pharmacotherapy were effect-
ively treated with botulinum toxin A injec-
tion along with bladder hydrodistention.
These findings are important because
experience of treatment for KAC in a rela-
tively large number of patients is still lacking.
Because of loss to follow-up, we were unable
to provide long-term follow-up results, which
is a major limitation of the study. Therefore,
long-term follow -up is warranted in future
studies. Another limitation of our study is
that this was single-centre experience.
