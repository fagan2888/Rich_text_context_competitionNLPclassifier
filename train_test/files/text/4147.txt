Does Rapid and Sustained Economic Growth
Lead to Convergence in Health Resources:
The Case of China From 1980 to 2010

Abstract
China's rapid and sustained economic growth offers an opportunity to ask whether the advantages of growth diffuse throughout
an economy, or remain localized in areas where the growth has been the greatest. A critical policy area in China has been the
health system, and health inequality has become an issue that has led the government to broaden national health insurance
programs. This study investigates whether health system resources and performance have converged over the past 30 years
across China's 31 provinces. To examine geographic variation of health system resources and performance at the provincial
level, we measure the degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence in indicators of health system resources (structure),
health services utilization (process), and outcome. All data are from officially published sources: the China Health Statistics Year
Book and the China Statistics Year Book. Sigma convergence is found for resource indicators, whereas it is not observed for
either process or outcome indicators, indicating that disparities only narrowed in health system resources. Beta convergence
is found in most indicators, except for 2 procedure indicators, reflecting that provinces with poorer resources were catching
up. Convergence found in this study probably reflects the mixed outcome of government input, and market forces. Thus,
left alone, the equitable distribution of health care resources may not occur naturally during a period of economic growth.
Governmental and societal efforts are needed to reduce geographic health variation and promote health equity.

Introduction
In the last 30 years, China experienced high economic
growth accompanied by a transition to a more market-
oriented economy. The health system of China is also con-
verting from a centrally planned health system to one that is
more market oriented.1 These transitions have resulted in an
expanded supply of high-quality hospital services, especially
to the people in large cities. Unfortunately, the majority of
people in rural and poor areas are still having difficulties
accessing good-quality and affordable health care.2 Health
inequality has become a major issue in the health system of
China, which raises concerns among the general public and
the government.3 In China, health inequality at the individual
level is reflected in health disparities between rural and urban
areas and variation among provinces. The health disparity
between urban and rural areas has been decreasing, but still
exists.4 Geographic health variation is also dramatic, but less
studied. In 2005, Shanghai, the most affluent city in China,
enjoyed 78 years' life expectancy at birth, which was the
highest in China. However, the life expectancy at birth in the
poorest province in Western China was only 65 years.5 The
extent of diffusion of the advantages of growth throughout
the economy has not been rigorously studied. Our hypothesis
is that over the 30 years'economic growth, geographic varia-
tion in health system resources and performance at the pro-
vincial level has decreased and is achieving convergence.
The alternative hypothesis is that over the 30 years' eco-
nomic growth, health resources and performance at the pro-
vincial level have increased, resulting in divergence.
Geographic variation in health is caused by multiple fac-
tors, such as the upstream unequal social determinants and
the relationship between government and market in the
health system. The health system itself also plays an inde-
pendent and important role. The first question we will

explore is the current extent of geographic variation in health
system resources and performance. The next is how it has
changed during the past 30 years in the face of the rapid,
sustained economic growth.
Geographic variation in health system resources and per-
formance can be analyzed with several methods. Small area
variation studies have been widely used, especially with
comparisons of health care expenditures (HCEs) in different
regions; for example, the Dartmouth Atlas points out varia-
tions of expenditures as possible explanations of high health
costs. The Dartmouth researchers have also presented simu-
lations that suggest that the cost savings would be huge if
high-cost regions could, somehow, reduce their costs to those
of low-cost regions.6 Convergence analysis is another
method to study geographic variation. Convergence analysis
does not focus on the difference between specific areas, but
looks at the time trend of variation reduction in HCEs, or
other health indicators. Triggered by the seminal articles by
Barro and Sala-i-Martin and Mankiw etal, a huge amount of
convergence literature emerged in various contexts, mainly
to study patterns of economic growth across different
regional economies.7-9 Health economists have also adopted
convergence analysis to measure health variation within and
between regions. The convergence of HCEs has been studied
in the European Union and the United States.10-14
Limited publications have explored geographical variation
in China at the provincial level or small-area level. Chou and
Wang examined regional health expenditure inequality by
testing 2 hypotheses on HCE convergence from 1978 to
2004.15 According to their research, no single nationwide
convergence was observed, but convergence in regional clus-
ters was found. However, very few studies to date have looked
at the geographic health variation longitudinally. We sus-
pected that it may be related to the accessibility of geographic
health data either at the provincial or small-area level.
In addition, quality of health services in China was rarely
assessed according to Donabedian's typology of structure, pro-
cess, and outcome, partly because of insufficient data on the
process and outcome measures of health services.16
Donabedian's typology has been widely used as a conceptual
model for constructing indicator systems to assess the quality of
care at the individual level as well as the performance of a health
care system. We believe that the Donabedian way of categoriz-
ing health system performance is meaningful and useful from a
policy perspective, and our study will apply convergence analy-
sis to each category of health system performance to study the
variation of China's health care at the provincial level.
Methods
Sigma Convergence
The theory of welfare maximization under the usual condi-
tion of diminishing marginal product suggests that health
resources at the margin should be allocated to those areas
that are least well-off for aggregate welfare to be maximized.
In other words, if health inequality within a country were to
diminish, health indicators would converge with time and
aggregate social welfare would be maximized.
One of simplest methods for estimating convergence is to
calculate sigma convergence. Sigma is the standard devia-
tion of the log transformed value of a variable. Therefore,
sigma convergence occurs when the value of sigma falls over
time among different provinces.
Sigma is calculated as follows:

where y
i,t
is the value of a health indicator of province i at
time t.
Beta Convergence
Beta convergence refers to a process in which poor regions
grow faster than rich ones. For instance, in our study, beta
convergence would suggest that the health care resources
and performance had improved faster in poorer provinces
than richer provinces in China. When all economies are
assumed to converge toward the same steady state regardless
of their specific features, beta convergence is said to be abso-
lute. When the steady state may depend on features specific
to each economy, beta convergence is then said to be condi-
tional. Economists have acknowledged that beta conver-
gence is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for sigma
convergence.7
In this study, the following model is used to test absolute

In this article, we first estimate the national convergence
by calculating the sigma value of 7 health indicators. For 2
structure measures, we also estimate the regional conver-
gence by categorizing China's 31 provinces into 3 regions:
Eastern China, Central China, and Western China, according
to the classification in the China Health Statistics Year Book.
The conception of Eastern China, Western China, and Central
China is both geographic and economic. Provinces in Eastern
China are the most prosperous and richest. Provinces in
Western China are generally poor. Provinces in Central
China are generally better off than their western counter-
parts. Eastern China contains 11 provinces and municipali-
ties: Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, and Hainan.
Central China contains 8 provinces: Shanxi, Jilin,
Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, and Hubei.
Western China contains 12 provinces and 1 municipality:
Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi,
Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, and Inner
Mongolia. Average levels of each indicator in the 3 regions
are calculated for comparison. Sigma convergence within
each region is also tested.
Besides, we also test both absolute and conditional beta
convergences for all 7 health indicators.
Indicators for the Performance of China's Health
System
Indicators at the provincial level are selected to measure
health system performance according to Donabedian's typol-
ogy. Seven health indicators are chosen according to the rel-
evance, precision, and accessibility of the data. The definition
and available years of data for each variable are listed in
Table 1. Structure indicators include beds per 1000 people
and physicians per 1000 people. These two structure indica-
tors reflect the direct input of resources available for the
health system. Process indicators include outpatient visits,
hospital admissions, bed occupancy rate, and average length
of stay (LOS) in hospitals, reflecting the utilization of outpa-
tient and inpatient services. Maternal mortality rate is the
single outcome indicator in our analysis. Maternal mortality
is an appropriate indicator to be included in the study because
it has been the focus of China's health services system for
many years. Other outcome measures such as infant mortal-
ity and life expectancy at birth would have been desirable to
use as well, but these data are only collected in China's
decennial census. Hence, they are excluded from the analysis
as they are only reported in 3 years during the past 30 years.
All data are collected from the China Health Statistics
Year Book and the China Statistics Year Book.17,18 We only
include data of provinces and municipalities in mainland
China, excluding data from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, the Macau Special Administrative
Region, and Taiwan. It is notable that population data at the
provincial level are based on the National Population Census
of the People's Republic of China. Thus, the per capita data
are calculated based on the actual population of long-term
residents and migrants rather than the household registration
system that excluded migrants. Thus, a large number of
migrant workers and their family members who are not reg-
istered in the local household registration system are still
counted as local residents in the population census data.
Results
Results of the sigma convergence analysis are mixed. Sigma
convergence is found for the structure indicators, but not for
either the process indicators or the outcome indicator. At the
same time, beta convergence is found in most chosen indica-
tors, except for 2 process indicators (outpatient visits and
hospital admissions).
The tested sigma value for physicians per thousand peo-
ple fell from 1982 to 2010, confirming the trend of conver-
gence of this indicator. Sigma fell sharply in the 1980s and

1990s, whereas after 2000, the falling trend is ambiguous
(see Figure 1). The falling sigma value indicates that provin-
cial mean levels of physicians per thousand people became
closer to each other from 1980s to 2000 (see Figure 2).
For beds per thousand people, no convergence is observed
in the 1980s. Weak convergence in the 1990s is found,
whereas convergence after 2003 is seen (see Figure 3).
Further study on the mean number of beds per thousand peo-
ple at the provincial level probably explains the trends
described above (see Figure 4). Average beds per thousand
people in Eastern China, Central China, and Western China
were all below 2.5 in the early 1980s. From then on, the num-
ber of beds in Eastern China increased steadily in the 1980s
and stayed almost stable in the late 1990s. However, in
Central China and Western China, bed supply increased
slightly in the 1980s and early 1990s. But from the late 1990s
to 2003, beds per thousand people in Central China and
Western China decreased. After 2003, all 3 regions experi-
enced a sharp increase in average number of beds. In other
words, the gap between Eastern China and the other 2 regions
widened from the 1980s, reducing convergence.
Provincial data for outpatient visits, hospital admissions,
bed occupancy rates, and maternal mortality rate are only
available for less than 10 years. Sigma divergence is found
for bed occupancy rates. As for average LOS in hospital, the
tested sigma value rose in 1980s, fluctuated in the 1990s, and
fell after 2000. The sigma values for the other 3 indicators
fluctuated within the past 10 years.
Sigma convergence within each region (Eastern China,
Central China, and Western China) is also tested. Different
patterns of convergence are found within different regions.
For physicians per thousand people, although nationwide
sigma convergence is found, sigma convergence is not
observed within all regions. Western China showed no sigma
convergence for physicians/1000 people during the past 28
years. In Central China, sigma convergence is only observed
after 2000. In Eastern China, sigma convergence is found
from the 1980s. These results indicate that within Central
China and Western China, variation in human resources did
not decrease along with the economic growth, but in the
Eastern China, convergence in human resources input
accompanied overall economic growth. As for beds/1000,
sigma convergence only occurred within Western China
from the 1980s to 2010. In Central China, convergence on
beds/1000 occurred from 1990, whereas in Eastern China,
sigma convergence is only observed after 2000. Such differ-
ences might be due to unequal input of structure resources.
Beta convergence has been found in most chosen indica-
tors, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions (see
Table 2). The estimated beta values indicate the speed of
convergence. In general, process and outcome indicators
converged much faster than structure indicators. Without

adjusting for GDP per capita and provincial population, bed
occupancy rates converged at a rate of 7.5% yearly, average
LOS in hospitals converged at a rate of 3.9% yearly, maternal
mortality rate converged at a rate of 4.9% yearly, and beds
per 1000 people and physicians per 1000 people only con-
verged at a rate of 1.1% and 1.7% each year, respectively.
Discussion
All provinces in China have experienced striking monotonic
economic growth over the past 30 years. However, sustained
economic growth does not necessarily have equal impact on the
structure, process, and outcome of the health system. Sigma
convergence is found for resources across the provinces of
China during the long study period, but consistent results are not
observed for indicators of process and outcome. At the same
time, beta convergence is observed in 5 out of 7 health indica-
tors, except for outpatient visits and hospital admissions.
In our study, sigma convergence is found in 2 structure
indicators, physicians/1000 and beds/1000, implying the nar-
rowing gap of resource distribution. Such results are consis-
tent with studies that used Lorenz curve, Gini coefficient,
and the Theil index to describe the geographic distribution of
health resources in China.19 Convergence could emerge
when provinces with lower per capita resources caught up
with provinces with higher per capita resources, or when
provinces with higher per capita resources declined to the
level of provinces with lower per capita resources. The tested
beta convergence in structure indicators suggests that prov-
inces with lower per capita resources and worse performance
were catching up.
The underlying drivers of resource distribution in China
during the past 30 years are both market forces and govern-
ment power. In China, health care is mainly financed by
government investment, public health insurances, and out-
of-pocket fees. The majority of government investments are
from local government, rather than central government. The
scale of resource input largely depends on local economic
conditions.20 Public health insurance funds are also local-
ized. However, provinces in China have had unequal eco-
nomic development since 1980s, resulting in an uneven
local financial capacity to pay for health services. For the
indicator of beds/1000, the trends of sigma divergence in
1980s and 1990s could probably be explained by the imbal-
anced economic development among provinces. However,
the obvious sigma convergence after 2000 probably repre-
sented the input from central government. The 2000 World
Health Organization report on health system performance
and the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis
pushed the central government to allocate resources toward
public health services and health equity issues. Since then,
the central government has expanded resource input dra-
matically to less developed areas in Central China and
Western China to build and expand primary hospitals and
public health facilities.21 Such enormous investment from
central government and local government might contribute
to the sigma convergence of structure indicators as well as
beta convergence in procedure and outcome indicators in
recent years. For instance, China's New Cooperative
Medical Scheme, a large government subsidized health
insurance plan, has improved finances of township health
centers since the start of its pilot program in 2003.22
Moreover, in 2009, the Chinese government implemented
an ambitious health reform that is aimed to build up basic
health services system for all.23 The success of these re-dis-
tributive measures on physicians per capita seems be more
ambiguous than measured focused on beds.
The absence of constant sigma convergence in process and
outcome indicators is probably the result of multiple factors.
First, determinants outside the health system could influence
the process and outcome indicators differently. Although the
outcome indicator, maternal mortality rate, is very sensitive to
health services performance, it is also influenced by many
social and cultural factors.24 Second, even if the gap in struc-
ture indicators was narrowed, changes in the process and out-
come variables would lag and may take years to observe. And
last but not least, the data availability has limited our ability
to evaluate the convergence in process and outcome mea-
sures. It is notable that the absence of constant sigma conver-
gence does not contradict the tested beta convergence, as beta
convergence is not a sufficient condition for sigma conver-
gence, which directly reflected the narrowed disparities.
Although our data are collected from officially published
sources, the accuracy of the data at the provincial level is

probably imperfect. One concern for the accuracy of aggre-
gate data is patient mobility. In China, some people travel to
seek better health care in other provinces. These people are
not counted in the population data, as they are not local resi-
dents. However, these people usually only seek specialty
care in tertiary hospitals, and thus should have little impact
on the overall health indicators. Second, data for most pro-
cess and outcome indicators are only available for less than
10 years, so it is difficult to determine the trend of sigma
convergence during the relatively short period of time. In
addition, we are aware that most health indicators in this
article reflect the quantity of health resources and health ser-
vice utilization, rather than the quality of care. However,
available data for outcome measures are scarce. If longitudi-
nal data at the provincial level are available, many broader
outcome measures, such as all-cause mortality and cause-
specific mortality, should be interesting to study in the future.
Conclusions
Concerning health inequality in China, geographic variation
of health system performance is examined at the provincial
level. The degree of sigma convergence and beta convergence
is measured for indicators of structure, process, and outcome
of the health system. Sigma convergence is found in resource
indicators like the number of physicians per thousand people,
whereas it is not observed in process and outcome indicators.
Beta convergence is found in most indicators, except for 2 pro-
cedure indicators. Thus, over the 30 years of economic growth,
not all health indicators have achieved convergence, and when
sigma convergence did occur in structure indicators, it is still
uncertain whether real equity has been achieved. It represents
a call for more central government resources allocated to
resource-poor areas, and more efforts to promote health equity
in the society, to possibly translating economic benefits into
more equitable distribution of health care resources.
