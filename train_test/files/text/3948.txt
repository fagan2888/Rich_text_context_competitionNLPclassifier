Article
The goals of this article are to lay out a theory of cultural
models and use methods specific to this theory to describe
and analyze a cultural model of romantic love in America.
The first half of the article focuses on a theory of "cultural
models" and the methods used to elicit data for constructing
such a model of romantic love. The second half uses two
extended cases to illustrate how this model works in every-
day life and how predictive it is of participants' assessments
of their romantic love relationship as well as to shed light on
the decisions they make and actions they take. Taken as a
whole, both sections provide a road map for conducting cul-
tural models research. There are other road maps, but we
show how theory and methods can be linked to culture and
psychology in an explicit way for investigating cultural mod-
els and how humans use them for purposive behaviors. We
are aware of the fact that there are likely to be ethnic, gender,
age, and class differences as well as cross-cultural differ-
ences that are missed in this research; however, our aim is to
highlight what we suspect may be prototypical features of
American conceptualizations of romantic love.
We need to add that this study is an attempt to capture the
core generic features of a cultural model of romantic love. We
think we have done this; however, there may well be variants
or alternative models of love relationships that also exist. We
doubt that there is a one-size-fits-all cultural model of roman-
tic love that fits all people equally well. To assert that we
describe a cultural model of romantic love does not mean (a)
that there are not other competing models, (b) nor that people
who share this model share it in the same way. As the "love
styles" literature that we will discuss shows, many people
prefer other styles of love besides romantic; thus, companion-
ate sorts of love or some mix of various styles are also found

Romantic Love in the United States:
Applying Cultural Models Theory
and Methods
Victor C. de Munck1,2 and David B. Kronenfeld3
Abstract
We seek to advance cultural models theory by contributing to issues related to theory, methods, and testing the external
validity of a cultural model. We propose that cultural models are learned as if they were truly properties of collectivities but
have no primary existence except in individual representations of them. The shared aspect of cultural models also implies
collective awareness of the if­then entailments of cultural models. We use inductive ethnographic methods of freelisting
(n = 80) and pile sorting (n = 39) to derive a cultural model of romantic love in the United States. From these tasks, we
developed a cultural model of successful romantic love consisting of normative scenarios. For successful romantic love
relations, a person would feel excited about meeting their beloved; make passionate and intimate love as opposed to only
physical love; feel comfortable with the beloved, behaving in a companionable, friendly way with one's partner; listen to the
other's concerns, offering to help out in various ways if necessary; and, all the while, keeping a mental ledger of the degree
to which altruism and passion are mutual. Our model is supported through an examination of two extended case studies.
Further research is required, of course, but we believe we have a rather novel and dynamic cultural model that is falsifiable
and predictive of successful love relationships. The model is unique in that it combines passion with comfort and friendship
as properties of romantic love.

in the United States and elsewhere. Nevertheless, we think we
are on safe ground in presuming that romantic love is the
most prototypical and privileged style of love when speaking
of courtship. Just as people who identify themselves as
Christians will vary in faith and practice, so people will vary
in their belief in romantic love and practices associated with
it. Cultural models are generic mental models that are cultural
because we assume others share them as well.
A major contribution of our work is the use of two
extended case studies to pilot test how our cultural model
works in practice, thus conceptually moving ethnographic
"thick description" from its traditional exploratory or
descriptive function (see Babbie, 2010; Gatewood, 2012) to
an explanatory function. Our article extends the science in
social science to ethnography rather than limiting it to statis-
tics because a primary goal of social science should be to
explain human behavior in situ. The case studies were cho-
sen prior to the analysis, and--while not random--they were
not chosen with any particular bias.
Literature Review--Romantic Love
As would be expected, the psychological literature on roman-
tic love has been focused on survey-based data that explore
styles of love and more recently expanded to include various
stories of love (Sternberg, 2006, 2008). Using factor analysis,
Sternberg developed a triadic theory in which love is com-
prised of intimacy, passion, and commitment. John Alan Lee
developed a "color theory of love" in which varieties (or
hues) of love are comprised of a set of primary styles that mix
together to form a potentially infinite number of "love styles"
(Lee's phrase). However, there were six main love styles--
agape, mania, ludus, storge, eros, and pragma. These styles
have generated much survey-based research, particularly by
the foremost adopters of his theory, Clyde Hendrick and
Susan Hendrick (1986, 1988, 2002, 2006).
Style theories of love are functional, social-psychological
theories by which individuals and couples can be classified into
some set of love styles by virtue of how much they possess of
each salient attribute of that love style. It is unfortunate, how-
ever, that style theories tend to identify individuals with singu-
lar, all or nothing styles, while recognizing that individuals, in
fact, have admixtures of those styles present in their love "pro-
file" and that these proportions may change in terms of context
or partner. The Hendricks and Hendrick (2006) wrote,
The "amount" of each love style that an individual manifests can
literally be plotted on a graph. The shape of the profile, its
change over time, and its relationship to other variables become
potential empirical questions to be answered by research guided
by hypotheses. To date, our research has not dealt with profiles
per se, but with each of the six dimensions individually. (p. 151)
We admire the work of the Hendricks and suggest that cul-
tural models theory helps advance the bounded delineations
of love types inherent in a "styles"-based theory of love.
The evolutionary psychological paradigm on romantic
love has become quite popular thanks to David Buss and
Helen Fisher, whose works have been on nonfiction best-
seller lists. Recently, this approach has come under some
criticism (see Hrdy, 2011; Ryan & Jethá, 2010) primarily
because of its questionable assumptions and its selective,
often misguided, use of ethnographic material to reflect back
on the sexual mores of Paleolithic foragers. Evolutionary
psychologists have developed a field for the study of roman-
tic love that can be divided into three components. The first
is that of evolutionarily adapted mental modules that dispose
predictable sorts of mate selection, satisfaction, and retention
strategies (e.g., Buss, 2003, 2006; Kendrick, 2006a, 2006b).
The second, highlighted by the work of Helen Fisher and her
colleagues, is how these universal expressions of sex, attach-
ment, and intimacy are promoted by the human neural and
hormonal systems. As a result, Fisher asserts that love (as the
overarching term for the articulation of sex, attachment, and
intimacy) is a "drive," like hunger and thirst, and not an emo-
tion (H. Fisher, 1992, 1995, 2004, 2006; H. E. Fisher, Aron,
Mashek, Li, & Brown, 2002). The third research area derived
from the biobehavioral approach is in cross-cultural research
as reflected in the works of Jankowiak and Fischer (1992);
Jankowiak and Paladino (2008); Jankowiak (1995, 2008);
Buss (2003); Schmitt (2005, 2006); Hewlett and Hewlett
(2008); de Munck and Korotayev (1999, 2007); and de
Munck et al. (de Munck, Korotayev, & Khaltourina, 2009; de
Munck, Korotayev, Khaltourina, & de Munck, 2010). These
researchers want to demonstrate that romantic love is a cul-
tural universal or examine various corollaries that follow as
a result. Much of this work relies on primary ethnographic
and survey data while others on cross-cultural databases such
as the Human Relations Area Files (eHRAF). While our
research concerns one culture only, we note that single cul-
tural studies with an eye toward universal features of love are
not at all uncommon. Since the late 1990s, there has been a
veritable cottage industry of studies on romantic love in cul-
tural anthropology. Most of this has been spurred by gender
studies, interest in globalization, and as an extension of more
traditional anthropological interests in marriage practices
and norms. Research on romantic love in cultural anthropol-
ogy has been mostly ethnographic and qualitative rather than
theory and survey driven. In this cultural and nonevolution-
ary frame, some representative cultural anthropologists'
writing on romantic love, sex, and marriage are LauraAhearn
(2001), Jennifer Hirsch (2000, 2003), Naomi Quinn (1987,
1992, 1996, 2005), L. A. Rebhurn (1994, 1999), and Dorothy
Holland 1987 (with Skinner) and 1990 (with Eisenhart).
What makes these researchers representative of writings on
these subjects in cultural anthropology are (a) their focus on
ethnography written from a reflexive point of view (i.e., the
author is a subject in the ethnography; (b) obtaining data via
interviews and conversations or directed dialogues with their
informants; (c) favoring a grounded theoretical approach
that derives cultural constructs, motivations, ideologies, and
practices from discourse or textual analysis; (d) the
de Munck and Kronenfeld 3
multisited or multimode nature of their work; (e) an attention
to applied considerations particularly in terms of HIV/AIDS
and social justice; (f) the concern with constructions of gen-
der and modernity as shaping conceptions of intimacy, sex,
and the self vis-à-vis one's spouse or partner; and (g) chang-
ing patterns of love, sex, and marriage as a result of modern-
ization, migration, and globalization. These works are
situated in a contemporary context that is attentive to agency,
contingency, macrostructural forces, and emotion as cultur-
ally constructed (Lutz, 1988).
Barry Hewlett and Bonnie Hewlett (2008) and William
Jankowiak (2008) were among the few researchers in cul-
tural anthropology who bridged what seems to be a theoreti-
cal and methodological divide between psychologists and
cultural anthropologists in the study of romantic love. Their
work combines a comparative theoretical approach with both
ethnographic and survey methods to evaluate their hypothe-
ses or research questions. It is within the spirit of these
researchers' approach to the study of romantic love that our
project is situated. That is our goal is to propose a theoretical
and methodological approach that can be adapted to ethno-
graphic (local, contextualized) and ethnological (cross-cul-
tural, universalist) research goals. Jankowiak, Shen, Yao,
Wang, and Volsche (2015) have very recently conducted
research among urban youths in China directly using ques-
tionnaire criteria designed to test de Munck et al.'s (2009)
proposed universal criteria of romantic love. Their factor
analysis of the questionnaire results substantiated four of the
five criteria that are found in the model tested here--that is,
altruism, intrusive thinking, emotional fulfillment, and psy-
chological betterment. The fifth sexual attraction or passion
was not tested but found to be present among urban youth
(Jankowiak et al., 2015). We, therefore, assume that these
criteria will also be found (among others) as constituting a
cultural model of romantic love in America.
Literature Review--Cultural Models
Theory
The concept of cultural models was first introduced in
Holland and Quinn's (1987) introduction to an edited vol-
ume titled Cultural Models in Language and Thought. They
wrote,
Cultural models are presupposed, taken-for-granted models of
the world that are widely shared (although not necessarily to the
exclusion of others, alternative models) by the members of a
society and that play an enormous role in their understanding of
that world and their behavior in it. (Holland & Quinn, 1987,
p. 4, emphasis in original)
In the same volume, Roy D'Andrade elaborated by empha-
sizing that "A cultural model is a cognitive schema that is
intersubjectively shared by a social group" (Holland &
Quinn, 1987, p. 112). The intersubjectively shared and "taken
for granted" aspects of cultural models are central to
understanding their function. We assume, as an "objective
fact," that the relevant others of our social group also have
and use the same cultural models. As a consequence, we can
anticipate their behaviors and presume they are able to ade-
quately "read" our behaviors. The "taken for granted" notion
also presumes that the cultural model operates out of our
awareness, effortlessly and in a "chunked" manner. For
instance, when recounting a baseball game and one states
that "Jeter hit a home run," we do not need to unpack all that
is left unsaid (i.e., the ball, bat, stadium, "Jeter," or the flight
of the ball, etc.).
D'Andrade and Strauss (1992) advanced the idea of cul-
tural models as models that "instigate" or motivate behav-
iors. Thus, romantic love can motivate lower level behaviors
such as calling someone up, going on dates, declaring sexual
exclusivity and commitment, and so on. Strauss (1992) used
the idea of personal semantic models to show how cultural
models are personalized and have variable motivational
force depending on the life histories of individuals. Her main
case study was of a man who saw his role as "breadwinner"
as a basic role requirement of fathers and husbands, but who
more strongly identified with his own role as a marathon run-
ner. The cultural model theorists mentioned above show that
cultural models are not independent of each other but form a
network of models with varying degrees of motivational and
personal salience depending on individual life history and
personality.
Our theoretical orientation and goals are quite similar to
that pioneered by Quinn in her research on marriage, Strauss
on her research of the working class, and Holland and
Skinner (1987) and Eisenhart (1990). These researchers use
the concept of cultural model (or schema) to describe emo-
tions, thoughts, and actions as they occur in everyday life.
The difference is that these authors predominantly rely on
interview material; we, in contrast, seek to first develop our
cultural model of romantic love from a variety of systematic
methods pioneered by Romney and his colleagues. Two of
the main methods described by Weller and Romney (1988)
are freelisting and pile sorting. These methods tend not to be
adopted by the above researchers. We have synthesized these
two approaches by adopting the freelist and pile sorting
methods to develop our cultural model of romantic love and
interview data to show how they may work to guide and
interpret behaviors in everyday love relationships.
Dealing With Contingency in Cultural
Model Theory
A cultural model that people use must include some range of
responses to contingencies so that people will be able to
anticipate and maneuver (i.e., survive) in other than the usual
contexts. Without such contingencies, the model will have
no resilience or situated potential. The cultural model has to
contain shared, systematic information on what is expected
when the default model cannot be followed.
4 SAGE Open
In our discussion below, progressing to and including the
case materials, we tackle the issue of cultural models and
contingency by moving from thin (abstracted) to thick (con-
textualized) data. The thin data are used to develop a cultural
model of romantic love while the thick data are used to deter-
mine whether informants use our model, how they instantiate
it in their reasoning and behaviors, and to discover how they
improvise when the cultural model is not realized or cannot
be fully applied.
Examining Freelist Data
In deciding on our sample, we wanted only people who were
presently or recently engaged in a romantic love relationship.
For the case studies, we only recruited informants who were
presently in a romantic love relationship (and not of the "affair"
variety). In total, 40 Americans from a small rural town in
upstate New York, and 40 from New York City were asked to
respond to the freelist question, "What do you associate with
romantic love?" The respondents were between 20 and 50
years of age; 44 were females and 36 were males. Our sample
was obtained "on the fly" by recruiting individuals at various
public settings--laundromats, parks, on campus, bus stations,
and the like.All informants were offered US$10 for their labor.
The first author with two research assistants went over the
freelist data and coded them as single terms or phrases when
possible. The majority had to agree (two of three) for the cod-
ing of extended texts, and texts that appeared as synonyms
(joy/joyful).There were no obvious differences in the responses
of respondents of different ages, gender, or between rural and
urban New Yorkers; consequently, freelists were combined.
The freelist terms used for analysis below include only
terms mentioned four or more times. This rather arbitrary
cutoff point is, according to Borgatti and Halgin (2011), ade-
quate for analyzing a list of terms that has some reach across
our sample and, thus, can be considered "to some extent" a
cultural domain (see Figure 1).
After finishing the freelists, we discussed the responses
with most informants to aid our understanding of what they
meant by the terms. We are confident in our interpretations;
however, we expect to conduct further studies of the key
freelist terms to enhance the validity of our interpretations.
The subsequent pile sort indicates the main semantic dimen-
sions that underlie their relationship vis-à-vis each other.
The terms fit quite well with the emphasis of different
researchers on romantic love. For instance, "being together"
and "connection" fit with criteria of romantic love proposed
by most sociologists or psychologists, particularly those who
emphasize a "Platonic model of romantic love" that Kövecses
(1987, p. 18) has identified as the "dominant metaphor" of
romantic love in the United States (see also Lindholm, 1998a,
1998b; Singer, 1987, 1994; Soble, 1990; Tennov, 1979).
"Sex" and "passion" fit with most of the definitions of roman-
tic love that acknowledge the erotic/passionate aspect of
romantic love (Sternberg, 1988, 1996, 2006, in his triangular
theory of love posits passion as one vertex; Berscheid &
Meyers, 1996; Berscheid & Regan, 2005, posit that love is a
synthesis of companionate and passionate feelings). "Mutual"
and "equality" fit with Lindholm's (1998a, 1998b) discussion
on the importance of equal status as a precipitating condition
and attribute of romantic love, as well as de Munck and
Korotayev's (1999) and de Munck et al.'s (2010) findings that
romantic love, as a criterion for marriage, is causally related
to an increase in female status and intimacy. While Sternberg
views intimacy as a second vertex, he does not reflect on an
assessment of mutuality as a necessary condition for inti-
macy. Yet, it seems to us unlikely that romantic love could
flourish as a cultural norm or even as a possibility, unless a
cultural space can be created for the couple to meet as equals
(for supporting evidence, see Du, 2002, 2008; Hewlett &
Hewlett, 2008; Lindholm, 1998a; Röttger-Rössler, 2008).
Terms such as "honest," "trust," "do anything," and "sac-
rifice" reflect that the beloved is thought to possess personal
virtues that make him or her unique and worth loving. This
fits well with the Platonic conception of romantic love as
well as Swidler's (2002, p. 111) analysis of "true love" in the
United States. It furthermore supports the main premise of
love proposed by Hegi and Bergner (2010) that "Investment
in the well-being of the other [IWB] . . . was the characteris-
tic most strongly and consistently endorsed as essential to the
four kinds of love under investigation" (p. 633).
Finally, we found that romantic love is associated with the
terms "friendship," "comfortable," and "content." These are
three attributes Jankowiak (2008) would identify with "com-
fort love" and Swidler would identify with her informants'con-
ceptualizations of love after marriage (i.e., "real love"). This

suggests that key features of what would more colloquially be
referred to as companionate love are also a subset of romantic
love, at least in the American cultural model. Berscheid and
Walster (1978), Hatfield (1988), and the Hendricks and
Hendrick (2003) have viewed companionate and romantic love
to be in an "either/or" relationship (Hendricks & Hendrick,
2006, p. 163). Recently, Hendricks and Hendrick (2006) noted
that "it is quite common for young lovers to claim that their
partner is their best friend" (p. 163). However, despite the
belated recognition of "friendship" as an aspect of romantic
love, there is no attempt to incorporate it into their love style
models of romantic love. Fehr (1988), using a freelist task, is
the only researcher, to our knowledge, who found friendship to
be a significant feature of romantic love in her Canadian sam-
ple; thus, her work supports our findings.
The implications of our model are that our model of
romantic love seems to include aspects of different love styles
such as agape, companionate love, and storge. It suggests that
delimiting love into styles does not quite capture the full
range of emotions and relational qualities that are associated
with a romantic relationship. We suggest that love styles may
better refer to tendencies that are foregrounded and back-
grounded or more prominent in a relationship. Indeed, this is
implied in much of the styles literature, especially by Lee
(1976), but it is not applied in the research on love styles. We
do think that as an individual's love relationships may vary
over time, certain features of the relationship wax or wane.
Pile Sorts: The Structure of
Romantic Love
To further explore the structural relationship between the
aspects elicited through the freelist, we took the top 44
terms (all mentioned 2 or more times) to conduct a pile sort
task in which terms are sorted in "piles" based on their
perceived similarity to one another. Recruiting methods
were the same as before; our sample consisted of 20 infor-
mants from the rural area and 19 from New York City (we
lost one pile sort form). Informants were asked to sort the
cards into two piles and to continue dividing into two piles
until they could no longer divide or were left with only two
index cards per pile. The goal of this exercise was to reveal
the semantic structure of the relationships among the
terms. An "aggregate proximity matrix" (aka agprox)--the
proportion of times terms were sorted with each other--
was produced from the pile sort data. The higher the per-
cent of times terms were sorted together, they are judged as
being similar in meaning by the sample. A multidimen-
sional scale (MDS) is produced directly from the agprox
and provides a visually readable (i.e., interpretable) repre-
sentation of the agprox matrix (see Figure 2). Terms
located closer to each other were sorted together more fre-
quently than those far away; thus, they can be interpreted
as more similar to each other in meaning than terms that
are farther away. As it is a two dimensional MDS, the
terms are organized according to two dimensions of rela-
tions that can be read along the up-down, "vertical" dimen-
sion and the left-to-right, "horizontal" dimension. The
dimensions refer to underlying semantic continua along
which the terms are located.
Multidimensional scales are intended to be interpreted in
terms of underlying continua. The horizontal dimension
seems to be graded along an evaluative, "good-bad" contin-
uum with "bad" terms along the left side (from the reader's
view) and good terms to the right. "Free" is the only "mid-
dle" term, indicating that some informants evaluated it as
"bad" and some as "good," which seems reasonable given
that some informants might perceive "freedom" as a threat to
a love relationship, while others might interpret "freedom"
as an outcome of love. For instance, Swidler's (2002) infor-
mants noted that in "true love," one is free to express one's
"true self."

The vertical dimension appears to be an energy dimension
moving from low energy terms on the top to high energy
terms on the bottom. Thus, lost, vulnerable, helpless are sim-
ilar to content, secure, not alone in that they are not high
energy feelings or qualities. Frustrated, angry, and jealous
are similar to strong, care, warm, equality in that they are
typically (though not always) mid-level energy conditions
that do not seem quite as "energetic," for instance, as the
terms below them. At the bottom of the MDS, the terms
obsessive, anxious, explosive, located on the negative side,
are similar to butterflies, passion, excited, giddy in that they
refer to high energy conditions or states.
Based on the above analyses of the freelist and pile sort
data, we constructed a general cultural model of successful
or positive romantic love. The proposed cultural model con-
sists of a "thin" set of unmarked normative scenarios that
exemplify the values, feelings, states, and attendant generic
preferred actions that either reflect or cause those feelings,
values, and states as presented in the MDS. Thus, for suc-
cessful (i.e., "good" or "happy") romantic love relations, a
person would feel excited about meeting their beloved and
making passionate intimate love, as opposed to only physical
love; and at the same time feel comfortable, behave in a com-
panionable, friendly way with one's partner, listen to the
other's concerns about her or his job, offer to help out in vari-
ous ways--while keeping a mental ledger of the degree to
which altruism and passion are mutual. This cultural model
of romantic love should be predictive of states, values, and
feelings that are associated with romantic love in the love
stories or experiences of people who hold and value this
model of romantic love. Note that this model differs from the
universal feature model of love used for cross-cultural analy-
sis in that it relies on an episodic memory to create a script.
We must emphasize that we are proposing a cultural model
of romantic love. We do not claim that everyone values or
holds this model but we do assert that it seems to be a preva-
lent and prototypical model of romantic love that accords
both with our interview data and with the social-psychologi-
cal literature on romantic love. Indeed, we think most people
know this model implicitly if not explicitly, but many people
may opt for a companionate or other type of model of love
relationship depending, among other things, on their person-
alities. Further investigation with larger samples will expli-
cate the extent to which we can more confidently generalize
our findings to a larger population. We do not think the
aspects of the cultural model described above are offered
directly by informants. Instead, they are embedded in the
individually constructed versions of culturally shared sto-
ries--stories that are the unmarked prototypic exemplars that
get extended to and then realized in individual particulars.
For example, we expect that if one is in a love relationship,
she or he will tell stories that reflect the honesty and commit-
ment of the beloved, or perhaps how commitment had been
an obstacle for a while but overcome over time. If there are
concerns about trust, these are likely to be mentioned in
stories that explain or describe why there is a lack of trust
and that will also reflect a measure of dissatisfaction with the
relationship. We would expect that a happy story of love will
most likely include one or more of the positive aspects of
love that we have found in the data from which we have
inferred our proposed cultural model.
The characteristics used by informants to describe the
model are capable of modification as a result of the dynamic
feedback loops between sets of concepts that describe or
characterize aspects of a given cultural model and individual
realizations of the model in specific concrete situations. In
the ideal scenario, these coexist without stress or disjunc-
tion--that is, the relationship is assessed as mutual, commit-
ted, and intimate, there is passion, and there is friendship.
But in people's specific instantiations of these, they often
have to deal with and assess the implications of apparently
(and stressfully) disjunctive or inconsistent attributes; this
assessment can move them to variant cultural models or can
lead them to reconceptualize the seeming inconsistencies as
something consistent. Inconsistencies come up quite a bit in
the two case studies we present, and we see how the infor-
mants deal with such inconsistencies either by modifying
their romantic love model ("maybe I'm incapable of pas-
sion") or causing some kind of ambiguity-based conflict ("is
it love or is it lust?"). In fact, it is quite possible that, similar
to Hutchins's (1995) description of navigation or Gatewood
and Lowe's (2006) account of credit unions, no one ever uses
or "sees" the whole cultural model at once, but only those
aspects that fit a particular situation or upon which someone
is reflecting.
We hypothesize that the more a member of a love dyad
assesses the dyad to fit the above model, the more satisfied
she or he is with the relationship. The less the relationship
fits the above model, the less satisfied the member who
makes that assessment and the more they will try to alter the
relationship to fit the above model, or remain dissatisfied, or
terminate the dyad. We also hypothesize that many scenar-
ios, as presented by informants, will illustrate attributes from
the cultural model we have developed. We assume that sce-
narios illustrating aspects of our cultural model will be pre-
sented as salient or go unmentioned as default scenarios that
"go without saying" whereas those scenarios that contrast
with any aspect of our cultural model will be marked and
deliberated on by the informant as somehow deviant from
their understanding and expectations of a successful roman-
tic love relationship.
A Pilot Test of Our Cultural Model
Through Two Case Studies
The two informants used for pilot testing our cultural model
are Rose, a 20-year-old student, and Darryl, a 42-year-old
electrician, construction worker, and general handyman
(these are pseudonyms). We chose these two for two reasons:
First, we have four full interviews over a span of a year for
de Munck and Kronenfeld 7
both, which have been fully coded. Second, within the con-
text of an article, we aim to provide thick descriptive data
from the interviews to show how either the given informant
uses the proposed cultural model or how we can use it to
explain her or his behavior. We did not select them a priori
because they fit our cultural model; indeed, we would be
hard-pressed to find two people who fit it in some perfect
way. People do not fit the model as much as our model can
be used to explain and predict what people think, feel, and
do. Our claim is that our informants are using as their refer-
ence standard a cultural model similar to the one we have put
forth. The fullness of treatment is required to assess the rela-
tionship of their actions and views of their actions to our pos-
ited cultural model. To add other people or to compile across
informants would be impossible, within an article format,
without losing the way a model is used during the develop-
ment of a relationship over time and across different situa-
tions and conditions.
The interviews were examined by reading through the
transcriptions and then coding and querying them for pas-
sages that reflect our proposed cultural model as well as
whatever other features appeared salient to our informants
but were not captured by our cultural model. Interviews
commonly took 1 hr, often more. The first three interviews
with each informant took place over a 2-month period and
the fourth interview was approximately 9 months after the
third interview. Both Darryl and Rose had been in serious
relationships; Darryl had married when he was 31 years old
and separated from his wife when he was 33 (officially
divorcing her when he was 40). He had a son, 9 years old, at
the time I was interviewing him. Darryl had custody of his
son--as his wife had substance-abuse problems and was in
and out of mental health centers. He worked as a landscaper
and electrician. Darryl is of European descent, intelligent,
affable, did not have a BA but was taking courses occasion-
ally with the intention of becoming a schoolteacher. He had
served in the military and was interested in the Lakota
Indians and archeology as a hobby. He was not particularly
political and referred to himself as an "Independent."
Rose was a 21-year-old student at a New England
University (not the one where the first author teaches). She
had a 24-hr-a-week job and a 3.80 grade point average
(GPA). Her parents were from Italy and apparently had an
arranged marriage. She had a steady relationship with a non-
Italian White male that lasted from high school till the end of
her senior year in college. We know nothing about her politi-
cal inclination but guess that her background is middle-of-
the-road to Democrat.
We will provide excerpts from the interviews beginning
with Rose. The interviews serve as a source of instances
and attributes for exploring the usefulness of our cultural
model of romantic love--and we are using the interviews
as a means to flesh out (i.e., provide scenarios) and focus in
on the cultural model suggested by the freelist and MDS
data. A brief assessment of the interview excerpts as they
either fit or contravene our proposed cultural model follows
each excerpt.
Case Study 1: Rose
Rose's first interview data.Rose met her boyfriend, Josh, in
the 11th grade, she says, "All my friends had boyfriends and
I was just sick of it; I mean I was a fat lonely person just by
myself." She and Josh became a couple quickly.
Rose continues,
After 1 month together he [i.e., Josh] said he was in love with
me and I thought that was just too soon, that there was no way.
And I told him, there was just no way he could know enough of
me to say "I love you" . . . We stayed together every day. . . . I
was looking for love at that moment, you know, to satisfy my
needs for that time period. Because after school I wanted to be
with someone, I didn't want to just sit at home and watch TV. . .
I wanted to be with someone. I wasn't looking for three years
down the road, two years down the road; I was just looking for
right now. Who am I going to bring to my prom? You know it
would be great to bring someone there whom I loved to bring to
the prom with me and that's what my train of thinking was of a
relationship . . .
Assessment of proposed cultural model.Here we see that
peer pressure and the social milieu of high school is a pri-
mary motivation for Rose to search for what she calls a love
relationship. This interview reflects something that was
not picked up in the freelist or pile sort data and that is the
importance of one's relevant peer group and what they are
doing to "pre-accelerate" (Manning, 2009) the process of
falling in love. Of course, this should not be surprising to us,
as romantic love is by its very nature construed as a social
relationship. We have here what is sometimes spoken of as
"social pressure" and affiliative goals, with the understand-
ing that such pressure and striving to "fit in" can be either
explicit or implicit. It should be noted that although social
pressure and the desire to fit in may be motivating factors
in themselves, they are not attributes or part of the default
romantic love model, but they can be part of alternative
(marked) and negatively valued alternative cultural model
story lines. Here, also, Rose is able to look at her behavior
both from "inside" (how she felt and thought) and "outside"
(how others expected her to be) perspectives and see how
these converged to influence her own motives and behavior.
Cultural models often include multiple roles (any of whose
fillers may be applying the model) entailing the possibility
of seeing the modeled situation from the perspective of any
of those roles. Thus, cultural models, importantly, provide
a framework for people to consider and take account of the
likely perception of their behavior by others or the effects of
their behavior on others.
In other ways, she presents scenarios and thought-feeling
complexes that fit with our cultural model: the two of them
being together every day and not wanting to be alone. She
8 SAGE Open
also indicated that her romantic model of romantic love also
contained a timeline based on the development of the rela-
tionship akin to Quinn's (1992) metaphorical model of
romantic love as a "journey" and "project."
Second interview data. This was a key interview session, and
we will provide two passages. In the interest of space and
what will be patently clear to the reader, we will keep the
analysis quite brief. The point is not to analyze as much as it
is for readers themselves to recognize how key aspects of our
proposed cultural model are expressed by and, thus, have
predictive ability and provide insight into Rose's discourse.
Excerpt 2.1
VdM:
Let's talk about your general philosophy of love
and how it fits in with your life . . . how important
love is to you.
Rose:
Sure yeah. Let's see. Uhmm . . . let me think for a
second . . . well to be in love what I would want
is . . . I want someone who is my friend who I can
talk to who cares about what my opinions are
uhmm. Someone who does treat you differently
than other people so you can tell that you are spe-
cial to him and that when you are together you
feel secure you feel that the love is present there.
Uhm . . . and it was a friendship too and uhm and
to be in love allows you to have fun with that per-
son no matter what you do it could be the stupid-
est thing and it is just fun with that person because
you get along so well . . . and I don't know . . . you
can share the most intimate like deepest thoughts
you have or anything embarrassing you know any
bad thing, you can share it with that person . . .
you have to feel comfortable with that person you
have to be able to trust them uhm you never have
to fear that when you tell them something it won't
go in one ear and out the other that they'll remem-
ber what you say you know . . . uhm . . . they
really have to care about you . . . this is all going
both ways too uhm and.
Excerpt 2.2.We had been discussing Rose's life at school
and she describes a temporary boyfriend, named George.
VdM:
How did you meet George? [She begins by dis-
cussing Josh.]
R:
We were just so emotionally attached . . . [in high
school] . . . and . . . during my first year . . . [in
college] . . . I thought he would cheat on me. I
kept saying to guys that I wouldn't break up with
anyone because of Josh and then I became inter-
ested in George and I just knew that he was so
much better for me . . . [than Josh]. I told him
about Josh but I didn't tell Josh about George. I
thought it would naturally happen that I would
get attracted to someone else. So I told Josh that I
wanted to see other people because we hadn't
been with other people. If he wasn't so honest and
so good to me [pause] I know that he would never
cheat on me . . . [referring to Josh]. He just knows
that we're going to get married . . . I am afraid
that if I do break up with him I'm not going to
find someone as good as him. . . .
VdM: And Josh, how does he fit or not fit hmmm?
R:
With Josh I'm attracted to him but for some rea-
son I can't get into the physical part of it and I
think that totally is what's wrong with our rela-
tionship right now. I am not sexually attracted to
Josh but am to George . . . that's putting it into a
slot 'cause I feel bad 'cause I want to be that way
but I can't and he needs that and I need that in a
relationship and it's okay for me right now that
it's not too physical 'cause that's not really what I
want and uhm I don't know. But for him . . . that's
part of a relationship that's what makes a rela-
tionship different from a friendship. And I think it
has to be there for you to distinguish a relation-
ship from a friendship to keep it going . . .
VdM: Is that the primary difference?
R:
That's not the complete difference but you can
. . . like I have a friend right now and we have
love for each other just because we have known
each other a really long time and we're really
good friends but it doesn't necessarily lead to a
relationship . . . maybe we could have passionate
sex but yeah I guess there has to be something
else there I don't know if I can say what it is but
there has to be something else . . .
She had sexual relations with George but not intercourse.
Finally, she broke up the relationship with George because
she told Josh who became very upset and she says,
he loves me so much and I loved him but I was hurting him . . .
[it] made me sad. . . . I just said I was sorry . . . we didn't really
talk much afterwards and then I left. I told him I never would do
it again, . . . that I was sorry that I loved him so much and I
probably knew that I was going to do it again.
Assessment of proposed cultural model.In Excerpt 2.1,
Rose is referring to attributes associated with friendship,
intimacy, in short, aspects one finds in the "good," low-mid-
level energy area of the MDS. She also introduces a linked
cultural model of the "true" self (vs. false or staged self) that
allows her to be stupid and vulnerable and, hence, intimate.
The "if-then" relationship between a true self and true love
was also emphasized by Swidler's (2002) informants. How-
ever, in Swidler's case, it was associated with love after mar-
riage when an enduring relationship had been established.
In this case, true love is, according to Swidler, contrasted
de Munck and Kronenfeld 9
with romantic love. We did not find such a contrast probably
because both Rose and Darryl were single rather than mar-
ried and were involved in the courtship rather than the settled
down phase of a relationship.
Intimacy, altruism, and mutuality--concepts we have
identified with our cultural model of romantic love--were
also expressed in Excerpt 2.1. In addition, and something not
presented in our model of romantic love but certainly not
opposed to it, is the notion of being made to feel special. The
idea of feeling special and "unique" is reflected in the com-
plex of terms in the freelist and MDS, and is perhaps a higher
order term for some complex of terms such as "commitment,
complete, intimacy, friendship," and so on. We also conjec-
ture that feeling unique is not mentioned as an aspect of
romantic love because it is not a property per se of the model
but a consequence of the model and related as the idea of a
"true self" to a cultural model of the self and, as a result, sug-
gests further avenues for research.
Excerpt 2.2 complements the first in that Rose expresses
what results when the salient aspects of the "good, high
energy" dimension of romantic love are absent. This, clearly,
is the problem in her relationship with her long-term boy-
friend, Josh. Again, we see how a concept of self is seam-
lessly intertwined with the cultural model of romantic love,
as she first considers herself at fault and is motivated to have
a relationship with George to test, in essence, if her "self" is
lacking the ability for good, high energy states and feelings
or if it is a problem of the romantic relationship itself. Our
cultural model of romantic love does not predict that she
would seek another relationship, but it is a feasible predic-
tion from our model given the absence of high energy good
feelings in her relationship with Josh. To rationalize the
absence of good, high energy feelings, she introduces a new
cultural model--that of marriage--and evaluates Josh in
light of both the romantic and marriage cultural models.
Finding him to be a strong fit with her marriage cultural
model, she decides to reconsider her developing sexual rela-
tionship with George, whom she links with romantic love.
Apparently, at that time, the cultural model for marriage hav-
ing a stronger motivating force than the one for romantic
love, she decides to break off her relationship with George
and profess fidelity to Josh. Given our theory of cultural
models, we expect such additional inputs as we do not
believe that cultural models are cognitively engaged in pure
isolation from others and that a major research thrust in the
future will have to focus on these connections, as Strauss
(1992) and Strauss and Quinn (1997) also both emphasized
when introducing connectionist theory to describe cultural
models.
Third interview data (a discussion on unprotected sex)
VdM: With Josh, did you always use a condom?
R: In the beginning we did a lot.
VdM: Condoms?
R: Yeah and just recently we tend not to.
VdM: How did that happen?
R:
I don't know, I thought, you know it would make
it more exciting, I could finally feel like I was
being swept off my feet.
VdM: Was it a big decision?
R:
I don't know I just thought about it and decided
to do it.
VdM: Was he surprised?
R: I don't know.
VdM: Did it make a difference in your relations?
R:
Well I'm just a bad person to talk to about
this 'cause we're not that sexually active that
much anymore . . . we've had unprotected sex
like 4 times . . . the last 4 times . . . and it wasn't
pleasurable . . . I could totally say stop and he
would have, but I don't. I wanted it to be pleasing
for me . . . and him.
VdM:
Have you thought of why it's not pleasing to
you?
R:
Yeah I'm like that 1% [laughs] . . . the 1% that
just can't enjoy sex.
Assessment of proposed cultural model. This excerpt shows
how cultural models must be flexible enough to deal with
contingencies.
Obviously, life is not perfect and is, as noted before, a
contingent enterprise. No cultural model ever totally or per-
fectly specifies anyone's complete behavior in any situation.
In part, this is because specific contingencies can move our
application of one or another piece of a cultural model from
its default to some marked variant. But, more basically, we
must remember that a cultural model itself only actually
specifies what is needed for its functioning. Only when the
cultural model is instantiated in some situation--that is,
when the specifics of that situation are interpreted in terms
of, and fitted to, the cultural model's parameters--does its
application acquire the added behavioral content of that situ-
ation. And then this behavioral content only acquires behav-
ioral implementation when the cultural model is realized as
the model on which each players' actions or acted-on inter-
pretations are based.
Consequently, there is never a perfect fit between cultural
model and behavior. Cultural models that "work" must be
abstract enough to deal with contingencies, yet concrete
enough to direct behavior in patterned and predictable ways
that conform to the model. By practicing unsafe sex, Rose is
attempting to fulfill the "high energy" aspect of romantic
love with Josh. She is not directly seeing her behavior in
terms of a whole cultural model of romantic love, but she is
specifying a part of her "model" that is not being satisfied.
She further brings into her "dynamic awareness" another cul-
tural model--marriage. She finds George to be a better fit for
the cultural model of marriage that she employs and, thus,
modifies or alters her cultural model of romantic love by
10 SAGE Open
blaming herself, rather than Josh, for her inability to find
passion (or good, high energy feelings) in her relationship
with Josh. This compromise allows for the possibility of
marrying Josh while not fulfilling her "holistic" cultural
model of romantic love. "Holistic" is in quotes, because she
is unable to mentally see the whole model but her actions
indicate that high energy, good feelings are important to her,
so we can reasonably conclude that the cultural model of
romantic love we have posited is one that Rose employs.
Fourth interview data (9 months after the third interview)
VdM: The world is dying to know about you and Josh.
R:
Josh and I are over; I haven't talked to him in 2
months. During the summer I was in X (note: X,
Y, and Z are names of universities) and he was in
Y; we didn't speak to each other too much and
we were just growing farther and farther apart.
Senior year came and he was in Z. We started
talking . . . once a week . . . there was nothing
there and we decided that we couldn't commit,
and we just would try to date other people, but of
course he said that he didn't, I said I wasn't but I
was and then I went to Cancun in March. When I
came back I told him I had kissed someone in
Cancun, he got really mad at me. We had talked
about trying to work things out after graduation,
because we would have more time to commit to
each other, to see if that's what we really wanted.
He got really angry with me and I said I told you
that I can't commit to you right now, I don't think
it's fair that you did. He kept saying that I was the
one for him but I said "you can't form an opinion
unless you have something to compare it to,"
because he hasn't had any other girlfriends. He
told me that he had cheated on me and had rela-
tionships with other people . . . the whole time
when he was acting like a perfect person . . . like
he had never done anything wrong . . . was
always faithful and never cheated on me.
Meanwhile, I was always the bad one trying to
tell him the truth and finally he just breaks it to
me all at once. I wasn't mad at him for cheating
on me because I would be hypocritical if I did,
cause I was doing the same thing but I was trying
to be honest about it and so it was awful. That
ended things right there.
VdM: It was awful?
R:
He was the one person I thought I could trust.
VdM: What do you mean the one person?
R:
He was the one person that stuck by me, I am not
saying that I was a great person to him but he
always stuck by me. I just thought it was uncon-
ditional and I could trust him with anything and
he would never hurt me intentionally, and he did
. . . not intentionally; but I thought for sure that
he would feel bad enough that if he did do that he
would tell me right away. I just had it all wrong.
He thought that he could get away with it.
VdM:
And you found out over the phone?
R: Yes.
Later during this interview, Rose said,
I was planning on breaking up with Josh and I almost instigated
it telling him that I kissed someone in Cancun. I am always
trying to instigate a fight so he would break up with me because
I didn't have the courage to break up with him. I was giving him
enough reasons to be like "forget it Rose." He never would do
that.
Assessment of proposed cultural model. The first author never
interviewed Josh (nor George) so we cannot make suppositions
concerning the motivations for their actions or their feelings.
Rose had built up a strong model, supported by scenarios of
trust and Josh's commitment and faithfulness to her. She had
been the "bad one" and Josh the "good one" and this had played
a significant role in her decision to break up with George and
stay with Josh and also her decision to experiment with unpro-
tected sex as a way of increasing passion and excitement. In
an earlier interview, she had discussed with her mom how her
relationship with Josh lacked passion and she was interested
in meeting other males. Rose said, "My mom knows how I
feel and she thinks I should meet other people but she thinks
I should marry him [i.e., Josh]." After the break up with Josh,
she had considered telling her parents but decided against it for
now because "My mom loves Josh, she thinks he is perfect."
This and earlier discussions on peer pressure suggest that part
of the "directive force" of a cultural model is peer and fam-
ily pressure. This is hardly surprising. However, in this case, it
reinforced Rose's own assessments of Josh as having all sorts
of personal virtues that she might not "find again." Despite this
"rose-colored" view of Josh, she was, at least by what she said,
not as angry or upset as one might expect when she found out
he had lied and cheated on her all along. Instead, she expressed
relief that the relationship ended. We suggest that had her rela-
tionship met the complete model of a successful romantic love
relationship (including, in this case, high energy aspects of
passion and excitement in life), she would probably have been
devastated by Josh's confession--and it is not likely that she
would have kissed someone when on holiday in Cancun (or if
she had, she would not have told him). Our proposed, develop-
ing cultural model of romantic love serves us well in providing
a framework and story line by which to understand and predict
Rose's motives, feelings, and actions.
Case Study 2: Darryl
At the time of the first interview, Darryl was 42; he had been
divorced for 2 years and had had full custody of his
de Munck and Kronenfeld 11
9-year-old son, Rich, since he was 2 years old. According to
Darryl, his ex-wife has substance-abuse problems and was,
consequently, in and out of both jail and mental institutions.
He made his living as an electrician, construction worker, and
general handyman in a rural area of New England. He was
devoted to his son and made a reasonable but certainly not
extravagant income. During the four interviews, we focused
on both his ex-wife and his current "girlfriend" Hannah. For
purposes of space, we will only focus on material related to
his present relationship. He, apparently, rarely saw or heard
from his ex-wife.
First interview on Darryl's philosophy of romantic love.Darryl
began by noting that when he was younger, he would pursue
any woman he had a "romantic interest in."
D:
Today I see lots of issues like caring, honesty,
trust and understanding as attributes that I would
look for and that's not to say that I couldn't meet
someone and fall in love . . . that's not what I am
saying but I think it's difficult to find out if some-
one has all those characteristics before you nec-
essarily fall in love with them . . . I mean I'm
involved with a lady now . . . I love a lot of things
about her, she's very understanding, she's very
sharing, there's a lot of compromise and every-
thing. There's a lot of things I love about her but
I don't think I am in love with her. It's kind of
hard to explain I guess. I love a lot of things about
her as a human being, there are a lot of things I
love about her . . . but I just don't feel this strong
pull inwardly. I mean I can just tell inwardly that
it's probably not what she wants it to be . . . so I
kind of . . . I told her that that I love her in a lot of
ways but I don't love her in the ways that she
expects me to . . . I am not in love with her.
Basically she has all these attributes but there's
this additional thing this feeling that I have inside
that I think has to be there which is not there.
VdM:
What is that feeling, is it something that one can
describe?
D:
I'm not sure . . . if it's biological or just me over
the years . . . that my ideas have changed, and I
am not exactly sure how to describe it. I thought
a lot . . . of the way people change. I know I
change when I get into a relationship especially
when I have abstained from a relationship for a
long time . . . which I have done . . . and suddenly
I feel more energetic, more alive . . . but there's
something more, some substance more I think it's
both physical and mental--I think there's some-
thing that goes on mentally that makes you feel
high but also physically you just feel more
empowered I guess. It makes you feel stronger as
an individual.
Assessment of proposed model. Darryl begins with terms
that imply "mutuality" and the negotiation of power and care
within a relationship: "understanding," "sharing," "compro-
mise." He observes that his cultural model has changed over
time, earlier it was more of a "ludus" type model where love
and sex were inosculated with one another. He distinguishes
between a companionate and passionate model and, like for
Rose, something is missing; but unlike for Rose, it is more
ineffable and is not necessarily "passion." As he attempts to
describe it, it begins to sound more like a sports energy drink;
it makes one high, gives one energy both physically and men-
tally. Thus, this seems to refer to a general good feeling, high
energy state that is triggered by "being together" with the
other qualities--mutuality and caring, honesty--that make
for a successful relationship but are subsequent to and not an
inherent aspect of romantic love. Yet, without these qualities,
romantic love is transitory, as reflected in his discussion of
his wife with whom he was in love but could not live with.
His romantic love model focuses on the high energy features
and a sense of personal transformation (i.e., romantic love
"makes you stronger as an individual") that occurs when one
is with the beloved. In these statements, Darryl appears to
be using a Platonic model, of the kind reflected in the work
of Irving Singer (1994), Alan Soble (1990), Charles Lind-
holm (1998a, 1998b), and Zoltán Kövecses (1987). For Dar-
ryl, romantic love is a transcendental state that you achieve.
Two individuals are less than the whole, by "achieving"
requited, mutual love, the two become a whole--the love
couple. Furthermore, when you achieve this state, you are
granted increased energy and confidence. This conception of
romantic love as a transcendental state is, it seems, virtu-
ally identical to Rose's conception, whose focus is on fix-
ing what is lacking--that is, passion. However, unlike Rose,
Darryl assesses and views his conception (or cultural model)
of romantic love in terms of its impact on what is for him
his more important role as father. Thus, when he talks about
how his ideas of romantic love have changed, he does not
directly note that these changes are not just a function of age,
but what came with his aging--a son. Like Rose, he also
feels that individuals can intentionally engineer their court-
ship relationship to fix what is lacking.
Excerpt 1.2
VdM: Can being in love be cultivated?
D:
Yeah I think it can. Like this relationship I am in
now . . . it doesn't necessarily mean I couldn't fall
in love with her tomorrow . . . but I feel there is
something missing in me . . . I think you can defi-
nitely grow into it . . . especially if you have a lot
of good feelings . . . like I said I have a lot of good
feelings towards this lady.
He had been dating Hannah, whom he referred to through all
of the first interview and most of the subsequent ones as
12 SAGE Open
"lady," for approximately 2 months at the time of the first
interview. He explains,
She was very disturbed when I said I didn't [love her] . . . she
said she just figured that I did. And I said "well you know . . . we
never discussed it" . . . well I have a son, so that kind of comes
into play too.
She said,
"how are you going to explain to your son if he asks you
questions about why I am sleeping over and why all of a sudden
is there a woman sleeping in your bed with you?" . . . He's never
known any woman that's slept in my bed . . . I mean he knows
his mother but she left when he was 2.
Assessment of proposed cultural model.Just as Rose did,
Darryl first blames himself for not being "in love" with Han-
nah: "Something is missing in me." Furthermore, like Josh,
Hannah is described as having lots of good attributes that
frequently are identified with love but they do not catalyze
Darryl to fall in love with Hannah (as not Rose with Josh).
Hanna professes to be "in love" with Darryl, but while appar-
ently motivated to reciprocate, he is unable to do so, because,
in part, of the lack of attributes identified with the "good"
feelings, high energy zone. His role as a father has an impact
on his cultural model; at least, Hannah (as he tells it) seems
to think so. She seems to create a cultural scenario where if
there is a child in the house and a woman sleeps with a man
regularly, the group is a family and by implication the father
qua husband loves his wife (as she does him). However, by
promoting this cultural model of family, she seems to have
overstepped her bounds and used the wrong strategy, for to
put herself in that position she, by implication, must also
be "like a mother" to Darryl's son. However, her actions do
seem to lead to Darryl modifying his initial causal model of
romantic love relationships. Whereas he had indicated that
"falling in love" precedes finding out about the quality of the
relationship and virtues of the beloved, he now clearly argues
that one can "grow" into love when the other person exhib-
its all those good traits (mainly low energy, positive values,
characteristics, and behaviors). It further seems that this
switch was spurred by recognizing that Hannah's scenario is
also one that his son employs since "he's never known any
woman that's slept in my bed . . ."
With confidence, we can see that both Darryl and Rose
consider romantic love not just a feeling but something that
can be intentionally cultivated and modified. For Rose, the
cultivation refers primarily to the psychological domain of
her own desire to feel passion and be engaged in a love rela-
tionship that kindles passion. For Darryl, the cultural model
of romantic love needs to be modified so it articulates with
his role as father and that he has control of the relationship.
Thus, Hannah's demands, her agency if you will, is a threat
to his autonomy in the relationship because his relationship
with his son has priority. For him, the quality that is lacking
is in a rough way a positive articulation of both relationships
in which the cultural model of the love relationship as posed
by Hannah complements rather than threatens the cultural
models that form his relationship with his son, including, as
Hannah alludes to, the dual role of lover and (step)mother to
his son.
Interview 2 (2 weeks later; the woman had been over both
weekends). Hannah was 38 years old, divorced, and without
children. Hannah's father had given her a TV and she had
asked Darryl if he wanted one and he went to pick it up when
she was not at home. That night, she phoned him. Darryl tells
the story.
D:
She said, "I just wanted to call up and report a hit
and run and the theft of a television," and she
laughed and I laughed too; and we talked.
VdM: Did it scare you?
D:
[Slight hesitation] . . . No because I knew she
was kidding. . . . So we got to talking and she
said, "well did you talk to your son?" and I said,
"I didn't tell him that we fell in love." And she
said, "well you should explain to him that you
just don't sleep with someone that there should
be love there before you do that." And I said,
"well I think you should definitely have strong
feelings." And I was . . . once again she was
throwing "love" out very swiftly and easily and
so in trying to discuss it I told her that I liked her
a lot and . . . and I liked everything about her and
I think that was the offensive thing . . . that I
wouldn't change that word "like" or "care" to
"love" and she became very upset and [when]
we ended the conversation that night she
wouldn't talk or respond to any questions or any-
thing I said; so I said, "well why don't I call you
tomorrow night?" So the next day, that night I
went home and I called her and I had thought
about it a lot during the day . . . and I told her that
I realize that I was just afraid of the word love
. . . and that my definition was not the same as
your definition . . . and before that I said, "and I
realize that I was wrong I can't say I love you, I
can say `I love your eyes,' `I love your face' and
`I love your mind' and `I love your humor' and I
can say all those things but it's still not evoking
the feeling that I think love is. And `I am sorry
that you are hurt but it was never my intention to
hurt you.'" Then I reminded her of the conversa-
tion we had when we first got together and I was
lying on one side of the bed and she was lying on
the other and you know "you said you were lone-
some" and we went through the conversation
again and she said, "well maybe it's both our
de Munck and Kronenfeld 13
fears it's my fear of being rejected, ["she didn't
say rejection but something like that," Darryl's
aside] . . . and your fear of trusting someone."
And then she said, "you can trust me." And . . .
and . . . so I explained to her, "I don't feel that
I'm in love with you, that's not saying that I
couldn't grow to love you or fall in love with you
tomorrow but I am not making that commitment
right now." And she and I . . . she still seemed to
be upset and she called me the next day and she
indicated that she was okay with it now, that it
didn't bother her and this weekend she came
over.
VdM: Did you have a good time?
D:
Yeah, I mean it seemed like . . . that it was a little
easier . . . that we both knew where we stood.
She indicated . . . she did say something this
weekend that she still wasn't sure about my not
being able to say that I was in love with her but
that she was willing to take the fact that I love all
these things about her in the meantime and hope
that it grew into something . . .
VdM: Does she love you?
D:
Yes. Well and I mean it's hard and I told her
maybe you should sleep in your bed, the other
bed, and I'll sleep in here, because, I told her, I
don't want . . . if this doesn't work out . . . I don't
want you to feel that you are just a sexual outlet
for me . . . so I mean that way, this way, maybe
we should pull apart that much at least . . . if you
are concerned about it, then let's abstain from the
sexual part of this until I . . . you know . . . until
we see what happens . . . I mean if I . . . if I'm not
going to fall in love with you and if that's going
to upset you then maybe you don't want to have
a sexual relationship with me.
VdM: What did she say.
D:
I'll think about it . . . I'll have to think about it
. . . this was during the day and by night she said
that she wanted to sleep in the same bed as me
and so . . . we had sex all night . . . [laughs] every
opportunity we had.
Assessment of proposed model. Her gift of a television is
reminiscent of the high frequency "gift" received in the freel-
ist.Also H. Fisher (1992), discussing the importance and uni-
versality of gift giving as part of the courtship process, wryly
noted that even male flies give small pieces of carcasses to
female flies as a prelude to mating. Gifts of course as Marcel
Mauss pointed out are rarely if ever "free" and usually entail
reciprocity; thus, the giver implicitly ensnares the giftee in
a web of obligations. F. G. Bailey (1971) also noted that the
German etymology of gift (gif) refers to either "gift" or "poi-
son" and suggested that this double meaning (à la Mauss)
inheres to gift giving. Hence, Hannah's remark of a "Hit
and run . . . theft," although overtly intended to be humor-
ous, covertly suggested that she and Darryl were connected
through a series of obligations and counter-obligations that
suggest in its pure sense "family" and in its poisoned sense
"obligatory service."
Furthermore, unlike Josh, and perhaps biased by the lens
of Darryl's narrative, Hannah seems to be the pursuer in this
relationship with Darryl retreating, hesitating, and demarcat-
ing his son and himself as the family group, independent of
Hannah. These separate cultural models (of family life and
obligations) serve as directive forces that impact Darryl's
cultural model of love. Both, Darryl and Hannah seem to
agree that, at their age and in Darryl's situation of an "incom-
plete prototypical family," romantic love when mutual entails
both marriage or cohabitation at the very least, and Hannah's
adopting, to some extent, the role of "mother" to Darryl's
son. If we ignore these complicating features, we ignore the
"morass of contextuality" within which cultural models are
applied, necessarily adapting to a mental environment that
involves other cultural models distributed with more or less
coherence, centrality or salience, and directive, motivational
force.
Darryl discusses how after the gift, Hannah begins to
"throw" the word "love" around very "swiftly and easily." In
his narrative of his discussion with her, he attempts to distin-
guish between like and love, noting that he loves many things
about her but is not "in love." He, like Rose, and as before,
blames himself, explaining to Hannah on the phone that he
was "just afraid of the word love." Hannah brings up their
mutual fears, she of "being alone" and "rejection," he of "trust-
ing," as, in a way, cultural models that inhibit the expression or
fulfillment of the cultural model of romantic love and family,
as she sees it. Both Darryl and Hannah see love and family (by
this meaning living together and being a family or like a fam-
ily) as joined or inosculated cultural models with the one
(love) inevitably leading to the other. He makes clear that his
feelings for her are distinct from another cultural model that is
proximate to romantic love, that of sex and particularly of
males as using women as "sexual outlets." His feelings are
more than that. He unambiguously means by this he has strong
affectionate feelings for Hannah, which can be ambiguously
interpreted as moving toward romantic love (which Darryl has
said can "grow") or just settling into a state of "companionate"
love or "like." Some of the attributes of companionate love
and liking overlap with our proposed cultural model of roman-
tic love but do not comprise it. Perhaps Hannah initiates sex
that evening (this is more conjectural) because it is a try for the
passion that is important for love--her desire for Darryl to
want and need her in his life in the way that he asserts to be
lacking. However, here there is another ambiguity at play, as
Hannah has made it clear that sex implies love, particularly
when there is a child in the house, while Darryl has made it
clear that sex is sex and can exist as its own cultural model
independent from the cultural model of romantic love. Hence,
there is room for ambiguity and contestation between the users

of similar cultural models within our theory of cultural
models.
Interview 3. About 2 months after the second interview, Dar-
ryl had been seeing Hannah for some time and decided that
he would tell his son about his "strong feelings" for her.
D:
Well my son was kind of disturbed; on the week-
ends he sleeps in my bed as a . . . what he calls "a
special treat." We started this when he was very
young. . . . However, he's 9 now and he should be
moving into his own bed anyway and of course
this brings up feelings of jealousy and daddy
loves her more than he loves me.And I explain to
him that I love him just as much as I ever did.
VdM: Did he want to sleep with you.
D:
Oh he definitely wanted to sleep with me but I
said that well Hannah's going to be sleeping in
there. And he said, "I don't care I'm sleeping in
the middle" and every opportunity he got when-
ever we could get close to each other he would
get right between us . . . so he was feeling threat-
ened. And I indicated to her that, that you know .
. . that she needed to also understand his needs
and that he was feeling threatened and that she
needed to make him feel comfortable by giving
him a hug.
VdM: Oh she wasn't doing that?
D:
No, no, in fact there was one occasion where . . .
she's always been pleasant to him . . . but there
was this one occasion where she was standing in
front of me and he came into the room and he
immediately got between us and he put his arms
around me and he was hugging me and she put
her arms like over his shoulder and reached
another hand under his shirt and pinched his
chest and immediately tears came to his eyes and
he went "ohh" and leaned over . . . and I was just
hugging I didn't know what the problem was. He
slipped out between the two of us and he was
kind of crying . . . so I asked him what the prob-
lem was and she walked into the other room, into
the kitchen, and I asked him well what's the
problem, and so then he said, "she pinched me
really hard and it hurt." . . . When I confronted
her, "oh did I hurt him I didn't mean to, I didn't
realize that it had hurt him I just gave him a little
friendly pinch." I don't know I was thinking well
do I say . . . you know . . . reasonable doubt . . .
maybe she didn't really think she was hurting or
maybe it was intentional on her part maybe she
was feeling threatened that . . . and that didn't do
anything for my feeling any closer . . . this past
weekend she was very friendly to him and he
was very friendly to her. . . . he's never . . . I don't
think it's been an issue . . . a lot of times the
women that I have met and gone home with are
from school that are younger and as soon as they
see him and what a responsibility he is they usu-
ally run the other way . . .
Assessment of proposed cultural model.In a situation in
which alternative cultural models can be applied (instanti-
ated), members of the culture choose which to foreground--
even if there may exist cultural defaults concerning how to
rank and prioritize them. Darryl's role as father trumps his role
as lover to Hannah. Hannah's attempt to become a full mem-
ber of the family meets with active resistance from Rich (the
son) as well as passive resistance from Darryl. This is clear
when Rich tearfully tells his father how Hannah pinched him
under his shirt and that it "hurt" him. Darryl, after discuss-
ing the incident with Hannah, took a neutral position, stat-
ing "reasonable doubt." Thereafter, after perhaps boundaries
had been established, Rich and Hannah were friendlier with
each other. He added that other (younger) women who had
come over and met Rich decided they were not interested in
developing a relationship with Darryl. Thus, Darryl's rather
passive behavior, conciliatory, and affectionate responses to
Hannah suggest that he also recognizes that while he may not
be "in love" with her, she might represent the best possibility
for a woman to become part of his family as she has all sorts
of personal virtues. It seems then that he is, given his situ-
ation as an older, relatively poor male with a son, also cal-
culating the probability of achieving the prototypical family
image--that is, with Hannah as wife and mother--and that
this model becomes as salient in its "motivational" force as
the romantic love model. Roy D'Andrade (1992) stated that
the "marriage model" is nested in the romantic love model
because a person will say "I married because I am in love
with X," but to say "I am in love with X because I married X"
does not (in our culture) make sense. Thus, for D'Andrade,
"love" is the master motive and "marriage" the basic-level
motive. But that is taking these two as logical and isolated
concepts not as contextualized "thought-feeling" complexes
as Claudia Strauss (1992) described cultural models.
In the fourth interview, 9 months later, Darryl said that he
and Hannah were making arrangements for her to move in
officially, as she was staying at his house frequently. He was
still not "in love" with her but had decided that he loved her,
and his son had grown to love her, too. Thus, apparently, over
time, the conflicts between Hannah and Rich were resolved
and, as he repeated, they "were no longer an issue."
Conclusion
The two case studies we have presented show that the pro-
posed cultural model of romantic love provides insight and
has some predictive strength. We have proposed that the key
attribute field categorizations for a U.S. cultural model of
romantic love are: high and low energy associated with good
de Munck and Kronenfeld 15
feelings (e.g., excited, passion, comfortable, content), a men-
tal ledger indexing mutuality (in commitment, altruism,
trust), and personal virtues (e.g., honest, intelligent, humor).
We do not offer a cultural model comprised of three or so
styles or traits as do most love researchers, but view our pro-
posed cultural model as a flexible, generic set of normative
scenarios that people see as exemplifying romantic love and
triggered at specific times or in given situations. Such catego-
rizations are informants' culturally standard attribution of
attributes to the cultural model's story--attributes that can be
used by informants to index the cultural model, especially
where the cultural model is used as a reference standard. For
instance, if one's lover is suddenly leaving for a long trip, one
may for reassurance index mutual ideas and feelings of com-
mitment and trust, and also various personal virtues such as
honesty. A cultural model must be "thin" enough to encom-
pass many different situations, phases of a relationship, and
feelings; yet it must not be so thin that it is too abstract and
general for specific uses. Our cultural model approach meets
this "just right" criteria. Further work will allow for a greater
fleshing out of the types of unmarked normative stories
indexed by our cultural model.
We think that the freelist and pile sort material and the
sample used (plus its fit with many other studies cited) pro-
vide strong evidence that the proposed cultural model of
romantic love is one held by some (even if it is not yet clear
how many) North Americans. Much more work will need to
be done to determine the reach and use of this cultural model.
This is a test run of our theory. There are some issues we
need to address in the future. First, we need to repeat the
basic methodology with different samples to evaluate the
validity, reliability, and reach of our proposed cultural model
and also to discover if there are other prototypical models.
For reliability testing, we would need to gather samples in
other areas of North America and see if through the same
procedures of freelisting and pile sorting, we would come up
with substantially the same cultural model. For testing the
external validity of our proposed model, we have predicted
that those who meet the criteria for a satisfying love relation-
ship according to our model would also report being satisfied
with their love relationship. Those, like Rose, who feel some
area of the cultural model for a good love relationship is
lacking--such as passion or mutuality--would mention this
dissatisfaction in interviews or surveys and probably attempt
to resolve this dissatisfaction.
We need to develop the field/dimension concept (i.e., good-
bad/low-high energy) a bit more to recognize how it relates to
the actual cultural model scenario, how the fields "fit" together,
and whether they vary in salience across individuals, contexts,
gender, personality types, the life cycle, and so on. Third, we
perhaps need to be more attentive to the distinction between
the continuum of dimensions and the respective parts (or fields
and attributes) and the holistic conception of romantic love
expressed particularly by Darryl. We need to further explore
the relations among these parts and conceptions--and to
consider how elements, which in the basic story form are part
of a seamless assemblage, can emerge as distinct entities in
tasks such as freelists of relevant attributes or in situations
where one is clearly "missing in action." Fourth, we need to
consider both logically derived and actual variant models of
the prototypical model we have proposed and the conditions
and processes through which such variants are developed.
Fifth, we need to elicit a wide variety of scenarios to develop
unmarked scenarios that are associated with the fields and
attributes we have proposed. Sixth, we also need to consider
the flexibility of cultural models as they compete with con-
trasting models of either the same situation (e.g., other models
of romantic love) or different situations (e.g., romantic love vs.
parenting), and to discover a means to determine which mod-
els are likely to contrast with which other models and under
what conditions.
On the positive side of the ledger, we do believe that the
work we have done provides a kind of recipe for constructing
and analyzing cultural models. Undoubtedly, there are many
other ways to do this; however, we consider the theoretical
and methodological guidelines proposed serve as a "good
recipe" that we hope others will decide to employ in their
own research.
