Introduction
Diversity is a central policy goal in achieving democracy,
whichhasguidedtheFederalCommunicationsCommission's
(FCC) action in media regulation (see Report and Order and
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report and Order
and Order on Reconsideration, 2008). Although the role of
diversity in sustaining democracy is presumable, the diver-
sity principle and regulatory concepts applied to communi-
cations policy seem far from reaching a practical consensus.
Among the regulatory challenges to achieving diversity
goals are controversy on a theoretical level, inconsistent
measurement, the interplay of conflicting public interest
motivations, and the changes in the media system. Critics,
for example, have indicated that policies designed to pro-
mote diversity are contradictory due to the FCC's impreci-
sion in defining its regulatory concepts and the limitations of
diversity measurement (see Candeub, 2008; Hill, 2006; Ho
& Quinn, 2009). An increasingly politicized policymaking
process itself, struggling over ideological conflict (see
Braman, 2003; Napoli, 2008; Napoli & Gillis, 2006), is also
another problem associated with diversity policy. The trans-
formed media environment due to technological develop-
ments and media convergence has eliminated much of the
legal validity of the scarcity concept that has served as a fun-
damental justification for the FCC's public interest standard
in broadcast regulation. The marketplace of ideas that has
replaced the scarcity rationale, and served a primary justifi-
cation for ownership regulation is now under critical scrutiny
due to its contradictory effects on diversity. Growing judicial
skepticism about the FCC's economic antitrust-based deci-
sion in formulating the logic of public interest has opposed to
the long-standing presumed link between ownership diver-
sity and content diversity (see Schurz Communications,
Incorporated v. FCC and the United States of America, 1992;
Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC, 1998).
The discussion above reflects the conceptual, legal, and
regulatory challenges the FCC confronts for the promotion
of pluralism and diversity. In response to the issue high-
lighted, this article investigates the diversity policy within a
broad context of legal, political, economic, and sociocul-
tural grounds: It (a) proposes a policy model that offers a
platform for the analysis of the policy implications and deci-
sions, (b) analyzes the existing policy imposed to achieve
diversity goals, and (c) addresses regulatory challenges.

The Diversity Policy Model and
Assessment of the Policy: Debates
and Challenges of (Media) Diversity
Kim P. McCann1
Abstract
Diversity is a central policy goal in achieving democracy, which has guided the Federal Communications Commission's
action in media ownership regulation. Although the role of diversity in sustaining democracy is presumable, the diversity
principle and regulatory concepts applied to communications policy seem far from reaching a practical consensus. Among
the regulatory challenges to achieving diversity goals are controversy on a theoretical level, inconsistent measurement, the
interplay of conflicting public interest motivations, and the changes in the media system. This article investigates the diversity
policy within a broad context of legal, political, economic, and sociocultural grounds: It proposes an integrative policy model
that offers a platform for the analysis of the policy implications and decisions, analyzes the existing policy imposed to achieve
diversity goals, and suggests alternative ways of responding to current regulatory challenges for strengthening policymaking.

challenges for strengthening policymaking. The proposed
policy model is integrative, self-reflexive, and procedural in
its nature, which provides several benefits: First, it recon-
ciles the perceived theoretical and ideological schism in for-
mulating the public interest, as it combines the benefits of
economic development with social unity in fulfilling democ-
racy. Second, it is flexible in responding to the current policy
condition because the self-reflexive mechanism corrects and
renews the ongoing policy system. Finally, it offers the
grounds for communication research contributing to the pol-
icy process for its procedural step essentially involves vari-
ous contextual analyses that in turn demands communication
resources and research. See Figure 1 for the proposed model.
The Policy Objective:
The Public Interest Standard
One major challenge in the development of diversity policy
stems from the competing principles of the public interest.
The FCC's interpretation of the public interest mandate
means achieving competition, diversity, and localism (Report
and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report
and Order on Reconsideration, 2008). Alas, these concepts
are elusive, and difficult to measure. There is considerable
conceptual overlap between localism and diversity, which
makes it difficult to distinguish localism from diversity.
More importantly, not all these values fit into the existing
policy framework due to its deficiency in social and political
evaluative criteria. While competition lends itself to the
existing economic analysis, diversity and localism do not
(Ho & Quinn, 2009). As history tells us, the failure of diver-
sity policy is often a result of the FCC's vague definition of
regulatory concepts of diversity, closely tied to the public
interest standard.
Establishing the Public Interest Standard: Political,
Social, and Economic Values
Media and communications policy is made for the benefit of
the public. The public, according to John Dewey, is a social
creation that is not biased toward government administrative
goals nor individual freedom, but the product that reflects
consequences of social, political, and economic consider-
ations we all share (see also Aufderheid, 1999; Van
Cuilenburg & McQuail, 2003, for the dimensions of the pub-
lic interest). Although the public interest may take various
forms, depending on what current national policy empha-
sizes and how a legal system operates in a society, the gen-
eral components of public interest should encompass these
three considerations, necessary for guiding media and com-
munications policy.
The criteria defining political values are associated with
the function of democracy, ensured by the adoption of the
First Amendment: Pluralism and diversity are political goals,
concerned with whether diverse ownership and content
would cultivate informed citizenry for their meaningful par-
ticipation in democratic public life. Social values relate to
the social impact of media content in terms of cultural and
social benefits; under this consideration, diversity concerns
whether diverse viewpoints in media content foster socially
desirable outcomes for the public needs. Economic values
relate to the economic efficiency of technology, competition,
and profits; under this consideration, diversity concerns
whether diverse competition and media outlets provides an
access for citizens' participatory democracy. Economic val-
ues, however, are more effective in facilitating pluralism
than diversity. Understood by and large, the political premise
of freedom of expression, such as democracy, has been
enforced through the economic consideration of effective
competition as well the social consideration of critical and
substantive media content. Discerning the complementary
function of the public interest is thus desirable for approving
particular communication services and improving the poli-
cies while avoiding a potential political conflict, fueled by
following the narrow logic in competing principles (see
Figure 2).
Diversity Policy Objective: Pluralism to Serve
Democracy
Diversity as political pluralism is to achieve democracy. By
creating diverse sources, and ideas (i.e., pluralism) through
an open communication system (i.e., public sphere or mar-
ketplace), it attempts to facilitate genuine public debate by
participation of well-informed citizens (i.e., democracy).
Within this framing, diversity policymaking starts from stat-
ing a clear policy objective, that is, "creating pluralism to
serve democracy." The critical relationship between media
and democracy in a society has often been debated, primarily
due to the presumption that media exercises a critical public

role in cultivating citizenship. Whether citizens take an
active role in making a democratic decision largely hinges on
the responsibility of media in a self-governing system. This
raises a diversity inquiry into whether the current media sys-
tem functions as a source of guidance for citizens' participa-
tion and deliberation in democracy, which ultimately guides
the FCC's implementation of the public interest standard for
the diversity policy.
Theory Proposed:
Guidance to the Policymaking
The Integrative Theory: Political
Outcomes in Economic and Social Contexts
Two major approaches to diversity revolve around the eco-
nomic and social values of media's democratic performance:
Each conceptualizes media diversity within separate domains
and proposes divergent ways of envisioning audiences,
namely,"citizens"and"consumers,"respectively.Responding
to such division, many critics have suggested the need for
conceptual clarification in the study of communications pol-
icy (e.g., Braman, 2003; Entman & Wildman, 1992; Giddens,
2000; Meehan, 1981; Mullender, 2000; Streeter, 1990; Vick,
2006). Braman (2003), for example, pointed out that the fail-
ure of issue-oriented policy analysis is due to certain theoreti-
cal propositions that oversimplify contradictions and
complexities of the negotiation held by policymakers. In a
similar vein, Entman and Wildman (1992) criticized the lack
of constructive discussion between the market economics and
social value schools of thoughts and unwillingness to learn
from the other's approach.
The proposed theory responds to the need for developing
an analytical framework for diversity policy that involves the
wider intellectual frames consistent to the public interest
standard, and discerning complementary functions of social
and economic goal in achieving political goal, democracy.
Social and economic theories share common goals in the
specific context of media regulation, such as pursuing lib-
erty, pluralism, and diversity, although they differ in their
preferred means of achieving these goals. The effort in con-
ceptual clarification of the diversity principle, thus, should
examine common goals as well as contentious issues devel-
oped from social and economic standpoints on the diversity
policy.
Economic Approach: Empirical Claim and
Efficiency of Competition
The economic approach has its roots in market liberalism,
dubbed the market economics. It maintains that the media
should carry content that most appeals to consumers, and suc-
cess of media performance is primarily measured by market
behavior (see Candeub, 2008; Croteau & Hoynes, 2006;
Miller, 2011; Shelanski, 2006). Entrenched in laissez-faire
economics, the market economics proposes the benefits of the
free market, advancing the neutral role of government due to
its distrust of government. The market is more responsible to
consumers than the state, thus can enhance consumer choices
(Vick, 2006). By establishing a free market line, the economic
approach legitimatized deregulation policy (see Candeub,
2008; Curran, 2000; Hopkins, 1996; Vick, 2006). To that
extent, the market theory offers an assumption that pluralism
and diversity will flourish within a free marketplace.
The economic concept of market liberalism has been
widely applied in the courts and ownership regulations,
dubbed the marketplace of ideas metaphor. Accordingly, the
marketplace of ideas has served as the theoretical underpin-
ning of the diversity principle in the United States (see
Candeub, 2008; Curran, 2000; Hopkins, 1996; Napoli, 1999;
Vick, 2006) as it was introduced by Justice Holmes (1919) in
his dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States. The meta-
phor suggests that the best policy can be made out of the
"competition of extensively various ideas" in an unregulated
market, well reflected in the FCC's assumption that ensuring
antagonistic sources would be instrumental to achieving
diverse viewpoints for audiences.
In policy and juridical circumstances, empirical evidence
takes an important role in justifying FCC's regulatory efforts.
Economic analysis is inherently quantitative, and thus can
estimate the causal mechanism involved in the issue by either
proving or disproving the theory. Such an empirical assess-
ment functions to narrow down a general claim of diversity
to testable outcomes, and accordingly can generate prag-
matic alternatives to the market reality. Historically, eco-
nomic analysis has a large role to play in policymaking.

However, the empirical analyses of the economic
approach alone do not effectively capture the democratic val-
ues associated with media content (i.e., diverse viewpoint
cultivating citizenship). Although mass media policy has
used various methods to serve the policy interests of market
efficiency and democratic issues (Shelanski, 2006), demo-
cratic values within the economic approach have often been
defined as pluralism satisfying popular demands rather than
diversity. Moreover, the FCC has failed to provide substan-
tial evidence to prove the nexus between liberalizing media
markets and preserving deliberative democratic values.
Consumers' ideas are often the opposite of the diverse intel-
lectual activity and politically informed public body the mar-
ketplace of ideas suggests, as they tend to eschew challenging
established notions (see Curran, 2000; Entman & Wildman,
1992). This illustrates the limitation of market economics in
offering appropriate insights into diversity policy goals, and
the need for incorporating a social approach to the diversity
principle and policy development.
Social Approach: Moral Claim and the Media
Content in Cultivating Deliberative Democracy
The social-based theory, in general, pursues statism, egalitar-
ian, and deliberative democracy (see Baker, 2007; Croteau &
Hoyne, 2006; Curran, 2000; Entman & Wildman, 1992;
Giddens, 2000; Mullender, 2000; Vick, 2006). Statism finds
expression in the advocacy of government intervention for
enhancing social values and protecting the public interest
against the private market power. It purports that unregulated
private market power is socially detrimental, and can be a
threat to democracy, diversity, and freedom of expression;
thus, it does not identify market efficiency as a primary goal
of media policy (see Giddens, 2000; Mullender, 2000; Vick,
2006). Concerned with the inequality of market power, social
advocates would argue that the decentralization of media
ownership, for its own sake, should be a political goal (e.g.,
Baker, 2005, 2009; Croteau, 2003; McChesney, 1997, 1999).
However, they also view the ownership restrictions relying
on economic mechanism of antitrust law as failure in terms
of connecting to any quantifiable social and political goals
(see Candeub, 2008).
With an emphasis on deliberative democracy, promoting
diversity is seen as facilitating an informed public discussion
of important issues and rational-critical debates (see
Shelanski, 2006). To achieve such goals, it underlines the
media's obligation to pursue social goals as public resources
over their professed organizational goals. Hence, diversity is
assessed in terms of whether the media facilitate critical
independent thought among citizens, information quality,
and the social/cultural order in society, and whether policy
can effectively help the media provide different viewpoints.
Because of assuring citizens'informed judgments about pub-
lic issues, the social approach meets the requirement for
deliberative democratic values of media content vital to
achieve diversity. Unfortunately though, social values are
often dismissed as externalities by market economics propo-
nents because they are not easily quantifiable (see Baker,
2009; Entman & Wildman, 1992).
Application of the Policy: Government
Action and Court Challenges
The application to policy involves not only government reg-
ulations on behalf of the public interest, but also court chal-
lenges and judicial decisions about the constitutionality of
proposed rules. The constitutionality of the rules and regula-
tions, in this way, hinges on the government's logic to justify
the public interest. The following briefly provides regulatory
concepts of diversity defined by the FCC to increase the
understanding of how the FCC uses them, and second exam-
ines the imposition of the regulations rules and the FCC's
justifications for them.
Concepts of Diversity Defined by the FCC
The FCC defined diversity as five distinctive yet interrelated
concepts, namely, viewpoint, program, outlet, source, and
minority and women ownership diversity (FCC, 2011;
Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,
2003): Viewpoint diversity refers to the availability of media
content reflecting a variety of perspectives; Program diver-
sity refers to a variety of programming formats and content;
Outlet diversity means that, in a given market, there are mul-
tiple independently owned firms; Source diversity refers to
the availability of media content from a variety of content
producers; Minority and female ownership diversity refers to
encouraging minority and female ownership (Report and
Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003, para
19-42). The first two concern content diversity while the
later three concern ownership diversity. Insisting on the pre-
sumed link between ownership diversity and content diver-
sity, the FCC has attempted to create viewpoint and program
diversity through outlet, source, and workforce diversity.
This explains that the FCC regulatory concepts center pri-
marily on competition of ownership to achieve diversity
goals.
Content Control:
Fairness Doctrine­Political Viewpoints
In spite of the First Amendment conflict, the content of
broadcasting has been subject to censorship due to its legally
distinctive nature; broadcasting can reach the general public
and broadcasters are public trustees for the public. A primary
example is the fairness doctrine, mostly linked to viewpoint
diversity. The fairness doctrine reflects the public interest
rationale for content restriction, allowing government
McCann 5
supervision of broadcasters' programming, mandating more
diverse programming, and particularly political viewpoints
(see "In Re Application of Great Lakes," 1929). The fairness
doctrine-based content restriction was validated and consti-
tuted by firm establishment of the scarcity rationale in Red
Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC (1969). Nonetheless, faced
with FirstAmendment challenges, the public interest demand
for media delivering diverse viewpoints does not seem appli-
cable to an increasingly competitive economic environment.
Accordingly, with its opinion in Syracuse Peace Councils in
1986, the FCC refused to enforce the fairness doctrine, and
formally abolished it in 1987.
Ownership Regulations: Economic Analysis of
Antitrust Law
The FCC's efforts to achieve diversity goals have focused
heavily on ownership structure, largely guided by the eco-
nomic principles of antitrust law (see Connolly & Kwerel,
2007; Ho & Quinn, 2009). The ownership regulations
involve the three areas: ownership of outlet (outlet diversity),
ownership of programming (source diversity), and owner-
ship of workforce within the distribution system (minority
and female ownership diversity).
From the cross-ownership rules to cross-media limit: Outlet and
viewpoint diversity. The FCC adheres to the presumption that out-
let diversity is the most reliable means of promoting viewpoint
diversity (Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemak-
ing, 2003). To preserve outlet diversity, the FCC has imposed
various cross-ownership rules to prevent common ownership
within the same market (e.g., newspapers-broadcaster cross-
ownership and the television-radio cross-ownership). The
public interest rationale for these rules was to protect the
availability of viewpoint diversity, pertinent to editorial con-
tent, to local communities, closely linked to localism. Yet,
the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule was substan-
tially relaxed and the television-radio cross-ownership rule
was entirely eliminated (retained now due to a failure of jus-
tifying the new rules), based on the FCC's adoption of the
cross-media limits in 2002. The Commission explained that
there is no substantial record that indicates that the cross-
ownership limits significantly protect a diversity of view-
points (or localism) in those media (Report and Order and
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report and Order
and Order on Reconsideration, 2008).
When the commission fist proposed the newspaper-
broadcast cross-ownership rule it was challenged in FCC v.
National Citizens Committee for Broadcasting (1978). The
court, however, held the validity of the challenged regula-
tions, accepting the difficulty of defining and measuring
viewpoint diversity (436 U.S. 793-815). Although it was
conceded that the rulemaking record was inconclusive in
establishing the connection between ownership limits and
viewpoint diversity, the court recognized the need
for qualitative judgment on defining an elusive concept of
viewpoint diversity. Nevertheless, the court began to take
seriously the connection between them in the Prometheus
Radio Project v. FCC, in which the court criticized the FCC's
use of the DI to measure viewpoint diversity, and remanded
it (Dissent by Chef Judge Scirica).
Fin/syn rules: Source and program/viewpoint diversity.The
FCC's ownership regulation to ensure content diversity is
also concerned with the ownership of program producers
(i.e., source diversity). Based on the belief that increasing
independent program suppliers furthers program and view-
point diversity, the FCC imposed Financial Interest and Syn-
dication rules (fin/syn). The fin/syn rules were originally
adopted in 1970 to restrict the three established networks
(ABC, CBS, and NBC) from owning monetary rights in syn-
dicated programs while encouraging the bargaining power
and profitability of independent program suppliers (see
Review of the Syndication and Financial Interest Rules,
1995; Rosencrans, 1990). The public interest rationale for
the fin-syn rules is to limit the networks' control over televi-
sion programming and thereby encourage the development
of a diversity program through diverse and antagonistic
sources of program services (Review of the Syndication and
Financial Interest Rules, 1995).
Notably, the rules have received substantial criticism.
Along with changes in the media market, the networks,
restricted from the syndication market, seemed unable to
compete with the cable and video companies in terms of the
price offered. The independent producers have tended to pur-
chase inexpensive products from domestic syndicators rather
than producing innovative and diverse television content. As
a result, in 1983, the FCC proposed eliminating much of the
fin/syn rules fueled by a deregulation climate. In 1991, after
receiving extensive comments and conducting a hearing, the
FCC relaxed certain aspects of the fin/syn, yet retained the
revised fin/syn rules. On appeal, however, the 1991 decision
was overturned by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit due to the failure of proving the nexus
between the modified rules and diversity goals (Review of
the Syndication and Financial Interest Rules, 1995). In
Schurz Communications, Incorporated v. FCC (1992), Judge
Posner criticized the logic of the public interest built on the
FCC's long-standing economic antitrust foreclosures applied
for enhancing diversity, and struck down the revised fin/syn
rules.
EEO rules: Workforce diversity and viewpoint diversity.The
Equal Employment of Opportunity rules (EEO) are an obvi-
ous example of the FCC's effort to create diverse viewpoints
or programming through the ownership of the workforce
within the distribution system. The EEO rules were designed
to ensure that minority groups (racial, ethnicity, and gender
based) have a fair chance of being employed in electronic
media services to foster diversity in programming. Yet, in
6 SAGE Open
Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod v. FCC (1998) the D.C.
Circuit court criticized the FCC's logic of formulating the
race-based rules, and rejected the FCC's ruling against the
church. According to the court, the FCC did not clarify what
exactly constitutes diversity of programming, and thus failed
to establish a connection between the minority ownership
and viewpoint diversity.
Outcomes: Court Decisions
and First Amendment Values
Scarcity Rationale: Constraint on Media
Voices for Socially Desirable Media Content
The legal question, raised by the court challenges, involves
the validity of the primary justification for media regula-
tions, which lends itself to different applications of First
Amendment values to the diversity policy. It addresses the
significant challenges in regulatory justification for achiev-
ing diversity goals. The scarcity rationale is the primarily
legal justification for broadcast regulations, allowing gov-
ernment intervention to promote the FirstAmendment values
for the public (see Krattenmaker & Powe, 1999; Spitzer
1989). The court imposed a legal presumption of distinctive
treatments for different communications media for First
Amendment purposes (476 U.S. 496), drawing on "the social
impact of the media content." Democracy (i.e., diversity) is,
thus, achieved through an adoption of the legal framework
based on the normative principle that demands diverse pro-
gramming or "socially desirable content," equally applicable
to all "citizens."
However, the constitutional significance of the scarcity
rationale was widely attacked during the convergence era
that legitimatized deregulation policy. The blurring media
services, due to technological innovation and digitalization,
goes beyond the ability of the broadcast model that is con-
fined to single media legislation. In this way, it seems impos-
sible for the Supreme Court to apply a distinctive legal
framework to First Amendment issues, evidenced when the
Supreme Court expressed doubts about continued reliance
on scarcity, and the minimal control of government over
broadcast programming in Turner Broadcasting v. FCC
(1994). Consequently, the diversity goals envisioning social
values and deliberative democracy, enforced within broad-
casting, have been greatly undermined.
The Marketplace of Ideas: Constraint on
Government Actions for a Robust Competition
While the changing media landscape eliminated much of the
scarcity in broadcast regulations, the marketplace of ideas
has been a prominent guiding metaphor for ownership deci-
sions. It has been primarily used for justifying economic
antitrust laws, drawn upon the value of efficient market,
responsive to the public needs. Democracy is thus achieved
through the First Amendment purpose that protects a robust
competition of multitude of media voices against the govern-
ment intervention, which in turn meets the public needs.
Nevertheless, the courts threw the validity of the market-
place of ideas into doubt, calling into question a mere eco-
nomic authorship over media structure with little regard to its
connection to democratic values of content diversity, particu-
larly viewpoint diversity (e.g., Schurz, Lutheran Church,
Time Warner, and Prometheus cases). With an undercurrent
of the demand for substantial proof to justify ownership
rules, the courts discredited the marketplace of ideas. The
question raised about the continued validity of the regulatory
justifications addresses the critical demands for reframing
the existing policy framework for an adequate implementa-
tion of the policy.
Assessment of Policy: Reviews and
Regulatory Challenges
Section 202 (h) of the Telecommunication Act of 1996
allows the Commission to periodically review its ownership
rules (except the national television ownership limit) and
determine whether any of such rules are necessary in the
public interest as the result of competition (Report and Order
and Order on Reconsideration, 2008). The reviews of 1998,
2002 Biennial and 2006 and 2010 Quadrennial involve
important policy issues of (a) the deregulatory climate gov-
erning the marketplace ideas, (b) the challenges in defining
regulatory concepts in terms of competition, diversity, and
localism, and (c) the limitation of the entire range of existing
economic regulation to further diversity.
Deregulation Policy and Value of Monopoly
The FCC's decisions within the 2002 Biennial and 2006 and
2010 Quadrennial Review Orders reflect their profound con-
sideration of diversity at the local level or localism, and the
increased provision of the benefits of common ownership. In
2002 Biennial Review and Order, the Commission signifi-
cantly relaxed the cross-ownership limits with an adoption of
the cross-media limits, derived from the Diversity Index
(DI). In completing the 2006 Quadrennial Regulatory
Review, the FCC further relaxed the 32-year-old ban on
newspaper/broadcast ownership rules within the television
market (Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration,
2008). The rules ban not only certain newspaper/broadcast
cross-ownership combinations in the top 20 markets, but
generally will apply to all other markets (Report and Order
and Order on Reconsideration, 2008).
The ownership decisions, contained in 2002 and 2006
Orders, are based on the FCC's belief that the cross-ownership
actually produces localism rather than harms competition; the
newspaper-owned television stations tend to produce local
news and public affairs programming (Report and Order and
Order on Reconsideration, 2008, para. 15). The FCC's
McCann 7
consideration of the benefits of common ownership is also
based on the assumption that the technological advancements
support the operation of mainstream media companies deliv-
ering news and information to their local communicates (see
Report and Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003;
Report and Order and Order on Reconsideration, 2008). The
growing number of media outlets for news and information,
and entertainment today provides more choices via nontradi-
tional modes of media, such as cable, satellite television, digi-
tal transmission, and the Internet (Report and Order and
Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003; Report and Order and
Order on Reconsideration, 2008).
The FCC's significant liberalization of the media owner-
ship was not a simple modification of the rules, but rather a
significant change in media structure, which allows substan-
tial concentration in the national and local television markets.
The ownership decisions encompass the benefits of a free
market, provisioned by values of monopoly in creating mul-
tiple media outlets or voices for consumers. In fact, the sig-
nificant teleological advancements have fully developed
economic sectors around electronic media and telecommuni-
cations since the 1970s, leading to vertical integration of the
previously separated communication industry, known as con-
vergence (see McQuail & Siune, 1998; Miller, 2011; Vick,
2006). With increased provisions of economic viability of
communication services, the value of monopoly has been
reconsidered. The market liberalists and economists advanced
the benefit of monopoly and contrived competition among
corporate media, necessary for increasing national compati-
bility within globalized market.
Nevertheless, the commonly expressed concern raised by
critics indicates a gradual decline of the public accountability
of media and rational debates among citizens (see Miller,
2011).Today's highly competitive media system with increased
news outlets hasn't yielded a sufficient amount of public issues
and diverse news (see Entman, 2003; Miller, 2011). One of
major caveats is that more outlets produced by new media do
not necessarily offer new media content when "broadcast TV
programs are recycled for cable channels, and newspaper and
cable news content is repackaged for the internet, and so on."
(Croteau, D. Federal Communications Commission Broadcast
Ownership En Banc. Virginia, 27 February 2003. http://transi-
tion.fcc.gov/ownership/enbanc022703_docs/Croteau.pdf)
Relevant research also indicated that media diversity has
declined where scarcity has been more present after the pas-
sage of the Telecommunication act of 1996, in broadcasting
and local media (e.g., Croteau, 2003; Einstein, 2004). The
decline of space for new programs and for public services and
the creation of polarized online discussions were also true in
spite of a multichannel environment (see Campbell, Martin, &
Fabos, 2012; Dahlberg, 2007).
Defining Regulatory Concepts
In the 1998 Biennial Review, the cross-ownership limits of
cable and broadcasting were vacated by the D.C. Circuit due
to the FCC's inability to precisely define what constitutes a
voice for diversity. For the constitutionality of the proposed
ownership rules, the Commission used the DI (Report and
Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 2003) to mea-
sure viewpoint diversity at the local market. The DI was
designed to measure viewpoint diversity by giving insight
into consumers'reported preferences for their media sources
of information and news (see Prometheus). It weighs the
market share of various media outlets in local media mar-
kets for antitrust purposes. Nevertheless, the DI does not
directly measure, nor sufficiently measure viewpoint diver-
sity. With its economic scheme, it measures the number of
participants rather than to coherently measure viewpoint
diversity (see Candeub, 2008; Hill, 2006). The court found
that DI is not clearly linked to viewpoint diversity, citing in
its remands that the Commission irrationally assigned out-
lets of the same media-type equal market shares, and incon-
sistently derived the cross-media limits from its DI results
(Prometheus).
On the issue remanded by the Third Court in Prometheus,
the FCC commissioned the empirical research, namely, the
Media Ownership Study that informed the 2006
Quadrennial Review of the ownership policies. Yet, the
broad and inconsistent definition of local and localism ren-
ders contradictory results from the research, making its
application questionable. The definition of local identified
by the FCC was based on a Designated Market Area
(DMA) as determined by Nielsen Media Research, which
has boundaries of geographically distinctive television
viewing areas. For example, the FCC's previous research
conducted by Alexander and Brown (2004) established the
necessarily condition for measuring localism where view-
points or local stores take place within DMA. In contrast,
under the Media Ownership Study of 2006, localism does
not appear to be precisely delineated from DMA, expend-
ing from geographically bounded definition of local within
state to a broader one across state (e.g., Milyo, 2007).
Furthermore, a broad definition of localism resulted in
inconsistency in defining the local content and news.
According to the FCC, localism is broadly defined as the
level of responsiveness of a station to the needs of its local
communities and local news and quality. Given such a def-
inition, any story would be considered a local content. The
inconsistency of defining local content is apparent when
Milyo's (2007) study included sports and weather in the
component of local news, which has been excluded in the
FCC's previous research (e.g., Alexander & Brown, 2004).
Of course, a broad definition of local and localism inevita-
bly overestimates the local content. More importantly,
what makes the FCC's research unsustainable is that only
a few studies respond to the intention of the court's demand
for precisely defining viewpoint diversity. For instance,
Milyo's (2007) study appears to be the only one perform-
ing content analysis that directly measures local content
and the political slant of local television news among the
others of the Media Ownership Study.

Limitation of Economic
Regulation for Democratic Values
The use of the DI to measure viewpoint diversity and incon-
sistency of measuring localism indicate the FCC's inability
or unwillingness to define viewpoint diversity. It also
explains the FCC's assumption that viewpoint diversity
could be empirically established by a justification for eco-
nomic effects-based competition policy. Approached empir-
ically though, the existing economic analysis is not effective
to measure political or democratic values of viewpoint
diversity. As Baker (2009) noted, the problem with view-
point measurement is its reliance on what is easy to measure
rather than what is important. Similarly, Entman and
Wildman (1992) argued that democratic values of media
diversity do not seem to render economic analysis. Along
with scholarly criticism, growing judicial skepticism about
viewpoint diversity clearly points out an inclusiveness of
the entire range of the existing economic regulations to fur-
ther democratic values of diversity. In retrospect, the FCC
would continually confront difficulty in making its regula-
tion constitutional in the future unless it provides substantial
empirical backing for the presumption that diversity of own-
ership is an essential proxy for content diversity or view-
point diversity.
Revision
Policy Objectives: Government
Responsiveness to the Major Problem
The policy analysis in the previous sections addresses
insufficient government responsiveness to the major prob-
lem with the unpredictable impact of a new media land-
scape on the marketplace. Instead of balancing the
potentially negative effect of ownership concentration on
diversity against the economic viability of struggling media
outlets, the policy tends to leave out the democratic value
of diversity, insofar as the assessment of diversity has relied
on the economic impact of the marketplace. In opposition
to the democratic purpose of antitrust law, its economic
analysis has provided justification for significant relaxation
of ownership. Although the First Amendment principles for
unprecedented media convergence inherently value the lib-
eralization of ownership undermining the traditional regu-
latory rationale, it is important to recognize the courts'
shifting concern from the structure of the communication
market to the content of communication, and government is
responsible to that content contributing to democracy (see
Krattenmaker & Powe, 1995). With this regard, two possi-
ble responses the FCC could make to the given regulatory
challenges are (a) developing a more sophisticated and rig-
orous measure of viewpoint diversity, aimed at democratic
values, and (b) diversity of ownership as a separate political
goal from viewpoint diversity.
Metrics of Viewpoint Diversity: Input of
Communication Research Into the Policy
The regulatory challenges address the need for empirical evi-
dence about viewpoint diversity, yet existing quantifiable
measures lack in accounting variables that influence out-
comes of viewpoint diversity. More critically, a substantial
effort to increase analytical resources has been degraded in
spite of increasingly evidence-driven policymaking
demanded by current law (see Napoli, 2008). The perceived
gap between the FCC's rationale for economic regulations
and judicial interpretation of First Amendment values of
diversity addresses the need for a collaborate effort of poli-
cymakers, legal, and communication scholars in answering
the constitutional questions and capitalizing the norms for an
empirical assessment of diversity. Indeed, the input of com-
munication research into the policymaking is valuable in
responding to the courts' increased requirement for convinc-
ing empirical justification for viewpoint diversity. A number
of scholars provide the value of communication research that
provides informational inputs to policymaking (e.g., Braman,
2003; Napoli, 1999).
To develop a more sophisticated and meaningful metrics
of viewpoint diversity, diversity inquires should entail the
complementary functions of (a) deliberative democracy that
ensures substantive ideas and information for cultivating
informed citizenry and (b) participatory democracy that
encourages citizens' engagement in the democratic process.
The norms for assessing viewpoint diversity thus encompass
the inquiry into how media democratic system affects
informed citizenry, and in turn how citizens' widespread
habit of media use affects their democratic decisions. Such
metrics of viewpoint should be drawn from a collective
understanding of normative and empirical inferences devel-
oped and contextualized within and across economic and
social disciplines that propose reasons for value-laden
inquires as well as statistical analysis, respectively.
Normative and Empirical Inferences
Unlike the critical social approach that challenges the uncriti-
cal acceptance of empirical findings and proposes an unquan-
tifiable nature of social values with its normative approach,
social scientists have empirically or statistically measured
"social values" with its positive approach. Inversely, statisti-
cal analysis quantified by the market economics is not neces-
sarily drawn from positive inferences, as its conceptual root is
grounded in Marxist's critical perspective that proposes nor-
mative social justice based on class analysis. Moreover, con-
temporary economic approaches have imposed a critical role
of government to attain the desired democratic needs, which
is opposed to the classical market approach (see Van
Cuilenburg & McQuail, 2003). Understanding such complex-
ity of theoretical and methodological propositions in terms of
democracy, developed within and across the social and
McCann 9
economic field, is important to avoid theoretical schism and
ideological conflict that often hinders developing a compre-
hensive and schematic assessment of diversity. In other
words, two democratic values of diversity, such as delibera-
tive and participatory democracy, should be explained from
the interdisciplinary interplay between normative and empiri-
cal inquires developed across a variety of disciplines without
generalization of each approach.
Deliberative democracy: Political diversity reflected in media
content.The FCC's definition of viewpoint diversity and
various approaches to it have involved these two democratic
values stated above. Traditionally, as reflected in Red Lion,
and enforced through the fairness doctrine, viewpoint diver-
sity would measure "political endorsement." Later, as stated
by Hundt (1996), the measure of viewpoint diversity involves
"editorial perspective" or editorial content. Most recently,
the FCC in the 2003 Report and Order states that viewpoint
diversity is most easily measured through "news and public
affairs programming," concerning political ideas and infor-
mation necessary to guide the cultivation of rational delib-
eration between citizens. These tell that the norms of
viewpoint diversity underline deliberative democratic values
represented in media content, which affects the robustness of
democratic participation of citizens by increasing political
knowledge or ideological viewpoints. Under this direction,
many researchers have developed variables relevant to polit-
ical endorsement, and editorial perspectives and positions in
news and public affairs programming in measuring view-
point diversity (e.g., Entman, 1989; Halavais, 2007; Ho &
Quinn, 2009; Miller, Goldenberg, & Erbring, 1979). The
variables that involve such deliberative democratic values of
viewpoint diversity are
·
· Newspaper or broadcast content based on political
endorsements
·
· Counts of time and space allotted to political candi-
dates in broadcast.
·
· Political content (liberal vs. conservative positions) of
news articles offered by newspaper editors and
broadcasters
·
· Word frequencies in editorials and news article
Viewpoint diversity reflecting deliberative democracy is
critical to cultivate well-informed citizenry; thus, their par-
ticipation in democracy is accountable. The scholarly criti-
cism questioning the reliability of viewpoint diversity stems
from the deficiency of critical social values of deliberative
democracy in its measurement, which is closely linked to the
methodological flaw of the DI that measured the number of
participants in a market (number of media outlet) rather than
substantive viewpoints. Continual efforts in capitalizing and
advancing norms for deliberative democratic values of view-
point diversity are critical to empirically assessing the social
benefits of media content.
Participatory democratic values: Survey of citizens and use of
media. Viewpoint diversity extends its definition to partici-
patory democracy that accentuates the citizens' participation
in their democratic public life. Technological advances have
greatly increased citizens' active participation in public
issues and democratic decisions through an interactive
medium, namely, the Internet. The emphasis of participatory
democratic values of viewpoint diversity inherently involves
audience research, such as surveying citizens or ethnographic
inquiries into citizen's information processing through vari-
ous mediums. The norms for viewpoint diversity in this
approach involve access for civic engagement in democratic
decision via news and information served by various media
outlets (see Braman, 2007; Horwitz, 2005; Waldfogel, 2007).
The citizens'right to receive a diverse range of ideas through
guaranteed access has been understood as a more encom-
passing notion of the freedom of communication system and
is a central principle of diversity.
It is, however, important to note that the market approach
to participatory democracy has measured viewpoint diver-
sity based on media reflection of public demands with little
regard to how their demands fulfill democratic ideals.
However, the public demands are not necessarily equiva-
lent to the public needs in their democratic decisions.
Emphasized earlier, the literature supports that audiences'
demands are popular rather than intellectually diverse.
Thus, measuring political dimension of viewpoint diversity
in participatory democracy should entail the inquiry into
whether citizens' response to or use of media information
(i.e., citizens' participation) through various mediums (i.e.,
access offered by media outlets) affects their public or dem-
ocratic decisions. Considerable research in the communica-
tion field has addressed this diversity inquiry (e.g., Braman,
2007; Dalton, Beck, & Huckfildt, 1998; Gunther, 1992;
Horwitz, 2005; Napoli, 2007; Waldfogel, 2007). The vari-
ables that potentially measure such participatory demo-
cratic function are
·
· Citizen's public competence or knowledge that affects
civic engagement in political issue and public
decision
·
· Citizens' education level that affects information pro-
cessing in terms of political issue
·
· Cultural or demographic aspect, including racial, gen-
der, and age background that affect their participation
in political issue and
·
· How these variables affect their particular use of
mediums and its relevance to democratic decisions.
Diversity of Ownership as a
Separate Goal From Viewpoint Diversity
Developing objective and meaningful metrics of viewpoint
diversity is necessary and should be a primary goal in aca-
demic research because such an effort has its own
10 SAGE Open
intellectual rigor. But, particularly, in times of increased
judicial skepticism about viewpoint diversity and empirical
justifications for regulations, the FCC inevitably faces
methodological challenges. Even if more rigorous and
advanced methodologies of viewpoint are developed within
and across various disciplines, ongoing debate on its con-
ceptual elusiveness and subjectivity is more likely to exist
as a result of the contradictory effects of the economic anti-
trust law on diversity. Dealing in a practical manner, there
seems no greater chance that the FCC would satisfy the
court's critical demand for objective and scientific proof for
establishing the connection between ownership diversity
and viewpoint diversity, thereby continually hindering the
government responsiveness to media's democratic perfor-
mance. If this is the case, an alternative way of countering
such struggle in regulations is setting diversity of ownership
as a separate goal from viewpoint diversity. Put differently,
the FCC may simply make ownership diversity by itself as a
political goal (consideration reflected in the 2002 Biennial
Review). Enforcement of antitrust law, in this way, is pre-
serving democratic values of not content diversity but own-
ership diversity in a First Amendment principle.
The proposition of decentralizing ownership is not a new
concern. Grounded in normative concern, numerous media
scholars have addressed the danger of ownership concentra-
tion. For example, McChesney (1997, 1999) proposed
reform of media structure to affirm the democratic function
of media. He argues that concentrated corporate control is
detrimental to any notion of participatory democracy, yet the
First Amendment has provided an exclusive shield for corpo-
rate media. Croteau (2003, Croteau & Hoynes, 2006)
addressed the potential danger of corporate media power that
undermined democracies deemed in the public interest, thus
the relaxation of ownership would reduce diversity in terms
of quantity and quality. Baker (2009) also provided reasons
for decentralized ownership regardless of the contradictory
effect of antitrust law on viewpoint diversity. The commonly
expressed concerns, addressed by these scholars are that con-
centration of ownership
·
· would reduce quality diversity, journalism, cultural
pluralism in commercial media content;
·
· would hinder informed public participation or distri-
bution of citizens' voices with the democratic public
sphere;
·
· would undermine democratic value of egalitarian
premise in sharing political power;
·
· would lead to demagogic political power, failing to
serve watchdog function.
Implementing diversity of ownership as a separate politi-
cal goal from viewpoint diversity would avoid burdensome
scrutiny as a result of its content neutral restriction. This
approach, while encouraging government responsiveness to
media democracy, may also be less competing against the
courts' interpretation of the First Amendment values than
approving its connection to viewpoint diversity.
Conclusion
Media diversity is central to democracy, through which the
First Amendment is expressed and promoted by specific pol-
icies. In the goal of greater precision of the diversity princi-
ples, and of implications and decisions of the diversity policy,
this article proposed an alternative policy model, acknowl-
edging the social, economic, and political schisms in fulfill-
ing the goal of media diversity. The policy model attempted
to establish the policy objective, that is, creating pluralism of
outlets, ownership, and choices of people to serve democ-
racy, such as diversity of media content to cultivate citizen-
ship. The predicable connection between pluralism and
diversity, in this way, should not be overlooked. The theoreti-
cal underpinning of media diversity proposed in the article
entailed the wider intellectual frames consistent to the public
interest. With the analysis of the integrative function of mar-
ket economics and social values of media diversity and desir-
able outcomes on their own, it attempted to avoid
oversimplification of complexities existing in the concept of
media diversity. Clearly while the empirical analysis of the
economic approach can be appropriate to measuring the plu-
ralistic value of competition, the critical analysis of the social
approach is equally important to assess the democratic value
of media content that can cultivate intellectual activity and
politically informed public body.
The application of diversity policy involves judicial deci-
sions about the constitutionality of proposed rules and regu-
lations. The clarification of regulatory concepts of media
diversity was attempted to understand the FCC's logic to jus-
tify the public interest for preserving the competition of out-
lets and ownership, and diversity of content (i.e., viewpoint
diversity). The major regulatory challenge the FCC has faced
was the failure to establish the substantial connection
between competition and diversity closely connected to
localism. The improvement of the FCC's use of the DI to
measure viewpoint diversity is thus critical to justify the pub-
lic interest rationale. Two regulatory justifications histori-
cally used for achieving diversity goals were the scarcity
rationale and the marketplace of ideas, each of which renders
different applications of legal framework to FirstAmendment
issues. The shift from the scarcity rationale to the market-
place ideas due to the changing media landscape conse-
quently undermined social values of media content while
justifying economic antitrust laws designed to protect own-
ership competition. Hence, the continued validity of the mar-
ketplace of idea for promoting viewpoint diversity is largely
questionable.
The critical analysis of the FCC's periodical review of the
ownership rules and regulations raised important policy
issues, such as the continual decline of media diversity fueled
by deregulation, the challenges in defining regulatory
McCann 11
concepts, left poorly defined, and the limitation of an entire
range of existing economic regulations for promoting demo-
cratic values of viewpoint diversity. The potential revision of
the existing policies precisely responding to these problems
is a key factor in effective policymaking. For that reason, the
article suggested developing a rigorous assessment for mea-
suring viewpoint diversity strengthened by entailing the
complementary function of deliberative and participatory
democracy to ensure substantive and critical content for
rational deliberation, public participation, and citizen
empowerment rather than diversity policies serving as mere
rhetorical tools for justifying market motivation of corporate
media. With the increased attention to the current media
ownership, which is heavily concentrated, the article finally
suggested implementing diversity ownership as a separate
political goal from viewpoint diversity. This attempt may
eschew the recurring problem of equating competition of
ownership with diversity of media content.
