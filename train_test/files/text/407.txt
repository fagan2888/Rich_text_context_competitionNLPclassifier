ABSTRACT
Background The primary objective was to determine the dose­response relation between screen time (television þ computer) and the metabolic
syndrome (MetS) in adolescents.
Methods The study sample included 1803 adolescents (12­19 years) from the 1999­04 US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.
Average daily screen time (combined television, computer and video game use) was self-reported. MetS was defined according to adolescent
criteria linked to the adult criteria of the National Cholesterol Education Program (3 of high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist
circumference, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol).
Results After adjustment for relevant covariates, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for MetS increased in a dose­response manner
(Ptrend
, 0.01) across 1 h/day (1.00, referent), 2 h/day (1.21, 0.54­2.73), 3 h/day (2.16, 0.99­4.74), 4 h/day (1.73, 0.72­4.17) and 5 h/day
(3.07, 1.48­6.34) screen time categories. Physical activity had a minimal impact on the relation between screen time and MetS.
Conclusions Screen time was associated with an increased likelihood of MetS in a dose-dependent manner independent of physical activity.
These findings suggest that lifestyle-based public health interventions for youth should include a specific component aimed at reducing screen
time.

Introduction
The positive relationship between television viewing and
obesity in children and adolescents is well known.1 ­6
Television viewing has also been linked to a number of
other important public health issues in youth including
violent and aggressive acts, initiation of early sexual beha-
viours, body self-image issues and substance use and
abuse.6 Excessive computer and video game use has been
associated with many of the same health and social
problems.6
The negative impact of excessive television and computer
use on the health and well-being of children and youth
prompted the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
Canadian Paediatric Society to establish public health and
clinical guidelines for screen time use (television þ
computer þ video games). The guidelines recommend that
children and adolescents limit screen time to no more than
2 h/day.7,8 Although the influence of screen time on poor
health was well established when the guidelines were devel-
oped, it is not clear how or why the 2-h threshold was
selected. Dose­response studies of screen time and health
are required to verify the appropriateness of this threshold.
Furthermore, from a physical health perspective, obesity was
the primary outcome considered in the development of the
screen time guidelines. There is a need to ascertain the con-
nection between screen time and other pertinent outcomes
such as the metabolic syndrome (MetS). MetS represents a
clustering of cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes risk
factors that predisposes one to several chronic diseases and
premature mortality.9 Clinical criteria for MetS often include
features such as abdominal obesity, high triglycerides, low
HDL cholesterol, high fasting glucose and high blood

pressure.9 Recent estimates suggest that 7.6% of American
adolescents have the MetS,10 with a prevalence of over 30%
in overweight and obese youth.11
It is also not clear if the relationship between screen time
and health is independent of other behaviours that may be
associated with screen time, most notably physical activity
participation. Clarification of the independent effect of
screen time on health has important implications for the
development of interventions aimed at decreasing sedentary
behaviours and increasing physical activity (e.g. should the
intervention focus be placed on one or both behaviours?).
In a large sample of adolescents from the European Youth
Heart Study, television viewing time was correlated to MetS
components, but not the clustered cardiometabolic risk
factor score, after adjustment for physical activity.12 These
results suggest that screen time itself may not be an inde-
pendent predictor of obesity and other cardiometabolic risk
factors. However, the European Youth Heart Study only
considered television time and did not measure other
important components of screen time such as computer
and video game use.
The objectives of this study were to determine if screen
time is related to MetS in adolescents, to examine the dose­
response pattern of that relationship, and to determine if the
relationship between MetS and screen time is independent
of physical activity.
Methods
The study sample consisted of a subgroup of subjects from
the 1999-00, 2001-02 and 2003-04 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). NHANES is a
cross-sectional survey completed in the US population and
identified subjects using a complex, stratified, multistage,
probability sampling design. Participation in the survey was
voluntary. Written informed parental consent and child
assent were obtained from participants under 18 years of
age; written consent was obtained from participants 18 years
and older. The protocol was approved by the National
Center for Health Statistics. The secondary analysis pre-
sented here was approved by the Queen's University Health
Sciences Research Ethics Board.
The eligible NHANES sample for the present study
included those aged 12­19 years who completed both the
home interview and mobile exam centre (MEC) com-
ponents of the survey. Only subjects with complete screen
time, physical activity, demographic, dietary, anthropometric,
blood pressure and fasting blood measures were examined
in the present study (n ¼ 1803). Compared with the total eli-
gible NHANES sample in the same age range (n ¼ 6980),
the study sample comprised a greater proportion of males
(55.7 versus 50.3%), a greater proportion of non-Hispanic
whites (29.9 versus 25.7%) and were slightly older (age
15.7 + 2.2 versus 15.4 + 2.3 years).
Screen time
Screen time included television, video and computer game
use, and was ascertained as part of the physical activity
questionnaire, which was completed in the home interview
or MEC depending on the survey round and age of the par-
ticipant. Subjects reported the number of hours per typical
day in the past 30 days that they watched television (includ-
ing videos) and/or used a computer (including video games
console) during their free time. Response categories included
`none', ` ,1 h', `1 h', `2 h', `3 h', `4 h' and `5 or more
hours'. Screen time categories of `none', ` ,1 h' and `1 h',
representing 24.2% of the study sample, were combined. All
subjects in the 1999/00 survey and those age 16­19 years
in the 2001/02 survey were asked about combined televi-
sion, video and computer use, whereas participants aged
12­15 years in the 2001/02 survey and all subjects in the
2003/04 survey were asked separate questions regarding tel-
evision/video use and computer use. Television/video and
computer time were combined, when necessary, to create an
overall screen time score. Only subjects 16­19 years were
included from the 1999­00 survey due to the inconsistency
of the questions used to obtain screen time behaviours in
12­15 year olds, who reported on the previous day rather
than the previous month.
Metabolic syndrome
Metabolic syndrome criteria
Age- and gender-specific adolescent MetS criteria linked to
the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult
Treatment Panel III criteria were used to define MetS in this
study.10 MetS was defined as having 3 of the following:
high triglycerides, high fasting glucose, high waist circumfer-
ence, high blood pressure and low HDL cholesterol. The
age- and gender-specific thresholds for each MetS com-
ponent were developed using growth curve modelling
whereby the threshold for 12­19 year olds corresponds to
the adult value at 20 years of age on the respective growth
curve.10 Specifically, for each MetS component the gender-
specific percentile score corresponding to the adult cut-point
at exactly 20 years of age was determined. The percentile
values for MetS component were used within each 0.5 year
age grouping to determine which subjects had each specific
MetS component.10 For example, in adults a triglyceride
value of 1.70 mmol/l is used to denote high-risk values.
154 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
This corresponded to the 89th percentile at age 20 in males.
Thus, the 89th percentile at each 0.5 year age grouping for
12­19 year old males was used to denote high triglyceride
values. For a more detailed description of the method used
to define MetS the reader is referred to the paper by Jolliffe
and Janssen.10
Measurement of metabolic syndrome components
Subjects were seated and rested quietly for 5 min before
three blood pressure measures were obtained on the right
arm using a mercury sphygmomanometer. Systolic blood
pressure was recorded at the first Korotkoff sound and dias-
tolic blood pressure was the point of the last audible
Korotkoff sound. Mean blood pressure values were used for
all analyses. Waist circumference was measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm at the level of the iliac crest at the end of a
normal exhalation.13 Fasting blood samples were taken at
the MEC examination. Only subjects who reported fasting
for eight or more hours were included in the analysis. Blood
samples for HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were analysed
at the Johns Hopkins University Lipoprotein Analytical
Laboratory. HDL cholesterol was analysed using the
heparin­manganese precipitation method. Triglycerides
were measured enzymatically in a series of coupled reactions
hydrolysing triglycerides to produce glycerol.14 Samples for
blood glucose were sent to the University of Missouri for
analysis and were assayed using a hexokinase enzyme
method.14 A more detailed description of laboratory pro-
cedures are provided in the NHANES Laboratory
Procedure Manual.14
Covariates
Socio-demographic information
Gender and race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic and others) were considered.
The poverty-to-income ratio was used as a measure of
socioeconomic status and represents the ratio between
family income to the family poverty threshold, which is
based on family size and composition.
Physical activity
Self-reported participation in moderate-to-vigorous intensity
physical activity was obtained during the home interview or
MEC depending on the survey round and age of the partici-
pant. Subjects reported the frequency (number of times in
past 30 days) and average duration (in minutes) per session
for each moderate and vigorous intensity activity they
participated in during the previous 30 days. Activities were
selected from a list with the option to add additional
activities. For each activity, a daily average was calculated by
multiplying the frequency and duration of the activity, and
dividing by 30. Total daily physical activity represents the
sum of all activities. Physical activity categories were created
using the following thresholds: 0­14 min/day, 15­29 min/
day, 30­44 min/day and 45 min/day. Categories were
selected to provide meaningful groups for the interpretation
of results. Because a limited number of subjects (10.6%)
met physical activity guidelines15 of more than 60 min of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per day, a separate
category was not created for this physical activity level. In
youth, questionnaire measures of physical activity are reliable
and modestly correlated (r ¼ 0.40) with objective physical
activity measures obtained by accelerometer,16 although the
questionnaire measures tend to over-estimate physical
activity levels.17
Dietary measures
Subjects were queried and reported on type and amount of
food and beverages consumed during the 24 h prior to the
MEC examination. Results of the dietary recall were used to
estimate the percent of total calories from carbohydrates
and fat. Subjects were separated into three groups for carbo-
hydrate (,40% as low, 40­60% as moderate, .60% as
high) and fat (,30% as low, 30­40% as moderate, .40%
as high) consumption in accordance with dietary
guidelines.18
Statistical analysis
All analyses were completed using Intercooled Stata 7 (Strata
Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) to take into account
the sampling strategy and weighting of the NHANES
survey. An alpha level of P , 0.05 represented statistical
significance.
A `yes' or `no' binary variable for MetS was used as the
dependent variable for the statistical analyses. A x2 test was
used to compare the prevalence of MetS across screen time
categories. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine
the odd ratios for MetS. Initially, bivariate logistic regression
analyses were performed to determine whether the potential
covariates of age, sex, race, socioeconomic status (poverty­
income ratio) and dietary measures were related to MetS. We
then performed logistic regression models to determine
whether categories of screen time, with the 1 h/day
screen time category serving as the reference group (odds
ratio ¼ 1.00), and physical activity, with 45 min/day
serving as the reference group, predicted MetS. Three
models (basic, intermediate and fully adjusted) were con-
sidered in the screen time and physical activity logistic

regression analyses. The basic models considered the bivari-
ate relation between the screen time or physical activity
measure with MetS. The intermediate models considered
the relation between the screen time or physical activity
measure with MetS after controlling for the covariates that
were significant (P  0.05) predictors of MetS. The fully
adjusted model included both screen time and physical
activity measures and controlling for the covariates that were
significant predictors of MetS. The trend of association
across categories of screen time and physical activity were
also tested by repeating the analyses and including the
screen time and physical activity categories as continuous
variables (presented as Ptrend
).
Results
A total of 1803 subjects (1005 males, 798 females) aged
12­19 years from the 1999/00, 2001/02 and 2003/04
NHANES surveys were included in the analyses. Subject
characteristics are presented in Table 1. Only 24.2% of sub-
jects reported screen time values of 2 h or less per day and
met the public health screen time recommendation. The
prevalence of MetS was 5.9% and did not differ between
males and females. Mean values for the individual MetS
component risk factors are also presented in Table 1.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, the prevalence of MetS increased
(P ¼ 0.03) as screen time increased from a low of 3.7% in
the 1 h/day screen time group to a high of 8.4% in the
5 h/day screen time group. These results were consistent
within both genders (Fig. 1).
Age and smoking statuses were the only potential covari-
ates that were significantly related to MetS (Table 2).
Therefore, additional analyses that considered the relation
between screen time and/or physical activity with MetS only
included age and smoking as covariates.

The results of the logistic regression analyses examining
the relation between screen time and MetS are presented in
Table 3. After controlling for the relevant covariates (inter-
mediate model), there was a linear trend for an increased
odds ratio for the MetS across screen time groups (Ptrend
¼
0.005). In comparison with youth in the 1 h/day screen
time group, youth in the 5 h/day screen time group were
3.07 times more likely to have MetS. The inclusion of phys-
ical activity as a covariate in the regression analysis (fully
adjusted model) had little influence on the relationship
between MetS and screen time (Table 3).
Although the pattern of results shown in Table 4 suggests
that physical activity was negatively related to MetS, such
that physically inactive youth were more likely to have MetS
than the most active youth, the relation between physical
activity and MetS did not reach statistical significance in
either the basic or intermediate models. The inclusion of
screen time as a covariate in the regression model had little
influence on the relation between physical activity and MetS
(Table 4, fully adjusted model).
Discussion
Main findings
The primary finding was that the likelihood of having the
MetS increased in a gradient dose­response manner as daily
screen time hours increased, irrespective of physical activity
level. Adolescents reporting screen times of 3 h/day were
approximately two- to threefold more likely to have MetS
than were adolescents with daily screen time levels of 1 h
or less.
What is known already
Screen time has previously been linked to a number of pae-
diatric health determinants and outcomes including obesity
and body-image issues, violent and aggressive behaviours,
early sexual behaviours and substance use and abuse.6 The
results presented here for MetS are consistent with the con-
sensus that excessive screen time negatively impacts the
health and well-being of youth. The strong relation between
excessive screen time and MetS is particularly troubling

SCREEN TIME AND METABOLIC SYNDROME IN ADOLESCENTS 157
given that: (i) 75% of the adolescent participants in this
study had screen time levels of at least 2 h per day; (ii) MetS
and its component risk factors tend to persist from adoles-
cence into adulthood,19,20 (iii) most chronic diseases, such
as cardiovascular disease, are progressive conditions that
start to develop in childhood21,22 and (iv) in adult popu-
lations MetS is a proven risk factor for Type 2 diabetes,23,24
cardiovascular disease23 ­ 25 and all-cause mortality.23,25 On
the basis of these observations, the overall impact of exces-
sive screen time in youth on MetS and resultant health out-
comes is likely to be quite substantive at the population
level.
What this study adds
To our knowledge the present study was the first to examine
the dose­response nature of the relation between screen
time and health. We observed a positive relation between
screen time and MetS, which emphasizes the negative
impact of increasing screen time across the continuum.
However, our results suggest that the public health rec-
ommendation of no more than 2 h of screen time per day7,8
may be somewhat restrictive, at least as the MetS is con-
cerned. The likelihood of having MetS was only increased
by 21% in the 2 h/day screen time group, an amount that
was far from reaching statistical relevance. However, once a
screen time level of 3 h/day was achieved, the likelihood of
the MetS was increased by about twofold, and was clinically
meaningful and of borderline significance (P ¼ 0.06).
The study also sought to determine if the relation
between screen time and MetS was independent of any
potentially confounding influence of physical activity. Our
observation that physical activity had little or no impact on
the relation between screen time and MetS is consistent with
previous findings that physical activity and screen time
behaviours are poorly or unrelated in youth.4,12,26 The fact
that screen time was related to MetS independent of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity raises
questions about the mechanism by which screen time
influences MetS. One possible explanation is that only
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity was
measured, and the lower intensity activities that were not
captured in the NHANES survey were having some unmea-
sured effects. Another possible explanation is that screen
time is more `sedentary' than other sedentary behaviours
(e.g. reading, talking on the phone). One study reported that
energy expenditure in children and youth is lower while they
are watching television than it is while they are at rest.27
Another study found an inverse relation between resting
energy expenditure and weekly hours of television; however,
the same study reported no differences in energy expendi-
ture while resting, watching television and story listening.28
A final explanation is that the time spent watching television
is associated with poor dietary habits such as increased con-
sumption of soft drinks and sweets, and decreased con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables.29 We controlled for the
macronutrient intake of fat and carbohydrates in our ana-
lyses, which suggests that the influence of television on
dietary habits may not account for the influence of screen
time on MetS.
The finding that screen time was an independent predic-
tor of MetS in adolescents differs from a report based on
the European Youth Heart Study in which no relationship
existed between television time and cardiometabolic risk
factors after adjusting for physical activity level.12 Several
methodological differences are likely to account for the dis-
crepancy in results. The European Youth Heart Study only
measured television time, whereas the combined index of
television and computer use employed in our study pro-
vided a more comprehensive measure of screen time beha-
viours. Conversely, our study relied on a self-report measure
of physical activity, which is subject to considerable recall
bias in adolescents,30 whereas the European Youth Heart
Study used accelerometers to obtain an objective measure of
physical activity. Thus, the measures used in our study were
better suited to detect effects of screen time, although the
measures used in the European Youth Heart Study were
better suited to detect effects of physical activity, which is
exactly what these two studies found. Finally, the European
Youth Heart Study examined a cardiometabolic risk score
created by summing age-adjusted z-scores for blood
pressure, skinfolds, glucose, insulin, HDL-C and triglycer-
ides. In comparison, we used adolescent National
Cholesterol Education Program criteria for MetS that relied
on measures of waist circumference, blood pressure,
HDL-C, triglycerides and glucose.10
Strengths and limitations
Key strengths of this study include the use of a representa-
tive study sample and an age-appropriate measure of MetS
for adolescents. The primary study limitation was the cross-
sectional and observational nature, which prevents us from
making causal inferences about the relation between screen
time and MetS. The other main limitation was the self-
reported measures of screen time and physical activity.
Self-reported measures tend to underestimate socially unde-
sirable behaviours (e.g. screen time) and over-estimate
socially desirable behaviours (e.g. physical activity).17
Although socially undesirable activities such as screen time
158 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
are typically under-reported,17 a previous study in youth
found that television time was only underestimated by
0.09 h/week.31 Furthermore, simple questionnaire measures
of television use, such as those obtained in NHANES, are
correlated (r ¼ 0.47) with television time measured by a
detailed log.31 However, because the NHANES screen time
question did not distinguish between days, the validity of the
screen time measure may have been affected since screen
time has been shown to differ between weekdays and
weekend days.31
Conclusions
High screen time was associated with an increased likelihood
of MetS independent of physical activity, diet and other
important covariates. The results suggested that the screen
time guidelines of no more than 2 h/day may be somewhat
restrictive with respect to MetS risk, as the odds ratio for
MetS did not increase notably until 3 h of screen time per
day. The findings of this study also suggest that public
health interventions that target health behaviours in adoles-
cents should include a specific component(s) aimed at redu-
cing screen time. This observation has important public
health and clinical implications and emphasizes the import-
ance of targeting both screen time and physical activity
behaviours for improving the health of youngsters.
Specifically, interventions that are successful at increasing the
physical activity level of young people will not necessarily be
successful at simultaneously decreasing their screen
time.32,33 And because the relation between screen time and
MetS appear to be independent of physical activity, improv-
ing physical activity while maintaining screen time levels is
likely to be far from optimal. Additional studies, particularly
intervention studies, are needed to verify this contention.
