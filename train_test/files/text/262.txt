Abstract
Crop raiding can reduce farmers' tolerance towards wildlife. Despite higher
human population densities in rural areas, and more rapid conversion of forest to
farmland, much less is known about crop raiding in Asia than in Africa. Over
14 months, we identified perceived and actual crop pests, and their patterns of crop
raiding from farmland in and around Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra.
Farmers named either the wild boar Sus scrofa (80%) or the pig-tailed macaque
Macaca nemestrina (20%) as the two most destructive crop pests. From 5125 crop
raids by 11 species of mammal, most raids were indeed made by the wild boar
(56%) and the pig-tailed macaque (19%). For all species combined, temporal crop
raiding peaks were positively correlated with periods of high rainfall. Spatially,
most crop raids occurred nearest to the forest edge and the local guarding
strategies used were ineffective. However, raids by wild boars were more extensive
than raids by pig-tailed macaques, which caused much greater crop damage (73%)
than wild boars (26%), contrary to farmers' perceptions. Our research suggests
that alternative mitigation strategies need to be trialed over dry and rainy seasons
to identify the most effective strategies and that guarding effort should be
increased during the rainy seasons and tailored towards specific crop raiding
species based on their unique spatial patterns.
Introduction
Crop damage caused by raiding wildlife is a prevalent form
of human­wildlife conflict along protected area boundaries
(Naughton-Treves, 1998). The individual economic losses
suffered from crop raiding can be relatively high in develop-
ing countries, because farmers are poor and rarely compen-
sated for their losses (Sekhar, 1998; Rao et al., 2002). Such
losses can make communities antagonistic and intolerant
towards wildlife, which can result in retribution killing of
problem species as well as undermining and impeding
conservation strategies (Nyhus, Tilson & Sumianto, 2000).
However, in order to mitigate this form of human­wildlife
conflict more effectively, it is first necessary to understand
the temporal and spatial factors that predict crop raiding,
and the effectiveness of current guarding strategies (Sitati
et al., 2003; Sitati, Walpole & Leader-Williams, 2005). It is
also necessary to identify correctly those species that cause
the greatest amounts of crop damage, because farmers'
perceptions of the most notorious crop pests may be
influenced by factors other than crop damage (Naughton-
Treves, 1997; Siex & Struhsaker, 1999).
To date, most research on crop damage by wildlife has
been conducted in Africa (Hoare, 1999a; Naughton-Treves,
Rose & Treves, 1999; Hill, Osborn & Plumptre, 2002; Sitati
et al., 2003). Apart from studies of crop raiding by Asian
elephants (Sukumar, 1989; Nyhus et al., 2000), crop raiding
by wildlife has been little studied in Asia (Sekhar, 1998; Rao
et al., 2002), particularly outside India. Yet, rural human
population densities tend to be higher, and clearance of
forest for agriculture is more extensive, in Asia than in
Africa (Achard et al., 2002). In turn, both these factors are
likely to lead to escalating incidents of crop raiding in the
future. Furthermore, case-specific studies are needed from
farmland bordering different habitat types, with different
potential crop pests, as these may also influence crop raiding
patterns and, therefore, the appropriate mitigation strate-
gies (Chiyo et al., 2005; Sitati et al., 2005). Such studies offer
an important insight into the capacity of wildlife to use
agroforest landscapes, which will become increasingly com-
mon in Asia (Nyhus & Tilson, 2004).
The situation around Kerinci Seblat National Park
(KSNP), on Sumatra, Indonesia, illustrates the problem
well: it is a large protected area with extensive tracts of
forest that has been extensively converted around its edges,
and also inside its borders, to farmland by low-income
subsistence farmers. Furthermore, these farmers have strong
perceptions of those species that cause most damage, which
are often targeted through retribution killings (Linkie et al.,
2003; Martyr & Nugraha, 2004).

In this paper, we aim to identify perceived and actual crop
raiding patterns by mammals 45 kg, by investigating (1)
farmers' perceptions of wildlife as crop pests, (2) temporal
patterns of crop raiding by species and by crop type, (3)
spatial patterns of crop raiding by species, (4) extent of crop
destruction by species and (5) perceived versus actual
patterns of crop raiding.
Materials and methods
Study area
The study was conducted in a conglomerate of villages
known as Air Dikit, bordering the southern end of the
13 300 km2 UNESCO World Heritage Site KSNP, in Beng-
kulu province (21560­21640S, 1011430­1011510E). Air Dikit
has an altitudinal range from 100 to 300 m above sea level
that supports a western lowland forest type among the most
threatened habitats in Indonesia (Laumonier, 1994; Holmes,
2001). In Air Dikit, there are still small patches of degraded
forest outside KSNP, but the landscape is dominated by a
farmland mosaic. Air Dikit comprises a single main village
with several diffuse villages, comprising a Muslim transmi-
grant community of Javanese descent. This community
moved in the late 1990s from the adjacent south Sumatra
province, either through a government-sponsored pro-
gramme or spontaneously.
A total of 56 farms, which were between one and four
years old, lay within 2 km of the forest edge within Air Dikit.
Over 14 months, actual and perceived crop raiding patterns
were recorded on 50 farms, after six farmers dropped out. To
avoid raising expectations, farmers were informed from the
outset that this was an academic, not a Department of
Forestry or a conservation NGO, project from which no
financial benefits or compensation would accrue. Of the 50
farms, 40% were previously inside KSNP. However, after the
KSNP boundary was refined by the KS-Integrated Conser-
vation and Development Project in 2002 (World Bank, 2003),
56% of these 50 farms were situated inside KSNP.
Socio-economic backgrounds of farmers,
farmland profiles and perceived crop pests
On each of the 50 farms, family size, ages and education
levels of respondents, and the main types of subsistence and
commercial crops grown were recorded. Semi-structured
interviews were individually administered in Indonesian to
the household heads (all male) of each farm to learn their
perceptions on which factors most limit their agricultural
success, how these factors could be overcome and their
ranking of the two crop pests that worse affected them.
For each farm, we recorded guarding intensity as the
cumulative number of guarding measures used, including
fences, guard dogs, noisemakers, guard huts, guns and fires.
The boundary of each farm was mapped with the owner,
using Garmin 12 global position system (GPS) units (Gar-
min Corp., Ulathe, KA, USA). These data were imported
into ArcView v.3.2 GIS software package (ESRI Inc., Red-
lands, CA, USA) and constructed as a single farmland data
layer, in which each farm was assigned a unique identity
number and its area and perimeter length were calculated.
For each farm, the mean value for the physical features
(proximity to forest edge, proximity to rivers, elevation,
slope, perimeter, and farm size:farm perimeter) was ex-
tracted. Forest cover data were derived from on-screen
digitizing of a radiometrically and geometrically corrected
2002 Landsat 7 ETM+satellite image (path/row, 162/062).
The river data were obtained from 1:50 000 maps produced
by the Indonesian National Coordination Agency for Sur-
veys (1985). The digital elevation model data were obtained
from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and used to
produce the slope layer (Rabus et al., 2003). All spatial data
layers were converted into a raster format within ArcView
and geo-referenced using the UTM 47 s coordinate system
within the WGS84 datum. Finally, rainfall data for the
farmland region over the study period were obtained from
the district rainfall station managed by the Meteorological
and Geophysical Agency of Indonesia.
Crop raiding data collection
Temporal and spatial patterns of crop raiding incidents were
monitored on the 50 farms from November 2001 to Decem-
ber 2002. Participating farmers were trained to use a
calendar to record daily crop raiding incidents by each
species and the crop type damaged during an initial 1-month
pilot study in October 2001. The calendar was then edited
using farmers' comments to improve its ease of use and
encourage their active involvement in compiling data using
the resulting 14-month calendar. One column allowed for
daily entries of crop raiding incidents by nine mammals
45 kg: wild boar Sus scrofa, sambar Cervus unicolor, red
muntjac Muntiacus muntjak, mouse deer (Tragulus sp.),
porcupine Hystrix brachyura, pig-tailed macaque Macaca
nemestrina, long-tailed macaque Macaca fascicularis,
banded langur Presbytis melalophos and sunbear Helarctos
malayanus. Another column allowed daily entries of raids by
other species.
To avoid over-reporting of crop damage by farmers (Siex
& Struhsaker, 1999) and to maintain consistency in the
accuracy and quality of the data collected, three to four
enumerators visited each farm every 2 days throughout the
14 months to check the calendars and verify any conflicting
reports with the farmers by visiting the crops to check the
damage and identify secondary signs, including prints, bite
marks, faeces and hair, associated with the culprit species.
This reduced problems with misreporting of any species that
had only passed through the farmland without crop raiding
(Sitati et al., 2003).
To obtain information on the extent of crop destruction
by the different species, a random subset of the 50 farms was
selected each week over a 5-month period from November
2001 to March 2002. On these farms, the extent of the area
damaged was measured directly in square metres (m2). For
each crop raiding incident, the age of the crop was recorded,
based on its stage of maturity, using the following

1999b).
Data analyses
The farmland profile data and crop raiding data (frequency
and amount of destruction) for wildlife species, both collec-
tively and individually, were imported into SPSS v.11 soft-
ware (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The continuous data
were logarithmically transformed to reduce the likelihood of
extreme results having a disproportionate influence on the
overall dataset.
To identify the perceived crop pests, the percentage of
farmers that ranked each wildlife species as either the first or
second worst pest was calculated. Next, to enable compara-
tive analyses of crop raiding patterns between months with
unequal numbers of days, we calculated the average number
of crop raids per day, referred to hereafter as `monthly crop
raiding frequency'. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient
(rs
) was used to determine whether there was a relationship
between monthly rainfall patterns, either directly or with a
1-month lag period, and monthly crop raiding frequency,
for all wildlife species individually and combined. Spear-
man's rank correlation coefficient was also used to examine
possible relationships between crop types eaten each month
and monthly rainfall patterns.
To investigate spatial patterns of crop raiding, the number
of crop raids on each farm was calculated over 14 months. A
stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was then used to
determine which combination of spatial factors best explained
spatial crop raiding frequency for all wildlife species com-
bined, and for the most frequent crop raiding species indivi-
dually. The factors included in the analysis were based on
previous studies (Naughton-Treves, 1998; Sitati et al., 2005)
and comprised mean proximity to forest edge and to rivers,
elevation, slope, farm size, farm perimeter, farm size:farm
perimeter and guarding measures. The performance of the
model was evaluated by calculating the r2 value, and the
presence of spatial autocorrelation in the model was tested
by calculating Moran's I statistic using Crime-Stat v.1.1
(N. Levine and Associates, Annadale, VA, USA). Correlation
coefficients were used to test for problems with collinearity
(correlations between independent variables).
A Mann­Whitney U-test was performed to determine if
there was any difference in the extent of crop damage
between the two most prolific crop raiding species. Finally,
the relationship between each farmer's perceptions of the
main crop pests and the species that were recorded as crop
raiding most frequently on their farm over 14 months was
determined by performing an independent-samples t-test.
Results
Socio-economic backgrounds of farmers,
farmland profiles and perceived crop pests
The socio-economic backgrounds of farmers differed little
across participating farms. The mean family size for each
household was 3.8Æ 1.8 (SD) people, with a mean age of
22.5Æ 14.1years. Most farmers (71%) had attained a primary
school education level, but only 29% had achieved higher.
The average farm size and perimeter length was
3900 m2 Æ 2300 and 890 m Æ 315, respectively. Farm size was
not correlated with distance to forest edge (n=50, rs
=0.26,
P=0.07). Farmers grew their crops for subsistence (56%)
and commercial (44%) purposes. Among the subsistence
crops edible to wildlife species, all farmers grew rice and
cassava for their main crops, while banana, chili, maize,
papaya, eggplant and water spinach were among the other
subsistence crops. The main commercial crops grown were
coffee (62%), patchouli (18%) or a combination of both
(20%) crops, which are unpalatable to most mammal species.
Most farmers thought that cutting down the forest would
increase flooding (94%), soil erosion (88%) and attacks
from insect crop pests (66%). However, farmers thought
that other factors were more detrimental to their livelihoods,
and that agricultural success was limited by (1) wildlife crop
raiding (90%), (2) a decrease in market prices for cash crops
(43%) and (3) a long distance to the nearest market (37%).
Most farmers (70%) were generally unsure about how they
could overcome wildlife crop raiding, while no farmer stated
retribution killings as a control measure. Some farmers
(30%) thought that guarding their farms might reduce crop
raiding. However, no farms were fenced and only a minority
of farmers employed some form of crop protection (30%),
of which the main strategies were use of a guard dog (24%)
or a gun (6%).
Temporal patterns of crop raiding by wildlife
Over 14 months, farmers compiled a total of 5125 daily
records of crop raiding by 11 mammalian species, compris-
ing wild boar (56%), pig-tailed macaque (19%), red muntjac
(7%), porcupine (6%), sambar (5%), banded langur (4%),
civet (1%) and long-tailed macaque (1%), with sunbear,
tapir and mouse deer (o1%). Wild boar and pig-tailed
macaque were responsible for most (75%) crop raiding
incidents and for all farms combined; these raids comprised
an average of 206.1 and 69.8 daily incidents/month for wild
boar and pig-tailed macaque, respectively. The crop raiding
patterns for all species combined and the main crop pests
individually were strongly seasonal, and most crop raiding
incidents occurred from November to December in both
2001 and 2002 (Fig. 1).
There was a positive correlation between crop raiding
patterns among those mammal species responsible for more
than 5% of the total crop raiding incidents combined and
rainfall (Table 1). However, there was an even stronger
correlation between crop raids by pig-tailed macaque and
rainfall that incorporated a 1-month lag period.
Temporal patterns of crop raiding by crop
type
A total of 19 different crop types was damaged by mammal
species during this study. Porcupine and red muntjac

showed similar raiding patterns for chili bushes and green
beans, as did pig-tailed macaque and wild boar for rice
(Table 2).
Of the different crop types eaten by all wildlife species
combined, only the frequency of raiding on rice crop and
chili crop (with a 1-month lag period) showed a relationship
with rainfall, with more raids during months with greater
rainfall (Table 3).
Spatial patterns of crop raiding
All participating farms experienced crop raiding by mam-
mals (Fig 2a). Farms closest to the forest edge were most
frequently raided by wild boar, pig-tailed macaque and
porcupine individually and by all species combined (Table
4; Fig. 2a­d), while other physical factors or guarding
measures had no effect. The respective regression models
for wild boar, pig-tailed macaque and porcupine individu-
ally and by all species combined were not affected by spatial
autocorrelation (Moran's I=0.01, À0.03, À0.01 and À0.02,
respectively; all P40.05). The spatial patterns of crop raids
showed that pig-tailed macaque raids were not as wide-
spread as wild boar raids (Fig. 2b and c).
Crop destruction by the main crop pests
Over the 5 months from November 2001 to March 2002, the
damage caused during a total of 346 crop raiding forays
encompassed a total crop area of 1421.0 m2. The mean
damage per foray was 4.1 m2 for all mammal species
combined. Wild boar and pig-tailed macaque were respon-
sible for 99% of the damage (Table 5). Pig-tailed macaque
caused significantly more damage (73%) than wild boar
(26%) when crop raiding (n=310, Z=À4.97, U=3116,
Po0.01). Of these 346 crop raiding forays, pig-tailed maca-
que raided 13% of the forays but caused 73% of the
total damage, whereas wild boar raided 76% of the forays
but caused only 26% of the total damage. Overall, each
problem species differed in their preference for crop matur-
ity. Pig-tailed macaque pre-dominantly ate fully grown
crops, which partly explains their greater destructiveness,
while wild boar were the least selective, and ate crops at all
stages of maturity.
Perceived versus actual crop pests
The majority (80%) of farmers named wild boar as the
crop pest that worse affected them, while the remaining
(20%) farmers named pig-tailed macaque. Farmers who
named wild boar were not found to be from farmland that
was raided more frequently by this species (F=2.10,
P=0.15).
Discussion
This study represents an important first step in the mitiga-
tion of crop raiding by wildlife, because it is based on an
explicit understanding of the actual crop pests and their
spatio-temporal patterns of crop raiding. This study quanti-
fied perceived and actual patterns of crop raiding by
different mammal species in and around KSNP, Sumatra.
The most frequent crop raiders among 11 recorded species
of mammal were wild boar and pig-tailed macaque. Most
farmers around the Air Dikit study area thought that crop
raiding was the greatest limitation to their agricultural

success, but most did not know how to mitigate this threat,
and the limited range of guarding strategies used proved to
be ineffective at reducing crop raiding. This study was not
able to assess fully the socio-economic consequences of the
observed patterns of crop raiding, which remains an im-
portant gap in much research on human­wildlife conflict,
even where the topic has been more widely researched
(Conover, 2002). However, determining the spatio-temporal
patterns of crop raiding (Sitati et al., 2003) has proven
sufficient in some areas of Africa to establish trials for
mitigating crop raiding (Sitati & Walpole, 2006).
In the tropics, the temporal relationship between crop
raiding, rainfall and forest fruiting patterns is complex and
poorly understood (Chiyo et al., 2005). However, this study
found strong seasonality in the temporal patterns of crop
raiding for all crop pests combined and for the main pests
individually. Crops were most vulnerable to raiding during
the rainy season. As with elephant crop raiding patterns in
southern Sumatra (Nyhus et al., 2000), the main crop staple
of rice was raided more often in Air Dikit during the wetter
months, when the crop was ripe. In contrast, cassava crops
do not ripen seasonally and were raided throughout the year
without any relation to rainfall patterns, as also shown in
southern Sumatra (Nyhus et al., 2000). This would suggest
that crop raiding patterns in Sumatra may be determined by
the seasonal ripening of nutritious crops rather than by a
scarcity of forest fruit food sources at particular seasons
(Sukumar, 1989; Chiyo et al., 2005), but experiments would
be needed to prove which explanation is correct.
Spatial patterns of crop raiding in the tropics are less
complex and more clearly understood. While Hill (1997)
found that the factors best explaining spatial patterns of
crop raiding varied between different wildlife species in
Uganda, most other studies have found that proximity to
forest edge, or probable surrogates, is the single most
important explanatory factor (Jhala, 1993; Studsrød &
Wegge, 1995; Sekhar, 1998; Hill, 2000; Saj, Sicotte &
Paterson, 2001). In Air Dikit, crop raiding was also mostly
confined to farmland closest to the forest edge, probably
because of the barrier created by the agricultural landscape
(Hoare & du Toit, 1999) and the crop pests' need for a forest
refuge. However, mapping the crop raiding patterns
revealed that wild boar raids were more extensive than
pig-tailed macaque raids.
The patterns of crop raiding by pig-tailed macaques
appear similar to those of African elephants in that they
were not widespread and inflicted relatively large losses on
farmers (Sitati et al., 2003). Being a frugivore, pig-tailed
macaques predominantly raided mature fruit crops (papaya
and banana). Crop raids on mature rice crops, which were
grown in all farms, may have allowed pig-tailed macaques to
increase their foraging efficiency by reducing the amount of
time spent travelling to different food sources. In contrast to
pig-tailed macaque crop raiding patterns, wild boars entered
farms more frequently to raid crops, but caused significantly
less damage, both per foray and overall. This was probably
due to the wild boar's catholic diet, as reflected by its
targeting crops at all stages of maturity. If this study had
included crop raiding by small animals (birds, rodents and
insects) then crop raiding would probably have been much
more extensive and destructive (Naughton-Treves & Treves,
2005).
Farmers' perceptions of the damage caused by different
crop pest species could include metrics such as economic
value (e.g. average quality of the crop damaged and
time invested in cultivating the crop) and opportunity costs
(e.g. children not attending school to guard family farms
instead), as well as the frequency and extent of raiding
and maturity of crop damage measured in this study.
Therefore farmers' perceptions of damage and our measure
of the extent of damage may not be strictly comparable.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that the farmers
in Air Dikit perceived the wild boar to be the crop pest
that worse affected them, but this did not correspond with
the observed patterns of crop damage on their farm. The

difference in the perceived and the recorded crop pests
illustrates a need to investigate community perceptions
associated with crop damage (Siex & Struhsaker, 1999). In
comparison with the pig-tailed macaque, the propensity of
the wild boar to raid crops more frequently and to raid more
staple crops may have led farmers to describe wild boar as
the worst crop pest in Air Dikit, despite the fact that pig-
tailed macaques caused more damage overall. In contrast,
research from Uganda found that olive baboons Papio
cynocephalus, which caused the most cumulative damage,
were considered by farmers as worse crop pests than red-
tailed monkeys Cercopithecus ascanius, which raided most
frequently (Naughton-Treves, 1997). Wild boars may also
have received a disproportionate amount of the blame for
crop damage because they were more conspicuous as a
consequence of their frequent and widespread raiding.
Similarly in Zanzibar, negative attitudes toward red colobus
monkeys Procolobus kirkii may have been linked to farmers
wrongly accusing these monkeys of damaging bananas,
which was actually caused by the smaller and less conspic-
uous Sykes monkeys Cercopithecus mitis that often inter-
mingle with red colobus monkeys. The farmers' main
complaint was on the negative impact of red colobus
monkey coconut consumption, but this species actually
foraged on immature coconuts, which were actually asso-
ciated with higher harvests, possibly due to a pruning effect
(Siex & Struhsaker, 1999).
The few guarding measures used in Air Dikit were
ineffective in reducing crop raiding, although by using them
farmers presumably perceived them as having some

Patterns and perceptions of wildlife crop raiding in Sumatra M. Linkie et al.
potential. Alternative guarding methods that might be
trialed in conjunction with farmers include thorny shrub
fences to prevent wild boar raids, or chili grease fences that
have successfully excluded African elephants from maize
fields (Sitati & Walpole, 2006). The destructive pig-tailed
macaques present a more intractable problem, but commu-
nal guarding by farmers, which is not currently practised in
Air Dikit, may minimize their crop raiding, especially
during the rainy season. Trialing such alternative strategies
over a subsequent 14-month period would enable an evalua-
tion of their effectiveness in reducing crop raiding (Sitati &
Walpole, 2006). More general initiatives that target all crop
pests could include the planting of edible crops (e.g. rice and
cassava) further from the forest edge and in areas where they
could be better guarded.
Human settlements bordering protected areas in Sumatra
receive no tangible legal benefits from living with destructive
wildlife, either through tourism (Walpole & Thouless, 2005)
or through extractive use (Leader-Williams & Hutton,
2005). However, the unsanctioned hunting of crop pests as
prized game can be an effective defence strategy that can
provide, at least, some direct community benefits (Naugh-
ton-Treves, 1998; Lee, 2000). Retribution killings of wildlife
do occur in farmland around KSNP, as intolerant farmers
set snare traps, which indiscriminately trap wildlife, includ-
ing tigers (Martyr & Nugraha, 2004). However, there
appears little killing, consumption or sale of crop raiding
pig-tailed macaques and wild boars, both of which are
considered `unclean' by Muslim farmers.
Critically, this study highlights an enduring problem
facing KSNP management, because the farms most heavily
raided were illegal settlements inside the KSNP boundary
(Fig. 2). While all farmers interviewed claimed not to know
that their farm was inside KSNP, most (82%) farmers were
unaware of restrictions on opening up new farmland (Lin-
kie, 2003). Thus, the KSNP boundary needs to be enforced
more vigorously to reduce farmland encroachment. At the
same time, this needs to be coupled with improved mitiga-
tion of human­wildlife conflict to reduce farmer hostility
towards wildlife, particularly of threatened species.
