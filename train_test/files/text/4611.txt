Abstract: The relative lengths of the 2nd and 4th digits (2D:4D) is a negative biomarker for
prenatal testosterone, and low 2D:4D may be associated with aggression. However, the
evidence for a 2D:4D-aggression association is mixed. Here we test the hypothesis that
2D:4D is robustly linked to aggression in "challenge" situations in which testosterone is
increased. Participants were exposed to an aggressive video and a control video.
Aggression was measured after each video and salivary free testosterone levels before and
after each video. Compared to the control video, the aggressive video was associated with
raised aggression responses and a marginally significant increase in testosterone. Left
2D:4D was negatively correlated with aggression after the aggressive video and the
strength of the correlation was higher in those participants who showed the greatest
increases in testosterone. Left 2D:4D was also negatively correlated to the difference
between aggression scores in the aggressive and control conditions. The control video did
not influence testosterone concentrations and there were no associations between 2D:4D
and aggression. We conclude that 2D:4D moderates the impact of an aggressive stimulus
on aggression, such that an increase in testosterone resulting from a "challenge" is
associated with a negative correlation between 2D:4D and aggression.

Introduction
The relative lengths of the 2nd and 4th digits (2D:4D) is a sexually dimorphic trait in
which males tend to have longer 4th digits relative to 2nd digits than do females (Manning,
Scutt, Wilson, and Lewis-Jones, 1998). It has been hypothesized that 2D:4D is a biomarker
for prenatal testosterone (PT) and prenatal estrogen (PE) such that 2D:4D is negatively
correlated to PT and positively correlated to PE (Manning, 2002, 2011; Manning et al.,
1998). The evidence for this hypothesis has been reported in both correlational and
experimental studies. With regard to the former, individuals with congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (a trait associated with high prenatal androgen) tend to have low
"masculinized" 2D:4D (for meta-analysis, see Hönekopp and Watson, 2010). In contrast,
Klinefelter's men (individuals with XXY sex chromosomes), who have low prenatal
testosterone, show high "feminized" 2D:4D (Manning et al., 2013). In addition, XY
individuals who are partly or completely insensitive to androgen have mean 2D:4D that is
similar to that of females (Berenbaum, Bryk, Nowak, Quigley, and Moffat, 2009). With
regard to experimental evidence, in rodents the administration of in utero testosterone or
the blocking of estrogen receptors has been shown to lower 2D:4D, whereas administration
of estrogen or blocking androgen receptors increases 2D:4D (Talarovicova, Krskova, and
Blazekova, 2009; Zheng and Cohn, 2011). Further examination of these and related data
suggests that 2D:4D is fixed in a narrow prenatal window of development and is linked to
the activation of "skeletogenic" genes by sex steroids. The skeletogenic genes, some 20 in
number, have multiple additional functions which include the morphogenesis of the
reproductive organs and the brain (Lawrance-Owen, Bargary, Bosten, Goodbourn, and
Hogg, 2013; Zheng and Cohn, 2011)
These findings provide compelling evidence that 2D:4D is negatively related to PT
and positively related to PE, such that it reflects both sensitivity to sex steroids and the
concentration of prenatal sex steroids (Manning, 2011). However, there remains a debate
on whether small gradations in 2D:4D are closely correlated to individual levels of PT and
PE. For instance, Hampson and Sankar (2012) suggested that the correlation between
2D:4D and sensitivity to testosterone is not substantial, whereas Van Honk and colleagues
have reported that very small gradations in 2D:4D strongly moderates the influence of
experimentally-administered testosterone on empathy (van Honk et al., 2011), co-operation
(van Honk, Montoya, Bos, van Vugt, and Terburg, 2012), and moral judgments (Montoya
et al., 2013) in women. To our knowledge, no experiment has been undertaken to examine
the relationship between 2D:4D and aggression in men and, in particular, whether this
relationship may be explained by fluctuating testosterone levels.
Aggression in humans is strongly sex dependent, such that men tend to show more
same-sex physical aggression compared to women (e.g., Campbell and Muncer, 2008).
Therefore, this would suggest that 2D:4D is negatively related to physical aggression.
However, such a relationship is controversial. The first examination of the association
reported that 2D:4D did not correlate with aggression (Austin, Manning, McInroy, and
Mathews, 2002). Subsequent studies have reported both significant and non-significant
findings in links between 2D:4D and aggression. For example, Hurd, Vaillancourt, and
Dinsdale (2011) found a significant negative relationship between 2D:4D and physical
2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone

aggression in a sample of Canadian men, but Butovskaya et al. (2012) reported no
association between 2D:4D and physical aggression in a sample of Hadza men. A recent
meta-analysis (Hönekopp and Watson, 2011) has not resolved these differences, reporting
only a small but significant, negative relationship between 2D:4D and aggression in men
(r = -0.06). These discrepancies in the literature concerning 2D:4D and aggression in men
may be resolved, to some extent, if aggression is influenced by testosterone induced by an
aggressive challenge and such influence is additionally moderated by 2D:4D.
There is evidence for an aggression-testosterone-2D:4D link in the presence of a
challenge. Millet and Dewitte (2007) reported no relationship between 2D:4D and physical
or provoked aggression in a sample of 45 men, but a significant negative correlation with
both physical and provoked aggression, and 2D:4D was noted immediately after exposure
to an aggressive video. Although testosterone was not measured in this study, there are
reports of increases in testosterone after watching an aggressive video clip (e.g., Cook and
Crewther, 2012; also see Millet, 2010 for general discussion of the link between aggressive
stimuli and testosterone production), which, in turn, may influence the expression of such
behaviors as aggression. Furthermore, a study of Italian football players in "Series A"
showed low 2D:4D and high testosterone were linked to the number of fouls during games
(Perciavalle et al., 2013). This correlation is to be expected if low 2D:4D predicts high
physical aggression during the challenge of a competitive game of football. Therefore,
studies that address any association between 2D:4D and aggression would benefit from
experimentally manipulating testosterone levels using a "challenge" stimulus such as an
aggressive video.
In this study, we examined the relationship between 2D:4D, testosterone
responsiveness, and provoked aggression in men in relation to an aggressive video
stimulus. We manipulated testosterone levels by exposing the participants to an aggressive
challenge video and also a control video. Aggression was measured after each video and
free testosterone was measured before and after exposure to each video. Our working
hypothesis was that the aggressive video would raise testosterone levels and, in this
context, 2D:4D would be negatively related to aggression. In contrast, we expected
testosterone would not be raised by the control video and, in this context, 2D:4D would not
be associated with aggression.
Materials and Methods
We broadly followed the protocol of Millet and Dewitte (2007) and considered their
measure of provoked aggression as the outcome variable.
Participants
Participants were recruited from male students and staff of a UK University. The
sample (as in Millet and Dewitte, 2007) comprised 45 Caucasian men with a mean age of
24.27 (SD = 7.72) years. Most participants were from the UK. Each participant had the
protocols explained to them and signed informed consent before the study commenced.
Ethical approval was provided by a local University Ethics Committee.

Protocols
A randomized experimental study with a cross-over design was used to address the
study's hypotheses. All participants were assessed between the hours of 10am and 4pm,
with subsequent assessments made at the same time of day for each individual. After
arriving at the testing facility, each participant was asked to provide a saliva sample and
was then exposed to either an aggressive video (a rugby haka plus rugby tackles) or a
control video (a blank screen), both of which had a duration of 4 minutes. A haka is a
ritualized display which is a traditional war dance or challenge of the Maori people. It is
performed before national New Zealand rugby matches. Our recent work demonstrated an
acute rise in free testosterone levels with this type of aggressive stimulus (Cook and
Crewther, 2012). We checked the effectiveness of the manipulation in each participant by
asking: (i) "To what extent has physical aggression been shown in the video?" and (ii)
"How aggressive does this video look in general?" Both questions were scored out of 100
for effectiveness (0 = not effective; 100 = highly effective). A second saliva sample was
collected 15 minutes after exposure to the video to coincide with the testosterone surges
reported elsewhere (Cook and Crewther, 2012). Due to experimental constraints, the videos
were shown on a large video screen and presented to participants in small groups (1-4).
There were no interactions between participants while watching the video footage, or
during the short period after, to ensure minimal effects of the social environment on the
hormonal and behaviour measures. The aggressive video was watched without any sound.
After viewing the aggressive or control video, the participants were presented with
five situations from the aggression provocation questionnaire used by Millet and Dewitte
(2007). For each situation, participants were asked to rate on a five-point Likert scale (1
being lowest, 5 being highest) how angry, irritated, and frustrated they would feel in each
situation. The testing procedure was repeated, after a period of approximately one week,
when the participant was exposed to whichever video they previously had not seen.
2D:4D assessment
At the completion of the first video exposure, the ventral surface of the participant's
hands was photocopied. In order to minimize possible distortion of the fingertips by
pressure on the glass plate of the photocopier, all participants were asked to gently place
their hand on the glass plate. All photocopies were checked to ensure the finger tips were
not flattened and that the finger creases were clearly displayed. Measurement of finger
length was from the finger crease proximal to the palm to the tip of the finger using vernier
calipers measuring to 0.01 mm (Manning et al., 1998).
Saliva collection and hormone analysis
Saliva was collected by passive drool into sterile containers, approximately 2 ml
over a timed collection period of 2 minutes. The samples were subsequently stored at -30°
C until assay. After thawing and centrifugation (2000 rpm x 10 minutes), the saliva samples
were analyzed in duplicate for testosterone concentrations using commercial kits
(Salimetrics LLC, USA) and the manufacturers' guidelines. The minimum detection limit
for the T assay was 6.1 pg/ml, with inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) of < 9.7%.

Results
The repeatability (ICC) of the first and second measurement of 2D:4D was high and
significant for both hands (right hand: ICC = 0.93, F = 26.82, p = 0.0001; left hand: ICC =
0.93, F = 28.58, p = 0.0001). Therefore, the between-individual differences in 2D:4D were
significantly greater than measurement error. Mean 2D:4D was calculated for right (0.949
[0.021]) and left (0.953 [0.027]) hands and used in subsequent analyses.
Considering the manipulation, we calculated a mean of the two manipulation
checks. Ratings for aggressive content were high for the aggressive video (79.87[11.67])
and very low for the control video (0.91 [1.55]). The difference was significant, t(45) =
43.58, p = 0.0001.
With regard to the aggression provocation questionnaire, we calculated a composite
score for provoked aggressive tendency after the aggressive video and after the control
video (PAT: aggressive video condition PATaggress
= 60.09 [5.52]; control PATcontrol
= 54.52
[9.41]). The former was significantly higher than the latter, t(45) = 5.61, p = 0.0003.
Considering the testosterone levels associated with the aggressive video, mean
testosterone was higher after the video (156.92 [59.45] pg/ml) in comparison to before the
video (144.63 [51.11] pg/ml). The magnitude of the increase (12.30 pg/ml) was marginally
significant (one-sample t-test mean set at zero, t = 1.81, p = 0.08).
In contrast to the aggressive video, the testosterone levels associated with the
control video were slightly higher before (166.73 [72.13] pg/ml) compared to after the
video (163.27 [60.13] pg/ml). The magnitude of the change was not significant (one-
sample t-test mean set at zero, t = 0.59, p = 0.56).
Manipulation effects and provoked aggression tendency
The perceived magnitude of aggression reported in the manipulation check did not
correlate with PATaggress
(r = 0.19, p = 0.21). Also the difference between the manipulation
score for the aggressive and control conditions did not correlate with the difference in
PATaggress
- PATcontrol
(r = 0.02, p = 0.88).
Digit ratio, testosterone and provoked aggression tendency
With regard to the aggressive video condition, 2D:4D was negatively related to
PATaggress
, and this was significant for left 2D:4D (r = -0.31, p = 0.04; see Figure 1) but not
right 2D:4D (r = -0.23, p = 0.13). We checked this finding by applying a more conservative
test for correlation, i.e., the Spearman correlation test, and again found a significant
association for left 2D:4D (rs
= -0.32, z = 2.13, p = 0.03) but not right 2D:4D (rs
= -0.22, z
= 1.46, p = 0.14). There were no associations between testosterone and PATaggress
(testosterone before video: r = 0.08, p = 0.59; testosterone after video: r = 0.001, p = 0.99;
testosterone after video ­ testosterone before video: r = 0.02, p = 0.88).
We considered the relationship between left 2D:4D, PATaggress
, and testosterone
further by performing a multiple regression analysis with dependent variable PATaggress
and
independent variables left 2D:4D, change in testosterone (testosterone after video ­
testosterone before video), and the interaction between left 2D:4D and change in
testosterone. We found that left 2D:4D was no longer significantly related to PATaggress
2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone

(b = -37.03, t = 1.21, p = 0.24). However, the change in testosterone was now positively
related to PATaggress
(b = 1.68, t = 2.24, p = 0.03), and there was a significant negative
relationship for left 2D:4D*change in testosterone (b = -1.77, t = 2.25, p = 0.03). For right
2D:4D, there was no significant relationship with PATaggress
(b = -55.74, t = 1.38, p = 0.18),
change in testosterone (b = 0.45, t = 0.37, p = 0.72), or the interaction right 2D:4D*change
in testosterone (b = -0.48, t = 0.37, p = 0.71).

In order to focus on the interaction left 2D:4D*change in testosterone, we
calculated a median split in the magnitude of the testosterone change (low: n = 22, mean
change = -19.50 [25.42] pg/ml; high: n = 23, mean change = 42.71[39.50] pg/ml). The
relationship between left 2D:4D and PATaggress
in the low change group was positive and
weak (r = 0.11, p = 0.61), but in the high change group it was a strong and significant
negative association (r = -0.53, p = 0.009; see Figure 2). A similar pattern was found using
a Spearman correlation test (low change: rs
= -0.09, z = 0.04, p = 0.97; high change: rs
=
-0.50, z = 2.34, p = 0.02). Considering the control video condition, correlations between
2D:4D and PATcontrol
tended to be positive but non-significant (left 2D:4D: r = 0.12, p =
0.46; right 2D:4D: r = 0.18, p = 0.26). With regard to testosterone, there were no
significant associations with PATcontrol
(testosterone before video: r = 0.01, p = 0.51;
testosterone after video: r = 0.03, p = 0.85; testosterone after video ­ testosterone before
video: r = -0.14, p = 0.36).
With regard to comparisons between the aggressive and control video conditions,
considering differences between PATaggress
and PATcontrol
, left 2D:4D was negatively and
significantly correlated with PATaggress
-PATcontrol
(r = -0.36, p = 0.02; see Figure 3), and
right 2D:4D was negatively but non-significantly correlated with PATaggress
-PATcontrol

0.26, p = 0.09). In this instance, Spearman correlation tests showed that both left 2D:4D
and right 2D:4D were significantly negatively related to PATaggress
-PATcontrol
(left 2D:4D:
rs
= -0.34, z = 2.26, p = 0.02; right 2D:4D: rs

Discussion
This study gave the following key results: (i) With regard to the aggressive video,
this was associated with a marginally significant increase in testosterone levels. In addition,
aggression levels were significantly greater after the aggressive video compared to after the
control video (i.e., PATaggress
> PATcontrol
). Left 2D:4D was significantly and negatively
correlated to PATaggress
(product-moment and Spearman correlations). A multiple
regression showed testosterone increase was positively related to PATaggress
and there was a
significant interaction of left 2D:4D*change in testosterone. Considering a median split of
testosterone change, we found that among individuals with increased testosterone there was
a strong negative correlation between left 2D:4D and PATaggress
(product-moment and
Spearman correlations) (ii) The control video did not have any impact on testosterone
levels. There were no significant correlations between left and right 2D:4D and PATcontrol
.
(iii) Considering differences between the aggressive and control conditions, left 2D:4D
(product-moment and Spearman correlations) and right 2D:4D (Spearman correlation only)
correlated negatively with the difference between PATaggress
and PATcontrol
.
Our results replicate those of Millet and Dewitte (2007), in that we found a
significant negative correlation between 2D:4D and aggression after an aggressive
stimulus. The effect was related to an increase in testosterone concentrations, insofar as it
was greatest in the sub-group that showed the greatest increase in testosterone. This
suggests that low 2D:4D men are likely to show high aggression in conditions of challenge
(such as aggressive encounters, including aggressive sports), which is consistent with the
challenge hypothesis. Most of the significant associations we found were for left 2D:4D. In
general, 2D:4D correlations with target traits tend to be strongest for right 2D:4D.
However, for links with sports performance the left 2D:4D is of equal importance
(Hönekopp and Schuster, 2010). Performance in sports involves a challenge which may be
similar to an aggressive situation. This may explain the link with left 2D:4D and aggression
in our findings. There was no correlation between 2D:4D and aggression after the control
video. This suggests that in the absence of an aggressive challenge a low 2D:4D is not a
strong biomarker for aggression. Thus, with regard to the relationship between 2D:4D and
aggression, it is possible to see negative or null correlations, as have been reported by Hurd
et al. (2010) and Butovskaya et al. (2012). The former is likely if most of the study
participants have recently been exposed to a challenge, whereas the latter is likely if there
was no preceding challenge in most participants.
The finding of a link between low 2D:4D and aggression in challenge conditions
may be explained by two underlying mechanisms:
Firstly: 2D:4D and sensitivity to testosterone. Low 2D:4D is thought to be a marker
for testosterone levels in the fetus and also sensitivity to testosterone in the fetus and adult.
Therefore, a spike in testosterone may lead to an increase in aggression, and this would be
particularly seen in low 2D:4D men. Is low 2D:4D linked to high sensitivity to
testosterone? Sensitivity to testosterone is partly dependent on allelic variation in the
androgen receptor gene (AR). Within the terminal domain of the AR is a polymorphic
region with a variable number of CAG repeats. Low CAGn is associated with high
sensitivity to testosterone. Therefore, spikes in testosterone may elicit a greater effect in
2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(5). 2013. -961-
those individuals with low CAGn, and in men with low 2D:4D if the latter is linked to low
CAGn. However, the correlational evidence for a link between low 2D:4D and low CAGn
is mixed. The prediction is that 2D:4D is positively correlated with CAGn. With regard to
studies of aggression, a positive association between 2D:4D and CAGn was found for left
hand 2D:4D (significant, p = 0.01) and right hand 2D:4D (marginally significant, p = 0.08)
by Butovskaya et al. (2012), but not by Hurd et al. (2011). Regarding general population
samples, Manning, Bundred, Newton, and Flanagan (2003) reported a significant positive
relationship between right 2D:4D (p = 0.04) and right-left 2D:4D (p = 0.01) and CAGn in
men. Loehlin, Medland, and Martin (2012) failed to replicate this, but did report a
significant positive relationship between left 2D:4D and CAGn (p = 0.04) in women.
Knickmeyer, Woolson, Hamer, Konneker, and Gilmore (2011), as well as Hampson and
Sankar (2012), reported no association between low 2D:4D and low CAGn. However, the
former found that high neonatal testosterone levels plus low CAGn in infants together
predicted low 2D:4D, whereas the latter reported no interaction between testosterone and
CAGn in adults. Finally, Folland, McCauley, Phypers, Hanson, and Mastana (2012)
reported positive but non-significant associations between 2D:4D and CAGn in left and
right hands. It is important to note that all these studies are correlational in nature.
However, three experimental studies have shown that 2D:4D is a marker for subtle
variations in sensitivity to testosterone, with the digit ratio found to be a strong modulator
of the effect of administered testosterone on empathy (van Honk et al., 2011), cooperation
(van Honk et al., 2012), and moral judgments (Montoya et al., 2013).
Secondly: 2D:4D, challenge and testosterone production. There is little evidence to
support the view that 2D:4D is correlated with circulating levels of testosterone in general
population samples (e.g., Muller et al., 2011). However, 2D:4D may predict testosterone
production immediately after a "challenge." For example, Kilduff et al. (2013) have
reported that low right 2D:4D (relative to left 2D:4D) predicts high testosterone production
after a physical challenge (a repeated sprint test). In the sporting domain, there have been a
number of reports of links between low 2D:4D and high performance in men (e.g., football:
Manning and Taylor, 2001; rowing: Longman, Stock, and Wells, 2011; rugby: Bennett,
Manning, Cook, and Kilduff, 2010). We suggest that under challenge, men with low 2D:4D
show a combination of sensitivity to testosterone and a tendency to produce high levels of
testosterone. This combination may underlie the behavioral and physiological attributes
(such as high aggression and VO2max; see Hill, Simpson, Millet, Manning, and Kilduff,
2012) associated with sports success. Further work may show that, under challenge, 2D:4D
is a powerful predictor of abilities that are useful in aggressive and sports contests and
dominance behaviors. These may include visuo-spatial perception and judgment of the
emotional state of opponents.
In conclusion, we have found an aggressive video was associated with raised
aggression responses and marginally significant increases in testosterone. Left hand 2D:4D
was negatively correlated with aggression after the aggressive video and this correlation
was stronger in those participants with the highest increase in testosterone. Left 2D:4D was
also negatively correlated to the difference between aggression scores in the aggressive and
control conditions, such that participants with high aggression in the former compared to
the latter also had low 2D:4D. We conclude that 2D:4D moderates the impact of an
2D:4D, aggression, and testosterone

aggressive stimulus on aggression, such that an increase in testosterone is associated with a
negative correlation between 2D:4D and aggression.
