Introduction
The coast is a dynamic environment, varying both spa-
tially and temporally. The shoreline is constantly exposed
to a wide range of erosional processes which are a cumu-
lative effect of the various agents of denudation. Erosion
is a naturally occurring phenomenon on the coast which
can be long term, short term or occasional and is attrib-
uted to factors such as rise in sea level, loss of sediment
supply (regional changes), change in the wave character-
istics and change in littoral drift by coastal structures
(local changes). The direct consequences of shoreline ero-
sion are mostly felt by the human beings inhabiting these
regions, highlighting the need for shore stabilization
strategies. Hence, from the perspective of coastal erosion
studies, delineation of shoreline is a pertinent exercise to
study the changes that have taken place over a wider tem-
poral scale. In this regard, remote sensing (RS) and

Abstract
The effect of seawall on the adjacent beaches and coastal dynamics has not been well documented in literature. The
purpose and function of coastal structures, especially seawalls, have often been misunderstood, as in some cases, seawalls
lead to coastal erosion, contrary to protecting the shoreline for which they are generally constructed. Seawalls have
been reportedly causing changes in the near-shore process, specifically the sediment dynamics by affecting the onshore/
offshore and, to some extent, the longshore sand transport. Therefore, it becomes imperative to understand the effect
of seawalls on the adjoining beach to make sure more informed decisions are made on their installation. This article
discusses the effects of seawall construction along the coast of Fansa, South Gujarat, India. A numerical model has
been used to estimate the wave parameters along the selected coast, the results of which are subsequently utilized in
an analytical model (parabolic shape model) to predict the end-wall effect. Independently, remote sensing datasets of
CARTOSAT 1 with spatial resolution of 2.5
m are used to understand the shoreline change dynamics in this region,
post-construction of this seawall. It is found empirically that the net longshore sediment transport rate is approximately
1.9Mm3 per year along the coast. The results of the analytical model predict a maximum landward erosion of about 20m
and an alongshore erosion of 200m on the down-drift side of the seawall. These estimations agree with those obtained
by the remote sensing­based analysis, which estimates an erosion of approximately 40m by the year 2014.

geographical information systems (GIS) can play an
important role to provide valuable information with rea-
sonable accuracy by analysing the differences in past and
present shoreline locations.
In India, several researchers have studied shoreline
changes using a combination of RS and GIS. Misra and
Balaji (2015) studied the decadal shoreline changes along
the South Gujarat Coast. Murali et al. (2015) studied the
decadal changes in shoreline using Landsat and IRS P6
data for the coast of central Odisha, India. A monitoring of
the shoreline changes along the Gulf of Khambat from
1966­2004 using RESOURCESAT-1 LISS-III was carried
out by Gupta (2014). Sheik and Chandrasekar (2011) ana-
lysed the shoreline changes along the coast of Kanyakumari
and Tuticorin using the digital shoreline analysis system
(DSAS). Similarly, a number of studies have been carried
out for various other coastal regions that highlight the
accretion and erosion patterns of the coastline using tem-
poral imagery (Choudhary et al., 2013; Kumar and
Jayappa, 2009; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2011).
In most cases, RS-based studies evaluate the amount of
erosion that has taken place in the various coastal areas
over a given span of time. However, a comprehensive
approach to coastal management often includes a proposal
of solutions that helps to either prevent or stall further ero-
sion of the shorelines. These solutions are broadly classi-
fied as (1) hard stabilization, (2) soft stabilization and (3)
retreat/relocation (Pilkey and Wright III, 1988). Hard stabi-
lization refers to any permanent hard structures such as sea-
walls, detached breakwaters, groins and bulkheads (Kraus,
1988) with a fixed location; soft stabilization refers to
beach replenishment (beach nourishments); and retreat/
relocation refers to the relocation of people from the place
to allow for the natural process of recovery for the beach
(Pilkey and Wright III, 1988). The traditional response to
the shoreline erosion problem is hard stabilization method
which helps to manage and protect the upland property and
structures. However, in several cases, it has been observed
that these methods could result in adverse effects by accel-
erating the shoreline changes. Several researchers have dis-
cussed (Hall and Pilkey, 1991; Pilkey and Wright III, 1988)
the potential effects of the shoreline-stabilizing hard struc-
tures on beaches, and the beach degradation mechanisms
are further classified as (1) placement loss, (2) passive ero-
sion and (3) active erosion. The percentage of success of
any permanent structure is highly variable depending on
the quality of design, coastal climate, storm history and
other factors. Among the various types of structural
defences, seawalls are generally the most commonly used
alternatives, especially in developing nations like India.
Seawall and its influence on the beach
Seawall is a parallel structure constructed along the coast-
line to prevent any loss or inundation of the landward side
by flooding and wave actions. Different types of seawalls
are used depending on the site conditions, such as gravity
walls, rubble mound walls, stone revetment, stepped face,
curved face (concave), combination of stepped and curved
face, and filled gravity.
Although seawalls are a form of structural defence to
control shoreline erosion, however, in many cases, they
are reported to aggravate the problem by causing either
active or passive erosion of the beach. According to
Jayappa et al. (2003), seawalls damage beaches more
rapidly than groins. Several researchers have studied the
effects of seawalls constructed along the various coastal
regions of India (Bhattacharya et al., 2003; Hegde, 2010;
Jayappa et al., 2003; Kumar and Ravinesh, 2011; Mani,
2001; Neelamani and Sundaravadivelu, 2006), and in
most of the literature, it is suggested that seawalls have
either underperformed or failed in the protecting the
affected coastline.
Beach response
Seawall constructed at a particular location along the
shoreline alters the hydrodynamic conditions on interac-
tion with the predominant waves. Such interactions influ-
ence the beach sediment transport that leads to change in
morphology (Griggs and Tait, 1988). Beach response is
majorly divided into two: (1) frontal effects and (2) end
effects. Wave reflection and intensification of lateral long-
shore currents causes removal of beach causing frontal
effects (CERC, US Army, 1984). Furthermore, by prevent-
ing erosion, seawalls cut off the local sediment supply
while waves that hit the wall are reflected downward,
scouring the toe of the wall (Pilkey and Cooper, 2012)
which is referred to as end effects. This study focuses
on the end-wall effect or flanking, that is, the erosion of
the unprotected beach adjacent to the end of the wall
(Tait and Griggs, 1991).
End scour/flanking
End scour, commonly known as end-wall effect or flank-
ing at the down-drift end of the seawall, is recognised as
one of the negative effects associated with seawalls. It is
the additional erosion that takes place beyond the natural
one caused by the presence of a structure. Natural sandy
beaches between rocky headlands or man-made structures
are exposed to a predominant direction of wave attack and
take the characteristic seaward-concave plan shape, result-
ing from erosion caused by refraction, diffraction and
reflection of waves into the shadow zone behind the head-
land/structure. The main aspect of such erosion is the
resulting distinctive crescent or log spiral form. This shape
has been explored by some researchers and is frequently
associated with the development of headland bay (Hsu
et al., 1996, 2010; Hsu and Evans, 1989). Figure 1 shows
Ramakrishnan et al. 155
the typical seawall with the length of Ls
facing a wave
attack at the angle of  causing an erosion on the down-
drift side of the wall with cross-shore length of r and along
shore length of S (McDougal et al., 1987; Tait and Griggs,
1991).
It is evident that hard structures can result in severe
consequences, thus, it becomes essential to understand the
impact of hard stabilization methods, particularly seawalls
on beaches, which forms the main objective of this article.
In this research, a combination of numerical modelling
(Manek and Balaji, 2014) and analytical modelling is used
to predict the end-wall effect which is validated with in-
situ measurements. Furthermore, the total longshore
sediment transport rate per year along the selected coast is
also estimated, based on an established theoretical model.
Independently, high-resolution satellite datasets are used
to study the shoreline changes that have taken place after
the seawall was constructed along the coastal region of
Fansa, Gujarat, India.
Study area
The study region (Figure 2) is located along the coastal
village of Fansa (72° 47 39.39E, 20° 21 06.35N), in the
district of Valsad, Gujarat, which adjoins the Arabian Sea.
A rubble-mound seawall with a total length of 900m was
constructed along this coastline in the year 2011 to protect
the shoreline against wave attack and subsequent erosion.
Data and methodology
Data collection
The flanking effect of seawall, along the coast of Fansa, is
measured by tracing the high tide line (HTL) and low tide
line (LTL) using a handheld global positioning system
GPS (Trimble GeoXT). Figure 3 represents the typical
view of the strategy followed to carry out beach profile in-
situ measurements in front of the seawall and also at the

behind the wall.

end of the wall along the coastline for August 2012. As can
be seen in Figure 4, the seawall along the Fansa coast is a
rubble-mound seawall which has resulted in the flanking
of the shoreline (Figure 5).
RS datasets. Temporal CARTOSAT 1 PAN data of compa-
rable season and tidal elevation are selected to estimate the
shoreline changes along this region. Data of spatial resolu-
tion of 2.5
m for 13 January 2011, 15 January 2012 and 7
December 2014 with Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM)
zone 43 north projection systems are used for this analysis.
Methodology
Numerical model ­ wave transformation study.Generally,
near-shore wave propagation is influenced by complex
bathymetry, currents, water-level variation and coastal
structures. The wave transformation study (Manek and
Balaji, 2014) is conducted using STWAVE (Anderson and
Smith, 2014; Massey et al., 2011), developed by the US
Army Corps of Engineers. STWAVE is a steady-state
finite difference model based on the wave action balance
equation that calculates wave spectra on a rectangular grid.
This wave transformation study helps to estimate the wave
parameters between offshore and near-shore of the selected
coast, and the results obtained from this are further used in
the analytical model.
Analytical model ­ Parabolic shape model.Headland bay
beaches of varying sizes and shapes exist at the down-
drift side of protruding natural or man-made (seawall,
jetty, etc.) headlands. Since 1940, scientists are trying to
establish an empirical expression to fit part or whole of
the bay periphery. Parabolic shape model (Hsu and Evans,
1989) is one such empirical model which represents the
shape of the equilibrium very well on the down-drift side.
This model relates the shoreline changes to the tip of an
up-drift headland or wave diffraction point, by virtue of
which it is possible to assess the relocation of the up-drift
control by man-made structures (i.e. seawall and detached
breakwaters).
This parabolic relationship is used to check the stability
of the crenulated-shaped bays, as this model performs
fairly well in representing the static equilibrium plan form
of the fully developed crenulated-shaped beaches. The
advantage of using parabolic model is that it is applicable
in tidal seas and can represent the high- and low-tide coast-
lines. However, the model is not capable of predicting the
equilibrium plan form in the coastlines, which are close to
the tidal inlets due to the dynamical characteristics of sedi-
ment transport. In addition, this model cannot predict the
effect of obstacles, such as islands, on the beach forma-
tions that are located slightly away from the coastline.

Parameters used.Assessment of beach shape at the end
of seawall at Fansa requires near-shore wave, sediment and
beach characteristics as priori. The results of an earlier wave
transformation study (Manek and Balaji, 2014) were used to
arrive at the near-shore wave characteristics, such as breaker
angle (b

=
3.5°) and breaking wave height (Hb
=1.5m).
Based on the in-situ measurements, the beach slope along
the Fansa coast is in the order of 1:800 to 1:900 (flat beach),
which gives the breaker index value,  as 0.78. Based on
the constructed seawall, beach berm height above still water
level (SWL; db

=
4
m) and depth of appreciable sand trans-
port from SWL (dc
=4m) are measured. From a simple sedi-
ment sample analysis, the porosity is estimated (n=0.4).
Beach-shape assessment at end of seawall.The control
points are selected as (1) the seawall edge and (2) a point
along the coastline without any erosion protection struc-
ture along it. The shape of the beach now depends on the
angle of the wave crest and the line joining the control
points. For this, the shoreline orientation is defined and
the predominant wave direction, as well as the wave char-
acteristics, is obtained from the transformation studies, as
explained earlier. Using these data, the possible coastline
recession due to the constructed seawall is estimated.
The estimation is, then, cross verified with another ana-
lytical shoreline changes model (Larson et al., 1987, 1997)
proposed for end effects of coastal structures. The position

satellite datasets are used to estimate the variations in
shorelines of different years. Vectorization technique is
applied to get the shoreline features of the years 2011,
2012 and 2014 in the ArcGIS 10 environment. This is fur-
ther used as an input to the DSAS tool to estimate the rate
of shoreline changes, which is calculated based on meas-
ured differences between shoreline positions through time.
The DSAS tool basically estimates the net shoreline move-
ment (NSM) and end point rate (EPR) which are used to
derive the output maps of this study. The NSM calculates
the distance between the oldest and the youngest shoreline
for each transect, and the EPR is obtained by dividing the
NSM, by the number of years elapsed between the two
shoreline positions. The linear extents with negative NSM
or EPR values indicate erosion, whereas those with posi-
tive values indicate accretion.
Results and discussion
Analytical modelling­based analysis
A maximum landward erosion of 20
m and alongshore
influence of the erosion of 200
m (Figure 7) is estimated
from the parabolic model, on the northern end of seawall,
for the first 1
year after completion of the construction.
This landward erosion may further extend up to another
20
m by 2014 and may then eventually stabilize. A com-
parison of the estimated landward erosion with the in-situ
measurements conducted during the site visit is found to
Figure 6. Definition sketch of variables employed in parabolic
solution of bays (Hsu and Evans, 1989).
158 The International Journal of Ocean and Climate Systems 8(3)
be in agreement with each other. Parabolic shape model
estimation is cross verified with the beach-shape assess-
ment method using equations (2) and (3). From this beach-
shape assessment method, change in adjacent shoreline at
the end of seawall is predicted to be around 23m which is
comparable with the parabolic shape model results.
It is understood from the earlier studies that the South
Gujarat coast experiences a high sediment transport of the
order of 1.5­2
Mm3 (Nayak and Chandramohan, 1992).
Specifically along the Valsad coast, the estimated south-
erly and northerly sediment transports are 0.594 and
0.98Mm3, respectively. It is clear from the numerical
model estimates that the northerly sediment drift is more,
and hence, the annual net sediment transport along the
Valsad coast is expected to be towards the north direction.
It is also reported that large monthly sediment transport is
generally observed to be during southwest monsoon,
which is about 2.3
×106m3 (Nayak and Chandramohan,
1992). In this study, using CERC (US Army Corps of
Engineers, 2002) equation, the estimated longshore sedi-
ment transport rate is of the order of 1.9×106m3 per year
along Fansa coast providing evidence of end-wall effect on
the northern side.
RS & GIS based analysis
The RS analysis is carried out independently to understand
the shoreline change dynamics of this region. In the satel-
lite dataset of 2011, only an incomplete seawall is seen,
which is observed to be completed in the satellite imagery
of 2012. Based on the visual analysis, it can be seen in
Figure 8 that approximately 250­300
m of the shoreline,
north of the seawall, for the year 2014, has completely
eroded due to the construction of the hard structure.
Moreover, it is interesting to observe that from 2011 to
2014, the landward erosion in the immediate vicinity of
the down-drift direction of the seawall is approximately
40m, which is also predicted by the analytical model.
Furthermore, a shoreline erosion analysis (Figure 9) is
carried out for the coastline along the northern side
approximately 250m away from the end of the seawall to
qualitatively and quantitatively understand the effects of
the installation. It is estimated that the average EPR is
approximately about 0.417m/year and the average NSM
is 1.63m.
An important advantage of RS especially in this study
is that it provides a snapshot of the temporal, as well as
spatial, changes that take place over a period of time.
Hence, using CARTOSAT 1 imagery, it has been possible
to understand the effect of the seawall in the adjoining
region post construction. Another important observation
that is witnessed in the satellite datasets (Figure 10) is that
the high sediment deposition in this region has caused a
decrease in the size of the river mouth in the 2014 image,
resulting in the narrowing of the channel (encircled in red)
that allows the water to flow inland. As discussed in the
previous section, the longshore sediment transport in this
region is reportedly northward, and hence, the change in
the sediment transport dynamics due to the seawall con-
struction can be hypothesized to have some impact on the
adjoining river mouth as can be seen clearly in the images.
In order to verify this observation, it is imperative to con-
duct a thorough investigation with the help of numerical
modelling; however, this can be considered as a reasonable

shape view of end-wall effect.

inference as no changes are seen in the year 2011 and
2012, but only in 2014.
Finally, it can be suggested that sediment mobilization,
wave reflection causing sediment transport, refraction and
diffraction are some of the commonly cited processes
involved in the seawall­beach interaction (Tait and Griggs,
1991). Much of the end scour observed here is triggered
due to alongshore sediment transport caused by reflecting
waves in an alongshore direction, as well as refraction and
diffraction. In this study, the effects of seawall are seen in
the form of scouring, change in sediment dynamics and
shoreline changes in the adjoining regions.
Conclusion
In the present times, there has been considerable change in
the approach to coastal management by virtue of the
improvement in the understanding and knowledge of
coastal dynamics and shoreline erosion. Very often, the
detrimental effects of seawall construction are overlooked
in order to preserve the beach and to control the irrespon-
sible shoreline development that takes place along it.
In this study, an effort has been made to understand the
effects of seawall construction using a combination of
numerical and analytical modelling and geo-informatics. It
is evident that the construction of seawall along the coast
of Fansa has resulted in a landward erosion of about 20m
in the down-drift direction of the seawall, within a year of
construction. Based on a theoretical model, the beach is
further predicted to erode by another 20m before attaining
the state of equilibrium by the year 2014. This estimation
is successfully validated through an RS-based analysis, the
results of which confirm that the landward erosion from
2011 to 2014 is approximately 40m in the northern side of
the sea wall.
Although the beach along the coast of Fansa is pre-
dicted to have already stabilized, the construction of sea-
wall has evidently caused some changes in the shoreline
morphology. It is important to understand that although the
construction of hard structures allows for the protection of
the property by controlling the beach and bluff erosion,
this kind of fortification reduces the natural delivery of
sand leading to detrimental effects in the down-drift coast
beaches. This study highlights the need to examine the
seawall­beach interaction on a case-by-case basis, so that
a more informed decision can be made while installing a
hard structure to control shoreline erosion.
