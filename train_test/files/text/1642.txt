Objective: To determine the prevalence and adequacy
ofdepressioncareamongdifferentethnicandracialgroups
in the United States.
Design: Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Sur-
veys (CPES) data were analyzed to calculate nationally
representative estimates of depression care.
Setting: The 48 coterminous United States.
Participants: Household residents 18 years and older
(N=15 762) participated in the study.
Main Outcome Measures: Past-year depression phar-
macotherapy and psychotherapy using American Psy-
chiatric Association guideline-concordant therapies. De-
pression severity was assessed with the Quick Inventory
of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report. Primary pre-
dictors were major ethnic/racial groups (Mexican Ameri-
can, Puerto Rican, Caribbean black, African American,
and non-Latino white) and World Mental Health Com-
posite International Diagnostic Interview criteria for 12-
month major depressive episode.
Results: Mexican American and African American in-
dividualsmeeting12-monthmajordepressioncriteriacon-
sistently and significantly had lower odds for any de-
pression therapy and guideline-concordant therapies
despite depression severity ratings not significantly dif-
fering between ethnic/racial groups. All groups re-
ported higher use of any past-year psychotherapy and
guideline-concordant psychotherapy compared with phar-
macotherapy; however, Caribbean black and African
American individuals reported the highest proportions
of this use.
Conclusions: Few Americans with recent major depres-
sion have used depression therapies and guideline-
concordant therapies; however, the lowest rates of use
were found among Mexican American and African Ameri-
can individuals. Ethnic/racial differences were found de-
spite comparable depression care need. More Ameri-
cans with recent major depression used psychotherapy
over pharmacotherapy, and these differences were most
pronounced among Mexican American and African
American individuals. This report underscores the im-
portance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups and de-
pression therapies in understanding and directing ef-
forts to improve depression care in the United States.

OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS,
unipolar depression is
projected to be the sec-
ond leading cause of dis-
ability worldwide and the
leading cause of disability in high-
income nations, including the United
States.1 Within the United States, depres-
sion is a leading cause of disability among
major ethnic and racial groups.2 There are
2 main modalities of depression care that
are efficacious and well tolerated, pro-
vided that they are concordant with ex-
tant treatment guidelines: pharmaco-
therapy and psychotherapy.3 Nevertheless,
most Americans who meet diagnostic cri-
teria for major depression are untreated or
undertreated.4,5 Except for clinical samples,
depression treatments are commonly ag-
gregated (ie, pharmacotherapy and psy-
chotherapy) in national studies and it is
unclear which treatments are used.6 Fur-
thermore, because major ethnic/racial
groups are aggregated (ie, all Latino indi-
viduals as opposed to specific sub-
groups) in national studies, a practice dis-
couraged by the Surgeon General and the
National Institutes of Health, it is un-
clear if important ethnic/racial group dif-
ferences are missed.7
TheInstituteofMedicineUnequalTreat-
ment committee defined a disparity as
racial or ethnic differences in the quality of
health care that are not due to access-related
factors or clinical needs, preferences, and ap-
propriateness of intervention.8(p32)
The purpose of this study was to use this
Institute of Medicine definition of dispar-
ity in an examination of depression care

torswereexaminedthatpurportedlyenableaccesstohealth
care. For clinical needs, depression severity was com-
pared between ethnic/racial groups. Patterns of depres-
sion treatment use by ethnic/racial groups meeting major
depression criteria were used as a proxy for preferences.
Toevaluatetheappropriatenessofinterventions,onlyadults
who met diagnostic criteria for 12-month major depres-
sion were examined. To achieve these objectives, data dis-
aggregated by ethnic/racial groups were used that in-
cluded depression treatment modalities and adequacy of
treatment among nationally representative samples of US
adults who met criteria for 12-month major depression.
To better understand patterns of depression care among
diverse ethnic/racial groups and formally evaluate Insti-
tute of Medicine­based disparity criteria, we applied a
modification of the Andersen behavioral model of health
services use to analyses of nationally representative popu-
lation survey data.9 The behavioral model posits 3 ma-
jor factors (ie, predisposing, health need, and enabling)
related to accessing health services. We predicted that
predisposing factors, particularly ethnic/racial, would be
associated with access to depression care. Second, we ex-
pected that health needs would not differ between ethnic/
racial groups. Next, we anticipated that access-related fac-
tors would be associated with care but not appreciably
affect ethnic/racial differences in depression care.
METHODS
DATA COLLECTION
The National Institute of Mental Health Collaborative Psychi-
atric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES) initiative combines 3 na-
tionally representative studies: the National Survey of Ameri-
can Life, the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, and the
National Latino and Asian American Study. The CPES data were
collected between February 2001 and November 2003. Sam-
pling weights accounting for unequal probability of selection
into the CPES samples and nonresponse rates were created by
CPES staff to enable nationally representative analyses of pairs
of studies within the CPES. These weights were incorporated
in all analyses presented in this study, allowing for the genera-
tion of population estimates by analyzing data specific to popu-
lations of interest.10 The CPES data collection used complex
multistage area probability sampling methods using sampling
frames and sample selection procedures developed as a part of
the University of Michigan Survey Research Center National
Sample Design.11 The method used to integrate the individual
CPES studies was based on a multiple-frame approach adapted
from Hartley12,13 and described in Heeringa et al.11
The CPES interviewers used face-to-face computer-
assisted interview technology to collect data from integrated
national household probability samples of noninstitutional-
ized adults. Specially trained nonclinician interviewers admin-
istered to respondents the World Mental Health (WMH) Com-
posite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI), which can be
used to compute indicators of past-year DSM-IV diagnoses of
a major depressive episode.14 Fair to good concordance values
have been reported between nonclinician-administered WMH-
CIDIs and clinician-administered Structured Clinical Inter-
view for DSM-IV reappraisals.15,16 The overall CPES response
rate was 72.3%. Final response rates for the CPES sample de-
sign were computed following the best-practice guidelines of
the American Association for Public Opinion Research, incor-
porating disproportionate sampling, household screening, and
2-phase sampling for nonresponse follow-up.11
ANALYSIS OF SUBPOPULATIONS
We examined depression care among 5 major ethnic/racial
groups who self-identified as Mexican, Puerto Rican, Carib-
bean black, African American, and non-Latino white. Our pri-
mary interest was in depression care among the subpopula-
tion who met DSM-IV criteria for 12-month major depression
derived from the WMH-CIDI. Ethnicity/race was the primary
predictor of the main depression care outcome measures (see
later). Appropriate methods for subpopulation analyses of com-
plex sample survey data were used for estimation of descrip-
tive parameters and estimation of analytic models.17,18
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Two groups of depression care outcomes were examined: phar-
macotherapy and psychotherapy. With pharmacotherapy, anti-
depressant agent use was determined by self-report and pill bottle
inventories. Trained interviewers recorded prescription antide-
pressant generic and trade names from pill bottles during inter-
views. Generic and trade names were reviewed by 2 board-
certified psychiatrists and a psychiatric nurse specialist to verify
that the drugs were antidepressants prior to drug coding for the
analyses.Forpsychotherapy,respondentswereasked"Howmany
visits" were made to a mental health professional (ie, psychia-
trist,psychologist,counselor,socialworker,andotherhealthpro-
fessionals)"inthepast12months?"and"Howmanyminutesthese
visits lasted on average?" Lay counselors (eg, pastors) were ex-
cluded. The following indicators of past 12-month use of depres-
sion care were computed for analysis purposes: (1) any pharma-
cotherapy;(2)anypsychotherapy;(3)eitheroftheaforementioned
types of therapy; and (4) combined therapies.

or other prescribing clinician, for at least 4 visits in the past year.
Forpsychotherapy,guidelineconcordancewasoperationalizedas
having at least 4 visits to a mental health professional in the past
year lasting on average for at least 30 minutes each.
PRIMARY PREDICTOR MEASURES
Ethnicity/race was the primary Andersen model predisposing
factor predictor used among the subpopulation who met 12-
month major depression criteria. The 5 major ethnic/racial
groups examined were Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Ca-
ribbean black, African American, and non-Latino white (ref-
erence group).
DEPRESSION CARE NEED MEASURE
To determine if the need for depression care differed between
ethnic/racial groups, we compared symptom severity ratings
between groups. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology Self-Report was used to measure symptom sever-
ity during the worst 2-week period of the past year.19 The Quick
Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report is a brief
and reliable test that has been validated using other estab-
lished measures of depression severity (eg, 24-item Hamilton
Depression Rating Scale). We opted to compare depression se-
verity ratings (as opposed to symptom counts) since they are a
commonly used indicator of need for treatment in clinical trials.

COVARIATES
The base multivariate models included the additional predis-
posing factors of age and sex. Ages were grouped into 3 cat-
egories (18-34 years, 35-64 years, and 64 years). Additional
covariates represented Andersen model enabling factors and in-
cluded categorical measures of family income ($18 000;
$18 000-$31 999; $32 000-$54 999; and $55 000), educa-
tion (12 years; 12 years; 13-15 years; and 16 years), health
insurance, and household income. Health insurance coverage
included Medicare, Medicaid, or TRICARE/CHAMPUS; cur-
rent or former employee-based coverage; and coverage pur-
chased directly from an insurance company (including group
purchasing, eg, AARP [formerly known as the American As-
sociation of Retired Persons]).
ANALYTIC APPROACH
Procedures designed for the analysis of complex sample sur-
vey data in the Stata software package were used for analyses
on all subpopulations.20 All statistical estimates were weighted,
using the CPES sampling weights to account for individual-
level unequal probabilities of selection into the samples, indi-
vidual nonresponse, and additional poststratification to en-
sure representation of the US population.11 Design-based
analyses, specifically a Taylor series linearization approach to
variance estimation, were used to account for the complex mul-
tistage clustered design of the CPES samples when computing
estimated standard errors.21
First, sample estimates describing demographic character-
istics were calculated. Next, ordinary least squares regression
models were used to compare the depression severity between
the 5 ethnic/racial groups. The following analyses were exclu-
sively focused on the subpopulation of respondents who met
WMH-CIDI 12-month major depression criteria. Then, the
prevalence of any past-year depression pharmacotherapy and
psychotherapy and guideline-concordant therapies use was cal-
culated. Finally, 6 multivariate logistic regression models were
fitted. The first set of 3 models was used to predict the prob-
ability of pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy use by the 5
groups of interest. The second set of models was used to pre-
dict the probability of receiving guideline-concordant, mini-
mally adequate pharmacotherapy and/or psychotherapy.
RESULTS
The CPES sample characteristics and prevalence esti-
mates of 12-month major depression for the 5 ethnic/
racial groups are provided in Table 1.
DEPRESSION CARE NEED
The mean values for Quick Inventory of Depressive Symp-
tomatology Self-Report scores between ethnic/racial
groups were similar (Table 1). Among respondents meet-
ing 12-month major depression criteria, Mexican Ameri-
can, African American, and non-Latino white individu-
als had similar depression severity rating scores, which
were slightly higher than those of Puerto Rican and Ca-
ribbean black individuals. The estimates of the multi-
variate regression model for our severity outcome, con-
trolling for age and sex, show that ethnic/racial groups
did not differ in their mean level of severity relative to

the non-Latino white referent group. Further, a Wald test
(F4,138
=0.66) showed that the coefficients for the ethnic/
racial dummy variables were not jointly different than
zero (probabilityF=0.62). These findings indicated that
depression treatment need was not significantly differ-
ent and therefore was not included in subsequent statis-
tical models.

AND GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT USE
AMONG RESPONDENTS MEETING 12-MONTH
MAJOR DEPRESSION CRITERIA
Overall, about 1 in 3 respondents who met WMH-CIDI
criteria for 12-month major depression reported having
used an antidepressant agent in the past year (Table 2).
Puerto Rican and non-Latino white individuals re-
ported the highest use, whereas Mexican American, Ca-
ribbean black, and African American individuals re-
ported the lowest use of pharmacotherapy.
Among pharmacotherapy users, about one-third had
used antidepressant agents according to the study crite-
ria. The guideline-concordant use was highest among
Puerto Rican and non-Latino white individuals and low-
est among Mexican American, Caribbean black, and Afri-
can American individuals.
PREVALENCE ESTIMATES OF PAST-YEAR
DEPRESSION PSYCHOTHERAPY USE
AND GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT USE
AMONG RESPONDENTS MEETING 12-MONTH
MAJOR DEPRESSION CRITERIA
Psychotherapy use was higher than pharmacotherapy
use overall. A similar pattern emerged, with Puerto
Rican and non-Latino white individuals reporting the
highest use of psychotherapy, and Mexican American,
Caribbean black, and African American individuals
reporting the lowest use.
The proportions of psychotherapy use that were guide-
line concordant were higher than for depression phar-
macotherapy use. Notably, those proportions were es-
pecially higher among Mexican American, Caribbean
black, and African American individuals. In a separate
logistic regression analysis (not shown), African Ameri-
can individuals (odds ratio [OR], 2.65; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.47-4.77) reported significantly higher odds
of psychotherapy use compared with pharmacotherapy
use relative to non-Latino white individuals; however,
for Mexican American individuals (OR, 1.58; 95% CI,
0.78-3.20), the association was not significantly differ-
ent. The proportions of concordant psychotherapy were
higher for each ethnic/racial group examined compared
with pharmacotherapy. This suggests that in terms of de-
pression care, although still too low, the adherence rate
for psychotherapy was higher than for pharmaco-
therapy.
PREVALENCE ESTIMATES OF PAST-YEAR
DEPRESSION THERAPY USE
AND GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT USE
AMONG RESPONDENTS MEETING 12-MONTH
MAJOR DEPRESSION CRITERIA
More than half of the respondents who met study crite-
ria for 12-month major depression received at least 1 form
of depression care. As before, Mexican American, Carib-
bean black, and African American individuals were the
least likely to have used either pharmacotherapy or psy-
chotherapy in the past year. About 1 in 5 respondents
(21.3%) with 12-month major depression had at least 1
form of guideline-concordant therapy in the past year.
The proportions of Puerto Rican and non-Latino white
individuals who used concordant therapies in the past
year were nearly twice those of Mexican American, Ca-
ribbean black, and African American individuals.
The overall rate of past-year combined pharmaco-
therapy and psychotherapy was lower than each inde-
pendent therapy (eg, psychotherapy alone) and consis-
tently lower in each of the ethnic/racial groups examined.
Consistent with the findings shown in Table 2, non-
Latino white and Puerto Rican individuals had the high-
est rates of combined depression therapies compared with
African American, Caribbean black, and Mexican Ameri-
can individuals.

Also consistent with our findings in Table 2, non-
Latino white and Puerto Rican individuals had the high-
est guideline-concordance rates for both forms of de-
pression treatment. We examined the proportions of
concordantdepressiontherapiesamongrespondentsusing
both therapies (not shown). Most combined therapies use
(39.7%) did not meet guideline criteria for either treat-
ment type. About one-third (32.1%) used both thera-
pies according to guidelines, followed by psycho-
therapy alone (20.5%) and pharmacotherapy only (7.8%).
These proportions did not vary significantly between eth-
nic/racial groups.
PREDICTORS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY USE
AND GUIDELINE-CONCORDANT USE
AMONG RESPONDENTS MEETING 12-MONTH
MAJOR DEPRESSION CRITERIA
The predisposing factors predicting past-year depression
pharmacotherapy are shown in the first model of Table 3.
Compared with non-Latino white individuals, Mexican
American and African American individuals had signifi-
cantly lower odds of past-year depression pharmaco-
therapy. With enabling factors added to the model, Afri-
can American individuals had significantly lower odds of
pharmacotherapy use compared with non-Latino white in-
dividuals and the lower odds of use by Mexican American
individuals was marginally significant. Of the enabling fac-
tors, health insurance coverage was significantly associ-
ated with higher odds of pharmacotherapy use.
For guideline-concordant past-year depression phar-
macotherapy, Caribbean black and African American in-
dividuals had significantly lower odds compared with non-
Latino white individuals. Adding enabling factors to the
previous model had little effect on the low odds of de-
pression pharmacotherapy for the 2 black groups stud-
ied. None of the enabling factors were significantly as-
sociated with the odds of concordant pharmacotherapy.

pared with non-Latino white individuals (Table 4). The
lower odds of psychotherapy use by Mexican American
individuals was reduced to marginal significance by in-
clusion of enabling factors in the previous model, but the
significantly low odds of psychotherapy use by African
American individuals was largely unaffected. Health in-
surance coverage was associated with significantly in-
creased odds of psychotherapy use.
For guideline-concordant psychotherapy use, Afri-
can American individuals had significantly lower odds
compared with non-Latino white individuals, and there
was a trend for lower concordant use by Mexican Ameri-
can individuals. When enabling factors were intro-
duced into the model, the statistically significant or nearly
significant associations for African American and Mexi-
can American individuals were markedly reduced. Of the
enabling factors, education beyond high school level was
associated with significantly increased odds of concor-
dant psychotherapy use.

AMONG RESPONDENTS MEETING 12-MONTH
MAJOR DEPRESSION CRITERIA
Mexican American and African American individuals had
significantly lower odds of any depression therapy use
(ie, psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy) than non-
Latino white individuals (Table 5). When enabling fac-
tors were added to the model, the difference in odds of
depression therapy use for Mexican American individu-
als was reduced and rendered only marginally signifi-
cantly lower compared with non-Latino white individu-
als. Health insurance coverage doubled the odds of any
past-year depression therapy use, whereas other en-
abling factors were not significant.
For any guideline-concordant past-year depression
therapy among respondents meeting 12-month major de-
pression criteria, Mexican American and African Ameri-
can individuals had significantly lower odds. With the
inclusion of enabling factors, African American individu-
als had significantly lower odds of any concordant de-
pression therapy compared with non-Latino white indi-
viduals, and the odds for Mexican American individuals
were no longer significant. Of the enabling factors ex-
amined, higher education was associated with in-
creased odds of having past-year guideline-concordant
depression therapy.

African American (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.53) and

viduals reported significantly lower odds of past-year com-
bineddepressiontherapycomparedwithnon-Latinowhite
individuals (data not shown). Following aforemen-
tioned results patterns, the inclusion of enabling factors
had little effect on the odds for African American indi-
viduals, but the odds for Mexican American individuals
were only marginally significant. Health insurance cov-
erage (OR, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.21-4.66) was associated with
significantly increased odds of combined depression
therapy use.
For past-year combined guideline-concordant thera-
pies, Caribbean black individuals (OR, 0.02; 95% CI, 0.00-
0.18) and African American individuals (OR, 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.25-0.79) had significantly lower odds compared with
non-Latino white individuals. Adding enabling factors to
the previous model had little effect on the significantly
low odds for Caribbean black and African American in-
dividuals for combined depression therapy.
COMMENT
Although depression is a leading cause of disability in
the United States, few Americans with recent major de-
pression receive any form of standard care and even fewer
receive care that is concordant with the American Psy-
chiatric Association guideline.3 Ethnicity and race were
found to be important determinants of receiving phar-
macotherapy, psychotherapy, or any form of treatment
and care that meets the current guideline for depression
care. By disaggregating ethnic/racial groups, we were able
to specify which subgroups, namely African American
and Mexican American, were the least likely to receive
depression care, especially guideline-concordant care.3
The ethnic/racial treatment differences found herein were
in the context of indistinguishable depression need or se-
verity between groups. Our findings underscore the im-
portance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups to un-
derstand which ones are using what types of depression
treatment to unravel disparities in care. By disaggregat-
ing depression treatment types, we provided detailed pat-
terns of major depression care use and guideline-
concordant use among major ethnic/racial groups in the
United States that have been overlooked.22,23 Ulti-
mately, this greater specificity may provide useful in-
sights for better targeting mental health care to minor-
ity populations and improving depression care for all
Americans.
In this national study of depression care, psycho-
therapy was used at higher rates than pharmacotherapy.
The differences in therapy modality were most promi-
nent among African American and Mexican American in-
dividuals, the 2 groups who reported the lowest rates of
any depression treatment use. More importantly per-
haps was our finding that psychotherapy users were more
likely to receive guideline-concordant therapy com-
pared with depression pharmacotherapy. The differ-
ences between guideline-concordant psychotherapy and
pharmacotherapy use were highest among Caribbean
black, African American, and Mexican American indi-
viduals, respectively. One possible explanation for the
higher use and guideline-concordant use of psycho-
therapy than pharmacotherapy found in this study is that
psychotherapy may have a comparably higher specific-
ity of use for major depression. Although our findings
and hypothesis will require further inquiry for support,
the findings herein demonstrate the value of disaggre-
gating treatment types to better characterize mental health

care use and means for improving care delivery. In ad-
dition, although we did not directly assess treatment pref-
erences, our findings regarding higher psychotherapy use
are consistent with previous studies reporting higher ac-
ceptability for psychotherapy over pharmacotherapy, es-
pecially among ethnic/racial minorities facing dispari-
ties in depression care.24-26
Overall, Puerto Rican individuals had the highest preva-
lence of 12-month major depression compared with the
other ethnic/racial groups examined in this study, a find-
ing consistent with the higher overall rates of psychiatric
disordersanddualdiagnoses.27,28 Paradoxically,PuertoRican
individuals, along with Caribbean black individuals, had
the lowest depression severity ratings of the ethnic/racial
groups. Puerto Rican individuals had rates of depression
treatment use and concordant use that were similar to, and
in some instances higher than, those of non-Latino white
individuals. The reasons for the relatively "good" depres-
sion care among Puerto Rican individuals are encourag-
ing and perhaps attributable to their nonimmigrant status
and greater English-language dominance in this popula-
tion. However, the differences in access and quality of care
are not always detectable because of the convention of
"lumping" rather than "sorting" Latino subgroups in US
health databases. Lumping makes it nearly impossible to
identify determinants of health care quality for ethnic/
racial subgroups. What is clear from our study is that dis-
parities in depression care among Latino individuals are
predominantly found among Mexican American individu-
als. The public mental health significance of our finding is
that Mexican American individuals represent more than
two-thirds of Latino individuals in the United States.29 Our
findings indicate that efforts to reduce disparities in care
among Latino individuals should especially focus on Mexi-
can American individuals. Furthermore, our findings show
that disparities in depression care for Mexican American
individuals were attenuated by factors that enable access
to health care and may guide efforts for reducing dispari-
ties in health care.
Health insurance coverage was associated with higher
depression care but not guideline-concordant use among
respondents who met 12-month major depression cri-
teria. This suggests that while health insurance cover-
age may enable better access to depression care it does
not ensure "better" care. More education was associated
with higher guideline-concordant psychotherapy use but

not use in general, which is consistent with previous work
on mental health treatment adherence.30 The precise rea-
sons for this incongruity between use and guideline-
concordant use are not entirely clear from this study; how-
ever, this may reflect interactions between patient
nonadherence and inadequacies in patient monitoring by
prescribing clinicians. For Caribbean black and African
American individuals, however, neither health insur-
ance coverage nor any other factor examined in this study
explained their lower pharmacotherapy use, which is con-
sistent with previous work.31,32 African American indi-
viduals may find antidepressant agents less acceptable than
other groups33,34; however, alternative explanations re-
quire further exploration. One alternative health care de-
livery-side explanation is that the large differences in de-
pression care use by ethnic/racial groups in the United
States suggest unmet need that may stem from "separate
and unequal" sources of health care.35,36
Recent research indicates that perceived discrimina-
tion in general and perceptions of bias within the health
care context can shape health care seeking and adher-
ence behaviors. For example, perceived discrimination has
been associated with delays or failure to seek treatment
forAfricanAmericanandLatinoindividuals.37-39 Otherstud-
ies have also related perceived discrimination by African
American and Latino individuals with the use of alterna-
tive care instead of conventional care and with lower lev-
els of satisfaction with care.40,41 These studies have not fo-
cused on depression care, but this research suggests that
future research should explore the extent to which pa-
tients' subjective experiences of racial bias may affect their
access and use of mental health care.
To our knowledge, this is the first national study to
examine specific depression therapy types by disaggre-
gated major ethnic/racial subgroups who met diagnos-
tic criteria for major depression. By doing so, we re-
vealed important patterns of therapy use by specific ethnic/
racial groups that were masked in previous research.23,42
Specifically, we demonstrated that Latino disparities in
depression care occurred among Mexican American in-
dividuals. Additionally, the level of depression care for
Puerto Rican individuals is generally similar to non-
Latino white individuals and in some instances is supe-
rior. This study used sophisticated sampling proce-
dures that make it among the largest and most inclusive
studies of depression care use among Americans, regard-

less of health care insurance coverage. Such inclusive-
ness, we believe, avoids potential sampling biases in ad-
ministrative medical record studies where only patients
with access to health care are examined. Avoiding this
sampling bias is essential to evaluating ethnic/racial dis-
parities in health care since national estimates of health
insurance coverage among ethnic/racial minorities are
lower than among non-Latino white individuals.29
Although our results are most likely the best estimates
to date, our study should be interpreted in the context of
several limitations. The CPES excluded homeless or in-
stitutionalizedpersons,whichcouldunderestimatetheun-
met need for treatment of depressive disorders, particu-
larly among ethnic/racial minorities who are incarcerated
at a higher rate than non-Latino white individuals nation-
ally.43 Second, as a diagnostic instrument, the WMH-
CIDI has a modest sensitivity and high specificity for de-
tecting "true" psychiatric disorders (eg, major depression)
among CPES respondents.4,32 Thus, it is likely that some
cases with "true" psychiatric disorders were missed, which
couldartificiallyinflatetheproportionofrespondentswith-
outmentaldisordersusingdepressioncare.Third,ourdefi-
nition of guideline concordance may have influenced our
estimates. Although we examined only mental health pro-
fessionals providing psychotherapy, we were unable to de-
termineifthespecifictypesofpsychotherapy(eg,cognitive-
behavioral) reported were "evidence based" as prescribed
in the American Psychiatric Association guideline.3 Ad-
ditionally, our use of the American Psychiatric Associa-
tion guideline did not consider brief and chronic depres-
sive conditions, which may be missed by our definition
of concordant use. Fourth, concerted efforts to "harmo-
nize" the CPESs for use among the various ethnic/racial
groupsmayhaveintroducedunrecognizederrorsthatcould
have affected the results of this study. Given the magni-
tude of inequalities in depression care that we observed,
the main inferences of our work should be stable.
CONCLUSIONS
Most Americans with recent major depression go un-
treated or undertreated. Our findings underscore the im-
portance of disaggregating ethnic/racial groups. Failing
to do so obscures depression care research, especially for
the largest and fastest-growing segment of the US popu-
lation, Latino individuals, and especially Mexican Ameri-
can individuals.4,7 Consistent with previous studies that
have aggregated depression therapy, we found that ethnic/
racial group was an important predictor of depression care
in the United States.23,32 In contrast to previous work that
has aggregated Latino groups, we found striking ineq-
uities in depression care and guideline-concordant use
for Mexican American individuals.4,7 Nationally, psycho-
therapy was used by higher proportions of Americans with
recent depression. Interestingly, lack of health insur-
ance coverage partially explained disparities in depres-
sion care for Mexican American individuals, but not for
African American individuals, suggesting other factors
may be contributing to their differences.
With the recent passing of a US Mental Health Parity
Act, our findings should provide guidance to better-
enabled mental health to improve the depression care of
all Americans and for reducing disparities among ethnic/
racial minorities. Improving mental health care at com-
mon points of service delivery (eg, primary care) and im-
proving the availability of preferred depression therapies
may be needed. Collaborative care models that provide
depression therapy choices show promise for improv-
ing care, patient outcomes, and clinician satisfaction, while
containing costs.44,45 Finally, new independent research
may be needed to explore adherence, efficacy, and cost
efficacy of different depression therapies within and be-
tween ethnic/racial groups.
