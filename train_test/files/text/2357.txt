I Abstract I
The analysisof meconiumspecimensfor metabolites of substances
of abuse is a relativelyaccuratemethodfor the detectionof fetal
exposureto drugs.Most of the methodsreported in the literature
beforethe early 1990s reliedon radioimmunoassays.The purpose
of thisstudywasto developand validate methodsfor meconium
samplepreparationfor the screeningand gaschromatography-mass
spectrometry(GC-MS) confirmationof meconiumextractsfor
cannabinoids,cocaine,opiates,amphetamines,and phencyclidine.
EMITTM
and TDxTM
immunoassayswere evaluatedasscreening
methods. The sample preparation method developedfor screening
included extraction and purificationprior to analysis.Cutoff levels
were administratively set at 20 ng/g for 11-nor-Ag-THC-9-COOH
(THCCOOH) and phencyclidineand at 200 ng/g for
benzoylecgonine, morphine,and amphetamines,althoughlower
levels could be detected in meconium using the EMIT-ETS
TM
system.
Ninety-five meconium specimenswere subjected to the screening
procedure with GC-MS confirmation of presumptive positives. In
addition, 30 (40 for cocaine) meconium specimens were subjected
to GC-MS analysisfor all analytes regardlessof the screening results
to determine the false-negative rate, if any, of the immunoassay.
Althoughthere were no falsenegativesdetected,the GC-MS
confirmationrate for the immunoassay-positivespecimenswas
generally low, ranging from 0% for amphetaminesto 75% for
opiates. The lowest rate of confirmed positives wasfound with the
cannabinoids,suggestingthat tetrahydrocannabinol(THC)
metaboUtesother than free 11-nor-9-carboxy-Ag-THC may be major
contributorsto the immunoassay responsein meconium.
Introduction
Useand abuseofdrugs bypregnantwomen has stimulatedthe
developmentofproceduresto identifynewbornswho havebeen
exposedto drugs in utero.Althoughurine andbloodare the most
obviousspecimensto test, datacollectedon the analysisofurine,
blood,and meconium of infants born to drug-abusing mothers
showed higher positivity rates in meconium than in urine or
blood(1,2).
Meconiumwas,therefore,usedby many investigators(3-6) to
detect intrauterine exposureofnewbornsto drugs ofabuse,par-
ticularlycocaine,marijuana, andheroin. Mostinvestigatorswho
pioneered drug testing in meconium used radioimmunoassay
(RIA)as the initial screening method (1-5) with fewerapplica-
tions offluorescence-polarizationimmunoassay (FPIA)and gas
chromatography-massspectrometry (GC--MS)(6).
Determinationofprenatal exposuretodrugs through testingof
meconium is important becausepregnant women under-report
drug use (5).In a large-scale,prospective,epidemioiogicstudy,
Ostrea et al. (7) examined meconium specimens from infants
bornto3010mothers ina high-riskurbanpopulationforcocaine,
opiates,and marijuana.Forty-fourpercentofthe specimenswere
positivefor one or more of the three drugclasses.Ofthese, 31%
were positive for cocaine, 21% for morphine, and 12% for
cannabinoids. However,only 11% of the mothers admitted to
illicitdruguse.It mustbe emphasizedthatthis degreeofpositives
was basedon RIAscreening ofdiluted meconiumonly.It should
alsobe notedthat most ofthe workreportedin the earlier litera-
ture wasbasedon immunoassayanalysisand was not confirmed
byother methodssuch as GC-MS.
In 1992,the National Institute of ChildHealth and Human
Development(NICHD)and theNationalInstitute onDrugAbuse
(NIDA)issued a contract to developandvalidate screening and
GC-MSconfirmationmethods for the analysisofdrugs ofabuse
in meconium specimensat levelsfar belowthe commonlyused
cutofflevelsin the commercialurine drug-testingfield.Specific
analytes required for this studywere 11-nor-A9-THC-9-COOH
(THCCOOH)(forcannabinoids);benzoylecgonine,cocaine,and
cocaethylene (forcocaine); morphine, codeine, 6-monoacetyl-
morphine, hydrocodone, and hydromorphone (for opiates);
amphetamine and methamphetamine (foramphetamines); and
phencyclidine(PCP).The resultsof the developmentand valida-
tion studiesweresummarizedinJanuaryof1993ina report sub-
mitted to NICHD(8),and the methods were subsequentlyused
forthe analysisofmeconium specimenssubmittedbythe partic-
ipatingsitesofthe "MaternalLifestyleStudy", specifically,Brown
University, University of Miami, University of Tennessee at
Memphis,and WayneState University.This manuscript reports

considered in conjunctionwith the work reported here.
Materialsand Methods
Meconiumspecimens
Blankmeconium specimens were collected from unidentified
infantsborn in a local hospital. Other meconiumspecimens were
obtained, with the consent of the mothers, from the four sites
participating in the NICHD Maternal Lifestyle Study: Brown
University,Universityof Miami, Wayne State University,and the
UniversityofTennessee. Blank meconiumpoolswereanalyzed by
both screening and GC-MS procedures at limit of detection
(LOD)levelsprior to use.
Forbest results, a minimum of0.5 g meconiumwas neededto
screenforall fivedrug classesand I g to confirmfor eachpositive
by GC-MS.Smaller amounts could be used, but a dilution factor
that would lowerthe sensitivity ofthe assayswould be required.
Equipment
Screening equipment consisted of the EMIT-ETS analyzer
(SyvaCorp., now Dade-Behring, Palo Alto, CA) and the Abbott
TDxsystem (AbbottLaboratories, Chicago,IL).Asonic disrupter,
model TSD-600 with a 1/8-in. microtip and sound enclosure
(Tekmar-Dohrmann, Cincinnati, OH), was used for disrupting
meconium with extraction solvents. A centrifugal vacuum con-
centrator (model RC-10.10,system 3) equippedwith an ultra-low
temperature condenser (-105~ and a high-volume pump (190
L/rain) (Jouan, Inc.,Winchester, VA)wasused forthe evaporation
ofthe extraction solvents ofmeconium specimens.
GC-MS equipment consisted of a Hewlett-Packard 5890 GC
connected with a 5970B MS.
TheGC-MSwastuned daily,and the dwelltime used forall ions
monitored in the SIM mode was 50 ms. Capillarycolumns were
acquired from J&W Scientific (Folsom, CA).Identification and
analyticalconditions are described under the individual drugs.
Reagentsand chemicals
Allimmunoassay reagents and bufferswereprepared according
to the manufacturers'protocols. EMIT(d.a.u.)reagents wereused
in conjunction with the EMIT-ETSsystem. All organic solvents
and chemicals were analytical grade.
Drugstandardsand internalstandards
The THC metabolite, ll-nor-A9-THC-9-COOH (THCCOOH)
anditsinternal standard (11-nor-A9-THC-9-COOH-d6)wereprod-
ucts ofE1SohlyLaboratories, Inc. (Oxford,MS).Other standards
and internal standards were obtained from commercialsuppliers
(SigmaChemical Co.,St. Louis,MO;AlltechAssociates,DeerfMd,
IL;and Radian Corp.,Austin, TX).
Extractionof meconiumspecimens for screening
Severalprocedures were investigated for the extraction of the
fivedrugclassesfrom meconiumincluding extraction with buffer
solution, extraction with different organic solvents, or a combi-
nation of buffer and solvent, as well as methods which involved
partitioning ofthe extracts for further cleanup. The method used
forspecimen extraction and preparation usingthe EMIT-ETSTM
at
lowcutofflevels(SchemeI) is described.
In a prelabeled and preweighed 16 x 100-mm glass test tube,
sufficient meconium was transferred to weigh I g (_+0.02 g),
keeping the walls ofthe tube as clean as possible and the meco-
nium as close to the bottom of the tube as possible. The tubes
were briefly centrifuged in order to force the meconium to the
bottom of the tube. Each sample was homogenized with 3 mL
methanol using a sonic disrupter and immersing the microtip
approximately 5 mm below the surface of the methanol. Dis-
ruption wasperformedfora 30-s cycleat 80% pulsingand a max-
imum microtip power setting of 5. The cycle was repeated as
necessary, making sure that all meconium had been thoroughly
disrupted. The microtip was cleaned with methanol between
tubes to prevent cross-contamination.When all ofthe tubes had
been disrupted, the tubes were centrifuged (3000 to 6000 rpm)
for 10 min. Two milliliters of the clear supernatant methanolic
solutionwas transferredto a clean 12x 75-mm glasstube labeled
with the same specimen number. The solvent was evaporated
using the centrifugal vacuum concentrator. The centrifugal
vacuum concentrator was operated at room temperature for at
least 30 min before increasing the temperature to 40~ After
completely drying, the tubes were removed from the concen-
trator and 0.67 mL of methanol were added to each tube, vortex
mixed, and sonicated (water sonicator or sonic disrupter), and
then centrifuged for 5 min. From each tube, 0.5 mL of the
methanol extract was transferred to another tube (avoidinl

(250 pL) was added to the residue with vortex mixing, followed
by 250 pL of EMITbuffer,and the tube was capped and vortex

Calibratorsandcontrols
Calibratorswereprepared byspikingcertifiedblank meconium
specimens with a standard solution containing THCCOOHand
PCP at 1 pg/mLand benzoylecgonine,amphetamine, and mor-
phine at 10 pg/mL in methanol to produce desired concentra-
tions. The spiked calibrators were extracted with the described
procedure. For routine batch analysisofspecimens,two calibra-
tors were prepared at 20 and 30 ng/g ofTHCCOOHand PCPand
200 and 300 ng/g of benzoylecgonine, morphine, and amphet-
amine. Apositivecontrol that was preprepared by spiking blank

Results
This investigation was carried out in 1992 to develop pro-
cedures for the analysis of cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and phencyclidine in meconium at low cutoff
levelsforthe purposeofdetermining or confirmingprenatal drug
exposure.The study was part ofa broad research effortto deter-
mine the effectof prenatal exposure to drugs ofabuse on infant
development.
Thegoalsofthis report includeddevelopmentandvalidationof
sample preparation method(s) and immunoassay procedures for
the simultaneous analysisoffivedrugclassesat lowercutofflevels
than normally used in commercial urine drug testing. In addi-
tion, development and validation of GC-MS confirmation
methods for the different drugs or metabolites was an integral
part ofthis effort.
Although a few publications appeared in the literature at the
time this work was completed,they mainly focusedon the anal-
ysisofcocaine(10-15).
Development of a samplepreparationmethodforscreening
Several methods were examined for the extraction of meco-
nium specimens spiked with the fivedrug metabolite classes.
Manyof these methods provedto be inefficient,inconsistent, or
fraught withproblemsthat rendered them uselessfor meconium
extraction.
Extraction with buffersolution. A relatively large volume of
buffer was found to be needed for extraction which has the
inherent problem of sample dilution and, therefore, reduced
assaysensitivity.
Extraction with methanol followedby evaporation of the
439

methanol extract and reconstitution of the residue in the
screeningassaybufferpriorto analysis.Although the methanol
extraction proved to be efficient, the methanol extract was
extremelydifficultto reconstitute in the buffermaking it impos-
sible to bring the final concentration to the equivalent of I g
meconium per I mL of final solution. The final solution was
opaque in many cases, even after centfifugation, which resulted
in maximum background signals on the TDx (FPIA)assay and
invalidresults on the EMIT-ETSsystem(EIA).Furtherdilution of
the extract was necessaryto avoidthis problem. Dilution of the
final extract reduced assaysensitivity.In addition, especiallyfor
THCCOOH,verylowrecovery(< 20%)wasobserved.
Extraction with methanolcontaining5% DMSOfollowedby
evaporation of the methanol and reconstitution ofthe DMSO
solutionoftheextractin theassailbuffer.The addition ofDMSO
to methanolwasdesignedto keepthe drugsin solutionwhilethe
methanolwasbeing evaporated.Althoughthis technique seemed
to improvethe recoveryofTHCCOOH,the colorofthe finalsolu-
tion was still too dark to analyzeby either TDxor EMITwithout
further dilution.
Extraction with methanolfollowedby evaporationofthe sol-
ventanddirectreconstitution ofthe residuein a 1:1mixture of
methanolandassaybuff~ This method providedbetter overall
recoveryof all the drugs. However,dilution ofthe final solution
withat leastan equalvolumeofrnethanol/buffer(1:1)wasneces-
sary.For the EMITsystem,this dilution levelwasadequate forall
assays to obtain satisfactory results without any incident of
invalidresults. However,for the TDx,dilution of the solution of
the extract with two volumes of the methanol/buffer (1:1)was
necessary for the amphetamines, cannabinoids, and phencycli-
dine assays.
In addition, several methods were evaluated for carrying out
the extraction with different solvents. These included shaking,
vortexmixing,sonicating (low-powerwater sonicator),and sonic
disruption. Sonic disruption was found to providethe most con-
sistent mixingofmeconiumwith the extractionsolvent.
Subsequent to the evaluationofthese methodsand in an effort
to providea finalsolution ofthe extract that wouldbe equivalent
to I g meconiumper I mL final solution, an extraction method
was devised which was modeled after the GC-MS extraction
method. The acidic and basic fractions followinga partitioning
scheme of a crude methanol extract were prepared where THC-
COOHwasanalyzedin the acidicfraction and all other four drug
classes in the basicfraction. Although this procedure produced
relativelyclean extracts and adequate sensitivity,the procedure
wastoo elaboratefora screening method.
The finalextraction methodwas the result ofcareful observa-
tion of the behavior of the methanolic extracts in the previous
trials. It was noticed during the evaporation of the methanol
extract of meconiumthat, in some cases, a precipitate appears
early in the evaporation process; this precipitate went back in
solution as the extract became more concentrated. The implica-
tions were that the precipitated material might not be very sol-
uble in methanol but soluble in water. Therefore, as more
methanol evaporated and the concentration ofwater increased,
the residue became more soluble.Asa result ofthis observation,
1 g rneconium was extracted with methanol, the extract was
evaporated to dryness, and the residue was sonicated in 1 mL
methanol. Centrifugation of the final solution provideda clear,
lightbrownliquidthat appearedto beofmuch lowercolorinten-
sitythananyofthe direct extractspreviouslyprepared.Fromthis
solution, 0.5mLwaswithdrawn, the solventwasevaporated,and
the residue was reconstituted in 250 laLmethanol followedby
250 pL assaybuffer.Analysisofthis material on both EMIT-ETS
(d.a.u.) and TDx (FPIA)showed no invalidresults or maximum
background, respectively. Therefore, it was decided that this
extraction procedure be validatedfor preparation of meconiurn
extracts for screening purposes. The procedure is outlined in
Scheme I. It was noticed throughout this study that unless the
extracts were diluted to the extent of 1 g to 2 mL or more, the
TDxassaygavefrequent invalidresults due to maximumback-
groundforTHC,amphetamines, and PCRTherefore,forthe pur-
pose of this report, only the data for the EMIT(d.a.u.)assayare

ETS (d.a.u.) system. The calibration curves were prepared by
spiking1g meconiumwith 0,5, 10,20,30,and 60 pLofthe stan-
dardsolutionpreviouslydescribed,whichresultedinthefollowing
drug/metaboliteconcentrations:0,50,100,200,300,and 600ng/g
benzoylecgonine;0, 50, 100,200,300,and 600 ng/gmorphine; 0,

amphetamine;and 0, 5,10, 20,30,and 60ng/gTHCCOOH.
In addition, urine specimenswere spikedwith the same stan-
dard solution at 0, 5, 10, and 20 pL/mL, and a mixture of
methanol and assay buffer (1:1)was alsospiked with the same
standard solution at 0 and 20 lat,/mL.The urine and buffersolu-
tions were analyzed at the same time as the calibration curve
specimens to provide points of reference for comparison. The
concentrations of the urine samples were as follows:0, 50, 100,
and200ng/rnLbenzoylecgonine;0, 50,100, and 200ng/mLmor-
phine; 0, 5, 10, and 20 ng/mL PCP; 0, 50, 100,and 200 ng/mL
amphetamine;and 0, 5, 10,and 20 ng/mLTHCCOOH.
The concentrations of the buffer solutions were as follows:
0 and 200 ng/mLbenzoylecgonine;0 and 200 ng/mL morphine;
0 and 20 ng/mLPCP;0 and 200 ng/mLamphetamine; and 0 and
20 ng/mLTHCCOOH.
The datapresented in TableI showedthat the extractionproce-
dure outlined in SchemeI providedsufficientseparationbetween
the negative and reasonably low levelsof the fivedrug classes.
These separations were found to be in excess of the minimum
separationsrecommendedbythe manufacturer betweennegative
and cutofflevelsfor urine analysisas shownin TableII.The data
also showedthat the extraction procedure provided meconium
extracts with a linear relationship between the amount of the
drugs spiked in meconium and the response of the EMIT-ETS
system. The correlation coefficients(r) for the fivedrug classes
ranged from 0.9737 to 0.9973 and are shown for each assay in
Table I. Therefore,the extraction method outlined in Scheme I
provideda reliablemethodforthepreparationofmeconiurnspec-

Determination of the specificity of the opiates, cocaine,
and cannabinoid assaysat low cutoff levels
Specificityof the opiatesassay.The specificityof the Opiates
Assay for the EMIT-ETSsystem was carried out for codeine,
hydrocodone,hydromorphone, and 6-monoacetylmorphine.The
assayresponse for differentlevelsofthe listedanalyteswas com-
paredto the responseofmorphinesolutions madeat 100and 200
ng/mL, and the percent cross-reactivityfor each analyte at each
cutofflevelwas calculated (TableIII).Similar data were acquired
for the TDx assay. All solutions were made in a mixture of
methanol and assaybufferat a ratio of 1:1.
Specificityof the cocaineassay.The specificity
ofthe cocaineassayforthe EMIT-ETSsystemwas
carried out for cocaineand cocaethylene. The
assay response for different levels of the listed
drugswascomparedto the responseofbenzoylec-
gonine solutions made at 100and 200 ng/mL.All
solutionswere madein a mixture ofmethanoland
assay buffer at a ratio of 1:1. The percent cross
reactivities for each analyte were calculated at
each cutoff leveland the data are summarized in
TableIII. Similar data were acquired for the TDx
assay.
Specificity of the cannabinoids assay. The
specificityofthe cannabinoidsassayforthe EMIT-
ETS system was carried out for A9-THC,11-OH-
A9-THC, 8~-OH-A9-THC, and 813,11-diOH-A
9-
THC.The assayresponsefor differentlevelsofthe
listed analytes was compared to the response of
THCCOOHsolutions made at 10 and 20 ng/mL.
Allsolutions were made in a mixture ofmethanol
and assay buffer at a ratio of 1:1. The percent
cross-reactivitiesfor each analytewere calculated
at each cutoffleveland the data summarized in
Table III. Similar data were acquired for the TDx
assay.
The cross-reactivity data for the four cannabi-
noids generally demonstrated almost equal or
better cross-reactivitytoTHCCOOHatthe 10-and
20-ng/mL levels. Therefore, these metabolites
could be major contributors to the overall
immunoassay response.
Determination of intra-assayprecision. Four-
teen 1-g meconiumsamples from a blank batch
were extractedand analyzedbyEMIT-ETS(d.a.u.)
according to the procedure outlined under
Scheme Iforthe fivedrugclassesto determine the
intra-assay precision for each drug. In addition,
another 141-g samplesfromthe sameblankbatch
were each spikedwith 30 ~Lofthe standard solu-
tion containing I pg/mL of PCP and THCCOOH
and 10~g/mLofbenzoylecgonine,morphine, and
amphetamine. Therefore, each sample was made
to contain 30 ng/g each of PCP and THCCOOH
and 300 ng/g each ofbenzoylecgonine,morphine,
and amphetamine. Each ofthese sampleswasalso
extracted and analyzed by the EMIT-ETS(d.a.u.)

Validation of the screening procedure by GC-MS analysis of
both positive and negative specimens for all five drug classes
Twenty-fiveclinicalmeconiumspecimenswerescreenedbythe
procedure for cocaine, opiates, cannabinoids, PCP,and amphet-
amines describedhereandwerealsosubjectedto GC-MSanalysis
foreach ofthe fivedrug classes.
Table VII shows a comparison of the test results by both
methods. It was found that the number ofpositiveswas too low
and that more specimens needed to be considered.On the other
hand, none of the specimens screening negative for any of the
drugs waspositivebyGC-MS.
Analysis of meconium specimens for cannabinoids, cocaine,
opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine after the screening
and GC-MS outlined procedures
The EMIToETSprocedure described was used to screen 70
meconiumspecimens for the fivedrug/metabolite classesusing
the lowcalibratoras the cutoffpoint (20 ng/g forTHCCOOHand
PCP and 200 ng/g for morphine, benzoylecgonine, and
amphetamine). Anypresumptive positivefor any drug classwas
subsequentlyanalyzedbyGC-MSforone or more ofthe analytes
in TableVIat the LODshown for each analyte. The resuffs are
shown in TableVIII.
Fromthe group of70specimensdiscussed,fivespecimensthat
screened negative in each drug classwere submitted to GC-MS
analysisto determine ifany falsenegativeswere obtained. In all
cases,the GC-MSanalysisshowednegativeresults. For cocaine,
an additional fivespecimens that had immuno-
assay response between 100 and 200 ng/g were
analyzed by GC-MS. There was no detectable
amount ofbenzoylecgoninein four out ofthe five
specimens.Therewas21 ng/gbenzoylecgoninein
one specimen that screened above100 ng/g but
below200 ng/g.
Discussion
This study was initiated to develop a sample
extraction method for meconium specimens
which allows the extract to be screened by an
immunoassay for cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates,
amphetamines, and PCP,at cutoffvalues lower
than those previouslyused by other investigators
(2,4,11,15,17) and without interferences. Meth-
anolwas usedas the initialextractionsolvent,and
the dried extractwas re-extractedwith methanol,
leavingbehindasolidresidue.Thelatterappearsto
have been responsible for most of the invalid
results obtained when the methanol extract was
used without further purification. Methanol and
other loweralkylalcoholshavelong been used to
extractdrugsofabuse,especiallyTHC,frombiolog-
icalspecimenssuch as feces(18,19).

Prior to this work, the use of methanol to extract meconium
specimens for direct immunoassay analysis involveda dilution
factor which loweredthe sensitivityof the assay.Ostrea and co-
workers (2) extracted0.1 g meconiumwith 0.4 mLmethanol fol-
lowed by direct RIA analysis of the centrifuged and filtered
extract,a fivefolddilution. Therefore,at an assaysensitivityof 10
ng/mL, the effectiveassaysensitivityfor meconiumwould be 50
ng/g. Methanol was also used in extraction of meconiumspeci-
mensin a mixturewith phosphate buffer(20%methanolin 0.1M
buffer, pH 6.4-6.8) followed by immunoassay analysis of the
extract (17).Thesensitivityreported forthe analysisofmorphine,
cocaine,amphetamines, and cannabinoidswas60, 50, 50, and 50
ng/mL,respectively.Becausethe amountofmeconiumextracted
was0.2--0.5gand thevolume ofmethanol-bufferused forextrac-
tion was 2-5 mL (a dilution factor of 10),the effectiveassaysen-
sitivity for meconiumwould be 600, 500, 500, and 500 ng/g,
respectively.The procedure developedunder this investigation
provides a final solution (extract) equivalent to 1 mL/g meco-
nium; therefore, no dilution factor is involved.
Although the assaysensitivitywas far belowthe cutoffvalues
usedin this study,the cutofflevelswereselectedto offerimproved
sensitivitywhileminimizingthe numberofunconfirmedpositives.
GC--MSprocedures were also developedand validatedto con-
firmthe immunoassaypresumptivepositives.For GC-MSconfir-

Aspart ofthe validationprocessofthe screeningprocedure,25
clinical meconium specimens were analyzed both by the
immunoassaymethodand the GC-MSmethodsforalldrugs, and
the resultsare shown in TableVII.In addition,70 specimenswere
screened, and only those found to be positivewere subjected to
GC-MSanalysisfor the drug(s) forwhichthey screened positive
(TableVIII).Fromthe negativespecimensinthis group,fivespec-
imens were again subjected to GC-MSanalysisfor all drugs to
ascertain if there were any falsenegatives.None ofthese speci-
mensshowedany detectableamountofanyofthe drugs/metabo-
litestested.
Severalobservationscould be made fromthe resultspresented
inTablesVIIandVIII:(1)Therewasno presumptivepositivespec-
imen for PCP and, therefore, no correlation could be made
betweenthe screeningmethodandthe GC--MSconfirmation. (2)
Amphetamines showed zero confirmation rate by GC-MS,sug-
gestingthepresenceofother cross-reactingcompoundsin meco-
nium orthattheir metabolites in meconiumare differentthan in
urine. (3) Cannabinoidshad a lowconfirmation rate (40%),sug-
gesting possible contribution of other THCmetabolites to the
overallimmunoassayresponse inthe totalabsence,orinthe pres-
ence ofsmallamounts,ofTHCCOOHbelowits detection levelby
the GC-MS method. (4) Although the confirma-
tion rate for benzoylecgonine was relatively
higher (67%), one-third of the specimens
screening positiveat 200 ng/ghad no detectable
level of this metabolite byGC-MS. This, again,
suggests the possibility ofthe contribution of
other cocaine metabolites in meconium to the
overallimmunoassay response.(5) Theconfirma-
tion rate of 75% for morphine and codeine was
1~176 acceptable because the EMITopiates antibody
1~176 may cross-react with other opiates besides the
1~176 onestestedin thisstudy.

1oo% GC-MS analysisof fivemeconium specimens
1oo% that screenedabove100ng/gbut below200 ng/g

specimens screening above 100 ng/g had no
detectableamountsofbenzoylecgoninesuggested
that other cocainemetabolitesbesidesbenzoylec-
goninemay havesignificantlycontributed to the
immunoassayresponse.Thiswas foundto bethe
casewhen Steeleetal. (20)reportedthepresence
of m-hydroxybenzoylecgonine in meconium,

Conclusions
In conclusion,the describedscreeningprocedureoffersa fast,
accurate,and reliablemethod for identi~ing presumptiveposi-
tivemeconiumspecimensand emphasizesthe importanceofcar-
rying out GC-MS confirmation of positive screens prior to
reportingtest results.In addition,the GC-MSconfirmationpro-
ceduresfor cocaineand cannabinoidsshould includeadditional
metabolites besides benzoylecgonine and THCCOOH,respec-
tively.
