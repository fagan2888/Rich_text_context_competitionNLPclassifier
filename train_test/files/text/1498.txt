Homophily, the tendency of people to associate with others similar
to themselves, is observed in many social networks, ranging from
friendships to marriages to business relationships, and is based on a
variety of characteristics, including race, age, gender, religion, and
education. We present a technique for distinguishing two primary
sources of homophily: biases in the preferences of individuals over
the types of their friends and biases in the chances that people meet
individuals of other types. We use this technique to analyze racial
patterns in friendship networks in a set of American high schools
from the Add Health dataset. Biases in preferences and biases in
meeting rates are both highly significant in these data, and both
types of biases differ significantly across races. Asians and Blacks are
biased toward interacting with their own race at rates >7 times
higher than Whites, whereas Hispanics exhibit an intermediate bias
in meeting opportunities. Asians exhibit the least preference bias,
valuing friendships with other types 90% as much as friendships
with Asians, whereas Blacks and Hispanics value friendships with
other types 55% and 65% as much as same-type friendships, respec-
tively, and Whites fall in between, valuing other-type friendships
75% as much as friendships with Whites. Meetings are significantly
more biased in large schools (>1,000 students) than in small schools
(<1,000 students), and biases in preferences exhibit some signifi-
cant variation with the median household income levels in the coun-
ties surrounding the schools.
friendships | high schools | homophily | segregation | social networks
Friendship networks from a sample of American high schools in
the Add Health national survey exhibit a strong pattern: stu-
dents tend to form friendships with other students of their same
ethnic group at rates that are substantially higher than their pop-
ulation shares (Fig. 1) (1­4). This feature, referred to as "homo-
phily" in the sociological literature (5), is prevalent across many
applications andcan have important implications for behaviors (6­
9). The widespread presence of homophily indicates that friend-
ship formation differs substantially from a process of uniformly
random assortment. Two key sources of homophily are (i) biases in
individual preferences for which relationships they form and (ii)
biases in the rates at which individuals meet each other. It is
important to identify whether homophily is primarily due to just
one of these biases or to both because, for instance, this can shape
policies aimed at producing more integrated high schools. In this
article, we present a technique for identifying these two biases, we
apply this technique to the Add Health dataset, and we estimate
how preference and meeting biases differ across races.
Although there is substantial evidence that race is a salient fea-
ture in how people view each other (10), such evidence does not sort
out the sources of homophily, other than indicating that student
preferences could be a factor. Without detailed and reliable data on
the mechanics of which students meet which others, these questions
are not answered by a direct analysis of friendship data. Moreover,
surveys of students asking them about their racial attitudes may not
reliably reflect the choices that they make. To this end, we use a
technique that is well established in economics for estimating con-
sumers' preferences: revealed preference theory (11). One infers
preferences of the individual by careful observation of the choices
that they make based on the opportunities that they have. We adapt
these techniques for the analysis of social behavior and friendship
formation.Hereweinferstudents'preferencesbyobservinghowthe

and opportunities. Using a parameterized version of this model, we
are able to distinguish between the two primary sources of homo-
phily (that is, preference bias and meeting bias), and to measure
their relative magnitudes and how these differ across races. The
results illustrate these techniques and the factors leading to homo-
phily and racial segregation patterns in friendships.
Results and Discussion
There are two patterns of homophily in the Add Health data that
are important to understand (Fig. 1). First, not only is there sub-
stantial homophily, but it follows a nonlinear and nonmonotone
trend with respect to group size, with low levels of homophily for
groups that form very large or small fractions of a school and
higher levels of homophily for groups that form an intermediate
sized fraction of a school. Second, homophily patterns differ sig-
nificantly across races and by school size (see SI Text, Fig. S1, and
Tables S1­S3 for a statistical analysis).
The model of friendship formation developed in ref. 3 showed
how preference biases and meeting biases lead to different pat-
terns in the numbers of friendships that people form and the
resulting homophily. Thus, by taking advantage of those differ-
ences in patterns, one can identify preference and meeting biases.
Here we enrich and extend the model in such a way to be able to
identify race-by-race differences in these biases. Students enter the
system and randomly meet friends, leaving the process when
expected gains from new meetings are outweighed by the cost of
searching. One key element is that students have preferences over
the racial mix of their friends. Students can value a friendship with
someone of their own race differently from a friendship with
someone of another race. The second element is that students may
end up meeting other students of their own race at a rate that is
higher than what would occur if they were meeting other searching
students uniformly at random. This bias may stem from the various
ways in which the meeting process can depart from a uniform
random process, including self-segregation through racially
homogeneous activities, as well as meeting friends of friends, etc.

Details about the model and the way in which we estimate it from
the data are found in Material and Methods and SI Text.
We find that all racial groups exhibit significant biases in both
their preferences over friendships and in the rate at which they
meet students of their own race. Moreover, there are significant
differences across races in the relative biases.
Estimated biases in preferences range from one extreme where
Blacks value friendships with students of other races 55% as much
as those with other Blacks, to the other extreme where Asians
value friendships with students of other races 90% as much as
those with other Asians; Hispanics and Whites fall in between at
65% and 75%, respectively.
Estimated biases in meetings range from Whites meeting students
withoutanybias,toAsiansandBlacksexhibitingmeetingbiasesof7­
7.5, and Hispanics at an intermediate rate of 2.5. To interpret the
meeting biases: a meeting bias of 7 is such that >90% of the people
that Asians meet are other Asians in a case where Asians comprise
50% of the population. The meeting bias of 2.5 is such that >70% of
the people that Hispanics meet are other Hispanics, in a case where
Hispanics comprise 50% of the population.
These results suggest that the differences across ethnic groups in
both the homophily patterns and in the total number of friends
(see SI Text for the statistical analysis of these differences) are
explained by differences in both types of biases. For instance, the
estimates suggest that Blacks' homophily stems from both sig-
nificant meeting and preference biases, whereas Whites' homo-
phily is more driven by preference bias.
An additional relevant issue is the potential influence of
school size on observed behavior. Hypothetically, it could be that
differences across races are driven by general differences in
behavior in large versus small schools, which could correlate with
the racial makeup of a school and therefore potentially drive our
results. We therefore control for school size, splitting the sample
in "large" and "small" schools (as described in more detail
below). Although controlling for school size does not affect the
conclusions discussed above, it is interesting to note that larger
schools exhibit significantly higher biases in the rates at which
students meet students of their own race. This is consistent with
more opportunities to self-segregate in large schools, where
academic tracking and the availability of specialized clubs, ath-
letics, and extracurricular activities, and other mechanisms,
could bias meetings (13­19). To the extent that more integrated
friendship patterns are a goal for policy, the higher bias in
meetings that is observed with larger schools provides some
support for the opinion expressed in some of the recent sociology
literature that smaller schools offer some advantages.
We also perform an analogous control for the income level
surrounding a school. We split the sample into "high" and "low"
income schools, where high corresponds to schools that are in
counties with median household incomes above $30,000 in the
1990 census, and low corresponds to schools in counties below
this level. Again, controlling for income levels does not change
the basic patterns observed in the preference and meeting biases,
but we do see significant differences in preference biases
between high and low income schools, although the differences
in meeting biases do not differ significantly. We see less pref-
erence bias for some races (Hispanics and Whites) in higher
income schools and the reverse for Blacks.
Fig. 1. Homophily as a function of the fraction of a school's population that a group comprises, differentiating by race (A) and school size (B). The homophily
index, due to Coleman (12), is a normalized measure of the difference between the observed racial mix of friendships and the expected mix if friendships were
formed uniformly at random. An index of 0 indicates that students in a given group (each datum is a racial group within 1 of 84 schools) have friendships dis-
tributed according to the racial mix of the society, whereas an index of 1 indicates that the students only form friendships with other students of their own race.
Letting wi
be the fraction of race i in a given school, and qi
be the fraction of their friendships on average that are of own-type, the index is (qi

Larger schools also offer some advantages, as there may be economies of scale and it
may also be easier to draw more racially balanced populations in larger districts. The
significant increases in meeting biases in large schools, however, suggest that either one
might want to create schools within schools, or understand the factors leading to in-
creased meeting biases and homophily in larger schools.

Materials and Methods
Here we describe the model and empirical analysis, referring to SI Text for
technical details.
In our model a population of agents is partitioned into K different groups,
where group definitions delineate the relevant characteristics that agents care
about in forming friendships. Let wi
denote the fraction of the population that
is of type i. Agents have preferences over the number of friends that they have
from their owngroup,henceforthreferred to as "same-type" friends, and from
other groups, henceforth referred to as "different-type" friends. Let si
and di
denote the number of same-type and different-type friends that a repre-
sentative agent in group i has, and let ti
= si
+ di
be the agent's total number of
friends. The agent's preferences are represented by a utility function,
Ui
ðsi
; di
Þ ¼ ðsi
þ 
i
di
Þa; [1]
where both i
and  lie between 0 and 1, so that Ui
is increasing in both si
and di
.
The function Ui
measures the utility or satisfaction drawn from one's friend-
ships. The parameter i
captures the bias in preferences, with i
< 1 indicating
that different-type friends are valued less than same-type friends. The
parameter  captures diminishing returns to friendships overall: doubling the
number of each type of friends that an agent has results in less than double the
utility. Finally, agents only distinguish between same-type and different-type
friends, as is roughly consistent with empirical evidence (20­23).
Friendship formation takes place via a meeting process in which agents
randomly meet potential friends, perhaps in a biased manner. The meeting
process can be thought of as a sort of "party" where agents come to the party
and randomly meet other agents and then eventually leave the party once the
benefit from meeting more friends nolongerexceeds theopportunity cost (c >
0) of time and resources of staying at the party. The relevant meeting
parameter from an agent's decision perspective is the expected rate at which
he/she will meet same-type versus different-type friends at the party. For type
i, these are denoted by qi
and 1 ­ qi
, respectively. If preferences are biased
so that i
< 1 and same-type friendships yield higher marginal values than
different-type friendships, then a higher matching rate qi
provides higher
incentives to form additional friendships. In this case, groups that meet their
own types at higher rates (face higher qi
) at the party will choose to stay at the
party longer and thus form more friendships per capita than groups that meet
their own types at lower rates. The meeting rates for different races and total
numbers of friendships are both observable in the data, allowing us to identify
the preference parameters. Note also that choice and chance feed back upon
each other: given biased preferences groups accounting for a larger share of
the population will choose to stay at the party longer (i.e., socialize more) and
so end up forming an even greater portion of people at the party, thus making
it even more attractive for their types and less attractive for other types. This
feedback does not prevent us from identifying preference and meeting biases,
as described below.
Solving the model requires determining the meeting probabilities. If
meetings follow a uniform random process (in which case we talk of an
"unbiased" meeting process), agents meet each other in proportion to their
relative stocks (i.e., proportions at the party), so that qi

is the stock of agents of type i. Biases in meetings, such that agents meet
same friends at higher rates than their relative stocks, are captured by

; [2]
where i
> 1 is the bias that each type has toward itself in the meeting process,
and i
= 1 is the case of unbiased process. For instance, if a group comprises half
of the meeting pool and has a bias of i
= 2, then it would meet itself at a rate of
(0.5)1/2 or 0.7, while if i
= 3 this rises to 0.8, and at i
= 6 is 0.9. Given that
the stocks of different types in the meeting process must sum to one,

i

We also impose conditions that relate meeting rates across races, since if a
person of type i is meeting a person of type j then the converse is also true,
as described in SI Text. The meeting process is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Using this model, we estimate the preference bias and meeting bias
parameters from the data. If an agent forms ti
friendships when a fraction of qi
are of same-type, then the resulting utility (including costs of time in the
meeting process) is (ti
qi
+ i
(1 ­ qi
)ti
) ­ cti
. Thus, utility optimization (see SI Text
for details) implies that for every type i the following first order necessary
condition holds:

From Eq. 4, we see that i
dictates how sensitive thetotal number offriends of a
given agent is to changes in the odds of meeting a same-type agent. If there is
not much preference bias (i.e., a i
near 1), then the number of friendships
formed is relatively insensitive to the rate at which same-type friends are met.
In contrast, if preferences are heavily biased toward own-type (i.e., i
is lower),
then the number of friendships formed will be very sensitive to the rate at
which same-type friends are met. This is a key to the identification: the sen-
sitivity of the number of friendships formed by a given type of agent to the
same-type meeting rate identifies the bias in preferences. The identification of
the meeting biases can then be found from Eq. 3. To see why it identifies the
meeting biases, note that it implicitly keeps track of the extent to which the
relative fraction of types met (the qi
s) differ from the relative stocks at
the `party' (the wi
s weighted by the ti
s).
As described in SI Text, we allow for individual idiosyncrasies in preferences
and other perturbations, by allowing Eq. 4 to only hold up to an individual
error term, and we also allow costs to vary by school. Applying condition 4 to
any pair of types i and j, we can eliminate the cost term (which is unobserved in
the data) and obtain the following equation:

hence the variance in errors which are coming from individual choices (as

errors follow a Normal distribution, and in SI Text, Fig. S2, we verify that the
realized distribution of errors does not differ significantly from a Normal dis-
tribution. We search over a grid to find parameters that minimize this weighted
sum of squared errors. To estimate the  parameters, we follow the same tech-
nique based on Eq. 3. Results are reported in Table 1.
The patterns across race differ significantly. Asian students are the least
biased in their preferences over racial mixes, having the highest  at 0.9, but

they face a very substantial meeting bias with a  parameter of 7. Blacks
exhibit the greatest bias in both preferences and meetings, with a  of 0.55
and a  of 7.5. Hispanics are intermediate in terms of both biases, while
Whites have an intermediate preference bias and no meeting bias.
To check that these differences reflect a systematic heterogeneity and not
the mere effect of randomness, we run a series of F-tests on the above
calibrations, as described in SI Text and Tables S4­S7. A summary of the
results appears in Table 2. The hypothesis that all of the races have unbiased
preferences is rejected well above the 99% confidence level. Moreover,
Asian and White preference biases do not differ significantly from each
other, and the same holds for Blacks and Hispanics, but Blacks and Hispanics
both differ significantly from both Asians and Whites. Similar patterns are
found in the meeting biases, but this time with Asians and Blacks having
indistinguishable meeting biases but both differing significantly from His-
panics and Whites.§
Beyond the analysis above, we also control for the effect of school size on
the estimated parameters, as well as income. We analyze the effect of school
size by re-estimating the model, when the schools are divided into a category
of large schools (with >1000 students) and small schools (with <1000 stu-
dents). We can then compare the estimated preference and meeting biases
by school size. As reported in Table 3, larger schools exhibit significantly
higher meeting biases (at the 99% level) than small schools, but differences
in preference biases between small and large schools are insignificant (even
at the 90% confidence level). In particular, meeting biases are greater for
Blacks and Hispanics in large compared to small schools, but lesser for Asians
in large compared to small schools. We also checked whether the patterns in
biases are sensitive to the median household income level in the school's
county, since it turns out that income shows very little correlation with
school size in these data. Again, we divided schools into two categories,
those in which the county level median household income level was above
$30,000 in the 1990 census, and those for which it was below that level. As
reported in Table 4, in this case preference biases differ significantly (at the
99% level) across the high and low income-level schools, but the meeting
biases do not differ significantly (even at the 90% confidence level) across
the high and low income-level schools. Here we see Hispanic and White
exhibiting more bias in preferences (i.e., having lower 's) in low income
schools and there is more bias overall in low income schools (when esti-
mating a single bias parameter), although Blacks exhibit slightly more
preference bias in high income schools.
Further study is needed to understand the sources of preference and
meeting biases, why they differ across races, and why they are correlated with
school size and median income. Moreover, the racial categorization here is
quite coarse,¶ and many other attributes can also affect friendship formation.
In addition, we note that our analysis might even underestimate preference
biases, since meeting biases could incorporate some aspects of choice, and
since meetings are partly endogenous given that students have some choice as
to which clubs to join, which sports to participate in, which parties to go to, and
so forth. Indeed, there is a positive correlation between inbreeding homophily
and the number of clubs and athletic activities that a school has (a correlation
of 0.26 which is significant at the 99% confidence level).k
Beyond this, it would be interesting to extend the revealed preference sort
of techniques used here to incorporate the sort of network induced
homophily effects found by Kossinets and Watts (24, 25), who show the
importance of proximity in an existing social network for the formation of
new friendships.**
Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the "revealed preference" techniques
applied here can be employed in many other settings; by specifying an

§In SI Text we also report estimation of these biases when restricting attention to groups
with minimal weights in the population, as well as estimations of the meeting biases by
estimating Eq. 2 on a race-by-race basis, rather than as a joint estimation procedure as
we use under Eq. 3. These provide biases that are similarly significantly above 1, but with
some compression and variation in the differences across races.
¶The coarseness could lead the preference biases of some racial groups to be underesti-
mated. For example, the "Asian" group includes Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese,
Indian, and many other populations under one umbrella. To the extent that their racial
preferences differ by the finer ethnic categorizations, it could be that this leads their
friendship patterns with other categories to look similar to the same group, and so leads
to a higher  parameter than would be estimated if data were available on finer cate-
gorizations. This might account for the significant differences between Asian preference
bias and some of the other groups' biases.
kWe consider activities that have at least two student members and discard the few
students who claimed to be involved in 20 or more clubs or sports with some having
claimed to be involved in all possible activities.
**It is worth emphasizing that the terms "choice homophily" and "preferences," as used
in the empirical literature on homophily, generally refer to some conditional likeli-
hood, or log odds ratios, of forming ties based on some characteristics, rather than
explicit modeling of a maximization of a utility function as we have done here. Thus, a
hybrid of the sort of model analyzed here together with the network evolution and
constraints that network structures place on the meeting process as analyzed in refs. 24
and 25 could be quite valuable.
