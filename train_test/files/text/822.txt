Highlighting resource inequality, social processes, and spatial inter-
dependence, this study combines structural characteristics from the
1990 census with a survey of 8,872 Chicago residents in 1995 to predict
homicide variations in 1996-1998 across 343 neighborhoods. Spatial
proximity to homicide is strongly related to increased homicide rates,
adjusting for internal neighborhood characteristics and prior homicide.
Concentrated disadvantage and low collective efficacy-defined as the
linkage of social control and cohesion-also independently predict
increased homicide. Local organizations, voluntary associations, and
frienaYkinship networks appear to be important only insofar as they
promote the collective efficacy of residents in achieving social control
and cohesion. Spatial dynamics coupled with neighborhood inequali-
ties in social and economic capacity are therefore consequential for
explaining urban violence.
Over the course of the past century, criminological research in the eco-
logical tradition has continually discovered the concentration o
f interper-
sonal violence in certain neighborhoods, especially those characterized by

poverty, the racial segregation of minority groups, and single-parent fami-
lies.' Still, fundamental questions remain about what it is that communi-
ties "supply" (or fail to supply) that may explain the link between these
structural features of neighborhood environments and the rates of violent
crime. The traditional or perhaps idyllic notion of local communities as
"urban villages" characterized by dense networks of personal social ties
continues to pervade many theoretical perspectives on neighborhood
crime. Yet such ideal typical neighborhoods appear to bear little resem-
blance to contemporary cities where weak ties prevail over strong ties and
social interaction among residents is characterized by increasing instru-
mentality. The urban village model is also premised on the notion that
networks of personal ties and associations map neatly onto the geographic
boundaries of spatially defined neighborhoods, such that neighborhoods
can be analyzed as independent social entities. By contrast, modern
neighborhoods are often less distinctly defined with permeable borders.
Social networks in this setting are more likely to traverse traditional eco-
logical boundaries, implying that social processes are not neatly contained
in geographic enclaves.
In short, despite marshalling impressive evidence that neighborhoods
matter even in the modern city, criminologists by and large continue to
rely on the classic urban-village metaphor to explain why. This paper
builds on recent criminological research to integrate key dimensions of
neighborhood-level structure, process, and spatial embeddedness that may
help to explain the puzzle of crime's ecological concentration. In particu-
lar, we incorporate local institutional processes related to voluntary
associations and local organizations, along with extra-local processes
related to the spatial dynamics of violent crime. We integrate these
dimensions of the urban landscape with a theoretical framework highlight-
ing the role of social control and cohesion-even if not rooted in strong
personal ties-and neighborhood structural inequality. Our focus on ine-
quality centers on the extreme concentration of socioeconomic resources
at both the upper and lower tails of the distribution.
SOCIAL DISORGANIZATION THEORY
AND BEYOND
Our approach draws its motivation from an intellectual tradition that
seeks to explain variation in rates of crime and violence. In their classic
work, Shaw and McKay (1942) argued that low economic status, ethnic

lence. For summaries, see Land et al. (1990),Peterson and Krivo (1993). and Sampson
and Lauritsen (1994).
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 519
heterogeneity, and residential instability led to community disorganiza-
tion, which in turn accounted for delinquent subcultures and ultimately
high rates of delinquency. It was not until the 1970s and 1980s,however,
that social disorganization was defined explicitly as the inability of a com-
munity structure to realize the common values of its residents and to main-
tain effective social controls (Bursik, 1988; Kornhauser, 1978; Sampson
and Groves, 1989). This theoretical definition of social disorganization has
been formulated in systemicterms-that is, the local community is viewed
as a complex system of friendship, kinship, acquaintanceship networks,
and associational ties rooted in family life and ongoing socialization
processes (Bursik and Grasmick, 1993a; Kasarda and Janowitz, 1974).
More recently, the intellectual tradition of community-level research
has been revitalized by the increasingly popular idea of "social capital."
Although there are conflicting definitions, social capital is typically con-
ceptualized as embodied in the social ties among persons and positions
(Coleman, 1990:304). Putnam defines social capital as "features of social
organization, such as networks, norms, and trust, that facilitate coordina-
tion and cooperation for mutual benefit" (1993:36). Whatever the specific
formulation, the sources of social capital stem not from the attributes of
individuals but from the structure of social organization. The connection
of systemic social disorganization and social capital theory has been articu-
lated by Bursik (1999): Neighborhoods bereft of social capital (e.g., inter-
locking social networks) are less able to realize common values and
maintain the informal social controls that foster safety.
The intuitive appeal of social capital notwithstanding, there are reasons
to problematize the process by which strong social ties translate into low
crime rates. First, in some neighborhood contexts, strong ties may impede
efforts to establish social control. Wilson (1996), for example, has argued
that many poor neighborhoods where residents are tightly interconnected
through network ties do not produce collective resources such as the social
control of disorderly behavior. His research suggests that disadvantaged
urban neighborhoods are places where dense webs of social ties among
neighbors may impede social organization: "[Ilt appears that what many
impoverished and dangerous neighborhoods have in common is a rela-
tively high degree of social integration (high levels of local neighboring
while being relatively isolated from contacts in broader mainstream soci-
ety) and low levels of informal social control (feelings that they have little
control over their immediate environment, including the environment's
negative influences on their children)" (pp. 63-64). In her study of a black
middle-class community in Chicago ("Groveland"), Pattillo-McCoy (1999)
also acknowledges the limits of tight-knit social bonds in facilitating social
control. She argues that although dense local ties promote social integra-
tion, they also foster the growth of networks that impede efforts to rid the
MORENOFF ET AL.
neighborhood of drug- and gang-related crime: "Because Groveland is
very stable, thick kin, neighborly, and friendship ties are the norm. These
networks positively affect both the informal and formal supervision of
youth. ...But at the same time that dense social ties are good, they also
have negative repercussions. . .for organized criminal enterprises" (p. 70).
A second reason that it is problematic to assume a simple connection
between strong social ties and low crime rates is that in many urban com-
munities, shared expectations for social control are maintained in the
absence of thick ties among neighbors (Sampson et al., 1999). Strong ties
among neighbors are no longer the norm in many urban communities
because friends and social support networks are decreasingly organized in
a parochial, local fashion (Fischer, 1982; Wellman, 1979). Moreover, as
Granovetter (1973) argued in his seminal essay, "weak ties"-i.e., less inti-
mate connections between people based on more infrequent social inter-
action-may be critical for establishing social resources, such as job
referrals, because they integrate the community by bringing together oth-
erwise disconnected subgroups. Bellair (1997) extended this logic to the
study of community crime by demonstrating that weak ties among neigh-
bors, as manifested by less frequent patterns of social interaction, are pre-
dictive of lower crime rates. Research on dense social ties thus reveals
somewhat of a paradox for crime theory. Many urbanites interact with
their neighbors on a limited basis and thus appear to generate very little
social capital. Moreover, urbanites whose strong ties are tightly restricted
geographically may actually produce an environment that discourages col-
lective responses to local problems.
To address these changes in urban reality, Sampson et al. (1997, 1999)
proposed a focus on mechanisms that facilitate social control without
requiring strong ties or associations. As Warren (1975) noted, the com-
mon belief that neighborhoods have declined in importance as social units
"is predicated on the assumption that neighborhood is exclusively a pri-
mary group and therefore should possess the `face-to-face,' intimate, affec-
tive relations which characterize all primary groups" (p. 50). Rejecting
this outmoded assumption about the function of local communities, Samp-
son et al. (1997) highlighted the combination of a working trust and shared
willingness of residents to intervene in social control. This linkage of trust
and cohesion with shared expectations for control was defined as neigh-
borhood "collective efficacy." Just as self-efficacy is situated rather than
global (one has self-efficacy relative to a particular task), a neighborhood's
efficacy exists relative to specific tasks such as maintaining public order.
Viewed through this theoretical lens, collective efficacy is a task-specific
construct that highlights shared expectations and mutual engagement by
residents in local social control (Sampson et al., 1999). Moving from a
focus on private ties to social efficacy signifies an emphasis on shared
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 521
beliefs in neighbors' conjoint capability for action to achieve an intended
effect and, hence, an active sense of engagement on the part of residents.
As Bandura (1997) argues, the meaning of efficacy is captured in expecta-
tions about the exercise of control, elevating the "agentic" aspect of social
life over a perspective centered on the accumulation of stocks of
resources. This conception is consistent with the redefinition of social cap-
ital by Portes and Sensenbrenner as "expectations for action within a col-
lectivity'' (1993:1323).
Distinguishing between the resource potential represented by personal
ties, on the one hand, and the shared expectations among neighbors for
engagement in social control represented by collective efficacy, on the
other, may help clarify the systemic model. In particular, social networks
foster the conditions under which collective efficacy may flourish, but they
are not sufficient for the exercise of control (see also Bursik, 1999). Thus,
collective efficacy may be seen as a logical extension of systemically based
social disorganization and social capital theory. The difference is mainly
one of emphasis: Although we recognize and incorporate below the rele-
vance of systemic networks for neighborhood social organization, we
argue that collective capacity for social action, even if rooted in weak per-
sonal ties, may constitute the more proximate social mechanism for under-
standing between-neighborhood variation in crime rates.
RESEARCH STRATEGY AND NEW DIRECTIONS
In this paper, we strive to make both substantive and methodological
contributions to neighborhood-level research on violence. Our integrated
framework builds on the insights derived from social disorganization,
social capital, and collective efficacy theory, coupled with a "routine activi-
ties" emphasis on the explanation of crime events. Criminal events
require the intersection in time and space of three elements-motivated
offenders, suitable targets, and the absence of capable guardians (Cohen
and Felson, 1979). As such, crime can be ecologically concentrated
because of the presence of targets or the absence of guardianship (e.g.,
collective efficacy), even if the pool of motivated offenders is more evenly
distributed across the city. We are thus interested in how neighborhoods
fare as units of guardianship and collective efficacy; the outcome is the
event rate of homicide victimization. Applying this framework, we high-
light two neglected dimensions of neighborhood context: (1) spatial
dynamics arising from neighborhood interdependence, and (2) social-insti-
tutional processes.
522 MORENOFF ET AL.
SPATIAL DYNAMICS
Contrary to the common assumption in ecological criminology of ana-
lytic independence, we argue that neighborhoods are interdependent and
characterized by a functional relationship between what happens at one
point in space and what happens elsewhere. Spatial interdependence is
theoretically motivated on three grounds. First, we expect it to arise as a
result of the inexact correspondence between the neighborhood bounda-
ries imposed by census geography and the ecological properties that shape
social interaction. One of the biggest criticisms of neighborhood-level
research to date concerns the artificiality of boundaries; for example, two
families living across the street from one another may be arbitrarily
assigned to live in different "neighborhoods" even though they share
social ties. From the standpoint of systemic theory, it is important to
account for the social and institutional ties that link residents of urban
communities to other neighborhoods, particularly those that are more spa-
tially proximate to their neighborhood. Spatial models address this prob-
lem by recognizing the interwoven dependence among (artificial)
neighborhood units. The idea of spatial dependence thus challenges the
urban village model, which implicitly assumes that geographically defined
neighborhoods represent intact social systems that function as islands unto
themselves, isolated from the wider sociodeomographic dynamics of the
city.
Second, spatial dependence is implicated by the fact that homicide
offenders are disproportionately involved in acts of violence near their
homes (Block, 1977; Curtis, 1974; Reiss and Roth, 1993). From a routine
activities perspective, it follows that a neighborhood's "exposure" to homi-
cide risk is heightened by geographical proximity to places where known
offenders live (see also Cohen et al., 1981). Moreover, to the extent that
the risk of becoming a homicide offender is influenced by contextual fac-
tors such as concentrated poverty, concentrated affluence, and collective
efficacy, spatial proximity to such conditions is also likely to influence the
risk of homicide victimization in a focal neighborhood.
A third motivation for studying spatial dependence relates to the notion
that interpersonal crimes such as homicide are based on social interaction
and thus subject to diffusion processes (Cohen and Tita, 1999; Messner et
al., 1999;Morenoff and Sampson, 1997;Rosenfeld et al., 1999;Smith et al.,
2000). Acts of violence may instigate a sequence of events that leads to
further violence in a spatially channeled way. For example, many homi-
cides, not just gang-related, are retaliatory in nature (Black, 1983; Block,
1977). Thus, a homicide in one neighborhood may provide the spark that
eventually leads to a retaliatory killing in a nearby neighborhood. In addi-
tion, most homicides occur among persons known to one another (Reiss
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 523
and Roth, 1993),usually involving networks of association that follow geo-
graphical vectors.
There is, then, reason to believe that spatial dependence arises from
processes related to both diffusion and exposure, such that the characteris-
tics of surrounding neighborhoods are, at least in theory, crucial to under-
standing violence in any given neighborhood. The diffusion perspective
focuses on the consequences of crime as they are played out over time and
space-crime in one neighborhood may be the cause of future crime in
another neighborhood. The concept of exposure focuses on the antece-
dent conditions that foster crime, which are also spatially and temporally
ordered. Although both concepts provide strong justification for analyz-
ing spatial dependence, criminological research has been surprisingly slow
to adapt tools of spatial analysis, especially in a regression framework that
accounts for a competing explanation of clustering-selection effects
based on population composition (see also Rosenfeld et a]., 1999;Smith et
al., 2000). In this paper, we therefore focus on the independent effect of
spatial proximity on the likelihood of homicide, accounting for key struc-
tural and social characteristics of life within the boundaries of focal
neighborhoods.
INFORMAL AND INSTITUTIONAL PROCESSES
Our second major goal is to integrate the study of neighborhood mecha-
nisms identified by Mayer and Jencks (1989) with regard to informal and
institutional social processes. Neighborhood-level social processes are not
easy to study, of course, because the sociodemographic characteristics
drawn from census data and other government statistics typically do not
provide information on the collective properties of administrative units.
Building on some of the pioneering efforts at direct measurement of social
control (e.g., Hackler 'et al., 1974; Macoby, 1958) a growing number of
studies have thus turned to original survey-based approaches to assess
neighborhood-level social ties and associations. For example, Taylor et al.
(1984:316) constructed block-level measures of the proportion of respon-
dents in 63 Baltimore neighborhoods who belonged to an organization to
which coresidents also belonged, and the proportion of respondents who
felt responsible for what happened in the area surrounding their home.
Both measures were significantly and negatively related to rates of vio-
lence, exclusive of other ecological factors (p. 320). A similar pattern
emerged in Simcha-Fagan and Schwartz's (1986) study of 553 residents of
12 neighborhoods in New York City during the mid-1980s. They found a
significant negative relationship between the rate of self-reported delin-
quency and the rates of organizational participation by local residents (p.
683).
Drawing on data collected from more than 300 communities in Great
524 MORENOFF ET AL.
Britain in 1982 and 1984,Sampson and Groves (1989) found that the den-
sity of local friendship networks was associated with lower robbery rates,
whereas the level of organizational participation by residents was linked to
lower rates of robbery and stranger violence (p. 789). The prevalence of
unsupervised teenage peer-groups in a community had the largest associa-
tions with rates of robbery and violence by strangers. Variations in these
dimensions of community social organization were shown to mediate, in
part, the effects of community socioeconomic status, residential mobility,
ethnic heterogeneity, and family disruption. In a similar study from the
United States, Elliott et al. (1996) examined survey data from Chicago and
Denver. A measure of "informal control" was negatively related to ado-
lescent problem behavior in both sites, and like the British results, infor-
mal control mediated the prior effects of neighborhood structural
disadvantage. Residentially unstable and poor neighborhoods displayed
less social control, and they in turn suffered higher delinquency rates.
A number of studies have used survey data from 5,302 Seattle residents
nested within 100census tracts (Miethe and Meier, 1994) to investigate the
connection between social processes and crime. Warner and Rountree
(1997) found a significant negative association between assault rates and
the proportion of respondents in white neighborhoods who engaged in
neighboring activities with one another-including borrowing tools or
food, having lunch or dinner, or helping each other with problems. In a
subsequent study, Rountree and Warner (1999) examined the gendered
nature of neighboring and found that the proportion of females engaging
in neighboring activities was behind the association with lower rates of
violent crime. Bellair (2000) approached the same data with a somewhat
different perspective on social processes. He assumed that neighboring
activities affect crime rates only indirectly, by increasing the likelihood
that neighbors will engage in informal surveillance of one another's prop-
erty. These causal paths were consistent with the results he obtained from
a structural equation model.
Recently, Sampson et al. (1997) undertook a survey of 8,782 residents of
343 Chicago neighborhoods in 1995. Combining scales tapping mutual
trust/cohesion and shared expectations for social control, they found that a
summary measure of "collective efficacy" was associated with lower rates
of violence, controlling for concentrated disadvantage, residential stability,
immigrant concentration, and a set of individual-level characteristics (e.g.,
age, sex, SES, race/ethnicity, home ownership). Concentrated disadvan-
tage and residential instability were also linked to lower collective efficacy,
and the association of disadvantage and stability with violence was signifi-
cantly reduced when collective efficacy was controlled. These patterns are
consistent with the inference that neighborhood structural characteristics
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 525
influence violence in part through the construct of neighborhood collec-
tive efficacy.*
In short, most neighborhood studies to date have focused on social ties
and interaction to the exclusion of organizations (see Peterson et al.,
2000). For example, Sampson et al.'s (1997) test of collective efficacy high-
lighted cohesion and mutual expectations among residents for control.
But as noted earlier, communities can exhibit intense private ties (e.g.,
among friends, kin), and perhaps even shared expectations for control, yet
still lack the institutional capacity to achieve social control (Hunter, 1985).
The institutional component of social capital is the resource stock of
neighborhood organizations and their linkages with other organizations.
Similar to the idea of "bridging" social capital, Bursik and Grasmick
(1993a) also highlight the importance of public control, defined as the
capacity of community organizations to obtain extralocal resources (e.g.,
police protection; block grants; health services) that help sustain neighbor-
hood stability and control. It may be that high levels of collective efficacy
come about because of such controls, such as a strong institutional pres-
ence and intensity of voluntary associations. Or it may be that the pres-
ence of institutions directly accounts for lower rates of crime. Only a few
studies have examined voluntary associations (e.g., Simcha-Fagan and
Schwartz, 1986;Taylor and Gottfredson, 1984),and almost none a commu-
nity's organizational base (for an exception, see Peterson et al., 2000). In
addition to incorporating the spatial dynamics of interpersonal violence,
structural characteristics, and the systemic dimensions of collective effi-
cacy and social ties, we therefore address this gap by simultaneously exam-
ining institutional density and the intensity of local voluntary associations
as reported by residents.
DATA SOURCES
The data on neighborhood social processes stem from the Community
Survey of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
(PHDCN). The extensive social-class, racial, and ethnic diversity of the
population was a major reason Chicago was selected for the study. Chi-
cago's 865 census tracts were combined to create 343 "Neighborhood
2. Homicides that result from domestic disputes or spousal abuse may seem to be
unrelated to the social processes related to collective efficacy. However, as Browning
(2001) demonstrates, women in collectively efficacious neighborhoods are more likely
to disclose incidents of abuse and assaultto their neighbors, protecting themselves from
being victimized by further violence. Collective efficacy is also related to lower homi-
cide rates among intimate partners. Thus, the span of collective efficacy appears to
extend beyond street-level or public encounters (Sampson et al., 1997:918) to the case
of partner violence "inside the home."

Clusters'' (NCs) composed of geographically contiguous and socially simi-
lar census tracts. NCs are smaller than Chicago's 77 community areas
(average size = 40,000) but large enough to approximate local neighbor-
hoods, averaging around 8,000 people. Major geographic boundaries (e.g.,
railroad tracks, parks, freeways), knowledge of Chicago's local neighbor-
hoods, and cluster analyses of census data were used to guide the construc-
tion of relatively homogeneous NCs with respect to distributions of racial-
ethnic mix, SES, housing density, and family structure. The Community
Survey (CS) of the PHDCN was conducted in 1995, when 8,782 Chicago
residents representing all 343 NCs were personally interviewed in their
homes.3 The basic design for the CS had three stages: At stage 1, city
blocks were sampled within each NC; at stage 2, dwelling units were sam-
pled within blocks; and at stage 3, one adult resident (18 or older) was
sampled within each selected dwelling unit. Abt Associates carried out the
screening and data collection in cooperation with PHDCN, achieving an
overall response rate of 75%.
To assess collective efficacy, we replicated Sampson et al. (1997) and
combined two related scales. The first is a five-item Likert-type scale of
shared expectations for social control. Residents were asked about the
likelihood that their neighbors could be counted on to take action if chil-
dren were skipping school and hanging out on a street corner, children
were spray-painting graffiti on a local building, children were showing dis-
respect to an adult, a fight broke out in front of their house, and the fire
station closest to home was threatened with budget cuts. Social cohesion/
trust was measured by asking respondents how strongly they agreed that
"People around here are willing to help their neighbors"; "This is a close-
knit neighborhood"; "People in this neighborhood can be trusted"; "Peo-
ple in this neighborhood generally don't get along with each other"
(reverse coded); and "People in this neighborhood do not share the same
values" (reverse coded). Social cohesion and informal social control were
strongly related across neighborhood clusters (r = 30) and, following
Sampson et al. (1997), were combined into a summary measure of the
higher order construct, "collective efficacy." The aggregate-level or
"ecometric" reliability (see Raudenbush and Sampson, 1999) of collective
efficacy was 35.4
3. By neighborhood, the survey protocol stated: "we mean the area around where
you live and around your house. It may include places you shop, religious or public
institutions, or a local business district. It is the general area around your house where
you might perform routine tasks, such as shopping, going to the park, or visiting with
neighbors."

THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 527
In addition to the cohesion and control scales that define collective effi-
cacy, our analysis takes into account institutional neighborhood processes
and social networks. Organizations is an index of the number of survey-
reported organizations and programs in the neighborhood-the presence
of a community newspaper, block group or tenant association, crime pre-
vention program, alcohol/drug treatment program, mental health center,
or family health service. Voluntary associations taps the "social capital"
involvement of residents in (1) local religious organizations; (2) neighbor-
hood watch programs; (3) block group, tenant associations, or community
council;(4) business or civicgroups; (5) ethnic or nationality clubs; and (6)
local political organizations. The measure of social tiednetworks is based
on the combined average of two measures capturing the number of friends
and relatives (each coded 0, 1-2, 3-5, 6-9, 10 or more) that respondents
reported living in the neighborhood.
Unlike the full-count census measures described below, our community
survey measures of social process are based on only about 25 respondents
per neighborhood cluster. Moreover, there are differential missing data
by items in the scales. To account for measurement error and missing
data, we employ the empirical Bayes (EB) residuals of the key survey-
based predictors-collective efficacy, social ties, organizations, and volun-
tary associations. EB residuals are defined as the least-squares residuals
regressed toward zero by a factor proportional to their unreliability (Bryk
and Raudenbush, 1992:42). Using EB residuals as explanatory variables
corrects for bias in regression coefficients resulting from measurement
error (Whittemore, 1989).
STRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS
Based on the 1990 census and our theoretical framework, we examine
five neighborhood structural characteristics. All scales are based on the
summation of equally weighted z-scores divided by the number of items;
factor-weighted scales yielded the same results. Concentrated disadvan-
tage represents economic disadvantage in racially segregated urban neigh-
borhoods. It is defined by the percentage of families below the poverty
line, percentage of families receiving public assistance, percentage of
unemployed individuals in the civilian labor force, percentage of female-
headed families with children, and percentage of residents who are black.
These variables are highly interrelated and load on a single factor using
size (n) in each of the j neighborhoods and (2) the proportion of the total variance that
is between-groups ( T ~ )
relative to the amount that is within-groups (
d
)
.
A magnitude
of greater than .SO suggests that we are able to reliably tap parametervariance in collec-
tive efficacy at the neighborhood level. For further discussion of tools for assessing
ecological context, see Raudenbush and Sampson (1999).
MORENOFF ET AL.
either principal components or alpha-scoring factor analysis with an
oblique rotation (see also Sampson et al., 1997:920). This result makes
sense ecologically, reflecting neighborhood segregation mechanisms that
concentrate the poor, African Americans, and single-parent families with
children (Bursik and Grasmick, 1993b; Land et al., 1990; Massey and
Denton, 1993; Wilson, 1987).
In such a segregated context, it is problematic at best to try to separate
empirically the influence of percent black from the other components of
the disadvantage scale, for there are in fact no white neighborhoods that
map onto the distribution of extreme disadvantage that black neighbor-
hoods experience (Krivo and Peterson, 2000; Sampson and Wilson, 1995).
For example, if one divides Chicago into thirds on concentrated poverty,
no white neighborhoods in Chicago fall into the high category (Sampson
et al., 1997). Even though traditional in criminology, regression models
that enter both percent black and disadvantage thus assume a reality
counter to fact. We address this race issue in two ways. First, we assess
whether the structural, social, and spatial processes specified in our models
vary across regimes defined by racial composition. In other words,
although we cannot reliably disentangle the direct effects of race and dis-
advantage, we address the possibility that racial composition interacts with
other variables. Second, we test the robustness of main results, other than
disadvantage, to traditional controls for percent black.
Focusing on the pernicious effects of concentrated disadvantage, while
obviously important, may obscure the potential protective effects of afflu-
ent neighborhoods. After all, concentrated affluence may be more than
just the absence of disadvantage. Recent years have seen the increasing
separation of affluent residents from middle-class areas (Massey, 1996), a
phenomenon not captured by traditional measures of poverty. Moreover,
Brooks-Gunn et al. (1993) argue that concentrated affluence generates a
separate set of protective mechanisms based on access to social and insti-
tutional resources. The resources that affluent neighborhoods can mobil-
ize are theoretically relevant to understanding the activation of social
control, regardless of dense social ties and other elements of social capital
that may be present. In support of this notion, recent work has demon-
strated the importance of measuring the upper tail of the SES distribution
when analyzing structural characteristics and youth outcomes (Brooks-
Gunn et al., 1993; Sampson et al., 1999). We thus extend our focus by
introducing a measure that captures the concentration of both poverty and
affluence. The index of concentration at the extremes ("ICE") (Massey,
2001) is defined for a given neighborhood by the following formula:
[(number of affluent families - number of poor families) / total number of
families], where "affluent" is defined as families with income above
$50,000and "poor" is defined as families below the poverty line. The ICE
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 529
index ranges from a theoretical value of -1 (which represents extreme
poverty, namely, that all families are poor) to +1(which signals extreme
affluence, namely, that all families are affluent). A value of zero indicates
that an equal share of poor and affluent families live in the neighborhood.
ICE is therefore an inequality measure that taps both ends of the income
distribution, or as Massey (2001:44) argues, the proportional imbalance
between affluence and poverty within a neighborhood.
Other structural covariates include the relative presence of adults per
child (ratio of adults 18+ to children under 18) and population density
(number of persons per square kilometer). We also build on Sampson et
al. (1997) by examining two additional structural characteristics long noted
in the ecological literature. Residential stability is defined as the percent-
age of residents five years old and older who lived in the same house five
years earlier, and the percentage of homes that are owner-occupied. The
second scale captures areas of concentrated Latino immigration, defined by
the percentage of Latino residents (in Chicago, approximately 70% of
Latinos are Mexican-American) and percentage of persons foreign born.
VIOLENCE MEASURES
To eliminate method-induced associations between outcomes and
predictors, we examine two independent measures of homicide relative to
our survey-based approach to measuring social process and our census-
based approach to measuring structural covariates. We analyze homicide
as an indicator of neighborhood violence both because of its indisputable
centrality to debates about crime and because it is widely considered to be
the most accurately recorded of all crimes. Our principle data source
comes from reports of homicide incidents to the Chicago Police Depart-
ment. These data consist of aggregate homicide counts that have been
geocoded to match the neighborhood cluster in which the events occurred.
We use the homicide count data from two time periods, the years 1991to
1993 and the years 1996 to 1998.5 Because homicide is a rare event, we
construct rates based on three-year counts for both periods to reduce mea-
surement error and stabilize rates. We replicate the main analysis on a

Homicide data from 1991-1993 were downloaded from the Chicago Homicide Data Set
at the ICPSR data archive (http:llwww.icpsr.umich.edu).Homicide data from both
time periods come from police counts, also compiled by Richard Block, that were
geocoded based on the address where the incident occurred. The homicide counts for
each neighborhood cluster includes cases of non-negligent manslaughter but excludes
deaths that result from injuries inflicted by the police or other law-enforcing agents.
There is one difference between the homicide data from the two time periods. In the
latter period (199&1998), the homicide count for each neighborhood cluster is based
on the number of "incidents" that occurred there, where each incident may contain one

person-based measure of homicide victimization in 1996derived from vital
statistics rather than from police records.6 The original source here was
death-record information found in the coroner's report and recorded in
vital statistics data for Chicago, which were geocoded based on the home
address of the victim.' To the extent that basic patterns are similar across
recording systems with obviously different error structures, we can place
increased confidence in the results of independently measured predictors.
Nevertheless, we privilege the incident-based homicide measure from
police statistics as our primary outcome because our theoretical perspec-
tive, grounded in the social control of routine activities, places its analytic
focus on the neighborhood factors that may suppress the occurrence of
homicide events within its boundaries.
Sampson et al. (1997) analyzed violence measured at the same time
(1995) as the survey of collective efficacy, meaning that the outcome could
have influenced the alleged explanatory factors. By contrast, we assess the
ability of our model to predict future variations in violence. Specifically,
the census-based factors (1990) and survey-based processes (1995) were
measured temporally prior to the event counts of homicide in 1996-1998.
Moreover, we address the potential endogeneity of collective efficacywith
respect to past violence by explicitly controlling for the rate of violent
events in 1991-1993. It may be that neighborhood social trust and
residents' sense of control are undermined by experiences with crime,
most notably, interpersonal crimes of violence and those committed in
public by strangers (Bellair, 2000; Liska and Bellair, 1995;Skogan, 1990).
Ours is a strict test because the strong temporal dependence in violence
(e.g., the correlation between 1991-1993 and 1996-1998 is .79 for inci-
dence rates) may yield unduly conservative estimates of any of the
or more victims. This contrasts with the 1991-1993 homicide data, in which the ncigh-
borhood count is based on the number of victims that were murdered in each neighbor-
hood in a given year. The two sets of measures are very highly correlated. however, and
multiple-victim incidents are rare.
6. We did not have access to vital statistics data for 1997 or 1998, so our two
measures of homicide do not cover exactly the same time period. Homicides in the vital
statistics are coded as causes of death due to injuries inflicted by another person with
intent to injure or kill, by any means. As was the case with the police statistics. these
homicide data include non-negligent manslaughter but exclude injuries inflicted by the
police or other law-enforcing agents (National Center for Health Statistics, 2000).
A long history of research on homicide has shown that victims tend to be killed
in or very near to their neighborhoods of residence. For homicide, then, the victimiza-
tion rate also serves as a proxy for homicide incidence. This assumption is validated by
the high correlation between vital statistics and the police-recorded incidence of homi-
cide events. The correlation between the homicide rate calculated from vital statistics
from 1996 data and that calculated from the police statistics for 1996-1998 is .71. The
correlation between homicide rates calculated on the two data sets for 1991-1993
(which we use in the analysis as independent variables) is .86.

predictors. This procedure also gives us some purchase on controlling for
prior sources of crime not captured in our measured variables.8
STATISTICAL MODELS
There are three major features of our approach and data that must be
represented in our statistical model: the conception of the outcome as a
count of rare events (homicides); the likely unexplained variation between
neighborhoods in the underlying latent event rates; and the spatial embed-
dedness of neighborhood processes. Our model views the homicide count
Y,for a given neighborhood as sampled from an overdispersed Poisson
distribution with mean nili,where ni is the population size in 100,000sof
neighborhood i and l, is the latent or "true" homicide rate for neighbor-
hood i per 100,000people. We view the log-event rates as normally distrib-
uted across neighborhoods. However, we conceive of these log-event rates
as spatially autocorrelated. More specifically,using a hierarchical genera-
lized linear model approach (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989;Raudenbush et
al., 2000), we set the natural log link qj = log(l,) equal to a mixed linear
model that includes relevant neighborhood covariates, a random effect for
each neighborhood, plus a spatial autocorrelation term. Thus, our model
for the neighborhood log homicide rate conforms to an overdispersed
Poisson distribution.
The advantage of this approach is threefold. First, it sensibly incorpo-
rates the skewed nature of the homicide outcome, which has many values
of zero, while creating a metric that defines meaningful effect size.
Namely, exponentiating the regression coefficient in such a model and
multiplying the result times 100 produces the useful interpretation of "the
percent increase in the homicide rate associated with a one unit increase in
the predictor." Second, the approach represents unique, unobserved dif-
ferences between neighborhoods via random effects. To the extent that
An alternative approach to addressing the endogeneity of collective efficacy
would be to examine simultaneousequation models, but in this procedure, the choice of
instrumental variables is often very difficult to justify (see discussion in Bellair, 2000)
and the existing literature has been harshly criticized as untenable (Fisher and Nagin,
1978). The problem is that the exclusionary restrictions cannot be validated with the
data at hand. We prefer to address endogeneity through a control for prior homicide on
two grounds-no identifying restrictions are necessary, and it is a conservative test.
The latter is true because the very high stability in homicide rates over time results in
little residual variation left in the homicide rate to explain with other covariates. Also,
prior levels of social process, for which we have no measures, may have influenced prior
levels of crime and thus be mediated in their effect. However, if a significant associa-
tion between social process and homicide maintains after partialling the effect of prior
homicide, endogeneity is an implausible inference in our panel model because the
homicide outcome is measured at a later time than the predictors; crime cannot influ-
ence the past.

532 MORENOFF ET AL.
neighborhoods have unique features that affect homicide rates, these ran-
dom effects are important in accounting for variation not explainable by
the structural model. Third, the approach incorporates the spatial depen-
dence of neighborhood homicide rates.
Unfortunately, software that can simultaneously handle overdispersed
Poisson variates, random effects of neighborhoods, and spatial depen-
dence is not currently available. We therefore employed a two-step
approximation. First, we used a hierarchical generalized linear model
without spatial dependence to compute posterior modes q,* of neighbor-
hood-specific log-homicide rates given the data, the grand mean estimate
for Chicago, and the estimated between-neighborhood variance in the true
log-rates.9 Next, we imported these posterior modes into software dedi-
cated to estimating regression models with spatial dependence (Space-
Stat). Using this integrated approach, regression coefficients and
coefficients of spatial dependence have the desirable interpretation of the
ideal model described above.
We estimate spatial dependence by constructing "spatially lagged" ver-
sions of our measures of violence. We define y, as the homicide rate of NC
i, and w,,
as element ij of a spatial weights matrix that expresses the geo-
graphical proximity of NC, to NC, (Anselin, 1988:ll). For a given observa-
tion i, a spatial lag Z,w,,y, is the weighted average of homicide in
neighboring locations.10 The weights matrix is expressed as first-order
contiguity, which defines neighbors as those NCs that share a common
9. The approximate posterior mode q,' for neighborhood i is a weighted average
of that neighborhood's log homicide rate, estimated using only the data from that
neighborhood; and the overall mode of the homicide rates estimated from the data
generated by all of the neighborhoods. The weights accorded each component are pro-
portional to their precisions. The more data collected in neighborhood i, the more pre-
cise will be the estimate based on the data from that neighborhood and the more weight
it will be accorded in composing q,'. The more concentrated the neighborhood rates
around the overall mode, the more that overall mode will be weighted. Such approxi-
mate posterior modes are routinely produced as output from widely used statistical
software for multilevel analysis (cf. Raudenbush et al., 2000). The shrinkage of neigh-
borhood-specific estimates toward an overall mode is not ideal because it ignores prior
information about how neighborhoods differ in their homicide rates. In principle, this
leads to somewhat conservative estimates of the effects of neighborhood-level
covariates. To assess the extent of bias, we replicated our results using standard regres-
sion analyses with the neighborhood-based rates as outcomes. Results were very simi-
lar. We chose the approach using posterior modes because it extends better to spatial
modeling. The standard approach using the neighborhood-based rates as outcomes does
not extend well to the incorporation of spatial effects because the extreme skewness of
the neighborhood-specific rates contradicts the assumptions of the spatial regression
procedures. Using the posterior modes solves this problem and produces stable and
interpretable spatial results.
Spatial dependence may also be treated as a "nuisance," in the form of a spa-
tial error model (Anselin, 1988). The spatial lag model was chosen because it conforms

THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 533
border (referred to as the rook criterion).ll Thus, wij= 1 if i and j are
contiguous, 0 if not. We then test formally for the independent role of
spatial dependence in a multivariate model by introducing the spatial lag
as an explanatory variable. The spatial lag regression model is defined as
where y is an N x 1vector of observations on the dependent variable; W
y
is an N x 1 vector composed of elements Iiwi,yi,the spatial lags for the
dependent variable; p is the spatial autoregressive coefficient; X is an N x
K matrix of exogenous explanatory variables with an associated K x 1vec-
tor of regression coefficients/3; and E is an N x 1vector of normally distrib-
uted random error terms, with means 0 and constant (homoscedastic)
variances.12
The most straightforward interpretation of p is that for a given neigh-
borhood, i, it represents the effect of a one-unit change in the average
homicide rate of i's first-order neighbors on the homicide rate of i. This
interpretation would seem to suggest a diffusion process, whereby a high
homicide rate in one neighborhood diffuses outward and affects homicide
rates in surrounding neighborhoods. However, the notion of diffusion
implies a process that occurs over time, whereas the spatial autocorrela-
tion process modeled in Equation (1)is entirely cross-sectional-homicide
rates are spatially interrelated across neighborhoods but simultaneously
determined. Moreover, the interpretation of p as a pure diffusion (or
feedback) mechanism-the effect of a one-unit change in W
y on y-does
not capture the complexity of the spatial process specified in Equation (1).
By extending the logic of Equation (l),we can demonstrate that the spa-
tial lag model also incorporates the idea of "exposure" to the values of the
measured X variables and the E term (i.e., unmeasured characteristics) in
spatially proximate neighborhoods. According to Equation (l),the value
of y at location i depends on the values of X and E at location i and on
y = pwy + xg + E, (1)
to our theoretical approach that specifies spatial dependence as a substantive phenome-
non rather than as a nuisance (see also Tolnay et al., 1996). Moreover, the spatial lag
models generally outperformed the corresponding spatial error models in a variety of
diagnostic tests.
11. Before computing the spatial lag term, we standardized the weights matrix by
dividing each element in a given row by the corresponding row sum (see Anselin,
1995a). Defined formally as w@, wij,row standardization constrains the range of the
parameter space in such a way that the resulting coefficient is no longer dependent on
the scale of the distance employed in the weights matrix. The spatial lag parameter can
be interpreted as the estimated effect of a one-unit change in the scale of the original
variable from which it was created.
12. This model is often referred to as the simultaneous spatial autoregressive
model because the presence of the spatial lag is similar to the inclusion of endogenous
explanatory variables in systems of simultaneous equations. All estimates of the spatial
proximity models were derived using the program "Spacestat" (Anselin, 1995a).
534 MORENOFF ET AL.
values of y in i's first-order neighbors. In turn, the first-order neighbors'
values of y are functions of X and E in i's first-order neighbors and y in i's
second-order neighbors, and so on. This process continues in a step-like
fashion, incorporating the neighborhood characteristics of successively
higher order neighbors of i (see also Tolnay et al., 1996). This process can
be expressed mathematically by rewriting Equation (1) as follows:
y = xp + pwxp + p W x p +...+pnlWmxp+ E
+ PWE + p2w&+...+
P"W"E, (

where m +DJ.
Equation (2) is also known as the "spatial multiplier" pro-
cess, because it shows that the spatial regression model treats spatial
dependence as a ripple effect, through which a change in X or E at location
i influences not only the value of y at location i, but also (indirectly) at all
other locations in Chicago.
Equation (2) also shows that the spatial effect can be decomposed into
two parts: the effect of proximity to the measured X variables and the
effect of proximity to unmeasured characteristics, E. The first component
(the spatial process in the X variables) directly addresses the "proximity
hypothesis" discussed above-it estimates the extent to which homicide
rates are related to values of the measured X variables in spatially proxi-
mate neighborhoods.13 The second component of Equation (2) (the spa-
tial process in E ) is more ambiguous and depends on the model
specification. In part, this component taps the effect of spatial proximity
to unmeasured features in nearby neighborhoods that are associated with
homicide. For example, the homicide rate of the focal neighborhood may
be related to rates in surrounding areas because of overlapping social net-
works across arbitrary neighborhood boundaries. Another possibility is a
spillover effect such that the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood is
affected by the homicide rate in nearby neighborhoods directly. Therefore,
the p coefficient from the spatial lag model captures spatial exposure to
the observed X variables, spatial exposure to unobserved predictors, and
endogenous feedback effects in y.
EXPLORATORY SPATIAL DATA ANALYSIS
We begin our analysis by examining the geographic distributions of
homicide and collective efficacy across Chicago neighborhoods in an
exploratory spatial data analysis (Anselin, 1988). Consistent with much
13. Because p is multiplied by the B coefficient for each X variable in Equation (2),
and 0 5 p 5 1. it is possible to think of p as the rate at which the effects of each X
variable are "discounted" in contiguous neighbors. Thus, if p = .50, the effects of the
average level of X in the first-order neighbors (Wx)will be half as strong as they are in
the focal neighborhood. In the second-order neighbors, the effect will be reduced by
one-quarter the size of p (SO2 = .25), and so on for each successive order of contiguity.
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 535
past research, homicide events are not randomly distributed with respect
to geography. In fact, supplementary tabulations reveal that 70% of all
homicides in Chicago between 1996and 1998occurred in only 32% of the
neighborhood clusters, according to the Police data. We thus examined
the geographic correspondence between the distribution of neighborhood
homicide rates and that of collective efficacy,a key social process from our
theoretical perspective. To facilitate such a comparison, we employ a
typology of spatial association, referred to as a Moran scatterplot, which
classifieseach neighborhood based on its value for a given variable, y , and
the weighted average of y in contiguous neighborhoods, as captured by the
spatial lag term, Wy. For simplicity, neighborhoods that are above the
mean on y are considered to have "high" values of y , whereas neighbor-
hoods below the mean are classified as "low." The same distinction is
made with respect to values of Wy for each neighborhood, resulting in a
fourfold classification with the followingcategories: (1) low-low,for neigh-
borhoods that have low levels of efficacy and are also proximate to neigh-
borhoods with low levels of efficacy; (2) low-high, for neighborhoods that
have low levels of efficacy but are proximate to high levels; (3) high-low,
for neighborhoods that have high levels of efficacy but are proximate to
low levels; and (4) high-high, for areas with high levels of efficacy that are
also proximate to high levels of efficacy.
Figure 1 displays the results of the spatial typology for two variables:
collective efficacy and the 1996-1998 EB homicide rates, constructed from
the incident-based Police data. This map conveys two pieces of informa-
tion for each neighborhood. First, each neighborhood's value for the spa-
tial typology of collective efficacy is denoted by a different fill pattern:
light gray for low-low;dots for low-high;diagonal stripes for high-low; and
dark gray for high-high.14 Second, the symbols on the map represent val-
ues of the spatial typology of EB homicide rates, constructed from the
It is possible to apply a test of statistical significance for the values of this
typology, developed by Anselin (1995b). This test of local spatial association at each
location i is referred to as the local Moran statistic, defined as I,= (z,I rn2)Z,w,,z,with mz
= Z,z?, where the observations z, and z, are standardized values of y ,and y, expressed as
deviations from the mean (Anselin, 1995a, 1995b). Under a conditional randomization
approach, the value of z, at location i is held fixed, and the remaining values of z, over
all other neighborhoods in the city are randomly permuted in an iterative fashion. With
each permutation, a new value of the quantity E,w,,z, is computed, and the statistic is
recalculated. This permutation operationalizes the null hypothesis of complete spatial
randomness. A test for pseudo-significance is then constructed by comparing the origi-
nal value of I, to the empirical distribution that results from the permutation process
(Anselin, 1995b). We could not convey the information about statistical significance of
the Moran typology for collective efficacy with the limited shading scheme of a black-
and-white map-such a map entails an eightfold categorization, which is better dis-
played in color. However, the symbols on the map representing homicide hot spots
(stars) and cold spots (crosses) are based on only the statistically significant "high-high''

1996-1998 police data: Black stars indicate significant high-high values
(i.e., homicide "hot spots"), and gray crosses indicate significant low-low
values (i.e., homicide "cold spots").
We draw two general conclusions from Figure 1. First, the map shows
that there is a high degree of overlap between the spatial distributions of
collective efficacy and homicide. For example, 67 of the 93 neighborhoods
that have spatial clustering of high levels of collective efficacy (72%) also
experience statistically significant clustering of low homicide. Most of the
clustering of low homicide coupled with high collective efficacy occurs in
neighborhoods located on the western boundaries of Chicago, particularly
on the far northwest and southwest sides. Similarly, there is a strong cor-
respondence between the spatial clustering of high homicide rates and the
low levels of collective efficacy. Of the 103 homicide hot spots, 77 (or
75%) also have spatial clustering of low levels of collective efficacy. Sec-
ond, despite the strong association between the geographic distribution of
collective efficacy and homicide, there are many observations in which the
two typologies are at variance with one another. For example, 14 of the 93
homicide cold spots (15%) appear in neighborhoods with low levels of
collective efficacy that are surrounded by high levels. Moreover, 15of 103
homicide hot spots (15%) are in neighborhoods that have high levels of
collective efficacy but are surrounded by neighborhoods with low levels.
Neighborhoods where the level of collective efficacy is at variance with
surrounding neighborhoods are important theoretically because they
reveal concrete but often neglected forms of spatial advantage and disad-
vantage (Sampson et al., 1999).
The role of spatial proximity to collective efficacy is further explored in
Figure 2, which graphs the mean homicide rate for the four categories of
the collective efficacy spatial typology.15 Figure 2 reveals that regardless
of the level of collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood, mean homi-
cide rates are lower among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to
high levels of collective efficacy (as indicated by the dark gray bars) than
they are among neighborhoods that are spatially proximate to low levels
of collective efficacy (as indicated by the dotted bars). It is therefore clear
that a neighborhood's spatial proximity to collective efficacy conditions its
homicide rate, independent of its level of collective efficacy. In other

collective efficacy using the local Moran statistic.
This graph does not take into account statistical significance of Moran's I,
because very few neighborhoods are in either the low-high or high low categories and
have statistically significantvalues of Moran's I (only 6 in low-high and 11 in high-low).
These cell sizes are too small to generate reliable estimates of mean homicide rates.

words, knowing the local level of social organization is not enough, a pro-
position we now test further in a multivariate spatial analysis of homicide
rates with additional covariates.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
We turn to a regression framework to investigate three substantive
issues in the analysis of neighborhood homicide rates-the role of multiple
social processes as neighborhood mechanisms, the spatial dynamics of
homicide, and the endogeneity of collective efficacy. The Appendix
includes a correlation matrix for all of the independent variables included
in subsequent regression models along with a table displaying their means
and standard deviations. Table 1presents the results of regression models
for EB homicide rates using the Chicago Police Data. The first model
includes only the structural covariates. The natural log of the concen-
trated disadvantage index is used because scatterplots revealed a non-
linear relationship between disadvantage and homicide. The log-
transformation effectively linearizes this association.16 The results show
that all of the coefficients in this model are significant, with the exception
16. Before taking its natural log, we added a constant (1.5) to the disadvantage
scale to eliminate negative values.

of the ratio of adults to children. When social and institutional processes
are added to the regression, in model 2, only the effects of disadvantage
(positive), residential stability (positive), and density (negative) remain
significant.17 More importantly, model 2 also reveals that collective effi-
cacy is negatively related to homicide rates, as anticipated by the theoreti-
cal discussion. Somewhat unexpectedly, none of the other social or

against conventional wisdom that it should be positive. The expectation of a positive
association is probably more applicable to the city level (i.e., more densely populated

institutional process variables in model 2 are significantly related to
homicide.
Models 3 and 4 represent spatial lag regressions estimated via maximum
likelihood. Model 3 introduces the spatial lag term, which is positively
related to homicide rates and strongly significant. The introduction of the
spatial lag term in model 3 eliminates the significance of residential stabil-
ity and diminishes the effects of concentrated disadvantage (by 30%), pop-
ulation density (by 20%), and collective efficacy (by 16.5%). Model 4
adds a control for the prior neighborhood homicide rate (1991-1993) in
order to address the possibility that the association between collective effi-
cacy in 1995 and 1996-1998 homicide rates is really a reflection of the
downward spiral of neighborhoods caused by prior violence.18 The con-
trol for prior homicide reduces the magnitude of the collective efficacy
coefficient (by 13%), but it still maintains significance. The control for
prior homicide reduces the disadvantage coefficient more substantially (by
33%), but because 1991-1993 homicide rates and the logged disadvantage
index are so highly correlated (r = .90), it is difficult to disentangle their
independent effects on 1996-1998 homicide rates. More important from
the standpoint of our theoretical discussion above is that collective efficacy
and the spatial term maintain significant and strong associations with vari-
ations in future homicide unaccounted for by the stable patterns of vio-
lence as reflected in prior homicide.
The remaining models in Table 1, models 5 and 6, offer an alternative
specification of the spatial autocorrelation model with and without the
control for prior homicide. What is unique about models 5 and 6 is the
cities may indeed have higher homicide rates), but it is less applicable to the neighbor-
hood level because many of the most devastated and poor areas within cities of the
North and Midwest are those that became "depopulated" during the social dislocations
of the 1970s and 1980s (Wilson, 1987). Some areas on the West Side of Chicago, for
example, resemble virtual ghost towns yet continue to have high rates of violent crime.
We examined this relationship more closely by mapping the concentrationsof both den-
sity and homicide. The maps revealed that the association between high neighborhood
density and low homicide rates appears to be strongest in affluent neighborhoods on
the city's North Side, where there are many high-rise apartment buildings. To be sure,
there are also neighborhoods with high density and high homicide rates-such as those
with high-rise public housing-but it is more generally the case that the neighborhoods
with the highest homicide rates (e.g., on the West and South Sides) have relatively low
levels of population density. This finding dovetails with results from prior longitudinal
research in Chicago on the association between neighborhood population loss-which
tends to result in lower levels of population density-and higher homicide rates (More-
noff and Sampson, 1997). Our results also suggest that the density effect does not
appear to operate through collective efficacy, because density is strongly negatively
related to collective efficacy, as shown below in Table 4 .
18. These prior homicide rates are also based on the overdispersed Poisson distri-
bution, using the same methodology described above.
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 541
substitution of the ICE index for the disadvantage index. The ICE index
captures the degree of concentrated affluence relative to the concentration
of poverty in a neighborhood (Massey, 2001). The coefficients for collec-
tive efficacy remain statistically significant in models 5 and 6 after control-
ling for prior homicide. Significant spatial dependence also remains in
each of the models. Thus, even though they are conceptually distinct, sub-
stituting ICE for the disadvantage index does not alter the main findings.19
The larger message appears to be that concentrated inequality in socioeco-
nomic resources is directly related to homicide.
To assess robustness, Table 2 replicates the same set of models using
victim-based homicide rates for 1996 from the Chicago Vital Statistics
data. The results are similar to those from Table 1for the variables of
main theoretical interest: concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy,
spatial proximity, and the ICE index. In model 1,concentrated disadvan-
tage is the only structural variable that has a statistical association with
homicide. Unlike the results for the incident-based homicide measure,
density does not have a direct relationship with victim-based homicide.
This makes sense from a routine activities perspective, because it is a fac-
tor that is theoretically related to the point of the event's occurrence, not
to the residence of the victim.
When the social process variables are added in model 2, we again find a
significant association between homicide rates and collective efficacy, but
not for social ties or any of the institutional measures. The spatial lag
term, introduced in model 3, is significant and positively related to homi-
cide rates. The control for prior homicide is not significant in model 4,*0
but the coefficients for disadvantage, collective efficacy,and spatial depen-
dence maintain their significance. The effects associated with collective
efficacy and spatial dependence also remain significant after the substitu-
tion of the ICE index for the disadvantage index in models 5 and 6.
In sum, we find a fairly robust set of results across two independently
collected sources of homicide data: the Chicago Police Statistics and Chi-
cago Vital Statistics. Concentrated disadvantage, collective efficacy, and
the ICE index are consistently related to homicide across all models in
both Tables 1 and 2. These results obtain even after controlling for prior
19. The effect of concentrated immigration becomes significant with the substitu-
tion of the ICE measure for the logged disadvantage scale. This change across model
specifications is due in part to the fact that concentrated immigration is more highly
correlated with the logged disadvantagescale (-.33) than it is with ICE (-.03), as shown
in the Appendix.
Again, prior homicide is strongly correlated with the logged disadvantage
index (.YO), as shown in the Appendix. Consequently, as was the case in Table 1,we
cannot easily disentangle the independent effects of prior homicide and disadvantage
on homicide in 1996.

homicide rates. Strong spatial effects are also evident in both data sets,
which again remain after controlling for the strong stability in homicide
risk over time. We believe this finding is important, for one of the biggest
problems in spatially based social research is ensuring that p is not spuri-
ous due to a failure to fully specify the causal processes in a focal commu-
nity. The strength of our model is that the temporally lagged homicide
rate essentially serves as a proxy for all such unmeasured variables. Thus,
to the extent that prior homicide adjusts for the unobserved heterogeneity
of causal processes, the continued strength of the p coefficient increases
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 543
our confidence in the robustness of the effect of spatial proximity on
homicide.
FURTHER UNDERSTANDING THE SPATIAL
DYNAMICS OF HOMICIDE
To interpret the results of the spatial lag models in Tables 2 and 3, it is
important to recall that in Equation (2), homicide is related to the value of
each X variable in successively higher order neighbors by a function of p,
the coefficient for the spatial lag term. In Figure 3,we use the results from
model 4 in Tables 1 and 2 to demonstrate how this "spatial multiplier"
process works with respect to two key covariates: concentrated disadvan-
tage (which is logged) and collective efficacy.21 The bars on the left side of
the graph illustrate how the spatial multiplier process operates for concen-
trated disadvantage. The first set of bars in this series show that control-
ling for all other covariates in model 4, a one standard deviation increase
in the log of the disadvantage index in the focal neighborhood is associated
with a 40% increase in the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood
according to the Police data and a 24% increase according to the Vital
Statistics.22 The next set of bars reveals that all else being equal, a one
standard deviation increase in the average level of concentrated disadvan-
tage in the first-order neighbors of the focal neighborhood is associated
with a 9% increase in the homicide rate in the focal neighborhood accord-
ing to the Police data and a 4% increase according to Vital Statistics. The
remaining bars show that the effects of disadvantage decrease exponen-
tially with each succeeding level of contiguity. To gauge the cumulative
effect, it is possible to add all of the bars in this series for each data set.
This shows that a simultaneous one standard increase in the log of the
disadvantage index in the focal neighborhood, and in the first-, second-,
and third-order neighbors, is associated with a 52% increase in homicide
according to Police data and a 28% increase according to the Vital
Statistics.
The right side of Figure 3 displays results for the same exercise con-
ducted on collective efficacy. The coefficients for collective efficacy are
more stable across the two data sets. A one-standard deviation increase in
21. In order to obtain the percentage change in the homicide rate per standard
deviation change in the corresponding independent variable, we exponentiate the prod-
uct of each regression coefficient and the standarddeviation of the respective covariate.
22. Because the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and the homicide
rate is nonlinear, the effect of a one-standard deviation increase in disadvantage
depends on where in the distributionof disadvantage that change is evaluated. Figure 3
displays the difference in the homicide rate associated with moving from one-half of a
standard deviation below the mean of disadvantage to one-half of a standarddeviation
above the mean of disadvantage.

the level of collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood is associated with
a 12% reduction in the homicide rate according to both the Police data
and the Vital Statistics data. Cumulatively, a one standard deviation
increase in collective efficacy in the focal neighborhood, and the first-, sec-
ond-, and third-order neighbors, is associated with a 15% reduction in the
homicide rate of the focal neighborhood according to the Police data, and
a 14% drop according to the Vital Statistics.
Note that Figure 3 only displays the spatial effects associated with two
independent variables, concentrated disadvantage and collective efficacy.
A full decomposition of the spatial effect would include other variables in
the model, in addition to the error term. Thus, the effects displayed in
Figure 3 are only a fraction of the full spatial effect. What these results
show, however, is that the cumulative effects associated with both disad-
vantage and collective efficacy are substantively large, particularly when
their spatial dynamics are taken into account.
REGIMES OF RACIAL SEGREGATION
To this point, our analysis has relied on an index of concentrated disad-
vantage that includes racial composition as one of its components. As we
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 545
argued above, the high degree of racial segregation overlaid with poverty
hinders our ability to disentangle the direct effects of neighborhood racial
composition and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage in Chicago.23
However, it is possible, and we would argue more meaningful, to examine
whether the social and structural processes under study operate similarly
across neighborhoods of differing racial composition. We address this
issue by estimating spatial regime models (Anselin, 1995a), which allow
coefficients to vary across regimes defined by neighborhood racial compo-
sition while controlling for spatial dependence.24 To define these regimes,
we divide Chicago's neighborhoods into two categories based on their
1990racial composition: (1)less than 75% non-Hispanic black (henceforth
referred to as "non-black" neighborhoods) and (2) 75% or more non-His-
panic black (henceforth, referred to as "black" neighborhoods). There are
125 black neighborhoods, as defined by this typology, and they are, on
average, 96.4% black, 2.5% white, and 2.8% Hispanic. There are 217 non-
black neighborhoods, which on average are 54.3% white, 30.5% Hispanic,
and 9.4% black.25
The results of the regime model are reported in Table 3. We use ICE as
our inequality measure in these models because the disadvantage index
contains the percent black measure, which cannot be used both on the
right-hand side of the regressions and in the definition of the regimes.
Theoretically, we are interested in the proportional distribution of afflu-
ence and poverty within racial regimes. The first two columns display
results using the incident-based homicide outcome-column 1 contains
23. We did attempt to reestimate the models in Tables 1and 2 by recalculating the
disadvantage index without percent black and instead entering percent black as a sepa-
rate covariate. Our major substantive results remained intact with this alternative spec-
ification. However, the Variance Inflation Figures increased dramatically-to over 5 in
some cases for the percent black variable-indicating severe problems with mul-
ticolinearity. Nevertheless, the pattern of results for the other factors in the model was
similar (results available upon request), especially for spatial proximity and collective
efficacy.
24. The spatial regime model is a switching regression model in which the coeffi-
cients and constant term take on different values depending on the regime, and the
coefficients of each regime are jointly estimated. The model also includes a spatial lag
term that does not vary across regimes, meaning that the spatial process is assumed to
be uniform across the entire city.
25. Although we specify only two regimes, we recognize that the "non-black"cate-
gory encompasses a heterogeneous grouping of neighborhoods that may be predomi-
nantly white, predominantly Hispanic, or mixed. It is possible to expand the regime
specification to more than two regimes, but further disaggregation of the non-black
regime would result in very small sample sizes-there are only 69 neighborhood clus-
ters that were over 75% white in 1990 and only 21 that were over 75% Hispanic. We
thus present the more parsimonious two-regime specification and leave for future
research the question of what explains differences across these two regimes. Our main
interest here is the replicability of results in all black areas.

the coefficients for the non-black neighborhoods, and column 2 contains
coefficients for the black neighborhoods. In general, the results do not
differ very much across regimes in the incident-based homicide model.26
The ICE index and collective efficacy have significant negative associa-
tions with the homicide incident rate in both non-black and black neigh-
borhoods. The spatial effect, which is estimated jointly across non-black
26. Both the overall Chow test for the structural stability of the regression model
across the two regimes and the coefficient-specific Chow tests for stability across
regimes reveal that there are no significant differences across regimes. This suggests
that for incident-based homicide, the regression models for black and non-black neigh-
borhoods are not significantly different.
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 547
and black neighborhoods, is also significant and large. The main differ-
ence is that population density has a significant negative effect only in
non-black neighborhoods.
Turning to the victim-based homicide measure (columns 3 and 4), the
results yield more differences across the two regimes.27 In the victim-
based homicide model, the ICE index is significantly associated with homi-
cide only in non-black neighborhoods, whereas the association between
collective efficacy and homicide is significantonly in black neighborhoods.
Moreover, in black neighborhoods, the measures of voluntary associations
and organizations are positively associated with homicide, whereas in non-
black neighborhoods, these associations are nonsignificant.28 Again, the
spatial effect is significant. Although there is evidence of differing magni-
tudes of effect across black and non-black neighborhoods, the overall
results for collective efficacy and spatial proximity are fairly robust, taking
both homicide outcomes into account.
DISENTANGLING NEIGHBORHOOD
SYSTEMIC PROCESSES
Although the regression results affirm that collective efficacy in achiev-
ing social control is an important factor for understanding variation in
neighborhood homicide rates, they are less sanguine about the role of
social ties. Both Tables 1and 2 show that there is no independent associa-
tion between social ties and neighborhood homicide rates after controlling
for collective efficacy. These findings offer insight on the social disorgani-
zation tradition of recent neighborhood research, much of which focuses
on the role of social ties. To bring these findings into sharper relief, and
possible reconciliation, we constructed a social-process typology that clas-
sifies neighborhoods based on whether they fall above or below the
median score on the indices of social ties and collective efficacy, yielding
27. In this model, the Chow test for the structural stability of the regression model
across regimes indicates that there are significant differences in the patterns of associa-
tion across black and non-black neighborhoods. Coefficient-specific Chow tests indi-
cate that the collective efficacy effect is the only one that significantly varies across
regimes (p = .Ol), although the Chow tests for ICE (p = .08),concentrated immigration
(p = .09), and organizations (p = .08) are all marginally significant.
28. These findings are somewhat counterintuitive because they suggest that black
neighborhoods with more organizational infrastructure have higher homicide rates.
One interpretation is that the presence of organizations and voluntary associations in
black neighborhoods could be in part a response to high levels of crime, or perhaps the
greater salience of crime. However, these associations remain when controlling for
prior levels of homicide. We believe that these findings should be further investigated
in future research that includes better measures of neighborhood organizations (see
below).
548 MORENOFF ET AL.
the following four categories: low ties-low efficacy; low ties-high effi-
cacy; high ties-low efficacy; high ties-high efficacy.
We map this typology in Figure 4 and overlay on it symbols indicating
the spatial clustering of low and high homicide rates (as was done in Fig-
ure 1). From the standpoint of the systemic perspective, we expect homi-
cide rates to be lowest in neighborhoods that possess high levels of both
social ties and collective efficacy. Indeed, 41 of the 93 homicide "cold"
spots (44%) displayed on this map are located in areas that are high in
both ties and efficacy (filled in dark gray). However, 31 of the cold spots
(36%) are located in neighborhoods that are low in ties but high in collec-
tive efficacy (filled in diagonal stripes). Most of the neighborhoods where
low homicide rates are clustered despite the absence of strong social ties
are on the north side of the city. The traditional perspective on social
disorganization predicts that homicide "hot" spots should be found
predominantly in neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy.
Instead, the map shows that hot spots are divided almost evenly between
neighborhoods that are low in both ties and efficacy (40 out of 103) and
those that are high in ties and low in efficacy (38 out of 103). Dense net-
works do not appear to be necessary or sufficient in explaining homicide.
These findings do not necessarily contradict the systemic perspective, how-
ever. Integrating the collective efficacy and systemic model, we would
suggest that social ties create the capacity for informal social control, but it
is the act of exercising control that is related to crime rather than the exis-
tence of social networks per se (Bursik, 1999).
To investigate this idea further, we examine the role of social ties as a
predictor of collective efficacy by estimating the spatial regression models
presented in Table 4. The results show that the social ties index is signifi-
cantly positively associated with collective efficacy when it is introduced in
models 2-5. Moreover, the institutional variables are also important cor-
relates of collective efficacy in Table 4,even though they did not have
independent associations with homicide in Tables 1 and 2. These results
hold up after controlling for structural covariates, spatial autocorrelation,
prior homicide rates, and after substituting the ICE index for the disad-
vantage index (compare columns 1-3 with 4-5).29 Overall, these findings
29. The spatial autocorrelation term for collective efficacy becomes nonsignificant
after the social interactional and institutional process variables are added in models 2
and 3. One interpretation of this finding is that the spatial dependence term is signifi-
cant in model 1 because it captures the effects of social ties and interactions that cut
across neighborhood boundaries, along with similarities across neighborhoods on unob-
served social and institutional process variables. When these processes are directly
measured in model 2, they reduce the spatial dependence term to nonsignificance.
However, spatial proximity remains significant for collective efficacy in the ICE models
(columns 4 and 5),so this interpretation is contingent on the specification of inequality.

clarify a point that has been left ambiguous in much previous research on
the systemic model: Social ties and institutional processes appear to oper-
ate indirectly on homicide rates by fostering collective efficacy. Although
using somewhat different measures and terminology, Bellair (2000) also
reaches a similar conclusion, suggesting a general process.
CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Our results suggest that spatial embeddedness, internal structural char-
acteristics, and social organizational processes are each important for
Further understanding of the spatial dynamics of collective efficacy is beyond the scope
of this paper, but it is an issue that we believe bears emphasis.
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 551
understanding neighborhood-level variations in rates of violence. In par-
ticular, spatial proximity to violence, collective efficacy, and alternative
measures of neighborhood inequality-indices of concentrated disadvan-
tage and concentrated extremes-emerged as the most consistent
predictors of variations in homicide across a wide range of tests and empir-
ical specifications. The final and major test of these four predictors, where
two independently measured indicators of homicide (police records and
coroner's report) are analyzed in conjunction with a three-year average
rate of prior homicide controlled (model 4 in Tables 1 and 2), bears out
this conclusion. Interestingly, extreme inequality in resources-whether
measured by "underclass" disadvantage or the concentration of income at
both the upper and lower tails of the distribution (ICE)-exhibits
unmediated effects on violence despite the control for prior homicide.
The estimated direct effects of inequality and collective efficacy suggests
that structure and process at the neighborhood level may work more inde-
pendently than prior neighborhood theory has allowed (e.g., Sampson et
al., 1997).
Moreover, our analysis of racial "spatial regimes" suggested that struc-
tural characteristics and social processes have many similar effects on
homicide rates in predominantly black compared with non-black neigh-
borhoods. Although we did find some evidence of differences in coeffi-
cients across regimes-and it is noteworthy that the effect of collective
efficacy is strongest in black neighborhoods-overall the results suggest
that a fairly stable causal process is operating in all parts of the city. Put
differently, the evidence is more favorable than not to the idea that the
fundamental causes of neighborhood violence are similar across race (see
also Krivo and Peterson, 2000; Sampson and Wilson, 1995).
Against the backdrop of these patterns, we believe four points should
be emphasized, each of which carries implications for future research.
First, a great deal remains to be learned about the relationship between
social ties and crime. Future research may better understand the indirect
relationship between social ties and crime by investigating the conditions
under which strong social ties foster trust and social control.30 In his
review of community crime prevention interventions, Hope (199566-69)
suggests that the communitarian approach, which relies on dense networks
among residents to build communal solidarity, is not the only strategy for
achieving social control. An alternative approach that is more common in
the suburbs, which Hope calls "moral minimalism," achieves social control
through weak ties among neighbors by emphasizing privacy over commu-
nalism and denying strangers access to the community and its resources.
The achievement of social control in neighborhoods that lack a social
30. We thank an anonymous reviewer for raising this point.

infrastructure of strong ties among neighbors presents a challenge to sys-
temic theory that should be taken up in future research, both quantitative
and ethnographic.
The second major theme of our analysis is that homicide is a spatially
dependent process, and that our estimates of spatial effects are relatively
large in magnitude. Indeed, the spatial effects were larger than the stan-
dard structural covariates and an array of neighborhood social processes.
The tendency of past research has been to focus on internal neighborhood
factors, but they are clearly not enough to understand homicide. Local
actions and population composition make a difference, to be sure, but they
are severely constrained by the spatial context of adjacent neighborhoods.
Our results suggest that political economy theorists are right in insisting on
models that incorporate city-wide dynamics (Logan and Molotch, 1987).
Hope (199524) makes a similar point from the criminological perspective,
suggesting that many intervention efforts have failed because they did not
adequately address the pressures toward crime in the community that
derive from forces external to the community in the wider social structure.
Although very different in research style and method, the recent ethno-
graphic work of Pattillo-McCoy (1999) also parallels our findings and dis-
covery of the salience of spatial vulnerability, especially for black middle-
class neighborhoods (Figure 1). The puzzle that remains is to further dis-
entangle spatial processes into constituent parts. At this juncture, we are
unable to pinpoint the relative contributions of exposure and diffusion, an
agenda we are hopeful that criminological researchers and methodologists
will have an interest in tackling. In the meantime, spatial proximity cannot
be ignored in theories of violence.
A third theme that emerges is the potential importance of further refin-
ing our understanding of "structural covariates" that have traditionally
been linked to the poverty paradigm. Concentrated poverty is without any
doubt a risk factor for the concentration of homicide. But at the other end
of the distribution, the 1980sand 1990shave seen the quiet but increasing
separation of educated and affluent residents from the middle class. This
"upper" inequality or stratification of place has resulted in an increasing
concentration of affluence (Massey, 1996,2001), which in turn has yielded
important consequences for the distribution of homicide. Our analysis
introduced a new measure tapping such inequality of affluence relative to
poverty, with results suggesting that it does matter for the explanation of
violence. We controlled for organizations, voluntary associations, social
control, and local ties, none of which accounted for the strong and consis-
tent effect of the index of concentrated extremes. It may well be that the
protective factor of relative affluence is linked to socialization or guardian-
ship processes that are untapped in current data. Also, perhaps because of
the investment potential in affluent areas, homicide does not lead to the
THE SPATIAL DYNAMICS OF URBAN VIOLENCE 553
same cycle of decline that seems to be obtained in disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods. We hope that future investigators probe the phenomenon of
concentrated affluence in more depth, especially its interaction with racial
segregation.
Fourth, one of our goals was to integrate the institutional and informal
aspects of social process, following recent developments in systemic social
disorganization,social capital, and collective efficacy theory. Somewhat to
our surprise, however, the set of institutional processes was not that strong
in predicting homicide. Organizations and voluntary associations turned
out to be relatively unimportant, suggesting that perhaps criminological
theory has overstated the benefits to be derived from local forms of insti-
tutional organization. Another finding is that cohesion coupled with social
control seems to be the more proximate correlate of lower homicide rela-
tive to dense social ties. Further specifying the systemic model of disor-
ganization (Bursik, 1999; Bursik and Grasmick, 1993a), the theory of
collective efficacy suggests that social ties are important for crime control
insofar as they lead to the activation of social control and mutual engage-
ment among residents (Sampson et al., 1997). Our analysis, along with
other recent research (Bellair, 2000), supports this mediated view.
In conclusion, we should emphasize that perhaps the biggest limitation
of the present analysis concerns our measures of organizations and institu-
tions. Drawn from survey (self) reports, we are limited to residents' per-
ceptions of the organizations in the areas. Residents may be mistaken, of
course, suggesting that independent data are needed on the number and
type of organizations,along with their geographical jurisdictions (cf. Peter-
son et al., 2000). But probably more germane, it is not clear that the num-
ber of organizations is the key factor in social organization. Applying the
logic we used for ties and efficacy, it may be that the density of organiza-
tions is important only insofar as it generates effective action on the part
of the organizations that do exist. One can imagine a community with a
large number of dispirited and isolated institutions, perhaps even in con-
flict with one another. This is hardly a recipe for social organization, sug-
gesting that dense institutional ties are not sufficient. We therefore hope
that future research is able to make advances in two ways-better objec-
tive measures of institutional density (e.g., Peterson et al., 2000) and direct
measures of the organizational networks and processes of decision making
that are at the heart of making institutions collectively efficacious.
