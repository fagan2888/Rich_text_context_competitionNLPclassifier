Background. Few studies have evaluated the potential influence of Helicobacter pylori on biomarkers for diabetes.
Methods. We conducted cross-sectional analyses using data from 7417 participants in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (aged $18 years) and 6072 participants in NHANES 1999­2000
(aged $3 years) to assess the association between H. pylori and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
Results. There was no association between H. pylori and history of self-reported diabetes. Helicobacter pylori
seropositivity, especially H. pylori cagA positivity, was positively associated (P , .01, NHANES III; P 5 .02,
NHANES 1999­2000) with HbA1c levels after excluding individuals with history of diabetes and controlling for
potential confounders. There was also a synergistic interaction between H. pylori and higher body mass index (BMI),
such that increased levels of HbA1c associated with having both H. pylori and higher BMI were greater than the sum
of their individual effects (P for interaction , .01). This interaction was observed consistently in both NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2000 and for H. pylori cagA positivity in NHANES III.
Conclusions. The findings indicate a role of H. pylori in impaired glucose tolerance in adults that may be
potentiated by higher BMI level.
Diabetes mellitus, a chronic disease marked by high
levels of sugar in the blood, is common and increasing
around the world [1]. Although major risk factors for
type 2 diabetes, such as obesity, have been identified,
research that assesses susceptibility to diabetes risk due
to obesity is needed.
The mammalian stomach produces leptin and ghre-
lin, 2 hormones involved in energy homeostasis [2, 3]
and whose interactions affect obesity, insulin sensi-
tivity, and glucose homeostasis [4, 5]. Helicobacter
pylori are gram-negative bacteria that colonize the
human stomach; increasing evidence indicates that
H. pylori is involved in the regulation of these 2 hor-
mones [6]. Helicobacter pylori is an ancient organism
that is highly prevalent in developing countries but is
falling in incidence in developed countries [7, 8]. This
change in the microecology of human populations
due to the disappearance of H. pylori may have met-
abolic consequences both early and late in life and, in
particular, could affect risk of obesity and diabetes
by influencing the production of gastric leptin and
ghrelin [6].
The literature on the relationship between H. pylori
colonization and diabetes is inconsistent [9­15]. To
better understand the pathophysiologic mechanisms by
which H. pylori plays a role in diabetes etiology, studies
of diabetes biomarkers are needed. Glycated hemoglobin
(HbA1c) results from the nonenzymatic glycosylation of
hemoglobin, reflecting integrated blood glucose levels
during the preceding 3­4 months [16­18]; as such,
fasting is not necessary for its measurement. HbA1c
levels are predictive of both prevalent and incident
diabetes and are useful in diagnosing prediabetes and
diabetes [16­18]. Prior studies on the association
between H. pylori and HbA1c have been limited [19].

H. pylori and HbA1c d JID 2012:205 (15 April) d 1195
Examination Survey (NHANES) III (aged $18 years) and 6072
participants in NHANES 1999­2000 (aged $3 years), we as-
sessed the association between H. pylori and levels of HbA1c as
well as self-reported diabetes status.
METHODS
Study Population
The study population included participants in NHANES III
and NHANES 1999­2000 from whom data on H. pylori status
were obtained. NHANES is a program of studies designed
to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children
in the United States, using a stratified, multistage probability
design to select a representative sample of the civilian, non-
institutionalized US population [20]. NHANES III, the seventh
health examination survey performed in the United States
since 1960 [20], was conducted October 1988­October 1994
in 2 phases, each comprising a national probability sample.
In NHANES III, 39 695 persons were studied; of those, 10 120
were adults sampled during the first phase from 18 October
1988 to 24 October 1991. Beginning in 1999, NHANES be-
came a continuous annual survey of 5000 people rather than
a periodic survey [21]. NHANES 1999­2000 is the first phase
of NHANES IV. The survey protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. All participants gave written informed con-
sent. NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000 are the only
releases of this cross-sectional national survey that include
laboratory data on H. pylori status. The present study included
7417 participants in NHANES III and 6072 participants in
NHANES 1999­2000 with available data on H. pylori, HbA1c,
and sociodemographic and lifestyle variables.
Helicobacter pylori Status
In NHANES III phase 1, examinees aged $18 years were tested
for H. pylori immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in 1996 using
the H. pylori IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
(Wampole Laboratories) and CagA IgG ELISA developed and
standardized at Vanderbilt University, as described previously
[22]. On the basis of H. pylori and cagA results, patients were
classified into 3 groups: H. pylori­positive and cagA-positive;
H. pylori­positive and cagA-negative; and H. pylori­negative and
cagA-negative, as described previously [23, 24]. The H. pylori­
negative cagA-positive group included all persons with a positive
CagA assay regardless of the results of the H. pylori assay,
based on the utility of the CagA antigen to detect true-positive
responses in culture-positive persons in the face of negative or
equivocal values in the H. pylori serologic assay [25]. By defi-
nition, all persons in the H. pylori­negative group had negative
CagA assays.
Among all 8969 participants aged $3 years enrolled in
NHANES 1999­2000 [21], H. pylori status was determined
using the Wampole ELISA. For each specimen, an immune
status ratio (ISR) was calculated by dividing the specimen
optical density by the mean optical density of the cutoff
controls. Specimens were considered negative if the ISR
was 0­0.90 and positive if ISR was .0.90, as in prior studies
[26, 27].
Diabetes Status and HbA1c Measurement
Diabetes was defined by either self-report of a physician di-
agnosis or insulin use. HbA1c measurements were performed
by the Diabetes Diagnostic Laboratory at the University of
Missouri­Columbia using the Diamat Analyzer System (Bio-
Rad Laboratories) for NHANES III and CLC330/CLC 385
analyzer (Primus) for NHANES 1999­2000. Both assays were
standardized to the reference method that was used for the
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial [28].
Statistical Methods
Descriptive analyses were first conducted to compare the
distributions of H. pylori status and means of HbA1c by so-
ciodemographic and lifestyle variables. Multiple linear re-
gression models were conducted to evaluate the relationship
between H. pylori status and HbA1c levels. We computed
adjusted least squares means of HbA1c by H. pylori status in the
overall population. We also conducted analyses excluding
cases of diabetes and insulin users to evaluate the associations
in individuals whose HbA1c levels were not affected by
treatments of diabetes, such as insulin use. Potential con-
founders including age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass
index (BMI), smoking status, and educational attainment
were adjusted in the models. Analyses were conducted to
evaluate HbA1c levels by H. pylori positive and negative status
in both NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000. Because cagA
status was available only in NHANES III, analyses that as-
sessed HbA1c levels by joint status of H. pylori and cagA
(H. pylori­positive and cagA-positive; H. pylori­positive and
cagA-negative; and H. pylori­negative) were performed only in
NHANES III. In addition, we evaluated whether the association
between H. pylori and HbA1c differed by BMI by including
a cross-product term between H. pylori and BMI expressed as
a continuous variable. The P value of the coefficient for the cross-
product term was used to consider the significance of the in-
teraction. We also conducted stratified analyses using the stan-
dard definition for overweight (BMI $25) vs normal (BMI ,25).
To evaluate the association between H. pylori status and di-
abetes, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) for diabetes in relation to
H. pylori using unconditional logistic regression, controlling
for the same potential variables indicated above. Similar
analyses for testing interaction by BMI and stratified BMI
level also were conducted. To evaluate the association between
H. pylori and diabetes using a more strict definition of di-
abetes, sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the
1196 d JID 2012:205 (15 April) d Chen & Blaser
association between H. pylori status and current use of insulin
due to diabetes.
All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.1.4 proc survey
procedures (SAS Institute), accounting for the complex
sampling design in NHANES. Sampling errors were estimated
using the primary sampling units and strata provided in the
data set. Sampling weights were used to adjust for nonresponse
bias and the oversampling in NHANES.
RESULTS
In NHANES III, men had higher levels of HbA1c compared
with women (Table 1). As expected, there was a positive as-
sociation between age and HbA1c and between BMI and
HbA1c in both NHANES study populations. Participants with
higher educational attainment or who were past smokers had
significantly lower HbA1c levels. There also were associations
with race/ethnicity such that non-Hispanic blacks and Mexi-
can Americans had a higher level of HbA1c compared with
non-Hispanic whites (Table 1). Older participants, those who
had lower educational attainment, non-Hispanic black and
Mexican American participants, and those with a higher BMI
were more likely to have been colonized by H. pylori com-
pared with their counterparts. In total, these data confirm
expected associations of demographic and lifestyle factors
with HbA1c and H. pylori status and suggest a relationship
between H. pylori and BMI.
Association Between H. pylori and HbA1c
In NHANES 1999­2000, among the overall population, those
who were H. pylori­positive had higher mean HbA1c levels
(P 5 .02) (Table 2), a finding that persisted when subjects
who had known diabetes or were insulin users were excluded
(P 5 .02). The positive association was more apparent among
those aged $18 years (P 5 .01). In contrast, among those
aged # 18 years, there was no association between H. pylori
and HbA1c levels. There was a significant interaction between
H. pylori and age, such that the increased levels of HbA1c as-
sociated with H. pylori positivity was greater in those who were
aged .18 years (P for interaction ,.01). When the population
of adults was stratified on the basis of BMI (,25 and $25),
there was a positive association between H. pylori positivity

and HbA1c levels only among those with higher BMI. There
was a significant interaction between H. pylori and BMI, such
that the increased levels of HbA1c associated with H. pylori
positivity were greater in those with higher BMI (P for in-
teraction ,.01)
In NHANES III, HbA1c levels were higher in participants
who had been colonized with H. pylori only among those
who did not have diabetes (P , .01) (Table 2). Consistent
with NHANES 1999­2000, H. pylori positivity was significantly
associated with higher mean levels of HbA1c among those
with no history of diabetes who had a higher BMI (P , .01),
but in addition, elevated HbA1c was observed in persons
with BMI ,25. The interaction between H. pylori and BMI
also was significant, suggesting a synergistic effect between
H. pylori positivity and higher BMI in relation to HbA1c. The
magnitude of the positive associations between H. pylori
and HbA1c levels in NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000
appears to be comparable when cases of diabetes and current
insulin use were excluded.
Association Between H. pylori cagA and HbA1c
Because H. pylori cagA status also was ascertained in NHANES
III, we could determine whether persons who had cagA-positive
or cagA-negative strains had differences in HbA1c (Table 3).
These data showed a progressive increase in HbA1c compar-
ing H. pylori­negative, H. pylori­positive/cagA-negative, and
H. pylori­positive/cagA-positive subjects in the overall study
population (P 5 .02), especially after those with diabetes or

who were insulin users were excluded (P , .01) (Table 3). In
stratified analyses by BMI, H. pylori cagA positivity was pos-
itively related to HbA1c levels in both participants with
a lower BMI and participants with a higher BMI after ex-
cluding those with history of diabetes. The joint status of
higher BMI and H. pylori cagA positivity (but not cagA neg-
ativity) was associated with increased HbA1c levels in relation
to the sum of their individual effects (P for interaction , .01).
Association Between H. pylori and Diabetes
We also estimated ORs for diabetes in relation to H. pylori
status in both NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000 (Table 4).
In NHANES 1999­2000, there was an overall positive associa-
tion between H. pylori and prevalence of diabetes (OR, 1.30;
95% confidence interval [CI], .94­1.80), and the association
was significant among participants with BMI .25 (OR, 1.43;
95% CI, 1.00­2.03). The data did not indicate that the asso-
ciation between H. pylori and diabetes differs by levels of BMI
(P for interaction 5 .21).
In NHANES III, there was no association between H. pylori
and diabetes overall nor was there an association in partic-
ipants stratified by BMI (Table 4). We also further assessed
whether there was an association between cagA positivity and
diabetes. The data also indicate that there was no association
between cagA positivity and diabetes overall and in stratified
analyses by BMI.
In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the association between
H. pylori and current use of insulin due to diabetes. There was no
significant association between H. pylori or H. pylori cagA
positivity in the overall populations or within BMI strata, al-
though the sample size was limited for this analysis (data not
shown).
DISCUSSION
In this large, cross-sectional study, we found a positive associ-
ation between H. pylori status and HbA1c levels among adult
participants free of diabetes. The increased levels of HbA1c as-
sociated with H. pylori were greater among those with higher
BMI. These associations were consistent in the independent
populations from the 2 NHANES, completed about 10 years
apart. In addition, H. pylori cagA positivity was related to high
levels of HbA1c, and there was an interaction between H. pylori
cagA positivity and higher levels of BMI in HbA1c. However,
the data did not indicate that there was an association between
H. pylori and self-report of diabetes.
Previous studies on the association between H. pylori and
diabetes have had mixed results [9­14], likely due to incon-
sistencies in the methods used to define H. pylori positivity and
diabetes status, the limited sample sizes, and adjustments for
potential confounders [9]. In particular, the accuracy of self-
reported data on medical history depends on the subjects'
knowledge and understanding of the relevant information,
their ability to recall, and their willingness to report it [29],
which also may change over time. In prior studies, the sensi-
tivity of self-reported diabetes has ranged from 66.7% to 85.2%
[29­32], which may lead to nondifferential misclassification
and a bias toward the null. In addition, the prevalence of

H. pylori and HbA1c d JID 2012:205 (15 April) d 1199
H. pylori decreased substantially from NHANES III to NHANES
1999­2000, probably due to a cohort effect [27]. These issues
may explain our inconsistent findings on the association be-
tween H. pylori and diabetes in the 2 NHANES populations.
Alternatively, secular aspects of the distributional change of
risk factors for diabetes that may interact with H. pylori may
render the population more or less susceptible to H. pylori
effects at different points in time. It has been estimated that
the prevalence of obesity increased substantially from NHANES
III to NHANES 1999­2000 [33, 34]. Future studies with accurate
information on diagnosis of diabetes are needed to evaluate the
association between H. pylori and diabetes.
We found a positive association between H. pylori status and
HbA1c levels, a valid and reliable biomarker for long-term
blood glucose level [16­18]. The results from the 2 NHANES
populations were consistent, suggesting validity of the find-
ings. Although the present study is a cross-sectional study,
reverse causation is not likely. Helicobacter pylori is acquired
almost exclusively in childhood [8], and there is no clear
mechanism for how glucose intolerance present only after the
age of 18 would increase risk of H. pylori colonization. It also is
unlikely that H. pylori positivity and high levels of HbA1c
levels share a mutual antecedent cause because there is no
diathesis to both acquire H. pylori and to cause glucose in-
tolerance. The most plausible hypothesis is that H. pylori di-
rectly or indirectly increases levels of HbA1c in adulthood,
particularly in obese individuals. We now know that H. pylori
plays a role in the regulation of leptin and ghrelin [6, 35­38],
which are central to energy homeostasis and metabolism [4, 5].
Accumulating evidence also indicates that the metabolic
syndrome is an inflammatory disorder. Helicobacter pylori
induces gastric inflammation; the H. pylori­positive stomach
and the H. pylori­negative stomach are markedly different in
terms of T-cell and B-cell populations and proinflammatory
cytokines [39­41]dthese have a local effect, but there is in-
creasing evidence for global effects [42].
Helicobacter pylori strains possessing the cag genomic island
express a type 4 secretion system that injects the CagA protein
into human epithelial cells [43]. Antibody responses to the
CagA protein permit detection of such cag-positive strains
[22], which are more interactive with host cells than cag-
negative strains [43, 44] and are associated with higher risk for
gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease and lower risk of esopha-
geal reflux and sequelae and asthma [24, 27, 45­49]. Our findings
based on the NHANES III study population show a gradient in
A1c levels from H. pylori­negative, to H. pylori­positive and
cagA-negative to H. pylori­positive and cagA-positive. This con-
sistency, predicted by the biological differences between the
3 states of gastric microecology [43, 44], provides evidence
that the relationship is not due to artifacts.
Although the literature indicates that there is no clear re-
lationship between H. pylori and obesity [23], our study pro-
vides further evidence that H. pylori affects host metabolic status.
The increasing trend in diabetes and obesity can not be ex-
plained by the decreasing prevalence of H. pylori because di-
abetes and obesity are multifactorial disorders that involve
environmental, lifestyle, genetic, and social factors. Given that

the prevalence of H. pylori is decreasing, the proportion of
diabetes that could be attributable to H. pylori is likely to also
decrease. However, among older individuals and especially
those with a higher BMI, glucose intolerance associated with
H. pylori could remain significant. The findings add to the
evidence of a model for age-related pleiotrophy of H. pylori
or a life-course perspective in H. pylori [44]. The potential
benefits of H. pylori occur predominantly earlier in life, in-
cluding a reduced risk of asthma [24, 27], tuberculosis re-
activation [50], childhood diarrhea [51], and gastroesophageal
reflux disease [45­49]. Among older individuals, the adverse
health effects include peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer, and
perhaps increased glucose intolerance. The data from this
study are consistent with findings that H. pylori eradication in
older individuals may be beneficial.
