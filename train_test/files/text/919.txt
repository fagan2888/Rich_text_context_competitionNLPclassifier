Are Small Firms Greater Health Risks?
by Wanda W. Young, Dorothy Z. Joyce, Beatrice C. Carter,

Abstract: To test whether use ofhealth care services is a function offirm size, we analyzed a three-year
database (1988-1990) of private insurance claims, representing 28,990 firms and approximately 1.4
million subscribers in western Pennsylvania. In this database both small and large firms had higher
medically underwritten costs than mid-size firms had. Furthermore, risk-pooling alternatives that
included small companies had a lower cost per subscriber than the risk pools that included large
companies, especially companies of more than 500 contract holders. Age, sex, health status, and the
types of hospitals used for inpatient care of pooled subscribers, in combination, were found to be the
important determinants of costs. With risk adjustment based on these factors to correct for adverse
risk selection, community rating can be a feasible approach to increasing the affordability and
accessibility of health insurance to the majority of those who lack it.
Providing affordable health insurance to small businesses is critical to
reducing the number of uninsured Americans.1 Because premiums are
more costly for small firms than for large firms and because of the
insurance industry's common practice of risk selection (risk or experience
rating), health insurance has been less accessible to employees of small firms
and their dependents. By virtue of their size, small businesses do in fact pose
greater financial risks to insurers--that is, their health care costs are less
stable and thus harder to predict with sufficient accuracy for firm-specific
experience rating. Moreover, many believe that coverage for small firms is
more costly to administer than that for large firms, and that subscribers from
small firms have higher health risks and use more services than subscribers
from large companies.
Although the profitability of insuring firms by type and size is frequently
analyzed, the actual costs of health services used by individual subscribers
(as opposed to premiums and costs for the firm in aggregate) have not been
measured consistently and compared systematically across firms of different

sizes. In this study we assess whether firm size is associated with subscriber
costs; we then assess whether firm size is important in explaining differences
in the health risk status of policyholders.
Our primary hypothesis is that the underwritten cost of the medical
services used by contract holders of small firms and their dependents, on
average, is not higher than that among their counterparts in large firms.
The analysis is intended to test the implicit assumption of many insurance
carriers that health risk is a function of firm size--specifically, that subscrib-
ers from small firms are higher health risks, and therefore incur higher
medical costs, than subscribers from large companies.3 This untested as-
sumption has led some insurance companies to price health coverage
higher for small companies or to refuse to underwrite small firms at all.
Data And Methods
We assembled a longitudinal person-level file of health insurance claims
and associated demographic and benefits data for subscribers in firms of all
sizes located in western Pennsylvania. These firms were active customers of
Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania (BCWP) and Pennsylvania Blue
Shield (PBS) during all or a part of the study period (1 January 1988-31
December 1990). Subscribers in this database had similar benefits--tradi-
tional, first-dollar Blue Cross hospitalization coverage, Blue Shield "UCR-
100" professional coverage (100 percent reimbursement of the usual, cus-
tomary, or reasonable fee), and Major Medical coverage (80 percent of
charges for eligible supplementary services).4
The resulting database included more than 20.5 million records for
approximately 1.4 million covered lives (contract holders, spouses, and
dependents) per year. Databases such as this one are uncommon since few
large third-party payers continue to provide comparable health care benefit
plans (without medical underwriting, preexisting condition exclusions, and
copayments) to small and large firms.
Membership files, the primary source of eligibility and demographic
information on each subscriber, were validated first.5 Inpatient, profes-
sional, and supplementary claims for covered services then were linked for
each subscriber over time to establish episodes of care. By creating a
person-level file of claims submitted over three years, we could define the
measure of health care use for each person, firm, and risk pool as a stand-
ardized cost of all covered services per subscriber per year.
Hospital inpatient and outpatient costs were standardized using each
hospital's ratio of total costs to total charges applied to patient charges
(RCCAC methodology). No adjustments were made to professional fees or
supplementary (ancillary and drug) charges. These cost estimates were

converted to 1990 dollars using the hospital market-basket index of Data
Research Incorporated (DRI). The resulting cost per subscriber is similar to
the insurance industry term pure premium, which reflects the cost of all
insured medical services without the insurer's administrative expense or
any retention fee charged by the insurer for administrative services.
To test the hypothesis that use of health services is a function of firm size,
subscribers were aggregated into risk pools by firm size using number of
contract holders as a surrogate for firm size. A total of 490 distinct firm sizes
emerged, ranging from firms of one to 18,730. Within each, subscribers
were aggregated into ten age/sex strata, yielding a set of 4,900 data points.
All other variables (cost per subscriber, proportion of subscribers using
metropolitan teaching hospitals, average case-mix units per subscriber, and
so on) were calculated at the stratum level for each firm size.
This analytic design was sensitive to differences among subscribers at
each firm-size level while providing enough data points for multivariate
analysis. To do this analysis at the individual firm level would have been
inappropriate because of the extreme variability in the number of subscrib-
ers across firms. Similarly, an analysis at the firm-size level, without age/sex
subscriber strata, would have incorporated a disproportionate amount of
variation within the small firm sizes.
Because case-mix units per subscriber were used both as an independent
variable in explaining costs and as a dependent variable in explaining
health risk, this is one of the most important variables we constructed. We
considered this variable to be a reasonable surrogate for the health status of
each risk pool because all subscribers in a pool, including those who used no
services, contributed to the measure. A case-mix score was assigned to each
person in the database by using the Patient Management Category (PMC)
Classification and Scoring System and the diagnosis and procedure infor-
mation on inpatient claims.6
The PMC Relative Intensity Score assigned to each subscriber quantifies
the illness conditions of inpatients and the relative resource use expected
for each patient.7 Subscribers without inpatient use received a score of zero.
Combining all scores within a given pool and dividing by the number of
subscribers in that pool yielded the variable used for health risk status--
case-mix units per subscriber. Since this variable is not a measure of prior
use, we avoid much of the circularity found with other case-mix measures.
Study population. Although large firms (more than 500 contract hold-
ers) make up less than 1 percent of all firms in this database, they account
for 36 percent of the total number of contract holders (n = 598,270) and
36.3 percent of the total number of subscribers (contract holders and their
dependents, n = 1,360,636). Small firms (fifty or fewer contract holders)
account for a similar proportion of contract holders and subscribers (30.5

percent and 29,0 percent, respectively), but represent nearly 95 percent of
all firms in the database. Firms of ten or fewer contract holders account for
77-5 percent of the firms and 11.7 percent of the covered lives.
We define firm size as the number of BCWP/PBS contract holders in the
firm, not necessarily total number of employees. In addition to being a
readily available measure of firm size, it is a better indicator for the insur-
ance industry of the size of the firm being rated than is a count of full-time-
equivalent (FTE) employees. Furthermore, we did not have complete infor-
mation about whether employees could opt out of coverage, whether
premium sharing occurred, or who paid the premium, contract holder or
employer. However, during the study period BCWP and PBS covered
approximately 90 percent of the employer-based health insurance in the
area, benefit options were not a common practice in western Pennsylvania,
and businesses could enroll or disenroll at any time.
Demographics and firm size. The proportion of subscribers in each
company over age fifty-five is higher for both the largest and the smallest
firms, and lower in mid-size firms (19 percent in firms with more than a
thousand contract holders; 13.3 percent in firms with ten and fewer con-
tract holders; and 10.4 percent in firms with fifty-one to one hundred
contract holders). Statistical analysis verified a significant relationship
between the mean age of subscribers in each firm size and yearly health care
use as measured by total costs of care.
Sex was also found to correlate significantly with costs: Female subscrib-
ers incurred more costs on average ($969 per year) than males ($856 per
year). To specify and evaluate the interactive effect of age and sex on use
and costs, we constructed ten age/sex strata (five age groups by two gender
groups) within each firm size.
Results
Firm size and costs. Exhibit 1 shows the total cost of care per subscriber
per year, as well as the cost of each component of care (inpatient, out-
patient, professional, and supplementary) by firm size. These raw numbers
show that the smallest firms (defined as ten or fewer contract holders) have
higher costs, on average, than firms of other sizes have. However, the
largest firms (more than 1,000 contract holders) also have, on average,
essentially the same total unadjusted costs of care as the smallest firms. This
slightly U-shaped distribution (with higher costs for both small and large
firms) is similar to the distribution of mean subscriber age across firm sizes.
To evaluate the effect of firm size on costs per subscriber while control-
ling for other known sources of variation across strata and firm sizes, we
used multivariate regression techniques. In this way, variables (or covari-

ates) that are most predictive of use could be identified.
Significant independent variables in the model that best explained the
variation in cost per subscriber include the two sex and five age categories
and the interaction of these two variables; the proportion of hospital
admissions at metropolitan teaching hospitals compared with all other
hospitals; average case-mix units per subscriber; and the interaction of
health risk status and age.8 When combined, these variables accounted for
approximately 90 percent of the variation in the costs of health care use.
Firm size was not significant in this model Nevertheless, by incorporat-
ing firm size as a categorical variable into the model, we could evaluate the
association between firm size and costs directly, while adjusting for all
important covariates. The resulting correlation coefficient was 0.03 (p =
0.45), indicating no relationship.
The variable found to have the most significant correlation with costs
was case-mix units per subscriber. In general, costs per subscriber are higher
as age increases. Males are less costly than females, with the exception of
male children and adolescents compared with females of the same age.
Furthermore, with the exception of children age three and under, the
interaction of age and case-mix units per subscriber increases the costs per
subscriber even more. We believe that the variable related to use of metro-
politan teaching hospitals is a further adjustment for price differentials
among hospitals and reflects the capacity of various types of hospitals. This
variable was found to be directly related to the costs of care per subscriber.9
Results of additional multivariate analyses yielded consistent evidence
that risk pools comprising subscribers from small firms do not use more
services or incur more costs, on average, than risk pools of subscribers from
firms of any other size. Rather, age, sex, health risk status, and the types of
hospitals used by the pool of subscribers, in combination, were found to be

the important determinants of costs.
Firm size and health risk. Given the lack of any significant relationship
between firm size and health care costs after adjusting for age, sex, and the
health risk status of policyholders (based on our model), we then explored
the relationship between firm size and health risk status. That is, even
though subscribers of similar age, sex, and disease mix use similar services,
are subscribers of small firms sicker than subscribers of large firms, and,
therefore, do they pose greater health risks? To answer this question, we
performed additional multivariate analyses, this time using case-mix units
per subscriber as the dependent variable. Approximately 67.8 percent of
the variation in case-mix units per subscriber was explained by age, sex, the
interaction of age and sex, and the proportion of subscribers using metro-
politan teaching hospitals. We found no statistically significant relation-
ship between firm size and health risk. Using firm size as a categorical
variable yielded a model that again permitted a direct assessment of the
association of firm size and health risk status, with a resulting correlation
coefficient of 0.08 (p = 0.07).
Pooling arrangements. We next sought to understand the effect of
including firms of different sizes in community-rated risk pools. To do this,
we calculated the pure premium (costs of use alone, without administrative
expense) for various pooling arrangements. Exhibit 2 shows the average
cost per subscriber per year for selected risk pools. It should be emphasized
that these costs are not adjusted for the age, sex, or case-mix of subscribers
in each pool. That is, no risk adjustment has been applied to these costs.
Rather, they reflect the actual utilization differences occurring among this
set of small, mid-size, and large firms.
If all firms in the study population were pooled, the average cost per
subscriber per year would be $916. By contrast, the lowest-cost pooling
alternative includes firms with 1-500 contract holders ($888), while the
highest-cost risk pool includes firms that have more than 500 contract
holders ($959). Most of the pooling alternatives that include small firms

(for example, 1-50, 1-100, and 1-200) have a lower cost per subscriber
than do the risk pools that include larger companies.
Exhibit 2 illustrates the cost benefits that are possible for small businesses
if they are rated with larger firms in community-rated risk pools. This
finding confirms what many policy analysts have suggested in the past: that
small firms would pay less if they were included in community-rated risk
pools. In fact, it is the very small firms of five or fewer contract holders that
would pay much less if included with larger firms (Exhibit 3). An unex-
pected finding of this analysis, however, is that very large firms (more than
500 contract holders) also would pay less if they were included in commu-
nity-rated risk pools, while mid-size firms, on average, would pay more.
Further examination of the risk pool including firms of all sizes indicates
that for 65 percent of all firms, the firm-specific average cost per subscriber
was less than the community rate of $916 per subscriber per year. That is,
for this particular database, these firms (with their low use) would have
subsidized the other 35 percent of firms whose use exceeded the pooled
average. While only 35 percent of all firms had average costs per subscriber
per year that exceeded the community rate of $916, the amount of savings
by these "winner" firms if they had paid the community rate (rather than
the actual costs of use) far exceeds the amount the "losers" would have paid
beyond their actual use.
This analysis shows that despite the fears of large firms and other advo-
cates of experience rating, community rating is a feasible approach to
increasing the affordability of health insurance among the firms in this
database. Actual use and cost differences among firms of different sizes are
small, and increasing the size of risk pools, regardless of the size of the firms
included, will improve the stability and thus the predictability of rates.
Policy Implications
Contract holders who work for small firms, and their dependents, neither
pose greater health risk nor incur more health care costs than do the

policyholders associated with firms of other sizes, all other factors being
equal10 Our results refute the assumptions of some insurers that small-firm
policyholders are sicker and that they use more medical services and incur
more costs than large-firm subscribers.
What is most important in explaining variation in costs across firm sizes
is the health risk status of the population of policyholders in a particular risk
pool In our database, however, small-firm subscribers, on average, were not
sicker than large-firm subscribers, given their age and sex profile. Neverthe-
less, insurers probably will continue to think of small firms as "too risky,"
primarily because a single, unpredictable, costly illness could have a greater
impact on small firms' cost experience and actuarial rating than is the case
in larger firms. This situation, however, is attributable to the size of the risk
pool, rather than the size of the firm in the risk pool.
Without age/sex and case-mix adjustment, both small and large firms in
our study population had higher costs per subscriber per year than mid-size
firms had. Furthermore, risk pools that included smaller companies had a
lower cost per subscriber than did the risk pools that included larger
companies, especially firms with more than 500 contract holders. These
findings suggest that some form of risk pooling is a feasible approach to
correcting insurance market inequities in health care if they are imple-
mented hand-in-hand with a risk adjustment methodology.
Many analysts agree that some form of community rating should be used
to mitigate the effects of a single costly illness on an individual firm's
premium. Alternatives could be designed to spread risk and reduce variabil-
ity in costs for any one firm in a risk pool. Community rating without
medical underwriting is especially important to bring health care coverage
within the financial reach of small firms. The unanswered question is how
to structure risk pools to reduce variability in costs and stabilize trends.
Debate in this country has focused on whether community rating should
be mandatory or voluntary, publicly financed or subsidized, or some combi-
nation of these options. Should firms of all sizes be combined, or should
some firms be allowed to form their own risk pools and have separate and
different premiums? What about persons who purchase insurance directly
from private carriers, or for whom insurance is publicly provided?
Although the data used for this study were comprehensive, representing
nearly all of the insured firms with full-service benefits in one geographic
region, we could not address many of the complexities of community rating
and risk adjustment, such as the more current scenarios of multiple benefit
plans within each firm, selective contracting, and multiple payer involve-
ment. Furthermore, we did not address the question of including currently
uninsured persons or other publicly financed insured persons such as
Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. These persons, as well as those who

purchase insurance directly from private insurers, are expected to have
much different patterns of health care use. While the concept of commu-
nity rating or risk pooling would be the same, the level of costs and the risk
adjustment factors may be much different for other populations.
With community rating, by virtue of chance or geographic location, or
by design, some health plans inevitably will include sicker or healthier
enrollees than their competitors. Unless each risk pool can approximate the
characteristics of the entire community, application of a risk adjustment
methodology will be necessary to maintain a reasonably competitive
private health insurance market. Our analyses represent a framework for
the development and validation of such a retrospective risk adjuster.
More research is needed, however, to understand how such a risk adjust-
ment mechanism, once designed and tested, would actually work in the
private sector with multiple payers. Given the recent political rejection of
a federally managed solution to health care reform, new thinking is needed
to create a workable mix of public regulatory and private-sector initiatives
that can achieve affordable health care. We believe that our research points
toward the conclusion that, with community leadership--by insurance
companies, the corporate community, and others--effective health care
can be delivered to all citizens and financed at affordable prices.

There was no point-of-service option, and enrollment in preferred provider organiza-
tions and HMOs was negligible (less than 5 percent of the population). Firms that had
comprehensive benefit plans with subscriber copayments were excluded from the study
because of the lack of comparable utilization data for these subscribers.
5. To validate the accuracy of data in BCWP's current membership files and to assess any
systematic biases in reporting changes in dependent status (for example, births/deaths),
we conducted a separate telephone survey of a randomly selected sample of BCWP
contract holders. Based on a 95.5 percent response rate, we found that BCWP's
computerized membership files are an accurate reflection of active subscribers enrolled.
Changes in subscriber status identified by the survey reflect a 1.5 percent error rate.

and Validation," Health Services Research (September 1994): 367-390.
7. The relative weights associated with the PMCs are based on expected services, as
specified by physicians, for a given clinical condition(s). Because this measure is derived
from the clinical conditions coded on claims forms, it is administratively feasible to
implement. Furthermore, because this score is based on expected services, as opposed
to actual service use or average charges billed for services used, it incorporates incentives
for efficient practice patterns rather than relying on extant practices. Thus, this variable
is not a measure of prior use; rather, it reflects the intensity of the disease mix of a
population and what that disease mix should cost, given efficient and effective practice.
Use of this measure moves us away from the common practice of evaluating costs with
measures derived based on current use and/or actual historical cost patterns.

Center for Health Services Research, Springwood Conference Center, 1000 Indiana

9. Others have speculated that the proportion of subscribers using metropolitan teaching
hospitals is an endogenous variable and thus should not be included in this model--that
is, the expectation is that the proportion who use teaching hospitals depends on the
case-mix of the subscriber pool. This assumes that people go to metropolitan teaching
hospitals primarily for the treatment of complex illnesses and that severe cases will tend
to be treated at tertiary care centers. However, this is not true at the level of analysis
used in this study--age/sex strata within firm sizes. In fact, there is no correlation
between average case-mix units per subscriber and the proportion of subscribers treated
at metropolitan teaching facilities. Rather, the proportion of subscribers who use
advanced teaching facilities may reflect an additional price differential between teach-
ing and nonteaching facilities. Or, this variable may reflect the capacity of the local
hospital industry, a variable that is the most important indicator of need according to
John E. Wennberg in a letter to the editor of Health Affairs (Spring II 1994): 302.
10. The statistical models of average cost and average case-mix units per subscriber were
estimated at the level of age/sex strata within firm sizes. While this unit of analysis is
appropriate and may be adequate to use for risk adjustment under current employer-
based insurance programs, more analysis is necessary to assess whether similar relation-
ships exist at the subscriber level and for the family unit, which are more likely units
of enrollment under many managed care reform scenarios. See J.P. Newhouse, "Patients
At Risk: Health Reform and Risk Adjustment," Health Care Financing Review (Spring
