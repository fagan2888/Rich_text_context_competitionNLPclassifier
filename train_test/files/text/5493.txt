Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of immunosuppressive anticancer therapy on titre levels of
anti-hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) in hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and
anti-HBs positive patients with haematological malignancies or solid tumours.
Methods: This retrospective study reviewed the medical records of patients with haematological
malignancies or solid tumours. Pretreatment HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive patients were
included in the analysis. Anti-hepatitis B core antibody status was used to evaluate vaccinated
patients and those with resolved HBV infections.
Results: The medical records of 237 patients were reviewed retrospectively. The median anti-HBs
titre decreased significantly after anticancer therapy compared with the pretreatment median anti-
HBs titre in all patients (71 mIU/ml versus 57 mIU/ml). Anti-HBs titre decreased significantly in
patients with haematological malignancies (70 mIU/m versus 37 mIU/ml) and in patients adminis-
tered rituximab-based chemotherapy (67 mIU/ml versus 33 mIU/ml) following chemotherapy,
whereas there was no significant change in patients with solid tumours. After chemotherapy,
patients with low pretreatment anti-HBs titres (<100 mIU/ml) were more likely to become
seronegative (<10 mIU/ml).

Introduction
Infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is
a major public health concern, with around
two billion people worldwide having been
exposed to the virus.1 Although vaccination
is effective, approximately 350 million
people have chronic HBV infection, and
more than one million patients are estimated
to die every year as a result of cirrhosis and/
or hepatocellular carcinoma caused by
HBV.1,2 As in other developing countries,
HBV is a serious health problem in Turkey,
where the prevalence of hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity is 4.2­
8.2%.3,4
Hepatitis commonly affects cancer
patients who receive immunosuppressive
anticancer agents for both haematological
malignancies and solid tumours and
reactivation of the HBV is a serious compli-
cation.5­7 Reactivation of HBV is character-
ized by elevated transaminases, clinical
hepatitis and raised levels of serum HBV
DNA.5 HBsAg positive carriers have a
particularly high risk of reactivation of the
virus.5,6 Among HBV carriers, the incidence
of reactivation is 20­70% and the associated
mortality rate is 5­40% in patients receiving
anticancer therapy.8 The rate of reactivation
is lower in patients with solid tumours
receiving standard cytotoxic chemotherapy
than it is in patients with haematological
malignancies;9 and those with non-
Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) that are trea-
ted with rituximab-based schedules have an
especially high risk.10 Over the past decade,
studies have demonstrated that patients who
are HBsAg negative, hepatitis B core anti-
body (anti-HBc) positive with or without
hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs),
which indicates a resolved infection, may
develop HBV reactivation following
immunosuppressive anticancer therapy,
and that their reactivation risk is between
2.3% and 23.8%.11­17 HBV reactivation can
result in anicteric hepatitis leading to severe
hepatic failure and death, even with the
use of effective prophylactic antiviral
therapy.5,11
The potential usefulness of performing
anti-HBs screening prior to a patient
undergoing anticancer therapy is unclear
due to insufficient evidence.9,18 The present
study investigated the effects of anticancer
therapy on the levels of anti-HBs in HBsAg
negative and anti-HBs positive patients
with haematological malignancies or solid
tumours. In addition, it investigated
whether there was a chemotherapy-induced
change in the anti-HBs titres of vaccinated
patients and in patients who had had previ-
ous exposure to HBV.
Patients and methods
Patient population
This retrospective study reviewed the med-
ical records of consecutive adult patients
with haematological malignancies or solid
tumours who received immunosuppressive
anticancer therapy at the Department of
628 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
Medical Oncology and the Department
of Haematology, School of Medicine,
Ondokuz Mayis University, Samsun,
Turkey between January 2005 and
December 2014. Information on each
patient's age, sex, type of cancer and chemo-
therapy regimen, and HBV serum markers,
including HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc,
was obtained from their medical records.
The patients that tested negative for HBsAg
and positive for anti-HBs secondary to
vaccination or HBV infection prior to the
initiation of the chemotherapy were evalu-
ated for the study. Anti-HBc positive
patients were defined as those with resolved
HBV infection and anti-HBc negative
patients were defined as vaccinated
patients.9 Those patients who received !3
courses of chemotherapy and those who had
HBsAg and anti-HBs measurements after
the chemotherapy were enrolled in the
study. Patients <15 years of age, those
who had undergone an allogeneic trans-
plantation, and those with severe renal and
liver insufficiency or hepatocellular carcin-
oma were excluded from the study. The
study was approved by the Ondokuz Mayis
University Clinical Research Ethics
Committee (no. OMU KAEK 2014/898).
As this was a retrospective study that
analysed data from the medical records,
there was no need for informed patient
consent.
Serum HBV marker data collection
Hepatitis B markers were measured from
serum samples using an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the
results were obtained from the medical
records. All analyses were performed using
a cobasÕ e 601 analyser (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany) following the manu-
facturer's instructions. The minimum
detectable concentrations were 2.0 IU/l for
anti-HBs, 0.8 PEI U/mI for anti-HBc and
0.1 IU/l for HBsAg. Intra- and interassay
coefficients of variation for all ELISAs
were <8% and <12%, respectively.
Post-treatment changes in anti-HBs titres
and a return to negative titres were evalu-
ated in the different patient subgroups (i.e.
those with haematological malignancies,
solid tumours, and those that had received
rituximab-based therapy). As the upper
limit for anti-HBs titres was 100 mIU/ml in
the laboratory that undertook the analyses,
this was accepted as the cut-off level for the
pretreatment value when analysing the post-
treatment seronegativity rates in two sub-
groups based on this cut-off level. A post-
treatment titre of anti-HBs of !10 mIU/ml
was defined as positive and a titre of
<10 mIU/ml was defined as negative.
The anti-HBc status of the subgroups was
also evaluated with the cut-off level
of 1 IU/ml being defined as positive
and > 1 IU/ml being defined as negative.
The HBsAg status was also evaluated with
the cut-off level of <1 IU/ml being defined as
negative and !1 IU/ml being defined as
positive.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. The Shapiro­Wilk test was used
to analyse the variables that were normally
distributed. Variables that were not nor-
mally distributed were analysed using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann­
Whitney U-test. Fisher's exact test was
used for the evaluation of the categorical
variables. The results are presented as the
median (min­max) and n of patients (%). A
P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
This retrospective study examined the med-
ical records of 3740 consecutive adult
Yilmaz et al. 629
patients with haematological malignancies
or solid tumours who received immunosup-
pressive anticancer therapy. Of these 3740
patients, 237 patients met the criteria for
inclusion. A total of 122 (51.5%) were male
and 115 (48.5%) were female. The median
age of the patients was 54 years (range 15­86
years). The median interval between the
pretreatment and post-treatment measure-
ments of the anti-HBs titre was 295 days
(range 38­1715 days). The most common
haematological malignancies were acute leu-
kaemia and lymphoma, and the most
common solid tumours were colorectal,
breast, lung and gynaecological tumours.
The demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patients are presented in Table 1.
When all patients were analysed, the
post-treatment median anti-HBs titres
decreased significantly compared with the
pretreatment values (P < 0.001) (Table 2). In
the subgroup analysis, the post-treatment
median anti-HBs titres decreased signifi-
cantly in those with haematological malig-
nancies (P < 0.001), but not in those with
solid tumours. Furthermore, the median
anti-HBs titres decreased significantly after
rituximab-based therapy (P ¼ 0.006). As the
upper limit for anti-HBs titres was 100 mIU/
ml in the laboratory that undertook the
analyses, this was accepted as the cut-off
level. After chemotherapy, 34.6% (45 of
130) of patients who had a pretreatment
anti-HBs titre of <100 mIU/ml had a value
of <10 mIU/ml (i.e. seronegative). In con-
trast, only 7.5% (eight of 107) of those who
had a pretreatment anti-HBs titre of
!100 mIU/ml had a post-treatment value
of <10 mIU/ml. The difference between the
two groups was statistically significant
(P < 0.001). There was also a significant
difference within the haematological malig-
nancies, solid tumours, and rituximab-based
therapy subgroups (P < 0.05 for all
comparisons).
The anti-HBc total antibodies were mea-
sured in 125 of the 237 patients (52.7%)
(Table 2). Among these patients, 51 were
anti-HBc positive and 74 were anti-HBc
negative. There was a significant decrease
in the anti-HBs titres in both the anti-HBc
positive and negative groups after treatment
(P < 0.05 for both comparisons). Moreover,
the decrease of the anti-HBs was measured
for each individual patient and the median
values of the decrease in the anti-HBc
positive and negative groups were compared
(13 versus 0 mIU/ml, respectively;
P ¼ 0.044). In the haematological malig-
nancy group, there was only a significant
decrease in the median anti-HBs titres in the
anti-HBc positive patients (P < 0.001).
The rate of becoming seronegative after
chemotherapy in the anti-HBc positive
and negative groups was significantly
higher in patients with an anti-HBs titre of
<100 mIU/ml than in those with an anti-

comparisons). The results of the subgroup
analysis of the anti-HBc positive and nega-
tive patients are shown in Table 2.
The characteristics of 53 patients who
became anti-HBs negative are summarized
in Table 3. Thirty-six of these patients had
haematological malignancies and 17 had
solid tumours. Among the haematological
malignancies, there were 22 patients with
acute leukaemia and eight with lymphoma.
The most common solid tumours were
gynaecological and breast cancers.
Only three patients with haematological
malignancies developed treatment-related
HBV reactivation and their details are
listed in Table 4. In one of the patients, the
HBV was reactivated after undergoing flu-
darabine plus cyclophosphamide treatment.
The virus was deactivated following treat-
ment with lamivudine, and the patient is still
alive. A second patient remained in remis-
sion regarding her malignant disease, but
subsequently died due to fulminant hepatitis
despite the administration of antiviral ther-
apy. The third patient had received vincris-
tine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone
therapy for multiple myeloma, but when
this progressed, the patient was switched to
bortezomib and then lenalidomide. Upon
initiation of the lenalidomide therapy, HBV
reactivation occurred, and the lamivudine
therapy was continued for another 2 years.
Tenofovir was added to the therapy when
the patient developed resistance to lamivu-
dine. However, the patient ultimately died
due to primary disease progression.
Discussion
The results of the present study suggest that
a low pretreatment level of anti-HBs is a risk
factor for becoming negative for anti-HBs,
particularly in patients with haematological
malignancies who have undergone immuno-
suppressive anticancer therapy. This could
contribute to HBV reactivation. HBV

reactivation is defined as an increase in the
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level at
least three-fold higher than the baseline
value or any ALT level > 100 IU/l and a
ten-fold increase of baseline HBV DNA or
reappearance of detectable HBV DNA.5,9
HBV reactivation related to immunosup-
pressive anticancer therapy is a well-docu-
mented and common complication,
especially among HBsAg positive carriers.5,6
Other conditions, such as occult or resolved
HBV infections, can also result in reactiva-
tion.9,11­13 Lymphomas, male gender,
younger age, hepatitis B envelope antigen
seropositivity, and a high viral load are also
known risk factors for HBV reactivation
after immunosuppressive anticancer
therapy.5,9,11
Although the mechanism behind HBV
reactivation remains unclear, several pos-
sible mechanisms have been proposed. For
example, the administration of immunosup-
pressive chemotherapy affects the balance
between the host's immune system and viral
replication, thus suppressing normal
immunological responses and affecting cel-
lular and humoral immune responses.19­21
Moreover, the function of T lymphocytes
may also be suppressed and a deficient
immune response to viral antigens may
lead to reactivation.19 Likewise, immuno-
suppressive chemotherapy, particularly
rituximab-based chemotherapy, may sup-
press antibody-producing B lymphocytes,
thereby resulting in a decrease in the pro-
duction of immunoglobulins and antibodies
against HBV.19,21 Another possible mech-
anism of HBV reactivation is the withdrawal
of cytotoxic therapy.5,19 This leads to
enhanced viral replication that can then
induce a rebound immune response (hyper-
immune response), which leads to the
destruction of hepatocytes.13,19
There are a limited number of studies on
the anti-HBs status of patients with resolved
HBV infections who received immunosup-
pressive anticancer therapy.11,16,22­24 Of
those studies that do exist, almost all have
focused on haematological malignancies,
particularly NHL, in patients who received
rituximab-based therapy.11,16,22 HBV reacti-
vation occurred in five (23.8%) of 21 NHL
patients who received rituximab plus cyclo-
phosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and
prednisolone (R-CHOP), and the anti-HBs
were negative before treatment in these five
patients with HBV reactivation.11 In this
study, anti-HBs titres were not considered
quantitatively.11 Therefore, the absence of
anti-HBs has been identified as a risk factor
for HBV reactivation, in addition to the use
of rituximab.
A previous study suggested that anti-HBs
titres significantly decreased after rituximab-
based therapy in B-cell lymphoma
patients.22 The authors reported that anti-
HBs titres were more likely to decline
(<10 mIU/ml) in patients with pretreatment
anti-HBs titres of <100 mIU/ml.22 In their
study, eight of 19 patients with pretreatment
anti-HBs titres of <100 mIU/ml became
negative for anti-HBs titres, and HBV
reactivation developed in only one of these
patients.22 In contrast, none of the 10
patients with pretreatment anti-HBs
titres > 100 mIU/ml became negative for
anti-HBs after rituximab-based therapy.22
The researchers concluded that a low pre-
treatment level of anti-HBs was an inde-
pendent risk factor for the loss of anti-HBs
and HBV reactivation in patients with
resolved HBV infection receiving rituxi-
mab-based therapy.22
The impact of chemotherapy on anti-HBs
titres was studied in 75 patients with
resolved HBV infections who had haemato-
logical malignancies.23 The study reported
that the anti-HBs titres significantly
decreased after chemotherapy, especially in
patients with acute leukaemia, male
patients, and patients receiving intensive
chemotherapy.23 The findings of a prospect-
ive study conducted on patients with
resolved HBV infections undergoing
634 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
rituximab-based therapy, suggested that the
rate of HBV reactivation was significantly
higher in anti-HBs negative patients when
compared with anti-HBs positive patients.16
Another study reported that although there
was an overall decrease in anti-HBs titres,
none of the titres of the 43 patients with
haematological malignancies who had
resolved HBV infection became negative.24
Consistent with these reports, the present
study found that the anti-HBs titres of all
the patients were significantly decreased
after the therapy compared with before the
therapy (a median 57 versus 71 mIU/ml,
respectively; P < 0.001). The seronegativity
rate of the anti-HBs titres post-treatment
was significantly higher in the patients with
pretreatment titres of <100 mIU/ml than in
those with pretreatment titres of !100 mIU/
ml (P < 0.001). The subgroup analysis of the
patients revealed that the increase in post-
treatment anti-HBs seronegativity was
greatest in the group with haematological
malignancies. In contrast, it has been
reported that HBV reactivation may occur
in patients that are positive for anti-
HBs.25,26 In a case report, a patient who
had received R-CHOP presented with high
titre levels that were positive for anti-HBs at
the time of a fatal reactivation of HBV.25
Additionally, in a prospective study con-
ducted on patients who had received
immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy,
one patient out of eight that had developed
a reactivation of HBV was positive for anti-
HBs at the time of the reactivation of the
virus.26 According to both reports,25,26 these
issues were associated with mutations in the
HBsAg coding region (escape mutation).
Various studies have reported that the
risk of HBV reactivation is increased in
HBsAg positive patients undergoing cyto-
toxic chemotherapy for solid tumours.5,27­29
Other studies have reported that the prophy-
lactic use of antiviral agents prior to chemo-
therapy in these patients may reduce levels
of reactivation-related morbidity and
mortality.30­32 The clinical data regarding
resolved HBV infection rates are insufficient.
In a French study that included both haem-
atological malignancies and solid tumours,
HBV reactivation occurred in seven of 84
HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive
patients, none of whom had solid tumours.33
Consistent with the findings of that study,
the present data demonstrated that the
patients with solid tumours who were
HBsAg negative, regardless of their anti-
HBs and anti-HBc status, did not have a
high risk of HBV reactivation.
In the present study, HBV reactivation
occurred in three patients, and all three had
haematological malignancies; chronic
lymphocytic leukaemia, acute myeloblastic
leukaemia-promyelocytic leukaemia, and
multiple myeloma. HBV reactivation did
not occur in any of the 22 patients that were
administered rituximab-based therapy or in
any of the 126 patients with solid tumours.
Two patients had pretreatment anti-HBs of
<100 mIU/ml, and one patient had a value
!100 mIU/ml. Two of these three patients
were anti-HBc positive after the chemother-
apy treatment, and one patient who had been
anti-HBc positive prior to chemotherapy was
negative after the treatment. One of the
patients who had been HBsAg negative
before the treatment was still negative after
the treatment, whereas the other two patients
were positive after the treatment. Despite the
prompt treatment of all three patients, one of
them died while the other two patients
recovered in terms of HBV reactivation.
According to the literature, the risk of reacti-
vation is greater in men.5,11,34 However, in the
present study, two of the three patients with
HBV reactivation were women.
In accordance with the current litera-
ture,11,22­24 this present study found that
chemotherapy decreased anti-HBs titres,
particularly in those patients with haemato-
logical malignancies and those that had
received rituximab-based chemotherapy.
The present study investigated the
Yilmaz et al. 635
post-chemotherapy changes in anti-HBs
titres not only in patients that had recovered
from a previous HBV infection but also in
those that had acquired anti-HBs seroposi-
tivity through vaccination. The present data
show that chemotherapy results in a
decrease in anti-HBs titres but that it
increases the risk of reactivation in patients
with haematological malignancies, espe-
cially those with pretreatment anti-HBs of
<100 mIU/ml. Furthermore, the chemother-
apy-induced decline in anti-HBs titres was
more significant in the patients with resolved
hepatitis B infections (i.e. anti-HBc positive
patients) compared with that of the vacci-
nated patients (i.e. anti-HBc negative
patients). These findings might be explained
by possible pathophysiological differences
between vaccination-induced versus HBV
infection-related immunity.
This present study had a number of
strengths and limitations. It included a
large number of patients, demonstrated the
effects of chemotherapy on anti-HBs titres in
solid and haematological malignancies, and
evaluated the changes in antibody positivity
due to HBV vaccination and resolved HBV
infection. However, the limitations included
the retrospective nature of the study, the
absence of HBV DNA data in some
instances, and the heterogeneity of the
chemotherapy regimens used to treat the
malignancies.
In conclusion, consistent with the current
literature on the subject,16,22,23 the results of
the present study suggest that pretreatment
low-level positivity of anti-HBs is a risk
factor for becoming negative for anti-HBs,
particularly in patients with haematological
malignancies who have undergone immuno-
suppressive anticancer therapy. Moreover,
high levels of anti-HBs may have a protect-
ive effect against the reactivation of HBV.
When making a decision about prophylactic
antiviral therapy, the patient's anti-HBs
status and anti-HBs titre, together with
their HBsAg and anti-HBc levels, should
be considered, particularly in high-risk
patients such as HBV carriers, those who
have occult or resolved HBV infection and
patients receiving immunosuppressive antic-
ancer therapy. However, further prospective
trials are needed to clarify this issue.
