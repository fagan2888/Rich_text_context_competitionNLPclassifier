Introduction
Workplace physical violence is a phenomenon that confronts
many countries (Blanchar, 2011). It undermines the safety,
dignity, well-being, and happiness of workers (Bowie,
Fisher, & Cooper, 2012; Hershcovis & Barling, 2010;
Magnavita & Heponiemi, 2011). Besides, it can also affect
organizations adversely through the payment of compensa-
tions, absenteeism, low productivity, dissatisfaction, and
high employee turnover rates among others (Bowie et al.,
2012). According to Kerr (2010), workplace violence is a
leading cause of workplace deaths in the United States, par-
ticularly for women. Severe injuries or death resulting from
workplace physical violence may seem remote in many
countries but its other impacts cannot be underestimated
(Kerr, 2010). The aim of this study was to document the inci-
dence, sources, and effects of workplace physical violence
against Ghanaian nurses.
Workplace violence has become an endemic problem in
health care (Berry, 2013; Nelson, 2014), and nurses are par-
ticularly at a higher risk of abuse (AbuAlRub & Al-Asmar,
2011; Gacki-Smith et al., 2009; Joa & Morken, 2012). About
a quarter of the world's workplace violence occurs in that
sector (Azodo, Ezeja, & Ehikhamenor, 2011). Numerous
studies conducted across different countries such asAustralia
(Bakker, 2012; Hilliar, 2008; Hinchberger, 2009), Japan
(Fujita et al., 2012), United States (Child & Mentes, 2010;
Gacki-Smith et al., 2009; Hanson, Perrin, Moss, Laharnar, &
Glass, 2015), United Kingdom (Lepping, Lanka, Turner,
Stanaway, & Krishna, 2013), China (Kwok et al., 2006),
Switzerland (Hahn et al., 2010), Egypt (Samir, Mohamed,
Moustafa, & Abou Saif, 2012), Jordan (AbuAlRub &
Al-Asmar, 2014; Albashtawy, 2013), and South Africa
(Khalil, 2009) suggest that workplace violence is a problem
for health care workers in both developed and developing
countries.
Workplace physical violence against nurses may vary
across departments/units with emergency, psychiatric, and
intensive care units reputed to have the highest rates of physi-
cal assaults (Darawad, Al-Hussami, Saleh, Mustafa, & Odeh,
2015; Fujita et al., 2012; Hahn et al., 2013; Hahn et al., 2010;
Park, Cho, & Hong, 2015). This has been attributed largely to
thenatureofcasesthattheseunitsusuallyattendto.Depending
on the unit where nurses work, they may experience more
physical violence than other nurses within the same hospital
(Hahn et al., 2013; Hahn et al., 2010).

Workplace Violence Against Nurses:
A Cross-Sectional Descriptive Study of
Ghanaian Nurses
Isaac Mensah Boafo1 and Peter Hancock2
Abstract
The aim of this study was to document the incidence, sources, and effects of workplace physical violence against Ghanaian
nurses. Self-report questionnaires were completed by 592 nurses employed in public general hospitals in Ghana. Participants
were selected using a combination of purposive and random sampling techniques. Nine percent of the participants experienced
physical violence in the 12 months preceding the study. The majority of perpetrators were relatives of patients. Chi-square
tests suggested significant relationships between type of hospital and workplace physical violence, and between intention
to quit the nursing profession and workplace physical violence. Workplace violence had several negative effects on nurses
including having disturbing memories about the incident and being "super alert" and vigilant. Strategies to curb workplace
violence could include awareness creation among health care workers and the general public. Policies and legislations must
also be put in place to address this social problem.

Workplace violence may adversely affect the personal
and professional well-being of nurses. Victims of workplace
violence may suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder,
impaired work performance, and insomnia (AbuAlRub &
Al-Asmar, 2011; Gates, Gillespie, & Succop, 2011; Shahzad
& Malik, 2014). Workplace violence has also been found to
influence nurses' turnover and turnover intentions (Boafo,
Hancock, & Gringart, 2016; Dithisawatwet, Sawaengdee,
Tangcharoensathien, Teerawit, & Thinkamrop, 2014).
In spite of the fact that workplace violence against health
care professionals have become a topical issue in the last
couple of decades (Gabe & Elston, 2008), there is a paucity
of research on the problem in Ghana. Until 2016, when we
(Boafo et al., 2016) published the incidence of verbal abuse
and sexual harassment against Ghanaian nurses, no literature
existed on workplace violence against nurses in the country.
To date, no study has been conducted on the prevalence of
physical violence against nurses in Ghana. However, media
reports on speeches by prominent people in the health care
sector point to the fact that violence against health care pro-
fessionals indeed happens in many Ghanaian health care
facilities. These reports suggest that workplace violence is
not concentrated in psychiatric hospitals but is becoming a
general problem for health care professionals in public hos-
pitals (allAfrica.com). On August 21, 2001, Modern Ghana,
an electronic media organization reported that the Akatsi
District chairperson of the Ghana Registered Nurses
Association (GRNA) stated during the nurses' week celebra-
tion that Ghanaian nurses leave the country to seek greener
pastures in other countries "because we face some risk of
violence coupled with poor salaries and wages" ("Only
9,000 Nurses in the Country," 2001). This is an indication of
the prevalence and importance of violence as a variable to
the retention of the already inadequate number of nurses in the
country (Ghana Health Service, 2010). Furthermore, in a
symposium organized as part of the health service week cel-
ebrations in 2010 by the Health Services Workers'Union, the
parliament of Ghana was implored to consider enacting laws
on violence against health care workers to ensure that health
care personnel worked in an atmosphere of peace. It was
noted that violent attacks on health care workers were appall-
ing, and there was the need for legislation on the issue to
ensure maximum health care delivery ("Health Personnel
Want Legislation," 2010). There has indeed been a situation
where the health workers of a hospital have gone on strike to
protest against assault on some of their colleagues by sec-
tions of the public ("Doctors at LEKMA Stay Away From
Duty," 2011). Furthermore, Boafo et al. (2016) reported high
incidence of nonphysical violence among the sample
reported in this article.
These reports give a cause to worry considering the fact
that workplace violence is associated with intentions to
leave the nursing profession (Boafo et al., 2016;
Dithisawatwet et al., 2014). In Ghana, the nurse­patient
ratio is low, and it is still worsening, a situation that is
described in the 2012 annual progress report on the imple-
mentation of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development
Agenda ("Ghana's Doctor-to-Patient Ratio Worsens,"
2014). The report showed that the nurse­population ratio
for the country worsened from one nurse to 1,240 people in
2011 to 1,251 people in 2012. This was against the back-
drop that the set target for the year 2012 was one nurse to
900 people. In fact, the World Health Report (2006; as cited
in Gyamfi, 2011) classified Ghana among 57 countries
which suffer a critical shortage of health care professionals
including nurses. Moreover, added to these problems is that
a significant number of nurses are lost through emigration
(Buchan & Dovlo, 2004). It therefore becomes imperative
to address the issue of violence against nurses so that it
does not exacerbate the situation of there being an insuffi-
cient number of nurses in the country.
Any policy or legislation seeking to address the problem
of workplace physical violence in the health care sector
must, however, be based on evidence regarding the sources
and magnitude of the problem. It has been suggested that
governments' failure to collect data on violence against
nurses accounts for the inability to make effective policies to
address the problem (Boafo et al., 2016; International
Council of Nurses [ICN], 2000). Although numerous studies
have been conducted on the phenomenon in different coun-
tries, it is only possible to apply their results to Ghana to a
limited extent. The reasons for this, among others, may be
found in the differing organizational structures of health
care, and in differing training and qualification of health care
staff, as well as varying sociocultural context. The risk of
violence, for instance, may be understood differently by peo-
ple depending on their cultural backgrounds and position
within the health care institution. It is in relation to these that
the current article documents the incidence and distribution
of physical violence against nurses in Ghana. Three main
research questions are addressed:
Research Question 1: What is the incidence rate of
workplace physical violence against nurses in Ghana?
Research Question 2: What are the effects of workplace
physical violence against nurses in Ghana?
Research Question 3: Is there a relationship between
workplace physical violence and intention to quit the
nursing profession?
Definition of Workplace Violence
The study upon which this article is based adopts the interna-
tionally recognized definition by the World Health
Organization (WHO) for workplace violence. It defined
workplace violence as "incidents where staff are abused,
threatened, or assaulted in circumstances related to their
work . . . involving an explicit or implicit challenge to their
safety, well-being or health" (Wang, Hayes, & O'Brien-
Pallas, 2008, p. 31). This definition incorporates all the forms
Boafo and Hancock 3
of workplace violence such as physical violence, verbal vio-
lence, sexual abuse, and so on.
The definition further provides descriptions of actions
that constitute each of the various types of violence. The sub-
ject of this article, physical violence, includes "beating, slap-
ping, shooting, pinching, scratching, and biting that cause
physical, sexual or psychological harm to the worker" (Di
Martino, 2002, p. 11).
Method
Sampling and Procedures
A multistage sampling technique was used in the current
study. Data were collected between September 2013 and
April 2014 through the use of questionnaires. A total of 12
hospitals were involved in the study.
The first stage of the sampling procedures involved pur-
posively selecting two teaching hospitals. Korle Bu and
Tamale Teaching Hospitals were selected to ensure that there
was a southern­northern balance. Five regional hospitals
were selected from five randomly selected regions of Ghana.
The final stage of hospital selection involved randomly
selecting one district hospital from each of the chosen
regions. To ensure that nurses working on all shifts were cov-
ered, the data collection took place between 12:00 p.m. and
9:00 p.m. Data were collected by the corresponding author
and four trained research assistants.
In each hospital, nurses were selected from the various
units/departments through simple random sampling. The
inclusion criteria for the study were as follows: (a) a partici-
pant should be a qualified nurse, and (b) a participant should
have at least 1 year nursing experience. A total of 1,021
nurses were requested to get involved in the study, and 685
accepted to be part by completing a questionnaire. However,
89 of the questionnaires were not properly completed, and
were not included in the analyses. Four participants were
found to be deputy directors of nursing services and were
also removed from the analyses because they were too few in
number for any significant statistical analysis. At the end, the
data presented here are that received from 592 participants.
Measures
The International Labour Organization, ICN, the WHO, and
the Public Services International's (ILO/ICN/WHO/PSI,
2003) Health Sector Workplace Violence Questionnaire was
adapted for the current article. Sections in the questionnaire
such as bullying and racial harassment and other items which
fell outside the purview of the study were removed. The
adjusted questionnaire was reviewed by five professional
nurses for face validity, clarity, and sensitivity of items.
Physical violence was recorded using a single-item scale.
Participants were asked "In the last 12 months, have you
been physically attacked in your workplace?" (yes/no). In
view of this, it was not possible to determine its reliability by
Cronbach's alpha. However, before the start of the study, the
instrument was tested on 20 nurses who were not part of the
study on two occasions with a 2-week interval. The test­
retest correlation coefficient (Nagy, 2002) for physical vio-
lence was 1.00.
This questionnaire was adopted because it has been used
in several studies across different countries such as Iran
(Esmaeilpour, Salsali, & Ahmadi, 2011), Jordan (AbuAlRub
& Al-Asmar, 2011), Brazil, Lebanon, Portugal, Bulgaria, and
Thailand (Di Martino, 2002). In Africa, it has been used in
South Africa (Steinman, 2003) and Mozambique (Adam,
Caldas, Aly, & Capece, 2003). The current study is, there-
fore, comparable with other studies within and outside
Africa.
The research instrument was also used to collect data on
nurses' intentions to quit the nursing profession. It adopted
the approach of Kankaanranta and Rissanen (2008) by using
single-item categorical (dichotomous) variable to measure
intention to quit. Participants were asked, "Do you have the
intention of quitting your job as a nurse in the near future?"
The structure of this item is also the same as the one which
was used to measure Ghanaian nurses' emigration intentions
(Anarfi, Quartey, & Agyei, 2010). The test­retest correlation
coefficient for the intention to quit variable was .9. Details of
the methods used for the study have been published else-
where (Boafo et al., 2016).
Ethical Issues
Ethical clearances were given by the Edith Cowan
University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)
and the Ghana Health Service Ethics Review Committee.
Permissions were also given by the medical superintendent
or hospital administrator (where appropriate) and the head
of nursing services of each hospital prior to the commence-
ment of data collection. The aim of the study was explained
to all participants, and they were assured of confidentiality.
Participants were not allowed to write their names or any
other information that could be used to trace them on the
questionnaire. They were asked to retain the questionnaires
until the researcher or research assistants came around to
collect them. Participation in the study was voluntary, and
participants were at liberty to pull out of the study without
any consequences.
Data Analyses
The data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Version 20.
Frequencies, means, and standard deviations (SDs) were
used to describe the sociodemographic and workplace char-
acteristics of participants and to establish the incidence and
sources of workplace violence. Chi-square test was used to
test the association between workplace physical violence and
sociodemographic characteristics. It was also used in testing

the association between workplace physical violence and
intention to quit the nursing profession.
Results
Demographic and Workplace Characteristics
The demographic and workplace characteristics of the
research participants are presented in Table 1. The sample
consisted of 592 nurses. More than a third (42.1%) were
nurses in the Greater Accra Region and 22% worked in the
Eastern Region. One third (32.9%) of the participants worked
in teaching hospitals, 38.7% worked in regional hospitals,
and a further 28.4% were nurses in district hospitals.
In terms of gender, 79.2% of the sample were females and
20.8% were males. The majority (52.5%) of the participants
were not married. The mean age of the sample was 31.76
years (SD = 9.53); the minimum and maximum ages were 21
and 60 years, respectively. In all, 61.3% of participants had a
diploma qualification, and 52.0% were staff nurses. On the
average, participants had worked in nursing for 7.38 years
(SD = 9.53). Less than a fifth (16.9%) worked in the outpa-
tient department (OPD), and more than a quarter (35.3%)
were employed in the medical and surgical units.
In relation to established protocol for reporting workplace
violence against nurses, 72.1% reported that such protocols
existed, and 80.1% of these reported they know how follow
through these procedures. The mean score for nurses' con-
cern over workplace violence suggested that nurses were
moderately concerned about workplace violence; however,
the mode revealed a contrary view. A relative majority of the
sample were extremely concerned about workplace violence
(minimum = 1, maximum = 5, M = 3.05, SD = 1.51, mode =
5). The demographic and workplace characteristics of the
study sample have also been published elsewhere (Boafo
et al., 2016).
Incidence and Sources of Physical Workplace
Violence
The results as presented in Table 2 showed that, of the 592
nurses included in the study, 53 (9.0%) had experienced
physical violence in the 12 months prior to the study. Of
these, 42 (79.2%) were females and 11 (20.8%) were males.
Chi-square analysis showed that this difference was statisti-
cally not significant. In terms of regional distribution of the
incidence of workplace physical violence against nurses,
32.1% of victims were nurses in the Greater Accra region,
and 22.6% in the Eastern and Ashanti regions. Regional dif-
ferences in exposure to physical violence were also not sta-
tistically significant.
Workplace physical violence against nurses was perpe-
trated by patients and their relatives, other nurses, and doc-
tors. The results showed that relatives of patients were the
most frequent perpetrators of physical violence against
nurses. They were responsible for more than half (58.5%) of
physical violence perpetrated against nurses. The analyses
further showed that 20.8% of those who were physically

abused got injured, and 17% were given formal treatment
following the attack. Nurses who were physically abused
took an average of 11.5 days off (SD = 20.05, mode = 2), and
had worked for an average of 5.96 years (SD = 7.54).
It is also noteworthy that more than two thirds of the vic-
tims were within the age range of 21 to 30 years.
Correspondingly, junior nurses formed almost three quarters
(73.6%) of victims. Although statistically there was no sig-
nificant association between position or rank and physical
violence, it is worth noting that physical violence was far less
for senior nurses (nursing officer and above) compared with
their junior counterparts.
In terms of incidence across units, it was found that 35.8%
(19) of nurses who suffered workplace physical violence
worked at the medical and surgical units. This was followed
by the special units (24.5%) and then the OPD (20.8%).
However, chi-square test showed no statistically significant
association between unit where one worked and physical
violence. There was, however, a statistically significant asso-
ciation between physical workplace abuse and the type of
hospital, with nurses in the regional hospitals being more
likely to be abused physically in the workplace, 2(N = 592,
df = 2) = 9.720, p = .01.
Effects and Reactions to Workplace Physical
Violence
As shown in Table 3, reactions to physical violence ranged
fromtakingnoactiontopursuingprosecution.Encouragingly,
the most frequent (35.8%) response to physical violence was
reporting to a senior staff member/unit in charge. This was
followed by telling a colleague about the incident (32.1%)
and then taking no action (18.8%). Thirty-one percent of the
respondents who have been abused indicated that action was
taken to investigate the causes of the incident. All investiga-
tions were initiated by the nursing administration/unit in
charge.
Only 9.8% of cases were reported to the police. A relative
majority (43.9%) of attackers were given verbal warning.
Those who did not report the incident provided various rea-
sons for doing so; more than one third (36%) believed it was
not important to report, and 32% thought no action will be
taken if reported. Indeed, if no action will be taken if reported,
then it is not important to report. Being extremely "super
alert" or watchful and on guard was the most frequently
reported effect of workplace physical violence. Data on the
reactions to workplace physical violence and its effects are
presented in Table 4.
One fifth (19.9%) of participants in the entire sample indi-
cated they had intentions of quitting the nursing profession
(not shown in table). Chi-square test showed a statistically
significant association between the experience of physical
violence and intention to quit the nursing profession, 2(N =
586, df = 1) = 11.22, p = .001. The unadjusted odds ratio
computed from the cross-tabulations indicated that nurses

violence.
Discussion
The current article corroborates the findings of several stud-
ies that indicate that nurses are exposed to high rates of
workplace violence, and that the phenomenon has the ten-
dency to negatively affect nurses and the health delivery sys-
tem in general (AbuAlRub & Al-Asmar, 2011; Esmaeilpour
et al., 2011). Although the incidence of physical workplace
violence found among Ghanaian nurses (9.0%) was lower
than what has been reported by many other studies on the
subject (17%-27%; e.g., AbuAlRub & Al-Asmar, 2011;
Darawad et al., 2015; Gacki-Smith et al., 2009; Natan,
Hanukayev, & Fares, 2011; Samir et al., 2012; Steinman,
2003), the impact was no less, as 41.2% of participants who
suffered physical violence reported that they became
extremely "super alert" and on guard. This finding, which is
consistent with studies such as AbuAlRub and Al-Asmar
(2011) and Esmaeilpour et al. (2011) (who also reported that
a significant proportion of participants in their studies who
were exposed to physical violence became extremely super
alert), is disturbing and necessitates the formulation of poli-
cies to address the problem. This is because quality care
partly depends on the quality of the relationship between
nurses and clients. Obviously, nurses cannot deliver high
quality service if they are overly alert as a result of the expe-
rience of violence. It has been confirmed by research that
workplace physical violence negatively affects the services
nurses provide (Gates et al., 2011).
The article also showed that workplace physical violence
has implications for the retention of the already insufficient
number of nurses in Ghana. A statistically significant asso-
ciation was found between physical violence and intention to
quit the nursing profession. This finding corroborates the
results of several studies (e.g., Dithisawatwet et al., 2014;
Nachreiner et al., 2007; Sofield & Salmond, 2003) which
have linked workplace violence to nurses leaving the
profession.
Unlike what has been reported in several studies, there was
no statistically significant association between physical vio-
lence and the unit where one worked. This suggests that phys-
ical violence is a generalized phenomenon in general hospitals
in Ghana, and not concentrated in any particular unit or
department. However, there was a statistically significant
association between hospital type and the incidence of vio-
lence with regional hospitals recording the highest incidence.
This situation may be due to the inadequate security coupled

with the high number of patients that regional hospitals attend
to. In a Jordanian study, Darawad et al. (2015) reported over-
crowding and workload to be the most common cause of vio-
lence against nurses.
About a tenth (9.0%) of the participants reported to have
experienced physical violence. Most of the violent incidents
which occurred in the workplace were perpetrated by patients
and their relatives, and a significant number of such inci-
dents were not reported. The two most frequent reasons
given for not reporting physical violence was "it was not
important," and "I thought no action will be taken if
reported." Certainly, it is not important to report an incident
if one thinks that nothing will be done after a report is made.
It is therefore important that clear measures are put in place
to address the problem. Necessary action must be taken
against perpetrators of violence, and nurses who report vio-
lence against them should be informed of what action has
been taken against the offender.
Limitations
This study excludes nurses working in clinics and health
posts located in rural and or remote areas of the country.
Nurses working in private hospitals were also not included in
the study. The findings of the current study may thus not be
generalizable to these sections of Ghanaian nurses. As an
inherent weakness of cross-sectional surveys, no cause and
effect relationships can be established from the current study.
Recommendations for Future Research and
Practice
Future studies could explore whether there are differences in
violence exposure among nurses in the private and public
health sectors. It will also be useful to have longitudinal stud-
ies conducted to ascertain whether intention to quit leads to
actual quitting behavior among Ghanaian nurses, consider-
ing the fact that unemployment rates are high in the country.
On how to curb the phenomenon of workplace physical
violence against Ghanaian nurses, the current article recom-
mends the following:
·
· Educational campaigns could be carried out to consci-
entize the public on the matter. Legislations and "zero
tolerance" of violence policies must be formulated to
combat the problem.
·
· Clear reporting procedures must be established by
hospitals, and nurses encouraged to report violence
against them.
·
· Reports of violence must be acted upon in a timely
manner, and affected nurses given necessary support.
·
· Finally, it is important that security is boosted at the
various government hospitals, especially the regional
hospitals.
Conclusion
The findings in this article are consistent with several studies
which have found workplace violence to be a major problem
for nurses. The most frequent perpetrators of physical vio-
lence were patients' relations. It is recommended that educa-
tional programs are designed to foster awareness on the
phenomena and their impacts on nurses and the health care
delivery. It is also recommended that clear policies are insti-
tuted to address the problem.
