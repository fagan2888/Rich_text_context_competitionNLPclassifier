Abstract
Positive effects of aesthetically appreciated designs have long been studied and confirmed since the
19th century: such designs are more enjoyable, they are more forgivable for glitches and can
increase users' performance. In the field of information visualization, studies of aesthetics are still
a niche approach. In the current study, we aim to specifically understand which parameters in a
visualization of node-link diagrams make them aesthetically pleasing-an important extension
to already existing research on usability and readability aspects. We investigated how the shape
of the outline of such diagrams influences the aesthetic judgments on two of the most important
dimensions of aesthetic appeal: beauty and interest. We employed different outlines to node-link
diagrams and compared them with uniformly filled shapes, varying two important variables
typically impacting aesthetics: complexity and curvature. This was done for a short (100 ms)
and ad libitum presentation time. Diagrams with curvier outlines were perceived as more
beautiful, while diagrams with more complex outlines were considered to be more interesting.

These dependencies already exist for presaccadic perception (100 ms) and are slightly stronger for
unlimited presentation time. We also found that curvature is a predictor for beauty only for
unlimited presentation time. Aesthetic appeal was very similar for diagrams and pure shapes,
so many results from fundamental research on aesthetics can potentially be transferred to the
community of network visualization, assisting to improve visualizations also in aesthetic regards.

Introduction
Aesthetics can be defined as ``a concept that relates to the beauty in both nature and art, as
something that enlivens or invigorates both body and mind, awakening our senses''
(Cawthon & Moere, 2007, p. 1). It can also be defined in a very much broader sense to
underline the relevance of aesthetics for a series of cognitive and affective processes:
``To understand what people appreciate, like, love, or prefer, and why they do so is of
essential relevance for everyday life events where a clear rational basis for decision making
is often not available'' (Carbon & Jakesch, 2013, p. 2123).
Individuals from various disciplines have tried to understand the notion of aesthetics by
applying the tools available to them: Philosophers tried to explain it using human language,
artists investigated the meaning and the boundaries of aesthetics by producing pieces of art
and exposing them to human judgment, cognitive psychologists explored it by applying
statistical analysis to the results of controlled user studies measuring human responses,
and mathematicians tried to measure it defining a plethora of analytic functions.
It is not surprising that in the field of Information Visualization (InfoVis--the study of
visual representations of abstract data to be optimally processed by humans), which deals
with visual representations of data, the investigation of aesthetics to increase insight was
listed as one of the ten most important open problems: ``Engineering aesthetics into
information visualization remains a challenge'' (Chen, 2005, p. 15). The importance of this
problem is explained by previous investigations indicating that aesthetics can positively affect
apparent and actual usability (Kurosu & Kashimura, 1995; Norman, 2002; Tractinsky, Katz,
& Ikar, 2000) and is, more generally, related to positive mental states, promoting problem-
solving abilities (Fredrickson, 1998; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987). Aesthetics plays a
significant role in a system's overall attractiveness (Carbon & Leder, 2005; Tractinsky,
Cokhavi, & Kirschenbaum, 2004) as a significant incentive for initial use and beyond--it
gives pleasure to the user (Biederman & Vessel, 2006)!
In the field of Graph Drawing, the term ``aesthetics'' has been heavily used; however,
``aesthetics'' refers there to metrics on node-link diagrams that intuitively determine their
usability and readability (Kaufmann & Wagner, 2001), rather than to the aesthetic quality of
their appearance. Examples of such metrics are, inter alia, number of edge1 crossings, number
of edge bends, and angular resolution (refer to Figure 1). The connection of those metrics to
user performance has been studied empirically (e.g., Huang, Hong, & Eades, 2006; Huang,
Huang, & Lin, 2016; Purchase, 1997; Purchase, Hamer, Nollenburg, & Kobourov, 2012;
Ware, Purchase, Colpoys, & McGill, 2002). Node-link diagrams have been empirically
2 i-Perception 9(5)
studied from the perspective of enjoyment (Saket, Scheidegger, & Kobourov, 2016) and
subjective usability prospects (Huang et al., 2006; Purchase, Allder, & Carrington, 2002;
Purchase, Hamer, et al., 2012). However, the extent to which these metrics determine the
aesthetics in the sense of perceived beauty of node-link diagrams is far from being
understood.
In several experiments (Dwyer et al., 2009; Purchase, Pilcher, & Plimmer, 2012; van Ham
& Rogowitz, 2008), researchers asked participants to create node-link diagrams themselves
by using various interactive environments which allowed for operations of node movements
and edge modifications. The studies similarly showed that users tend to minimize edge
crossings. Some other evident properties that participants payed attention to were:
revealing the graph clustering, and in opposite, maintaining similar distances between
nodes, enclosing clusters within bounding hulls, symmetrizing, keeping the edges short,
and placing the node with the highest degree centrally or above.
The Present Study
Motivated by the finding of van Ham and Rogowitz (2008) that observers construe a
bounding hull to ``visually delineate'' (p. 1339) a cluster of nodes in a diagram, we asked
ourselves whether such a simple characteristic like the shape of a node diagram's outline
might be a parameter of aesthetic appeal worthwhile to study. To dig into the core of this
question, in the present study, we only look at the outline of the whole node-link diagram
rather on outlines of the individual clusters. This focus is grounded in Gestalt theory of
perception: Boundary edges and contours contribute to the separation of figure from the
ground (see also Wong & Sun, 2006) and thus are among the most important distinctive
features that make a graph a distinctive, self-contained object.
Since people generally prefer and enjoy objects that seem beautiful to them (Norman,
2002), we investigated, first of all, the subjective ratings of beauty of node-link diagrams.
Beauty is probably ``the'' most important variable in aesthetics all along, starting in
philosophy of aesthetics (e.g., Kant, 1790/1922) up to very recent psychological theories
(e.g., Reber, Schwarz, & Winkielman, 2004)--it is also the concept mostly referred
to when people have to judge the aesthetics of objects (Jacobsen, Buchta, Ko
¨ hler, &
Schroger, 2004) or when they are asked to describe artworks (Augustin, Carbon,
& Wagemans, 2012) or design products such as cars or clothing (Augustin, Wagemans, &
Figure 1. An example of optimization of various metrics for a construction of a readable node-link diagram:
(a) An arbitrary node-link diagram, (b) a different node-link diagram of the same graph, where two edges are
redrawn using bent polylines to reduce the number of crossings, (c) the nodes are repositioned to achieve a
straight-line drawing without crossings, and (d) the nodes are repositioned to make the angles around nodes
as even as possible.
Carbon et al. 3
Carbon, 2012). It is also known that beauty alone is not enough to keep the viewers
investigating a visual stimulus (Silvia, 2005).
There is actually evidence that interest, as a variable known to indicate potential longer
termed engagement with respective stimuli, predates moments of insight, that is, experiences
of suddenly understanding a complex visual structure (Muth, Raab, & Carbon, 2015). Thus,
alongside with beauty, we followed the idea of Silvia (2005) and investigated the interest
triggered by the stimuli. There is an analog to these ideas from the area of display design,
where it is recommended to create displays that at first glance are aesthetically interesting and
convey information on closer examination (Fogarty, Forlizzi, & Hudson, 2001).
Curvature has been identified as a typical physical predictor of beauty and is being
preferred against angularity in many object classes (for an overview Gomez-Puerto,
Munar, & Nadal, 2016), for instance concrete consumer products (Westerman et al.,
2012), car interiors (Leder & Carbon, 2005) or car exteriors (Carbon, 2010), but also for
meaningless or abstracted material such as polygons (Silvia & Barona, 2009)--Bar and Neta
(2006) even claimed quite generally ``Humans prefer curved visual objects'', a finding which
was also replicated in the haptic domain (see Carbon & Jakesch, 2013; Jakesch & Carbon,
2011). This general preference is not without doubt, especially when specific designs are
susceptible to Zeitgeist effects (Carbon, 2010), which however seem to play no essential
role in the present study addressing graphs and mere shapes with no direct connection to
products or objects. General positive associative factors with curved shapes documented by
Palumbo, Ruta, and Bertamini (2015) seem to be much more important in the present study,
so we included curvature as a possible predictor for beauty.
Complexity is another prominent candidate for modulating preferences. There are
indications that complexity is a good predictor for interest (see Muth et al., 2015). How
complexity is exactly related to beauty remains unsure as some claim parabolic functions with
medium complex stimuli showing the highest hedonic value (Berlyne, 1970, 1971)--a
construct strongly related to beauty--, while others have empirically revealed simple linear
relationships (e.g., Nadal, Munar, Marty, & Cela-Conde, 2010); very recent research even
challenges any of these strict views, as large individual differences of the link between
complexity and preferences have been documented ever since (Gucluturk, Jacobs, & van
Lier, 2016). Different ranges or distributions of complexity across employed stimuli might
be the cause of this contradiction. The usage of different stimulus classes across studies could
be another factor for this discrepancy, as each class of stimuli might have a specific maximum
of complexity. In a recent study, Adkins and Norman (2016) studied snowflake silhouettes
and computer-generated solid objects of various complexity and observed that the most and
least complex objects were perceived as being the most beautiful, while for the snowflakes, the
results were more uniform. Actually, most participants perceived only the complex
snowflakes as very beautiful.
We preselected a set of shapes that vary in their complexity and curvature and used these
shapes as outlines for node-link diagrams. We controlled the appearance of the node-link
diagrams by only changing their boundaries and by keeping the drawings of the actual graphs
similar. This way we aim to find out whether the perceived beauty of the visualization can be
influenced without changing the values of visualization metrics that possibly affect the
usability of these visualizations. To understand whether the beauty of the node-link
diagrams can be predicted by the shape of their outlines, we conducted the experiment
both for node-link diagrams and for pure shapes (Figure 2). To further test whether the
outline of the node-link diagrams contribute the first impression they make, we investigated
all research questions with a short, presaccadic presentation time (PT ¼ 100 ms) and
compared the results to a presentation with unlimited time.

Study
Method
Rationale. Our first goal was to investigate whether the curvature and the complexity of the
outlines of node-link diagrams influence the perceived beauty and trigger interest. An
existence of such an influence can give hints to the designers of node-link diagrams on
how to attract a viewer's attention to investigate the node-link diagram.
Our second goal was to understand whether the beauty and the interest ratings are similar
for the shapes and for the node-link diagrams using those shapes as outlines. This is an
important question, as we know much more about the beauty of shapes than about the
beauty of node-link diagrams. A positive answer to this question would give us hints on
what node-link diagrams should look like to be attractive to humans.
Our third goal was to understand whether the very first impression of a node-link
diagram's beauty is different from a judgment after a more thorough visual inspection. To
investigate this question, we utilize Norman's (2005) simple human perception model which
distinguishes three levels of perception: (a) The visceral level is responsible for the initial
judgment of things, our intuitive reactions, for example, responsible for identification of
dangerous situations. (b) The behavioral level is responsible for automated routines of
perception and action, for example, playing piano and driving a car. (c) The reflective level
is responsible for conscious thinking and access of memories. To capture the intuitive
responses of the participants, staying closer to the visceral level of perception, we exposed
the participants to the stimuli for 100 ms, a time interval before the first saccade, the first eye
movement away from the initial fixation point, usually takes place. We compared this to a
second condition, where--ceteris paribus--the participants are exposed to the same stimuli
for unlimited time, which we consider representative for a more behavioral mode of
perception sensu Norman.
Procedure. Figure 3 shows a brief illustration of the experimental design. To avoid a carry-
over effect (assessments for node-link diagrams influencing the shape assessments and vice
versa), we randomly assigned participants to two different groups, one exposed to shapes,
and the other exposed to node-link diagrams. In the following, we describe the design of the
experiment for the shapes. The procedure with node-link diagrams is identical, with the only
difference that instead of shapes, node-link diagrams of graphs using that shape as outline
were employed. We tried to keep the study short ($10 min), to avoid boredom of the
participants and therefore lack of concentration.

The study was divided into two blocks: In the first block, the PT for stimuli was 100 ms,2
whereas in the second block, the stimuli remained on screen until key press. Each block
comprised four subblocks where we asked for participants' assessments stimuli regarding
curvature, complexity, interest, and beauty, respectively. The order of subblocks was fixed.
Curvature and complexity were regarded as independent ``object-specific'' variables, whereas
beauty and interest were treated as dependent variables.
Since perceptual differences between stimuli are in many cases quite small, we looked for a
measurement that is sensitive enough to uncover such subtleties. The typical employed rating
scale method is a very efficient but not the most sensitive method to capture preference
assessments. In contrast, paired comparisons offer much better sensitivity than rating
scales in detecting differences (see Eisenberg & Dirks, 1995), so we employed such a high-
sensitive pairwise comparison task, especially as we used a PT limitation paradigm. The
participants were asked to select whether the left or right stimulus was ``clearly more''
(¼3), ``more'' (¼2), or ``weakly more'' (¼1), for example, curvy (or: complex, interesting,
beautiful, respectively) than the right or left stimulus, respectively.

Every subblock (e.g., Subblock 1 curvature) consisted of eight trials, and every trial
presented two distinct stimuli to the viewer side by side. We kept possible preference
biases based on the mere-exposure effect (Zajonc, 2001) constant across stimuli by means
of counterbalancing. In particular, each stimulus was presented only once within a subblock,
and therefore each stimulus is seen by the viewer exactly eight times (two PTs by four
subblocks). For each subblock, the eight pairs were randomly drawn from the set of all
possible 120 pairs (refer to stimuli section), and the chosen pairs were not considered for
the selection in the following subblocks. Overall, k ¼ 4 Â 8 ¼ 32 distinct pairs of stimuli were
shown in the first block. In the second block, the same 32 pairs were presented, but the order
of trials was randomized anew within each subblock.
The study was implemented on an online platform developed based on Django framework
(https://www.djangoproject.com)--a free and open-source web framework, written in
Python. The procedure started with a welcome message and a brief introduction to the
experiment. Participants were requested to spontaneously select which stimulus showed the
regarding variable more than the other stimulus of the pair. For instance, in the first subblock
(curvature), they were asked ``Which visual object appears more round to you?'' The
regarding questions of the subsequent blocks were about which object was more complex,
more interesting, and more beautiful, respectively. Note: we used ``round'' instead of
``curved,'' as our pilot studies indicated that participants had a better intuitive
understanding of an item that is ``round'' instead of ``curved'' (see Carbon, 2010).
In the first block, each trial started with a centered fixation cross (1000 ms)--for the
unlimited PT in the second block, this fixation cross was not present to make implicitly
clear that fast reactions were not demanded for this part of the experiment. Subsequently,
a pair of stimuli was presented side by side (Figure 4) for 100 ms (first block) or as long as the
participant answered the regarding question (second block). In the first block, we masked the

display subsequently with a backward mask of white noise for 100 ms, in order to minimize
visual persistence beyond the time of presentation. The next trial started as soon as the
participant entered an answer by pushing a target button. The whole study took on
average 10 minutes per person.
Stimuli. In a preliminary step, we created 138 shapes with different appearances regarding
curvature and complexity, as diverse as possible. With an internal expert pilot study with five
raters, we got ratings for curvature and complexity for all shapes. We calculated the mode for
each shape and both properties to select a representative shape (best fit) for each of the 16
curvature or complexity combinations, since our goal was to investigate how beauty and
interest are explained by curvature and complexity. Fleiss' kappa (k) test, a statistical
measure for calculating the reliability of agreement between raters, revealed ``substantial''
interrater agreement (according to Landis & Koch, 1977) for the selected shapes: k ¼ 0.68 for
curvature and k ¼ 0.72 for complexity. See Figure 5 for the finally preselected shape stimuli.
On basis of those selected shapes, we constructed node-link diagrams that employ exactly
the respective shapes as outlines. As graphs, we used six randomly generated Delaunay
triangulations with 200 nodes. These graphs generally have long boundaries, a property
that was required to realize sufficiently complex outlines.
For constructing a node-link diagram of a graph having a given shape as outline, we used
a force-directed approach (Jacomy, Venturini, Heymann, & Bastian, 2014)--an algorithm

the pilot study).

that simulates a physical system where the nodes are physical bodies, that attract or repel
each other dependent of whether the nodes are connected by an edge or not. This physical
system is let go until it achieves an equilibrium. See Figure 6 for a depiction of the algorithmic
procedure to create the node-link stimuli.
Initially, a planar layout was constructed, and the nodes that were suitable to lay on the
boundary were detected (for the pipeline of the algorithmic procedure, refer to Figure 6).
These are not exactly the boundary nodes, since those are usually not enough to mimic the
outline of the given shape. These nodes are distributed on the outline of the given shape. The
remaining nodes are put inside the outline, and the force-directed method is run, by keeping
the positions of the outer nodes fixed. Finally, the edges that connect two points of the
outline and do not lie inside the shape are colored gray, to achieve the similarity with the
given shape. Note: Our node-link diagrams are visualizing six planar graphs with very specific
properties. By using polyline or curvilinear edges, a similar drawing algorithm could be
applied to all planar graphs, and the overall appearance of the graph is similar. However,
the results have to be generalized with caution for nonplanar graphs, specifically with many
crossings.
For the k ¼ (16 Â 15)/2 ¼ 120 possible pairs of shape stimuli, we generated two images, for
two possible selections of the shape placed on the left. For each shape stimulus and each of
the six graphs, we constructed the corresponding graph stimulus, which showed the selected
graph within the outline represented by the shape.

lottery and provided us their e-mail address. Those addresses were stored separately from the
remaining data to protect privacy.
Altogether N ¼ 233 people participated in the online study, from which 111 were assigned
to shape and 122 to graph conditions with average age 29.4 years and 30.9 years, respectively.
With respect to gender, 117 were female, 103 male, and 13 stated other. The origin of the
participants was mainly from Germany (71.0%), followed by users from United States
(12.5%), Great Britain (2.6%), Austria (2.2%), and 18 other countries. Regarding the
education, 6.0% had a PhD, 33.1% a master or diploma degree, 27.0% a bachelor degree,
and 32.6% indicated high school as highest gained level of education--1.3% declared having
no education of the asked categories.
Note: The sample employed in our study was restricted to people with Internet access and
is biased toward people who consume the websites that we used for recruitment or who were
associated with the authors' circle of acquaintances. No other confounding was evident.
Results and Discussion
We incorporated all participants' data in the following analyses. Since the data are based on
pairwise comparisons, we obtained one explicit rating that we further processed in the
following way: a positive rating for the chosen object and a negative rating with same
absolute value for the other. Shapiro­Wilk tests indicated that the data were not
statistically deviant from being normally distributed.
When time was not restricted, participants took about 3 s to evaluate a graph or a shape,
which indicates that judgments were not just visceral reactions (in Norman's sense), but were
processed with conscious awareness (behavioral level). The mean response time in the
unlimited conditions was 2907.1 ms for graph and 2763.9 ms for shape conditions.
To obtain an overview of how the ratings of beauty and interest vary over the two
presentation types (shapes vs. graph) and the two PTs, we plotted the two dependent
measures beauty and interest for all 2 Â 2 ¼ 4 experimental conditions (Figure 7). Our first
perceptual inspection of the data made clear that we revealed a generally high similarity of
ratings across experimental conditions.
A statistical analysis of the correlations between the dependent variables for both PTs and
for all collected variables showed, however, that beauty assessments were seemingly based on
different features or processes when facing limited (100 ms) compared with ad libitum PT,
R(16) ¼ .780, p ¼ .0004. For interest, we revealed much closer relationship between both PT
conditions, R(16) ¼ .871, p < .0001. The high, but still far from perfect relationships between
PT conditions, point to potential ``microgenetic processes'' (Bachmann, 2000) which have
already been progressed quite far when a stimulus of the used kind is presented for only
100 ms, but where further processing is still going on (Carbon, 2011). Interestingly, such an
ongoing microgenesis was not detectable for the predictors complexity and curvature, which
showed nearly perfectly identical assessments at a PT of 100 ms and also in the case of
unlimited PT, that is, R(16) ¼ .960, p < .0001 and R(16) ¼ .978, p < .0001, respectively. This
indicates that complexity and curvature assessments do not require very deep cognitive
processing as they are reliably processed even under very limited presentation conditions. As
such, both factors might be interpreted more like content factors than style factors following
the style-follows-content hypothesis of microgenesis in scene perception (Augustin,
Defranceschi, Fuchs, Carbon, & Hutzler, 2011; Augustin, Leder, Hutzler, & Carbon, 2008).
As we were particularly interested in how beauty and interest can be predicted taking
our independent variables curvature and complexity simultaneously as predictors,
10 i-Perception 9(5)
we furthermore conducted two separate linear regression analyses for each PT condition.
Refer also to Figure 8 for the scatter plots of all four variables plus their interrelationships.
As indicated in Table 1, we obtained high rates of explained variances in general.
Beauty was mainly based on curvature aspects, at 100 ms actually exclusively on curvature.
When PT was not limited, also complexity was taken into account, but here with a negative
relationship: the more complex the stimulus, the less participants liked it. With curvature, it
was quite similar across PT conditions: The rounder the stimulus was assessed, the higher it
was assessed regarding beauty--a shape that is very near to a circular form was appreciated
the most. Actually, reports of preferences for round shapes are quite numerous (see Gomez-
Puerto et al., 2016), so these results were fully expected and reflect typical data from more
complex domains of everyday objects (Westerman et al., 2012), including other modalities
such as the haptic sense (Jakesch & Carbon, 2011).
For interest, we gained a very different data pattern: Here the essential factor was always
complexity, with more complex stimuli being assessed more interesting--a finding that is
compatible with other domains of visual stimuli such as artworks (Friston, Thornton, &
Clark, 2012; Muth et al., 2015).
General Discussion
We investigated the role of curvature and complexity of the outlines of node-link diagrams as
drivers for generating interest and aesthetic appeal for the users of such types of graphical
information. Therefore, we let 233 persons evaluate node-link diagrams with various outlines
as well as shapes comprised by those outlines.
We found that curvature is a powerful predictor for beauty, but complexity has also its
role when a beholder can inspect the stimulus longer--interestingly, our participants did

their overall mean.

prefer less complex stimuli under unlimited PT conditions regarding beauty. This supports
the findings by Purchase, Hamer, et al. (2012) that node-link diagrams with circular-arc edges
are liked more than straight line drawings. Taken together, this indicates that such aesthetic
principles, which were often shown for artworks and consumer products, play also a role for
visualization of information, for instance, in node-link diagrams.
For being interesting, most importantly, the stimuli have to be more complex--curvature
was not important for being assessed as interesting. This makes clear that interest is not just a
facet of beauty but has its own rules. As interest is an important variable for inducing longer
termed attention to a stimulus, this is very important to know.

The 4-by-4 plot panel is organized the following way: the top-left to bottom-right diagonal shows the
distribution of ratings for curvature, complexity, interest, and beauty, respectively. The upper triangle shows
the regarding bivariate relationships, and the lower triangle additionally provides the linear regressions. All
data are split by the conditions presentation type (graph vs. shape) and presentation time (100 ms vs. unlimited).

We found very similar data pattern for shapes and graphs drawn using those shapes as
outlines, so the very general rule is that the outline should be optimized with priority,
especially if it is about optimizing the beauty of a graph.
The differences found between PTs for the employed stimuli point at a difference in the
conception of beauty that might be explained by a microgenetic view (Bachmann, 2000):
The impact of the outline's curvature is greater at second glance, but interest is crucial from
the very early beginning and mainly triggered by complexity. This is in line with the idea by
Muth et al. (2015) that complex visual structures can be perceived as a promise for an
aesthetic riddle. Complexity might just be a good predictor for the degree of information
density and so triggers attention, a cognitive construct that is very much linked with interest.
This microgenetic view (i.e., the idea that the final ``percept''--what we eventually
perceive--is generated by subsequent perceptual subprocesses, see Carbon [2011]) on the
dynamics of appreciation, has already been established for works of art (Augustin et al.,
2008, 2011) and does seem to be an interesting avenue for future research. The difference in
model fit we have observed here should be taken as a starting point to target the dynamics of
perception unfolding over the first few hundreds of milliseconds. Those dynamics of
unfolding appreciation might have practical implications in situations where information is
competing for observers' attention. Graphs that are appealing at the very first glance might
be the ones that get more attention (or even any attention at all).
So, there is merit in transferring aesthetic principles into the domain of information
visualizations. We have shown that node-edge-structures without semantics, that is,
syntactically well-formed node-graphs generated by random data, are appreciated in a way we
might compare to the appreciation of artworks. There are two promising directions from here:
(1) Expand the syntactical approach (as we have focused on the graphs' outlines here; one
might think of regarding shape and length of edges).
(2) Start to introduce meaning by depicting real-world data (which would allow evaluating if
more beautiful graphs are also more understandable).
Our node-link diagrams were generated by an algorithm and did not allow for any deeper
insight. A further study should address riddle-solving aspects of appreciation by using node-

Notes
1. A graph usually consists of several nodes (aka vertices), where a node represents a data point, that
are usually depicted by dots or circles. Edges are nondirectional connections between such nodes,
representing some kind of relation. A node does not have to have any edge connections, and the
number of edges a single node is connected to is not limited. However, any edge must be connected
to a node at both ends. Beyond these syntactic rules, any meaning (What is represented by a node?
What kind of relation is implied by an edge?) is domain-specific. For a given graph (i.e., fixed node-
edge-system), the challenge is to project it onto a two-dimensional plane in a way that structure and
meaning are conveyed to the spectator. As edge length is arbitrary, there are in fact no syntactic
restrictions for node placement.
2. The experiment was deployed as an online test. To ensure a presaccadic presentation time, stimulus
presentation including the following mask was embedded in a video that was played back using
HTML5 (with MP4 and webM files to maximize compatibility). To be sure that the timing was
accurate, we conducted an extra timing study where we generated black-white-black videos with a
100ms whitescreen using the same algorithms that were used for the stimulus videos. The actual
whitescreen duration was measured with a photodiode and an oscilloscope for a standard Android
phone, and with a standard desktop PC running Windows 10 for both IE11 and Mozilla Firefox (for
each device, we measured the MP4 as well as the webM video playing on the website), and an older
netbook running Win XP (here: webM only as no MP4 codec was available). All measurements
indicated presentation times of 100 ms Æ 5 ms.
