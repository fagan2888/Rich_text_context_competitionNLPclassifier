ABSTRACT
IF (intermediate filament) proteins can be cleaved by caspases
to generate proapoptotic fragments as shown for desmin.
Thesefragmentscanalsocausefilamentaggregation.Thehy-
pothesis is that disease-causing mutations in IF proteins and
their subsequent characteristic histopathological aggregates
could involve caspases. GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein),
a closely related IF protein expressed mainly in astrocytes, is
also a putative caspase substrate. Mutations in GFAP cause
AxD (Alexander disease). The overexpression of wild-type or
mutant GFAP promotes cytoplasmic aggregate formation,
with caspase activation and GFAP proteolysis. In this study,
we report that GFAP is cleaved specifically by caspase 6 at
VELD225 in its L12 linker domain in vitro. Caspase cleavage of
GFAP at Asp225 produces two major cleavage products. While
the C-GFAP (C-terminal GFAP) is unable to assemble into fil-
aments, the N-GFAP (N-terminal GFAP) forms filamentous
structures that are variable in width and prone to aggre-
gation. The effect of N-GFAP is dominant, thus affecting
normal filament assembly in a way that promotes filament
aggregation. Transient transfection of N-GFAP into a human
astrocytoma cell line induces the formation of cytoplasmic
aggregates, which also disrupt the endogenous GFAP net-
works. In addition, we generated a neo-epitope antibody that
recognizes caspase-cleaved but not the intact GFAP. Using
this antibody, we demonstrate the presence of the caspase-
generated GFAP fragment in transfected cells expressing a

INTRODUCTION
IFs (intermediate filaments), together with microtubules and
microfilaments, form an interconnected network of the cy-
toskeleton, which gives cells their form, shape and functions.
In humans, at least 70 different IF proteins have been iden-
tified (Hesse et al., 2001), and there is a complex expression
pattern of IF proteins specific for every cell type. This is well
demonstrated in astrocytes, in which GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein), vimentin and nestin are the major IF proteins.
While vimentin and nestin are mainly expressed in imma-
ture astrocytes, GFAP is coexpressed with vimentin in mature
astrocytes (Eliasson et al., 1999).
AxD (Alexander disease) is a primary genetic disorder of
astrocytes that typically affects young children (Messing
et al., 2012). It is caused by missense mutations in the coding
region of GFAP (Brenner et al., 2001). Although this is the
most common form of AxD, milder forms with intermediate

ages of onset also exist. A key histopathological feature of all
forms of AxD is the widespread deposition of inclusion bodies
within astrocytes known as Rosenthal fibers, consisting of
aggregated GFAP, the small stress proteins HSP27 and
B-crystallin (Tomokane et al., 1991; Head et al., 1993; Iwaki
et al., 1993) and likely other unidentified proteins. Whether
Rosenthal fibres per se cause astrocyte dysfunction and
what the precise trigger is for their formation are not clear.
Mouse models created via both transgenic and knock-in
approaches (Messing et al., 1998; Hagemann et al., 2006;
Tanaka et al., 2007) clearly show that simply elevating the
level of wild-type GFAP or expressing mutant GFAP leads
to the formation of Rosenthal fibres. Astrocytes cultured
from these mice exhibit decreased cell proliferation and
increased caspase activity (Cho and Messing, 2009). Similar
observations were made in transfected cell lines, where
the expression of mutant forms of GFAP causes extensive
filament aggregation, with caspase activation and GFAP
cleavage (Chen et al., 2011). These findings are of interest
because they represent some of the first indications of a
direct link between abnormal protein aggregation and GFAP
proteolysis through caspase activation.
Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that specif-
ically cleave target proteins at sites next to aspartic acid
residues (Pop and Salvesen, 2009). Caspase cleavage of sev-
eral IF proteins, including nuclear lamins (Orth et al., 1996;
Rao et al., 1996; Takahashi et al., 1996; Ruchaud et al., 2002),
keratins (Caulin et al., 1997; Ku et al., 1997; Ku and Omary,
2001; Tao et al., 2008), desmin (Chen et al., 2003) and vi-
mentin (Morishima, 1999; Byun et al., 2001; Nakanishi et al.,
2001), leads to the destruction of the nuclear envelope and
the disassembly of the cytoplasmic IF network that character-
ize apoptosis. Each of these IF proteins is cleaved by caspase 6
at a consensus site in the L12 linker region of the rod domain,
although cleavage by other caspases at additional sites also
occurs (Marceau et al., 2007). Caspase 6 is an executioner
caspase based on its role in cleavage of nuclear structural
proteins (Orth et al., 1996; Hirata et al., 1998) and its require-
ment for activation by upstream initiator caspases (Boatright
and Salvesen, 2003). Apart from its executive role, caspase
6 can also cleave and activate other caspases (Slee et al.,
1999; Cowling and Downward, 2002), such as caspase 3 (All-
sopp et al., 2000; Graham et al., 2010). Although the precise
trigger for the activation of caspase 6 is not clear, emerging
data suggest a role for its activation in neurodegenerative
conditions (Graham et al., 2011). Caspase 3 activation and
GFAP cleavage contribute to the damaged astrocytes in AD
(Alzheimer's disease) brain (Mouser et al., 2006). In addition,
a proteomic approach identified GFAP as a potential sub-
strate of caspase 6 in human primary neurons (Klaiman et al.,
2008). Although GFAP is itself a caspase substrate, caspase-
mediated cleavage of GFAP in astrocytes has not been fully
explored, and the assembly properties of the caspase cleavage
products have not previously been addressed.
Here, we report that GFAP is specifically cleaved by cas-
pase 6 in vitro. Mutagenesis analysis coupled with an in vitro
caspase cleavage assay confirmed that VELD225 in the L12
linker domain of GFAP is the major caspase cleavage site.
Caspase cleavage of GFAP produces an N-terminal cleavage
product (N-GFAP) that significantly perturbs in vitro filament
assembly and affects normal filament assembly in a way that
promotes inter-filament interactions. In addition, transient
transfection studies demonstrate that the overexpression of
N-GFAP induces the formation of GFAP aggregates that also
disrupt the endogenous networks of intact GFAP in trans-
fected human astrocytoma cells. Furthermore, a neo-epitope
antiserum specific to N-GFAP reveals the presence of the
caspase-cleaved GFAP fragment in cells expressing disease-
causing mutant GFAP and in two types of AxD models that
have previously been shown to have varying levels of GFAP
accumulation in different regions of the CNS (central ner-
vous system) (Messing et al., 1998; Hagemann et al., 2006).
These results imply that caspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP
correlates with elevated GFAP in the context of GFAP mu-
tation and accumulation. Moreover, we provide evidence to
suggest that caspase cleavage of GFAP has important func-
tional consequences, decreasing GFAP filament solubility by
changing filament­filament interactions in a way that pro-
motes aggregation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plasmid construction and site-directed
mutagenesis
Mutant GFAP constructs with specifically altered amino
acids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with
full-length human GFAP (GenBank accession no. J04569) in
the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) as a template (Perng et al.,
2006). All newly generated DNA constructs were verified
by sequencing before use. To generate the amino-terminal
caspase-cleavage product (amino acids 1­225, designated
N-GFAP), a translational stop codon right after the glutamic
acid of the VELD225 sequence was introduced by site-directed
mutagenesis with 5 -GTGGAGCTTGACTAGGCCAAGCCAG-3
and 5 - CTGGCTTGGCCTAGTCAAGCTCCAC-3 as forward
and reverse primers, respectively. The C-terminal frag-
ment of GFAP (amino acids 226­432, designated C-GFAP
(C-terminal GFAP)) was PCR-amplified from the human
GFAP cDNA using the following oligonucleotides: 5 -CATAT-
GGCCAAGCCAGACCTCACCGC-3 and 5 -GAATTCTCACA-
TCACATCCTTGTGC-3 . The amplified PCR product containing
C-GFAP was cloned into the pJET cloning vector (Thermo
Scientific), and the sequence was confirmed by DNA
sequencing. The Myc epitope was added to the N-terminal
end of human GFAP by site-directed mutagenesis using the
oligonucleotide GAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTG.

GFAP proteolysis in Alexander disease models
its variants were subcloned into the pET23b vector (EMD
Millipore) with use of the NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites.
Expression and purification of recombinant
GFAPs
For bacterial expression of proteins, pET23b vector con-
taining cDNAs of either intact GFAP or its variants were
transformed into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS strain
(EMD Millipore). Overexpressed GFAP formed inclusion bod-
ies, which were prepared as described previously (Perng et al.,
2006). The expressed proteins were further purified by ion-
exchange chromatography using an AKTAprime plus system
(GE Healthcare) equipped with a DEAE Sepharose column (GE
Healthcare). Column fractions were analyzed by SDS/PAGE
followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and those containing
purified proteins were collected and stored at - 80C. Pro-
tein concentrations were determined by BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo Scientific) with use of BSA as standard. Recom-
binant mouse GFAP (Ralton et al., 1994) and human vimentin
(Perng et al., 2004) were purified as described previously.
Caspase cleavage of GFAP in vitro
Purified human recombinant GFAP (1 g) was diluted in cas-
pase assay buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1%
(w/v) CHAPS, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT (dithiothreitol) and
5% (v/v) glycerol) in the absence or presence of active re-
combinant human caspase 3 or caspase 6 (BioVision) at a final
concentration of 0.25 U/l. After incubation for 1 h at 37C,
the cleavage products were separated by SDS/PAGE, followed
by Coomassie Blue staining or immunoblotting. To determine
the caspase cleavage site in GFAP, caspase-cleaved GFAP was
separated by SDS/PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane
(EMD Millipore), stained with Coomassie Blue and then sub-
jected directly to N-terminal sequencing (Mission Biotech).
To determine whether the D225E mutant GFAP was resis-
tant to caspase cleavage in vitro, purified mutant GFAP was
incubated with recombinant active caspase 6 and analyzed
as above. The proteolytic activities of caspase 3 and caspase
6 were confirmed using a structurally related IF protein, vi-
mentin (Byun et al., 2001), as a positive control.
In vitro assembly and sedimentation assay
Purified GFAP was diluted to 0.3 mg/ml in 6 M urea in a
buffer of 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA and
1 mM DTT. Protein samples were dialyzed stepwise against
the same buffer containing 3 M urea for 6 h and then
against the same buffer without urea at 4C overnight. Fila-
ment assembly was completed by dialyzing against assembly
buffer (10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.0 and 50 mM NaCl) for 12­
16 h at room temperature. The filament-forming efficiency
was assessed by high-speed sedimentation assay as described
previously (Nicholl and Quinlan, 1994). In brief, the assembly
mixture was layered onto a cushion of 0.85 M sucrose in the
final assembly buffer and centrifuged for 30 min at 80000 g
at 20C in a Hitachi S55S rotor using a CS150NX table-
top micro-ultracentrifuge (Hitachi Koki Co.). To investigate
the extent of filament­filament interactions in the whole
filament population, samples were subjected to low-speed
centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min at room temperature in a
benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf). The supernatant and pellet
dissolved in Laemmli's sample buffer (Laemmli, 1970) in vol-
umes proportional to the original sample size were analyzed
by SDS/PAGE and were visualized by Coomassie Blue stain-
ing. In some instances, the proportions of GFAP distributed
between pellet and supernatant fractions were measured
using an image analyzer (ImageQuant 350, GE Healthcare).
Coomassie Blue signals for individual bands were quantified
using the image analysis software (ImageQuant TL 7.0, GE
Healthcare).
Electron microscopy
GFAP was diluted in assembly buffer to 0.1 mg/ml and
was negatively stained with 1% (w/v) uranyl acetate (Elec-
tron Microscopy Sciences). Samples were spread on carbon-
coated copper grids (Ted Pella Inc.) and examined with
an HT7700 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi High-
Technologies) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. Images
were acquired using a CCD (charge-coupled-device) camera
before being further processed in Adobe Photoshop CS II
(Adobe Systems). Filament length and diameter were mea-
sured on enlarged electron micrographs using ImageJ soft-
ware (National Institutes of Health).
Cell cultures, transfection and treatments
Human breast cancer epithelial MCF7 cells were obtained
from the European Collections of Cell Cultures (Sigma-
Aldrich). Human astrocytoma U343MG cells were provided
by Dr. J. T. Rutka (Division of Neurosurgery, University of
Toronto, Toronto, Canada) and were grown essentially as de-
scribed (Perng et al., 2006). For transient transfection studies,
plasmid DNA was prepared using a PureLinkTM HiPure Midi-
Prep kit (Invitrogen). Cells on 13 mm coverslips at a density
of 40­50% confluency were transfected using GeneJuice®
transfection reagent (EMD Millipore) according to the man-
ufacturer's instructions. Cells were allowed to recover for
48 h before further processing for immunofluorescence mi-
croscopy. In some experiments, transfected cells were treated
with apoptosis-inducing drug OA (okadaic acid; Enzo Life Sci-
ences) at a final concentration of 200 nM for 2­4 h or the
general caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (Promega) at a final con-
centration of 40 M.
Generation of caspase cleavage site-directed
antibody
An immunogen peptide, ARQQVHVELD225, corresponding
to amino acids 216­225 of human GFAP, was synthe-
sized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used for

immunization (Yao-Hong Biotechnology Inc.). The rabbit
serum providing the highest titer and specificity was sub-
sequently used. The caspase cleavage site-specific antibody
was further purified from rabbit serum by affinity chro-
matography. Briefly, CnBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (GE
Healthcare) were resuspended in 1 mM HCl for 30 min. Af-
ter being washed twice with coupling buffer (0.1 M sodium
carbonate, pH 8.3), swelled beads were mixed with 10 mg im-
munogen peptide and rotated at 4C for approximately 16 h.
The beads were washed with coupling buffer and blocked in
1 M glycine, pH 8 for 2 h at 4C. Rabbit antiserum was then
loaded onto the peptide column, from which the antigen-
specific antibody was eluted with 0.1 M glycine (pH 2.5) into
tubes containing 1 M Tris/HCl (pH 9.3). Fractions were an-
alyzed by SDS/PAGE, and those containing antibodies were
collected and tested for their specificity by immunoblotting
and immunofluorescence microscopy.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells grown to about 80% confluency on glass coverslips
were processed for indirect immunofluorescence microscopy
essentially as described (Perng et al., 2006). The primary anti-
bodies used in this study were mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP
antibodies GA-5 (1:500, Sigma-Aldrich) and SMI-21 (1:500,
Covance) and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFAP (DakoCytomation)
and anti-active caspase 6 (BioVision) antibodies. Primary an-
tibodies were detected using Alexa Fluor® 488 (1:600)- or
Alexa Fluor® 594 (1:600)-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Invitrogen). The glass coverslips were mounted on slides and
observed using a Zeiss LSM510 laser scanning microscope
using a ×40 Plan-Neofluar objective (NA 0.75) (Carl Zeiss).
Images were collected in multi-track mode by LSM510 soft-
ware taking 1.0 m optical sections and processed for figures
using Adobe® Photoshop CS II (Adobe System).
Cell fractionation, immunoblotting and
immunoprecipitation
Cells grown on 10-cm2 Petri dishes were transfected with
control vector (pcDNA3.1) or the same vector encoding the
indicated GFAP variants. At 48 h after transfection, cells were
lysed using harsh extraction buffer [10 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6,
140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton
X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS]
supplemented with 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mM PMSF containing 250 U/ml ben-
zonase nuclease (EMD Millipore) as described previously
(Perng et al., 2006). Cell lysates were then homogenized in
a 1 ml Dounce homogenizer (Wheaton). After protein con-
centration determination, total cell lysates were equalized
by adding appropriate volumes of Laemmli's sample buffer
(Laemmli, 1970) before analyzing by SDS/PAGE and im-
munoblotting. To prepare supernatant and pellet fractions,
total cell lysates were centrifuged at 16000 g for 10 min at
4C in a benchtop centrifuge (Eppendorf). The resulting pel-
lets were resuspended in Laemmli's sample buffer in a volume
that was equivalent to the supernatant.
Immunoblotting was performed using the semidry blot-
ting method according to the manufacturer's specifica-
tions (Bio-Rad) and modified as described (Perng et al.,
2006). Primary antibodies used were monoclonal anti-GFAP
GA-5 (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich) and SMI-21 (1:5000, Cov-
ance), anti-Myc (9E10, 1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-vimentin
(1:5000, V9, Sigma-Aldrich), anti-caspase 3 (1:1000, Cell Sig-
naling Technology) and anti-actin (1:5000, AC-40, Sigma-
Aldrich) antibodies. Primary antibodies were detected by
HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibod-
ies (DakoCytomation) diluted by 1:5000 in blocking buffer
containing 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS (Tris-buffered saline), fol-
lowed by washing with TBS for a total of 30 min with
several changes. Antibody labeling was detected by ECL
(enhanced chemiluminescence; Western Lightning Plus-ECL,
PerkinElmer) using a luminescent image analyzer (Image-
Quant 350, GE Healthcare). The strength of signals was quan-
tified using the image analysis software (ImageQuant TL 7.0,
GE Healthcare).
For immunoprecipitation, insoluble proteins in the pel-
let fraction were first solubilized in 10 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8
and 1 mM EDTA containing 1% (w/v) SDS and then diluted
1:10 in harsh extraction buffer without SDS. The resulting so-
lution was precleared by incubating with a 50% (v/v) slurry of
protein A Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4C. The pre-
cleared sample was then incubated with the GFAP fragment-
specific D225 antibody for 1 h at 4C, followed by the cap-
ture of immunocomplexes by protein A-Sepharose beads at
4C overnight. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times
with harsh extraction buffer, resuspended in Laemmli's sam-
ple buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting.
Animal use and ethics statement
Knock-in mice carrying the R236H mutation in mouse Gfap
(Hagemann et al., 2006) and transgenic mice (GFAPTg) ex-
pressing added copies of a human GFAP transgene (Messing
et al., 1998) were generated as described previously. GFAP
knock-in mice (GFAP+ /R236H) were maintained as heterozy-
gotes in the 129S6 background and GFAP transgenic mice
(GFAPTg) were maintained as hemizygotes in the FVB/N back-
ground. All experiments involving animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
Graduate School at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Analyses of GFAP expression and proteolysis in
mouse models of AxD
For total protein preparation, brain samples were homog-
enized in SDS lysis buffer (50 mM, Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM
EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 1 mM Pefabloc SC (Sigma-Aldrich) and
CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied

Science) using a Geno/Grinder tissue homogenizer (SPEX
CertiPrep). After homogenization, samples were boiled for
15 min and then diluted in PBS. Protein concentration was
determined using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Thermo Scien-
tific) with BSA as a standard. To prepare soluble and insolu-
ble fractions, brain tissues were first homogenized in deoxy-
cholate lysis buffer (20 mM, Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
1 mM EDTA, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.5% (w/v) sodium de-
oxycholate, 1 mM Pefabloc SC and CompleteTM Mini protease
inhibitor mixture), followed by centrifugation at 16000 g for
20 min at 4C. The supernatant was collected as the solu-
ble fraction, and the remaining pellet, representing the in-
soluble fraction, was resuspended in urea buffer (7 M urea,
50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Pe-
fabloc SC and CompleteTM Mini protease inhibitor mixture).
After the protein concentration determination, protein sam-
ples were electrophoresed on 10% (w/v) CriterionTM Pre-
cast Gels (Bio-Rad), followed by transfer to Immobilon-FL
membranes (EMD Millipore). The membranes were incubated
with mouse monoclonal anti-GFAP GA-5 (1:10,000, Sigma-
Aldrich) and rabbit polyclonal caspase cleavage site-specific
D225 antibodies (1:5,000) for 1 h at room temperature. After
being washed with TBST (TBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween
20), membranes were incubated for 2 h with IRDye 680- or
800-conjugated secondary antibody (LI-COR Biosciences) di-
luted by 1:10,000 in TBST. Immunoblots were analyzed with
an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences),
and the signal intensity of proteins of interest was quanti-
fied using the Image Studio software (Ver. 2.0, LI-COR Bio-
sciences). Equal loading of each fraction was verified using a
polyclonal anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase) antibody (Abcam).
ELISA for GFAP
For quantification of GFAP, a sandwich ELISA was carried
out as described previously (Hagemann et al., 2009; Hage-
mann et al., 2012) using the monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody
cocktail SMI-26 (Covance) as capture antibodies and a rabbit
polyclonal anti-GFAP antibody (DakoCytomation) as a de-
tecting antibody.
RESULTS
Specific cleavage of GFAP at Asp225 by caspase 6
in vitro
Upon incubation of recombinant human GFAP with caspase
6, we found that GFAP can be cleaved to generate two major
degradation products of about 26 and about 24 kDa, re-
spectively (Figure 1A, lane 2, indicated as p26 and p24). Im-
munoblotting analysis with two commercially available mon-
oclonal antibodies revealed that SMI21 antibody recognized
the p26 fragment (Figure 1B, lane 1), whilst the GA-5 an-
tibody recognized the p24 fragment (Figure 1B, lane 2). As
the epitope of the GA-5 antibody resides in the tail domain
of GFAP (Chen et al., 2011), this suggested that the p24
fragment may correspond to the C-GFAP. SMI-21 antibody
detected the p26 fragment of N-terminally tagged GFAP
(Myc-GFAP; Figure 1C). Attempts to sequence the amino ter-
minus of N-GFAP by automated Edman degradation were
unsuccessful, likely due to a blocked N-terminus as has been
demonstrated on desmin (Mavroidis et al., 2008). Neverthe-
less, C-GFAP sequencing revealed 226VAKP in the amino ter-
minus of this fragment, suggesting that VELD225 at the car-
boxy end of N-GFAP is the caspase 6 cleavage site. This was
confirmed by substituting aspartate with glutamate (D225E)
in the predicted recognition site. D225E GFAP was not cleaved
by caspase 6 (Figure 1D). These data unambiguously demon-
strate that GFAP is cleaved specifically by caspase 6 at Asp225
in its L12 linker domain in vitro (Figure 1E).
Assembly properties of the caspase-generated
cleavage products
We were then interested to know the assembly properties of
N-GFAP and C-GFAP. Like other type III IF proteins, in vitro
assembly of GFAP goes through several distinct and well-
characterized stages (Herrmann and Aebi, 2004). The first
stage is the formation of the ULFs (unit length filaments),
which anneal end to end longitudinally and then compact
radially to form the mature filament that is 10 nm wide
and many microns long. Under standard assembly condi-
tions, wild-type GFAP formed typical 10 nm filaments that
were many microns in length (Figure 2A). N-GFAP formed
large aggregates (Figure 2B), which at higher magnification
could be seen to contain irregular filamentous structures
(Figure 2B, inset). C-GFAP failed to self-assemble into fila-
ments but instead formed discrete particles approximately
12­20 nm in diameter (Figure 2C).
The impact of both fragments upon the assembly of
intact wild-type GFAP was also assessed. N-GFAP af-
fected the assembly in a concentration dependent man-
ner (Figure 2D), whereas C-GFAP did not apparently
change the assembly or filament morphology of intact
GFAP (Figure 2E). 10% N-GFAP with 90% intact GFAP
did not dramatically alter the morphology of the as-
sembled filaments (Supplementary Figure S1 available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e125add.htm) com-
pared with those made from 100% intact GFAP (Figure 2A).
Increasing the proportion of N-GFAP to 25% produced fil-
aments that had a strong tendency to associate laterally
(Figure 2D and inset). These data suggest that N-GFAP may
integrate into GFAP filaments, but at the expense of pro-
moting filament­filament interactions. Therefore, we per-
formed a low-speed sedimentation assay to assess the ex-
tent of filament­filament interactions in the whole filament

(A) Purified recombinant human GFAP was either untreated (lane 1) or treated with 2.5 U of active caspase 6 (lane 2) for 1 h at 37C. The
reaction products were separated by SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. (B) GFAP cleaved by active caspase 6 generated
two prominent proteolytic fragments, p26 and p24 (A, lane 2), which were recognized by the anti-GFAP antibodies SMI-21 (lane 1) and
GA-5 (lane 2), antibodies, respectively. Both antibodies also recognized intact GFAP (lanes 1 and 2). (C) Caspase cleavage of Myc-GFAP
generated a proteolytic fragment that was recognized by both the anti-GFAP SMI-21 (lane 2) and anti-Myc (lane 4) antibodies. (D) The
D225E mutant GFAP was resistant to caspase 6 cleavage (lane 2), whereas caspase cleavage of wild-type GFAP generated appropriately

linker sequences (denoted by black bars). p26 and p24 represent the major caspase-cleaved GFAP fragments that migrate on SDS/PAGE
with apparent molecular masses of 26 and 24 kDa, respectively. The single-letter amino acid codes for the caspase cleavage site are

supernatant fraction (Figure 2F, lane 1) and it had as-
sembled efficiently (Supplementary Figure S2 available
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e125add.htm). In-
cluding 25% N-GFAP in the assembly of intact GFAP (Fig-
ure 2F, lane 8, labeled P) produced a dramatic change in
the sedimentation behavior of the intact GFAP. The N-GFAP
mostly pelleted when assembled on its own (Figure 2F, lane
4), whilst C-GFAP remained mostly (90%) in the supernatant
fraction (Figure 2F, lane 5). Indeed coassembly of C-GFAP
with intact GFAP, even at a 50%:50% ratio (Figure 2F, lane
10) did not change the sedimentation characteristics of the
assembled material. These data support the suggestion that
the integration of N-GFAP into GFAP filaments resulted in
increased filament­filament interactions.
Generation and characterization of site-directed
caspase cleavage antibody
Using an immunogen peptide containing the exposed VELD225
sequence, we generated a neo-epitope antibody, D225 that
specifically recognized N-GFAP but not C-GFAP or intact
GFAP (Figure 3A, cf. lanes 1 and 2). The specificity of this
antibody was further confirmed by immunoblotting puri-
fied recombinant proteins. The D225 antibody recognized

Figure 2 Assembly properties of the caspase-cleaved GFAP fragments
Purified N-, C- and intact GFAP at a concentration of 0.3 mg/ml were assembled in vitro. The assembly products were negatively stained
and visualized by electron microscopy. Intact GFAP assembled into typical 10-nm filaments (A), whereas N-GFAP formed irregular
filamentous structures (B, inset) that had a strong tendency to aggregate (B). C-GFAP failed to assemble into extended filaments but
instead formed discrete particles (C). When C-GFAP was coassembled with intact GFAP, the filaments formed were not dramatically
altered in morphology (E) compared with those made from intact GFAP alone (A). In contrast, mixing N-GFAP in a 25%:75% ratio with
intact GFAP resulted in the formation of filaments (D, inset) that had a strong tendency to aggregate (D). Bar, 200 nm, except in panels B
and D, where the bars are 1 m and 0.5 m, respectively. The extent of filament aggregation was assessed by a low-speed sedimentation
assay (F). Intact, N- and C-GFAP were assembled either alone or in combinations of intact GFAP with either N-GFAP or C-GFAP at a
75%:25% ratio. Assembly products were subjected to low-speed centrifugation, and the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were
analyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Most of the assembled intact GFAP remained in the supernatant fraction
(lane 1), whereas N-GFAP was found mainly in the pellet fraction (lane 4). Coassembly of N-GFAP with full-length protein resulted in
formation of assembly complexes that were easily sedimented into the pellet fraction (lane 8). In contrast, C-GFAP, either on its own

reflecting sequence differences observed for full-length pro-
teins (DeArmond et al., 1986). These data indicate epitope-
sharing between VEMD and VELD by the D255 polyclonal
peptide specific antibodies and confirm the VEXD consensus
motif as the major caspase 6 cleavage site (Talanian et al.,
1997; Nicholson, 1999).
The D225 antibody was capable of recognizing N-
GFAP in MCF-7 cells as well as in the astrocyte cell
line U343MG that has well-established GFAP networks
(Supplementary Figure S3 available at http://www.
asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e125add.htm). Intact GFAP
formed filaments and peripheral bundles that were read-
ily stained in transiently transfected MCF7 cells by the
commercial antibody SMI-21 (Figure 4A, arrows) but not
by the D225 antibody (Figure 4B). When N-GFAP was
transiently transfected alone, it formed aggregates that
were easily stained by the D225 antibody (Figure 4E, arrows).
Blotting data confirmed these immunofluorescence results
(Figure 4G).
U343MG cells treated for 4 h with 200 nM OA exhibited
many morphological features of apoptosis including cellular
rounding, cytosolic shrinkage as well as nuclear condensa-
tion and fragmentation (Figure 5C). Associated with these
morphological changes were activation of caspase 3 and the
cleavage of a well-characterized caspase 3 substrate PARP
(poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase) into its characteristically sized
cleavage products (Supplementary Figure S4 available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e125add.htm). This
treatment also caused the collapse of the GFAP networks
into filament bundles (Figure 5A­C, arrows) and perinuclear
aggregates (Figure 5A­C, arrowheads). These structures were

prepared from OA-treated cells showed that the D225 anti-
body specifically detected a degradation product of about
26 kDa (Figure 5D, lane 2), suggesting caspase-mediated
breakdown of GFAP in cells after exposure to apoptotic stim-
uli. These data confirm the specificity of the D225 antibody
and illustrate its usefulness to detect specifically the caspase-
mediated cleavage of GFAP at both the biochemical and cel-
lular levels.
Caspase sensitivity of AxD causing GFAP mutants
U343MG cells were transiently transfected with R239H GFAP,
one of the most common mutations associated with AxD.
This induced GFAP-containing aggregates that were read-
ily stained by the D225 antibody, suggesting that N-GFAP
might be one of the components of GFAP-rich aggregates
(Figures 6A­6C). We also examined the activation status of
caspase 6 and found active caspase 6 localized at sites of GFAP
aggregation (Figure 6, D­F). Immunoblotting of cell extracts
from R239H-transfected cells detected a cleavage product
similar in size to N-GFAP in the pellet fraction (Figure 6G,
lane 4). The D225 antibody was able to immunoprecipitate
N-GFAP from a solubilized pellet fraction (Figure 6H). Ad-
dition of a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk to
cells transiently transfected with R239H GFAP reduced the
abundance of the N-GFAP fragment (Figure 6I). These data
suggest that R239H GFAP is susceptible to caspase cleavage
in transiently transfected U343MG cells.
Analysis of GFAP expression and degradation in
mouse models of AxD
Total protein lysates were prepared from different regions of
the CNS, including olfactory bulb, hippocampus and spinal
cord from both wild-type (GFAP+ / + ) and GFAP+ /R236H mice
(Hagemann et al., 2006) with mutation corresponding to the
R239H mutation found in human AxD. Immunoblotting anal-
yses using GA-5 and D225 antibodies showed that the N-
GFAP was detected only in olfactory bulb (Figure 7A, lane 2)
and hippocampus (Figure 7B, lane 2) of GFAP+ /R236H mice but
not wild-type controls (Figure 7A and B, lane 1,). In the spinal
cord, however, the N-GFAP was detected in both wild-type
and GFAP+ /R236H mice (Figure 7C, lanes 1and 2). When the
tissue samples were fractionated into pellet and supernatant
fractions, then N-GFAP was detected exclusively in the in-
soluble fractions of both the wild-type (Figure 7C, lane 5)
and the GFAP+ /R236H (Figure 7A­C, lane 6) mice by the D225
antibody. These data confirm that the expression of GFAP
varies considerably between different regions of the CNS
(Jany et al., 2013). Importantly, they also suggest that the
expression of R236H GFAP increases the caspase-mediated
cleavage of GFAP.
Similar analyses of transgenic mice (GFAPTg) that consti-
tutively overexpress human wild-type GFAP (Messing et al.,
1998) revealed that caspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP was
a feature of this model too. The presence of the caspase-
produced N-GFAP was confirmed by immunoblotting anal-
yses (Figure 8A). GFAP levels in GFAPTg mice were increased
markedly with both the full length and GFAP degradation
products being detected (Figure 8A, lane 2). Using GA-5 an-
tibody, this marked increase in GFAP in both soluble and
insoluble fractions of GFAPTg mice (Figure 8A, lanes 4 and
6) compared with wild-type controls (Figure 8A, lanes 3 and
5) was confirmed. The D225 antibody detected N-GFAP in
samples from GFAPTg mice (Figure 8A, lane 2), but not from
wild-type controls (Figure 8A, lane 1). As with the cell-based
studies, N-GFAP was detected mainly in the insoluble fraction
(Figure 8A, lane 6) consistent with its segregation into cyto-
plasmic aggregates. Quantitative ELISA (Figure 8B) revealed
that GFAP protein levels were increased 72-fold in total brain
lysates, 73.6-fold in the soluble fraction and 18.7-fold in the
insoluble fraction of GFAPTg mice compared with wild-type

GFAP was visualized by double-label immunofluorescence microscopy using the SMI-21 (A and D, green channel) and D225 (B and E,
red channel) antibodies. Merged images show the superimposition of the green and red signals, with overlapping areas appearing yellow
(C and F). The nuclei were visualized by DNA staining with DAPI (C and F). When expressed in MCF7 cells, intact GFAP mainly formed
extended filaments with some peripheral accumulations that were stained by the SMI-21 antibody (A, arrows) but not the D225 antibody
(B). Transfecting N-GFAP into this cell line resulted in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates that were stained by both the SMI-21 (D,
arrows) and D225 antibodies (E, arrows). Occasionally, N-GFAP formed small clumps superimposed upon a diffused cytoplasmic staining
pattern (D and E, arrowhead). Bar, 10 m. (G) Total cell lysates prepared from untransfected cells (lanes 1 and 4) and cells transfected

relates with elevated GFAP in this mouse model of AxD.
Potential functional consequence of caspase
cleavage of GFAP
To examine the functional consequence of caspase-mediated
GFAP proteolysis at VELD225, MCF7 cells were transiently
transfected with either wild-type GFAP or caspase cleavage-
resistant D225E mutant. MCF7 cells were selected because
they lack endogenous GFAP and caspase 3 (Janicke et al.,
1998), thereby avoiding the potentially confounding influ-
ence of the endogenous caspase cleavage-sensitive GFAP at
additional sites. When transfected into this cell line, wild-
type and D225E GFAP formed filament networks in most
of the transfected cells (results not shown). OA treatment

caused the collapse of both wild-type (Figure 9A) and D225E
(Figure 9C) GFAP filaments, but generated N-GFAP only in
wild-type GFAP-transfected cells (Figure 9B). Double-label
immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated colocaliza-
tion of the N-GFAP (Figure 9B) with the OA-collapsed GFAP
aggregates (Figure 9A, arrowhead) and filament bundles (Fig-
ure 9A, arrows), indicating that the presence of N-GFAP could
potentially influence GFAP filament properties. To test this
hypothesis, we assessed biochemically the solubility proper-
ties of wild-type and D225E GFAP in transfected MCF7 cells.
Using an extraction buffer containing deoxycholate (Perng
et al., 2006), a significant proportion (50%) of both wild-
type and D225E GFAP could be extracted from transfected
cells (Figure 9D, lanes 1 and 3). After OA treatment, the
solubility of D225E GFAP was not dramatically altered (Fig-
ure 9D, lanes 7 and 8) compared with untreated cells (Fig-
ure 9D, lanes 3 and 4), whereas wild-type GFAP, alone with
its degradation products, was more resistant to extraction
(Figure 9D, lane 6). Taken together, these data suggest that
caspase cleavage of GFAP is a functionally relevant prote-
olytic event that can potentially alter the solubility of GFAP
filament.
DISCUSSION
Caspases play an essential role during apoptotic cell death.
These enzymes define a class of cysteine-aspartic acid
proteases that posttranslationally modify their substrates
through cleavage at a specific aspartic acid residue. Although
caspase cleavage of several IF proteins, including the nu-
clear lamins, keratins, vimentin and desmin (Marceau et al.,
2007), has been well documented, relatively few studies on
caspase-mediated proteolysis of GFAP have been reported.
Evidence for the proteolytic cleavage of GFAP by caspase
6 was provided by a recent study in human primary neu-
rons (Klaiman et al., 2008), where a simple proteomic ap-
proach identified three potential caspase 6 cleavage sites in
GFAP: VERD142, QEAD177 and VELD225. However, the direct
cleavage of GFAP at these sites has not been confirmed. In
this study, we performed an in-depth characterization of
caspase-mediated cleavage of GFAP via the use of a caspase
cleavage site-specific antibody, which we characterized and
validated. We show here that GFAP is cleaved selectively by
caspase 6 at a conserved Asp225 residue in its L12 linker do-
main in vitro. Caspase cleavage of GFAP at this site generated
an N-terminal fragment that dramatically alters filament as-
sembly both in vitro and in transfected cells, and does so in
a dominant manner. The truncated protein can also disturb
endogenous network of intact GFAP. In addition, we demon-
strate the presence of N-GFAP in transfected cells expressing
AxD-causing mutants and in two types of AxD models carry-
ing either mutant GFAP or overexpressing human wild-type
GFAP, suggesting that GFAP mutation and elevated expres-
sion correlate with caspase-mediated GFAP proteolysis. Fi-
nally, we provide evidence to show that caspase cleavage of
GFAP has a functional impact on GFAP filament properties.
Our data differ from those reported by Mouser et al.,
2006, who used a site-directed antibody to caspase-cleaved
GFAP to demonstrate that GFAP is cleaved at DLTD266, a
unique caspase cleavage site that is found only in GFAP
and not in other IF proteins. A caspase cleavage product-
specific antibody strongly stained degenerating astrocytes
in AD brain and colocalized with an antibody specific to
active caspase 3, providing evidence that the caspase-
mediated cleavage of GFAP; activation of apoptotic path-
ways, and degeneration of astrocytes might be linked. In
our in vitro cleavage assay, however, GFAP was resistant
to caspase 3 cleavage (Supplementary Figure S6 available
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/005/an005e125add.htm) de-
spite efficient cleavage by caspase 6. The inefficient cleavage
of GFAP by caspase 3 may be explained by the fact that
DLTD266 is part of a heptad repeat in the -helical 2B sub-
domain, which is buried within the coiled-coil dimer making
it inaccessible for cleavage. Another possible explanation is
that our use of active caspase 3 utilized a concentration
that was insufficient for in vitro activity. This is supported
by the previous findings that caspase 6 can cleave its sub-
strates at low doses, whereas caspase 3 is able to generate the

et al., 1997; Schutte et al., 2004).
GFAP breakdown products could result from post mortem
or in vitro degradation of the protein (DeArmond et al., 1983).
GFAP is susceptible to cleavage by calcium-dependent pro-
teases such as calpain (Lee et al., 2000), producing a range
of breakdown products between 38 and 50 kDa (Zoltewicz
et al., 2012). However, our data are not compatible with
the possibility that the GFAP degradation products resulted
from calpain-mediated digestion, as we took deliberate steps
to avoid in vitro degradation by the activation of proteases
during the sample preparation process. Indeed, we found
that a 26 kDa proteolytic fragment was invariably produced

in U343MG cells (Chen et al., 2011), but it was not detected in
the untransfected cells that contained abundant endogenous
GFAP. In addition to caspase and calpain, ubiquitin protea-
some system is also involved in the proteolysis of GFAP, which
regulates the turnover of the glial filaments (Tang et al., 2006;
Tang et al., 2010). The signals, if any, that target GFAP for
different degradation pathways and the significance of these
proteolytic events have yet to be determined. Understand-
ing the significance and regulation of GFAP proteolysis is
important from a cell-biological standpoint and may also
have pathophysiological relevance to degenerative disorders
in which cytoskeletal defects result from GFAP proteolysis.
Structural consequences of caspase-mediated
GFAP proteolysis
Like other IF family members, GFAP has a characteristic tri-
partite domain structure consisting of a central -helical rod
domain flanked by non-helical head and tail domains. While
the head domain of GFAP is essential for normal filament
assembly (Quinlan et al., 1989), the tail domain plays an
important role in controlling filament width in vitro (Quin-
lan et al., 1989; Ralton et al., 1994) as well as in establishing
proper IF networks in vivo (Chen and Liem, 1994). Our in vitro
studies demonstrate that C-GFAP lacking the head and coil
1 domains completely abolished its filament-forming abil-
ity, producing soluble complexes that remained in a discrete
oligomeric state under all conditions tested. In contrast, N-
GFAP missing the coil 2 and tail domains formed structures
that were irregular in diameter and aggregation prone. These
data suggest that while the N-terminal half of GFAP is essen-
tial for filament elongation, the C-terminal half is involved
in controlling filament width and inter-filament interactions.
Previous studies on type III IF proteins proposed that the C-
terminal tail domain associates intramolecularly with the C-
terminal end of the rod domain (Kouklis et al., 1991), which
form a surface-exposed loop structure that prevents inap-
propriate subunit interactions in the assembly process and
regulates filament thickness. This offers an explanation of the
altered width of filaments assembled from truncated forms
of vimentin (Herrmann et al., 1996; Herrmann et al., 2000)
and the changed in vitro assembly characteristics of N-GFAP
we report here.
This study parallels recent studies on a similarly truncated
desmin, which contains the first 264 amino acids of desmin
(N-desmin). Both N-GFAP and N-desmin have a strong ten-
dency to aggregate in vitro (Bar et al., 2009) and in trans-
fected cells (Chen et al., 2003), and both appear to func-
tion as potent disruptors of IF assembly. These findings are

consistent with the observations that a similar N-terminal
vimentin fragment comprising the head and conserved 1A
domains interferes with normal filament assembly in a
dominant-negative fashion (Kural et al., 2007; Chang et al.,
2009).
Functional consequences of caspase-mediated
GFAP proteolysis
IFs fulfill dual roles in apoptosis by modulating events
upstream of caspase activation, providing resistance
to apoptosis initiation and by enhancing downstream
caspase-mediated proteolysis to facilitate the execution of
cell death (Marceau et al., 2007). Although several IF proteins,
including keratin (Yoneda et al., 2004) and nestin (Sahlgren
et al., 2006), exhibit anti-apoptotic properties, caspase cleav-
age of IF proteins could also generate pro-apoptotic frag-
ments that amplify cell death signals (Byun et al., 2001).
Our data show that caspase cleavage of GFAP generated two
major proteolytic fragments, but neither of these fragments
significantly induced apoptotic cell death when transiently
overexpressed in either MCF7 or U343MG cells. These findings
are in agreement with those of Chen et al., 2003, who demon-
strated that cultured myoblasts transiently transfected with
a similarly truncated desmin encoding amino acids 1­263
were still viable at 72 h, despite the presence of extensive
aggregates. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that
the presence of caspase cleavage products sensitizes cells to
the induction of apoptosis by oxidative stress (Cho and Mess-
ing, 2009) or other apoptotic stimuli (Tang et al., 2006), our
results argue against a direct pro-apoptotic function for ei-
ther GFAP cleavage product. The general question that then
confronts us is how caspase cleavage could influence the
functional properties of GFAP filaments.
Our cellular models show that wild-type GFAP is more
resistant to extraction compared with non-cleavable D225E
mutant in OA-stressed MCF7 cells. The resistance of wild-
type GFAP to extraction is likely due to the altered filament
properties induced by the presence of caspase-cleaved GFAP
fragment. In vitro studies provide additional evidence to sup-
port the role of caspase-produced GFAP fragment in promot-
ing aggregate formation. These combined data suggest that
caspase cleavage of GFAP has important functional conse-
quences, decreasing GFAP solubility by changing filament-
filament interactions in a manner that encourages aggrega-
tion. There are several other ways to modulate GFAP filament
functional properties in astrocytes. They include phosphory-
lation (Sihag et al., 2007), the association of IF-associated
proteins such as B-crystallin (Koyama and Goldman, 1999;
Perng et al., 1999), and the incorporation of other IF proteins,
such as vimentin and nestin (Herrmann and Aebi, 2000). The
proteolytic GFAP fragment produced on caspase cleavage
provides a complementary mechanism that could potentially
alter GFAP filament organization and filament properties in
astrocytes.

Figure S2 High-speed sedimentation assay confirmed that GFAP
assembled efficiently
Intact, N- and C-GFAP were assembled either alone or in combinations with
intact GFAP at a 75:25 ratio. Assembly products were subjected to high-speed
sedimentation assay and the supernatant (S) and pellet (P) fractions were
analyzed by SDS-/PAGE, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. A representative
gel is shown, and the positions of N-, C- and intact GFAP are indicated.
Molecular mass markers (in kDa) are labeled adjacent to lane 1. Under these
assay conditions, most (>90%) of the assembled intact GFAP was found in the
pellet fraction (lane 2), confirming that intact GFAP had assembled efficiently.
N-GFAP was also detected in the pellet fraction (lane 4). When coassembed
with intact GFAP, N-GFAP was found exclusively in the pellet fraction (lane
8). In contrast, C-GFAP, either on its own (lane 5) or in combination with
intact GFAP (lane 9), remained soluble and its presence did not affect the
sedimentation behavior of intact GFAP (lane 10).

Figure S3 Transient expression of N-GFAP resulted in the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates in human astrocytoma U343MG cells
U343MG cells were either untransfected (A-­C) or transfected with N-GFAP (D ­ F). At 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed and
processed for double-label immunofluorescence microscopy using SMI-21 (A and D, green channel) and D225 (B and E, red channel)
antibodies. Merged image shows the region of colocalization appearing yellow (C and F). Notice that while SMI-21 antibody readily
stained endogenous GFAP in untransfected cells (A), no signal was produced by the D225 antibody (B). The D225 antibody strongly
stained cells that were transfected with N-GFAP (E). The staining was apparent both along filament bundles (E, arrowheads) and in
GFAP-rich aggregates (E, arrows) and largely colocalized with staining of total GFAP (D). Bar, 10 m.
Figure S4 Activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of PARP in OA treated
cells
U343MG cells were treated with 200 nM OA or equivalent volume of DMSO
(Con) for 4 h. Total cell lysates prepared from control (A and B, lane 1) or
OA-treated (A and B, lane 2) cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with
antibodies to either caspase 3, including one to detect activated caspase 3
(A) or -PARP (B). Notice that cleaved caspase 3 (A, lane 2) and cleaved PARP
fragment (B, lane 2, arrowhead) were detected in OA-treated cells.
Figure S5 Analysis of protein expression in brains of GFAPTg mice
Total (20 g per lane), soluble (20 g per lane) and insoluble (1.6 g per lane)
fractions prepared from whole brains of wild-type ( + / + , lanes 1, 3 and 5) and
GFAPTg (Tg, lanes 2, 4 and 6) mice were analyzed by SDS-/PAGE and visualized
by Coomassie Blue staining. The relative electrophoretic mobility of molecular
mass markers (in kDa) is indicated adjacent to lane 1. The position of GFAP is
indicated.

GFAP proteolysis in Alexander disease models
Figure S6 GFAP is not cleaved by caspase-3 in vitro
Purified recombinant GFAP (lanes 1 and 2) and vimentin (lanes 3 and 4) were
incubated with buffer alone (lanes 1 and 3) or 2.5 U of purified active caspase-3
(C3, lanes 2 and 4) for 1 h at 37C. The reaction products were analyzed by
immunoblotting using anti-GFAP (SMI-21) and anti-vimentin (V9) antibodies.
Notice that vimentin was cleaved by caspase 3 into several proteolytic frag-
ments in vitro (lane 4, arrowheads), whereas GFAP was resistant to caspase 3
cleavage (lane 2).
