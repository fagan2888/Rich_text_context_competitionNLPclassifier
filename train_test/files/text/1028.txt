Background: Previous studies of concealed firearm car-
rying among children and adolescents have focused on
individual risk factors.
Objective: To identify features of neighborhoods asso-
ciated with concealed firearm carrying among a repre-
sentative sample of youth from Chicago, Ill.
Design: Cross-sectional analysis of individual- and
neighborhood-level data collected by the Project on Hu-
man Development in Chicago Neighborhoods.
Setting: Families and neighborhoods in Chicago.
Participants: Population-based sample of 1842 multi-
ethnic youth aged 9 to 19 years and the 218 neighbor-
hoods in which they resided.
Main Outcome Measure: Whether youth had ever car-
ried a concealed firearm.
Results: Lifetime estimates for concealed firearm car-
rying were 4.9% for males and 1.1% for females. We found
thatyouthinsaferandlessdisorderedneighborhoodswere
less likely than youth in unsafe and more disordered
neighborhoods to carry concealed firearms. Specifi-
cally, multilevel nonlinear regression models identified
a positive association between concealed firearm carry-
ing and (1) community members' ratings of neighbor-
hoods as unsafe for children; (2) neighborhood social dis-
order; and (3) neighborhood physical disorder.
Neighborhood collective efficacy was negatively associ-
ated with concealed firearm carrying. Models con-
trolled for neighborhood economic indicators and indi-
vidual and family factors associated with the carrying of
concealed firearms by youth.
Conclusions: Youth are less likely to carry concealed fire-
arms in areas where there is less violence and increased
safety. Interventions to improve neighborhood condi-
tions such as increasing safety, improving collective ef-
ficacy, and reducing social and physical disorder may be
efficacious in preventing firearm use and its associated
injuries and death among youth.

UNDER FEDERAL LAW, INDI-
viduals younger than 18
years are prohibited from
owning handguns and in
most states from carry-
ing concealed weapons.1 Nonetheless, data
from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey2,3
(YRBS) and other studies indicate high lev-
els of self-reported gun carrying among
American youth. During the last several
years, the YRBS found that of high school
students in the United States, 7.6% in
19952 and 5.7% in 20013 reported having
carried a firearm in the preceding 30 days.
Not surprisingly, studies that ask if a child
or adolescent has ever carried a firearm
yield higher estimates than those that ask
about current firearm carrying.4 For ex-
ample, the 1994-1995 National Longitu-
dinal Study of Adolescent Health5 pro-
vided a national estimate of 9.3% of 7th
through 12th graders having ever carried
a firearm at school.
Almost all of the published litera-
ture about concealed firearm carrying by
youth focuses on how individuals who
carry concealed firearms differ from
those who do not. In aggregate, these
studies have provided a detailed picture
of individual-level predictors of carrying,
including male sex,6-10 minority back-
ground,11 cigarette smoking,6 alcohol
consumption,6,8,10,12 drug use,7,12-14 gang
membership,15 criminal activity,7 fear of
victimization,9,12,13,16,17 poor academic
performance,6,10 fighting,4,8,18 lack of con-
fidence in being able to stay out of
fights,6,13 and exposure to violence.5,19,20

Neighborhood characteristics associated with vio-
lence may play an additional and possibly synergistic role
in a youth's decision to carry a firearm. Consistent with
this possibility, fear of victimization9,12,13,16,17 in one's neigh-
borhood or school has been offered as a primary reason
why youth carry concealed firearms. In addition, behav-
iors associated with carrying such as drug and alcohol
use,21,22 lower academic achievement,23 delinquency,24 and
violent victimization25 are known to be influenced by com-
munity factors.
Levels of social and physical disorder are 2 features
of urban neighborhoods associated with fear of victimiza-
tion. When strangers behave in public spaces in ways that
are considered threatening, these behaviors constitute so-
cial disorder.26 Examples include interactions such as drug
dealing, prostitution, loitering, or public intoxication. In
contrast, physical disorder describes the environmental de-
terioration of urban landscapes, such as abandoned prop-
erties, graffiti, and discarded drug paraphernalia and con-
doms. In addition to making people fearful of being
victimized, observation of disorder can influence the at-
tributions that are made about a neighborhood and may
affect real estate prices, investors, and community resi-
dents' pride or willingness to actively contribute to its im-
provement.
Collectiveefficacy,ontheotherhand,isaneighborhood-
level construct that has been linked to reduced levels and
perceptions of violence. Sampson et al25 defined this con-
struct as a combination of social cohesion, represented by
mutual trust and solidarity between neighbors, and infor-
malsocialcontrol,orthecapacityofneighborhoodresidents

lective goals.
Few studies to date have had the opportunity to ex-

logicalframeworkemphasizingpotentialneighborhood-
level determinants of individual development. Ours pro-
videssuchanopportunitybecausequestionsaboutfirearm
carrying were embedded within a large multilevel study
of neighborhood-level determinants of violence. To our
knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to as-
sess the independent effects of individual-, family-, and
neighborhood-levelcharacteristicsontheprobabilitythat
a youth has carried a concealed firearm.
METHODS
Data come from the Project on Human Development in Chi-
cago Neighborhoods (PHDCN), a multidisciplinary study of
families and neighborhoods. Study families are residents of
Chicago, Ill, and are of diverse races and ethnicities, socioeco-
nomic status, and family structures. The PHDCN includes a
comprehensive community design as well as a longitudinal
cohort study embedded within the community design. Data
used in this study are cross-sectional and come from 4 sources:
(1) wave 2 of the longitudinal cohort study; (2) systematic
social observation of study neighborhoods; (3) an independent
community survey of Chicago residents; and (4) 1990 US cen-
sus data. A detailed description of the PHDCN's design and
methods is available elsewhere.27 The institutional review
boards of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of
Public Health (Boston, Mass) approved all procedures.
Informed consent was obtained from both caregivers and
youth prior to each interview.
SAMPLING
Sampling was accomplished in 2 stages. First, using 1990 US
census data, 343 neighborhood clusters that were geographi-
cally compact as well as similar in ethnic composition, socio-
economic status, housing density, and family structure were
identified and grouped into 7 strata of race and ethnic compo-
sition according to tertiles of socioeconomic level. Each neigh-
borhood cluster contained approximately 8000 residents. Among
these 21 strata were 3 empty cells; no neighborhood clusters
were more than 75% Hispanic with high socioeconomic sta-
tus, more than 75% white with low socioeconomic status, or
of mixed Hispanic and African American race with high socio-
economic status. Eighty neighborhood clusters were chosen for
intensive study from the remaining 18 cells using stratified ran-
dom sampling, except for 3 cells with fewer than 5 neighbor-
hood clusters that were sampled with certainty.
The second goal of sampling was to select families resid-
ing within each of the 80 selected neighborhood clusters to com-
pose the longitudinal cohort study sample. Households were
screened for eligible children and adolescents within 6 months
of 7 target cohort ages (0 [in utero through age 6 months], 3,
6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 years). Within a selected household, all
children and adolescents of eligible ages in 1994-1995 were in-
vited to participate along with at least 1 primary caregiver for
those younger than 18 years.
INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL DATA
Data used in our investigation were obtained from youth in the
9-, 12-, and 15-year-old cohorts for whom the response rate
was 74%. For these cohorts, baseline assessments were con-
ducted with 2345 youth beginning in 1995 and ending in 1997,
and follow-up interviews were done with 1921 youth approxi-
mately 24 months later, beginning in 1997 and ending in 2000.
The analytic sample for this investigation consisted of every-
one in this follow-up group who completed a questionnaire on
firearm carrying (n=1842). For the multilevel analyses
(n=1751), we excluded an additional 91 youth who moved out-
side the city limits of Chicago between baseline and follow-up
for whom we no longer had neighborhood data. Mean values
of the neighborhood variables calculated for this analytic sample
were the same (to the first decimal place) as those for the en-
tire baseline sample. The analytic sample had approximately
the same demographic composition as the baseline one.
NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL DATA
Community Survey
A random sample of adults were surveyed in 1995 to charac-
terize residents' perceptions of Chicago neighborhoods, with
oversampling done in the selected 80 neighborhood clusters.
There was a 75% response rate, resulting in 8782 study par-
ticipants representing all 343 neighborhood clusters. The sur-
vey focused on the social and organizational characteristics of
neighborhoods, including assessments of violence and percep-
tions of neighborhood danger. This sample was independent
of the longitudinal cohort sample of families.
Systematic Social Observation
For a description of natural social phenomena occurring in
neighborhood environments, a systematic social observation
study28 was conducted using block-by-block videotaping and
trained observers rating their observations as they were driven
down city streets at approximately 5 mph. This study was con-
ducted in 1995 and covered all 80 sampled neighborhood clus-

ters, recording data from 23816 face blocks (the left and right
sides of a street when one is in the middle of the road) for a
mean of 298 per neighborhood cluster. A random sample of
15141 videotaped face blocks was selected for coding owing
to budgetary constraints. Detailed information on physical con-
ditions, housing characteristics, types of businesses, and nega-
tive social interactions was coded.
In this study, models that included measures from the sys-
tematic social observation study had a smaller sample size
(n=1606) than those including data from the community sur-
vey because 236 participants had moved away from the 80 ini-
tial study neighborhoods before the follow-up interview. As de-
scribed earlier, the 1995 community survey covered the entire
city of Chicago; thus, participants who moved to other Chi-
cago neighborhoods were able to be kept in their particular mod-
els using data from the community survey. This increased the
neighborhood sample size (n=218).
MEASURES
Items regarding gun use were administered in the individual-
level cohort study. Youth were asked (1) whether they had ever
carried a concealed or hidden gun anywhere; (2) whether any-
one in their home kept a gun; and (3) whether any family mem-
bers had ever been shot or killed by a gun.
A composite measure of family socioeconomic status was
created based on principal components analysis29 of 3 variables--
parental income, parental education, and parental occupational
code--taking the maximum value for each if there were 2 par-
ents in the household. A neighborhood-level index of concen-
trated poverty was derived from 1990 US census data for the pro-
portion of residents who had an income lower than the poverty
line, were unemployed, or were receiving public assistance.
Individual-level exposure to violence was measured by ask-
ing youths about their experiences during the past year.30 Con-
firmatory factor analysis31 showed that 3 separate constructs
were present. Hierarchical item response theory models32 con-
firmed which items fit within each construct, and 3 scales were
developed: (1) victimization, (2) witnessing violence, and (3)
hearing about violence. These scales showed good reliability
and validity (R. T. Brennan, EdD, B.E.M., and F. Earls, MD,
unpublished data, 2004). Respondents were categorized as hav-
ing been victimized by violence if they reported being at-
tacked with a weapon, beaten up, chased, shot at, or seriously
threatened. If they had witnessed these same acts perpetrated
on somebody else and/or saw someone being shot or killed, they
were categorized as having witnessed violence. They were cat-
egorized as having heard about violence if they reported hear-
ing about someone they knew being sexually assaulted, shot,
or killed. Because the vast majority of the youth who carried
concealed firearms were in the highest quartile of exposure to
violence, dichotomous variables were also constructed for which
1 represented the highest quartile and 0 constituted the re-
mainder of the sample.
Subjects were also administered a reduced version of the
Youth Self-Report33 externalizing behavior problems scale, which
assesses delinquent and aggressive behaviors in the past 6
months. The scale scores are a sum of 21 items for which 0=not
true, 1=somewhat true, and 2=very true. To lessen response
burden in the follow-up interviews, a reduced version of the
Youth Self-Report scale was created with factor analysis using
the sample's full-scale data from baseline interviews. Factor load-
ings for individual items contributing to the various subscales
were examined, and items that loaded least strongly on the scale
were dropped. The Cronbach  was calculated before and af-
ter dropping these items to ensure that the reliability of the scale
measurement was not dramatically reduced. This was based both
on published values for the Youth Self-Report scale normative
samples33 and on the baseline results. The reduced instrument
included 8 of 13 items for the delinquent behavior subscale and
13 of 20 items for the aggressive behavior subscale.
Neighborhood conditions related to fear of victimization
were measured on 4 scales with established psychometric prop-
erties. Individual items in each of the scales are listed in Table 1.
The unsafe-to-play scale reflects residents' perceptions of the
safety of neighborhood clusters based on the 1995 commu-
nity survey. Collective efficacy, a summary measure of infor-
mal social control and social cohesion, was also derived from
the community survey.25 Each scale was formed by finding the
mean for the item responses. Although most respondents in the
community survey answered all of the items, anyone respond-
ing to at least 1 item on a scale provided data for the analysis.
Using an unconditional 3-level hierarchical linear item-
response model that took into account the number and diffi-
culty of the answered items, a person-specific standard error
was calculated and was used to adjust for missing responses.25
Scales of social disorder and physical disorder were derived from
the systematic social observation study; descriptions of the meth-
ods and psychometric properties of these scales have been pub-
lished previously.26,34 Ranges of values for each scale are pre-
sented in Table 1. Prior to using these scales in the models
described as follows, they were all standardized to have a mean
of 0 and an SD of 1.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
For variables that were categorical, the 2 test of proportions
was used to assess bivariate relationships between risk factors
and the carrying of concealed weapons. Spearman correlation
coefficients were used to test for bivariate relationships be-
tween carrying firearms and risk factors that were continuous,
including the 4 neighborhood-level scales in the study. Spear-
man correlation coefficients were chosen because the dichoto-
mous outcome variable is not normally distributed, requiring
a nonparametric test.
Because of the multilevel design, hierarchical nonlinear
modeling35 was used to estimate the relationship between
individual- and neighborhood-level independent variables and
youth gun carrying. The outcome was dichotomous, so the
analysis involved a standard hierarchical linear model with the
introduction of special weighting to linearize the outcome at
level 1. After convergence, the weights were recalculated. This
method resembles logistic regression, but by using multilevel
methods to account for clustering by neighborhoods, the re-
sult is a proper estimation of standard errors. It also makes it
possible to estimate contextual factors that may influence be-
havior independent of individual characteristics. Datasets were
prepared for analysis using SAS version 8.0 statistical software
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and were analyzed with the sta-
tistical program HLM 5.35
The goal of the data analysis was to estimate the magni-
tude of the association between 4 central neighborhood-level
constructs and youth firearm carrying, controlling for estab-
lished individual- and family-level risk factors. Initial models
included the neighborhood-level constructs, a fixed set of
individual-level variables (sex, age, race and ethnicity, and fam-
ily socioeconomic status), and neighborhood-level concen-
trated poverty. Theoretically, we considered the 4 neighborhood-
level constructs to measure distinct but overlapping aspects of
the environment. Because of high correlations between them,
they were not able to be modeled simultaneously. Instead, the
models that contained multilevel potential confounders were
used 4 times with each of the primary neighborhood expo-
sures added one at a time. Finally, individual-level risk factors
previously identified in the literature were added to each model:
whether the youth knew that a gun was kept at home, whether

a family member had been shot with a gun, whether the youth
had high exposure to violence in the past year (either witness-
ing violence, being victimized, or hearing about others being
victimized), and whether he or she had committed other acts
of delinquency and/or aggression the past 6 months.
RESULTS
Fifty-six youth (3%) indicated that they had carried a con-
cealed firearm. In the bivariate analyses in Table 2,
whereas only half (50%) of the sample were male, they
represented 82% of those carrying a concealed firearm.
More firearms were carried by older youth, with 71% of
the firearm carriers aged 16 to 19 years. There were no
significant differences in concealed firearm carrying by
race or ethnicity or between families of different socio-
economic status.
Although 10% of respondents reported living in a
household with a firearm, they accounted for 19% of those
who carried a firearm themselves. One third (32%) of re-
spondents reported that they had a family member who
had been shot with a gun, and these accounted for 76%
of participants who carried concealed firearms.
Of the 56 youth who reported having carried a con-
cealed gun, most had been exposed to high levels of vio-
lence: 93% were in the highest quartile on the scale of
witnessing violence in the past year, 63% were in the high-
est quartile of having heard about violent victimization
of acquaintances during the past year, and 91% were in
the highest quartile reporting victimization by violence
in the previous year. Similarly, most firearm carriers (63%)
were in the highest quartile on the scale of delinquent
and aggressive behaviors.
At the neighborhood level, there were significantly
higher rates of concealed firearm carrying by youth in
neighborhoods that were less safe and in those charac-
terized by greater social disorder, physical disorder, and
concentrated poverty. Youth living in neighborhoods with
higher levels of collective efficacy reported less firearm
carrying (Table 2). In multilevel multivariate models, all
of the neighborhood characteristics included in this study
were significantly associated with youth carrying con-
cealed firearms when controlling for economic condi-
tions at both family and neighborhood levels as well as
for age, sex, and race and ethnicity.
The primary focus of this investigation was whether
these neighborhood characteristics were associated with
concealed firearm carrying above and beyond indi-
vidual and family correlates. The final step was to in-
clude previously identified risk factors at the level of the
individual. Table 3 presents the results of models that
included variables measuring whether a gun was kept in

*The unsafe-to-play and collective efficacy scales were based on data from the 1995 community survey; the social disorder and physical disorder scales were
based on data from 1995 systematic social observation. The unsafe-to-play scale was a 5-point Likert-type scale with answers ranging from "strongly disagree" to
"strongly agree." The collective efficacy scale was also a 5-point Likert-type scale with answers ranging from "very likely" to "very unlikely" and "strongly
disagree" to "strongly agree." The social disorder and physical disorder scales were "yes/no" scales.

the home, whether a family member had been shot with
a gun, individual witnessing of violence, victimization,
hearing about others' victimization by violence, and de-
linquency or aggression by youth. For neighborhoods
rated as unsafe to play, the odds of youth carrying a con-
cealed firearm were increased (odds ratio [OR]=5.8; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.4-24.5); for collective effi-
cacy, the odds were decreased (OR=0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-
0.7); for social disorder, the odds were increased (OR=1.9;
95% CI, 1.2-3.2); and for physical disorder, the odds were
increased (OR=2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.2). Given that all of
the scales were standardized prior to analysis to have a
mean of 0 and an SD of 1, these findings can be inter-
preted as the odds of gun carrying associated with a 1-SD
increase in each neighborhood measure. There were no
significant changes in either the magnitude or direction
of the odds of youth carrying concealed firearms associ-
ated with neighborhood characteristics after individual-
level risk factors were included.
COMMENT
Consistent with the idea that social and organizational
characteristics of neighborhoods explain further varia-
tions than those accounted for by aggregated character-
istics of individuals and families,36 we found that neigh-
borhood characteristics likely to increase fear of
victimization predicted concealed firearm carrying among
Chicago youth. Specifically, carrying of concealed fire-
arms was positively related to both a neighborhood's level
of social and physical disorder and the scarcity of safe
places for children to play. These neighborhood-level as-
sociations held after controlling for individual-level and
family characteristics of respondents such as sex, age, ex-

*Data are presented as number (percentage). The sample size was 1842. We
used the 2 test of proportions to test for differences between categorical
variables and concealed firearm carrying; Spearman correlation coefficients
were calculated to test for differences between continuous measures and
concealed firearm carrying. Statistically significant differences at P.05 are in
bold.
An additional 54 respondents, including 1 who carried a gun, said that they
did not know if a gun was kept in the house or if a family member had been
shot.

posure to various forms of violence, household firearm
ownership, and other delinquent or aggressive behav-
iors and after accounting for economic disadvantages of
families and neighborhoods.
Additionally, youth who lived in neighborhoods with
higher levels of collective efficacy were significantly less
likely to carry a concealed firearm. Youth in these neigh-
borhoods may feel that the community provides a mea-
sure of vigilance and protection as well as a level of over-
sight that makes the act of carrying a firearm no longer
necessary or attractive. Many of the youth who lived in
neighborhoods with higher collective efficacy were still
exposed to violence; the correlation between collective
efficacy and witnessing violence was low at 0.11. Infor-
mal social control of children, a component of collec-
tive efficacy, was associated with reduced delinquent be-
havior of adolescents in Chicago in a previous study.37
Perhaps the social forces and norms found in these neigh-
borhoods protected youth from taking the extreme step
of arming themselves with guns even if they were ex-
posed to violence.
Previous studies have shown that most adults (91%)
who carry concealed firearms obtain them from their
home.6 Given that handgun ownership is illegal in Chi-
cago,1 youth who report guns kept at home may come
from families with a greater propensity for illegal behav-
ior. However, only 2 (4%) of 56 firearm-carrying youth
in our sample reported carrying a gun from home. In con-
trast, 64% had received or borrowed their gun from friends
or family, 4% had stolen or traded for the gun, 5% had
acquired the gun through unspecified means, and 23%
had bought the gun themselves, consistent with similar
findings by other investigators.38
Several individual-level risk factors previously re-
ported to predict concealed firearm carrying among youth
appear to predict carrying among Chicago youth, includ-
ing male sex,6-8,10,11,15,16 older age,15 having a family mem-
ber who has been shot,6 and other delinquent or aggres-
sivebehaviors.4,7,8,18 Wefoundastrongassociationbetween
individual exposure to violence and carrying a con-
cealed firearm, a relationship that held whether the youth
had experienced, witnessed, or heard about violence.
These results are consistent with literature that found that
the primary reason youth carry concealed firearms is for
self-protection.15,38,39 Although gun carriers in our sur-
vey overwhelmingly reported that they carry guns for self-
protection, some gun carrying may be by youth who are
engaged in a variety of criminal and antisocial activities.
We found an association between carrying a concealed
firearm and individual delinquency and aggression.
In this study, 4.9% of males and 1.1% of females be-
tween the ages of 9 and 19 years reported having carried
a concealed firearm. These levels are low relative to those
reported elsewhere,4,6,13,15,40 perhaps because of low rates
of gun ownership in Chicago, where handguns are ille-
gal.1 In the 1997 YRBS conducted in Chicago, the 30-

*Data are presented as odds ratio (95% confidence interval). The sample size was 1745 total and 1606 for models 3 and 4. Unsafe-to-play, social disorder,
physical disorder, and collective efficacy scales are highly intercorrelated, necessitating separate models to estimate the association between each of them and
gun carrying; concentrated poverty is included in all models. Social and physical disorder were measured only in the original 80 Chicago neighborhoods under
intensive study, so youth who moved beyond those 80 neighborhoods between the first and second interviews could not be included in these models. Statistically
significant differences at P.05 are in bold.
Data were determined using a continuous scale; odds ratio represents the odds of gun use associated with 1 SD of change in the scale.

day prevalence rates were reported to be 2.5% among fe-
males and 11.5% among males.41 Restricting the current
analysis to youth aged 14 to 18 years, the prevalence of
having carried a gun was 9.3% among males and 1.8%
among females. Thus, the prevalence in this study is still
lower than the YRBS estimates. One possible explana-
tion may be social desirability bias due to the differ-
ences in study methods. Carrying a concealed gun is a
rare and extreme activity; the YRBS is self-administered
and anonymous, whereas our study was interviewer ad-
ministered in subjects' homes. Therefore, the preva-
lence of firearm carrying measured in this study may be
an underestimate.
Our study has several limitations. These data come
from Chicago, a large city that is heavily segregated and
has particular laws that make handguns illegal to own.
The results may not be generalizable either to other ur-
ban areas without similar gun laws or segregation or to
nonurban areas. To the extent that youth who carry guns
contribute to adults' perceptions of the social impover-
ishment of their neighborhoods, it is possible that the re-
lationship between gun carrying and neighborhood is bi-
directional (predominantly the reverse of what we
describe) or not causally related. We were unable to evalu-
ate this possibility because we used cross-sectional data
and could not estimate neighborhood-level gun carry-
ing using data from our sample, having only 56 gun car-
riers distributed across 218 neighborhoods. A bidirec-
tional, causal relationship between gun carrying and
neighborhood safety offers the hope that an interven-
tion targeted at either firearm carrying or neighborhood
disorder might break or at least mitigate a seemingly vi-
cious cycle. In addition, we asked only whether youth
in our survey had ever carried a gun, not how often or
how recently. As a result, we are unable to determine
whether there is a relationship between the frequency of
gun carrying and our neighborhood scales. Finally, we
did not assess whether peers of the youths in the study
carried guns, a potentially important determinant of
whether a youth carries a firearm, although we did con-
trol for other delinquent and aggressive behaviors by the
respondents.
Despite these limitations, an important strength of
this study is the large, multilevel design that allows us to
examine the association between neighborhood social
processes and a rare outcome such as concealed firearm
carrying among adolescents. An additional advantage is
that our questions about firearm carrying and our mea-
sures of neighborhood characteristics were obtained
from separate samples. Because these data on neighbor-
hood features do not come from the youth participants
themselves, they provide an independent source of
information about perceived and observed levels of dis-
order, safety, and collective efficacy that exist across
neighborhoods.
Each of these neighborhood characteristics is po-
tentially modifiable and thus important when consider-
ing both primary and secondary prevention of youth vio-
lence. The neighborhood-level constructs identified as
strongly associated with gun carrying by youth in this
cohort have not previously been described and repre-
sent potential targets for public health interventions. De-
creasing the degree to which a community is burdened
by threatening or hostile behavior by adults, reclaiming
the number of public spaces available for children to play
in, and supporting adults who are willing to intervene
in the lives of their community's children may posi-
tively alter the social dynamics that currently contrib-
ute to concealed firearm carrying by youth.

What This Study Adds
Efficacious interventions are necessary to reduce the car-
rying of firearms by adolescents, a population at high risk
for gun-related injuries and death. Previous research has
identified individual-level risk factors for youth carry-
ing firearms, especially concerns regarding personal safety
in their communities. However, to our knowledge, no
studies have used a multilevel approach to identify pro-
cesses in those communities that may increase or de-
crease the risk of carrying firearms. This study uses a mul-
tilevel approach to identify potentially modifiable
neighborhood-level correlates of firearm carrying by ado-
lescents. Neighborhood social disorder, physical disor-
der, and the rating of neighborhoods as unsafe for chil-
dren to play in were each independently associated with
increased firearm carrying by youth. In addition, a posi-
tive social process, collective efficacy, was found to be
independently associated with decreased firearm carry-
ing. All of these neighborhood-level correlates re-
mained significant when individual-level risk factors were
included in the models, demonstrating that reducing so-
cial and physical disorder, increasing safety, and pro-
moting collective efficacy among neighbors have the po-
tential to decrease the prevalence of youth carrying
concealed firearms and to reduce gun-related injuries.
