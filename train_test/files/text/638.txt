We used the first wave of the Health and Retirement Survey to study the effect of health on
the labor force activity of black and white men and women in their 50s. The evidence we
present confirms the notion that health is an extremely important determinant of early labor
force exit. Our estimates suggest that health differences between blacks and whites can
account for most of the racial gap in labor force attachment for men. For women, when
participation rates are comparable, our estimates imply that black women would be
substantially more likely to work than white women were it not for the marked health
differences. We also found for both men and women that poor health has a substantially larger
effect on labor force behavior for blacks. The evidence suggests that these differences result
from black/white differences in access to the resources necessary to retire.

Race Differences in Labor Force
Attachment and Disability Status1

For most of the post-World War II period, the labor
force participation rates of working-age black men
have been significantly lower than those of white
men, and this gap has tended to widen as men age.
Although black women have historically shown a
greater attachment to the labor force than white
women, this difference has tended to narrow or
disappear as women enter their 40s and 50s. For both
men and women, participation rates tend to drop
faster among blacks than among whites as workers
approach their 60s.
It seems plausible that health limitations on men's
and women's capacities for work are important for
understanding these patterns. Black men and women
are substantially more likely to identify themselves as
physically unable to work; in absolute terms, the
Traction of all men and women reporting themselves
unable to work rises with age, and the gap between
whites and blacks increases dramatically with age.
The differences in the proportion of older, working-

age black and white men identifying themselves as
physically unable to work are of similar magnitude to
the gap in male labor force participation between
these groups and accounts for most of the difference
in labor force participation rates (Bound, Schoen-
baum, & Waidmann, 1995; Hayward, Friedman, &
Chen, 1996). Similar calculations for women suggest
that, were black women in their 40s and 50s to experi-
ence work limitation rates similar to those of white
women in these age ranges, they would continue to
show a greater attachment to the work force.
The fact that more blacks than whites report that
they are limited in their ability to work, or are unable
to work at all, presumably reflects differences in
health to a considerable extent. We know that the
health of middle-aged blacks is worse than that of
middle-aged whites and that this difference widens
through middle age (Geronimus, 1992; House et al.,
1990; Ries, 1990). Blacks are approximately twice as
likely as whites to report suffering from diabetes,
hypertension, and arthritis (Manton, Patrick, & John-
son, 1987; Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1995), and
clinical evidence suggests that, relative to whites,
blacks have higher rates of undiagnosed diabetes
and roughly the same rate of undiagnosed hyperten-
sion (Andersen, Mullner, & Cornelius, 1987). In addi-
tion, death rates are higher for blacks at most ages
and for nearly all causes.
At the same time, since disabilities reflect a gap
between an individual's capacity and the demands of
an activity (Pope &Tarlov, 1991), the difference in the
fractions of blacks and whites identifying themselves
as limited in their capacity to work could be due, in
part, to differences in the nature of the jobs typically
held by older black and white adults, respectively.
For instance, we know that blacks tend to be dispro-
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 311
portionately concentrated in physically strenuous
jobs (Park, Wagener, Winn, & Pierce, 1993). It seems
plausible that a given health problem is more likely to
be disabling for workers in such jobs.
Because much, although not all, of the evidence
that black/white differences in disability rates can
account for differences in labor force participation
rates relies on self-reports of disability status, we
cannot rule out the possibility that this association
stems from factors that affect the propensity of
blacks versus whites to report themselves as dis-
abled. Economists have noted that the pecuniary
rewards for continued work are smaller for blacks
than for whites while employment opportunities are
worse. These economic factors may provide incen-
tives for able-bodied blacks to report themselves as
disabled (Parsons, 1980) or for blacks with disabilities
to adjust their labor force behavior to accommodate
those disabilities at earlier ages than they might if the
rewards of continued labor force participation were
greater (Bound & Waidmann, 1992). From a different
perspective, social psychologists have observed that
among those outside the labor force, blacks are
more likely to report themselves as disabled while
whites are more likely to report themselves as re-
tired. They argue that reporting differences may be
conditioned by differences in role identification or in
the extent to which work is seen as central to the
identities of whites versus blacks (Gibson, 1988,
1991a, 1991b; Jackson & Gibson, 1985).
This study uses the first wave (beta release) of the
Health and Retirement Survey (HRS; Juster & Suz-
man, 1995) to examine patterns of labor force partici-
pation among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic
white adults in their 50s, with particular emphasis on
black/white differences in health. The extensive and
varied health measures available in the HRS allow us
to resolve some of the ambiguities regarding the
interpretation of self-reported work disability. Until
recently, nationally representative survey data were
not available that contained both the detailed health
information and detailed labor force and economic
information necessary to disentangle the various in-
fluences on work disability. Rather than relying on a
single measure of the complex concept of work dis-
ability, we are able to use more specific measures of
health (chronic condition prevalence and activity
limitation).
Specifically, we examine the extent to which black/
white differences in labor force status are associated
with black/white differences in health and socioeco-
nomic characteristics. For men, we hypothesize that
a significant part of observed race differences in
labor force behavior between blacks and whites can
be accounted for by actual health differences be-
tween these two populations. For women, we hy-
pothesize that black women's labor force participa-
tion rates would be above those of white women in
the absence of real health differences between these
groups. Finally, given the different social and eco-
nomic circumstances faced by middle-aged black
and white men and women, we hypothesize that
blacks and whites differ not just in their levels of
health status, but also in the way health affects labor
market participation.
Methods
Data
The HRS covers a national sample of people born
between 1931 and 1941 (inclusive); the first wave was
conducted in 1992/1993, and the sample frame pri-
marily covers individuals aged 51-61 (although some
respondents are aged 50 or 62). The HRS contains
information on many of the forces thought to influ-
ence labor market behavior, including extensive
measures of health status and functional ability (at
least for a labor force survey), income, assets, pen-
sion coverage, demographic characteristics, and
family structure. The HRS oversamples blacks, His-
panics and residents of the State of Florida, and all
analyses are weighted accordingly.
The HRS includes the spouses/partners of the sur-
vey population even if they themselves are out of the
age range of the sample frame. Because respondents
out of the sample frame do not constitute a repre-
sentative sample, they are excluded here (although
information from their records was used to identify
household characteristics where appropriate). The
data set is thus restricted to respondents initially in
the sample frame, as well as those spouses/partners
born between 1931 and 1941. For ease of analysis, the
data have been further restricted to non-Hispanic
white and non-Hispanic black respondents. In addi-
tion, basic demographic characteristics (e.g., gen-
der, age, or race/ethnicity) were unavailable for sev-
eral respondents, and these records were also
excluded. Based on these restrictions, the pool of
eligible respondents is 8,655. However, several.re-
spondents did not respond to summary questions
about their health and/or disability status and were
excluded. The reduced data set contains 8,637 re-
spondents, 4,569 women and 4,068 men. In this sam-
ple, 37% of black and white women are out of the
labor force, while 29% of black men and 16% of white
men are out of the labor force.
We note that this analysis derives from economic
models of retirement, in which decisions about con-
tinued labor force participation at older ages and in
deteriorated states of health depend, in part, on the
financial and other economic alternatives faced by
individuals. The Health and Retirement Survey in-
cludes data important for modeling these alterna-
tives, including earnings histories from Social Secu-
rity records and details regarding the nature and
availability of pension and health insurance cover-
age. With only one wave of data, it is nearly impos-
sible to model the income available to individuals
under several alternative scenarios (e.g., work, re-
tirement, disability). As a result, we do not attempt to
include these variables in our analysis.
Because there is a strong correlation between eco-
nomic and health variables (individuals facing lower
rewards to continued work are typically also in worse
health), the fact that we cannot adequately model the
312 The Gerontologist
economic incentives facing workers has important
implications for the interpretation we give our esti-
mates. In particular, our estimates should not be
thought of as causal. Instead, they are probably best
interpreted as an accounting exercise: We are trying
to gauge the extent to which measurable differences
in capacity to work between blacks and whites can
account for observed differences in labor force sta-
tus. In this framework, residual race differences in
participation that remain after controlling for differ-
ences in health and demographic characteristics re-
flect differences in economic and social constraints
on resources.
Measures
Labor Force Participation. -- Consistent with the
rest of the literature, we define labor force participa-
tion as either working, unemployed but looking for
work, or temporarily laid off or on sick leave. The
HRS also contains extensive information on a variety
of factors that may influence labor force behavior.
Because participation in federal income mainte-
nance programs targeted at the disabled often pre-
cludes substantial labor force activity, our model of
labor force behavior includes measures of applica-
tion for and participation in such programs. The
disability section of the HRS contains such informa-
tion on the two largest of these programs, Social
Security Disability Insurance (Dl) and Supplemental
Security Income (SSI). Individuals who report that
they have a health problem that limits their capacity
for work are asked whether they have ever applied
for benefits from the Dl or SSI programs. Those who
have applied are asked whether or not they were
awarded benefits.
Demographic. --All analyses were conducted sep-
arately by sex. The multivariate models outlined here
include controls for several demographic and other
individual characteristics, including age in years; ed-
ucational attainment, given by four categories (less
than a high school diploma, high school graduate,
some college, college graduate); whether the HRS
interview was conducted by a proxy respondent; and
whether the respondent is currently married with
spouse present or living with a partner (a single
dummy variable).
Health. --The HRS includes an extensive range of
measures of self-reported health, including general
health status; prevalence of 39 specific conditions;
measures of physical limitation in performing 21
daily activities; 11 measures of mood and depression
based on the CES-D depression index (Radloff, 1977),
and 3 measures of vitality. The survey also contains
questions necessary to construct the CAGE alcohol-
ism index (Mayfield, McLeod, & Hall, 1974). Inclu-
sion of this index had no discernible effect on our
results, but high item non-response would have re-
quired dropping several observations. Conse-
quently, this index was not included in the results
reported here. Because spouses were asked the
same health questions, it is also possible to include
measures of the spouse's health, although our analy-
sis found that this has no significant impact on labor
force activity after we controlled for the respon-
dent's own health.
We note that there are good reasons to believe that
social forces influence individuals' responses to
health questionnaires (Waidmann, Bound, & Schoen-
baum, 1995). In particular, there is a legitimate con-
cern that blacks and whites may respond differently
to the kinds of questions asked in the HRS. For exam-
ple, there is some evidence that for a given level of
actual morbidity, blacks may be less likely than whites
to report suffering from specific chronic conditions
(Andersen et al., 1987). In addition, although some
studies have found that blacks are no more likely than
whites to suffer from serious mental illness (Kessler et
al., 1994; Williams, Takeuchi, & Adair, 1992), this
finding may be influenced by the nature of the diag-
nostic instruments used (Adebimpe, 1981; Neigh-
bors, Jackson, Campbell, & Williams, 1989; Williams
& Fenton, 1994). Systematic differences in reporting
will influence any results based on self-reported mea-
sures of health status. To some extent, however, our
statistical methods may mitigate this influence.
Modeling Health
For our empirical models, we seek appropriate
measures of health status. There are a number of
possible alternatives for such measures. Because we
are interested in how health affects labor market
behavior, the most direct method might be to use
information on self-reported work limitations. How-
ever, black/white differences in the prevalence of
self-reported work limitations may reflect a number
of different factors than health per se. Another possi-
bility is to use individuals' reports on their overall
health. However, this seems unnecessarily impre-
cise, both because it ignores the many detailed
health measures available in the HRS and because
the range of variation in self-rated health is limited by
construction. In addition, different individuals may
implicitly be responding on different scales, making
responses difficult to compare across individuals.
This heterogeneity is likely to threaten inferences
based on such measures (Bound, 1991).
Another alternative is to include the numerous
detailed health measures directly. This makes maxi-
mal use of the available information on health status.
In addition, survey questions that are more specific
and concrete should be less subjective and therefore
less susceptible to the kinds of problems raised ear-
lier. However, doing so presents difficulties in inter-
pretation. First, there is no obvious way to quantify
the marginal effect of changes in health per se on the
outcomes of interest, and thus there is no way to
compare the effects of marginal changes in health for
blacks and whites, respectively. In a sense, there are
as many black/white differences as there are health
covariates. In addition, the various detailed mea-
sures are presumably collinear to some degree (e.g.,
due to comorbidity), and such collinearity would
Vol. 36, No. 3,1996 313
also complicate interpreting the estimated coeffi-
cients on particular health measures.
Given these considerations, another possibility is
to summarize the detailed health measures. The
health science literature includes numerous meth-
ods for doing so, in particular for summarizing infor-
mation on functional ability into a single measure
(e.g., Suurmeijer et al., 1994). Other researchers
have summarized measures of morbidity (e.g.,
House et al., 1990). The CES-D depression scale is
included directly in the HRS. In general, each sum-
mary measure represents a weighted average of a
number of components, where the weighting
scheme is derived theoretically.
As an alternative to these methods, we use a latent
variable model to construct an index of health. Spe-
cifically, we imagine the following model:
h* = + 0'Z + v (1)
where h* represents health, a latent variable, and X is
a vector of demographic characteristics. The vector Z
is a vector of detailed health measures (e.g., chronic
conditions, physical limitations, CES-D, and vitality).
Although we do not observe h*, we observe general
health status, h, a categorical variable with five levels
(excellent-poor). Assuming h is a monotonically in-
creasing step function of h* (i.e., h takes the value
"excellent" when h* is less than some threshold
value, n-!, "very good" when |x, < h* < JJL2
, etc.) and
assuming that the error term v is distributed nor-
mally, Equation (1) defines an ordered probit model.
To create a summary measure of health, we first
estimate Equation (1) to obtain estimates of B4
and 8
(as well as the |xs). We then use the estimated coeffi-
cients from the model to construct
fi* = fcX, + fi'Z, (2)
for each individual as a proxy for health status in our
labor force models. The model is ordered so that
larger (more positive) values of fi* represent worse
health. As in the rest of this analysis, models are
estimated separately by sex. However, in order to
use this measure to compare blacks and whites, we
pool black and white respondents and calculate a
single measure that applies to both. (In fact, when we
estimated Equation [1] separately by race, the coeffi-
cients on the explanatory variables tended to be of
very similar magnitudes and jointly were not statisti-
cally significantly different from one another.)
It is worth mentioning an important respect in
which fi* differs from other indices in the literature.
The fact that ft* is a function not only of Z (the
detailed health measures) but also of X (demo-
graphic characteristics) means that /?* has been ad-
justed for the extent to which, for all the reasons
mentioned earlier, the detailed health measures
available in the HRS only partially measure race dif-
ferences in health. As a result, even if the Z vector
does not adequately account for health differences
between blacks and whites, fi* will. The one situation
in which using fi* to measure health differences will
tend to under (or over) estimate differences between
blacks and whites is if blacks are optimistic (or pessi-
mistic) relative to whites when answering the general
health question (Bound, 1991).
Modeling Labor Force Participation
Much of the literature on race differences in labor
force behavior focuses primarily on whether or not
respondents are participating in the labor force.
However, we know that blacks and whites differ both
in the rewards for continued work (e.g., blacks earn
substantially lower wages on average) and in the
economic resources available to them should they
leave the labor force (e.g., blacks have substantially
lower assets [Smith, 1993] and are less likely than
whites to be covered by private pensions [Hersch &
White-Means, 1993]). Black women in our sample are
also less likely than white women to be married --
48% of black women and 76% of white women are
married or living with a partner. Furthermore, tabula-
tions using the HRS indicate that black women and
men who are out of the labor force are more likely to
receive income from the Dl or SSI programs and on
average receive a higher fraction of total income
from these sources (results are available from the
authors). These findings suggest that the use of pub-
lic insurance programs such as Dl and SSI differen-
tially affects the labor force decisions of blacks and
whites, and in particular that black women and men
are less likely to have the resources to retire early
unless they can qualify for federal money. In addi-
tion, because of program restrictions on income
received from other sources, the receipt of DI/SSI
benefits effectively precludes individuals from being
in the labor force. Together, these factors suggest
that modeling labor force participation without ac-
counting for black/white differences in DI/SSI appli-
cation and participation may obscure black/white
differences in labor force behavior.
In this context, we describe current labor force
status as follows. In addition to asking about current
labor force status, the HRS asks respondents
whether they have applied for benefits from either
Dl or SSI and whether they have received benefits
from either program. We define three indicator vari-
ables, Lif
Alf
and R, that equal 1 if the individual is in
the labor force, has applied for DI/SSI benefits, and
has received DI/SSI benefits, respectively. Then the
probability that a respondent is out of the labor force
is given by
Pra,=0) = Pra;
=0|/?,.=1)[Pr(/?(
= 1 |A
0)] (3)
where the notation Pr(x | y) means "the probability of
x, given y." The first term in Equation (3) represents
the probability that a respondent applies for bene-
fits, is accepted, and is out of the labor force. The
second term represents the joint probability that the
respondent either doesn't apply for benefits but is
out of the labor force or that the respondent applies,
is rejected, and is out of the labor force.
Following from Equation (3), we therefore estimate
three models: the probability that a respondent has
314 The Gerontologist
applied for disability benefits (Equation 4), the prob-
ability that respondents who have applied have re-
ceived benefits (Equation 5), and the probability of
being out of the labor force among respondents who
are not receiving benefits (Equation 6).
Pr(/\, = 1) = F(p1
'X,.+81
/),*) (4)
0) = F(p3X/
+ 83
/7*) (6)
In each model, X, is a vector of demographic vari-
ables, h* represents health, a latent variable, and F(«)
represents the logistic distribution. Empirical estima-
tion of Equations (4)-(6) will maintain the identity in
Equation (3), because logit models have the useful
property that the average of predicted probabilities
will equal the actual probability of any outcome.
Because substantial work activity is taken as evi-
dence that an individual is capable of work and leads
to disqualification from receiving disability benefits,
very few recipients of DI/SSI work. For ease of analy-
sis, we will assume that none work. This assumption
has the effect of inflating predicted rates of nonpar-
ticipation by a trivial amount (less than half of a
percentage point in this sample).
Analysis Method
We now turn to the central question posed by this
research: what the labor force participation rate of
black men and women would be if their health status
were the same as that of their white counterparts. We
estimate all models separately by race and sex. Fol-
lowing Equations (4)-(6), we estimate P = F[$'W
X
+ bw
h*] for the white sample and P = f[$'b
X + Sb
h*]
for the black sample. In this notation, P represents
the respective outcome variables from Equations (4)-
(6), X and h* are defined as in the previous section,
and the vectors pw
and p6
and the terms 8W
and 86
represent the race-specific coefficients to be esti-
mated.
We seek to estimate what the levels of DI/SSI appli-
cation, DI/SSI receipt, and labor force participation
would be among black respondents if blacks had the
same distribution of the explanatory variables -- de-
mographic and health characteristics -- as white re-
spondents in the sample. The nature of the nonlinear
estimation used here precludes directly comparing
coefficients across the various models to assess the
relationship between the various health and function
variables on the one hand and the black/white gap in
labor force participation on the other. Instead, we use
the estimated coefficients from our models to simu-
late the effects of such standardization.
Using the preceding notation, we let Pt

h*] represent the predicted prevalence/level for
the /th white in the sample, where Sw

repre-
sent estimated coefficients. Similarly, P, = Ftj^X,
+ $>b
h*] represents the predicted prevalence/level for
the/th black respondent. For the simulation, we then
calculate P, = FIJ^X,-*-§,,/),*] for each white sample
member and then average across the white sample.
The resulting number represents the predicted prev-
alence for blacks were they to have the same distri-
bution of characteristics as white respondents in the
sample.
Although we could also use white coefficients and
black characteristics, the thought experiment would
be different. Part of the empirical difference be-
tween blacks and whites is caused by differences in
the social environment. These simulations assume
that we do not change that environment for blacks,
but rather change only education levels, marital sta-
tus, and health. Obviously, our choice of simulation
techniques will affect our results substahtively only
when the logit coefficients differ between blacks and
whites. ,
Thus, it is important to address the issue of the
magnitude of the difference between black and
white coefficients. Not only are blacks more likely to
be in poor health than whites, but differences be-
tween the groups in terms of labor market experi-
ences and in terms of skills imply that health may
very well have a larger effect on the labor market
activity of black men and women relative to whites.
One way to examine the differential response to
health status is to simulate equal improvements in
health status for otherwise identical black and white
respondents using race-specific coefficients. For
these simulations, we calculate the average values
(by sex) of health (/?*), first for respondents who
report their health as "very good" or "excellent" and
then for respondents who report their health to be
"fair" or "poor." Then, for a 55-year-old respondent
with a high school education, we simulate each of
the outcomes for the average individual in good
health and the average individual in poor health.
These simulations demonstrate the differential effect
of health on the labor force participation of blacks
and whites as well as the differential effects for mar-
ried and unmarried individuals.
Results
Black/White Differences in Health
Black women and men in our sample are signifi-
cantly more likely than whites to report their overall
health as fair or poor: 36% of black women report
being in fair/poor health, compared to 17% of white
women, while 33% of black men and 17% of white
men report fair/poor health. Black women and men
in the HRS sample frame are also significantly more
likely to report having most specific conditions as-
sessed in the survey, and have universally greater
difficulty performing each activity of daily living and
instrumental activity of daily living than their white
counterparts (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1995).
To put these differences in the context of our
health index, Table 1 presents estimates of the coeffi-
cient on the race dummy from several alternative
specifications of Equation (1). Given the discrete
nature of the dependent variable, the units of h* are
arbitrary. Standard practice (and most computer pro-
grams) normalize estimates so that var(v) = 1. How-
ever, as we move across specifications, the interpre-

tation of v changes. To maintain comparability, we
have chosen to normalize h* such that var(/?*) = 1
(Winship & Mare, 1984). As a result, coefficients can
be interpreted as partially standardized, that is, as
the effect of a unit change in the independent vari-
able in terms of standard deviations on health.
As we expect, being black is associated with
poorer health. Thus, the health of an average black
woman is .588 standard deviations worse than that of
the average white woman in our sample, while the
health of the average black man is .398 standard
deviations worse than that of the average white man!
As other demographic control variables are added
(Model 2), the coefficient decreases in magnitude:
Controlling for marital status, proxy status, and edu-
cation accounts for 26% (e.g., 1-.433/.588) of the
health difference among women and 44% among
men. Controlling for age and the full set of detailed
health measures eliminates 56% of the health gap for
women and 41% of the gap for men. When the
demographic and detailed health characteristics are
entered together (Model 3), the coefficient is further
reduced but not eliminated, with around 40% of the
black/white gap remaining. The fact that including
education and marital status in the health equations
lowers the magnitude of the coefficients on race
implies that race differences in education and marital
status can statistically account for part, but not all, of
the large health difference between middle-aged
whites and blacks (Schoenbaum & Waidmann, 1995).
The substantial residual race differences that we
continue to find in the last row of Table 1 presumably
reflect primarily differences in "actual" health that are
not captured by the detailed health measures avail-
able in the HRS. Although the extensive health mea-
sures available in the HRS should avoid some of the
problems associated with measures based on the
overall global measure, even the measures in the HRS
only partly describe individual health status. They do
not cover all aspects of health; they are subject to
measurement error (Edwards et al., 1994; Mathiowetz
& Lair, 1994); and with respect to specific conditions,
they cover prevalence but provide little information
regarding severity. In addition, to the extent that
blacks do respond to the specific health questions in
the HRS differently than do whites, the coefficient on
race in Equation (1) will also pick this up.

Accounting for Labor Force Differences:
Race Differences in the Distribution of Health
Table 2 presents the results of the labor force
simulations described earlier. The dependent vari-
ables are the respective labor force outcomes, as
discussed previously. The left side of each panel lists
different model specifications (the demographic
variables are defined in Table 1a, while the health
measures are described here). Because the overall
focus of Table 2 is on black/white differences in labor
force outcomes and not on the effects of the covari-
ates on labor force status per se, information on the
regression coefficients is not presented here. In-
stead, we present actual and predicted rates for re-
spective outcomes.
The first two columns in Table 2 present estimates
based on Equation (4), the probability that respon-
dents applied for DI/SSI, and Equation (6), the proba-
bility that respondents who are not on DI/SSI are out
of the labor force. Although we estimated Equation
(5), the probability of receiving DI/SSI among re-
spondents who applied, we do not present results
from this model because none of the independent
variables has much explanatory power. As a result,
the predicted proportion of Dl applicants who re-
ceive benefits is nearly constant, regardless of the
specification used.
The final column in Table 2 presents the overall
probability that respondents are out of the labor
force. These probabilities are not estimated directly,
but rather are derived from Equation (3). Specifically,
we used the estimated results from Equations (4)-(6),
together with the assumption that all respondents
who receive DI/SSI are out of the labor force, to solve
316 The Gerontologist
for the left side of Equation (3), the probability of
being out of the labor force.
Application for DI/SSI. --The first column in Table
2 indicates that black women and men are much
more likely to apply for DI/SSI. Because blacks and
whites have essentially identical age distributions in
our sample (results available from the authors), age
alone plays no role in black/white differences in
labor force outcomes in our sample, but controlling
for age and education (Model 1) accounts for approx-
imately a third of the gap for both women and men.
Adding marital status to this model (Model 2) ac-
counts for a total of more than 60% of the gap among
women and about half the gap for men. The differ-
ence in predicted rates between Models 1 and 2 gives
the marginal effect of differences in marital status,
which indicate that differences in marital status alone
account for 29% of the gap among women and 15%
among men. Adding controls for health accounts for
116% (Model 3) of the difference in application rates
between black and white women, and 97% of the
difference among men.
Out of Labor Force/Not on DI/SSI. -- The next
column in Table 2 indicates that, among respondents
who are not on DI/SSI, black women are substantially
less likely than white women and black men are
substantially more likely than white men to be out of
the labor force. Model 1 indicates that if black
women who are not on DI/SSI had the educational
attainment of white women, an even lower fraction
of them would be out of the labor force. Model 2
indicates that differences in marital status have equal
and opposite effects as education differences. Fi-
nally, Model 3 indicates that if black women who are
not on DI/SSI had the health status of white women
in this group, their labor force participation would be
substantially higher than it currently is.
Among men who are not on DI/SSI, controlling for
education differences widens the gap between
blacks and whites, the opposite of the effect ob-
served for women. This apparently anomalous find-
ing, however, seems to be a result of the imprecise
estimate of the effect of educational attainment in
the underlying logit. The marginal effect of control-
ling for differences in marital status is to narrow the
gap between black and white men, lowering the
fraction of blacks who are out of the labor force.
Similarly, controlling for differences in health status
narrows the black/white difference, raising the pre-
dicted labor force participation of black men.
Out of Labor Force. -- The final column in Table 2
examines overall black/white differences in labor
force participation. As noted earlier, equal fractions
of black and white women are out of the labor force,
while a much higher fraction of black men is cur-
rently out of the labor force. For women, Model 1
indicates that, controlling for differences in educa-
tional attainment, black women would have higher
participation rates than white women. After control-
ling for education, differences in marital status do
not account for any of the difference in participation
rates; this finding is consistent with the previous
findings, which indicate that higher rates of marriage
lower the predicted application rate of black women
but raise the predicted likelihood that black women
not on DI/SSI would be out of the labor force. Finally,
Model 3 suggests that, in the absence of health
differences between black and white women, a
much lower percentage of black than white women
would be out of the labor force.
In terms of Equation (3), these results imply that
more than a third of the black women currently out
of the labor force would be in the labor force if their
demographic and health characteristics were the
same as those of white women. Our findings imply
that more than 70% of this increase is due to de-
creases in the fraction receiving disability benefits.
The rest is made up of increases in the participation
rate of black women who do not receive benefits, as
seen in the middle set of simulations. We find that
poor health is strongly implicated in reducing the
participation of black women who do not receive
benefits. Relatively low levels of educational at-
tainment also suppress participation, whereas rela-
tively lower rates of marriage serve to inflate
participation rates.
Among men, black/white differences in education,
marital status, and health account for substantial frac-
tions of the black/white differences in labor force
participation. Education differences alone account
for 12% of the gap, while differences in marital status
account for a further 17%. Finally, after controlling for
demographic differences, differences in health status
(Model 3) account for an additional 54% of the gap.
In terms of Equation (3), more than one-third of
black men who are out of the labor force would be
working if they had the demographic and health
characteristics of white men. Our results imply that
most of this increase (about 80%) can be accounted
for by decreases in the fraction receiving disability
benefits. The participation rate for the non-DI popu-
lation would increase with improvements in health,
but not nearly as much as they would for women who
do not receive benefits. The only anomalous finding
in this table is that for those not on Dl, black men
with higher levels of education work less than those
with lower levels of education.
Accounting for Labor Force Differences:
Race Differences in the Effects of Health
Application for DI/SSI. -- Table 3(A) presents
results for the probability of applying for DI/SSI. Poor
health is a very strong predictor of application and is
stronger for blacks than for whites. This result is
particularly true when comparing white and black
men. Although application rates for men in good
health are similarly small for blacks and whites, black
men in poor health are much more likely to apply for
benefits. This may reflect differences in skills and
experiences between blacks and whites, which may
lead blacks to have greater difficulty adapting to the
onset of poor health; or to the fact that the ratio of

disability benefits to previous labor income is typi-
cally higher for blacks than whites, especially among
men. In addition, for every race, sex, and health
category, unmarried women and men are signifi-
cantly more likely to apply for DI/SSI. Unmarried
women may be more likely to have sufficient em-
ployment history to be eligible to apply for Dl and
sufficiently low household income to qualify for SSI,
while married men generally have stronger labor
force attachment than unmarried men.
Out of Labor Force/Not on DI/SSI. -- Table 3(B)
presents results for the probability of being out of
the labor force among respondents who are not on
DI/SSI. Poor health is a strong predictor of being out
of the labor force, although the odds ratios are much
smaller than in the previous panel, and the effect of
poor health is stronger for blacks than for whites.
Although participation rates for men in good health
are similar for blacks and whites, black men in poor
health are much more likely to be out of the labor
force than their white counterparts. Several explana-
tions for this dramatic difference seem possible.
First, differences in job histories and employer will-
ingness to accommodate workers in poor health may
work in favor of white men staying in the labor force.
It is also reasonable to believe that the relative re-
wards for continued work (wages) favor white men.
This explanation, however, leaves unanswered the
question of what these men do for income. One
possibility for married men might be reliance on
spousal income.
Among women, married black and white women
in poor health are significantly more likely to be out
of the labor force than any other group of women.
Black married women in good health are much less
likely than white women to be out of the labor force,
as are married black women in poor health, although
this difference is somewhat smaller. Although un-
married black women in good health are about as
likely to be out of the labor force as their white
counterparts, black women in poor health are more
likely to be out of the labor force than their white
counterparts. These findings for women suggest, as
others have found, that in good health, black women
rely more on their own resources than white women.
Out of Labor Force. -- Table 3(C) presents results
for the overall probability of being out of the labor
force; as in Table 2, the results are derived from the
previous models rather than estimated directly. As
expected, we find that for overall labor force partici-
pation, health is relatively more important for blacks
than for whites, particularly in the labor force partici-
pation of black men.
Discussion
Our findings from the Health and Retirement Sur-
vey indicate that the relatively poor health of black
men and women, when compared to their white
counterparts, accounts for much of the apparent
difference in the timing of labor force exit. Health
differences would appear to account for virtually all
of the two-to-one difference between the fraction of
black and the fraction of white middle-aged men out
of the work force. Among women, our results sug-
gest that older black women would have higher labor
force participation than white women, as they do at
younger ages, if black women had health status simi-
lar to whites in our sample.
Our findings also seem to indicate that although
health is important for both blacks and whites in
accounting for early exits from the labor force, it
seems to play a more central role for blacks than for
whites. We have found consistent evidence suggest-
ing that blacks in poor health are more likely to leave
the workforce than whites in poor health. It seems
plausible that this difference in responsiveness re-
flects the very different social and economic envi-
ronments faced by the two populations. On the one
hand, blacks in good health are less likely to have
access to the financial resources to permit them to
318 The Gerontologist
retire early. They are less able to count on a spouse's
earnings, have less in the way of financial assets, and
black men, in particular, are less likely to be in jobs
that include pension benefits. On the other hand,
both black men and women are more likely to be in
physically demanding jobs, jobs for which good
health is important, and those with impairments
may have particular trouble finding alternative
employment.
Although our results are suggestive of the factors
that explain why blacks seem more responsive than
whites to poor health, the Health and Retirement
Survey contains much information that might shed
more light on these factors. Future work, especially
that which utilizes the longitudinal nature of the
study, should not only investigate the source of the
residual differences, but also examine the conse-
quences of these differences for the economic well-
being of older black and white adults.

bTo questions about functional limitations, respondents could answer
1 = Not at all difficult 3 = Somewhat difficult 5 = Don't do
2 = A little difficult 4 = Very difficult/can't do
We recoded response 5 as response 4. The resulting four responses were rescaled to a standard normal distribution. That is, if F(x) is the
cumulative standard normal function, and if A% answered 1, B% answered 2, C% answered 3, and D% answered 4, responses would be
recoded such that those responding A would be assigned V such that F(V) = A, those answering 2 would be assigned W such that F(W) =
A + B, and so on. When responses to these questions were missing, the value of the normalized variable was imputed. Individuals with
missing values were assigned the appropriate race/gender specific mean adjusted for the individual's value of the general health status
variable. Finally, for each measure, all values were normalized (by adding or subtracting a constant) so that white men had a mean value of
zero for each limitation.
