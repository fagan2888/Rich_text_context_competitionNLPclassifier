Abstract
Appointment nonadherence is a health behavior that represents a burden to health care systems. On March 1, 2015, a
new negative reinforcement intervention involving "service fees" for a visit without appointment was implemented at King
Abdullah University Hospital in Jordan. To evaluate the effect of this intervention in improving patient adherence to medical
appointment, a retrospective preintervention and postintervention analysis was used, including all patients (n = 65535) who
had scheduled appointments at 39 outpatient clinics. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was first performed. Then,
a multivariate linear regression model was used to identify factors that might predict individuals who are likely to attend
or miss their appointments and those who have a greater tendency to visit the hospital with or without appointments.
Although the average percentage of appointments attended was more than missed preintervention and postintervention, the
decrease in percentage of missed appointments was more pronounced postintervention. Also, the average percentage of
visits without appointments was less than visits with appointments in both times, but the decrease in the percentage of visits
without appointments was more prominent after. The regression analysis revealed that younger, married and male patients
were more likely to miss their appointment before and after the intervention. Also, younger patients had a tendency to
attend without appointments. Conversely, patients with the lower copayment rate had a tendency to adhere to appointment
times. In conclusion, negative reinforcement interventions could improve patient appointment adherence rates. Accordingly,
interventions designed that consider evidence and are theory-based are needed to change patient behavior.

Introduction
Over the last years, there has been revived interest in adher-
ence to medical appointments; this was strongly influenced
by the high prevalence of no-show behavior and its subse-
quent impact.1,2 No-show prevalence rates vary across health
care settings and populations. In the structured review con-
ducted by Turkcan et al,1 the mean no-show prevalence
across the 62 studies included was 23.8%, with the highest
rate occurring in North America (27.1%) and the lowest
(14.9%) in Europe, whereas the rate was 24.3% for studies
undertaken in Asia.1
No-show behavior affects all parties involved in the deliv-
ery of health care, including patients, families, providers,
and insurance agencies. For patients, missed appointments
result in poor treatment adherence, disruption of multidisci-
plinary health care, and difficulty in patient-provider rela-
tionship.3 They are also associated with increased risk of
rehospitalization,4,5 poor control of chronic conditions,3,5 and
can affect the health of other patients who lose the opportu-
nity to receive timely care.6 For health care providers, missed
appointments reduce the chance of junior physicians to learn
from different cases,7 and could lead to staff underutilization,
lower productivity, and increased costs.2,8-11
Several studies were conducted to identify the risk factors
associated with no-show behavior and characteristics of those

patients who are likely to miss their appointments. Many of
these studies reached the same conclusion that being young,
from minority racial or ethnic groups, or single, all signifi-
cantly increased the likelihood of missing appointments.12-19
Other possible predictors were insurance status, gender, lower
income, and day and time of appointment.18,19 A wide range
of reasons why patients do not adhere to their medical
appointments have also been extensively studied.
The most commonly self-reported reason for failure to
attend was that patients "forgot" their scheduled medical
appointments. This explains why reminding interventions
(ie, phone calls, mails, and SMS) have received a substantial
amount of attention, though reminders do not necessarily
change patient behavior. Other identified reasons included
lack of transportation, competing priorities with work time,
family problems, difficulties with appointment scheduling
systems, and patient's health status such as feeling better or
feeling too ill.20-22
To improve appointment adherence, several interventions
have been utilized. Common interventions include appoint-
ment reminders, cancellation policy, patient education, and
using a financial incentive.6,7,23-26 Despite the availability of
these interventions, no-show behavior remains a burden to
health care systems. Various policies have also attempted to
curb the negative consequences of no-show behavior. Such
policies include open-access or same day scheduling, follow-
up after a no-show appointment, and overbooking appoint-
ments.27-30 Although these interventions and policies have
been shown to reduce no-show rates, they are costly and
labor-intensive, and their applicability is questionable.13,31
Overbooking, for instance, increases patient wait time
and patient dissatisfaction, and might lead to work overload
at specific times.24,32 It has also been found that open-access
scheduling does not always result in a significant reduction
in no-show rates.33-35 Moreover, it is impractical to impose
financial penalties on those patients who did not attend
their scheduled appointment, as well as ethical and legal
issue. Insurance agencies such as Medicaid in the United
States do not permit health care providers to charge no-
show patients.2,20
New Intervention
Recently, on March 1, 2015, a new intervention was launched
at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAUH), which is
affiliated with the Jordan University of Science and
Technology (JUST). Instead of using financial penalties, this
intervention charges 15 Jordanian Dinars (US$21) for a visit
without an appointment. If a patient misses a scheduled
appointment, he or she has to wait a long time to reschedule
a new appointment, and may search for other ways to be seen
by doctors. Many patients try to use their social relationships
to be seen, which places a heavy burden on hospital resources.
Unscheduled appointments are considered overbooking, and
negatively affect those patients who already have a
scheduled appointment by increasing their wait time.
Unscheduled patients also burden doctors by increasing the
number of patients in the clinics, which causes doctors to
have to rearrange patient time slots for those who have
adhered to their appointments. The new policy applies to all
outpatient services, irrespective of the nature of the visit.
However, individual employees at KAUH and JUST, as well
as their dependents, are exempt from the policy.
This intervention adopted by KAUH uses negative rein-
forcement to change patient behavior. In operant condition-
ing learning theory, negative reinforcement is defined as
the removal, reduction, or escape of an unpleasant stimulus
contingent upon a behavior, which results in an increased
future rate of responding (behavior frequency).36,37 Negative
reinforcement and punishment are often confused, because
both involve the removal of an aversive stimulus. However,
they differ from each other in how response is triggered and
the effect on governing individual behavior.36,38 First, nega-
tive reinforcement entails avoiding a negative result when a
desired behavior occurs, whereas punishment implies
applying a negative consequence when undesired behavior
is exhibited.36,39 Hence, by attending scheduled appoint-
ments, patients escape the negative consequences of a visit
without an appointment. This in turn would decrease the
appointment no-show rate. Second, negative reinforcement
enhances the frequency of desired behavior, while whereas
punishment reduces undesired target behavior.36,39,40 Instead
of punishing those who do not attend their appointments,
the intervention was introduced to increase the attendance
rate.
Accordingly, the primary objective of this study is to
identify whether the implementation of "service fees" for
outpatient visits without a previously scheduled appointment
as a negative reinforcer can improve patient attendance at
scheduled appointments with the hospital. The study also
aims to identify the main predictors of no-show behavior and
visits without appointment.
Methods
Study Design and Data Collection
This is a preintervention and postintervention study41 of all
patients who had scheduled appointments from September 1,
2014, till September 1, 2015--6 months before and 6 months
after--at KAUH. KAUH is a multispecialty teaching hospi-
tal with 527 beds; it provides a wide range of health services
and is considered as a referral hospital for 4 cities in the
North of Jordan. Services provided by KAUH are in high
demand, especially the outpatient clinics, which are
renowned for their competent medical staff and availability
of advanced technology.
The data of the study were extracted retrospectively from
the database of the 39 outpatient specialist clinics at the hos-
pital. For each patient, the following data were obtained:
Alyahya et al 3
attended appointments 6 months before, missed appoint-
ments 6 months before, total appointments 6 months before,
attended appointments 6 months after, missed appointments
6 months after, and total appointments 6 months after.
Similarly, the data included numbers of total visits 6 months
before, visits with appointments 6 months before, visits
without appointments 6 months before, total visits 6 months
after, visits with appointments 6 months after, and visits
without appointments 6 months after. In addition, data on
demographic variables and patient characteristics such as fee
exemption status, patient age, gender, marital status, and
copayment status were also collected.
Ethical approval.This study received ethical approval from
the institutional review board (IRB) committee at KAUH
and JUST (No. 20160098).
Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics are reported for appointments showed
up and visits with appointments before and after the inter-
vention. As the data before and after the intervention were
observed on the same patients, a repeated-measures analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to examine the effect
of the intervention on appointment adherence and visits
without appointments. The significance of collected factors
and covariates on the probability of attending appointments
and the probability of visits with appointments was tested.
Factors considered included intervention, exemption status,
gender, marital status, and copayment.Age of the patient was
treated as a covariate.
To identify factors that may predict individuals who are
likely to miss their appointments and those who have a
greater tendency to visit the hospital without prescheduled
appointments, a multivariate linear regression model was
used to relate the probability of adherence to appointments
and probability of visits with appointments to the significant
factors found in the repeated-measures ANOVA. The analy-
sis was performed using SPSS 20.0.
Results
A total of 65535 patients who had scheduled appointments
during the study period were identified. The mean age of
included patients was 36 (SD = 21) years of whom 37
487
were females (57.2%), 36
541 were married (55.8%), and
7431 of them had exemption (11.3%). Table 1 shows that the
mean percentage of missed appointments decreased from
45.12% during the preintervention period to 41.27% during
the postintervention period. This difference reflected a reduc-
tion of 8.53% and was statistically significant (P < .001).
Interestingly, the mean percentage of visits without appoint-
ments reduced by 38.64% (P < .001), from 30.61% to 18.78%
postintervention.
Effect of the Intervention on Appointment
Adherence and Visits With Appointments
Based on the patients' characteristics, means and SDs for
percentages of attended appointments and percentages of
visits with appointments before and after the intervention
are shown in Table 2. A repeated-measures ANOVA with
intervention (before and after the intervention) as within-
subjects factor and gender (male, female), marital status
(single, married), exemption status (yes [with], no [with-
out]), and copayment group (groups1 through 4) as
between-subjects along with patient age as a covariate was
conducted. Two response variables were considered; the
first was the probability of a show-up in an appointment
calculated as the percentage of appointments the patient
showed up of the total appointments (Table 3). The second
response variable was the probability of a visit with appoint-
ment obtained as the percentage of visits with appointments
of the total visits (Table 4).
For the probability of a show-up in an appointment,
ANOVA results revealed that intervention (P < .001), age
(P = .018), gender (P < .001), and copayment (P < .001)
were the significant factors along with the 2-factor interac-
tions: Intervention × Age (P < .001), Intervention ×
Copayment (P = .002), Gender × Copayment (P < .001), and
Marital status × Copayment (P = .004). Exemption status
was a marginally significant factor with a P value of .093.
For the probability of visits with appointment, the effect
of intervention (P < .001), age (P < .001), gender (P < .001),
marital status (P < .001), and copayment (P < .001) were all
significant. The following 2-factor interactions were also
significant: Intervention × Gender (P = .051), Intervention ×
Copayment (P < .001), Gender × Copayment (P = .056),

Predictors of Appointment Adherence and Visits
With/Without Appointments 6 Months Before
and 6 Months After
To mathematically identify the size of the effect for the sig-
nificant factors found in the ANOVA, multiple linear regres-
sion was utilized to build models that relate probability of
show-up in appointments and probability of visits with
appointments to their predictors. Table 5 shows the estimated
regression parameters along with their 95% confidence inter-
vals (CIs). Based on the parameter estimates, we found that
female patients had a higher probability of adherence to
appointments than males, with increased probability after the
intervention. In contrast, married patients were more likely
to miss their appointments than single patients. Married
patients have shown a slight improvement in the adherence
after the intervention. Among copayment groups, group 3
patients had the lowest probability of adherence compared
with other groups (before and after). This means that patients
within the lower range of copayment rate had a tendency to
attend their appointments. However, all groups have shown a
significant increased probability of adherence after the inter-
vention. Patients with no exemption have shown a slightly
reduced probability of adherence to appointments after the
intervention compared with that before the intervention. The
results also indicated that older patients had a tendency to
attend appointments, particularly after the intervention.
In concordance with the above findings, female patients
had a higher probability of visits with appointments than
male patients. Also, the probability of visits with appoint-
ments for married patients has improved after the interven-
tion. Patients with the lower copayment rates were less likely
to attend without previous appointment, whereas younger
patients were much more likely to attend without appoint-
ments. Finally, a substantial improvement in the probability
of visits with appointment has been achieved after the inter-
vention for patients with no exemption.
Discussion
Appointment adherence is a health behavior that remains a
challenge for health care systems because of its detrimental
effects on patient treatment and outcomes.3-5 However,
appointment adherence has received little attention as a
behavioral issue, compared with, for example, treatment
adherence, or immunization uptake.42
This study examined whether an intervention implement-
ing fees for unscheduled visits would result in improving
appointment adherence. Although reducing visits without
appointments has been an objective of the intervention, the
ultimate aim is to increase the rate of appointment adher-
ence. The study found that the mean percentage of visits
without appointments decreased significantly from 30.61%
to 18.78%, and that the mean percentage of the no-show rate
dropped from 45.12% to 41.27% after the introduction of the
intervention. In addition, our results demonstrated that both
visits with appointments and attended appointments have
improved after introducing the new intervention.
Although there are a number of other interventions that
have been shown to decrease the rates of no-show behavior,
these interventions may have limited impact and lead to

dysfunctional consequences. For instance, overbooking and
open-access policies might increase the risk of overloading
the schedules of health care providers, which requires careful
observation and management, and accurate prediction of
demand.24,43 In addition, many previously discussed inter-
ventions have only been used in research studies, and have
not necessarily been applied in health care facilities, or used
to motivate individuals to change their behavior.24,26,44,45
Nonetheless, the effectiveness of using financial incen-
tives (rewards/penalties) in changing individual behavior has
been theoretically substantiated and empirically supported in
different health care settings.46,47 In a recent study, Kubanek
et al38 tried to address whether Thorndike's law of effect is
symmetric or qualitatively distinct in regard to monetary rein-
forcement and punishment. They found that reinforcement
and punishment play a distinct role in guiding individual

behavior. Punitive policies might be effective in reducing the
no-show rate but are difficult to implement and can affect
access to health care service, particularly among those
patients with limited income.17 Also, it might be unfair to
charge those who had inevitable reason for not attending.2,13,48
In their qualitative study, Martin et al20 argue that imposing
financial penalties would have some effect in reducing missed
appointments but would not be significant; furthermore, it
might be not acceptable to providers to fine nonattending
patients. In addition, such policies might encourage patients
to cancel or reschedule their appointments.49
Instead of fining those patients who missed their scheduled
appointment, KAUH introduced the "service fees" as a nega-
tive reinforce to those who want visits without appointments.

Thus, if the patient attends his or her scheduled appointment,
he or she will not need to pay for a visit without appointment.
In addition, negative reinforcement enhances the frequency of
desired behavior, whereas punishment reduces undesired tar-
get behavior.36,39,40 In this regard, the main reason for the inter-
vention is increasing the rate of appointment attendance rather
than punishing those who do not adhere to their scheduled
appointments.
Identifying the main characteristics associated with
appointment adherence can also inform the development
of interventions to reduce the occurrence of no-show
behavior.19 Our results confirm what has been previously
found that younger patients are more likely to no-show than
older patients.17-19 Older adults have more chronic conditions
and long-term illnesses and missing scheduled appointments
could adversely affect their health. They are more attentive
to their health, and have enough free time compared with
young adults.26 Moreover, and in accordance with several
previous studies,14-16 this study showed that male patients
were more likely to no-show to their appointments before
and after the intervention, though this has not been found
consistently.1,50,51 Some previous studies also indicated that
being married is associated with a low no-show rate,1,17 while
we found that single patients were more likely to attend their
appointments. Singles usually have less family commitments
and it is easier for them to manage their time. Interestingly,
having full insurance coverage was found to be significantly
associated with a tendency to attend appointments. A possi-
ble explanation is that most patients with 0% copayment had
government insurance and were referred from other govern-
ment hospitals, or they had full insurance coverage from the
Royal Court or from other agencies. However, in both cases,
full coverage is usually time limited. So, such patients try to
enjoy the greatest possible benefits, especially as most of the
patients are from lower income families.
Finally, there are other patient characteristics and predis-
posing factors that have been identified in previous studies as
potential influences on patient adherence to prescheduled
appointments including health status, income, and race and
ethnicity.1,52 However, as most inhabitants in Jordan are
Arabs, Jordanian ethnicity and culture are characterized by
uniformity and there are no racial and ethnic differences in

Jordan. Other factors such as health status (chronic vs. acute)
could also influence adherence to appointment. Chronic dis-
ease patients might be more apt to attend their appointments
than patients with acute illnesses, because patients with
chronic diseases usually have a good relationship with their
caregivers, and they are more compliant with their treatment
plan.1,17 In addition, the severity of health conditions might
be associated with adherence to appointments; for instance,
it has been shown that more ill patients are less likely to miss
their appointments.1,17 Therefore, it is worthy to consider and
examine the effect of these factors in future works to predict
and improve appointment adherence.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the ability of negative reinforce-
ment to modify patient behavior and increase patient
appointment adherence rates. Appointment adherence
enhances the efficacy of health services. Besides using the
scheduled appointment to provide adequate and timely
patient care, health care settings maximize the utilization of
existing resources. The study also highlights that develop-
ing an effective and socially appropriate intervention that
could improve appointment attendance requires a clear
explanation of the impact of such interventions from theo-
retical perspectives. Hence, health managers and policy
makers need to consider evidence and theory-based inter-
ventions that go beyond merely the managerial practical
issues. Further studies should focus on the empirical link
between theory and practice in governing patient adherence
behavior. Finally, we expect that visits without appoint-
ments and no-show rates could be further reduced than our
reported results if the intervention is continued, as the cur-
rent study examined impact only in the first 6 months of
implementation.
