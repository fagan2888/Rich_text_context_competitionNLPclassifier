Criminal-Justice and School Sanctions Against
Nonheterosexual Youth: A National Longitudinal Study
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Nonheterosexual youth are
vulnerable to a variety of health risks. In addition, anecdotal
reports have suggested that they may be overrepresented among
adolescents who have received a variety of institutional
sanctions.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This is the first study to use a
nationally representative, population-based sample to document
that nonheterosexual youth, particularly girls, have greater odds
than their peers of experiencing school and criminal-justice
sanctions.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: Nonheterosexual adolescents are vulnerable to health
risks including addiction, bullying, and familial abuse. We examined
whether they also suffer disproportionate school and criminal-justice
sanctions.
METHODS: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health fol-
lowed a nationally representative sample of adolescents who were in
grades 7 through 12 in 1994­1995. Data from the 1994­1995 survey
and the 2001­2002 follow-up were analyzed. Three measures were
used to assess nonheterosexuality: same-sex attraction, same-sex ro-
mantic relationships, and lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) self-
identification. Six outcomes were assessed: school expulsion; police
stops; juvenile arrest; juvenile conviction; adult arrest; and adult con-
viction. Multivariate analyses controlled for adolescents' sociodemo-
graphics and behaviors, including illegal conduct.
RESULTS: Nonheterosexuality consistently predicted a higher risk for
sanctions. For example, in multivariate analyses, nonheterosexual ad-
olescents had greater odds of being stopped by the police (odds ratio:
1.38 [P  .0001] for same-sex attraction and 1.53 [P  .0001] for LGB
self-identification). Similar trends were observed for school expulsion,
juvenile arrest and conviction, and adult conviction. Nonheterosexual
girls were at particularly high risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Nonheterosexual youth suffer disproportionate ed-
ucational and criminal-justice punishments that are not explained
by greater engagement in illegal or transgressive behaviors. Un-
derstanding and addressing these disparities might reduce school
expulsions, arrests, and incarceration and their dire social and
health consequences. Pediatrics 2011;127:49­57

Nonheterosexual adolescents often
face discrimination. At home, some
nonheterosexual adolescents experi-
ence verbal and physical abuse; 26%
of nonheterosexual children leave
their families because of conflicts
over sexual orientation, and many
become homeless.1,2 Thirty percent
suffer family violence after "coming
out."1 Harassment by peers is also
common.3­10
It is not surprising that nonhetero-
sexual adolescents experience high
rates of depression and sui-
cide.3,9,11­13 In addition, they are
more likely than other adolescents to
engage in high-risk sexual and
substance-use behaviors, to carry
weapons (often as a precaution
against assault), and to engage in
petty survival crimes because of home-
lessness.2,3,5,11,14­19 These activities
place nonheterosexual adolescents at
risk for school and criminal-justice
sanctions. Nonheterosexual youth also
are more likely than their peers to be
referred to courts by their families
through PINS (Person in Need of Super-
vision) or CHINS (Child in Need of Su-
pervision) petitions.8 In addition, con-
sensual same-sex sexual acts more
often trigger punishments than equiv-
alent opposite-sex behaviors.8,19,20 In-
deed, until the Supreme Court's 2003
ruling in Lawrence et al v Texas,20
states could legally prosecute same-
sex couples for consensual sexual
acts. Anecdotal reports5,21 have sug-
gested that nonheterosexual girls may
be particularly overrepresented in
the juvenile-justice system. Scholars
have suggested that the overrepresen-
tation of nonheterosexual girls may re-
late to the historical role of the
juvenile-justice system in policing
girls' sexuality,22 as well as a height-
ened juvenile-justice system and me-
dia opprobrium directed at girls with
"aggressive" or "masculine" gender
presentations.23
To our knowledge, no previous studies
have examined whether nonhetero-
sexual youth are overrepresented
among those who have received
school and criminal-justice sanctions
nationally. Using data from the Na-
tional Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health), we examined this
question after controlling for trans-
gressive and illegal behaviors.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
Add Health, conducted by the Caro-
lina Population Center, consists of
repeated surveys of a nationally rep-
resentative sample of youth who
were in grades 7 through 12 during
the 1994­1995 school year. The sam-
pling frame was school based; all
students who were listed on selected
school rosters were eligible, and
there was oversampling of some
groups. In total, 20 747 adolescents
participated in the wave 1 in-home
interviews. Special techniques, in-
cluding the use of individual head-
sets and direct entry of answers into
laptop computers, were developed to
elicit sensitive information. In 1996,
Add Health wave 2 resurveyed 14 738
wave 1 participants.
Wave 3 of Add Health, conducted in
2001­2002 when the respondents
were aged 18 to 26 years, included
15 170 wave 1 respondents. In addition
to questions originally asked during
wave 1, wave 3 respondents were
asked about their criminal-justice con-
tacts. Wave 3 excluded subjects who
were outside the United States, but ef-
forts were made to recontact incarcer-
ated subjects. Our analysis included
15 170 people who participated in both
waves 1 and 3.24 Sensitivity analyses
were performed only using data on ado-
lescents who participated in waves 1
through 3. Yale University's institutional
review board approved this research.
Measures: Predictor Variables
Researchers commonly recognize at-
traction, behavior, and identity as 3
components of sexual orientation and
have noted the importance of examin-
ing all 3 of them.25,26 Attraction consists
of desires and fantasies; behavior con-
sists of sexual activities that involve
physical contact and sexual arousal;
and identity involves the labels and
meanings that individuals attach to
their own sexualities.27
The Add Health surveys included ques-
tions that assess all 3 components. In
all waves participants were asked,
"Have you ever had a romantic attrac-
tion to a male?" and "Have you ever had
a romantic attraction to a female?" Re-
spondents who reported an attraction
to a person of their own gender in ei-
ther wave were considered to have ex-
perienced same-sex attraction. In addi-
tion, participants in all 3 waves were
asked to describe their romantic and
sexual relationships, including their
partners' genders. Respondents who
listed a same-sex relationship in either
study wave were considered to have
had a same-sex relationship. In wave
3 only, respondents were asked,
"Choose the description that best fits
how you think about yourself" (re-
sponse options: 100% heterosexual
[straight], mostly heterosexual
[straight] but somewhat attracted to
people of your own gender, bisexual--
that is, attracted to men and women
equally, mostly homosexual [gay] but
somewhat attracted to people of the
opposite gender, 100% homosexual
[gay], and not sexually attracted to ei-
ther males or females [the few adoles-
cents who selected this last option
were excluded]). For the main analy-
ses, sample-size considerations dic-
tated that self-identification be
specified dichotomously as 100% het-
erosexual versus other than 100% het-
erosexual. In this article we refer to all
youth in the latter category as lesbian,
50 HIMMELSTEIN and BRÜCKNER
gay, or bisexual (LGB). The broader
term "nonheterosexual" is used to in-
dicate any youth who self-identified as
LGB or who affirmed a same-sex at-
traction or relationship.
The variety of answers given to these
questions illustrates the complexity
and fluidity of adolescents' sexual ori-
entations.28 Of Add Health respondents
who indicated same-sex attraction in
wave 1, only 27% reported such attrac-
tion in wave 3. In wave 1, only 9% of
respondents who indicated a same-sex
attraction reported a same-sex rela-
tionship. In addition, 28% of respon-
dents who experienced a same-sex re-
lationship self-identified as entirely
heterosexual. For this analysis, each
component (attraction, relationship,
and self-identification) was modeled
separately. In addition, supplemental
bivariate models were created to ex-
amine adolescents who might be
"questioning," as defined by self-
reporting same-sex attraction while
self-identifying as 100% heterosexual.
With other supplemental bivariate
models we examined each self-
identification category separately.
Transgressive Behavior and Other
Control Variables
Because nonheterosexual adolescents
engage in high rates of some trans-
gressive behaviors, and each instance
of such behaviors represents an expo-
sure to the risk of sanction, control for
these behaviors was necessary to elu-
cidate the impact of sexual orientation,
per se. Add Health asked questions
about behaviors in the following form:
"In the past 12 months, how often did
you X?" Responses were coded as 0 for
never, 1 for 1 to 2 times, 2 for 3 to 4
times, and 3 for 5 or more times.
For the current analysis, 3 indices
were created to summarize transgres-
sive behaviors. One index, "minor
transgressions," summed responses
to questions regarding low-risk misbe-
haviors such as running away, lying to
parents about whereabouts, shoplift-
ing, getting drunk, graffiti-writing, van-
dalism, and public rowdiness. The re-
sulting index ranged from 0 to 21. A
second index, "moderate transgres-
sions," was based on responses to 5
questions regarding stealing objects
worth less or more than $50, selling
drugs, driving a car without the own-
er's permission, and burglary. The re-
sulting index ranged from 0 to 15. A
final index, "violent behavior," summed
responses regarding physical fighting,
injuring someone, using or threaten-
ing someone with a weapon, and par-
ticipating in a group fight. The result-
ing index ranged from 0 to 12. In total, 9
transgressive-behavior indices were
created, 3 for each study wave. The
main models included only wave 1 indi-
ces to minimize endogeneity (ie, the ten-
dency of sanctions to worsen an adoles-
cent's behavior); sensitivity analyses
included all 9 indices in the models.
In addition to behavior, models con-
trolled for age, gender, self-identified
race/ethnicity (white, black, Latino,
and other) and family socioeconomic
status, as modeled by a 10-level com-
posite index based on income, occupa-
tion, and parental education.29
Outcomes: Institutional Sanctions
Add Health included detailed questions
about school expulsions and criminal-
justice contacts, which were summa-
rized into 6 outcomes:
1. ever expelled from school;
2. ever stopped by police;
3. ever arrested before the age of 18;
4. ever convicted (or pled guilty) in ju-
venile court;
5. ever arrested after turning 18; and
6. ever convicted (or pled guilty) in
adult court.
Although Add Health attempted to lo-
cate wave 1 participants who were in-
carcerated during wave 3, it seems
likely (on the basis of the low reported
incarceration rate) that incarcerated
youth were undersampled.30 Table 1
summarizes all variables modeled.
Statistical Analysis
Stata/SE 10 for Windows, was used for
all analyses.31 Bivariate relationships
between the 3 measures of nonhetero-
sexuality (attraction, relationship, and
LGB self-identification) and the 6 insti-
tutional sanctions were examined by
using 2 tests.
Eighteen sets of logistic regression
models were constructed to examine
the relationships between each of the
3 measures of nonheterosexuality and
each of the 6 sanctions while control-
ling for sociodemographic factors and
misbehaviors. Each set of models was
constructed first for the entire sample
and then according to gender. Sepa-
rate models were not constructed for
race or socioeconomic status sub-
groups because of sample size. All
analyses were corrected for sampling
probabilities and clustering. Because
of multiple testing, findings with P val-
ues between .05 and .001 are de-
scribed as showing a trend and should
be interpreted cautiously; only find-
ings with a P value of .001 were
deemed statistically significant. Re-
sults for cells that contained fewer
than 10 respondents are not reported.
RESULTS
Of 15 170 respondents who provided
data for both the wave 1 and 3 surveys,
13.4% of male and 17.1% of female re-
spondents reported same-sex attrac-
tion, 4.8% of male and 6.2% of female
respondents reported same-sex rela-
tionships, and 5.6% of male and 14.5%
of female respondents self-identified
as LGB (ie, other than 100% heterosex-
ual). Male subjects were more likely to
respond that they were either 100%
homosexual or 100% heterosexual,

whereas female subjects more often
self-identified in middle categories.
Transgressive behavior was common
among all respondents; 76% reported
minor transgressions, 30% reported
moderate transgressions, and 41% re-
ported violent behavior. Nonhetero-
sexual adolescents engaged in more
minor and moderate transgressions
but not violence. Adolescents who
were attracted to the same sex aver-
aged 3.60 on the minor-transgression
scale (vs 2.84 for other adolescents;
P  .0001), 1.03 on the moderate-
transgression scale (vs 0.71 for other
adolescents; P  .0001), and 1.08 on
the violence scale (vs 0.98 for other ad-
olescents; P  .11). Respondents who
were involved in same-sex relation-
ships tended to report more minor
transgressions (scaled score: 3.72 vs
3.14 for other adolescents; P  .004)
but not more moderate transgres-
sions (1.03 vs 0.83; P  .07) or violent
behavior (1.19 vs 1.10; P  .06). Re-
spondents who self-identified as LGB
averaged higher on the minor-
transgression scale (3.71 vs 2.84 for
their peers; P  .0001) and on the
moderate-transgression scale (1.00 vs
0.70; P  .0001) but showed a trend
toward less violence (0.85 vs 1.00; P 
.02). Supplemental models of misbe-
haviors according to detailed self-
identification category appear in Ap-
pendix 1. As seen in previous studies,32
male adolescents exhibited more
transgressive behaviors than female
adolescents (details available from the
authors).
Bivariate Results
Table 2 presents bivariate relation-
ships between the 3 nonheterosexual-
ity indicators and the 6 sanctions.
Youth who indicated same-sex attrac-
tion or relationships showed a trend
toward greater sanctions in 12 of 36
comparisons. In contrast, sanction
rates among self-identified LGB youth
differed according to gender. Only self-
identified LGB female subjects consis-
tently experienced significantly more
sanctions, and LGB male subjects
showed a trend toward lower rates
of school expulsion.
Using supplemental bivariate analyses
we explored alternative specifications
of the self-identification variable. First,
each detailed self-identification cate-
gory was analyzed and gave varying re-
sults for different sanctions (Appendix
2). Then, the definition of LGB was iter-
atively expanded from 100% homosex-
ual by adding each of the 3 middle cat-
egories between 100% homosexual
and 100% heterosexual (data not
shown). The trend of these iterative
analyses was consistent: LGB identity
predicted greater sanctions relative to
100% heterosexual in all 4 of the valid
models (P  .05). Finally, to explore
questioning, data from adolescents
who reported a same-sex attraction
but self-identified as 100% hetero-
sexual were analyzed (Appendix 3);
these youth seemed to be at elevated
risk of all sanctions except adult
arrest. Because of the sample size,
neither multivariate nor gender-
stratified models were possible for
alternate specifications of the self-
identification variable.
Multivariate Results
The association between nonhetero-
sexuality and elevated risk of sanc-
tions persisted in the multivariate
models (Table 3). In all 18 primary
models, the odds ratio (OR) for each
indicator of nonheterosexuality (at-
traction, relationship, and self-
identification) exceeded 1.0, al-
though many of these ORs were
nonsignificant.
Both same-sex attraction and LGB
self-identification were significantly
associated with police stops,
whereas same-sex relationship
showed a similar trend. In addition,
youth who experienced same-sex at-
traction showed a trend toward
more school expulsion and adult con-
victions (OR: 1.4).

Self-identification as LGB showed a
trend toward higher odds of all sanc-
tions except school expulsion and
adult arrest. This result was surpris-
ing, because of the 3 nonheterosexual-
ity indicators, LGB self-identification
showed the weakest bivariate relation-
ship with sanctions. The stronger
multivariate association may have
emerged because of control for violent
behavior.
As in the bivariate models, there were
some gender differences. Nonhetero-
sexuality showed a trend toward
higher odds of sanctions in 8 of 18
stratified models for female subjects
but in only 2 of 18 for male subjects.

traction and sanctions seemed stron-

approached 2.0). The association be-
tween same-sex relationships and
sanctions did not vary according to
gender. Self-identification as LGB
showed the same gendered associa-
tion with sanctions as those in the bi-
variate models. Female subjects, but
not male subjects, who self-identified
as LGB had very high odds of experi-
encing most sanctions.
DISCUSSION
These findings suggest that nonhetero-
sexual adolescents, particularly girls,
suffer punishments by school and
criminal-justice authorities that are
disproportionate to their rates of
transgressive behavior. Although the
results of some small surveys and eth-
nographic studies have suggested
an overrepresentation of nonhetero-
sexual adolescents among those who
received various sanctions,1,5,8,13,19,21
ours is the first documentation of this
phenomenon in a nationally represen-
tative, population-based sample.
Overall, nonheterosexual adolescents
had between 1.25 and 3 times greater
odds than their heterosexual peers of
experiencing sanction, depending on
the indicator of nonheterosexuality
and the sanction examined. This ele-
vated risk was present for boys and
girls who indicated same-sex attrac-
tion and same-sex relationships and
for girls who self-identified as LGB,
even after controlling for nonhetero-
sexual youths' greater engagement in
minor and moderate transgressive be-
haviors (nonheterosexual youth do not
engage in more violent behaviors than
their peers).
As in other studies,33 self-identification
patterns differed according to gender;
more male subjects identified as 100%
heterosexual or 100% homosexual,
whereas more female subjects se-
lected middle categories. The re-
sponse patterns of female study par-
ticipants were concordant with
Diamond's34,35 findings that many
young women's sexualities are fluid
and not amenable to rigid classifica-
tion. The current analysis revealed
additional gender differences in
sanction disparities; nonhetero-
sexual girls were at particularly high
risk. In addition, it seems that youth
who question their sexuality may be
at especially high risk for sanctions,
although sample-size limitations
precluded detailed exploration of
this hypothesis.
There are several potential explana-
tions for our findings. Institutional
decision-makers may focus on nonhet-
erosexual youth for punishment for
sexual or other behaviors or be less
likely to consider mitigating factors
such as immaturity or self-defense. In-
deed, teachers often overlook harass-
ment of nonheterosexual students by
their peers, and youth who report such
abuse are frequently ignored or
blamed for their victimization.3,6,10 In
addition, nonheterosexual youth some-
times encounter homophobia in health
care and child welfare systems.1,36,37
Thus, nonheterosexual youth who are
harassed or engage in risky behaviors
may find that instead of support, ther-
apy, or services, their behaviors elicit
punishment.
Alternatively, unmeasured confound-
ers, such as misbehaviors not cap-
tured in Add Health, might drive the ob-
served associations. Of particular
concern are youth who might report
nonheterosexuality as part of a broad
pattern of defiant behavior. Although
possible, such confounding seems un-
likely. Multivariate models controlled
for a variety of transgressive behav-
iors, including those in which nonhet-
erosexual youth tend to engage. More-
over, in sensitivity analyses that
included additional behavior controls
constructed from waves 2 and 3, ORs
closely resembled those in the princi-
pal analyses, although missing data
reduced the sample size by 27%, which
precluded subgroup analysis (results
available from the authors).
Residual confounding according to be-
havior might occur if nonheterosexual
respondents were more reluctant
than others to report transgressive
behaviors. However, because nonhet-
erosexuality was determined accord-
ing to self-report, youth who self-
identified as nonheterosexual were, by
definition, willing to report at least
some sensitive personal information.
A similar willingness among other re-
spondents cannot be assumed. Al-
though incarceration might be thought
to encourage same-sex sexual behav-
ior, incarceration was much too rare
in the sample to explain the results.
The broad definition of nonheterosexu-
ality captured adolescents who self-
identified as heterosexual but experi-
enced occasional same-sex attraction
or relationships. Arguably, however,
this makes the findings stronger be-
cause of the suggestion that mere ex-
ploration of nonheterosexuality, re-
gardless of self-identification, places
youth at risk for sanctions.
The fact that nonheterosexual youth
are more likely than other adolescents
to run away from home2 suggests that
they may be overrepresented among
the 5577 subjects lost from the sample
between waves 1 and 3. If runaway
youth are more likely to experience
sanctions, the lost subjects may have
made the conclusions of this analysis
overly conservative. College atten-
dance is another possible confounder;
some, but not all, reports have sug-
gested that low education attainment
is associated with heterosexuality.38
However, Add Health's methods make
it unlikely that college students would
be selectively lost to follow-up.
A final limitation is the distortion that
may have resulted from multiple test-
ing. However, the number of ORs with a
P value of .05 was high (8 of 18 for
54 HIMMELSTEIN and BRÜCKNER
the overall population), and many
findings were significant at P  .001
or greater. In addition, although the
overall sample size was large
(100 000 person-years of observa-
tion), the relatively small numbers of
respondents who experienced sanc-
tions and indicated nonheterosexu-
ality limited the study power.
Sample-size limitations also pre-
cluded the analysis of racial sub-
groups; nonwhite adolescents repre-
sent an important group for future
study, given their overrepresen-
tation among those receiving
sanctions.39
Add Health lacks reliable information
about gender identity. The wave 3 sur-
vey included questions from the Bem
Sex-Role Inventory, which was de-
signed to elicit gender identity by ask-
ing respondents to affirm statements
such as "I love children." Unfortu-
nately, the Bem Inventory correlates
poorly with gender self-identification40
and, hence, was not analyzed. Because
many nonheterosexual people are
gender-nonconforming,41 however, the
results of this study suggest that non-
normative gender identity might con-
tribute to sanction disparities. Indeed,
results of qualitative studies have sug-
gested that transgendered individuals
are at particular risk of discrimination
and victimization within the school and
criminal-justice systems.19,21
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings indicate that nonhetero-
sexual adolescents suffer dispropor-
tionate punishments by schools and
the criminal-justice system, which im-
plicates not only schools, police, and
courts but also other youth-serving
health and welfare systems that often
fail to meet the needs of nonhetero-
sexual adolescents. Thus, our results
suggest an urgent need for all child-
serving professionals to reflect on
strategies to reduce the criminaliza-
tion of nonheterosexual youth as they
navigate adolescence in an often hos-
tile society.

DRINKING WATER: We have two cats and a dog in the house. We always know
when the dog is drinking water because we can hear her lapping and splashing
water onto the floor. Catching the cats drinking is much harder. I never hear
them, and they don't seem to create a mess. According to an article on New
YorkTimes.com (November 11, 2010:1­3), there is good reason why they are so
neat. Neither dogs nor cats can create suction so they must use an alternative
way to get water into their mouths. Dogs create a shallow cup with the tip of
their tongue which is pulled up into the mouth. Cats on the other hand, use
surface tension to create a mound of water. Using high speed cameras, engi-
neers discovered that cats insert their tongue into the water but just barely. The
tongue is then withdrawn at rapid speed creating and pulling a column of water
behind it. Cats seem to know exactly when the force of gravity will overcome the
surface tension that created the column. At that exact instant, the cat closes his
or her jaws around the column of water and swallows. All this takes place four
times per second, too fast for the human eye to see. Engineers went on to create
a mechanical model of this mechanism to calculate the optimal rate at which
cats should be lapping water to get the most water into their mouth. Cats, it
seems, are good engineers as they lap at the exact speed needed to maximize
drinking. While the equation for optimal lapping frequency (weight raised to the
power of minus one-sixth and multiplied by 4.6) is not taught in high schools, all
cats seem to know it as studies showed that house cats as well as lions, leop-
ards, and jaguars all lap at this speed. The next time I see Ingrid at the water
bowl, I will have to admire her remarkable skills.
