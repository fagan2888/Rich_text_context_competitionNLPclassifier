Objectives. The purpose of this study was to see if support provided and received from fellow church members reduced
the deleterious effects of financial strain on mortality in late life.
Methods. Interviews were conducted with a nationwide sample of 1,500 older adults in 2001 and 2004. Participants
were asked in 2001 about financial strain, church-based social support, and a range of private and public religious
practices. Mortality status was determined at the follow-up interview in 2004.
Results. The findings indicated that providing social support to fellow church members reduced the effects of support
providers' own financial problems on mortality. In contrast, the data suggested that receiving support from people at
church did not have the same stress-buffering effect.
Discussion. Finding ways to help older adults become more involved in providing support to others at church may
form the basis for developing interventions aimed at improving their quality of life.
A GROWING number of studies suggest that greater in-
volvement in religion is associated with better physical and
mental health (Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Some of the
most compelling evidence for these findings comes from studies
that use mortality as an outcome. This body of work suggests that
people who attend religious services on a regular basis are less
likely to die over the study follow-up period than individuals who
do not attend worship services on a regular basis (e.g., Hummer,
Rogers, Nam, & Ellison, 1999). Although this research has made
a major contribution to the literature, it is difficult to know what the
study findings mean, because attending religious services is
a complex construct that encompasses a number of different
attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. For example, when people attend
worship services, they often pray, engage in rituals, interact with
their fellow congregationalists, listen to sermons, and participate
in the singing of religious hymns. Any--or all--of these factors
might explain the relationship between attending worship services
and mortality. Because providing a credible explanation is an
important criterion for establishing causality (Bradley & Schaefer,
1998), it is imperative that researchers strive to identify the
underlying factor(s) that are at work.
Researchers have conducted a small cluster of studies in an
attempt to explain the relationship between the frequency of
attending religious services and mortality, but these efforts have
been largely unsuccessful. For example, Musick, House, and
Williams (2004) examined the effect of attending religious
services on mortality after controlling for a number of factors,
including health behaviors, social interaction, and several indi-
cators of subjective religiousness. They reported that the impact of
attending worship services on mortality remained largely un-
changed after they had taken into account the effects of these
mediating variables (see also Ellison, Hummer, Cormier, &
Rogers, 2000). This suggests that researchers have yet to evaluate
empirically the core aspects of religious attendance that are
responsible for the lower mortality risk. The purpose of the present
study was to see if church-based social support may help explain
the link between attendance at worship services and mortality in
late life.
There are at least three reasons why it is important to focus
specifically on church-based social support. First, a number of the
grand masters in sociology, psychology, psychiatry, and philoso-
phy have argued that social relationships lie at the very heart of
religion. For example, Georg Simmel (1898/1977), a classic
sociologist, maintained that ``The faith that has come to be
regarded as the essence and substance of religion is first of all
a relationship between human beings . . .'' (p. 108, emphasis in the
original). Josiah Royce was a well-known philosopher of his time
and a close personal friend of William James. Royce wrote
a volume in 1912 in order to overcome what he felt were serious
oversights in James's classic treatise on religion, The Varieties of
Religious Experience (1902/1997). Chief among these oversights
was the emphasis placed by James on the role of unconscious
processes in the genesis of religious feelings and religious insights.
Royce maintained that instead of arising from within the
individual, the impetus for religious experiences and sentiments
was decidedly social in nature. More specifically, he argued that
``. . . our social experience is our primary source of religious
insight. And the salvation that this insight brings to our knowledge
is salvation through the fostering of human brotherhood. Such
salvation accrues to the individual so far as he gives himself over to
the service of man'' (Royce, 1912/2001, p. 58).
The empirical work of contemporary researchers points to the
second reason why it is important to study church-based social
support. Levin (2001) summarized this research when he set out
to explain why more frequent attendance at religious services is
associated with better health. He concluded, ``I believe that
supportive relationships provided through religious fellowship best
explains the findings we have examined'' (p. 58). Research by
Ellison and George (1994) helps show why this may be so. These
investigators maintained that social relationships in religious com-
munities are more extensive, denser, and more satisfying than
social relationships in the secular world. Presumably, greater social
cohesiveness in religious institutions arises in part from shared
religious beliefs. In particular, the tenets of every major religion
encourage people to love one another, take care of those who are in
need, and forgive other people for the things they have done.
Secular research on interpersonal ties points to the third reason
why it is important to focus on social relationships in religious
institutions. This vast body of work indicates that people who
maintain strong ties with others tend to enjoy better physical and

mental health than individuals who are not tightly integrated into
a supportive social network (Cohen, 2004).
Some investigators have examined the impact of social rela-
tionships on mortality in an effort to see if these relationships help
explain the influence of attending worship services on mortality
(e.g., Musick et al., 2004). But they have been unable to find that
social relationships are an important mediating factor. In fact,
Musick and colleagues reported that more social support from
family and friends is actually associated with an increased
mortality risk. The authors explained this unanticipated finding
by suggesting that people who have poor health consequently
receive more assistance from members of their social network.
Although this is certainly possible, there is another way to think
about their results.
Researchers have known for some time that support from
significant others helps older adults cope more effectively with the
deleterious effects of stress (Krause, 2001). Consequently, the best
model may be one in which researchers see if church-based support
offsets, or moderates, the noxious effects of stress on mortality. It
may be especially important to evaluate this type of specification
when trying to explain the effects of attending worship services,
because researchers have argued for decades that one of the
primary functions of religion is to help people deal with adversity.
For example, writing nearly 80 years ago, Cooley (1927, p. 254)
noted that religion ``. . . often exists without our being aware of it,
until some crisis brings it out'' (see also Pargament, 1997).
Based on this rationale, the first goal of the present study was to
test the following hypothesis: Church-based social support will
offset the pernicious effects of stress on mortality in late life.
Although this appears to be the first time that a researcher has
examined the relationships among these constructs in the literature,
these analyses may not go far enough.
In order to see what needs to be done, it is helpful to return to
Royce's (1912/2001) quotation. He maintained that ``. . . salvation
accrues to the individual so far as he gives himself over to the
service of man'' (p. 58). Simply put, this observation suggests that
the benefits of religion may arise not from receiving support, but
from providing it to others. A small but growing cluster of studies
conducted in secular settings tends to support Royce's views. In the
process, these studies help extend research on helping others into
the health arena. More specifically, this research suggests that
helping others tends to enhance the health and psychological well-
being of older support providers (e.g., Krause, Herzog, & Baker,
1992).
In his widely cited paper on helping behavior, Reissman (1965)
provided three reasons why support providers benefit from giving
assistance to those in need. First, Reissman argued that helping
other people enhances the self-esteem of the support provider.
Providing assistance to those who are less fortunate makes a clear
and unambiguous statement about the support provider because it
highlights basic aspects of his or her character that are admired
widely in American culture. This is an important consideration
when a support provider is grappling with his or her own diffi-
culties because a number of studies suggest that stress operates, in
part, by reducing feelings of self-worth in late life (Krause &
Borawski-Clark, 1994). Second, Reissman maintained that helping
others provides a psychological respite from the support provider's
own difficulties: It shifts the focus away from the self and the
problems one often wrestles with. This is noteworthy because
being able to temporarily escape one's own problems may have
beneficial effects on health and well-being, especially when
stressors do not dissipate quickly (Gottlieb, 1997). Third, Reissman
argued that seeing support recipients overcome problems with
assistance they have been given tends to make support providers
believe they may overcome their own difficulties with similar
efforts. Viewed more broadly, helping others may increase feelings
of control in the help provider. This is important because a vast
literature links strong feelings of personal control with better health
in late life (Krause, 2003).
Although Reissman (1965) conducted his research in a secular
setting, there is reason to believe that the benefits of helping others
may be especially evident among those who attend worship ser-
vices often. In order to see why this may be so, it is important to
delve more deeply into the process of helping others. At the most
basic level, one person cannot provide effective assistance to
another without first understanding the situation of the individual
who is in need. Otherwise, the support that is provided may be
either inappropriate or, at best, ineffective. Although a number of
factors may come into play, there is some evidence that help-giving
is more effective when support providers view the objective cir-
cumstances of the support recipient with empathy and compassion.
In fact, this approach to helping others formed the cornerstone
of Carl Rogers's approach to psychotherapy. Based on years of
clinical experience, he concluded that effective help-giving in the
therapeutic setting is contingent upon the empathy, caring, and
compassion of the therapist (Rogers, 1989). These virtues are im-
portant because, as Wuthnow (1991) pointed out, they lie at the
heart of biblical teachings. More specifically, Wuthnow observed,
``The biblical tradition teaches compassion as a duty to divine law,
as a response to divine love, and as a sign of commitment to the
Judeo-Christian ethic'' (p. 50). If empathy and compassion are
essential for effective helping, and these virtues are strongly
supported by religious teachings, then the health-related effects of
helping others should be especially evident among those who
attend worship services often.
This discussion of help-giving leads to the second major
hypothesis that was examined in this study: The impact of stress on
mortality will be reduced for older study participants who provide
support to the people they worship with.
METHODS
Sample
The data for this study came from my nationwide longitudinal
survey of older Whites and older African Americans. I defined the
study population as all household residents who were either White
or Black, noninstitutionalized, English speaking, and at least 66
years old. Geographically, I restricted the study population to
eligible persons residing within the coterminous United States (i.e.,
residents of Alaska and Hawaii were excluded). Finally, I restricted
the study population to people who were currently practicing
Christians, individuals who were Christian in the past but who no
longer practiced any religion, and people who had not been
affiliated with any faith at any point in their lifetime. I excluded
individuals who practiced a religion other than Christianity (e.g.,
Jews or Muslims) because it would have been too difficult to
devise a set of religion measures that would have been suitable for
use with persons of all faiths.
The sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons contained in
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services database. I used
a five-step process to draw the sample from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services file. I provide a detailed discussion of these
steps in another article (Krause, 2002).
CHURCH-BASED SUPPORT AND MORTALITY S141
Interviewing for the baseline survey took place in 2001. All
interviews were conducted face to face in the homes of the study
participants. Harris Interactive (New York, NY) performed the data
collection. A total of 1,500 interviews were completed. Elderly
Blacks were oversampled, and, as a result, the final sample
consisted of 748 Whites and 752 African Americans. The overall
response rate for the Wave 1 survey was 62%.
The Wave 2 survey was conducted in 2004. A total of 1,024 of
the original 1,500 study participants were successfully re-
interviewed; 75 persons refused to participate, 112 could not be
located, 70 were too ill to participate, 11 had moved to a nursing
home, and 208 were deceased. Not counting those who had died
or who had been placed in a nursing home, the re-interview rate
for the Wave 2 survey was 80%.
The social support measures used in the analyses presented in the
Results section assessed assistance that older study participants
exchanged with their fellow church members. When the Wave 1
questionnaire was being developed, the research team decided it did
not make sense to ask older people questions about church-based
social support if they attended religious services no more than twice
a year. Based on this decision, the church-based social support
measures were not administered to 374 Wave 1 study participants.
These individuals were, therefore, excluded from the analyses
presented below. After listwise deletion of cases that included item
nonresponse, the analyses presented below are based on 976 cases.
Preliminary analysis revealed that 46% of these study participants
were older Whites, and 54% were older Blacks. The average age of
these individuals was 74.2 years at the baseline survey (SD Â¼ 6.2
years). Approximately 39% were older men. Finally, the older
adults in this group indicated they had successfully completed an
average of 11.7 years of schooling (SD Â¼ 3.4 years). These
descriptive data, as well as the results presented below, are based on
data that have been weighted.
Measures
Table 1 contains the core measures that were used in this
study. The table footnotes describe the procedures used to code
these items.
Mortality status. --Mortality status at the Wave 2 interview was
determined by informant report. Because no effort was made to
determine why study subjects had died, this measure reflects death
from all causes. This indicator is coded so that 1 denotes those who
had died and 0 denotes those who were not known to have died
at the time of follow-up interview.
Many studies use death certificates to verify mortality. Even so,
there are three reasons why informant reports of mortality are
useful. The first is found in a study by Wolinsky and Johnson
(1992). Using data from the Longitudinal Study on Aging, these
investigators compared informant reports of death against data
contained in the National Death Index (compiled by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services, Atlanta, GA). Wolinsky and Johnson found
virtually no difference in the study results when informant reports
were used in place of National Death Index data. Therefore, they
concluded that informants provide valid data on mortality. The
second reason why informant reports are useful may be found in
the results that will be presented later in this article. These data will
show that the pattern of findings and the magnitude of the
relationships involving well-known correlates of mortality (e.g.,
self-rated health status) are similar to estimates derived in studies
that verified mortality with death certificates. Finally, the present
study is not the first to use informant reports of death. Several other
investigators have used informant reports to conduct meaningful
research into the correlates of mortality in late life (e.g., Bernard
et al., 1997; Borawski, Kinney, & Kahana, 1996; Wolinsky &
Johnson).
Church-based emotional support. --As is shown in Table 1,
three indicators were used to measure how often older study
participants had received emotional support from their fellow
church members during the year prior to the baseline survey (M Â¼
8.363, SDÂ¼2.586). Similarly, three additional indicators were used
to assess how often the older people in this study had provided
emotional support to the people with whom they worshipped (M Â¼
8.674, SD Â¼ 2.584). It is especially important to point out that the

substance of these helping behaviors was identical across the two
scales. The items differed only with respect to whether support was
received or provided. This helped ensure that differences in the
effects of these measures could be attributed specifically to whether
the respondent gave or received support. I devised all six
indicators, as described in another article (Krause, 2002). A high
score on either scale denoted more frequent emotional support. The
internal consistency reliability measure for the scale assessing
support received was .787, whereas the corresponding estimate for
the scale assessing support provided was .843
Preliminary analysis revealed that the two church-based social
support measures were significantly related (r Â¼ .714; p , .001).
When viewed at the bivariate level, this means that one measure
explained approximately 50% of the variance in the other measure,
and an equal proportion of the variance was explained by other
factors. This suggests that the two church-based support measures
assessed related, but conceptually distinct, constructs.
Chronic financial strain. --Ongoing economic problems were
evaluated with two items that came from the work of Pearlin and
colleagues (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981; M Â¼
3.374, SD Â¼ 1.530). A high score on these measures denoted
having greater financial difficulty. The correlation between the two
items was .625 (p , .001).
Organizational religiousness. --Three indicators were used to
assess the extent to which older study participants were involved in
church. The first measured the frequency of attendance at worship
services (M Â¼ 7.114, SD Â¼ 1.567), the second assessed how often
older study participants attended adult Sunday School or Bible
study groups (M Â¼ 4.502, SD Â¼ 3.147), and the third gauged how
often the older people participated in prayer groups that were not
part of regular worship services or Bible study groups (M Â¼ 3.210,
SD Â¼ 2.805). A high score on each item represented more frequent
involvement in organized religion. Because most studies have
focused solely on the frequency of church attendance, the three
indicators of organizational religiousness were treated as separate
independent variables in the analyses presented below.
Private religiousness. --Two indicators of private religious
practices were included in the analyses to further pinpoint the
aspects of religion that are associated with a lower mortality risk.
The first assessed how often older people prayed when they were
alone (M Â¼ 7.224, SD Â¼ 1.286), whereas the second reflected how
often they read the Bible when they were at home (M Â¼ 5.106,
SD Â¼ 2.397). A high score on either measure represented greater
private involvement in religion.
Self-rated health. --Global self-rated health was assessed with
two indicators. The first asked respondents to rate their overall
health as excellent, good, fair, or poor. The second asked study
participants to compare their health at the time of the interview to
their health a year before the interview. A high score on either
measure denoted better self-rated health. The correlation between
the two indicators was .271 (p , .001).
Demographic control variables. --The relationships among
stress, the religion measures, and mortality were assessed after the
effects of age, gender, education, and race were controlled
statistically. Age was scored in a continuous format. Similarly,
education was coded in a continuous format denoting the total
number of years of completed schooling. In contrast, gender (1 Â¼
male, 0Â¼female) and race (1Â¼White, 0Â¼Black) were represented
with binary indicators.
RESULTS
I evaluated the hypotheses for this study by using a hierarchical
logistic regression analysis. Table 2 shows the findings. I centered
all independent variables on their means prior to analysis. The
analysis consisted of five steps. I present the results obtained
at each step in the discussion that follows. Following this, I pres-
ent some supplementary analyses that I have not discussed up to
this point.
Church Attendance and Mortality
I conducted the first step in the hierarchical analysis (see Model
1 in Table 2) in order to see if older people who attended church
more frequently had a lower mortality risk. Consistent with the
results of a number of other studies (e.g., Musick et al., 2004),
the data suggested that more frequent church attendance was asso-
ciated with a lower mortality risk (b Â¼ Ã.140; odds ratio [OR] Â¼
0.870; p , .05). In addition, the results further revealed that older
respondents (b Â¼ .064; OR Â¼ 1.066; p , .001), individuals with
less education (bÂ¼Ã.064; ORÂ¼0.938), and study participants with
less favorable health ratings at the baseline interview (b Â¼ Ã.392;
OR Â¼ 0.676) were more likely to die during the course of the study
follow-up period. This latter set of findings is important because it
provides evidence that results based on informant reports of death

CHURCH-BASED SUPPORT AND MORTALITY S143
are quite similar to results from studies where deaths have been
verified with death certificates (e.g., Hummer et al., 1999).
Additive Effects of Other Religion Measures
I estimated Model 2 in order to see if adding other measures of
religious involvement (i.e., attending Bible study and prayer
groups, private prayer, private Bible reading, and the additive
effects of church-based social support) to the equation helped
explain the relationship between church attendance and mortality.
Two important findings emerged from this model. First, consistent
with the findings reported by Musick and associates (2004), the
data indicated that older people who received more emotional
support from the people they worshipped with had an elevated
mortality risk (b Â¼ .159; OR Â¼ 1.173; p , .01). Second, the results
revealed that the effects of church attendance on mortality were not
diminished after the additive effects of other religion measures had
been taken into account (b Â¼Ã.160; OR Â¼ 0.852; p , .05).
Received Support, Financial Strain, and Mortality
I estimated Model 3 in order to see if emotional support
provided by fellow church members offset or buffered the effects
of financial strain on mortality in late life. I evaluated these stress
moderating effects by testing for a statistical interaction effect
between financial strain and emotional support received from
fellow church members on mortality. The data derived from
estimating Model 3 suggested that a statistically significant
interaction effect was present in the data (b Â¼ Ã.073; OR Â¼
0.930; p , .01). The sign of this relationship revealed that as the
level of support received increased, the impact of financial strain on
mortality decreased. The data in Model 3 further revealed that the
effects of church attendance on mortality were no longer
statistically significant once the stress-buffering effects of church-
based emotional support had been taken into account (b Â¼Ã.130;
OR Â¼ 0.878; ns).
Support Provided to Others, Financial Strain,
and Mortality
The second hypothesis proposed for this study stated that
providing emotional assistance to others would reduce the
deleterious effects of financial strain on mortality. I estimated
Model 4 in order to evaluate this possibility. As in Model 3, I
assessed stress-buffering effects by including a multiplicative term
in the model. However, in the case of Model 4, I included the cross-
product term in order to capture the interaction between financial
strain and providing emotional support to fellow church members
on mortality. The data provided by Model 4 suggested that the
impact of financial strain on mortality was reduced for older
people who provided more emotional support to the people in
their church (b Â¼Ã.093; OR Â¼ 0.911; p , .001).
Assessing the Relative Effects of Support
Received and Support Provided
The findings up to this point suggest that both support received
and support provided appear to offset the pernicious effects of
financial strain on mortality in late life. But it is important to know
if receiving support is more important than providing support, or
whether both affect an older person's mortality risk. I conducted
the final step in the hierarchical logistic regression analysis (see
Model 5) in order to address this issue. I entered two multiplicative
terms into the equation in order to assess the stress-buffering
effects of support received and support provided, respectively. The
data provided by Model 5 revealed that emotional support provided
by older study participants to their fellow church members offset
the noxious effects of financial strain on mortality (b Â¼ Ã.083;
OR Â¼ 0.920; p , .05), whereas emotional support received by
the participants failed to have similar stress-buffering effects
(b Â¼Ã.015; OR Â¼ 0.985; ns).
Although the data provided by Model 5 suggest that the
multiplicative term associated with providing emotional support to
others is statistically significant, it may be somewhat difficult to
determine if the interaction effect is in the hypothesized direction.
Fortunately, it is possible to clarify the nature of these results by
performing two sets of calculations by hand. The first involves
deriving separate estimates of the effects of financial strain on
mortality at selected levels of emotional support provided to others
(see Hosmer & Lemeshow, 2000, for a discussion of these
calculations). The second set of computations will show if the
estimates derived in the first set differ significantly from zero. If the
interaction effect is in the proposed direction, then the effects of
financial strain on the odds of dying should become weaker at
progressively higher levels of support. I could have performed the
calculations with any value of support provided to others. The raw
scores on this measure ranged from 3 to 12. Therefore, I selected
the following equally spaced levels of support for the computa-
tions: 3, 6, 9, and 12.
The additional computations (not shown here) suggested that
exposure to financial strain significantly increased the odds of
dying for older people who provided little emotional support to the
people they worship with (i.e., those with the lowest provided-
support score: 3; b Â¼ .615; OR Â¼ 1.850; p , .005). This is
important because 44 older adults had the lowest possible score on
the scale that assessed emotional support provided to others. The
additional calculations further revealed that financial strain was still
associated with an elevated mortality risk for older people with
a provided-support score of 6, but the deleterious effects of
financial strain had been reduced by approximately 40% (b Â¼ .366;
OR Â¼ 1.442; p , .005). A value of 6 on the provided-support scale
fell very close to -1 standard deviation below the mean support
value (Ã1 SD Â¼ 6.089). The stress-buffering effects of helping
others at church were especially evident for older people with
a provided-support value of 9 (b Â¼ .117; OR Â¼ 1.124; ns). The
pernicious effects of financial strain on mortality were completely
offset at this level. This is noteworthy because the average score on
the scale that assessed emotional support provided to fellow church
members was 8.674. Finally, the results revealed that financial
strain also failed to exert a significant effect on the odds of dying
for older people with the highest possible provided-support score
(i.e., 12; b Â¼Ã.132; OR Â¼ 0.876; ns).
Supplementary Analyses
In the Sample section, I reported that some study participants
had been excluded from the analyses because they attended church
no more than twice a year. In order to place the main study findings
in a more complete context, it was helpful to provide some
descriptive data on these individuals. I accomplished this by
creating a variable contrasting those who went to church twice
a year or less (scored 1) with those who went to church more often
(scored 0). Then, by using logistic regression, I regressed this
binary outcome on the following indicators: age, gender,
education, race, health, financial strain (Wave 1) and mortality
status (Wave 2). The data (not shown here) suggested that
compared with those who went to church often, those who went
twice a year or less were more likely to be men (b Â¼ .487; p ,
.001), less highly educated (b Â¼Ã.086; p , .001), White (b Â¼ .916;
KRAUSE
S144
p , .001), and in worse health (b Â¼ Ã.233; p , .001), and were
more likely to encounter less financial strain (b Â¼Ã.116; p , .05).
In contrast, statistically significant differences emerged with
respect to age and mortality status at the follow-up interview.
A second group of study participants was excluded from this
study because they were lost to follow-up. More specifically, they
either refused to participate in the Wave 2 interview, could not be
located for the follow-up interview, had moved into a nursing
home, or were too ill to participate in the second survey. Once
again, it was helpful to provide some descriptive data on these
individuals. I accomplished this by creating a variable that
contrasted those who were lost to follow-up (scored 1) with those
who either participated in the Wave 2 survey or were dead (scored
0). Then, by using logistic regression, I regressed this binary
outcome on the Wave 1 measures of age, gender, education, race,
health, financial strain, church attendance, and private prayer. The
findings (not shown here) indicated that no statistically signifi-
cant differences existed between the two groups for any of the
independent variables in the model.
DISCUSSION
The findings from the present study suggest that greater
involvement in religion is associated with a lower mortality risk.
A number of other investigators have reached this general
conclusion (McCullough, 2001). However, what sets the present
study apart from other work in the field is the greater specificity of
the results. So far, the wide majority of studies have focused
primarily on the relationship between the frequency of attendance at
religious services and mortality. The data provided here move
beyond this by tracing the potentially beneficial effects of religious
attendance to social relationships that tend to thrive in church
settings. More specifically, the findings reveal that providing
emotional support to fellow church members tends to lessen the
deleterious effect of the support provider's own economic problems
on mortality. However, researchers must take care when interpreting
the findings involving church attendance. Recall that the measures
of church-based support were administered only to older adults who
attended church more than twice a year. This means that providing
support and financial strain appear to explain the relationship
between church attendance and mortality, but this conclusion only
applies to older people who attend church more than twice a year.
Nevertheless, this approach is justified; if something about
involvement in the church affects longevity, then researchers must
look at what takes place within the church for the answer.
There are two reasons why greater confidence may be placed in
the results of this study than in results from existing studies in this
area. First, I observed these findings after including a number of
indicators of private and public religiousness in the model. Second,
I juxtaposed the potentially beneficial effects of giving support to
others with the effects of receiving support from fellow church
members, and only providing support emerged as a significant
factor. This appears to be the first time that anyone has examined
empirically the stress-buffering function of providing support to
others in church and mortality.
Other researchers have tried to discover if social support can
explain the connection between church attendance and mortality,
but their efforts have been largely unsuccessful. There are at least
three reasons why this may be so. First, researchers have typically
used measures that assess support from a person's entire social
network. This includes assistance that arises from both inside as
well as outside the church (e.g., Musick et al., 2004). One could
argue that this approach is justified because a strong commitment
to one's faith should affect relationships inside as well as outside
the church. However, as Ellison and George (1994) pointed out,
relationships within the church may be especially close because
they arise from a shared set of values and beliefs. The second
reason why previous studies may have failed to show that social
relationships play a significant role in explaining the connection
between church attendance and mortality has to do with the nature
of the models that have been tested. Until now, investigators have
focused exclusively on the additive effects of social support
without taking stress into consideration. But as the data provided
here reveal, the potentially beneficial effects of social ties only
become evident when they are viewed in conjunction with stress.
Put in more technical terms, researchers may not have been testing
for the correct functional form of the relationship between social
support and mortality. Third, previous studies have been concerned
solely with support received from others. However, as the findings
from the present study indicate, providing assistance to fellow
church members may be more consequential than receiving it.
Although the results provided here may be thought provoking,
a great deal of work remains to be done. To begin with, this study
focused on only one kind of stressful experience: chronic financial
strain. As a result, it is not possible to tell whether the protective
function of providing support to others extends to other kinds of
stressors as well. In addition, it would be helpful to see how the
potentially beneficial effects of providing support to others at
church arise. A number of intervening mechanisms were identified
above (e.g., self-esteem and personal control), but I did not
evaluate these factors empirically in this study. Finally, researchers
need to identify the factors that influence the provision of support
in the church in the first place (i.e., they need to treat providing
support to others at church as a dependent variable).
As research on the religionÂ­health relationship continues to
mature, some investigators have moved beyond epidemiological
studies to the development and testing of religiously based
interventions. Researchers have made important strides in areas
involving forgiveness (Worthington, Mazzeo, & Canter, 2005),
religious coping responses (Pargament, 1997), and prayer (Harris
et al., 1999). If the findings from the present study can be
replicated, then researchers may also want to develop interventions
that focus on helping older church members become more effective
support providers in their place of worship. Rosow (1976, p. 467)
spoke of aging as a ``roleless-role.'' He meant that as people go
through late life, they tend to exit a number of important social
roles. For example, they become widowed, they retire from the
workforce, and their children grow up and leave the home. At the
same time, people often find few opportunities to fill this void with
new roles and activities. The results from the present study suggest
that finding ways to become more involved in helping people
at church may be an important option. A number of interventions
have been developed to promote the help-giving process in secular
settings (see Hogan, Linden, & Najarian, 2002), but there do not
appear to be any that focus specifically on helping older people
provide support to others in religious settings.
Implementing interventions in religious settings must be done
with great care and sensitivity because ethical issues arise that are
not typically encountered in other contexts. Specifically, the United
States Constitution clearly calls for the separation of church and
state. This raises vital questions about whether it is appropriate to
use state and federal funds for the purpose of implementing church-
based social support interventions.
Alfred Adler was a noted psychiatrist. The construct of social
feeling and social interest occupied a pivotal position in his
CHURCH-BASED SUPPORT AND MORTALITY S145
theoretical perspective. Social feeling involves a sense of com-
munity, empathy, solidarity, and interest in others. Adler believed
these social feelings formed the basis of religion: ``The primal
energy which was so effective in establishing regulative religious
goals was none other than that of social feeling. This was meant to
bind human beings more closely to one another'' (Adler, 1933/
1956, p. 462). The findings from the present study suggest that
Adler may have been right. Moreover, these results reaffirm, and
reinforce, a rich intellectual tradition that spans a number of
disciplines and stretches out across a century.
