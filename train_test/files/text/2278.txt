Trends in Physical Activity, Sedentary Behavior, Diet, and
BMI Among US Adolescents, 2001­2009
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: The prevalence of overweight
and obesity in US adolescents has increased over the last century.
However, recent evidence indicates a potential change in this
trend. Parallel trends in adolescent behaviors that drive this
epidemic have not been well studied.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Analyses of recent data indicate the
prevalence of overweight and obesity may be stabilizing. Over the
same period, adolescent physical activity, breakfast eating, and
fruit and vegetable consumption increased and television viewing
and consumption of sweets and sweetened beverages decreased.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: The high prevalence of adolescent obesity in the United
States has been attributed to population changes in physical activity
(PA), sedentary behaviors, and dietary behaviors. This study examines
8-year trends in these behaviors in US adolescents ages 11 to 16.
METHODS: Nationally representative samples of US students in grades
6 to 10 were recruited during the 2001­2002 (N = 14 607), 2005­2006
(N = 9150), and 2009­2010 (N = 10 848) school years by using mul-
tistage stratified designs, with census regions and grades as strata,
and school districts as the primary sampling units. African-American
and Hispanic students were oversampled to obtain better estimates
for those groups. Using the Health Behavior in School-aged Children
quadrennial surveys, identical questions assessed BMI, PA, and
sedentary and dietary behaviors at each school year. Logistic and
linear regression analyses were conducted taking into account the
sampling design and controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, and
family affluence.
RESULTS: Across the quadrennial surveys, significant increases were
identified in number of days with at least 60 minutes of PA, daily con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables, eating breakfast on weekdays and
weekends, and BMI. Television viewing and consumption of sweets and
sweetened beverages decreased across this same period. These same
patterns were seen in all racial/ethnic groups.
CONCLUSIONS: These patterns suggest that public health efforts to
improve the obesity-related behaviors of US adolescents may be
having some success. However, alternative explanations for the
increase in BMI over the same period need to be considered.

Obesity, a risk factor for many of the
leading causes of mortality, has in-
creased dramatically over the last
century.1 However, recent studies of
nationally representative samples sug-
gest that the prevalence of obesity is
stabalizing.2­4 Further investigation of
potential causes of this change in the
obesity trajectory is warranted.
Among the preventable causes of ado-
lescent obesity are physical activity (PA),
sedentary behavior (SB), and diet.5 Al-
though PA decreased during the same
historical period that obesity increased,
there is some disagreement as to
whether PA and SB, particularly televi-
sionviewing(TV)andcomputer use (CU),
have increased or decreased since
1999.6­10 Secular trends in adolescents'
dietary behaviors (DBs) over the last 2
decades suggest a decrease in the pro-
portion of children eating breakfast, and
an increase in caloric intake, mainly
from increased consumption of snacks,
soft drinks, and fruit drinks.11,12
The purpose ofthe current study wasto
examine secular trends in adolescent
obesity,PA,SB,andDBfrom2001to2009
in nationally representative samples of
USadolescents.Gender,age,andracial/
ethnic differences in these trends were
also examined.
METHODS
Sample and Procedure
Nationally representative samples of
US students in grades 6 to 10 were
recruited during the 2001­2002 (N =
14 818), 2005­2006 (N = 9227), and
2009­2010 (N = 10 993) school years
by using multistage stratified designs,
with census regions and grades as
strata, and school district as the pri-
mary sampling units. African-American
and Hispanic students were over-
sampled to obtain better estimates for
those groups. Participants completed
the Health Behavior in School-aged Chil-
dren (HBSC) survey anonymously with
response rates of 83% in 2001­2002,
87% in 2005­2006, and 89% in 2009­
2010. Youth assent and, depending
on the requirements of the partici-
pating school districts, active or
passive parental consent were ob-
tained. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National In-
stitute of Child Health and Human De-
velopment.
Measures
During the middle of each school year,
trained assistants administered pa-
per copies of the HBSC quadrennial
surveys, which contained identical
questions assessing BMI, PA, SB, and
DB.13
Socio-demographic Variables
Socio-demographic variables included
gender, age, race/ethnicity (white,
African-American, Hispanic, and other)
and family affluence. An estimate of
family socioeconomic status was pro-
vided by the Family Affluence Scale: the
adolescent having his/her own bed-
room, scored 0 = no, 1 = yes; frequency
of family traveling vacations in the past
12 months, scored 0 = none to 3 = more
than twice; number of family com-
puters,scored0=noneto3=morethan
2;andnumberofmotorvehicles,scored
0 = none to 2 = 2 or more.14 The scale
was used as a continuous covariate in
analyses with possible scores ranging
from 0 to 9.
Physical Activity
A definition of PA was provided, "any
activity that usually increases your
heart rate and makes you get out of
breath some of the time," with exam-
ples of qualifying activities and fol-
lowed by an item that asked "How often
over the past 7 days have you been
physically active for a total of at least
60 minutes per day." The measure has
been shown to have acceptable validity
(r = 0.37 to 0.49 with accelerometer
data).15­17
SB: TV, Playing Video Games, and CU
Amount of time viewing television was
measured by the question "About how
many hours a day do you usually watch
television (including videos and DVDs)
in your free time." Video game playing
(VG) time and CU (chatting on-line, In-
ternet, e-mailing, homework, etc) were
identified in the 2005­2006 and 2009­
2010 samples. Response categories
ranged from "none at all" to "about 7 or
more hours a day." These HBSC items
have been shown to have acceptable
test-retest reliability (intraclass corre-
lations [ICCs] ranged from 0.76 to 0.81)
and validity (rs ranged from 0.36 to
0.54).18 Separate questions were asked for
weekdays and weekends, and a weighted
average of weekdays and weekend days
was computed.
Dietary Intake
As part of a validated brief food fre-
quency questionnaire, participants were
asked how many times a week they
usually ate fruits, vegetables, sweets
(chocolates and candy), and sweetened
soft drinks.19 The response options for
the items were scored as 1 = "never,"
2 = "less than once a week," 3 = "once
a week," 4 = "2 to 4 days a week," 5 = "5
to 6 days a week," 6 = "once a day, every
day," and 7 = "every day, more than
once."
Breakfast
Participants were asked "How often do
you usually have breakfast (more than
a glass of milk or fruit juice)" sepa-
rately for weekdays and weekends with
choices indicating the number of days.
Weight Status
Adolescents reported their heights and
weights. Using BMI percentiles derived
from the gender-specific BMI-for-age
growth charts of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, weight
status was categorized as follows: un-
derweight or at risk for underweight
(#15th percentile); normal weight
ARTICLE
PEDIATRICS Volume 132, Number 4, October 2013 607
(16th­84th percentile); overweight or
at risk for obesity (85th­94th percen-
tile); and obese ($95th percentile).20
Trends in both BMI percentile and
weight status were examined.
Statistical Analyses
Regression analyses were conducted
for continuous outcome variables with
each outcome regressed on year, gen-
der, age, and race/ethnicity. Family af-
fluence was included as a covariate.
Multinomial logistic regression analy-
sis was used for examining the trends
for BMI groups, with normal weight as
the reference. When significant effects
weredetected,interactionsofyearwith
gender,age,and/orrace/ethnicitywere
added to the model. All analyses took
into account the sampling design with
weights (derived with the same meth-
ods at each wave) to adjust for over-
sampling. Significance level was set at
P , .01.
RESULTS
Sample sizes and weighted demo-
graphiccharacteristicsforall3cohorts
are presented in Table 1. Across sam-
ples, there was an increasing per-
centage of boys over time (P , .001),
and the racial/ethnic composition var-
ied (P = .002). The 2005­2006 sample
was older than the samples in 2001­
2002 and 2009­2010 (P , .001). All
subsequent analyses controlled for
sample demographics. Descriptive sta-
tistics for continuous outcomes are
reported in Table 2.
Physical Activity
The average number of days of $60
minutes of PA was ,5 days per week in
all 3 samples (Table 2). PA was greater
in boys than girls at each point in time
(P , .001) (Table 3) and lower in His-
panic adolescents relative to White
adolescents (P , .001) (data not
shown). PA was lower in older adoles-
cents in 2001 and in 2005 (P , .001)
(data not shown). However, PA in-
creased over time with adolescents
reporting significantly more PA in
2009­2010 than in 2001­2002 (P = .004)
(Table 2 and Fig 1).
Television Viewing
Adolescents averaged more than 2
hours per day of TV overall and during
both weekdays and weekend days (Ta-
ble 2), with higher rates on weekend
days than weekdays (P , .001). TV de-
creased over the period being studied,
and this pattern was true for total
viewing (P , .001) as well as viewing
on weekdays (P , .001) and weekends
(P , .001) (Table 2 and Fig 1). In 2 of the
3 samples, boys reported significantly
more TV than girls (P , .001). African-
American, Hispanic, and "other" ado-
lescents reported more TV than white
adolescents (P , .001) (data not
shown).
VG and CU
VG and CU were only assessed in 2005­
2006 and 2009­2010. VG was higher in
boys (P , .001) (Table 3), younger
adolescents (P , .001), and nonwhite
adolescents (P , .001) (data not
shown). VG averaged ,2 hours per day
in all groups and did not change sig-
nificantly from 2005 to 2009 in the
overall sample but did increase sig-
nificantly in girls (P , .001) (Tables 2
and 3).
CUalsoaveraged,2hoursperdayand
did not change significantly from 2005­
2006 to 2009­2010 (Table 2). CU was
higher in girls (P , .001) (Table 3),
older adolescents (P , .001), and
nonwhite adolescents (P , .001) (data
not shown).
Dietary Intake
The averages for consumption of fruits,
vegetables, sweets, and soft drinks
were below 6, the code for at least once
a day (Table 2). Consumption of fruits

and white and other adolescents (P ,
.001) (data not shown). Consumption of
vegetables increased, but the increase
was from 2001­2002 to 2005­2006 in
boys (P , .001) and from 2005­2006 to
2009­2010 in girls (Table 2 and Fig 2).
Consumption of both sweets (P , .001)
and sweetened soft drinks (P , .001)
decreased over time, but the decrease
in soft drinks was primarily from
2001­2002 to 2005­2006 (P , .001)
(Table 2 and Fig 2). Girls were more
likely to eat sweets than boys (P ,
.001), whereas boys were more likely to
drink soft drinks than girls (P , .001)
(Table 3). Older adolescents consumed
more sweets (P , .001) and soft drinks
(P , .001), and African-American youth
consumed the most sweets (P , .001)
and soft drinks (P , .001) (data not
shown).
Breakfast
Overall, adolescents reported missing
breakfast approximately twice during
the week and were more likely to eat
breakfast on weekends (Table 2). Dur-
ing the week, girls reported eating
breakfast less frequently than boys
(P , .001) (Table 3), older adolescents
reported eating breakfast less fre-
quently than younger adolescents (P ,
.001),andAfrican-AmericanandHispanic
adolescents reported eating breakfast
less frequently than white and other
adolescents (P , .001) (data not
shown). Overall, eating breakfast on
weekdays increased from 2001­2002 to
2005­2006 (P , .001): in boys, breakfast
eating on weekdays increased from
2001 to 2009 (P , .001); in girls,
breakfasts on weekdays increased
across all 3 times (P , .001). Breakfast
eating on weekends did not change
significantly over time.

2005­2006 was seen in both boys and
girls (Tables 3 and 4; Fig 3).
Multinomial logistic regressions of BMI
group (underweight, normal weight,
overweight, and obese) on year, age,
gender, and race/ethnicity indicated
that relative to younger adolescents,
older boys and girls were less likely to
be underweight over time (odds ratio
[OR] = 0.44 [95% confidence interval
(CI) = 0.34­0.56 and OR = 0.36 [95% CI =
0.28­0.46], respectively), and older
boys were less likely to be overweight
over time (OR = 0.85 [95% CI = 0.75­
0.96]). Compared with white adoles-
cents, African-American boys and girls
were less likely to be underweight over
time (OR = 0.58 [95% CI = 0.41­0.84]
and OR = 0.60 [95% CI = 0.40­0.92],

DISCUSSION
The pattern of obesogenic behaviors in
these representative national samples
of US adolescents surveyed over the
period of 2001 to 2009 indicates there
is considerable need for improvement.
Most adolescents did not engage in the
recommended 60+ minutes per day of
PAorconsume5+servingsoffruitsand
vegetables per day.5,21 In contrast,
most adolescents exceeded recom-
mendations for ,2hours per day of
screen-based SB and minimizing con-
sumption of energy dense snacks and
sweetened beverages.21,22 The average
adolescent ate breakfast ,5 times
per week. This pattern of obesogenic
behaviors is not surprising given the
high prevalence of cardiovascular
disease risk factors among US ado-
lescents.2 Establishment of obeso-
genic behaviors during adolescence is
important because PA and diet track
from adolescence to adulthood.23
Furthermore, there is evidence that
most US youth engage in multiple
obesogenic behaviors, putting them at
greater risk for physical and psycho-
logical health problems and indicating
they could benefit from interventions
targeting PA, SB, and diet.24
It may be that current public health
efforts are succeeding; the trends from
2001 to 2009 are encouraging. In con-
trast with earlier studies, PA increased
andTV,themostprevalentSB,decreased
from 2001 to 2009.7 During the same
period consumption of fruits and vege-
tables and frequency of eating break-
fast increased, whereas consumption
of sweetened beverages and sweets
decreased. Yet it appears that the
magnitude of these changes in health
behaviors were not sufficient to re-
verse the trends in weight status; BMI
increased from 2001 to 2005. Still, there
was no significant increase in BMI from
2005 to 2009, perhaps suggesting that
the increase in adolescent obesity ob-
served over previous decades may be
beginning to stabilize.1 This leveling of
the obesity trend may be somewhat
unique to the United States, and con-
tinued improvements in PA, SB, and DB
may be necessary before the trend
begins to turn downward.4
Although the overall trends in obeso-
genic behaviors were generally the
same for adolescents of different gen-
der, age, and race/ethnicity over the
period being studied, there were sig-
nificant differences in the level of these
behaviorsacrossgender,age,andrace/
ethnicity. Consistent with previous
studies, boys report more PA than girls
at all 3 times but also more screen-
based SB (TV and VG), with the excep-
tion of CU, where girls exceeded boys.7,8
It should be noted that most studies of
obesogenic SB have focused on TV and
associations between TV and diet,
whereas negative effects of VG or CU
have not been well established.25 Pre-
vious studies have revealed mixed
results with respect to gender differ-
ences in diet; however, in our national
samples, girls exceeded boys in con-
sumption of fruits and vegetables but
also reported eating sweets more fre-
quently than boys.26,27 With respect to
risks for overweight and obesity, BMI
percentiles, adjusted for age and gen-
der, were higher in boys than girls.
Thus, the overall pattern of obesogenic
behaviors was not uniformly better in
one gender overanother: boys reported
more PA but also more SB; girls
reported more frequent consumption
of fruits and vegetables but also higher
frequency of consumption of sweets
and lower frequency of eating break-
fasts. Based on these findings, pedia-
tricians might provide different advice
for boys and girls, and interventions
could be tailored to the adolescent's
gender (eg, reducing SB in boys and
increasing PA in girls, or increasing
fruit and vegetable consumption in
boys and decreasing consumption of
sweets in girls).
Age differences in these behaviors sug-
gest a disturbing trend consistent with
previous studies.27­29 Compared with
younger adolescents, older adolescents
reported less PA, more CU, less frequent
consumption of fruits and vegetables,
more frequent consumption of sweets
and sweetened soft drinks, and less
frequent consumption of breakfast on
week days. However, younger adoles-
cents reported more frequent VG, a SB.
Even though BMI percentiles controlled
for age and gender, based on age dif-
ferences in obesogenic behaviors, it
should be no surprise that the adjusted
BMI percentiles were higher in older
adolescents. Thus, it appears that obe-
sogenic behaviors increase with age,
and this increase corresponds with an
increase in obesity. Further study is
needed to determine whether it is more
efficient for clinics and public health
efforts to focus on unhealthy patterns in
olderadolescents or if early intervention
with youngeradolescents would prevent
the increases seen in older adolescents.
Although cardiovascular risk factors in
US adolescents are prevalent across
differentrace/ethnicitygroups,African-
American and Hispanic youth in the
current studyreported higher BMIthan
white and otheradolescents.2 Even with
family affluence statistically controlled,
PA was lower in Hispanic adolescents
compared with white adolescents;
TV, VG, and CU were lowest in white
612 IANNOTTI and WANG
adolescents; fruit, vegetable, and break-
fast consumption was highest in white
and otheradolescents; and consumption
of sweets and sweetened soft drinks
were highest in African-American ado-
lescents. These findings are consistent
with previous studies of obesogenic
behaviorsinUSyouth.8,30,31 Differencesin
neighborhood access to recreational
facilities and produce markets, school
food services and policies affecting
PA, and availability of healthful ver-
sus unhealthful foods and support
for PA at home are potential socio-
environmental contributors to racial/
ethnic differences.32­36 The higher
prevalence of overweight and obesity
and the pattern of obesogenic behav-
iors in nonwhite groups confirm the
need to identify the social and envi-
ronmental conditions that influence
these behaviors in adolescents and the
need for interventions targeting the full
range of obesogenic behaviors in US
minority children and adolescents.
The primary limitation of these data is
that they are based on self-report.
However, the measures have been vali-
dated, and other studies have revealed
good correlations between self-reported
andmeasuredBMI,makingitsuitablefor
population studies.37,38 Another limita-
tion is that nationally representative
samples were maintained at each wave,
whereas matched samples could have
reducedtheriskofsamplingbias.Finally,
thesecross-sectionaldatadonotprovide
information regarding the causal rela-
tions between the behaviors and weight
status. Further research is needed to
examine the differential effects of single
and multiple obesogenic behaviors on
the development of overweight and obe-
sity in US adolescents.24
CONCLUSIONS
Efforts to increase adolescent PA and
reduce time spent watching television
may be working. The potential role of
pediatricians in improving these ado-
lescent obesogenic behaviors needs
further study. More research is needed
tosupporttheefficacyofbriefphysician
interventions as a means of improving
obesogenic behaviors in adolescents;
however,incorporatingbehaviorchange
principals into ongoing pediatric care
may have promise.39­41 Maintaining
a focus on PA and diet while broaden-
ing efforts to decrease SBs may be
necessary.

A PILL A DAY TO TAKE ADDICTION AWAY?: Managing alcohol abuse is emotionally
and clinically challenging. Relapse, which can be triggered simply by the memory
of alcohol or drinking, is common. No easy intervention exists. However, recent
research has brought greater understanding of the pathophysiology and po-
tential treatment of alcohol abuse. As reported by The New York Times (Science:
July 1, 2013), researchers used rats who had binged on alcohol for several weeks
as an animal model of alcohol dependence. Following a short period of absti-
nence, the rats were exposed to a minuscule amount of alcohol and then sub-
jected to brain scans to identify the pathways triggered by memories of alcohol.
Researchers then gave the rats a single dose of rapamycin (also known as
sirolimus), an immunosuppressant often used in transplantation that blocks
activation of the mTORC1 signaling pathway. Rats given rapamycin were signif-
icantly less likely to "relapse" over the two weeks following re-exposure when
compared to rats not given rapamycin. How long the drug will be beneficial is not
known as the trial lasted only two weeks. While there is still significant research
to be done on this topic, studies such as this one indicate that a pharmacologic
solution to alcohol abuse may not be a pipe dream.
