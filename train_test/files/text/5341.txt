Abstract
Background: The National Institutes of Health is one of the largest biomedical research agencies in the world. Clinical
trials are an important component of National Institutes of Health research efforts. Given the recent updates in
National Institutes of Health trial reporting requirements, more information regarding the current state of National
Institutes of Health­funded clinical trials is warranted. The objective of this analysis was to describe characteristics and
trends of clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health over time and by Institutes and Centers of the
National Institutes of Health.
Methods: Interventional studies funded by the National Institutes of Health and registered in ClinicalTrials.gov between
2005 and 2015 were included in the analysis. Trials were identified from the 27 March 2016 Clinical Trials
Transformation Initiative Aggregate Analysis of ClinicalTrials.gov database. A descriptive analysis of trials by year and
National Institutes of Health Institute/Center was performed.
Results: There were 12,987 National Institutes of Health­funded clinical trials registered between 2005 and 2015.
There were 1,580, 1,116, and 930 trials registered in 2005, 2010, and 2015, respectively. The majority were early-
development trials (phases 0, 1, or 2; 53%), randomized (61%), and single-center (63%). Trial demographics have
remained unchanged over time. Median trial sample size was 64 (interquartile range 29­192) with 10% of trials enrolling
500 participants. Most trials were completed within 5 years of enrollment start (69%). Trial characteristics varied con-
siderably across National Institutes of Health Institutes and Centers. Results were reported under the assumptions that
most National Institutes of Health­funded trials are registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and that trials are being registered
completely and accurately.
Conclusion: In conclusion, there has been a decline in the number of trials being funded over time, explained in part by
a relatively constant budget, increases in trial costs, or other factors that cannot be quantified. National Institutes of
Health­funded trials are relatively small and tend to be single-centered. There are substantial differences in the number
and types of trials done by Institutes and Centers within the National Institutes of Health.

Introduction
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is one of the
largest biomedical research agencies in the world.
Clinical trials are an important component of NIH
research efforts. To date, little is known with regard to
the trends and characteristics of NIH-funded trials.
Prior to registration, the task of describing such charac-
teristics was not possible because information had to
be based on data from published trials, a biased subset.

With clinical trial registration, we now have access to
information on clinical trials, whether or not
published.1
The notion of registering trials emerged in the 1980s
primarily because of concerns regarding publication
bias: the tendency for authors and editors to publish
results supporting conclusions favoring a particular
hypothesis or position.2­5 Calls for registration eventu-
ally led the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),
in the Modernization Act of 1997, to require the estab-
lishment of a system of registration pertaining to trials
of agents regulated by the FDA. The Act gave rise to
ClinicalTrials.gov, operated by the National Library
of Medicine of the NIH. Since its launch in 2000,
over 230,000 studies have been registered in Clinical
Trials.gov, and it is anticipated that more trials will be
registered in coming years, due to changes in registra-
tion requirements. First, in 2005, the International
Committee of Medical Journal Editors announced that
publication would be conditional upon trial registra-
tion prior to initiation of enrollment.6 Subsequently,
the Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act
(FDAAA 801) of 2007 expanded reporting require-
ments and the types of trials to be registered, as well as
increasing the number of data elements to be reported.
Most recently, the release of the Final Rule for
FDAAA 801 in September 2016 has further clarified
and expanded statutory requirements for trial report-
ing.7 The NIH issued an additional policy that
requires all NIH-funded trials to be registered, regard-
less of whether they are covered under FDAAA 801
requirements.7
Given the recent updates in NIH trial reporting
requirements, more information regarding the current
state of NIH-funded clinical trials is warranted. While
there have been other reports that have summarized
characteristics of clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov,
there have not been any reviews that focus solely on
NIH-funded trials and evaluate differences over time
and across Institutes and Centers. Thus, the objective
was to describe the characteristics and trends of clinical
trials funded by the NIH, summarized by year and by
Institutes and Centers.
Methods
Clinical trials data source
Data from NIH-funded clinical trials registered in
ClinicalTrials.gov between 2005 and 2015 were ana-
lyzed. Counts and summary statistics were generated
using data downloaded from the Clinical Trials
Transformation Initiative Aggregate Analysis of
ClinicalTrials.gov (AACT) database.
The AACT database is a restructured database of
the ClinicalTrials.gov data that provides exports of the
relational database as either Oracle data management
platform, pipe delimited text output, or SAS CPort
transport files.8 The AACT database is updated every
6 months and includes all clinical trials registered in
ClinicalTrials.gov to that date. Analyses were done
using the 27 March 2016 database, publicly available
at: http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/.8 The National
Clinical Trials identification number was used to link
tables and merge the AACT dataset with an export of
the ClinicalTrials.gov dataset. Identification numbers
are assigned through ClinicalTrials.gov upon registra-
tion and are included in both databases as the key iden-
tifier. Navigation through the AACT database was
accomplished using the AACT comprehensive data dic-
tionary (http://www.ctti-clinicaltrials.org/what-we-do/
analysis-dissemination/state-clinical-trials/aact-
database).
Data analysis
We performed a descriptive analysis of clinical trials
registered between 2005 and 2015 in the
ClinicalTrials.gov database. In most tables, we present
data by year (Panel A) and by NIH Institutes and
Centers (Panel B). The analysis is limited to interven-
tional studies (clinical trials), as defined in
ClinicalTrials.gov.9 The analysis was also limited to
NIH-funded trials identified from the ``agency_class''
variable in the ``sponsors'' table of the AACT database.
There were 31 different Institutes and Centers included
in the analysis listed under the ``agency'' variable and
indicated as either ``lead sponsors'' or ``collaborators.''
Any trial in which an NIH Institute or Center was
listed as ``sponsor'' (``The organization or person who
oversees the clinical study and is responsible for analyz-
ing the study data'') or ``collaborator'' (``An organiza-
tion other than the sponsor that provides support for a
clinical study. The support may include funding,
design, implementation, data analysis, or reporting'')
was included in the analysis.9
Some trials were listed as being funded by two or
more NIH Institutes or Centers. Trial identification
numbers are counted only once in tabulations repre-
sented in the A panels of tables and counted for each
funding Institute or Center in the B panels of tables.
For example, a trial registered in 2007, and funded by
three different institutes, would be counted only once
for the year 2007 in Panel A and counted once for each
funding Institute or Center associated with this particu-
lar trial in Panel B. In Panel B, NIH Institutes and
Centers were categorized by number of trials registered
for those with 100 trials. Those with \100 trials are
listed in Supplementary Table 1. Some trials were listed
as ``NIH'' without any Institute or Center designation
and referred to as ``NIH-Not Otherwise Specified.''
There were seven individual sponsor names listed under
``agencies'' in the AACT database that were excluded
66 Clinical Trials 15(1)
from the analysis as they did not belong to any specific
NIH institution or center.
Characteristics of interest included age and sex dis-
tributions, study design, trial phases, and enrollment
sizes. Sex and age groups were summarized using vari-
ables in the AACT ``clinicalstudy_noclob'' table. Sex
groups were summarized as ``male only''; ``female
only''; and ``both male and female.'' Age groups were
categorized as ``child only''; ``adult only''; ``adult and
senior,'' or other. Details of the study designs were
extracted from the allocation variable in the ``designs''
table and from the ``study_design'' variable in the
ClinicalTrials.gov database. A trial was counted as ran-
domized if the variable was recorded as ``random'' and
counted as not randomized if the variable was recorded
as ``nonrandom'' or left blank. To determine the pro-
portion of multicenter trials, trials with more than one
site were considered ``multicenter,'' and trials with one
site or left blank were counted as single-center. Clinical
trial phases were defined and described using the
ClinicalTrials.gov definitions.9
Sample size was determined from the ``enrollment''
variable labeled as either ``anticipated'' or ``actual.'' For
trials still enrolling, registrants were to set the
``Enrollment_Type'' variable to ``anticipated'' to indi-
cate ``expected enrollment.'' When enrollment was com-
pleted, the ``Enrollment_Type'' variable was set to
``actual'' and the finished sample size recorded.
Tabulations were replicated independently by two
authors (G.K.G. and J.L.M.). Discrepancies were dis-
cussed and resolved.
Results
A total of 211,437 studies were included in the 27 March
2016 AACT database of which 170,347 were registered
as interventional studies (clinical trials). After limiting
the year first received to 2005­2015, 156,608 trials were
included. After limiting to trials funded by ``NIH'' and
controlling for multiple counts of trials funded by more
than one Institute or Center (n = 1,015), a total of
12,987 unique trials were included and sorted by year in
Panel A. There has been a decline from 1,580 trials regis-
tered in 2005 to 930 trials registered in 2015 (Figure 1).
The majority of NIH-funded trials are phase 1 (17%)
and phase 2 (35%). Phase 3 and phase 4 trials make up
about 11% and 5% of the trial portfolio over the last
10 years. A third of NIH-funded trials were classified as
``Other'' phase or ``Phase not specified.'' ``Other'' trials
refer to trials that do not fit the definition of phases.
Over time, there has been a decline in the percentage of
phase 3 or 4 trials and an increase in ``other'' trials
(Table 1, Panel A).
Of the 27 Institutes and Centers listed, 15 had 100 or
more clinical trials registered (.95% of all trials regis-
tered). The number of trials declined over time for
Institutes and Centers with 100 or more trials regis-
tered, although stayed constant for Institutes and
Centers with less than 100 trials registered
(Supplementary Figure 1). The National Cancer
Institute has the most trials (n = 4,986), while the
Office of Rare Diseases has the least (n = 10).
National Center for Medical Rehabilitation Research,
part of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute
of Child Health and Human Development, and
Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases, part of
the National Center for Advancing Translational
Science, each registered three trials. There were 1,047
trials funded by ``NIH-Not Otherwise Specified'' that
were excluded from counts in Panel B.
The NIH Institutes and Centers vary widely in distri-
bution of trials by phase (Table 1, Panel B). For
Figure 1. Number of NIH-funded, registered trials by phase and year of registration.

example, about 70% of the National Cancer Institute
trials are registered as phase 1 or 2 trials compared to
24% of National Institute on Aging trials. The
National Eye Institute conducts the largest percentage
of phase 3 trials (32%) and the National Center for
Research Resources funds the most phase 4 trials
(16%). Overall, there were 4,075 trials classified as
``other.'' The majority of ``other'' trials were ``beha-
vioral'' or ``dietary'' trials (55%). Some were classified
as ``device'' trials (6%).
The composition of trials by age and sex over time
and by NIH Institute or Center is shown in Table 2.
The distribution of age and sex has been constant over
time (Table 2, Panel A). The majority of trials include
both females and males (85%). Female-only trials
(11%) outnumber male-only (4%) trials about three to
one. The majority of trials (93%) included combina-
tions of adults only, seniors only, or other age combi-
nations, while the remainder of trials (7%) included
children only.
The percentages of trials that are multicenter and ran-
domized have remained unchanged over time: 33% mul-
ticenter and 61% randomized (Supplementary Table 2).
The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases has the most multicenter trials (50%) and the
National Center for Complementary and Integrative
Health the least (16%). The National Institute of
Nursing Research has the highest percentage of rando-
mized trials (94%) and the National Cancer Institute the
lowest (32%). When categorizing by trial phase, 45.9%

``Other'' trials were randomized.
Median sample sizes and interquartile ranges by year
and Institutes and Centers are displayed in Figure 2(a)
and (b). Overall, the median sample size of all NIH-
funded trials was 64 (29­192). Median sample sizes by
phase were 31 (15­90) for phase 0; 30 (18­57) for phase
1, 55 (28­120) for phase 2, 306 (145­692) for phase 3,
and 108 (48­250) for phase 4 trials. Median sample size
was 113 (45­300) for ``Other'' trials (Supplementary
Table 3).
There were 7303 trials where enrollment was
``actual'' of which 9.5% had 500 participants enrolled
and 4.3% had 1,000 participants enrolled (Table 3).
The percentage of trials with 500 and 1,000 partici-
pants stayed relatively constant over time, ranging
between 7.4 to 10.5% and 2.5 to 6.6%, respectively.
The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development had the largest
percentage of trials with over 19% enrolling 500 par-
ticipants and 10% enrolling 1,000. Among trials that
are completed (N = 5,377), 10.5% and 4.5% enrolled
500 and 1,000 participants, respectively.
The percentage of trials completed within 3, 4, and
5 years from enrollment start is provided in Table 4.
Approximately 69% of trials are completed within
5 years, 51% within 4 years, and 34% within 3 years
from start of enrollment. The percentage of trials

from 2005 to 2009 (Table 4). Institutes and Centers
with more than 100 trials registered and over 50% of
trials completed within 3 years included the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (60%), the
National Eye Institute (55%), and the National Center

pleted 40%, 64%, and 79% within 3, 4, and 5 years of

Discussion
Clinical trials are critical for generating high-quality
evidence to guide clinical practice and improve public
health. Over the last decade, the NIH has funded
almost 13,000 clinical trials registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov. Registration allowed us to identify
and characterize these trials.
Findings from our analysis suggest that there has
been a decline in NIH-funded trials since 2005, as regis-
tered in ClinicalTrials.gov. This finding is consistent
with results from other studies.10­12 The decline could
be explained by a flat NIH budget, remaining constant

at US$3.2 billion a year over the last decade.13,14 When
adjusted using the consumer price index, this is approx-
imately 20% less in real dollars in 2015 than in 2005.13
It could also be explained by increases in per-patient or
per-trial costs, changes in trial registration behavior, or
other factors that cannot be quantified. Increasing trial
costs have been observed in industry-funded trials over
time and have also been identified as barriers to
government-funded trials.15 In this report, the esti-
mated average cost of a phase 1 trial has been reported
to range from US$1.4 to US$6.6 million, a phase 2
study from US$7 to US$19.6 million, and a phase 3
study from US$11.1 to US$52.9 million dollars.15
However, the authors point out that it is difficult to
obtain accurate cost estimates, and the estimates they
provided are not adjusted for inflation.
There is considerable variation in the number of
trials funded by the different NIH Institutes and
Centers. This may be explained in part by the different
missions of each Institute or Center in addition to the
duration of time since they were established. However,
while some Institutes and Centers, for example,
National Library of Medicine, are not necessarily
expected to fund trials, others, for example, National
Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, have a
clinical content area and mission but fund few trials.
One might hope that the decline in NIH-funded trials
would have been offset by trials with larger sample sizes,
but there is no evidence this is so. The majority of NIH-
funded clinical trials are small with median sample sizes
ranging from 51 to 80 (21­213). A surprising finding was
that the median sample sizes of phase 4 trials were smaller
than those of phase 3 trials. These numbers did not change
when including the sample sizes for only completed trials
or evaluating them separately by year of registration. This
might be due to the small number of phase 4 trials that
are funded by the NIH. These are conducted after a drug
has been approved by the FDA for marketing.

72 Clinical Trials 15(1)
For randomized trials with two groups, those sam-
ple sizes correspond to 25­40 people per group. These
numbers may be even smaller than shown, as we
included ``anticipated'' enrollment in the calculations
and ``anticipated'' often falls short of ``actual.'' The
proportion of large trials (.500 participants) is small
and has not changed over time. Approximately 10%
(n = 694) of trials enrolled more than 500 participants,
and 4% (n = 316), more than 1,000. Other reports
describe similar findings.10­12,16 For instance, Califf
et al. reported a median sample size of 58 (27­161) in
all trials registered between 2007 and 2010, regardless
of the source of funding.11 Overall, these findings raise
the question about whether NIH-funded trials are pow-
ered to produce meaningful differences, especially for
trials with clinical outcomes.17­20
Our findings suggest that most trials funded by the
NIH are early- and middle-stage trials. Only 16% of
NIH-funded trials are phase 3­4 studies, and the num-
bers have decreased over time.
There is variation in the distribution of trials by
phase across the different Institutes and Centers. For
instance, the National Eye Institute funded the highest
proportion of phase 3­4 studies, while the National
Cancer Institute funded the lowest. Trials funded by
the National Cancer Institute were mostly early-phase
trials, of which only a third were randomized. The gen-
der and age composition has remained stable. Our
results suggest that female-only trials have consistently
outnumbered male-only trials over time, possibly as a
result of the 1993 NIH Revitalization act.21
There has been a notable increase in the number of
``other'' trials being funded by the NIH, possibly
explained by a shift in the clinical trial landscape and
focus on a larger number of non-therapeutic trials. An
expansion of the ClinicalTrials.gov registration fields
for the ``Other trials'' would be a useful change in order
to better capture and classify ``other'' trials. Currently,
it is difficult to understand the types of trials classified
as ``other.''
The number of multicenter and randomized trials is
small and has remained constant over time. The need
for large clinical trials to answer important clinical and
health policy questions has been previously noted, as
has the lack of support and resources from major fun-
ders of clinical research.22 The NIH mission is to ``seek
fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior
of living systems and the application of that knowledge
to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and
disability.''23 While the majority of NIH-funded trials
are early-development trials, as shown in our analysis,
supporting the first part of the stated mission, there is a
need for more large, randomized trials to support the
latter part of this mission.
There are limitations associated with using and ana-
lyzing data from ClinicalTrials.gov. Tracking the state
of NIH-funded trials via information contained in
ClinicalTrials.gov is predicated on the assumption that
trials are registered.24 NIH project officers work to
ensure registration and, increasingly, NIH Institutes
and Centers do not release funds until trials are regis-
tered. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the number
of NIH-funded trials not registered is small. The release
of the Final rule in September 2016 will likely improve
the reporting of NIH-funded trials in ClinicalTrials.gov
further.7,25
Another limitation is the potential for incomplete
data or misclassification of funding source. Funding
source is derived from how registrants complete the
``sponsor'' and ``collaborator'' fields when registering.
If NIH is mentioned in either field, the trial is identified
as NIH-funded. Otherwise, the trial is not identified as
being NIH-funded, even if in fact it is. To remove con-
fusion surrounding funding type in ClinicalTrials.gov,
registrants should be explicitly asked to indicate fund-
ing source, independent of the collaborator, sponsor,
or grant number.
It is difficult to estimate the extent of under reporting
of NIH as a funding source. To explore this issue, two
independent reviewers compared NIH-funded trials
in ClinicalTrials.gov to trials listed in the NIH
RePORTER.14 There was a small proportion of trials
(;10%), which varied by NIH Institutes and Trials, that
were listed in RePORTER and not indicated as NIH-
funded in ClinicalTrials.gov. To investigate further, we
used the secondary identifiers from ClinicalTrials.gov,
added in 2009, to identify NIH-funded trials by grant
numbers. Numbers from this search were slightly higher
than those derived from the ``funder_type'' variable.
However, cleaning and sorting grant numbers to cor-
rectly categorize them is a cumbersome task.
Furthermore, it is not guaranteed that grant numbers are
entered accurately or completely. While study counts
varied slightly across the different sources, the reported
trends and conclusions remained unchanged.
In conclusion, there has been a decline in the num-
ber of registered NIH-funded trials since 2005. Most
NIH-funded trials are small and single-centered, with a
large fraction that are non-randomized. Substantial dif-
ferences exist in the number and types of trials done by
Institutes and Centers within the NIH. Limitations
associated with the accuracy and completeness of regis-
tration data among other registration variables were
uncovered in this analysis, as these have to be inferred.
However, while the registration system is imperfect, it
is an important step forward toward accountability of
funders, sponsors, and trialists.
