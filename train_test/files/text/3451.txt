Introduction
Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation pathway
existing in eukaryotic cells, which run through the whole
process of normal cell growth, development, and patho-
physiology, and is an important way for biological degra-
dation of intracellular proteins to complete organelle
transformation and to maintain homeostasis.1­3 Autophagy
plays a critical role in the growth and development, cell
differentiation, and the environmental stress response of
the organism, and its physiological function is involved in
normal growth and the development process of cells and
maintaining metabolic balance.4­6 In the kidney, there is a
close relationship between autophagy and glomerular
podocyte injury as well as proteinuria, and autophagy reg-
ulation may become a new measure for proteinuria preven-
tion. TRPC6 was a newly found virulence gene which
caused familial focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(FSGS). The product of this gene is a non-selective cation
channel protein which is located in podocyte. The dys-
function of the podocyte structure and the function is
essential for glomerular kidney diseases. TRPC6 plays a
very important role in maintaining the structure and func-
tion of podocyte according to recent research. As the
research of autophagy increases, new knowledge on the
role of autophagy in podocyte impairment and proteinuria
genesis has been partially revealed; the autophagy regula-
tion could be a new mechanism for proteinuria prevention
and treatment. In this study, we investigated the effects of
TRPC6-silenced by siRNA on the podocyte autophagy
induced by AngII. The molecular mechanism of this pro-
cess was elucidated from the autophagy view.

Abstract
Objective: the objective of this article is to evaluate the role of siRNA-silenced TRPC6 on podocyte autophagy and
apoptosis induced by AngII.
Methods: mouse podocyte cell lines were cultured in vitro. The apoptosis rates of each group were detected using
flow cytometry. The expression of LC3-II protein and changes in distribution were detected by confocal laser, and the
western blot protocol was employed for detection of protein expression of LC3-II.
Results: AngII-injured podocyte had a significant increase in apoptosis, while silencing TRPC6 could decrease the
apoptosis induced by AngII. Autophagy remarkably increased after AngII injury. While silencing TRPC6 stabilized the
autophagy expression, AngII could activate the autophagy of podocyte. Autophagy-associated protein LC3-II expression
increased after AngII injury. The LC3-II mRNA and the protein level could be down regulated by 3-MA. The silencing of
TRPC6 could stabilize the autophagy expression.
Conclusion: the data suggest that AngII can lead to podocyte injury. Autophagy may have beneficial effects in preventing
the progression of proteinuria. This study provides some new clues for further exploring the occurrence of podocyte
injury and the development mechanism of proteinuria.

Material and methods
Podocyte culture
Vitro immortalized mouse podocyte cell lines (MPC5)
were authorized for the US Mundel Professor, Professor of
Pediatrics, Peking University First Hospital, Ding Jie
donation. Under the license conditions, podocyte recovery
was at 33°C, contained 10 U/mL recombinant mouse
-interferon (PEPRO Tech Company), and used a RPMI
1640 medium containing 10% FBS (Hyclone company)
(Gibco company) culture proliferated. Then, it was inocu-
lated into collagen coated I (BD Biosciences Inc.) flasks or
six-well plates; 12 induced differentiations of the cells
were cultured for 14 days at a mature podocyte at 37°C so
they could be used for the experiments. All experiments
were repeated three times.
Podocyte transfection
TRPC6 siRNAdouble strands were synthesized by Shanghai
Jima Biotech and Engineering Co. Sequences were as fol-
lows: plussense:ATTGATCCTGGATCTAGAGTG and anti
sense:ATTGATCCTGGATCTAGAGTG. Transfection was
conducted by oligofectamine equipment (Invitrogen). The
culture medium was changed to a common RPMI 1640
medium after a transfection of approximately 6 h and cells
were incubated at 33°C. siRNA transfection was monitored
under a fluorescence microscope after 24 h and the effi-
ciency was detected by flow cytometry. WB was taken out
to measure TRPC6 protein expression 48 h after transfec-
tion. All cell groups in the experiments were designed with
three replicates.
Western blotting
Cells in the 25 cm2 culture bottle were first washed twice
by a pre-cooled PBS buffer, then they were incubated with
a 100 µl cell disruption buffer (0.1% Triton X-100,75 mM
NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris (pH 7.0), 1 mM PMSF, 1
g/ml aprotinin, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 g/ml pepstatin) for
30 min. Then, they were centrifugalized at 12000 g and
supernatant was taken for total protein determination by
BCA method. The equivalent of 75 g total protein was
loaded for SDS PAGE and transferred to PVDF mem-
brane. WB was then carried out using GAPDH as the inte-
rior reference. Quantitative analysis was done by Image J
software and each independent experiment was repeated
three times.
Laser scanning confocal microscopy
measurement
FITC and TRITC fluorescence was monitored under laser
scanning confocal microscopy (Olympus). Eye lens that
were 10x and 60x (immersion objective) objective lens
were used. Operations were carried out in a single blind
situation where the operator did not know the detail of the
sample grouping. Photography was taken with a SHARP-
2000 and all experiments had three replicates.
FCM detection of podocyte apoptosis
According to the equipment operation instructions, cell
cycle was synchronized for 24 h first. Nearly confluent
cells were then grouped. Cells (5×105/ml) were collected
and suspended with 200 µl of binding buffer, and then 10
µl of Annexin-v-FITC and 5 µl of PI were added for a 15
min light cycle avoiding incubation at room tempera-
ture. After incubation, 300 µl of binding buffer was
added for FCM detection; the experiment had three
replicates.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed by SPSS16.0 statistics software.
Data were shown as mean ± SD. A t-test with p-value
smaller than 0.05 was applied for differentiation with sta-
tistical significance.
Results
The optimization of podocyte transfection
Podocyte was transfected by GFP labeled NC-siRNA;
cells with green fluorescence were counted under a fluo-
rescence inverted microscope. The transfection efficiency
was calculated by dividing the total cells in the same field
of view (Figure 1(a) and (b)). Flow cytometry and the
western blot protocol were also employed for detection of
the transfection efficiency (Figure 1(c) and (d)).
Podocyte apoptosis monitored by FCM
The podocyte apoptosis ratio of the control group was 2.36
± 0.50%, while podocyte apoptosis was significantly
increased to 14.46 ± 0.40% after AngII treatment com-
pared to the control group (p < 0.05). Mock vector trans-
fection did not affect the apoptosis compared to the control
group (p > 0.05). TRPC6-silenced podocyte had an apop-
tosis ratio of 4.33 ± 0.45% which was not statistically sig-
nificant to the control group (p > 0.05). When
TRPC6-silenced podocyte was treated with AngII, apopto-
sis was significantly decreased compared to the control
group (p < 0.05) (Figure 2).
Autophagy detected by TEM
The ultrastructure showed that little autophagy expressed
in podocyte. The structure and distribution of organelles,

nucleus, and chromatosome were normal in the control
group. AngII-impaired podocyte showed ultrastructural
changes and the autophagy increased significantly. A
great quantity of independent double membrane struc-
tures emerged, gradually extended, and bent. These
included autophagosomes containing cytoplasm, lyso-
some, and other organelles. It is significantly different
from the control group (p < 0.01) (Figure 3). While
TRPC6-silenced podocyte was not sensitive to AngII, the
autophagy was significantly lower than the AngII-treated
group (p < 0.05).
Detection of expression of autophagy-
associated protein LC3-II by western blotting
LC3-II expression in normal podocyte (control group) was
very low as the immunoblotting band was slender. The
same results were observed in the 3-MA treated group.
When podocyte was impaired by AngII, the LC3-II expres-
sion increased remarkably compared to the control group (p
< 0.01). TPRC6-silenced podocyte hardly changed the
LC3-II level after AngII treatment; the same situation was
observed in the 3-MA inhibited group. The expression

difference was statistically significant compared to the con-
trol group (p < 0.05) (Figure 4).
LC3-II expression after TRPC6 silencing
detection by laser confocal microscope
The expression of LC3-II was fairly weak in normal podo-
cyte under a confocal microscope, while the AngII-injured
podocyte had a remarkable increase in LC3-II expression
compared to the control group (p < 0.01). When TRPC6
was silenced by siRNA, the expression of LC3-II became
stable and statistically significant to the control group (p <
0.01) (Figure 5).
Discussion
Autophagy is a lysosom-dependent degradation pathway
widely existing within eukaryotic cells as a self-protection
mechanism in response to pessimal stimulation, and the
function of autophagy is not only involved in surrounding
and isolating the damaged organelles, but more important
in transporting the surrounded materials to lysosomes for
degradation and producing amino acids, ATP, and other
substances to maintain the energy metabolism cycle of the
body.7 Research demonstrated that a mouse lacking in
autophagy-related gene 5 (Atg5) in podocyte cells would
be more susceptible to glomerular diseases, and the
decrease of autophagy within podocyte cells would delay

the update of the cytoplasmic constituents, resulting in a
mismatch protein accumulation, further leading to the for-
mation of the inclusion bodies and the dysmorphic cells.
The regulation of autophagy was becoming the new mech-
anism for proteinuria prevention and cure. TRPC6 was a
newly discovered virulence gene which caused familial
FSGS. It is a non-selective cation channel protein which is
specifically located in glomerular podocyte. The dysfunc-
tion of the podocyte structure and the function is essential
for glomerular kidney diseases. TRPC6 played a very
important role in maintaining the structure and function of
podocyte according to recent research.8, 9
Research has shown that cis-platinum can cause apopto-
sis and necrosis of renal tubular epithelial cells (RTEC) and
that it was a dose and time dependent course. The cell death
pattern differed when time and concentration were var-
ied.10­13 Man Jiang et al.13 observed that when RTEC was
injured by hypoxia, the level of autophagy increased and
finally caused cell apoptosis. Their research also suggested
that autophagy had a protective effect on RTEC apoptosis.
Pallet et al.14 found that ciclosporin could impair RTEC
through ER stress and autophagy had a protection. Yang et
al.15 found in the model of RTEC impaired by cis-platinum
that LC3, Beclin1, and Atg5 were all increased when the

autophagy formed. Autophagy inhibitor and autophagy
gene Beclin1,Atg5-silenced could accelerate the activity of
caspases and RTEC apoptosis. Conversely, improving the
level of autophagy could inhibit RTEC apoptosis which
suggested that autophagy could protect against poisoned
kidney injury. Periyasamy-Thandavan et al.16 found that an
anti-apoptosis protein such as Bcl-2 could inhibit autophagy
in a cis-platinum interfered mouse kidney. The same effect
was found with 3-MA. Lau17 observed that cis-platinum
could induce RTEC necrosis with engorged kytoplasm and
cause the membrane integrity to disappear. Man Jiang et
al.13 elucidated that 3-MA or Beclin-1, Atg5-silenced could
induce the hypoxia impairment of podocyte leading to cell
apoptosis. The research suggested that autophagy had a
protective role in kidney ischemic and hypoxia injury.
Suzuki et al.18 studied the autophagy during human kidney
transplant and rat testes ischemia-reperfusion. The
autophagy-associated protein LC-3 expression increased.
Thus, ischemia could induce autophagy and reperfusion
could accelerate autophagysome formulation. Matsui

et al.19 found that autophagy mainly functioned as a protec-
tive factor during kidney ischemia when reperfusion was
carrying on. Chien et al.20 found that the transfection of the
Bcl-xL gene could remarkably relieve RTEC autophagy
and improve kidney failure in the ischemia-reperfusion
mouse model. Sato et al.21 defined two types of autophagy
in the nephronia pathological section under TEM: Type I
and Type II autophagysome. The study of IgA nephronia
patients found eight cases of Type I autophagysome. Of
these cases, 37.5% were FSGS for the first time patho-
logic diagnosis. The other eight cases were Type II
autophagysome, of which 87.5% were FSGS for the first
time pathologic diagnosis. The research suggested that the
type of autophagysome was closely related to the progno-
sis. However, there were few reports about podocyte-
associated molecules in autophagy.
TRPC6 was recently found as a virulence gene causing
familial FSGS.22,23 It is a six-transmembrane protein of
which the cation channel was formed by the fifth and sixth
transmembrane domains, while the NTD and CTD were
located intracellularly. The TRPC family can be divided
into four subgroups: TRPC1, TRPC2, TRPC4/5, and
TRPC3/6/7. TRPC3/6/7 has 75% homogeneity which con-
stitutively formed the functional channel.24 TRPC6 had a
low expression in rat glomcrulus and both the resistance
vessel and arteria renalis expressed. TRPC6 expression in
podocyte in the rat neohridial tissue.25, 26 The endothelial
cell also had weak expression. Immune-gold labeling
showed that TRPC6 was located in the podocyte primary
and secondary foot process, and mainly distributed near
the SD molecules. TRCP6, together with SD molecules
such as podocin and nephrin, composed the signaling com-
plex to maintain the structural and functional integrity of
the foot process and SD molecules. TRPC6 played an
important role in maintaining the glomerular filtration bar-
rier. Moller et al.27 showed that TRPC6 mRNA was
remarkably lower in minimal lesion and MGN patients
than in healthy adults. Reiser et al.28 transfected podocyte
with GFP-labeled TRPC6. These suggested that TRPC6
played a very important role in proteinuria genesis and
development.
Our study showed that AngII-injured podocyte had a
significant apoptosis increase, while the silencing of
TRPC6 could decrease the apoptosis induced by AngII.
Autophagy in normal podocyte was weak, but it remark-
ably increased after AngII injury. While the silencing of
TRPC6 stabilized the autophagy expression even when
faced with AngII injury, it suggested that the silencing of
TRPC6 could inhibit the podocyte apoptosis when injured
by AngII. AngII could activate the autophagy of the podo-
cyte. Autophagy-associated protein LC3-II expression
increased after AngII injury. The LC3-II mRNA and pro-
tein level could be down regulated by 3-MA. The silenc-
ing of TRPC6 could stabilize the autophagy expression.
In short, the silencing of TRPC6 could inhibit the
autophagy abnormal expression caused by AngII impair-
ment and thus protect the autophagy and inhibit podocyte
apoptosis to safeguard the podocyte.
Conclusions
TRPC6 participated in the molecular biological mecha-
nism of podocyte autophagy induced by AngII. Autophagy
played a very important role in podocyte impairment
repair. Autophagy regulation is a complicated process
which involved multiple mechanisms. Our study eluci-
dated the podocyte impairment protection from the
autophagy point of view which provided new insight and
theory basis for kidney disease prevention and cure.
