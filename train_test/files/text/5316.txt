Abstract
Objective: Atorvastatin reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. However, the effects of
atorvastatin on platelet aggregation are unknown.
Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 126 healthy volunteers. Prepared isolated platelet
suspensions were adjusted with saline to three different concentrations of 100 Â 109, 300 Â 109,
and 600 Â 109 platelets/L. Platelet samples were incubated with atorvastatin (10À7 mol/L,
10À6 mol/L or 10À5 mol/L), and stimulated with ADP (10 mmol/L), arachidonic acid (0.5 mmol/L),
collagen (2 mg/mL), and epinephrine (1 mg/mL). The maximal amplitude of aggregation and the
curve slope were measured by electric impedance aggregometry.
Results: Atorvastatin inhibited platelet aggregation at moderate (300 Â 109/L) and high
(600 Â 109/L) concentrations. However, an inhibitory effect of atorvastatin at low concentrations
(100 Â 109/L) was not observed.
Conclusions: The study shows that atorvastatin inhibits platelet aggregation in vitro, and this
inhibitory effect is related to platelet concentrations.

an integral part of therapy for patients
with cardiovascular disease, especially for
those with acute coronary syndrome and
those undergoing percutaneous coronary
intervention.
As other antiplatelet drugs, statins are
strongly recommended in acute coronary
syndrome therapy. Statins are effective
lipid-lowering drugs, which inhibit choles-
terol biosynthesis by inhibition of 3-hydroxy-
3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase. Many stu-
dies have shown that statins can reduce the
incidence of cardiovascular events, such as
myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovas-
cular death.1,2 Moreover, evidence has shown
that statins have other effects that are inde-
pendent of their cholesterol-lowering func-
tion, including inhibition of formation of
foam cells, stabilizing plaques, anti-inflam-
matory effects, and inhibition of platelet
activation.3­5 These characteristics of statins
may be not related to their cholesterol-low-
ering effects, which are called pleiotropic
effects of statins. Several clinical trials have
demonstrated that statins significantly reduce
the risk of cardiovascular events in patients
with hyperlipidaemia, as well as normocho-
lesterolemic patients.5,6 Results from these
trials indicate that the beneficial effects of
statins on cardiovascular events cannot be
only explained by their cholesterol-lowering
effects. Therefore, further research is needed
to clarify the exact mechanism of antiplatelet
effects of statins.
This study aimed to investigate the effects
of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation and
whether the effects are related to platelet
concentrations. Our findings may provide
evidence of clinical use of atorvastatin in
patients with or without hyperlipidaemia.
Materials and methods
Materials
Atorvastatin was obtained from the
National Institute for the Control of
Pharmaceutical and Biological Products.
ADP, arachidonic acid (AA), collagen, and
epinephrine (EP) were purchased from
Chrono-Log Corp. (USA).
Blood samples
Blood samples were obtained from 126
healthy volunteers. The donors were healthy
adults aged 18 to 55 years (female patients
did not have their menstrual period). None
of the volunteers took any drugs that could
have an interaction with platelets at least 10
days before collection of blood. All of the
subjects provided informed consent. Blood
biochemical indicators and haematological
parameters of all of the subjects were tested
and were all within the normal range.
Citrate anti-coagulated venous blood
(final citrate/blood ratio 1:9 vol/vol) was
placed in tubes for laboratory analyses.
Platelets were isolated from blood by
centrifugation, as previously described.7 To
simulate the human body platelet concen-
tration, prepared isolated platelet suspen-
sions were adjusted with saline to three
different concentrations of 100 Â 109,
300 Â 109, and 600 Â 109 platelets/L.
The study was approved by the ethical
committee of Hebei Medical University,
China (approval no.201600131). All of the
participants provided written informed con-
sent and received compensation for their
participation.
Platelet treatment with atorvastatin
Atorvastatin was dissolved in
Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) into stock solu-
tion and prepared as three different doses
immediately before use. Different concen-
trations of platelet suspensions were incu-
bated (10 min, 37C) with atorvastatin at
final concentrations of 10À7 mol/L,
10À6 mol/L, or 10À5 mol/L in the experimen-
tal groups.8,9 The effects of atorvastatin in
the experiments were compared with the
same concentration of DMSO as a control.
Zhao et al. 83
The concentration of DMSO was 0.1%, at
which concentration platelet function is not
affected.10,11
Platelet aggregation test
Platelet aggregation was tested with induc-
tion by ADP (10 mmol/L), AA (0.5 mmol/L),
collagen (2 mg/mL), and epinephrine (1 mg/
mL). The maximal amplitude of aggregation
and the curve slope were monitored for up
to 10 min in response to agonists. The
changes were measured by electric imped-
ance aggregometry (Model 590-4D;
Chrono-Log Corporation) according to the
manufacturer's protocol.
Statistical analysis
The Shapiro­Wilk test was used to deter-
mine whether the data were normally dis-
tributed. For data with a normal
distribution, continuous variables are
expressed as mean Æ SD. Overall compari-
son in each group was evaluated by single-
factor ANOVA analysis. For non-normally
distributed data, the variables are expressed
as median and quartile (QR). Overall com-
parison in each group was evaluated by
Friedman's M test. A value of P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Effects of atorvastatin on low-concentra-
tion platelet aggregation
As shown in Table 1, atorvastatin (10À7 mol/L,
10À6 mol/L, or 10À5 mol/L) did not affect
platelet aggregation and the curve slope with
a concentration of 100Â 109 platelets/L
induced by ADP (10mmol/L), AA (0.5mmol/
L), collagen (2mg/mL), and EP (1mg/mL).
Effects of atorvastatin on moderate-
concentration platelet aggregation
Effects of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation
with a concentration of 300 Â 109 platelets/L
are shown in Table 2. There were no signifi-
cant differences in aggregation and the curve
slope among the four groups after incubation
with atorvastatin and induction by ADP
(10 mmol/L) and AA (0.5mmol/L).
Effects of atorvastatin on platelet aggre-
gation induced by collagen (2 mg/mL) and
EP (1 mg/mL) among the five groups were
observed. As shown in Table 2 and
Figure 1(a), atorvastatin suppressed aggre-
gation of platelets that were stimulated with
collagen in a dose-dependent manner
(P < 0.05). Similar effects were observed
with curve slopes induced by collagen.

Moreover, atorvastatin also affected platelet
aggregation after EP stimulation in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 1(b)).
Effects of atorvastatin on high-concentra-
tion platelet aggregation
Furthermore, the effects of atorvastatin on
platelet aggregation with a concentration of
600 Â 109 platelets/L were analysed. As
shown in Table 3 and Figure 2, atorvastatin
suppressed aggregation of platelets that
were stimulated with ADP (10 mmol/L),
AA (0.5 mmol/L), collagen (2 mg/mL), and
EP (1 mg/mL) in a dose-dependent manner.
Similar effects were also observed with curve
slopes induced by these stimulations.
Discussion
Platelet aggregation is a complex process
involving multiple signalling processes and
other factors. Our study showed that ator-
vastatin inhibited platelet aggregation at
moderate (300 Â 109/L) and high
(600 Â 109/L) concentrations. However, an
inhibitory effect of atorvastatin at a low
concentration (100 Â 109/L) of platelet

aggregation was not observed. These
findings indicated that atorvastatin could
inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro, and
these inhibitory effects were related to the
concentration of platelets.
Recently, statins have been shown to be
the most important class of lipid-lowering
agents and are recommended as the first-
choice treatment for hyperlipidemia.12
Several studies have demonstrated that
hyperlipidaemia is associated with platelet
hyperactivity.13 Platelet activation and
aggregation play important roles in the
pathogenesis of arterial thrombosis and the
occurrence of acute coronary syndrome.
Many clinical studies have shown that
patients could benefit from statins by redu-
cing myocardial infarction, stroke, and
cardiovascular death.14,15
The benefit of statin treatment on
patients with coronary artery disease
cannot solely be attributed to their lipid-
lowering effects.2,16 Atorvastatin has been
shown to dose-dependently reduce collagen-
induced TXA2 synthesis and platelet aggre-
gation, which are unrelated to its cholesterol
lowering effects.10 Additionally, direct
inhibition effects of statins on platelet acti-
vation are mediated by peroxisome prolif-
erator-activated receptors and are involved
in an interaction with protein kinase C-a
(PKC-a) in platelets.17 Moreover, some
studies have showed that direct antiplatelet
effects of statins are related to upregulation
of nitric oxide synthetase and suppression of
cyclooxygenase-1 activition.16,18 In our
study, we used isolated platelet suspensions
to exclude related factors, such as blood
cholesterol levels, as well as other blood cells,
which might interfere with platelet activity.
Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized by
cytochrome P450 3A4 to active metabolites,
including ortho- and parahydroxy atorvasta-
tin.19 Our in vitro study could not completely
provide physiological conditions and repre-
sent in vivo responses. This is because the
effects of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation

involve absorption by the intestine and
metabolism by the liver. Therefore, we specu-
late that metabolites might also have affected
platelet aggregation. The specific mechanism
of antiplatelet effects of statins remains to be
further investigated.
The present study showed that the effects
of atorvastatin on platelet aggregation
depended on the concentration of platelets.
Further studies are needed to demonstrate
the specific mechanism of the inhibitory
effects of statins on platelet aggregation.
