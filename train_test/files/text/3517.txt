development issues: Opportunities,
challenges, and concerns
Nir Kshetri
Abstract
This paper presents a review of academic literature, policy documents from government organizations and international
agencies, and reports from industries and popular media on the trends in Big Data utilization in key development issues
and its worthwhileness, usefulness, and relevance. By looking at Big Data deployment in a number of key economic
sectors, it seeks to provide a better understanding of the opportunities and challenges of using it for addressing key
issues facing the developing world. It reviews the uses of Big Data in agriculture and farming activities in developing
countries to assess the capabilities required at various levels to benefit from Big Data. It also provides insights into how
the current digital divide is associated with and facilitated by the pattern of Big Data diffusion and its effective use in key
development areas. It also discusses the lessons that developing countries can learn from the utilization of Big Data in big
corporations as well as in other activities in industrialized countries.

Introduction
Big Data (BD) is likely to be of tremendous benefit to
developing countries. It is anticipated that geo-locating
a rural African farmer working in his farm with the help
of an app installed in his cellphone, identifying the soil
type and needs of the field, and offering advice regarding
appropriate seeds, where they can be purchased, and
how they can be planted and harvested is not far in
the future (Patel, 2013). As another example, a retro-
spective analysis of the 2010 cholera outbreak in Haiti
showed that mining data from Twitter and online news
reports could have given the country's health officials an
accurate indication of the disease's spread with a lead
time of two weeks (Chunara et al., 2012).
Perhaps the greatest advantage offered by BD in the
context of development is that it helps us gain a better
understanding of the extent and nature of poverty and
devise appropriate policy measures. For instance,
mobile data can make it possible to better understand
the dynamics of slum residents. The call detail record
(CDR) and other information can provide insights into
the slum population, which would help forecast the
needs for toilets, clean drinking water, and infra-
structures (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). To take an
example, in Kenya's Nairobi, geo-coded cellphone
transaction data is used by the Engineering Social
Systems (ESS) project to model slums' growth, which
could help the government to optimize resource allo-
cation for infrastructural development and other
resources (Bays, 2014). Alternative data collection and
analysis techniques such as surveys have a very low
degree of usefulness for such purposes, which may
take months and even years for getting results and
are often out of date.
An encouraging trend is that the tools and expertise
that are employed to make decisions and take actions

related to behavioral advertising based on consumers'
real-time profiling are being used in addressing develop-
mental problems. For instance, data generated by social
media such as Twitter is being analyzed in order to
detect early signs that can lead to a spike in the price
of staple foods, increase in unemployment, and out-
break of diseases such as malaria. Robert Kirkpatrick
of the UN Global Pulse team referred to such signs as
``digital smoke signals of distress'' and noted that they
can be detected months before official statistics (Lohr,
2013). The importance of this technique is even more
pronounced if we consider the fact that there are no
reliable statistics in many developing countries.
Prior research indicates that information infrastruc-
ture has social, political, and economic dimensions
(Bowker, 1996). This argument can be extended in
obvious ways to include BD infrastructures. We argue
that different social, political and economic situations
and the current state of digital divide may give rise to
signiEcantly different rates of diffusion in industrialized
and developing countries. Unsurprisingly, there is an
enormous gap between the developing and developed
worlds in the utilization of BD.
One way to better understand this phenomenon is to
consider how the nature of the current digital divide is
associated with and facilitated by the pattern of BD
diffusion and its effective use. Hilbert (2014) notes
that the current inequality of technological capacity
represents a more mature and also more persistent
stage of the digital divide. Boyd and Crawford (2012)
argue that limited access to BD has created new forms
of digital divides. They note that the lack of money to
afford data is among many factors that may contribute
to the digital divide.
The international digital divide may account for the
differential rates of BD diffusion and its effective use in
industrialized and developing countries. In order to
better understand the diffusion and effective use of
BD in developing countries, it is thus first important
to consider the current stage of the digital divide.
Hilbert (2014) has identified three complementary
stages associated with the digital divide: access to a
technology, its effective usage, and social integration
and impact of the technology. The rapidly narrowing
access gap between industrialized and developing coun-
tries makes the last two stages more relevant. Prior
researchers have suggested that factors such as avail-
ability of skills and capabilities, social and cultural
attitudes towards a technology, the institutional
environment, and social reorganization are tightly
linked to the ability to use the technology effectively
and appropriately (Buente and Robbin, 2008;
DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001; DiMaggio et al., 2004;
Hilbert, 2014; Robinson, 2009). Many of these factors
can be considered as key components of a social
system, which is tightly linked to the diffusion of an
innovation (O'Neil et al., 1998; Rogers, 1995, 2003).
While there are some encouraging trends in the util-
ization of BD in addressing a number of social and
economic problems, developing economies are far
from achieving the full transformative potential of
BD. It is thus important for researchers and policy-
makers to have a deeper understanding of social, pol-
itical, and economic contexts that facilitate and inhibit
BD's diffusion and effective utilization in key develop-
ment areas. This issue also needs to be considered in
relation to the broader issue of the digital divide.
In light of the above observations, our goal in this
paper is modest and is simply aimed at deepening our
understanding of facilitators and inhibitors of diffusion
and effective utilization of BD in developing countries.
A related goal of this paper is to explore this issue in
relation to the current nature of the international digi-
tal divide. In order to achieve these goals, we present a
review of academic literature, policy documents from
government organizations and international agencies,
and reports from industries and popular media on the
trends in BD utilization in key development issues and
its worthwhileness, usefulness, and relevance.
Before getting to the details of this study, it is worth-
while to first clarify some of the key concepts. By
developing countries, we mean low-, lower middle-,
and lower middle-income countries in the World Bank
categorization (The World Bank Group, 2014). In order
to define BD for the purpose of this paper, we start with
the technology research company Gartner's definition of
BD, which are ``high-volume, high-velocity and high-
variety information assets that demand cost-effective,
innovative forms of information processing for
enhanced insight and decision making'' (gartner.com,
2013). With regard to volume, Boyd and Crawford
(2012: 663) note that BD is a ``poor term'' and argue
that BD ``is less about data that is big than it is about
a capacity to search, aggregate, and cross-reference large
data sets''. In this paper's context, we define BD as data
sets that can provide insights into human well-being,
which satisfy at least one of the following characteristics
compared to data sets that have been traditionally used
in developmental issues: (a) are of higher volume, (b) are
of wider variety, and (c) enable users to make decisions
and act faster. The paper is structured as follows.
We proceed by first discussing the methodology. The
section following that provides a theoretical framework
for assessing the diffusion and effects of BD in develop-
ing countries. Next, we analyze the characteristics of BD
in the context of development. This is followed by a
section on the emerging trends associated with BD util-
ization in development with a discussion of some present
and potential future applications. Then, we investigate
the opportunities and challenges of using BD for
2 Big Data & Society
development with the help of the case of agriculture and
farming activities. It is followed by a section on dis-
cussion and implications. The final section provides
concluding comments.
Methodology
The approach employed in this paper can be described
as a positivistic epistemology. Given the minute amount
of existing research on BD's use, particularly in develop-
ing countries, much initial research in this area needs to
be qualitative, concept-, and theory-building in charac-
ter. This paper thus takes such an approach.
Following the approach often used in positivist
research, this paper seeks to identify details associated
with BD use in developing countries. We have
employed three main sources for the reasoning in the
theory-development process: theoretical explanations
for ``whys'' and ``hows'' of BD diffusion; past empirical
findings; and practice or experience (Webster and
Watson, 2002). Among these, the logical reasoning is
the most important component of our explanations,
which provides ``the theoretical glue'' (Whetten, 1989:
491). We have also included empirical research related
to BD uses and from other related areas such as diffu-
sion of cellphones and other innovations. Next, BD-
related experiences of organizations (e.g. Land
O'Lakes, DuPont, AgriLife), nations (e.g. Kenya,
Uganda), regions (e.g. Latin America and the
Caribbean (LAC) economies, Africa), and development
agencies (e.g. UN Global Pulse team). In addition to
academic literature, we reviewed policy documents
from government organizations and international agen-
cies and reports from industries and popular media.
Materials reviewed also include reports of consultants
and suppliers of BD-related solutions (e.g. Monsanto,
Gartner, Cisco and McKinsey). In order to locate art-
icles, reports, and policy documents related to BD uses
in developing countries, we searched using various
combinations of keywords such as ``data'', ``Big
Data'', ``development'', ``developing countries'',
``Africa'', ``Latin America'', ``China'', ``India'',
``Nigeria'', ``Brazil'', ``Argentina'', etc. We limited our
search to materials published in the English language.
A theoretical framework for assessing
the diffusion and effects of BD in
developing countries
Characteristics of the technology and environment
affecting BD diffusion
Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that the
diffusion of an innovation is influenced by the environ-
ment, and characteristics of the innovation (O'Neil
et al., 1998; Rogers, 1995, 2003). Rogers (1995) identi-
fied various characteristics of a technology affecting its
diffusion pattern. Table 1 presents how BD performs in
terms of the various characteristics of an innovation
proposed by Rogers: relative advantage, compatibility,
complexity, observability, and trialability.
Regarding the environment, prior researchers have
noted that an innovation (e.g. BD) is embedded in a
social system, which plays an important role in its dif-
fusion. A social system is ``a set of interrelated units
that are engaged in joint problem solving to accomplish
a common goal'' (Rogers, 2003: 23). It varies in
forms--formal as well as informal.
Bowker (1996) provides further specification and
elaboration of the conditions under which new innov-
ations diffuse and thus extends Rogers' (1995, 2003)
framework. He argues that, in addition to the economic
dimension, information infrastructures also have
social (informal) and political (formal) dimensions.
Social systems also exist at different levels (individual,
organization, network, or national). For instance, the
social structure and communication structure affect
information flow and other factors that are critical
for the adoption of the innovation by the adopting
units. Various societal norms also affect the behavioral
patterns of the members of a social system.
Finally, the characteristics of the social system are
tightly linked to the real and/or perceived attributes of
an innovation (Rogers, 1995). For instance, due to
BD's potential role in promoting transparency, decision
makers in a social system characterized by secrecy and
distrust may view BD's attributes negatively.
International heterogeneity in the diffusion rates of
innovations
We start this section with a brief description of the
international heterogeneity in the diffusion rates of
innovations and the key sources of the heterogeneity.
Prior research indicates that organizations in a country
with a low degree of inter-relatedness with other com-
plementary technologies often find it difficult to obtain
the information and skills needed for a new technology
(Allen, 1998). Thus, countries with a small base of high
technology and innovative capital goods are likely to
experience lower rates of diffusion for emerging new
technologies (Antonelli, 1986). To put things in con-
text, wider and deeper adoptions of personal computers
(PCs), mobile devices, and other information and com-
munications technology (ICT) applications are likely to
lead to faster diffusion of BD.
Another source of international variation in BD dif-
fusion lies in the market and infrastructure factors con-
trolling the availability of the technology to potential
adopters (Brown et al., 1976). Prior research has
Kshetri 3
suggested that manufacturers of new technological
products are more likely to focus their efforts on large
distributors often located in developed countries
(Gatignon and Robertson, 1985). The environments
in developing countries are associated with adverse con-
ditions in terms of markets and infrastructures, which
are likely to slow down the diffusion of new techno-
logical innovations such as BD. For instance, a large
proportion of firms in developing countries may lack
readiness to adopt BD. Likewise, under-developed
infrastructures such as those related to weather fore-
casting and satellite-imaging technologies hinder the
use of BD in agricultural activities in these countries.
In order to provide insights into the above issues, it
is important to discuss the changing nature of the inter-
national digital divide. On the basis of a review of aca-
demic and practitioner-oriented writings on the digital
divide, Hilbert (2014) identifies three complementary
stages associated with it: access to a technology, its
effective usage, and social integration and impact of
the technology. The fact that over 90% of the popula-
tion in developing economies owned cellphones in 2013
means that the access-related digital divide has signifi-
cantly narrowed.
Nonetheless, developing economies face a number of
challenges that may limit their capability to utilize BD
effectively. A low degree of digitization is among the
biggest barriers. One way to measure digitization is to
consider Booz & Company's Digitization Index
(BCDI), which is based on 23 indicators such as
access, affordability, reliability, speed and usability of
digital services/applications, and users' skills. For
instance, the average BCDI score of emerging econo-
mies was 27 compared to developed economies' 54.
Booz & Company has described most emerging econo-
mies in the constrained or emerging stages of digitiza-
tion, whereas developed economies are in the
transitional or advanced stage (Strategy, 2012). In
these countries, there are limited hardware, software,
and other technology applications to generate and dis-
tribute relevant data and knowledge (UN Development
Program (UNDP), 2011). Moreover, the lower quality
of hardware, software, and infrastructure may lead to a
lower amount of information flow in developing coun-
tries. For instance, many businesses design websites
with features such as ``low-graphics'' and ``text-only''
to accommodate the needs of users in developing
countries.
It is also reported that most African countries use
accounting methods more than five decade old to gen-
erate vital statistics such as those related to gross
domestic product (GDP) (Bhushan, 2012). The World
Bank's study indicated that many countries in the LAC
region lack a strategic vision required for the overall
management of the statistical system (The World Bank,
2010).
Table 1. Characteristics of a technology influencing its diffusion: the case of BD.
Dimension Explanation Situation in developing countries
Relative advantage  Perceived benefits of a technology over previous
technologies and the extent to which it is better
than the idea it supersedes.
 Compared to traditional surveys (e.g. household,
labor market, living standard) Big Data involves rela-
tively shorter time to collect and analyze.
 BD initiatives are likely to reduce the costs signifi-
cantly compared to traditional surveys.
 SM (e.g. Twitter's API) is more appropriate to detect
crisis than traditional techniques such as interviews
and surveys (Madsen, 2013).
Compatibility  The degree to which a technology and the tasks it
performs are perceived as being consistent with the
existing values, beliefs, past experiences, and needs of
potential adopters.
 The initiatives such as Kenya's ODP are likely to be
incompatible with institutions filled with secrecy and
corruption.
Complexity  The level of difficulty of installing and using a technol-
ogy (variety and uncertainty increase complexity).
 There is a shortage of skills for data-related man-
power. People with the lack of appropriate technical
skills and qualifications may find BD techniques more
complex.
Observability  The degree to which the features and benefits of a
technology are visible, noticeable, and understandable
to self/others, the results can be described to non-
users.
 BD can help document quality standards of agricul-
tural products.
Trialability  The ability to experiment or try (on a limited basis)
before formally adopting.
 Organizations can try with small data sets to see the
appropriateness and effectiveness of BD projects.

4 Big Data & Society
Equality in access is a necessary but not a sufficient
condition to lead to digital equality. Factors
such as availability of skills and capabilities, social
and cultural attitudes towards a technology, the insti-
tutional environment, and social reorganization are
tightly linked to the ability to use the technology effect-
ively and appropriately (Buente and Robbin, 2008;
DiMaggio et al., 2004; Hilbert, 2014; Robinson,
2009). Factors such as the availability of skills and
the availability of social support have also been recog-
nized by DiMaggio and Hargittai (2001) as the key
dimensions of the digital divide. They have especially
emphasized the role of ``Internet competence'', which is
related to the know-how, technical skills and capacity
to exploit the Internet's potential by strategically
responding to challenges and opportunities
(DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001).
Finally, equality in usage does not necessarily trans-
late to social equality. Some groups of society are in a
position to benefit more from ICTs than others. This
implies the possibility of dominance by some social
groups and may therefore lead to ``an increasing
social divide'' (Hilbert, 2014). For instance, one com-
mentator noted that about 90% of the discussion at the
2013 Internet Governance Forum (IGF) referred to BD
as a surveillance tool. At the same time, the debate
focusing on developing countries treated BD as a
means to ``observe'' people to fight poverty. The argu-
ment provided by IGF participants was that data can
help provide access to clean drinking water, healthcare,
and other necessities (linnettaylor, 2013).
Some forces to overcome the adverse impacts of
markets and infrastructures
While manufacturers of new technological products
often find developed countries less attractive, prior
researchers have suggested that multinationals exploit
technological capabilities internationally by means of
activities such as export, movement of production
activities abroad, and licensing, which have driven the
globalization of technologies (Archibugi and Michie,
1997; Iammarino and Michie, 1998). Such forces have
been shown to influence the diffusion of Internet and e-
commerce related technologies, especially in developing
economies (Kshetri, 2001; Kshetri and Dholakia, 2002).
As noted earlier, transnational corporations (TNCs)
such as Monsanto and Syngenta are likely to drive
the international technology transfer of BD in the agri-
cultural sector.
Prior research has suggested that international insti-
tutions influence the global diffusion of ICTs in several
ways (Kshetri, 2001). For instance, they introduced the
Internet for the first time in many developing countries.
The UNDP introduced the Internet in more than 15
countries by connecting them to the global network
and deployed the Internet protocol (IP) network in
more than 40 countries (UNDP, 2001). By early 2001,
the UNDP also trained over 25,000 organizations and
created more than 40,000 websites for governments and
civil society stakeholders and 3000 national and regio-
nal thematic networks (UNDP, 2001). As noted earlier,
various BD initiatives have been undertaken by the UN
in developing countries.
Another encouraging trend is that there has been an
abundance of BD-related entrepreneurship in the
developing countries. This is important because, as
noted above, Western firms often find developing
countries to be less attractive markets. Firms in these
countries are rapidly emerging as providers of products,
services, software, and solutions related to BD (Kshetri,
2011). For instance, a technology developed by the
Brazilian company Cignifi can recognize patterns in
consumers' phone-calls, text messages, and data
usage, which are used to predict lifestyle and credit
risk profile (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). A study con-
ducted by India's National Association of Software
and Services Companies (NASSCOM) and CRISIL
Global Research & Analytics estimated that the
Indian BD industry was US$ 200 million in 2012,
which is expected to increase to US$ 1 billion in 2015
(Srikanth, 2013). Likewise, the AgriLife platform was
developed by Kenya-based IT company MobiPay and
was launched in late 2012. Mercy Corps supported the
expansion of AgriLife to Uganda and helped build rela-
tionships with other service providers and integrate
them into the platform, so they can reach rural clients
more effectively.
Characteristics of BD in the context
of development
Massive amounts of data generated by social media,
cellphones, and other digital communication tools,
which are being increasingly used in developing coun-
tries, are a true form of BD. While such data has not
been traditionally used in developmental issues, it is
likely to be a useful indicator of human well-being
and is thus a relevant BD source for development
(Global Pulse, 2012).
It is first important to explain what BD is and how
one can say that a data set used for a specific, develop-
ment-related purpose is BD. As noted earlier, Gartner
has defined BD in terms of three Vs: volume, velocity,
and variety. The software company, SAS, has added
two additional dimensions: variability and complexity
(sas.com, 2013). The following discussion will examine
how the various characteristics or dimensions of BD
identified by Gartner and SAS are relevant in the con-
text of developmental data (Table 2).

Volume
There has been a colossal increase in the digitization
rate of developing countries. Of particular importance
to the present discussion is the rapid diffusion of cell-
phones, which are probably the most important source
of data in the context of development. Whereas only a
little over a quarter of the population in developing
countries owns a PC, close to 90% owned cellphones
in 2013. One estimate suggested that the mobile data
traffic generated by subscribers in emerging markets
grew by over 100% in 2013 (cisco.com, 2014).
People with high disposable income in developing
economies tend to spend a significant portion on top-
ping up their mobile airtime credit. The monthly air-
time expenses can provide background of the
household income. This information provides guidance
on how to best target appropriate services through
advertising. It can be done anonymously. Monitoring
airtime expenses for trends and sudden changes pro-
vides a measure of the early impact of an economic
crisis and the impact of programs designed to improve
livelihoods (UN Global Pulse, 2013b).
Mobile phone-related data often provide high qual-
ity, valuable information because a mobile phone is
often the only interactive technology for most low-
income individuals. Moreover, it is easy to link
mobile-generated data to individuals, which can help
understand their needs and behaviors (World
Economic Forum (WEF), 2012). The frequency with
which calls are made and received with contacts outside
of one's immediate community provides an in-depth
understanding of the socio-economic class (UN
Global Pulse, 2013a).
Probably the most useful category of data is the
CDR, which is automatically generated by mobile net-
work operators for all mobile transactions. Each record
contains attributes of the transaction such as the start
time and duration of a call. In addition, the operator
records cell towers with which the phones of the caller
and recipient are connected. This information makes it
possible to use CDRs to know the location of both
parties (UN Global Pulse, 2013a). CDRs have a
number of potential uses. The information about cell
towers provides insight into the community's move-
ment patterns such as how people move from home,
work, school, markets or clinics. More importantly,
such information provides a basis for assessing the
potential spread of a disease into the area and the
movements of a disaster-affected population (UN
Global Pulse, 2013b). This information provides key
insight for relief efforts.
Cellphone transactions have been recognized as a
major source of data for developmental issues. For
Table 2. Relevance of Big Data dimensions in developmental issues.
Characteristic Explanation Some examples in the context of development
Volume Huge amount of data is created from a wide range of
sources such as transactions, unstructured streaming
from text, images, audio, voice, VoIP, video, TV and
other media, sensor, and machine-to-data.
Rapid diffusion of cellphones, social media, and other
technologies has led to the creation of huge amount
of data.
Velocity (fast data) Some data is time-sensitive and needs to be collected,
stored, processed, analyzed, and acted on quickly. In
some cases, speed is more important than volume.
Most decisions are based on data that are near-real-time
(e.g. AgriLife).
Variety Data comes in multiple formats such as structured,
numeric data in traditional database, and unstruc-
tured text documents; email, video, audio, and
financial transactions.
Structured and unstructured data are being used in a
number of developmental projects (e.g. Malaria
Surveillance & Mapping project in Botswana and
``Water Watchers'' in South Africa).
Variability Data flows can vary greatly with periodic peaks and
troughs. These are related to social media trends,
daily, seasonal and event-triggered peak data loads,
and other factors.
Variation of data flow is related to certain develop-
mental indicators (e.g. the correlation of the volume
of Tweets about staple foods and increase in the
cost).
Complexity Data come from multiple sources which require linking,
matching, cleansing, and transforming across systems.
By matching and linking data from diverse sources such
as CDRs, open portals, social media, government,
NGOs, and corporations (e.g. prediction of food
shortages by combining data related to drought,
weather conditions, migration patterns, market
prices of staples, seasonal variation in prices and past
productions), key insights can be gained regarding a
developmental issue.
6 Big Data & Society
instance, the characteristics of data related to microfi-
nance transactions such as the number and character-
istics of clients, loan amounts and types, and default
rate arguably fall between traditional development data
and BD (Global Pulse, 2012). With a more widespread
use of mobile and online platforms for microloan trans-
actions, a large amount of microfinance data can be
digitized and analyzed in real time.
Activity data generated by social media also consti-
tutes a major data source for developmental issues. For
instance, most of Facebook's growth in recent years is
coming from emerging markets. Among the 10 coun-
tries with the most Facebook users in 2012, six were
emerging markets. Five of them, India, Brazil,
Indonesia, Turkey, and the Philippines, accounted for
217 million Facebook users in 2012 (Mims, 2012). This
growth can be partly attributed to initiatives such as
Facebook Zero. Thanks to Facebook's collaboration
with mobile operators from a number of emerging
economies, users can access 0.facebook.com
(Facebook Zero) completely free. Facebook Zero con-
tains the key features of Facebook. A majority of users
in developing countries use mobile devices to access
Facebook. Most of these phones are feature phones
that operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, rather than
smart phones with app capabilities. Every Phone app,
which runs on around 3000 feature phone models
worldwide, has made it possible for these users to
access Facebook. As of July 2013, over 100 million
people used this app. Some telecom carriers in countries
such as India, the Philippines, and Indonesia offer free
or discounted data for Facebook Zero users (Byford,
2013).
Velocity
Velocity is considered as a ``competitive differentiator''
for businesses using BD (Laney, 2001: 2). In this paper's
context, BD provides the possibility for real-time feed-
back, which can lead to important developmental out-
comes. For instance, by monitoring a population in real
time, it is possible to understand the areas where devel-
opmental policies and programs are failing and make
required adjustments (Letouze
´ , 2012).
A number of initiatives that have been launched to
promote a BD ecosystem have focused on velocity of
data. In sub-Saharan African (SSA) economies, the use
of farm credits is reported to decline due to poor access
to financial services, high borrowing costs, and high
risks associated with such credits (Oluoch-Kosura,
2010). The creation of high-velocity data has helped
address some of these problems. For instance, as of
September 2013, the information created by AgriLife,
a cloud-mobile platform in Kenya which provides
financial institutions and suppliers ``near-real-time
information'' on farmers' ability to pay for services
(capacity.org, 2013), facilitated over US$ 2 million in
revolving credit lines to about 120,000 small farmers in
Kenya and Uganda (G-Analytix, 2013).
As another example, the World Bank's ``Listening to
LAC'' (L2L) initiative in Latin America deployed
mobile technologies to conduct real-time self-adminis-
tered surveys. The surveys collect life events data on a
near real-time basis and generate panel data. The data
is expected to inform policymakers on current indica-
tors and help them to respond more quickly and effect-
ively to key trends (The World Bank, 2010). The data
collection instrument is also expected to help policy-
makers assess the impact of their programs in real
time and observe coping mechanisms in situations
such as migration, school attendance, employment
patterns, and nutrition (The World Bank, 2010).
It is especially important to explain the benefits of
BD in the context of the lack of availability of data on
key developmental indicators. Most traditional devel-
opment data come from surveys (e.g. household, labor
market, living standard) and official statistics. In add-
ition to high costs, key problems of survey data include
a relatively longer time to collect and analyze.
Painfully, developing nations need to wait for a
decade or more to adjust the GDP or estimate poverty
indicators (Fengler, 2013). Data that is collected more
frequently, which is better organized, can help assess
the social and economic conditions faster.
Variety
It is important to first define structured and unstruc-
tured data. Structured data can be organized in an
assigned format that can be used by a database man-
agement system such as Oracle and Microsoft SQL.
Some examples include histories of mobile payment
transaction and the date of a Twitter account creation.
Such data can be arranged in a list, compared with
other data, used to generate new data, and retrieved
for decision making. Unstructured data, on the other
hand, is unformatted and lacks a predefined standard
structure (e.g. cannot be organized in terms of rows and
columns). Some examples include email messages,
social media posts, pictures, and video. It is also
worth noting that some sources involving interactions
between people and machines such as web applications
or social networks may provide multi-structured data.
For instance, web log data includes unstructured data
such as text and visual images and structured data such
as transactional information (Arthur, 2013).
Structured and unstructured data are being increas-
ingly combined in developmental projects. For
instance, the Malaria Surveillance & Mapping project
in Botswana was a pilot program launched in 2011,
Kshetri 7
which aims to move away from paper reports towards
mobile clouds. Health care workers are equipped with
mobile phones to gather and upload malaria-related
data to the cloud. The data can also be tagged with
structured data such as GPS coordinates and unstruc-
tured data such as pictures, video, and audio. If there
are signals of an outbreak of malaria, Ministry of
Health officials and other health workers in the area
receive a real-time notification via text message
(mhealthinfo.org, 2011).
Another remarkable example of the utilization of
structured and unstructured data is ``Water
Watchers'', a mobile application developed to report
water-related issues in May 2013 by IBM and South
Africa's City of Tshwane. One estimate suggested that
60% of water worldwide is lost due to leaky pipes
(Carew, 2013). The app's users take a picture which
shows a water-related problem and answers three ques-
tions about the problem. This data is then uploaded in
real time on a cloud server. The information generated
can be expected to identify a water ``leak hot spot'' map
(Carew, 2013). BD may hold a great promise for find-
ing appropriate steps to prevent or minimize this
wastage.
Variability
The approaches in BD assume that correlations can be
considered as pragmatic indications of relations among
variables (Mayer-Scho
¨ nberger and Cukier, 2013). In
this regard, one technique which has been of great
interest in developing countries is anomaly (or outlier)
detection based on the variability over time in the
amount of data flow related to a given developmental
indicator. Note that anomaly detection involves iden-
tifying items or events that fail to conform to an
expected pattern. The idea here is that items or events
that exhibit an anomalous behavior (e.g. unusually high
rate flow of data of certain categories) may be asso-
ciated with some kind of problem. To take an example,
the data formats used in Twitter's API are such that
they provide the dynamic anomaly detection features
(Madsen, 2013). The idea here is that the key metadata
used in segmenting Twitter data such as hashtags (#)
and replies (@) are user-generated and thus are logical
targets to follow in order to understand problems and
crises that users face. In sum, observing patterns of
anomalies inside the data flowing from the Twitter
API, one can detect signals of a crisis (Madsen, 2013).
One example to illustrate this point comes from a
research project undertaken by the UN Global Pulse,
which indicated that analysis of Twitter data can pro-
vide information on an increase in food prices. An ana-
lysis of a data set containing thousands of Tweets from
Indonesia discussing the price of rice indicated that the
volume of Tweets about staple foods had a positive
correlation with increase in the cost (UN Global
Pulse, 2013a).
Complexity
It would be helpful to first note that the really big dif-
ference between variety and complexity concerns mul-
tiple data types (variety) versus multiple sources of data
(complexity). Matching and linking data from multiple
sources such as CDRs, open portals, social media, gov-
ernment sources, non-governmental organizations
(NGOs), and corporations can provide a whole picture
of the economic and social conditions of the rural
population and thus valuable and relevant new insights
(bigdata-startups.com, 2013). To take an example, a
study of the ESS department of Harvard University
(hsph.harvard.edu, 2014) indicated that BD can be
employed to predict food shortages by combining vari-
ables from a number of sources such as drought, wea-
ther conditions, migration patterns, market prices of
staples, seasonal variation in prices, and past produc-
tions (bigdata-startups.com, 2013). As another exam-
ple, time-series analyses of CDRs can be combined
with random surveys to provide better insights about
the dynamics of rural economies and help devise appro-
priate government responses (bigdata-startups.com,
2013).
BD in development: Some present uses
and potential future applications
These are noteworthy and encouraging trends in BD's
utilization in developing economies. BD is playing an
increasingly important role in several key development
areas such as healthcare, agriculture, biotechnology,
education, and environment monitoring.
BD has been effectively used to evaluate and measure
the impacts of humanitarian aid and similar interven-
tions. One example is the UN's analysis of social media
posts to find out whether its Every Woman Every Child
(EWEC) initiative accomplished the goal of effectively
delivering the message to the target audience.
The UN trained a team to monitor and recognize
relevant Tweets. The EWEC team used the analytical
tool Forsight developed by the social media analysis
consulting firm Crimson Hexagon to analyze public
Tweets from September 2009 to July 2013. The team
developed a taxonomy of relevant keywords such as
``maternal health'', ``breastfeeding'', and ``vaccination
of children'' to identify messages that are relevant to
women's and children's health and searched these key-
words (Global Pulse, 2012, 2014). An analysis of mil-
lions of social media posts in a two-year period
regarding the extent and frequency with which relevant
8 Big Data & Society
keywords were used indicated a significant shift
towards an increased awareness of parental health
(Kirkpatrick, 2013).
In the pre-BD era, the principal way to measure the
impacts of humanitarian aid programs such as the
EWEC would be to conduct household surveys. It is
thus important to compare the performance of BD with
such surveys. In this regard, Table 3 illustrates how
different BD dimensions can be applied in the context
of EWEC's analysis of social media posts. Regarding
the volume, despite problems such as the relative lack
of randomness compared to household surveys, it is
possible to inexpensively extract a huge amount of
data from social media posts. Sometimes the final
results may take years since key processes in household
surveys such as visiting households for data collection
and entering data into a computer system are extremely
time consuming and expensive. Finally, such surveys
are not effective in collecting and analyzing unstruc-
tured data.
A similar use of BD has been in providing real-time
information on important social and economic indica-
tors. For instance, sentiment analysis can provide
insights into a community's attitude toward certain
key issues. To take an example, the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) (2013) showed that by
analyzing parents' social media posts, it is possible to
track attitudes towards immunization.
Another notable use of BD has been in the design of
an effective method and system for efficient distribution
and management of life-saving medicines that have lim-
ited supplies. One example is the World Health
Organization's (WHO) pilot program called SMS for
Life (http://www.rbm.who.int/psm/smsWhatIsIt.html),
which aims to improve the distribution of malaria
drugs in Tanzania's rural areas at the health facility
level. Demand for antimalarial drugs is highly unpre-
dictable. Such drugs cost as much as US$ 10 per course,
which is prohibitively expensive for most Tanzanians
(irinnews.org, 2009).
A creative feature of the process is that front-line
workers from every clinic send an SMS with their
stock count every week. Based on the figures sent by
the clinics, senior coordinating staff can determine an
appropriate target restocking level at a given clinic to
make sure that no stock-out occurs. The WHO
reported highly encouraging results. The proportion
of clinics with no stock of at least one antimalarial
medicine decreased from 78% to 26%. In one of the
three districts, stock-outs were completely eliminated
by week 8 of the pilot (Newton, 2012). It is worth
noting that the data used in SMS for Life is not as
big as that of the EWEC initiative. Nonetheless, by
aggregating and cross-referencing data sets collected
from a number of clinics and other sources, the pro-
gram has been able to improve the distribution of mal-
aria drugs. According to Boyd and Crawford's (2012)
definition, the data used in SMS for Life can be con-
sidered as BD for development.
Potential impacts of BD in enhancing transparency
The above discussion indicates BD's potential socioe-
conomic impacts in a number of domains and sectors.
Among the major impacts we may point out the BD-led
promotion of transparency and accountability. Note
that transparency involves making information about
an entity's operations, structures, and other attributes
available to the public (Finel and Kristin, 1999; Heald,
2006). Transparency has gained wide support among
state decision-making bodies, international organiza-
tions, and private companies (Finel and Kristin, 1999).
Governments can increase transparency by making
information available to the public. For instance, the
US government's launch of the website Data.gov in
2009, which makes statistical information collected by
Table 3. Relevance of BD dimensions in EWEC's analysis of social media posts.
Characteristic Explanation in the EWEC context
Volume The EWEC team analyzed about 14 million Tweets.
Velocity Utilization of user-generated digital content and Crimson Hexagon's analytical tool led to faster analysis and
decision-making.
Variety The analysis involved structured data such as the dates of Twitter posts and unstructured data such as Twitter texts
for the relevant keywords.
Variability There was a sharp increase in Tweets containing the keywords identified by the EWEC team during key events such
as World Aids Day, Mothers Day, International Women's Day and Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
summits.
Complexity Combining the Tweet data with data from other sources (e.g. Facebook posts) might offer further insights and
understanding of the EWEC initiatives and validate the results.
Kshetri 9
over 50 federal agencies available to the public, is con-
sidered as an important transparency measure (Etzioni,
2010). Among developing economies, Kenya is prob-
ably the most spectacular example in making data
available to the public and facilitating the use of BD.
In 2011, Kenya launched an Open Data Portal (ODP)
with the help of the World Bank. The project received
support at the highest levels of the government. The
data in the ODP includes a full digital edition of the
2009 census, government expenditure for 12 years,
household income surveys, and data about the location
of schools and health facilities.
A popular version of the theory of transparency is
that, thanks to their purchasing power, consumers play
a key role in controlling the economy by choosing the
businesses that are likely to succeed or fail (Sirgy and
Su, 2002). In order to exercise their power, consumers
like to have information about the attributes of the
goods they purchase. Manufacturers thus provide
information such as caloric value, types, and levels of
vitamins in the labels of food items in a product.
According to the transparency theory, this disclosure
enables consumers to make informed choices and
reward the businesses that provide the preferred prod-
ucts. This practice puts business disregarding con-
sumers' preferences at a disadvantage (Sirgy and Su,
2002). In this paper's context, developed country-
based firms are in a strong position to exercise their
power over farmers from developing countries. The
use of BD forces farmers to use less pesticide, which
is likely to help them enhance the quality of their prod-
ucts and stay competitive. As noted earlier, the avail-
ability of digital records of farming activities plays a
major role in documenting quality standards of agricul-
tural products.
Apart from the obvious direct economic effects, the
use of BD is also associated with a number of non-
economic benefits. Strengthening transparency by
making information public would help monitor and
discipline office-holders and fight corruption (O'Neill,
2006). Bentham (2001: 277) noted that ``... the more
strictly we are watched, the better we behave''.
Initiatives such as Kenya's ODP can thus be seen as a
key factor in strengthening the performance of govern-
ment and public administration in developing
countries.
Prior research indicates that transparency is likely to
be more useful when the level of information costs is
lower (Etzioni, 2010). In this regard, the rapidly falling
costs of collecting, processing, storing, and transmitting
data and information are likely to play major roles in
promoting transparency and accountability in the
public and the private sectors. This benefit is especially
stronger for small- and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) engaged in exporting products.
Opportunities and challenges of using
BD: The case of agriculture and farming
activities
One of the most important benefits of BD can be in
improving agricultural productivity. This effect is likely
to have tremendous developmental benefits as the agri-
cultural sector employs over 60% of the active labor
force in SSA economies (Oluoch-Kosura, 2010).
According to the UNCTAD's World Investment
Report (2009), over 900 million people in the world
were undernourished, and 65 countries faced ``serious''
or ``alarming'' danger of food shortages and famine.
Studies have suggested that ineffective farm operations
such as late planting/weeding, the lack of proper land
preparation and harvesting techniques, and poor hous-
ing and feeding for livestock can reduce smallholder
farmers' productivity by up to 40% (Oluoch-Kosura,
2010). BD has a potential to improve this condition.
According to Monsanto, the world's biggest seed com-
pany, tailoring information and advice to farmers could
increase annual world-wide crop production by about
US$ 20 billion (Bunge, 2014).
Some argue that BD is the source of the next revo-
lution in farming (Bunge, 2014). An overview of the
deployment of BD in industrialized countries would
be helpful for how the condition can be improved in
developing countries. On this front, precision agricul-
ture or precision farming has been a key trend in indus-
trialized countries. Data collected on soil conditions,
seeding rates, crop yields, and other variables from
farmers' tractors, combines, and drones is combined
with detailed records on historic weather patterns, top-
ography, and crop performance collected by the pro-
viders of prescriptive-planting technology (Bunge,
2014; foxnews.com, 2014). Human experts may need
to perform tasks involving decision problems and pro-
cesses for which no algorithm exists or the algorithm
has not yet been developed. In some cases, due to
unknowns no algorithm can solve all instances of the
problem. In agriculture, some examples of situations
include tasks involving unknown soil types, and
extreme weather conditions, which often need to be
performed by humans rather than algorithms. The
data is thus crunched by algorithms and human experts
and turned into customized useful advice and is sent
directly to farmers and their machines, instructing
them as to the optimum amount of pesticides, herbi-
cides, fertilizer, and other applications.
Many tractors and combines are guided by global
positioning system satellites. An article published in
usatoday.com explained that a corn and soybean
farmer in Iowa used a $30,000 drone to study how
the yield in his 900 acre farm is affected by changes in
topography and other factors (Doering, 2014). This
10 Big Data & Society
example is illustrative of a widespread adoption and
diffusion of BD in the agriculture sector in industria-
lized countries. Many farmers who have implemented
data-driven prescriptive planting based on the analysis
of nutrients in soil and other factors have reported a
significant increase in productivity (Bunge, 2014). The
point is that even small alterations in planting depth or
the distance between rows of crops can lead to a sig-
nificant increase in agricultural productivity.
The diffusion of BD is associated with and facilitated
by measures taken by the providers of prescriptive-
planting technology to strengthen their resources
and capabilities. In 2013, Monsanto acquired the
weather-data-mining firm Climate Corp. Likewise, the
agricultural cooperative Land O'Lakes bought satellite-
imaging specialist Geosys. In the same vein, in order to
provide real-time climate and market information to its
data service users, DuPont announced collaboration
with the weather-and-market analysis firm DTN/The
Progressive Farmer. In 2013, Deere agreed to send
data from its tractors, combines, and other machinery
to the computer servers of DuPont and Dow (Bunge,
2014).
Developing world-based small farmers face several
key challenges. Studies conducted in Sri Lanka and
other countries have indicated that farmers are not
able to sell harvests due to oversupply or not getting
the planned harvest, and the lack of necessary informa-
tion (Walisadeer et al., 2013). BD can help address this
problem.
Nutrient management is another area where BD may
be relevant. In Africa, outdated knowledge is pervasive
and ubiquitous in recommendations for nutrient man-
agement. This often leads to too much fertilizer in rela-
tion to potential crop demand and on a uniform basis
irrespective of the type of land (Giller et al., 2011). A
model-based and data-driven approach is thus likely to
reduce the costs of fertilizer and increase productivity.
A further area in which BD might have potential to
facilitate agricultural and farming activities in develop-
ing countries relates to the availability of near-real-time
data and information regarding farmers' needs and cap-
abilities, which can be used by value chain partners to
effectively serve the farmers. One example, as noted ear-
lier, is the cloud-based platform AgriLife, which is
accessible via mobile phone. It is used for collecting
data and analyzing farmers' production capability and
history. In order to ensure fast, easy and efficient avail-
ability of resources and services to distant, rural farmers,
the platform also acts as an integration point for finan-
cial institutions, mobile network operators, produce
buyers, and their agents (Yeoman, 2013). The data ana-
lysis provides a better understanding of small farmers'
needs and production capability. Service providers can
tailor their offerings such as crop insurance, input
payments, and savings accounts based on the data
(Yeoman, 2013). Uganda's Farmers Centre (FACE)
was an early adopter of AgriLife. FACE started upload-
ing information on its 10,000 farmer clients, who travel
long distances to purchase inputs and aggregate their
produce at FACE warehouses for processing/sale.
Before using AgriLife, FACE collected information by
paper-based questionnaires. Small farmers' transaction
data would help them build a credit history, which is
used by value-chain actors to provide credit and other
resources such as seeds, fertilizers, and pest-control
chemical agents (Yeoman, 2013).
As mentioned earlier, as of September 2013,
AgriLife facilitated over US$ 2 million in revolving
credit lines to about 120,000 small farmers in Kenya
and Uganda. The AgriLife platform is also being used
in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Senegal (G-Analytix, 2013).
Prior researchers have recognized that developing
world-based farmers face difficulties in meeting the
quality and safety standards set by the developed
world (Oluoch-Kosura, 2010). In this regard, the avail-
ability of easily accessible data that include digital rec-
ords of farming activities such as the amounts of seeds
and pesticides will obviously play a major role in docu-
menting quality standards of agricultural products. It
would be interesting to assess the above examples
related to the use of data in farming activities in
developing countries in terms of BD dimensions.
Obviously, higher volume of data on farming activities
is available than in the past. For instance, data such as
farmers' credit history and the amounts of seeds and
pesticides used was not available in the pre BD-envir-
onment. As to the data speed, near-real-time data and
information on farmers' needs and capabilities are
available. This means that financial institutions, pro-
duce buyers, and other relevant actors can fulfill farm-
ers' needs more quickly than in the past. Regarding the
variety, most data currently used in farming-related
activities is structured data. Such data can be combined
with unstructured data. For instance, farmers can
upload pictures and videos related to a problem they
are facing, which can be analyzed by experts to offer
customized advice.
In one way, TNCs are likely to be a driving force
behind the diffusion of BD in the agricultural sector of
developing countries. Large food and biotechnology
TNCs such as Monsanto and Syngenta already have
a notable presence in developing countries, which is a
positive factor from the standpoint of BD-led product-
ivity growth in these countries. During 2005­2007, the
share of agriculture in foreign direct investment (FDI)
inflows was 15.1% in Cambodia and 12% in Laos
(UNCTAD, 2009). Monsanto reportedly has control
of over 95% of the Indian cotton seed market (Vidal,
2011). TNCs, which are often producers, processors, or
Kshetri 11
traders of agricultural products or sellers of inputs or
machinery, engage in a contracting system in which
they assume a variety of responsibilities including pro-
viding technical assistance and marketing to developing
world-based small farmers (Glover, 1984, 1987). TNCs
such as Monsanto and Syngenta, which have become a
driving force behind the utilization of BD in the indus-
trialized world, are thus likely to act as a key channel in
the international technology transfer of BD.
A related point is that international technology
transfer in BD is likely to have differential effects
across different categories of crops. For instance, for-
eign companies are more active in newly emerging
export crops, which are integrated into the inter-
national supply chain. Traditional cash crops such as
coffee, cotton, tea, and tobacco are thus more likely to
realize the need to adopt various aspects of BD
(Hoeffler, 2006).
Other potential mechanisms and determinants of BD
diffusion among farmers also exist. For instance,
Oluoch-Kosura (2010) reported that NGOs, farmers'
organizations, and the private sector in Africa are play-
ing important roles in facilitating farmers' education,
access to agricultural information, and training.
International supply chain structures often tend to
exclude smallholder farmers. In Mozambique, farmers,
who are engaged in contract farming, pool resources to
get technical advice and other services. More than
400,000 smallholders with less than one hectare of
land each are reported to benefit from such arrange-
ments (Hoeffler, 2006).
Critical challenges and issues
Against the backdrop of rapid diffusion of BD among
big farmers in industrialized countries, a comparison of
their BD ecosystems with those of developing countries
would be helpful to understand critical challenges and
problems in the effective utilization of BD for develop-
mental issues. First, and perhaps most important, agri-
culture firms in the industrialized world have a long
history of data production and consumption. For
instance, DuPont has been making use of farm-level
data since the early 2000s (Bunge, 2014). Likewise, it
is increasingly common for farmers to monitor the pro-
gress of their agricultural activities on iPads and tab-
lets. In industrialized countries, firms in diverse
industries such as satellite-imaging, weather-data-
mining, and weather-and-market analysis have enabled
a rich ecosystem of BD.
While large growers can afford specialized machi-
neries, small farmers are not in a position to do so
(Glover, 1987). The conditions that stimulated the
growth of BD in the US farming industry such as the
widespread adoption of mechanized tractors,
genetically modified seeds, computers, and tablets for
farming activities are less prevalent in developing coun-
tries. Most smallholders in developing countries are not
in a position to do so. Smallholder farmers often have
no means to access the data and cannot interpret it. A
main concern is that BD collection efforts will only
benefit big and well-educated farmers (Palmer, 2012).
Accurate and actionable data require considerable
technical skills to handle data mining and analysis
method and system. The lack of human resources and
expertise represents another major barrier to the imple-
mentation of BD projects. Even industrialized countries
such as those in European Union (EU) economies have
reported a huge skills shortage for data-related man-
power (Kroes, 2013). Data scientists are both in short
supply and expensive to employ in SSA economies
(WEF, 2012). Most of the top BD companies are
from the industrialized world and developing competi-
tive indigenous companies in the BD area is not an easy
task for developing countries. The EU competition
commissioner Neelie Kroes noted that of the top 20
global BD companies, 17 are from the US and two
from Europe (Kroes, 2013). Another study suggested
that of the 15 most powerful BD companies, 14 were
US-based and one was Europe-based (Korolov, 2013).
It is argued that the highest performance computers are
unaffordable even to a member of the EU (Kroes,
2013).
As an upshot of the above discussion, there is a lack
of appropriate database systems for agribusiness devel-
opment, agriculture management, and produce distri-
bution. A BD attempt is greatly hampered by the lack
of reliable infrastructure to collect information.
Consider, for instance, climate-related historical data.
African countries have limited capacity to develop, gen-
erate, disseminate, and effectively use climate data and
information (Twomlow et al., 2008). National institu-
tions, leadership, and the civil society are inherently
weak and cannot determine the types of climate data
and information needed for agriculture and other eco-
nomic activities. Among the problems faced by policy-
makers and practitioners to work more effectively to
respond to climate changes and other climate related
effects concern extremely low number of meteorological
stations for climate data collection and the lack of digit-
ization of the data (United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate (UNFCC), 2007).
As another example, the lack of information has
been a main barrier to an effective implementation of
healthcare systems. For instance, while there is a rising
prevalence of diabetes in Indonesia, there is no data
available to measure the effects beyond intermediate
outcomes such as the number of people trained; per-
centage of health centers providing education; or devel-
opment of training material and guidelines (e.g.
12 Big Data & Society
training's impact on detection rate and outcomes and
screening's impact on complications) (Soewondo et al.,
2013).
Farmers are concerned about the potential misuse of
information at the firm level related to their farming
activities and at the industry level. For instance, the
trade group American Farm Bureau Federation
(AFBF) warned its members that seed companies' pre-
scriptive planting programs have vested interests in
higher crop yields associated with BD's use (Bunge,
2014). Big agricultural firms such as Monsanto might
influence farmers to buy specific seeds, sprays, and
equipment and are likely to profit from the costs of
their services and higher seed sales (Seppala, 2014).
The gathering of data from sensors on tractors, com-
bines, and other farm equipment by large seed compa-
nies is receiving the same level of attention as
immigration reform and water regulations (fox-
news.com, 2014). Another key concern that farmers
have expressed is that their data and information
could be used by competitors. For example, other farm-
ers' access to the crop-yield information may create
direct and unwanted competition to rent farmland,
which may cause a new spike in land values and seed
prices (Bunge, 2014). The issue regarding who owns
farmers' crop data is also of equal concern (Seppala,
2014).
Another fear is that Wall Street traders could use the
data to make bets that could hurt the farmers. For
instance, if conditions early in the growing season
lead to lower futures contract prices, it may reduce
the profits farmers could have made from crops by
locking into sell the futures (Bunge, 2014). Likewise,
farmers are concerned that hedge funds or big compa-
nies might use real-time data at harvest time from a
large number of combines to speculate in commodity
markets long before official crop-production estimates
are available (foxnews.com, 2014). This fear has some
foundation as the developments in BD technologies
make it possible to do so. For instance, a group at
the MIT Media Lab used location data from mobile
phones to estimate the number of people in Macy's
parking lots on Black Friday. The estimate made it
possible to estimate the retailer's sales on that day
even before Macy's had recorded those sales. Insights
like this are expected to provide competitive advantage
to Wall Street analysts and managers (McAfee and
Brynjolfsson, 2012).
In the developing world's context, an even bigger
question than that of whether agricultural productivity
can be improved using BD is who is likely to benefit
from the BD-led growth in productivity. One possibility
is that agricultural productivity associated with BD
utilization in developing countries may provide benefits
primarily to foreign companies. This is because while a
number of positive outcomes of agricultural TNCs'
operation in developing countries have been recorded,
there are also possible negative effects such as the
potential abuse of their market power and dominant
position. One estimate suggested that foreign investors
acquired (or sought) about 15­20 million hectares of
farmland in developing countries during 2006­2009
(UNCTAD, 2009). The increasing globalization of
agriculture and the food chain means that industria-
lized world-based agricultural giants may expand such
activities globally.
Security and privacy issues associated with BD have
attained at least some degree of institutionalization in
industrialized countries, which is a small comfort for
the farmers (Kshetri, forthcoming). Most industrialized
countries have more well-developed regulations related
to data privacy and security. They also have industry
standards, company-specific guidelines, and perform-
ance measures. For instance, US-based food and agri-
cultural companies such as Monsanto, DuPont, and
other corporations claim that they do not use data
for purposes other than providing services requested
by farmers, keep the data secure and do not sell it
(foxnews.com, 2014). Some companies get consent
from customers before sharing their data. The AFBF
has put together a ``privacy expectation guide'' to edu-
cate its members. In addition, it has drafted a policy
which has emphasized that data should remain the
farmer's property (foxnews.com, 2014). Some US farm-
ers are reportedly contemplating a new initiative to
aggregate data on their own so that they can decide
the type of information to sell and at an appropriate
price. Other farmers are teaming up with smaller tech-
nology companies in order to challenge the domination
of big agricultural giants in the prescriptive-planting
business (Bunge, 2014). Many developing countries
currently have no regulatory safeguard in place to pro-
tect farmers and citizens from possible data misuse.
This means that BD-related issues are being considered
in a setting of nascent institutionalization. Farmers in
developing countries are even more prone to exploit-
ation by big businesses.
Discussion and implications
Each generation has access to more information and
experiences more information overload compared to
the preceding generation (Blair, 2003). However, a
key feature of the recent information revolution is
that developing economies are experiencing a rapid
explosion of data and information due primarily to a
widespread diffusion of cellphones and social media in
these economies. If history is any guide, this explosion
is likely to change the ways individuals and organiza-
tions act and interact. In an analysis of the effects of
Kshetri 13
information overload from the 16th to the 18th century,
Blair (2003) found that the availability of more infor-
mation led to the diffusion and development of various
learning aids and tools and also affected the way scho-
lars worked. It is thus reasonable to expect that BD is
likely to have a profound impact on development-
related activities such as agriculture and healthcare
and related decision-making processes.
BD may have different meaning and significance for
the purpose of development. For instance, BD applica-
tions in developing countries may not necessarily
involve petabytes of data as used by TNCs such as
eBay and Walmart. They may also be characterized
by relatively lesser variety of data. Likewise, as to the
velocity dimension, a data-processing time of several
months may be considered fast enough.
BD is being used to understand and respond to
important development issues such as water supply,
food security, human health, conservation of natural
resources, and protection against natural hazards. The
above discussion makes it clear that while social media
activities have important social aspects and conse-
quences, SM data also has at least some economic
importance. There have recently been some encoura-
ging developments in the utilization of BD in improving
farmers' livelihood and access to services. The cases of
AgriLife and other initiatives indicate that BD has pro-
moted better functioning of the market.
Experts have emphasized the importance of assess-
ing organizations' ``information supply chain to iden-
tify and prioritize data management issue'' (Laney,
2001: 2). This is also relevant to development-related
data. Data in different contexts may come from differ-
ent combinations of sources. The composition and
structure of the data may differ across economies.
Among developing countries, Indonesia has the most
Twitter users (Richter, 2013). More Tweets come from
Jakarta than from New York, Tokyo, London, or Sa
~ o
Paulo (Florida, 2012). In Kenya, the mobile money
transfer is extremely popular and could serve as an
important data source (Kaplan, 2013; UN Global
Pulse, 2013b). Sixty-eight percent of Kenyan cellphone
users regularly use their phones to make or receive pay-
ments (pewglobal.org, 2014).
There is likely to be a wide variation across eco-
nomic activities and industries in the level of the diffu-
sion of BD. Even within an industry, differences in the
diffusion of BD are likely to be significant. For
instance, in the agricultural industry, cash crops that
are integrated in the modern supply chain are likely
to see the impacts of BD sooner.
Several important lessons can be drawn from the
successful examples. Initiatives in industrialized coun-
tries to develop a BD ecosystem should be instructive
for gaining an understanding of BD's impact on
development. The US Department of Agriculture, for
instance, announced the launch of a portal on the
Data.gov website, which links to 348 agriculture data
sets (Patel, 2013).
Prior researchers have suggested that social and
other forms of supports from more experienced users
are likely to promote technical competence of new users
(DiMaggio and Hargittai, 2001). In this regard, multi-
national companies and international agencies may act
as key forces in providing such supports to facilitate
BD diffusion in developing economies.
Political as well as economic factors are of crucial
importance in determining the distribution of benefits
resulting from the system (Glover, 1984, 1987).
Farmers who are able to mobilize and organize them-
selves (e.g. in cooperatives or other forms of groups)
may increase their bargaining power vis-a-vis TNCs
based in industrialized countries.
The conditions in developing countries provide
limited incentives to encourage the public and private
sectors to invest in the creation of relevant database.
It is important to develop means to make usable and
relevant knowledge available to smallholder farmers in
a timely manner. Data accessibility is more challenging
in developing countries. In light of the usefulness of
climate-related data as noted above, for instance,
more investment into climate observation networks is
needed. Historical and projected data on climatic con-
ditions would be of great help to farmers. While the
creation of a database that is completely customized
to meet the need of every field and every farm may
not be feasible in the short run, making information
available regarding a basis for even a broad categoriza-
tion (e.g. soil type) can be of great help. For instance,
in Kenya and Zimbabwe, while a wide heterogeneity
exists among farms, they can be arguably reduced
into three categories in relation to a response to fertil-
izers: (1) fertile fields unresponsive to fertilizers, which
require only maintenance fertilization; (2) intermediate
fields highly-responsive to fertilizers, which require
managing fertilizers efficiently; and (3) infertile fields
unresponsive to fertilizers, which may require complete
restoration and rehabilitation (Giller et al., 2011).
Providing advice and guidance to farmers based on
the responsiveness to fertilizers of their farms is
likely to lead to a more appropriate management of
fertilizer use.
Regarding the observation that high-performance
computers may be unaffordable to utilize BD effect-
ively, it is important to note an encouraging trend:
the diffusion of cloud computing in developing econo-
mies. These economies are experiencing dramatic and
significant cloud-led socio-economic transformations
(Kshetri, 2012, 2013). Global cloud vendors have
entered in developing markets and some high-profile
14 Big Data & Society
entrepreneurial firms are emerging in the cloud's supply
side in these economies. This means that individuals
and businesses in developing countries can effectively
utilize BD by renting storage and computing power
from the clouds.
Despite the optimistic promises that some consult-
ants and development experts have made regarding the
developmental and practical applications of BD
(Kirkpatrick, 2013; Laney, 2001; Letouze
´ , 2012), it
should not be viewed as a panacea and the answer to
all the many and varied problems facing the developing
world. There is a need to fully assess availability,
appropriateness, and effectiveness of BD in addressing
development challenges. There are only limited types of
data that can be found for most developing economies
(e.g. related to Tweets in Indonesia and mobile money
transfer data in Kenya). Data unavailability thus
remains a major challenge, which, according to Boyd
and Crawford (2012) has led to a new form of digital
divide. While appropriate analysis of BD may provide
valuable insights and information for key policy areas,
great care must be taken to ensure that data quality
standards are satisfied and appropriate methodological
steps have been taken. For instance, the use of Twitter
API data has been criticized on the grounds that it
suffers from questionable quality and serious methodo-
logical challenges such as samples of unknown repre-
sentativeness, a lack of one-to-one correspondence
between accounts and users and proliferation of
Tweets created by bots (Boyd and Crawford, 2012;
Crawford, 2009).
It is important to discuss the above problems in the
context of transparency. Whereas transparency is
essential to ensure reliability and validity, BD created
through the use of social media is often produced by
commercial organizations' closed structures (Driscoll
and Walker, 2014). For instance, Gillespie (2011),
pointing out the fact that Twitter engages in censorship,
has argued that users have displayed a ``misplaced
faith'' in Twitter Trends, and has urged them to stop
``worshiping algorithms''.
There are also important privacy and ethical issues
involved around BD. Acquisti and Gross (2009)
showed that combination of public databases can lead
to serious privacy violations such as revelation of indi-
viduals' social security number and other sensitive
information. What is particularly relevant in the con-
text of this paper, as noted earlier, is that some analysts
have a tendency to criticize some uses of BD in indus-
trialized countries on the ground that it is a surveillance
tool. On the other hand, these analysts' view is that
people in developing countries do not need privacy.
Some have challenged this view and pointed out that
poor people have no less reason than rich people
to be worried about surveillance (linnettaylor, 2013).
Moreover, in countries characterized by conflict,
crisis, and weak law enforcement, the privacy challenge
may be a security risk (Letouze
´ , 2012). In China, a
malicious actor reportedly can sell a database contain-
ing a specific type of information, for instance, phone
numbers, for more than US$ 1500 on the black market.
The illegal companies, in turn, charge their clients
between US$ 1500 and US$ 150,000 for services such
as private investigation, illegal debt collection, asset
investigation, and even kidnapping (Yan, 2012).
Limitations
Several limitations of this paper must be recognized.
First, some of the main arguments presented here rely
on the reports of companies which are consultants or
leading suppliers of BD-related solutions (e.g.
Monsanto, Gartner, Cisco, and McKinsey) and devel-
opmental agencies promoting BD (e.g. Global Pulse).
These companies may have vested interests in promot-
ing the diffusion of BD and thus may overemphasize
the positive aspects of BD. An additional limitation of
this research is that it covered only materials published
in the English language.
Policy implications
The above discussion suggests some important policy
implications which stress the need to emphasize the
enrichment of the BD ecosystem and to ensure that
appropriate regulations aimed at encouraging organiza-
tions' BD adoption in activities with positive social and
economic contributions and outcomes are in place. Due
to the public goods nature of data, organizations that
invest in data collection cannot necessarily reap all the
benefits. While some statistics are gathered several
times in different ways, others are rarely or never col-
lected (adb.org, 2013). Appropriate incentives are
needed to collect relevant data and overcome the frag-
mentation among the governments and organizations
collecting development-related data.
The government is a key actor that can drive the BD
ecosystem. Civic organizations, mobile app developers,
and media groups are using the data available at
Kenya's ODP to improve understanding of population
patterns and transparency of public services (WEF,
2012). Governments and international agencies need
to support the expansion of initiatives such as
Kenya's ODP in areas such as agriculture.
It is especially necessary to introduce policies, pro-
cedures, and interventions to ensure the privacy and
confidentiality of sensitive data. To return to the
Kenya example above, the ODP was put in place
without appropriate legal frameworks in key areas
such as protections for data reuse (WEF, 2012).
Kshetri 15
While Kenya's constitution guarantees openness, trans-
parency, and participation, which facilitated the ODP's
establishment, many authoritarian regimes lack such an
environment.
Data consumption and exchange are no less import-
ant than data production and analysis. Some argue that
the consumption of free data such as time spent on
social media and on cellphones may provide a ``con-
sumer surplus'' not captured in official statistics
(Letouze
´ , 2013). The utilization of BD in key develop-
ment areas hinges critically upon the availability of
manpower with BD competency. It is thus important
for national governments and international agencies to
direct more efforts towards developing BD manpower.
Guidelines, interventions, supports, and incentives
are needed to encourage sharing existing data. In this
regard, much of the valuable data that is relevant for
the development context is often with the private
sector. For instance, networks of mobile phone oper-
ators have data related to text messages, digital-cash
transactions, and location data. In some cases, the gov-
ernment owns these companies. One way to enrich the
BD ecosystem would be to persuade these organiza-
tions to make the relevant data available (Lohr,
2013). Universities and research centers also constitute
a key source of data and knowledge. It is argued that
scientists working in these institutes are against making
relevant data accessible due to security, privacy, and
other concerns. They often use reasoning against data
sharing, such as: ``I don't want to share it'', ``it's mine''
or ``It's government property'' (Patel, 2013). Analysts
have stressed the importance of providing incentives to
individuals to share information such as pricing/offers
and improved services. It is also important to develop
privacy standards and ``opt out'' ability (WEF, 2012).
Finally, for national governments and international
agencies such as the UN or the World Bank, it is critical
to engage in new and more comprehensive collabor-
ation with the private sector in order to facilitate the
diffusion and effective uses of BD in developing coun-
tries. Here we introduce the concept of ``Data
Philanthropy'', which is likely to play a key role in
the diffusion of BD in developing countries (Pawelke
and Tatevossian, 2013). This idea emerged at the WEF
in Davos in 2011. The basic idea behind Data
Philanthropy is simple: it involves a partnership in
which businesses share data for public benefit. Data
Philanthropy is described as the ``next movement in
charitable giving and corporate citizenship'' (Coren,
2011). Data donated by corporations and governments
can be used to track diseases, avoid economic crises,
and aid development. While a huge amount of data is
held by businesses, they are reluctant to distribute it
even anonymously, due primarily to privacy concerns
(Coren, 2011). It is thus important for national
governments and international agencies to work closely
with businesses such as Twitter and Facebook, which
have large amounts of data, and encourage them to
engage in Data Philanthropy.
Concluding comments
The data being used in a number of developmental pur-
poses can be considered as BD. Preliminary evidence
indicates that BD is likely to help better utilize the
scarce resources and can help deal with the various
sources of inefficiency that have been frequently cited
by critics as among the key obstacles for development
in developing countries. For instance, BD can help to
reduce the waste of inputs such as fertilizer and increase
agricultural productivity and control the epidemics of
various diseases.
Uses of BD that lead to positive social and economic
outcomes and those that benefit socially and econom-
ically disadvantaged groups need to be promoted.
Responsible uses of BD also require protecting people's
dignity and legitimate expectations of privacy and eco-
nomic interests. For instance, among the key lessons
from the overview of risks to farmers over possible
misuse of data and information in industrialized coun-
tries, these concerns are even more pronounced due to
the lack of data protection regulations in developing
countries. Moreover, most farmers in developing coun-
tries lack the degree of self-awareness and organization
that can be observed among some industrialized world-
based farmers. For instance, while farming groups in
industrialized countries are taking measures to protect
against misuse and exploitation of their data, such
measures are lacking in developing countries.
BD obviously offers a number of potential benefits
and vast possibilities in developed economies.
Nevertheless, developing economies are at a nascent
stage and far from a full utilization of the great poten-
tial of BD. Benefiting from BD requires a drastically
different approach. In order to overcome barriers
related to BD adoption, policymakers should ensure
various enabling conditions for the creation, availabil-
ity, and use of data. The lack of BD-related skills and
competency underscores the importance of moving the
focus beyond the numbers of technological devices to
the strengthening of national technological capacity to
use BD.
BD has not yet been a priority of policy issue for
most of the donor agencies nor has this issue been
closely tied to national development strategies. While
many organizations and data collection process in
industrialized countries constitute a rich ecosystem
and serve a wide variety of functions needed to achieve
various goals, most developing countries lack such
ecosystems. It would be critical for the developing
16 Big Data & Society
world's governments to get support from key stake-
holders such as researchers, international agencies, soft-
ware makers, data intensive sectors, and venture
capitalists to create and utilize relevant, development-
related data and information. Collaboration and
cooperation among these stakeholders are essential to
foster a data ecosystem for development. Creation of
appropriate databases may stand out as particularly
appealing and promising to some entrepreneurial
firms. Governments, businesses, and individuals are
willing to pay for data when they perceive the value
of such data in helping them make better decisions.
In the meantime, policymakers, academics, and other
stakeholders should make the most of what is available.
