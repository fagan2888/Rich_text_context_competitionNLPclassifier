Objective: To measure associations among depres-
sion, sexual risk behaviors, and sexually transmitted in-
fection (STI) among white and black youth in the United
States.
Design: Analysis of prospective cohort study data. Wave
I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
occurred in 1995 when participants were in grades 7
through 12. Six years later, all Wave I participants who
could be located were invited to participate in Wave III
and to provide a urine specimen for STI testing.
Setting: In-home interviews in the continental United
States, Alaska, and Hawaii.
Participants: Population-based sample. A total of
10 783 Wave I (adolescence) and Wave III (adult-
hood) white and black respondents with sample
weight variables.
Main Exposures: Chronic depression (detected at Waves
I and III) and recent depression (detected at Wave III only)
vs no adult depression (not detected at Wave III).
Outcome Measures: Multiple sexual partners and in-
consistent condom use in the past year and a current posi-
tive test result for Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae, or Trichomonas vaginalis (adulthood).
Results: Recent or chronic depression in adulthood was
more common for blacks (women, 19.3%; men, 11.9%)
than for whites (women, 13.0%; men, 8.1%). Among all
groups (white men and women, and black men and wom-
en), adult depression was associated with multiple part-
ners but not with condom use. Among black men, de-
pression was strongly associated with STI (recent: adjusted
prevalence ratio, 2.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-
4.43; chronic: adjusted prevalence ratio, 3.05; 95% con-
fidence interval, 1.48-6.28); having multiple partners did
not mediate associations between depression and STI.
Conclusions: Integration of mental health and STI pro-
grams for youth is warranted. Further research is needed
to elucidate how depression may influence the preva-
lence of STI among black men.

APPROXIMATELY 19 MIL-
lion new sexually trans-
mitted infections (STIs)
occur in the United States
each year,1 with nearly half
occurring in adolescents and young adults
aged 15 to 24 years.2 Improved under-
standing of factors that contribute to STI
in adolescents and young adults is needed
to assist prevention efforts.
Depression is a modifiable factor asso-
ciated with high-risk sexual behaviors and
STI among youth in the United States.3-10
While sexual risk behaviors and STI are
risk factors for depression,6,9,10 depres-
sion also may increase susceptibility to risk
behaviors and infection.11 Depression may
impair cognitive function and memory12-15;
decrease impulse control16,17; contribute to
psychosocial impairment,13 including emo-
tional reactivity in peer relationships18; re-
duce motivation13; and increase fatal-
ism.19 These depression-related effects may
inhibit clear perception of STI risk and the
ability to prevent risk behavior. Depres-
sion also is associated with substance
use,13,20-35 a consistent correlate of STI and
related behaviors.29,30,36-49 While depres-
sion and substance use may influence STI
risk by promoting high-risk sexual behav-
iors, adolescents affected by 1 or both of
these disorders also may be more likely to
have high-risk peers and sexual net-
works characterized by high levels of STI;
this may increase the risk of sex with an
infected partner50-52 and STI acquisition.
Diagnosis and treatment of adolescent de-
pression, important in themselves, also
may constitute a component of adoles-
cent STI prevention.
To our knowledge, only 1 study has
assessed the longitudinal relationship

between depression and STI among adolescents, using data
from Wave I (adolescence) and Wave II (1 year later) of
theNationalLongitudinalStudyofAdolescentHealth(Add
Health).6 In adjusted analyses, the presence of major de-
pression predicted STI among boys but not among girls.
An important limitation was that measurement of STI was
based on self-report. Add Health Wave III is available and
provides data on depression in adolescence and adult-
hood and on biologically confirmed STI in young adult-
hood. Given the limited research into depression and STI
from adolescence into adulthood, further study of depres-
sion and STI in the Add Health sample was warranted.
The purpose of this study was to measure the asso-
ciation between depression in adolescence and adult-
hood and sexual risk behaviors and biologically con-
firmed STI in adulthood using Waves I and III of Add
Health. We investigated whether the associations be-
tween depression and outcomes differed for men vs
women and for whites vs blacks, to obtain population-
specific information needed to maximize intervention
resources.
METHODS
Add Health is a prospective cohort study designed to investi-
gate factors of health from adolescence into adulthood.53 The
original study population was a stratified, random, school-
based sample representative of US middle and high school stu-
dents. During Add Health Wave I (1995), more than 20 000
adolescents completed a baseline interview assessing charac-
teristics that included sexual behavior and depression. Par-
ents were also interviewed. During Wave III (2001-2002), Wave
I participants were reinterviewed and urine specimens were col-
lected for determination of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisse-
ria gonorrhoeae infection with use of ligase chain reaction (Ab-
bott LCx Probe System; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park,
Illinois) and of Trichomonas vaginalis infection with use of poly-
merase chain reaction (Amplicor CT/NG Urine Specimen Prep
Kit; Roche Diagnostic Systems, Indianapolis, Indiana). The study
design has been described in detail elsewhere.54-59
We used measures from Waves I and III for this analysis of
depression and STI. Ethical approval for this research was ob-
tained from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
School of Public Health Institutional Review Board.
MEASURES
Exposure: Depression
Depression was assessed using a modified version of the Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).60 The
original CES-D is composed of 20 items, each of which as-
sesses the frequency of experiencing depressive symptoms in
the past week (responses are rated as 0, never or rarely; 1, some-
times; 2, a lot of the time; or 3, most of the time/all of the time).
Four items assess positive symptoms (eg, frequency of happi-
ness, whether one enjoys life) and are reversed before the score
is computed. The composite score (based on the 20-item CES-D)
ranges from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating increased
severity of depression. The scores of 24 for females and 22 for
males have been determined to be sensitive and specific indi-
cators of major depressive disorder among adolescents.61
We used a modified version of the CES-D composed of a
subset of 9 items common to both Waves I and III (eSupple-
ment; http://www.archpediatrics.com) to calculate each par-
ticipant's depression score at Wave I and at Wave III (possible
score range, 0-27).
Following the methods of Shrier et al,5,6 we identified sex-
specific cut points for major depressive disorder based on a modi-
fied CES-D that were proportional to the cut points for major
depressive disorder based on the complete 20-item CES-D.61
With our 9-item CES-D, scores of 9.9 among males and 10.4
among females indicated major depressive disorder. For con-
venience, we identified male or female respondents with a score
of 10 or greater as having a high likelihood of major depres-
sive disorder. We subsequently refer to this high likelihood of
major depressive disorder as "depression."
Based on our categorizations of depression at Waves I and
III, we defined a 3-level depression exposure variable. We coded
respondents with depression in adulthood (Wave III) who also
had depression in adolescence (Wave I) as having chronic de-
pression, respondents with depression in adulthood (Wave III)
who did not have depression in adolescence (Wave I) as hav-
ing recent depression, and respondents who were not de-
pressed in adulthood (Wave III) as having no adult depression.
Outcomes: Sexual Risk Behaviors
and STI (Wave III)
We measured associations between recent and chronic depres-
sion and the following sexual risk behaviors in the year before
Wave III: 2 or more sexual partners, 6 or more sexual part-
ners, 10 or more sexual partners, 0% condom use, and less than
100% condom use (yes vs no). We also examined the associa-
tion between depression and biologically confirmed STI at Wave
III (a positive test result for C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, or
T vaginalis on Wave III urine specimen vs a negative result for
all 3 tests).
POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES
We considered each of the following covariates as a potential con-
founding variable based on its a priori causal relationship with
the exposure and outcome: age; marital history; maternal edu-
cation measured by Wave I self-report if the mother was inter-
viewed, otherwise by adolescent's report; Wave III low func-
tionalincomestatusinthepastyear;ageatfirstvaginalintercourse;
self-reported STI at Wave I (self-report of diagnosis with chla-
mydial infection, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis, syphilis, genital her-
pes, or human immunodeficiency virus vs no self-reported STI
diagnosis); Wave I frequent alcohol consumption in the past year,
defined as drinking at least 3 days per week; Wave I lifetime mari-
juana use; and Wave I lifetime crack or cocaine use.
DATA ANALYSIS
For all analyses, we used survey commands in Stata Version
9.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) to account for stratifi-
cation, clustering, and unequal selection probabilities, yield-
ing nationally representative estimates.
We used bivariable analyses to calculate weighted preva-
lences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of Wave III STI by
demographic,socioeconomic,mentalhealth,andbehavioralvari-
ables.Wealsoinvestigatedwhetherdepressionandmentalhealth
care differed between whites and blacks.
We estimated unadjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95%
CIs for associations between depression and outcomes (mul-
tiple partner indicators, condom use indicators, and STI) by
sex and race (white vs black) using a Poisson model without
an offset, specifying a log link and probability weights.62,63 Ad-
justed models included demographic, socioeconomic, depres-
sion, and adolescent STI risk and substance use variables.

Among populations in which we observed an association
between depression and sexual risk behaviors (indicators of mul-
tiple sexual partners or inconsistent condom use) as well as STI,
we explored whether the behavioral variables predicted by de-
pression were mediators of the depression-STI relationship. We
compared associations between depression and STI adjusted
for original confounding variables with associations further ad-
justed for the intermediate sexual behavior determinants. If the
associations between depression and STI were attenuated on
further adjustment for the behavioral intermediates, we as-
sumed these variables mediated the association between de-
pression and STI.
RESULTS
Of the 18 924 participants in the weighted Wave I sample,
14 322 (75.7%) were located and reinterviewed during
Wave III and had no missing values for sample weight
variables.

We conducted analyses among the 10 783 respon-
dents with complete sample weight variables. Of these,
the 8794 Wave III participants (81.6%) with a result for
all 3 tests (C trachomatis, N gonorrhoeae, and T vagina-
lis) were included in the analyses of depression and STI.
WAVE III STI PREVALENCE
BY RESPONDENT CHARACTERISTICS
Of the respondents in the analytic sample, 50.4% were
men and 49.6% were women; their mean age was 21.8
years; and 80.9% were white and 19.1% were black
(Table 1).
TheoverallweightedprevalenceofinfectionatWaveIII
withCtrachomatis,Ngonorrhoeae,orTvaginaliswas6.1%
(95%CI,5.0%-7.2%)(Table1).TheprevalenceofSTIwas
higherinwomenthaninmen(unadjustedoddsratio,1.61;
95% CI, 1.32-1.96) and markedly higher in blacks than in
whites (odds ratio, 6.99; 95% CI, 5.38-9.09).
DEPRESSION AND MENTAL HEALTH CARE
Of the total Wave III sample, 11.5% had depression in
adulthood: 7.2% had recent depression and 4.3% had
chronic depression. Prevalence of recent or chronic de-
pression was highest among black women (19.3%), fol-
lowed by white women (13.0%), black men (11.9%), and
white men (8.1%) (Table 1). Among those who were cat-
egorized as having recent or chronic depression at Wave
III, blacks were much less likely than whites to report
having received psychological or emotional counseling
(blacks: 10.1%, whites: 20.9%) or prescription medica-
tion for depression or stress (blacks: 5.4%, whites: 17.0%)
in the year before the survey.
DEPRESSION AND MULTIPLE PARTNERS
IN THE PAST YEAR
White Men
Among white men, neither recent nor chronic depres-
sion vs no adult depression was associated with having
2 or more partners in the past year in bivariable analy-
ses and analyses adjusting for demographic, socioeco-
nomic, and adolescent STI risk and substance use vari-
ables (recent: adjusted PR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.96-1.56;
chronic: adjusted PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.79-1.62) (Table 2).
While recent depression was not associated with hav-
ing 6 or more partners in the past year (adjusted PR, 1.15;
95% CI, 0.46-2.87), chronic depression appeared to be as-
sociatedwiththisoutcome(adjustedPR,2.15;95%CI,0.90-
5.15). This estimate was imprecise due to the low number
ofchronicallydepressedwhitemenavailablefortheanalysis.
Recent and chronic depressions were not associated
with having 10 or more partners in the past year (re-
cent: adjusted PR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.12-2.61; chronic: ad-
justed PR, 1.66; 95% CI, 0.23-12.0).
White Women
Among white women, recent depression was moderately
associated with having 2 or more partners in the past year
(adjusted PR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.19-1.77) (Table 2). Chronic
depression was weakly and insignificantly associated with
this outcome (adjusted PR, 1.24; 95% CI, 0.90-1.70).
Inthisgroup,recentandchronicdepressionswerestrongly
associated with having 6 or more partners in the past year
(recent:adjustedPR,2.13;95%CI,1.06-4.25;chronic:ad-
justed PR, 2.40; 95% CI, 0.98-5.90) and 10 or more part-
nersinthepastyear(recent:adjustedPR,6.87;95%CI,2.53-
18.6; chronic: adjusted PR, 8.42; 95% CI, 3.23-22.0).
Black Men
Amongblackmen,recentdepressionwasnotassociatedwith
having2ormorepartnersinthepastyear(adjustedPR,0.88;
95% CI, 0.67-1.16) (Table 2). Chronic depression was not
associated with having 2 or more partners in the past year
inunadjustedanalyses(unadjustedPR,1.10;95%CI,0.73-
1.67) but was weakly associated with this outcome in ad-
justed analyses (adjusted PR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.96-1.95).
In this group, recent depression was not associated with
having 6 or more partners in the past year (adjusted PR,
1.06; 95% CI, 0.53-2.11). While chronic depression was
not associated with having 6 or more partners in the past
year in bivariable analyses (unadjusted PR, 1.74; 95% CI,
0.66-4.54), it was strongly associated with the outcome in
adjusted analyses (adjusted PR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.05-5.82).
Among black men, recent and chronic depressions
were not associated with having 10 or more partners in
the past year (recent: adjusted PR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.12-
2.11; chronic: adjusted PR, 2.23; 95% CI, 0.77-6.47).
Black Women
Black women with recent or chronic depression did not
appear to have a higher prevalence of 2 or more partners

than black women with no depression (adjusted PR,
0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.76).
In this group, small stratum-specific sample size pre-
vented estimation of the associations between depres-
sion and having 10 or more partners in the past year.
DEPRESSION AND CONDOM USE
IN THE PAST YEAR
In all subgroups, recent and chronic depressions were
not associated with inconsistent condom use (100%
condom use or 0% condom use) (Table 3).
DEPRESSION AND STI
White Men
Among white men, STI was not associated with recent de-
pression(adjustedPR,0.47;95%CI,0.15-1.51)orchronic
depression(adjustedPR,0.77;95%CI,0.16-3.72)(Table4).
White Women
Among white women, STI was not associated with re-
cent depression (adjusted PR, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.54-2.77)
(Table 4). White women with chronic depression had
lower levels of STI than those with no depression in adult-
hood (adjusted PR, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.81).
Black Men
Among black men, STI was strongly associated with re-
cent and chronic depressions in unadjusted analyses

INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL RISK BEHAVIORS
THAT MEDIATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN
DEPRESSION AND STI AMONG BLACK MEN
Does engagement in multiple partnerships mediate the
depression-STI relationship among black men? Among
black men, chronic depression was associated with mul-
tiple sexual partners and STI. We sought to identify
whether multiple partners mediated the relationship be-
tween chronic depression and STI. In analyses adjusted
for original confounding factors and for variables hy-
pothesized to mediate the depression-STI association (in-
dicators of having 2, 6, or 10 partners in the past year),
the association was not attenuated. In fact, the associa-
tion between chronic depression and STI somewhat
strengthened (adjusted PR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.89-6.24). Hav-
ing 6 or more partners in the past year did not mediate
the association between chronic depression and STI.
Although recent depression was associated with STI
among black men, it was not associated with multiple
partners or condom use. Other sexual behaviors or non-
behavioral factors not measured in this study appeared
to account for the strong association between recent de-
pression and STI.
COMMENT
Among this nationally representative sample, white and
black young adults with recent or chronic depression were
much more likely to have multiple sexual partners, an
important determinant of STI, than were those identi-
fied as having no depression in adulthood. In black men,
depression was associated with 2 to 3 times the preva-
lence of STI. In all groups, associations between depres-
sion and STI-related behaviors and infection remained
when adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and ado-
lescent STI risk and substance use variables, suggesting
that depression may influence STI risk independent of
these factors. Because our analysis included compo-
nents of a longitudinal study, including measurement of
depression from adolescence and control of baseline STI
risk, we interpret these findings to suggest that depres-
sion through adolescence likely contributed to STI risk
among young adults. Our observations support earlier
findings that depression appears to predict STI and re-
lated behaviors among adolescents and young adults.6,9
Given the strong associations between depression and STI
risk, these findings highlight a need for improved inte-

gration of mental health and STI screening and preven-
tion programs for adolescents and young adults in white
and black communities.
For black men, although chronic depression was
associated with having multiple sexual partners, this
behavior did not appear to mediate the association
between depression and STI. Other factors underlie the
association between depression and STI in black men. It
is possible that chronic depression contributed to other
sexual risk-taking behaviors that we did not measure.
In addition, chronically depressed black men may have
high-risk social and sexual networks and, hence, expe-
rience greater risk of coming into contact with an
infected sexual partner than do black men who are not
depressed. This may be the case, in part, because
depression is strongly associated with substance
use,13,20-35 and substance users have networks with high
levels of STI.50-52 This study has pointed to a robust
association between depression and STI risk in black
men. Because this study has not elucidated the mecha-
nisms through which depression may increase the
prevalence of STI in this group, it highlights the need
for further research into the effects of depression on STI
risk for black men and their sexual partners.
For all groups (white men and women, and black men
andwomen),depression-relatedincreasesinmultiplepart-
ners did not appear to translate into higher infection lev-
els. For whites, this finding was not surprising given the
low prevalence of infection in white sexual networks.
However, if infection were introduced into sexual net-
works of recently and chronically depressed whites, de-
pression-associated increases in multiple partners may
facilitate STI transmission.
Forblacks,althoughdepressionwasassociatedwithhav-
ing multiple partners, the prevalence of STI was alarm-
ingly high among blacks with both high and low levels of
depression and multiple partners. These findings validate
an earlier Add Health study that found STI prevalence is
disproportionately high in blacks compared with that in
whites, even in blacks with relatively low levels of risk be-
haviors.66 The study concluded that factors other than in-
dividual-levelriskbehaviorslikelydrivehighinfectionrates
inblacks.Sexualmixingbetweenhigh-andlow-riskgroups
ismuchmorecommonforblacksthanforwhitesandlikely
contributes to disproportionate STI transmission in black
populations.66 It is possible that structural and contextual
factors play a more important role than individual-level be-
haviors in driving STI transmission in blacks, by contrib-
uting to sexual mixing patterns and the concentration of
infection in black communities.
The prevalence of depression was higher for blacks than
for whites, and we observed a race differential in levels of
counseling and treatment for depression. These differ-
ences support existing evidence of a race disparity in men-
tal health care67-69 and further indicate that undiagnosed,
untreateddepressionconstitutesanimportantpublichealth
concern for blacks. These results documented the high
prevalence of depression and inadequate diagnosis of and
care for mental health needs in blacks, as well as strong as-
sociations between depression and STI risk in this group,
highlighting the importance of improving mental health
care in black communities.
The most important limitation of this research was our
inability to conduct a fully longitudinal study, because
we sought to examine chronic depression from adoles-
cence into adulthood and STI in adulthood. In particu-
lar, the long time between data collection in adoles-
cence (Wave I) and young adulthood (Wave III) limited
our ability to definitively assess the causal role of depres-
sion in sexual risk behavior and STI. To establish whether
adolescent depression is causally associated with acqui-
sition of STI in adulthood among blacks, a longitudinal

study should be conducted to accurately measure de-
pression, STI, and important covariates such as sub-
stance use at frequent intervals to disentangle the spe-
cific effects of each variable of interest on STI.
This research was also potentially limited by our use
of the CES-D. Our 9-item modified CES-D was not vali-
dated against a clinical diagnosis of depression, which
may have resulted in misclassification of depression. Fur-
thermore, we assumed that the CES-D functioned simi-
larly in white and black groups. While some research has
shown that the CES-D measures differing underlying phe-
nomena for different racial/ethnic adolescent groups,70
other studies have suggested that the scale functions com-
parably in both white and African American popula-
tions71 and has good sensitivity and moderate specific-
ity to detect depression in black populations.72
This study provided further evidence that US youth
at high risk for STI also experience a disproportionate
risk of depression, highlighting the need for improved
integration of mental health and STI diagnosis, treat-
ment, and prevention. Because levels of depression and
STI were higher and the associations between these vari-
ables were stronger for blacks than for whites, black youth
should be a priority when allocating resources to im-
prove mental health care. Improved diagnosis and care
for depression are needed not only because depression
constitutes an important public health concern in itself
but also because addressing depression may lead to im-
proved physical health, including lower risk for STI.
