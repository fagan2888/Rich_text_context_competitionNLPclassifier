Big Data and historical social science
Peter Bearman
Abstract
``Big Data'' can revolutionize historical social science if it arises from substantively important contexts and is oriented
towards answering substantively important questions. Such data may be especially important for answering previously
largely intractable questions about the timing and sequencing of events, and of event boundaries. That said, ``Big Data''
makes no difference for social scientists and historians whose accounts rest on narrative sentences. Since such accounts
are the norm, the effects of Big Data on the practice of historical social science may be more limited than one might wish.
Keywords
Big Data, historical social science
Pretty much at the same time as network scientists have
been discovering power laws and other connectivity-
based epiphenomenal features of social networks in
the digital exhaust of on-line searches, social media
friendship choices, purchase recommendations, product
reviews and the like, historians have been quietly build-
ing massive archival data structures from the extant
records of crucially important institutions and contexts
and making those data structures available to the
public. These include--and this is only an idiosyncratic
sample drawn mainly from Britain--the complete text
record of the Old Bailey, the extant records of the
Atlantic slave trade, and the British East India
Company. With the simplest of search strategies
answers to descriptive questions that the lone historian
poring through a dusty archive could barely imagine
possible are now achievable in a matter of days, per-
haps hours, or even minutes. How will these Big Data
archives and many others change our understanding of
the past, and hence our present?
As these archives come on-line, with even less fan-
fare than the newest study showing that the day length
has an influence on people's emotions indexed by the
proportion of happy over sad tweets, vast textual cor-
pora spanning long periods of time are now becoming
widely available in digital form. And not surprisingly,
these textual corpora (once again providing only an
idiosyncratic sample from the United States--State of
the Union (SoU) speeches, the Congressional Record,
transcripts of Supreme Court decisions) also arise from
important institutions whose form is largely continuous
over often very long periods of time.1 Can we answer old
questions in new ways from these old texts?
Similarly, cultural objects such as photographs,
menus from New York City restaurants, seating
charts for the New York Philharmonic, also previously
largely inaccessible, are increasingly made available in
on-line repositories (Accominetti and Khan, 2015).
Most of these data are precisely time-stamped and
much of it can be precisely geo-referenced. Do these
new cultural repositories make possible changed under-
standings of crucially important dynamics such as elite
formation, ethnic group integration, disease diffusion and
even long-term climate change?
And we are just at the beginning of the archival
revolution. Historical archives of enormous significance
are being digitized rapidly. Equally amazing, new arch-
ives of unknown importance but on a massive scale--
for example, the two billion annual emails to and from
the department of state under Clinton--dwarf the
number of unique documents that ever existed from

the entire Lincoln administration.2 Does any of
this matter for what historians and historical social
scientists do?
Not surprisingly, the answer is no and yes.
Golder and Macy report (2011), as quoted in this
volume by Breiger, that ``the web sees everything and
forgets nothing''. As a fantasy this is not so different
from the ideal chronicle that records everything ``just as
it happened, as it happened'' imagined in 1968 by
Arthur Danto (1968) who wondered whether such a
chronicle would change anything of significance that
historians do. Danto acknowledges that after doing
whatever historians do in the archives that the existence
of such a chronicle would allow them to instantly check
their facts, but this is at best a trivial element of their
practice. What historians do uniquely is write narrative
sentences--sentences such as ``on Christmas Eve 1642,
the father of modern physics was born''--and a chron-
icle that recorded everything that happened just as it
happened would not be of any use for such an activity,
for only after modern physics was born could Newton
be its father. The web or the chronicle that saw every-
thing and forgot nothing would record absolutely faith-
fully that on Christmas Eve 1642 Isaac Newton was
born. But it could never record at the moment that
some hundreds of years later he would father modern
physics. So for this central activity of the historian's
craft--the writing of narrative sentences--our new
data structures will be of little importance.
But for a social science history not concerned with
writing such sentences, these data structures may
induce across a wide array of substantive problems of
note a radical re-imagination of the past, and conse-
quently a radical reorganization of our understanding
of the present because they invite and provide supports
for a new kind of history, one focused less on dynamics,
pattern recognition, and the identification of the mech-
anisms by which the actions of actors cumulate into
macro-level outcomes. Think of our deepest intellectual
problems--for example, something like the emergence
of ``modern society''. What could Big Data contribute
to our understanding?
Jose Atria--a PhD student at Columbia--is working
on using the Old Bailey archive to answer just that
question (2015). The starting point for this project is
his observation that historians and social scientists
agree that a whole set of process widely believed to
have started in the 16th century resulted in the emer-
gence of modern society. There is no question about
this. Atria (2015) writes:
These include changes like the emergence of ways of life
that made violence and the body seem repugnant and
shameful (Elias, 2000), the development of centralized
state authority and the emergence of national
communities beyond direct bonds of kinship
(Bearman, 1993; Anderson, 2006; Tilly, 1975), the
development of market society (Polanyi, 2001), the dis-
solution of traditional social relationships based on
status in favor of a social structure based on
social classes (Thompson, 1963), and the emergence
of disciplinary methods of control and power
(Foucault, 1977).
Others could be added, of course, but this is a sufficient
set for our purposes and the key issue is not that there
may be others, but that even though there is agreement
about the fact that these processes are central, there is
very little agreement about the structure of the causal
connections between them.3 And answering that ques-
tion--which can be decomposed into a series of other
critical questions, such as: How did the various semi-
autonomous processes involved in the emergence of
modern society interact with one another? Which
changes came first? Which followed either in timing
of onset or speed of change?--is where ``Big Data''
(in this case, the Old Bailey archive) comes into play.
Importantly, the Old Bailey archive arises directly
from an institution that is absolutely central to all of
the critical processes that constitute modernity's emer-
gence. Other institutions play equally critical roles. An
often observed character of historical data and also true
for big historical data that promises to change what we
know about causal dynamics in historical context is
that it arises from institutional contexts strongly impli-
cated in those processes. Things that were preserved
more often than not are things that people then
believed worth preserving. The archive, which covers
the period from 1674 to 1913 (this is, after all, a
period bounding the emergence of modernity) contains
precise time-stamped data on millions of unique per-
sons, thousands of places, and hundreds of thousands
of interactions, both criminal and quotidian. Indexed in
these records are precise relational data structures that
enable one to focus on changing patterns of social rela-
tions, the social geography of violence, the displace-
ment of kinship, the breakdown of localisms of all
sorts, and the emergence of new strategies and dis-
courses about governance. And from this, one can iden-
tify the pace of institutional change, the causal
dynamics underlying the complex cluster of interlocked
and tied processes that constitute modernity. Or at the
least, one can anticipate that such an analysis--other-
wise impossible--is within reach.
Or consider a related problem: how should we case
historical event sequences; that is, how should we
induce periods? Newly available textual corpora span-
ning long periods of time provide a powerful setting for
identifying turning points. As with the previous discus-
sion, American historians agree that at some time
2 Big Data & Society
American social and political discourse over the course
of the more than two centuries from 1790 to the present
changed. They also agree about the nature of this chan-
ge--that one can with confidence distinguish modern
discourse from earlier forms. Yet when this change hap-
pened and how we can best identify it are matters of
significant debate. The canonical explanations center
on 1865, 1877, 1896, and 1913, but just about any
year has a proponent! This debate necessarily impli-
cates scholarly strategies for casing history, that is, stra-
tegies for identifying partitions in the necessarily
uninterrupted flow of the past sufficient to meaningfully
induce discrete temporal clusters such as `the gilded
age'', ``the progressive period'', ``the age of the fron-
tier'', and so on. The partitions that one selects
depend, of course, on the standpoint from which one

starts. The history of America as a country of immi-
grants induces a different partition from the history of
America as a loose confederacy of states. Given this,
the challenge is generating a meaningful partition
between modern and pre-modern social and political
discourse where the contents of that discourse are rhet-
orical devices for periodization! To do this, one needs
to identify a form that is continuous, and of continuous
significance. Enter Big Data.
Drawing from the archive of Presidential SoU
addresses, Rule et al. (2015) show that the annual
SoU addresses of Presidents provides, despite changes
in mode of delivery, one such form, and thus provides
an Archimedean point from which they can view the
content and structure of American social and political
discourse unfolding over time. Using new strategies for
analyzing historical texts in which terms, concepts, lan-
guage use and words' meanings change over time, Rule
et al. show that modern social and political discourse
over the nature of governance emerges as a distinct
object after 1917, though elements of such discourse
are identifiable earlier. This provides new insights into
our understanding of American history and transforms
in its wake our understanding of what modern and pre-
modern discourse looks like and, equally critically, the
elements of continuity that link them. Along the way,
they demonstrate a new strategy for identifying mean-
ingful categories in textual corpora that span long per-
iods of time. Specifically, their approach is able to
account for the fluidity of discursive categories over
time, and to analyze their continuity by identifying
the conversational stream as the object of interest.
That it gives rise to visualizations that allow for the
identification of lexical change over the longue duree
(as in Figure 1) is simply an additional benefit.
A whole class of new problems that could not be
precisely articulated may be accessible with Big Data.
Using a new data structure that precisely geo-references
season ticket holders of the New York Philharmonic
with respect to seat location (!) and residence,
Accominetti and Khan (2015), for example, can show
how the NYC elite used patronage of cultural institu-
tions to recognize themselves, and how this capacity for
joint recognition led to a subsequent reorganization of
residential patterns in the City during the Gilded Age.
One insight here is that the elite class came to see itself
through joint observation across multiple settings,
neighborhoods, concerts, and so on, while at the same
time creating avenues for non-elites to circulate on the
borders of the elite sub-world.
Likewise, Hoffman et al. (2015), using data from the
Atlantic slave trade archive, bolstered with detailed
occupational data gleaned from newly available geo-
referenced street directories for Liverpool, are able to
show why the Liverpool slave trade ownership network,
was able to ride out failure caused by privateering and
``defeat'' London and Bristol for control of the Triangle
Trade after 1750. In the same vein, Muller and his col-
leagues are currently digitizing prison incarceration data
for Lawrence Mass, during the famed Bread and Roses
strike, which, coupled with other administrative (census,
mortality, hospital) data, will make it possible to model
the diffusion of resistance in one of the canonical events
in US Labor history (2015). All of these studies were
theoretically possible before ``Big Data'', but none
could be accomplished within the lifetime of a single
scholar. The promise of such studies is both their con-
tribution to the specific history with which they engage
and the identification of mechanisms that may be trans-
posable across context. Using Big Data to identify trans-
posable mechanisms is, I believe, central. Otherwise, we
are left with mere description, a useful project, but not a
particularly useful sociological project.
These few examples barely touch the surface of what
the Big Data revolution is making possible in historical
studies. Whole arenas of work reliant on administrative
data structures (like the census); institutional records
(for example, state-level records on de-institutionaliza-
tion of mental patients in the 1970­1985 period); data
that link standard social science instruments with large-
scale historical archives (like the GSS with the mortality
schedules for the US, and so on) are not described
herein. In so far as they share the characteristics of
the projects described above: oriented towards answer-
ing causally important questions through the identifica-
tion of transposable mechanisms, as versus writing
narrative sentences, focused on identifying the pace
and structure of change arising from key institutional
locales known to undergird the large historical
processes of interest, these Big Data structures can
revolutionize historical social science. In so far as
they capture merely epiphenomenal materials arising
from non-central institutional locales, Big Data seems
less promising. After all, what goes in comes out.
