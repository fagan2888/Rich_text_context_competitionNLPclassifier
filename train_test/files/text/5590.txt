Introduction
The analysis of spatial patterns uses one of the three funda-
mental forms of spatial data: points, lines, or areas. In the
social sciences, the most common forms of spatial analysis
are conducted on points and areas, with the latter accounting
for the majority of such studies: understanding spatial pat-
terns across census units, neighborhoods, counties, prov-
inces/states, or countries, for example. However, the analysis
of spatial point patterns is of interest to a number of disci-
plines including criminology (Ratcliffe, 2005), ecology
(Perry et al., 2006), and epidemiology (Elliott et al., 2000).
One of the most commonly asked questions in the analy-
sis of spatial point patterns is whether or not the spatial pat-
tern follows one of the theoretical distributions: uniform,
random, or clustered. Although this may be of some interest,
it has been long known that human activities and their condi-
tions are clustered in space (Gatrell et al., 1996). As such, a
spatial point pattern test that can identify differences in the
forms of clustering would be particularly instructive: is a
phenomenon more clustered than expected, for example?
Researchers may be interested in knowing how similar two
crime types are with regard to their spatial pattern or two
disease types. Identifying differences in crime and disease
type spatial patterns could help researchers identify unique
risk factors that may be addressed. Alternatively, if clusters
of both can be identified, a common intervention may be
possible.
When analyzing spatial (point) patterns, there are two
forms of analysis: global and local. Global spatial analyses
investigate the spatial pattern and provide an overall statistic
for the entire study area; local spatial analyses investigate the
same spatial pattern, but provide statistics for all areal units
involved such that the output of the analyses can be mapped.
Moreover, it is now well-understood that global spatial anal-
yses can mask local spatial patterns (Anselin, 1995; Getis

pattern test: The test, its applications, and
the future

Abstract
The analysis of spatial point patterns is a critical component of the geographic information analysis literature. Most of the
tests for these data are concerned with random, uniform, and clustered patterns. However, knowing whether a spatial point
pattern is similar to these theoretical data-generating processes is not always instructive: most human activity is clustered,
so finding that some component of human activity is clustered is not really new information. In this article, a recently
developed spatial point pattern test is discussed that compares the similarity of two different data sets. This comparison can
be comparisons of different phenomena (different types of crime or public health issues) or the same phenomenon over time,
for example. The discussion revolves around the test itself, its varied applications, and the future developments expected for
this spatial point pattern test.

and Ord, 1992, 1996; Ord and Getis, 1995), and conse-
quently, both forms of analysis should be considered if data
are available.
In this article, a relatively recent spatial point pattern test
is discussed. This spatial point pattern test identifies the simi-
larity of two spatial point patterns. As such, it is not con-
cerned with the theoretical distributions of uniform, random,
and clustered. The test, its applications, and directions for
future research are all covered. This test is area-based (e.g.
census tracts and neighborhoods), as opposed to point-based1
(measured actual and expected distances between points),
nonparametric, and provides both global and local output.
Because this spatial point pattern test is nonparametric, it
does not rely on any underlying data-generating process or
distribution, or require that particular assumptions be met.
These assumptions usually involve particular statistical dis-
tributions for the data, but with nonparametric tests, no such
assumptions are required. In the case of this spatial point pat-
tern test, it is a permutation test that generates its own distri-
bution for the purposes of statistical inference.
All that is required are two spatial point pattern files and
an area-based file; the graphical user interface that performs
the test, discussed below, can generate a grid of any size to
act as the area-based file for analysis. The global output is an
index of similarity, S-Index, and the local output is an
indicator of spatial similarity for each areal unit in the analy-
sis that can be mapped; this latter output, and its interpreta-
tion, is shown in an example below.
Spatial point pattern test
The spatial point pattern test developed by Andresen (2009)
addresses the issue of comparing the similarity of two point
patterns without being concerned about the statistical con-
cepts of randomness, uniformity, and clustering. This test is
conceptually simple, but computationally intense. With the
development of a graphical user interface (see Figure 1), the
application of this test is straightforward. For the purpose of
understanding the nature of the test itself, an illustration is
provided here. There are a number of steps necessary to
undertake the spatial point pattern test that are outlined below
and illustrated in Figure 2--the steps are not discussed spe-
cifically in terms of Figure 2, rather this figure is included to
aid in the understanding of the testing process through a vis-
ualization of the discussion.
The first step for the test is to identify the necessary data for
analysis. Although a somewhat manifest statement, there are
some data conditions necessary to conduct the test. At this
time, although future developments are discussed further
below, two geo-referenced point-based data sets for

comparison are necessary. The geo-referencing is necessary
because each point must be assigned to an individual areal unit
of analysis. The areal unit data may take any number of differ-
ent forms: a set of grids placed over the study area, neighbor-
hood boundaries, census tracts, or some other form of census
boundary areas (census block groups, dissemination areas,
output areas, etc.). Although all of the examples just listed
would have complete coverage over the study area, this is not
necessary for the test. Rather, all of the geo-referenced point
data need to be assigned to an area; this becomes particularly
important for some research questions, described in detail
below. Briefly, street segments have been used in applications
of this spatial point pattern test; street segments are polyline
files that do not have complete coverage over a study area, by
definition of the data. During the geocoding process, points
are often placed on the appropriate side of the street based on
the address locator such that the points are not directly on
the polyline. This can be overcome through the use of small-
area buffers around each street segment to place each geo-
referenced point within, but there will still be empty spaces
between the buffers.
Once all of the necessary data are collected, the first deci-
sion that needs to be made is which geo-referenced point
data set shall be deemed the base data set and the test data
set; the base data are considered the baseline. From the per-
spective of undertaking the test, this choice may be of little
consequence, but there may be "natural" choices. For exam-
ple, if the spatial point patterns of a phenomenon are being
compared over time, 2014 and 2015, a natural choice is to
have the 2014 data as the base data set and the 2015 data as
the test data set. In this situation, the implicit question is
whether the 2015 data have a similar spatial pattern to the
2014 data: has something changed over the year?
The base data set is manipulated the least during the test.
Each geo-referenced point is assigned to an areal unit, the
number of points within each areal unit is aggregated, and
the percentage of the points within each areal unit is calcu-
lated. This allows for the comparison of data sets with differ-
ent numbers of points. This set of percentages will then be
used to compare to the test data set that undergoes a Monte
Carlo simulation process.
Similar to the base data set, the geo-referenced points
within the test data set are assigned to an areal unit. At this
stage, however, the process for the two data sets changes.
Rather than calculating a single percentage for each areal
unit, a Monte Carlo simulation is performed to create a con-
fidence interval for each areal unit. A random sample (with
replacement) of the test data set is undertaken, selecting 85%
of the entire test data set--this value is based on Ratcliffe
(2004), but can be modified in the graphical user interface.
The percentages of points falling within each areal unit of
this randomly sampled data set are then calculated and
stored. This process is repeated a number of times in order to
calculate a confidence interval for subsequent statistical test-
ing (200 is used for convenient cut-offs to generate a 95%
confidence interval).2 All of these percentages within each
areal unit can then be ranked, removing the top and bottom
2.5% of percentages to create a 95% nonparametric confi-
dence interval. The percentage for the base and the upper­
lower estimates for the test data are then compared. If the
percentage of points for an areal unit in the base data set is
within the corresponding confidence interval for the test data
set, this areal unit is considered similar. This is repeated for
each of the individual areal units of analysis.

This information can then be applied to calculate a global
Index of Similarity, S, that ranges from 0 (no similarity) to 1
(perfect similarity). This Index is calculated as follows
S
s
n
i
i
n
= =

1
(1)
where n is the number of areas, s
i
is equal to 1 if the spatial
pattern of two data sets is considered similar for areal unit i,
and 0 otherwise. This Index of Similarity, then, represents
the proportion of areal units that exhibit similar spatial pat-
terns. Finally, the output from the spatial point pattern test
can also be mapped such that the researcher can visualize
where the two geo-referenced point-based data sets are (dis)
similar. The graphical user interface, developed by Nick
Malleson at the University of Leeds, is freely available (writ-
ten in Java to be platform independent): https://github.com/
nickmalleson/spatialtest.
The last decision to be made is whether the two spatial
point patterns are to be considered similar, or not. This is
done using the global S-Index value. Although there is no
statistical method of identifying a threshold for similarity, a
rule of thumb has been used in the application of this test.
There are rules of thumb for the interpretation of many statis-
tics: at what point does R2 indicate an acceptable level for
goodness-of-fit? The rule of thumb used in the current con-
text relates to the literature that considers multicollinearity in
a multiple regression context and bivariate correlations. With
regard to the multiple regression context, the variance infla-
tion factor is often used to measure the degree of multicol-
linearity. O'Brien (2007) states that variance inflation factors
ranging from 5 to 10 (and greater, of course) may be cause
for concern. In a bivariate correlation context (most similar
to the application of this spatial point pattern test), this cor-
responds to correlation coefficients ranging from 0.80 to
0.90--Cohen (1988) considers lower levels of correlation to
be considered "strong," but these higher values are consid-
ered to be more conservative. Consequently, the research
implementing this test most often uses 0.80 as a threshold for
similarity. However, it should be noted that this threshold is
not, and should not be, considered in a binary context such as
statistical significance. As the S-Index value approaches
0.80, the two spatial point patterns should be considered
approaching similarity.
The general underlying principle for this spatial point
pattern test is that the spatial pattern of the base data set is
given (the percentages for the individual areal units are
just calculated), but the spatial pattern for the test data set
is one possible realization of the actual spatial point pat-
tern. The randomization process maintains the underlying
spatial pattern (data-generating process) of the test data set
while creating sampling variation allowing for nonpara-
metric statistical inference through the calculation of con-
fidence intervals.
Applications of the spatial point pattern
test
Previous applications of the spatial point pattern
test
The first application of the spatial point pattern test is in the
paper that initially develops the test (Andresen, 2009). In this
first application, Andresen (2009) shows that the spatial
point patterns of theft of vehicle, burglary (commercial and
residential), and an aggregate of violent crime all appear to
have similar spatial patterns. However, the analysis shows,
using both census tracts and dissemination areas (the
Canadian equivalent to the census block group in the United
States), that their similarities are actually quite low: S-Index
values ranging from 0.08 to 0.20. Based on the criteria for
similarity identified using the spatial point pattern test dis-
cussed above, S0.80, none of these crime spatial patterns
can be considered similar. Consequently, any analysis of this
aggregated spatial pattern may be of little use because it does
not represent any particular crime that could be targeted for
prevention or reduction. In fact, it is possible that one could
aggregate a number of clustered crime types into a spatial
pattern that appears to be random. Because of this, Andresen
(2009) argues that the aggregation of different crime types is
problematic if one is implicitly or explicitly concerned with
understanding spatial patterns of crime.
In an investigation of crime concentrations and the impor-
tance of considering spatial scale when trying to understand
spatial crime patterns, Andresen and Malleson (2011) con-
sider the stability of spatial crime patterns through an applica-
tion of the spatial point pattern test over time: same crime
type, but investigating changes in its spatial patterns over
years. Andresen and Malleson (2011) analyzed the crime
types of assault, burglary, robbery, sexual assault, theft, theft
of vehicle, and theft from vehicle considering census tracts,
dissemination areas, and street segments. Overall, they found
that when considering census tracts and dissemination areas,
the spatial crime patterns were only relatively stable over
time for the rare events of robbery and sexual assault. Only
when the authors analyzed the stability of spatial crime pat-
terns at the street segment level did stability/similarity over
time emerge. However, this result was driven by the large per-
centage of street segments that did not have any crime; the
S-Index values were all below 0.52 after this was controlled
for in a sensitivity analysis. The results and sensitivity analy-
sis undertaken by Andresen and Malleson (2011) show a par-
ticularmanifestationofthemodifiablearealunitproblem--see
Fotheringham and Wong (1991) and Openshaw (1984b). The
modifiable areal unit problem refers to statistical results
changing when the areal units change. There are two forms of
the modifiable areal unit problem: scale and zoning. The scale
problem is described above, indicating a change in the results
when the scale of the analysis is changed. The zoning prob-
lem occurs when smaller units are organized in a different
Andresen 5
way, but at the same spatial scale--shifting an existing set of
neighborhoods, for example. This is a problem because (very)
different statistical results can emerge when changing areal
units. In fact, Fotheringham and Wong (1991) were able to
generate any result through the modification of areal units.
This proves to be an important factor with this spatial point
pattern test and is discussed further, below.
In an extension of the original work done by Andresen
(2009), Andresen and Linning (2012) used the spatial point
pattern test to investigate the similarity of spatial patterns of
different crime types. The primary research question was
whether it was appropriate to aggregate different crime types
to their aggregate forms when the research is concerned with
spatial patterns of crime: property crime and violent crime,
for example. Andresen and Linning (2012) also considered
three different spatial units of analysis (census tracts, dis-
semination areas, and street segments), but included crime
data from Ottawa (commercial burglary, residential burglary,
commercial robbery, individual robbery, other robbery, theft
of vehicle, and a number of different aggregations) and
Vancouver (the same crime types as Andresen and Malleson,
2011). Overall, they found that spatial crime patterns were
not similar across all crime types for census tracts and dis-
semination areas--different forms of robbery in Ottawa were
the exception. Only when street segments were used as the
areal unit of analysis did the S-Index value reach the thresh-
old of 0.80; however, this only occurred in Ottawa (all crime
types) and Vancouver (robbery and sexual assault). Their
conclusion was clear: only in a situation when crime is
incredibly concentrated (Ottawa's central business district) is
it appropriate to aggregate different crime types together.
Andresen and Malleson (2013b) explicitly investigate the
impact of the modifiable areal unit problem using the spatial
point pattern test using data from Vancouver, Canada, and
Leeds, England. Specifically, Andresen and Malleson
(2013b) consider the change in the spatial patterns of crime
over time using two different areal units of analysis in each
city. They then compare the results for the different spatial
scales to investigate the percentage of the smaller areal units
within the larger areal units that exhibit the same change.
Generally speaking, these authors find that approximately
one-half of the smaller areal units exhibit the same spatial
change as the larger areal units that the smaller areal units
fall within. Clearly, any results found for larger areal units
are being driven by one-half of the smaller areal units. This
shows the relationship between the modifiable areal unit
problem and the ecological fallacy in this context--the eco-
logical fallacy is committed when the researcher makes
inference at a finer scale of resolution than is being analyzed,
making inferences regarding individuals when neighbor-
hoods are the unit of analysis, for example. Moreover,
because of the nature of statistical testing, Andresen and
Malleson (2013b) found that in some cases, none of the
smaller areal units of analysis exhibited the same spatial
change as the larger areal units. This was investigated in
detail, and it was found that only when the data were aggre-
gated to the larger areal units was (marginal) statistical sig-
nificance obtained in the results. As such, care must be taken
when making statistical inferences with spatial data.
In another consideration of (in)appropriate aggregation of
crime data, Andresen and Malleson (2013a) investigated the
similarity of spatial crime patterns across the different sea-
sons of the year. Their research question was concerned with
the value of yearly counts of crime, and corresponding rates,
when considering any explanation of the respective patterns.
If the spatial patterns of crime changed from season to sea-
son, are the spatial patterns of a yearly aggregate meaning-
ful? Considering both census tracts and dissemination areas,
Andresen and Malleson (2013a) found that the spatial pat-
terns of crime were rather dissimilar for seven of the eight
crime types investigated. Only robbery and sexual assault
had S-Index values that exceeded the threshold of 0.80, and
only for dissemination areas. However, it should be noted
that these two crime types have low counts and there are
many dissemination areas, so the zero-value issue emerges
here as well--Andresen and Malleson (2013a) did not under-
take sensitivity analyses in this instance. Regardless, this
shows that spatial patterns of crime change throughout the
year and must be considered, as stated by the authors, when
considering crime prevention initiatives.
The next analysis of spatial point pattern similarity was
undertaken by Andresen and Malleson (2014) in an analysis
of crime displacement from a police foot patrol initiative.
Most investigations of crime displacement (the movement of
criminal activity because of a crime prevention initiative,
such as a police foot patrol) have a treatment area and a
catchment area that immediately surrounds the treatment
area; this is done because it is assumed that crime may be
displaced and move around the corner (Weisburd et al.,
2006).Although there are still many questions to be answered
regarding this process, research in this sub-field of crime
prevention finds evidence for a diffusion of benefits: crimi-
nal activity decreases in both the treatment area and the
catchment area (Guerette and Bowers, 2009; Johnson et al.,
2014; Telep et al., 2014; Weisburd et al., 2006).
Andresen and Malleson (2014) ask the following ques-
tion: in the presence of a diffusion of crime prevention ben-
efits, does the spatial pattern of criminal activity change, or
does criminal activity go down in the same way in all places?
For example, suppose the levels of crime were the same in
the treatment area with a crime prevention initiative and the
catchment area without that crime prevention initiative:
crime goes down everywhere to the same degree. However,
crime could go down everywhere but at different rates in dif-
ferent places. Such a situation could be illustrated with a bal-
loon: crime goes down everywhere such that the balloon now
has less air in it, but it goes down more in the treatment area
with the crime prevention initiative. This can be visualized
by pushing down in the center of a deflated balloon. Crime
has gone down everywhere, but the spatial pattern has
6 Methodological Innovations
changed such that there is now relatively more crime in the
surrounding area. This situation may occur when offenders
do move around the corner from the crime prevention initia-
tive, but are less active there than before.
In their analyses, Andresen and Malleson (2014) found
moderate support for a change in the spatial pattern of crime
(in the presence of criminal activity decreasing in both the
treatment area and the surrounding catchment area), indicat-
ing that the distribution of criminal activity shifts toward the
surrounding area although that criminal activity decreases
everywhere. This has important implications for further crime
prevention initiatives because it shows a rational response
from offenders: offenders decrease criminal activity, but shift
their remaining criminal activity away from where the police
are known to be.
Although they consider multiple methodologies to address
their research question, Tompson et al. (2015) investigate the
similarity of open-source crime data in the United Kingdom
to actual police-recorded crime data. The issue is that in order
to make criminal event data available to the public while
simultaneously considering privacy and confidentiality, the
developers of the open-source data undertake a process of
geomasking that adds "noise" to the data such that actual
locations of criminal events cannot be known. Tompson et al.
(2015) were concerned whether this geomasking changed the
underlying (and true) spatial crime patterns. Overall, these
authors found that the similarity of these two data sources was
not particularly high when considering small areas of analysis
such as postal codes and output areas. However, when consid-
ering larger geographic areas, Tompson et al. (2015) found a
high degree of similarity between the two different data
sources for most crime types (lower layer super output areas
and middle layer super output areas).
In another consideration of temporal aggregation,
Andresen and Malleson (2015) investigated the similarity of
spatial crime patterns for different days of the week for
assault, burglary, robbery, sexual assault, theft, theft of vehi-
cle, and theft from vehicle considering census tracts and dis-
semination areas. Similar to the seasonality research of
Andresen and Malleson (2013a), this research found that the
spatial patterns of crime changed significantly for different
days of the week; the only exceptions were robbery and sex-
ual assault with disseminations areas.
Extending the work of Andresen and Linning (2012), Melo
et al. (2015) investigated the appropriateness of aggregating
crime types in Campinas, Brazil. In their analysis, Melo et al.
(2015) not only considered a number of spatial scales (pon-
deration areas, census tracts, and street segments) but consid-
ered the impact of zero-values beyond what has been discussed
above. Melo et al. (2015) undertook a sensitivity analysis that
only considered non-zero street segments to test the similarity
of spatial point patterns in two ways; first, they considered a
street segment non-zero if it had any criminal event, similar to
the sensitivity analyses discussed above, and, second, they
considered a street segment non-zero if it had any crime that
related to the two crime types being tested. Melo et al. (2015)
found that the former definition of a non-zero street segment
still resulted in a high degree of similarity in the spatial point
patterns of most crime type comparisons. However, with the
latter, and arguably more appropriate, definition of a non-zero
street segment, very few of the comparisons achieved or
approached the threshold S-Index value of 0.80. This result is
particularly important because of the great detail in the crime
types analyzed, indicating that it is almost never appropriate to
aggregate crime types if one is concerned with spatial crime
patterns.
In an extension of Andresen and Malleson (2013a),
Linning (2015) investigated the spatial patterns of seasonal-
ity in Vancouver and Ottawa considering the micro-spatial
unit of analysis, the street segment. Despite the presence of
temporal seasonal patterns, Linning (2015) found no evi-
dence for changing spatial patterns of crime in either city.
This result shows the importance of the areal unit of analysis
and the modifiable areal unit problem.
And most recently in the context of crime, Pereira et al. (in
press) investigated the spatial patterns of homicide in Recife,
Brazil. There has been a significant drop in homicides in
Recife in recent years, and Pereira et al. (in press) found that
these homicides were highly concentrated. Moreover, Pereira
et al. (in press) found a high degree of spatial similarity from
year to year while the homicide rate dropped almost 50%
because so much of the city does not have any homicides.
Even when considering non-zero areal units of analysis (cen-
sus tracts and street segments), there was a moderately high
degree of spatial similarity. Specifically, the use of the spatial
point pattern test in conjunction with other analyses indicates
that homicides simply stopped occurring in particular places
in Recife.
At this time, Andresen (2010) is the only application of
this spatial point pattern test that is outside of a criminological
context--this potential is discussed further below. In this arti-
cle, Andresen (2010) investigates the changing spatial pat-
terns of interprovincial and international trade after the North
American Free Trade Agreement entered into force in 1994.
International trade theory predicts that when barriers to trade,
such as tariffs, are removed, spatial patterns of interprovincial
and international trade may change. Andresen's (2010) data,
however, are not points but values assigned to Canadian prov-
inces and US states. In an effort to apply the spatial point
pattern test to these data, Andresen (2010) uses the concept of
a quasi-point: if British Columbia exports CAD5
million of
goods to Texas, place 5 points within Texas for an analysis
of changing trading patterns for British Columbia. With
provinces and states being the units of analysis, as long as
no inference is made at larger cartographic scales (smaller
areas), issues regarding the ecological fallacy will not emerge
(Openshaw, 1984a). In any event, the quasi-point proved to
be instructive for the use of the spatial point pattern test. As
expected, Andresen (2010) found that the spatial patterns of
interprovincial and international trade changed substantially
Andresen 7
after the North American Free Trade Agreement entered into
force. Moreover, the mapped output from the spatial point
pattern test was able to show that the spatial pattern of trade
shifted toward the United States, away from Canadian prov-
inces, after the removal of trade barriers.
An example of the test and its output
Although instructive and containing interesting information
for the spatial analysis of crime, the above discussions are
limited without a complete presentation of the results.
However, a full detailed account of all of these analyses is far
beyond the scope of this article. As such, a detailed account
of the seasonality study undertaken by Andresen and
Malleson (2013a) is discussed here, with a map of the output
from the spatial point pattern test.
As stated above,Andresen and Malleson (2013a) found that
spatial crime patterns were not similar from season to season,
an indication that aggregating criminal events to a yearly
aggregate may be problematic. As shown by Linning (2015),
this may not be the case at the micro-spatial unit of analysis, but
this result may have important implications for understanding
spatial crime patterns at more spatially aggregated levels.
Considering all crime types, Andresen and Malleson
(2013a) found S-Index values that ranged from 0.14 to 0.50
for census tracts and dissemination areas. This is clearly not
even close to the threshold value of 0.80, indicating a lack of
spatial similarity. Perhaps more interesting, however, is the
local spatial output from the spatial point pattern test. Figure
3a shows Vancouver with some points of interest, and Figure
3b shows the output from the test comparing the yearly
aggregate to summer. In summer, the spatial pattern of crime
shifts more toward the places where people spend their rec-
reational time: Kitsilano Beach out toward the University of
British Columbia (UBC), Stanley Park, downtown, Queen
Elizabeth Park, and the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE).
These locations attract residents and tourists alike during the
summer months, shifting the concentrations of targets for a
number of different crime types. This is exactly what would
be expected according to theories of environmental criminol-
ogy (Andresen, 2014), showing the utility of visualizing the
output of the spatial point pattern test.
Potential applications of the spatial point pattern
test
The discussions above have shown the utility of this spatial
point pattern test in the context of understanding the spatial
patterns of crime, and one application within the interna-
tional trade literature. However, the potential applications of
this spatial point pattern test are in any context when the
similarity between two spatial point patterns is of interest. In
particular, this test is useful when the researcher is not par-
ticularly concerned whether the spatial pattern of their data is
considered uniform, random, or clustered.
This is similar to the issue of how to calculate a crime rate
and choose the appropriate denominator (Andresen, 2011). If
one is interested in the spatial patterning of traffic collisions,
the base consideration is not the theoretical distribution of a
clustered phenomenon, but the underlying distribution of
traffic overall: is the clustering of traffic collisions different
than the overall clustering of traffic? If so, where? This has a
number of applications within the social science, but also the
health sciences, environmental studies, and urban planning.
Directions and considerations for the
future
Thus far, the research on this spatial point pattern test has
generated one methodological issue that must always be con-
sidered, a number of extensions to the spatial point pattern
test and its software, and some theoretical implications for
testing. Each is discussed in turn.
The methodological issue relates to the modifiable areal
unit problem (Fotheringham and Wong, 1991; Openshaw,
1984b) and non-zero street segments. In the context of street
segments, many social phenomena will have some degree of
clustering. In Vancouver, there are just over 10,000 street seg-
ments that an analysis must consider. If the phenomenon
under study is a relatively rare event, concentrations will nec-
essarily appear in global statistics: a crime type that has 1000
events in a particular year will have a minimum level of con-
centration at 10% (1000 events divided by 10,000 street seg-
ments). In this situation, even if all of these criminal events
move to a completely different set of locations within the city,
the S-Index value will be 0.80, indicating spatial similarity.
Although technically true, because 80% of the city has the
same levels of criminal events (zero), this is problematic for
understanding the spatial crime patterns in a city, especially if
one wishes to prevent those criminal events.
As such, when considering the similarity of two spatial
point patterns, one must be aware of this potential when ana-
lyzing data using a large number of small areal units of anal-
ysis. This is a particular form of the modifiable areal unit
problem when the change in the S-Index with a change in the
areal units of analysis will most often be known: the greater
the number of areal units in the study area and the fewer the
number of events under analysis, the more similar two spa-
tial point patterns will appear to be. Consequently, this is not
a property of the spatial point pattern test, but a consequence
of assigning a relatively small number of events to a large
number of places.
The first extension to the spatial point pattern test relates
to the concept of the quasi-point introduced by Andresen
(2010) in the context of international and interprovincial
trade pattern changes. It is a relatively simple task to have the
program that runs the spatial point pattern test to create
quasi-points if the data are organized appropriately. For
instance, if the data were organized such that areal unit of
analysis i had a count of n events (e.g. events is a general
8 Methodological Innovations
term here that could refer to millions of dollars of interna-
tional trade), the program could generate an analysis data set
that would then include n observations for areal unit i.
Consequently, rather than having i observations each having
a count of events, the analysis data set would have i×n
observations each representing a single event. These could
be quasi-points, as defined by the researcher in some
meaningful way for the analysis. Alternatively, such data
could represent actual points in a manner that the researcher
does not have access to the original data: a count of events
within a neighborhood, for example. It is not uncommon for
criminal event data to be available as counts within some
areal unit (neighborhoods, police beats, census tracts, etc.) as
a means of maintaining confidentiality for the victims.

Second, the graphical user interface could be further
developed to describe the differences and similarities
between the two point patterns analyzed. For example, some
brief descriptive statistics could be provided. The graphical
user interface calculates the S-Index, so the user could manu-
ally calculate the non-similarity index: 1
-
S. However, it
may be of particular interest to the researcher to know the
percentages when base
>
test and test
>
base. Moreover, if
layers of census data could be added, the different outputs
(insignificant change, base
>
test, test
>
base) could be auto-
matically compared to those census data. Of course, these are
all subsequent analyses that could be undertaken within other
GIS software, but this availability will make the current
graphical user interface more functional for the user.
Third, in case the standard distributions of uniform or ran-
dom are of interest to the researcher, the graphical user inter-
face could generate a random or uniform set of points within
the study area (with an option for how many points). These
points could then be used as the base data set to investigate
how similar the spatial pattern of interest is to a random or
uniform spatial pattern.
Fourth, further investigations into the threshold values of
the S-Index need to be undertaken. Specifically, the S-Index
could be calculated with comparisons to a random distribu-
tion, for example, to generate a distribution of the S-Index
values that could be used for identifying the threshold for
similarity. Such a method would be preferable to the ad hoc,
though instructive, method discussed above.
And fifth, a natural extension of the spatial point pattern
test is to move beyond "bivariate" comparisons. At this time,
the program for the spatial point pattern test is set up to com-
pare two spatial point patterns. However, there is no reason
why this test cannot be expanded into a multivariate context.
In such a testing situation, one could find the degree of simi-
larity across three or more spatial point patterns. Figure 4
shows four different possibilities for such a multivariate spa-
tial point pattern test. The dashed horizontal line represents
the base percentage of points for the test, and the vertical
lines represent the confidence intervals for the various test
data sets: comparing the spatial pattern of crime in 2000
(base) versus a number of subsequent years (test data sets).
In these scenarios, the base percentage is always within the
confidence intervals (a), initially within the confidence inter-
vals but then the confidence intervals fall to zero represent-
ing the crime drop (b), sporadically similar for the base and
subsequent test data sets (c), and never similar over time (d).
Such a comparison would be particularly instructive for
the crime and place literature that has been concerned with
the stability of crime concentrations over time (Weisburd
et al., 2012). Although pairs of years over time can be com-
pared to investigate the stability (Andresen and Malleson,
2011), knowing whether places are consistently stable over
time would be particularly instructive for the crime and place
literature. As such, in a multivariate spatial context, this spa-
tial point pattern test could investigate the stability of spatial
crime patterns of 12­16
years, as investigated in the crime
Figure 4. Multivariate spatial point pattern test.
10 Methodological Innovations
and place literature. Such an extension to the spatial point
pattern test could prove to be important. It is possible, for
example, that a spatial pattern may appear to be stable over
time when undertaking pair-wise comparisons but be quite
different when considering the entire study period. Such a
situation could emerge when year-to-year patterns are simi-
lar but similar in different places in each pair-wise compari-
son. Only when considering the entire study period within a
single test could spatial stability be truly confirmed or denied.
Finally, the development of different testing methodolo-
gies has implications for testing theories. For example, tests
of theories within environmental criminology (place-based
theories) often consider random and uniform distributions as
the baseline. Are criminal events clustered, relative to a ran-
dom distribution? However, we know that human activities,
both criminal and non-criminal, are clustered in space. As
such, testing to see whether a specific human activity is clus-
tered is essentially tautological.Amore sensible baseline dis-
tribution for the clustering of crime would be a representation
of the road network. Road networks tend to have greater den-
sity in the central business district than the suburbs, so ran-
domly placed points on a road network will appear clustered.
A point-based representation of the street segments in a road
network could be used as the base data set with crime data as
the test data set to investigate any greater concentrations of
crime in particular areas. This information could then be
used when conducting theoretical testing, rather than solely
relying upon census data.
Conclusion
This article has reviewed the development, applications, and
future for a relatively recent spatial statistical test used in the
social sciences. This is a spatial point pattern test that is non-
parametric and finds the degree of similarity between two
spatial point data sets. The output from this test is a global
statistic of similarity, the S-Index, and local output that can
be mapped. The current applications for this test are domi-
nantly criminological, but the potential for its use outside of
spatial criminology should be quite apparent from the dis-
cussions above.
Although this spatial point pattern test is still in its infancy,
its utility beyond identifying uniform, random, and clustered
spatial point patterns has been shown here. Most human,
social, and environmental processes are not random or uni-
form across space. Consequently, a test that allows for com-
parisons of spatial point patterns without a concern for these
theoretical distributions is instructive for the social and envi-
ronmental sciences.
There is still a lot of work to be done to make this spatial
point pattern test more practical for uses on other contexts,
but these are programming tasks with no need for further
development of the test itself. As with the current graphical
user interface (https://github.com/nickmalleson/spatialtest),
future developments of the test will continue to remain freely
available and open source. In addition to the flexibility
enhancements discussed above, it is hoped that this new spa-
tial point pattern test will soon be available as a library within
the R Project for Statistical Computing (http://www.r-pro-
ject.org/).

Monte Carlo experiments (Hope, 1968) have found that good
results are achieved with as few as 50 and 20 repeated samples,
respectively.
