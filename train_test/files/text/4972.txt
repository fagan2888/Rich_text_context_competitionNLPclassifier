Introduction
Abetter understanding of the motivation to engage in health
behaviors is essential. Up to now the focus has mainly been
on the quantitative dimension of motivation (Silva et al.,
2008). Deci and Ryan with the self-determination theory
(SDT) emphasize the importance of motivation quality
(Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan and Deci, 2000). In fact, this
theory proposes that the regulation of a behavior may take
many forms that correspond to different behavioral regula-
tory styles according to motivation differing by their self-
determination level, and which can be differentiated along
a continuum. Moreover, according to the SDT, different
self-determined regulatory styles are associated with vari-
ous consequences. In fact, self-determined forms of moti-
vation are associated with positive consequences and least
self-determined forms of motivation with more negative
consequences. Another key postulate from the SDT
addresses the processes that facilitate internalization of
non-self-determined regulatory styles toward more self-
determined regulatory styles (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan
and Deci, 2000) if supportive conditions are in place, that
is, a context that fosters satisfaction of three basic psycho-
logical needs which are autonomy, competence, and relat-
edness. In regard to the regulation of eating behaviors,
previous studies showed that behaviors regulated by self-
determined motivation promote adoption of healthy eating
behaviors and long-term maintenance of healthy eating
habits (Pelletier et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2002) and
could also be a protective factor against social pressures
unfavorable to healthy eating behaviors (Mask and
Blanchard, 2011; Pelletier et al., 2004).
Evidence suggests that a person will be more likely to
develop and maintain more self-determined motivation in a
context that is autonomy-supportive (Deci et al., 1994;

Abstract
Our objective was to determine gender differences in the impact of a nutritional intervention based on the self-
determination theory and promoting the Mediterranean diet on changes in eating-related self-determined motivation
and adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Changes in eating-related self-determined motivation were larger in men
than in women in response to the intervention and at follow-up, but the magnitude of change decreased with time
in both genders. Changes in eating-related self-determined motivation were positively associated with changes in the
Mediterranean diet adherence in response to the intervention and at follow-up in men only, suggesting that the nutritional
program seems to fit better men than women.

Intervention Study

Williams et al., 2006). Autonomy support refers to eliciting
and acknowledging a person's perspectives and values, sup-
porting initiatives, offering options, and providing relevant
information while minimizing persuasion and control
(Resnicow and McMaster, 2012). Development of autonomy-
supportive nutritional approaches aimed to promote self-
determined motivation seems promising in the context of
prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) since sustained
healthy dietary changes can improve many risk factors.
Benefits of the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) on health
is well established in the literature, and the MedDiet is now
recognized as one of the best models of food patterns pro-
viding protection against chronic diseases, such as CVD
(Estruch et al., 2013; Sofi et al., 2013). Although feasibility
to adopt the MedDiet principles among non-Mediterranean
population has been previously reported, maintenance of
dietary changes remains a challenge on the long term
(Bemelmans et al., 2000; Goulet et al., 2003) and might be
improved by considering motivational factors related to
eating regulation.
It has been reported that differences between men and
women exist with respect to eating habits (Arganini et al.,
2012; Wardle et al., 2004). Therefore, gender differences in
motivational factors related to eating regulation need to be
examined and considered within nutritional approaches to
improve their efficacy. In this sense, gender differences in
the level of eating-related self-determined motivation were
previously reported, with women reporting higher level of
self-determined motivation than men (Leblanc et al., 2015a).
However, potential differences between men and women
related to changes in self-determined motivation in response
to a nutritional intervention based on the SDT remain
unknown.
Only few studies examined self-determined motivation
in a dietary context. More importantly, none has focused on
gender differences in the impact of a nutritional interven-
tion aimed at increasing self-determined motivation. The
objective of this study was therefore to determine gender
differences in short- and long-term effects of a 12-week
nutritional intervention program based on the SDT and pro-
moting the adoption of the MedDiet on changes in eating-
related self-determined motivation and in adherence to the
MedDiet.
Methodology
Participants
This study was conducted among a sample of 64 men and
59 premenopausal women aged between 25 and 50
years
and recruited through different media advertisements in the
Québec City Metropolitan area, Canada. In women, a folli-
cle-stimulating hormone (FSH) measurement was per-
formed if needed (e.g. when women presented periods
irregularities) to confirm the premenopausal status
(FSH<20IU/L) (Landgren et al., 2004). Men and women
had to present slightly elevated low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, that is, between 3.0
and 4.9mmol/L (Grundy et al., 2004) or a total-C to high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio 5, and at
least one of the four following criteria of the metabolic syn-
drome (NCEP ATP III, 2002): (1) triglyceride concentra-
tions 1.7
mmol/L, (2) fasting glycemia between 6.1 and
6.9
mmol/L, (3) blood pressure measurements
130/85
mm
Hg, and (4) waist circumference 80cm in
women and 94
cm in men (International Diabetes
Federation, 2006). Participants also had to have a stable
body weight (±2.5kg) for a minimum of 3months prior to
the beginning of the study and to be involved in food pur-
chases and/or preparation at home. Men and women who
had cardiovascular events and used medication that could
affect dependent variables under study, that is, hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, and diabetes, were excluded. Pregnant
women, smokers, participants with an alcoholism history,
or with a high Mediterranean score (Medscore>29, that is,
food pattern already highly concordant with the MedDiet)
(Goulet et al., 2003) were also excluded. All participants
voluntarily agreed to participate in the research project and
written informed consent was obtained from all men and
women prior to their participation in the study. This study
was approved by the "Laval University" Research Ethics
Committee. Previous publications using data from those
participants examined gender differences in dietary, anthro-
pometric, and metabolic changes (Leblanc et al., 2014;
Leblanc et al., 2015b), but did not assess motivational
mechanism through which those changes occurred follow-
ing a nutritional intervention based on SDT within a gender
perspective.
Study design
The 12-week nutritional program was based on the SDT.
This theory relies on the quality of the motivation that regu-
lates behaviors and lies on a continuum from lower to
higher self-determined motivation forms (extending from
amotivation to intrinsic motivation) (Ryan and Deci, 2000)
(Figure 1). Dietitians who provided the intervention used a
motivational interviewing (MI) approach. MI is a practical
set of intervention strategies well-developed and field-
tested in the context of clinical interventions (Resnicow
and McMaster, 2012) and is largely consistent with SDT
premises on motivation and lasting behavior change. MI
has been used to test SDT constructs (Patrick and Williams,
2012; Vansteenkiste and Sheldon, 2006). The study was
conducted into small groups (from January 2010 to
November 2012), and the nutritional intervention included
three group sessions, three individual sessions, and four
follow-up phone calls with a registered dietitian (Figure 2).
Three registered dietitians were trained to provide a stand-
ardized intervention, and participants always met with the
Leblanc et al. 3
same dietitian during individual sessions. The first group
session was a lecture, always provided by the same dietitian
and aiming at explaining principles of the traditional
MedDiet (length: 2.5
hours, n=13­25 participants/group).
At week 4, men and women actively participated in a
3-hour Mediterranean cooking lesson during which they
had to cook a Mediterranean meal (n=8­14 participants/
group). At week 8, they shared a 3-hour Mediterranean pot-
luck dinner aimed at discussing barriers met in adopting
dietary recommendations since the beginning of the inter-
vention (n
=
5­12 participants/group). Face-to-face indi-
vidual counseling took place at weeks 1, 5, and 10 and
lasted between 45minutes and 1hour for each appointment.
Individual follow-up phone calls took place at weeks 3, 6,
9, and 12, and each lasted for about 20­30
minutes. The
main objective of face-to-face individual counseling and
follow-up phone calls was to assess dietary changes and to
determine progressive personal goals with potential and

realistic strategies aimed at improving the adherence to
MedDiet principles. In accordance with the SDT (Ryan and
Deci, 2000), basic psychological needs (i.e. autonomy,
competence, and relatedness) were supported during the
nutritional intervention in order to increase self-determined
motivation. More specifically, competence was promoted
during the lecture aimed at increasing nutritional and health
knowledge of individuals by presenting key principles of
the traditional MedDiet (group session 1), and during the
Mediterranean cooking lesson by actively involving indi-
viduals in the preparation of different Mediterranean foods
and exploring with them different tastes and ways to
increase variety in cooking methods, foods seasoning, and
so on (group sessions 2 and 3). Autonomy of men and
women was promoted as they had to choose their own die-
tary objectives during individual counseling sessions, the
best strategies to reach their objectives, as well as to iden-
tify actions to overcome potential barriers related to dietary
changes. Men and women were also responsible to choose
their own progress speed toward dietary changes during the
intervention. Relatedness was fostered by the dietitian dur-
ing all individual counseling sessions and follow-up phone
calls by considering individual's social and family contexts
in facilitating factors and barriers toward dietary changes,
and also in group sessions by promoting sharing about dif-
ficulties and strategies among participants. Different tools
congruent with the SDT tenets were used during these ses-
sions to formulate dietary objectives while increasing self-
determined motivation. More precisely, the decisional
balance allowed assessment of pros and cons of keeping
dietary habits stable as well as pros and cons of changing
dietary habits. The action plan was used to determine con-
crete dietary objectives, that is, the starting point for the
change, frequency of adoption of the behavior, perceived
benefits from the behavior change, main strategies consid-
ered to achieve the change, actions planned to overcome
barriers, and potential people who would support them into
their process of dietary changes. The dietitian had a client-
centered approach and put no pressure on participants about
the type of dietary objectives to be chosen. In addition, no
emphasis was put on body weight control. Men and women
were encouraged to maintain dietary changes in an autono-
mous way at the end of the nutritional program, and there
was no additional contact with the dietitian after the end of
the 12-week intervention.
Measurements of dependent variables
All measurements were performed before (t=0) and after
the 12-week nutritional intervention program (t=3months),
and then 3 and 6
months after the end of the nutritional
intervention (t=6months and t=9months, respectively).
Motivational variables.The regulation of eating behaviors
scale (Pelletier et al., 2004) is a 24-item validated
questionnaire that assesses self-determined motivation for
the regulation of eating behaviors. Items included in this
questionnaire (four items per self-determined regulatory
styles) assess intrinsic motivation (e.g. "I like to find new
ways to create meals that are good for my health"), differ-
ent self-determined regulatory styles which are integrated
(e.g. "Eating healthy is an integral part of my life"), identi-
fied (e.g. "I believe it will eventually allow me to feel bet-
ter"), introjected (e.g. "I feel I must absolutely be thin"),
external (e.g. "Other people close to me insist that I do"),
and amotivation (e.g. "I don't know why I bother"). Evalu-
ation of the internal consistency of the subscales revealed
to be adequate (Cronbach's alphas ranged from 0.79 to
0.91) (Pelletier et al., 2004). Each item is measured on a
7-point Likert scale, which allows calculation of the self-
determination index (SDI) (Vallerand, 1997), specific to
eating regulation.
Health care climate.The Health Care Climate Question-
naire is a 15-item validated questionnaire (Williams and
Deci, 2001) which assesses clients'perception of the degree
to which their practitioner is autonomy-supportive. In our
study, the word "practitioner" was replaced by the word
"dietitian." Cronbach's alpha reliability for the 15 items of
this questionnaire has consistently been above 0.90 (Wil-
liams and Deci, 2001). This scale includes three dimen-
sions considered essential for an optimally supportive
health care context, which reflect autonomy support (e.g. "I
feel that the dietitian has provided me choices and options"),
involvement (e.g. "The dietitian handles peoples' emotions
very well"), and structure (e.g. "The dietitian has made sure
I understand the links between foods and health and which
dietary changes I can do to improve my diet"). Each item is
measured on a 7-point scale (from disagree to strongly
agree) and allows calculation of a global score (range=15­
105), with a higher average score representing a higher
level of perceived autonomy support.
Dietary variables. A validated food frequency questionnaire
(FFQ) (Goulet et al., 2004) was administered by a regis-
tered dietitian. The FFQ is based on typical foods available
in Québec and contains 91 items and 33 subquestions. Par-
ticipants were questioned about the frequency of intake of
different foods and drinks during the last month and could
report the frequency of these intakes in terms of day, week,
or month. As previously described (Goulet et al., 2003), the
Medscore was calculated based on the FFQ and allowed to
assess the level of adherence to the Mediterranean food pat-
tern, which could vary between 0 and 44 points. Compo-
nents of the Medscore are as follows: grains (whole and
refined); fruits (whole and juices); vegetables (whole and
juices); legumes, nuts, and seeds; olive oil (including
olives); dairy products; fish (including seafoods); poultry;
eggs; sweets; and red meat/processed meat. Briefly, a high
consumption of food groups promoted by the MedDiet
Leblanc et al. 5
(bottom of the pyramid) (e.g. legumes) contributed to
increase the Medscore, whereas a high consumption of
food groups at the top of the Mediterranean pyramid (e.g.
red meat) contributed to decrease the Medscore, as previ-
ously described (Goulet et al., 2003).
Anthropometric and metabolic profile. According to standard-
ized procedures (Lohman et al., 1988), height was meas-
ured to the nearest millimeter with a stadiometer (Seca 222
Mechanical Telescopic Stadiometer), body weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1
kg on a calibrated balance
(BWB-800S Digital scale, Tanita), and body mass index
(BMI) was then calculated. Waist circumference measure
was also taken to the nearest millimeter according to stand-
ardized procedures (Lohman et al., 1988). Blood lipids and
glucose level were measured after a 12-hour overnight fast.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The Student's
t-test allowed comparisons of baseline characteristics, and
also the health care climate, between men and women.
Motivational variables measured are presented as
means±standard deviations for the baseline value but oth-
erwise as changes±standard deviations. Mixed models for
repeated measurements, which allow the inclusion of par-
ticipants with missing data at some time points (Beunckens
et al., 2005), were performed to determine gender, time,
and gender by time interaction effects on changes in
dependent variables measured (delta values). Delta values
were calculated as post-nutritional intervention values
(post-nutritional intervention minus pre-nutritional inter-
vention values) and as follow-up values at t=6months
(6months minus pre-nutritional intervention values) and at
t=9months (9months minus pre-nutritional intervention
values), respectively. Using this approach, a significant
time effect means that the magnitude of the change is vary-
ing with time, while a non-significant time effect means
that changes are maintained with time. Moreover, a signifi-
cant gender by time interaction means that the trajectory of
changes with time is not the same in men and women. The
Lsmean procedure, which can be defined as a linear combi-
nation (sum) of the estimated effects, for example, means,
from a linear model and based on the model used, allowed
determining significant changes in outcomes over time
within each gender. Pairwise differences between and
within gender were further tested with the Tukey­Kramer
adjustment. Pearson's correlation analyses were performed
to examine associations between eating-related SDI, adher-
ence to the Medscore and BMI, in men and women sepa-
rately.Afterwards, covariance analyses (Lsmean procedure)
were performed to determine whether an interaction
between gender and changes in eating-related SDI explains
changes in the Medscore, and whether or not this relation
remains the same after controlling for baseline eating-
related SDI. For variables not normally distributed, a trans-
formation was performed, but these variables are presented
as raw data in the tables. For determination of sample size,
we considered a difference of 35
percent in the change in
Medscore as being clinically significant, based on previous
results (Goulet et al., 2003). Therefore, a final sample size
of 45 men and 45 women was needed to detect a difference
of 35percent in the change in Medscore between men and
women with a power of 0.80 and alpha of 0.05, considering
that standard deviation corresponds to 55
percent of the
mean of the change in Medscore. The probability level for
significance used for the interpretation of all statistical
analyses was set at an alpha level of p0.05.

had higher BMI, waist circumference, total-C to HDL-C
ratio, and triglyceride levels than women, whereas women
had higher HDL-C levels than men. Of the 64 men and 59
premenopausal women included in our study at baseline,
89, 78, and 69percent of men and 86, 78, and 75percent of
women completed assessments at the end of the 12-week
nutritional intervention program (t=3months), and at
t=6months and t=9months post intervention follow-up
visits, respectively, without significant gender differences
in the attrition rate at any of the three visits. Moreover,
men and women who withdrew from the study presented
similar characteristics at baseline to those who completed
the intervention until the end of the follow-up (not shown).
Level of perceived autonomy support from the
dietitian
No gender difference was observed for the health care cli-
mate measured at the end of the nutritional intervention,
that is, men and women similarly perceived that their dieti-
tian was autonomy-supportive during the 12-week nutri-
tional intervention program (98.0±8.5 in men and 97.6±8.9
in women; t-test, p=0.81).
Changes in eating-related self-determined
motivation and in adherence to the MedDiet
Changes in eating-related SDI and its different subscales of
regulatory styles in men and women are presented in Table 2.
Changes observed in eating-related SDI were larger in men
than in women in response to the 12-week nutritional inter-
vention and at follow-up (gender effect, p=0.04). Similarly, a
trend for larger changes was observed in integrated regulatory
style in men than in women in response to the intervention
and at follow-up (gender effect, p=0.08). However, for these
variables, the magnitude of change decreased with time (time
effects, p
=
0.0002 for eating-related SDI and p=0.008 for
integrated regulation). Significant changes in intrinsic moti-
vation were observed in both men and women in response to
the intervention, but no gender difference was observed.
Moreover, this variable tended to return toward baseline val-
ues during follow-up (time effect, p=0.08). Although signifi-
cant decreases in amotivation were observed in response to
the nutritional intervention in men only, no gender difference
was observed, and this variable progressively returned toward
baseline values during follow-up in both men and women
(time effect, p
=
0.002). No gender by time interaction was
observed for changes in eating-related SDI nor its different
subscales, meaning that trajectories of changes during the
follow-up were not significantly different between men and
women. When changes in eating-related SDI and its sub-
scales of regulatory styles were adjusted for the baseline
value of the response variable, significant gender differences
and trend for gender differences initially observed all became
non-significant.
As for changes in adherence to the MedDiet, a significant
increase was observed in the Medscore in men and women in
response to the nutritional intervention and at follow-up
(22.7±4.3, 27.6±4.7, 25.4±4.8, 24.6±4.6units in men and
24.1±3.6, 27.2±4.9, 25.8±4.2, 24.9±5.1units in women, at
baseline, after the 12-week nutritional intervention, at
t=6months and t=9months, respectively), but without gen-
der differences (gender effect, p=0.25). However, the
Medscore progressively returned toward baseline values
during the follow-up in men and women with a significant
time effect (time effect, p<0.0001). Moreover, no gender by
time interaction was observed for the Medscore, meaning
that trajectories of changes during the follow-up were the
same in men and women (gender by time interaction,
p
=
0.42). Regarding changes in BMI, significant decreases
were observed in both men and women after the end of the
nutritional intervention and at follow-up (30.8
±
4.4,
30.2±4.0, 30.1±3.5, 30.0±3.8kg/m2 in men and 29.6±6.0,
29.4±6.0, 29.7±6.2, 29.6±6.3kg/m2 in women, at baseline,
t=3months, t=6months, and t=9months, respectively), but
no gender differences were found (gender effect, p=0.18).
Pattern of associations between eating-related
SDI and adherence to the MedDiet according to
gender, in response to the 12-week intervention
and at follow-up
In men, a significant and positive association was found
between changes in eating-related SDI and changes in the
Medscore in response to the intervention (r=0.41,
p
=
0.002), as well as between changes observed in these
variables at t=9months (r=0.39, p=0.009) (Table 3).Also,
a trend for a negative association between changes in eat-
ing-related SDI and changes in BMI (r=-0.26, p=0.06)
was observed in response to the intervention in men, and
this negative association was significant for changes meas-
ured at t=9months (r=-0.33, p
=
0.03). In women, no
association was observed between changes in eating-related
SDI and changes in the Medscore measured either at the
end of the intervention (r=-0.08, p=0.57) or at follow-up
(r=-0.03, p=0.84) (Table 3). Moreover, although no asso-
ciation was found between changes in eating-related SDI
and changes in BMI in response to the intervention in
women, a significant and negative association was observed
between changes in these variables measured at t=9months
(r=-0.40, p=0.007).
Additional analyses were performed to further docu-
ment the differences observed between men and women in
the association between changes in SDI and changes in the
Medscore. Accordingly, a significant interaction was
observed between gender and changes in eating-related
SDI in the determination of changes in the Medscore in
response to the intervention (interaction, p=0.02). In order
to verify if higher baseline level of eating-related SDI found
in women would contribute to explain this interaction (i.e.
Leblanc et al. 7
differences between men and women in the association
between changes in SDI and changes in the Medscore),
baseline level of eating-related SDI was added to the model
of covariance. It was found that the interaction between
gender and changes in eating-related SDI in the determina-
tion of changes in the Medscore remains significant despite

to the 12-week nutritional intervention program and at follow-up.

Discussion
The aim of our study was to determine gender differences
in the impact of a nutritional intervention program based on
the SDT and promoting the MedDiet on eating-related
motivation and adherence to the MedDiet. Results indicate
that men and women perceived the motivational approach
as autonomy-supportive in a similar manner although it led
to larger increases in self-determined motivation in men
than in women. Moreover, increases in eating-related self-
determined motivation were associated with increases in
adherence to the MedDiet in men only.
Changes observed in eating-related self-determined
motivation evolved in a similar direction in men and women
as no gender by time interaction was observed. However,
larger increases in eating-related self-determined motiva-
tion were observed in men than in women in response to the
12-week intervention and at follow-up. The SDT posits that
a context fostering satisfaction of autonomy, competence,
and relatedness is essential in promoting self-determined
motivation (Deci and Ryan, 1985; Ryan and Deci, 2000).
Accordingly, different aspects of our nutritional interven-
tion aimed at promoting satisfaction of these psychological
needs. More precisely, competence of men and women was
promoted by the Mediterranean cooking lesson, the
Mediterranean potluck dinner, and by nutritional informa-
tion and practical tools discussed during individual and
group sessions. The need for relatedness was fostered by
the development of a relationship based on trust, considera-
tion, and collaboration between the dietitian and the partici-
pant, by the group cohesion promoted between participants
during group sessions and also by the consideration of
important others in the action plan for dietary changes.
Then, autonomy was supported when individuals had to
determine their personal dietary objectives, the best strate-
gies regarding the objectives, and the key factors to over-
come barriers. Moreover, recipes and nutritional tools were
not automatically provided to individuals but rather given
according to individuals' needs.
In regard to the impact of our intervention in men and
women, factors that can explain why women did not
increase their level of eating-related self-determined moti-
vation as much as men, such as level of eating-related self-
determined motivation at baseline, need to be considered.
Indeed, as women reported higher level of eating-related
self-determined motivation than men at baseline, room for
improvement in motivation could have been more limited
for women than men. In this regard, the adjustment for the
baseline value of the response variable indicated that if a
similar level of eating-related self-determined motivation
at baseline had been observed in men and women, no sig-
nificant gender difference would have been found in
changes in eating-related self-determined motivation. In
addition, despite the fact that men and women perceived
the intervention as similarly autonomy-supportive, it can be
hypothesized that gender differences exist in the level of
need satisfaction for autonomy, competence, and related-
ness specific to the dietary context. However, to our knowl-
edge, no validated questionnaire allows assessment of the
satisfaction of the psychological needs specific to the die-
tary context. Moreover, a better understanding of the impact
of the health care climate in men and women on changes in
eating-related self-determined motivation could be
achieved in future studies by assessing perceived level of
satisfaction of the psychological needs at different time
points of an intervention. Indeed, data from a recent quali-
tative study in the field of physical activity reported that
satisfaction of the needs for competence and relatedness
were essential during the phase of adoption of the exercise
behavior, while satisfaction of autonomy had more impact

in the maintenance phase (Kinnafick et al., 2014). Those
results suggest that stages of development of these needs
might differ and should be considered in order to facilitate
internalization of non-self-determined regulatory styles
toward more self-determined regulatory styles. In addition,
the idea of monitoring people on a daily basis using an
ecological momentary assessment technique could be
interesting as previous studies reported within-person fluc-
tuations in psychological need satisfaction (Verstuyf et al.,
2012).
The fact that eating-related self-determined motivation
returned toward baseline values in both men and women
underlines the difficulty to maintain motivation changes.
Despite 12
weeks of intervention aimed to internalize
motivational factors related to the adoption of a diet of
better quality, the transition between the end of the inter-
vention program and the follow-up period and the com-
plete absence of support during the follow-up seem to
represent critical points to consider. Moreover, intrinsic
motivation, that is, highest level of eating-related self-
determined motivation and which refers to undertaking an
activity for its inherent interest and enjoyment, might be
more difficult to maintain than other types of motivation
(Resnicow and McMaster, 2012; Verstuyf et al., 2012).
This can partly be explained by the fact that the delay to
internalize intrinsic motivation might have been insuffi-
cient. It is also possible that attempts to maintain dietary
intakes were directed more to other outcomes such as to
improve health condition or decrease body weight, which
could have thwarted the intrinsic motivation toward
changing dietary habits per se (e.g. for the interest and
pleasure of eating or preparing food according to the
MedDiet) (Verstuyf et al., 2012). Although the magnitude
of the changes in eating-related self-determined motiva-
tion also decreased with time among men, level of moti-
vation remained significantly higher than at baseline,
suggesting a non-negligible impact from the nutritional
intervention program on motivational factors. In addition,
previous results demonstrate that our intervention based
on a motivational approach had a beneficial impact on the
adoption of healthy dietary intakes and risk factors for
CVD such as waist circumference and lipid profile, more
particularly in men (Leblanc et al., 2014).
To our knowledge, assessment of the influence of
changes in motivation on changes in the adherence to the
MedDiet according to gender is a novelty in the literature.
We found that an increase in eating-related self-determined
motivation was associated with an increase in the adher-
ence to the MedDiet in response to the 12-week interven-
tion as well as at follow-up, in men but not in women.
Moreover, additional analyses revealed that differences
found between men and women in the association between
changes in motivation and changes in adherence to the
MedDiet may not be explained by gender differences in
the level of eating-related self-determined motivation at
baseline. This suggests that other gender-related factors are
involved to explain these differences in the pattern of asso-
ciations between eating-related self-determined motivation
and adherence to the MedDiet. Those factors may be related
to eating-related attitudes, behaviors and norms, societal
role, and responsibilities attributed to men and women
(Institute of Gender and Health, 2012; Wang and Worsley,
2014).Although these factors were not specifically assessed
in our study, some components of the nutritional interven-
tion program may have better suited men than women.
Previous studies indicate that men are more ambivalent
than women toward healthy eating choices (Povey et al.,
2001; Sparks et al., 2001); therefore supporting our hypoth-
esis that tools used in our intervention and aimed at increas-
ing eating-related self-determined motivation such as the
decisional balance might have been more beneficial for
men than women.
As no previous study assessed gender differences in
changes in eating-related self-determined motivation, sev-
eral hypotheses remain to be verified in the future regard-
ing basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence,
and relatedness in the dietary context and potential modera-
tors in the association between changes in motivation and
changes in dietary intakes to allow a better understanding
of the influence of the quality of the motivation in the con-
text of healthy eating in both men and women. The fact that
men and women recruited in our study were middle-aged
adults and presented specific characteristics regarding
CVD risk limits the generalization of our results to the
whole population. Moreover, although missing data could
contribute to overestimate changes found at follow-up in
self-determined motivation in men and women, gender dif-
ferences observed are unlikely to be influenced by this pos-
sible bias since the attrition rate was the same in men and
women. Nevertheless, this study has important strengths
and clinical implications that need to be mentioned. Our
nutritional education program was developed based on the
SDT, which facilitated and guided our methods of interven-
tion. Moreover, this study design allowed the assessment of
long-term impact of a nutritional intervention, during which
individuals were actively involved in the process of dietary
changes followed by a 6-month period with no additional
support provided which can be more representative of a
real-life setting. Our results showed that a nutritional inter-
vention program promoting active involvement of individ-
uals in the determination of dietary changes and strategies
had a positive impact on eating-related self-determined
motivation, which in turn contributed to improve the level
of adherence to the MedDiet in men only. As a matter of
fact, motivational factors seem to be an important target of
intervention in the context of dietary changes in men. As
for women, our results suggest that other factors may have
possibly interfered in the association between motivational
changes and changes in adherence to the MedDiet, and thus
indicate that health professionals should explore factors
10 Health Psychology Open 
besides motivation to properly support women in the con-
text of dietary changes.
Overall, although both men and women increased their
adherence to the MedDiet in response to the nutritional
intervention, results indicate that the nutritional interven-
tion program aimed at promoting eating-related self-deter-
mined motivation in order to improve the quality of the diet
seems to fit better men than women as changes in eating-
related self-determined motivation were associated with
increases in adherence to the MedDiet in men only.
