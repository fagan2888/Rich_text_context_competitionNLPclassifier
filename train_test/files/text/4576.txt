Introduction
Safeguarding one's own health is a central topic for health
promotion according to the bio-psycho-social approach
(World Health Organization, 1986), which considers persons
as active subjects making reference to a system of resources,
which are material, cognitive, emotional, and relational
(Capone and Petrillo, 2013). In this regard, it appears rele-
vant to understand better where persons stand with respect to
that set of beliefs surrounding the paranormal sphere, which
may become operative when one has to deal with issues
related to health, thus influencing one's coping strategies,
outcome expectancies, and the display of harmful behaviors.
Furthermore, it is important to understand the role of illusory
beliefs about health even in the diagnostic and therapeutic
process, and their eventual impact on the outcome, such as
adherence to medical prescriptions and the duration and the
result of the treatment (Capone, 2016). In fact, it has already
been shown that irrational beliefs about health were signifi-
cant predictors of adherence to rehabilitative care in persons
affected by cardiovascular diseases and diabetes (Anderson
and Emery, 2014).
Paranormal beliefs are convictions relative to any phe-
nomenon that in one or more ways exceeds the limits of
what is deemed to be physically possible according to pre-
vailing scientific assumptions. Several studies have shown
the multidimensionality of such systems of beliefs (Aarnio
and Lindeman, 2004; Utinans et al., 2015).
Significant associations with other constructs were also
highlighted. Particularly, in relation to the locus of control,
some studies found that persons who believe in the paranor-
mal have a generally higher tendency for external locus of
control (Newby and Davis, 2004;Tobacyk and Milford, 1983).
In contrast, according to the Cognitive Adaptation Theory
(Taylor and Lobel, 1989), the tendency to develop illusory
beliefs is found just in those persons who, in a way, give up on
seeking an explanation for threatening circumstances or expe-
riences that are otherwise difficult for them to explain--such
as being afflicted by an illness--in terms of, for example, the
Validation of the Paranormal Health
Beliefs Scale for adults
Anna Rosa Donizzetti and Giovanna Petrillo
Abstract
We present the validation study of the Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale adult version, aimed to measure illusory
beliefs about health. The scale was administered to 643 participants (54.3% females), having an average age of 29.7
years (standard deviation
=
18.31). The results of the analyses confirmed the dimensions of the Paranormal Health
Beliefs Scale as developed in the previous adolescent study (Beliefs: Religious, Superstitious, in Extraordinary Events,
Parapsychological, and Pseudo-scientific of a biomedical nature), as well as the convergent and discriminant validity
through the correlation with other constructs (locus of control and self-efficacy). The results also showed significant
differences between subgroups by gender and age. The Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale shows satisfactory psychometric
properties and thus may be used effectively to identify the varied range of illusory beliefs related to health, even within
the context of lifelong educational programs aimed at health promotion.

conviction of being able to personally control the course of the
illness, or the treatment. Self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) must
be considered among the associations investigated with regard
to illusory beliefs: persons having high levels of illusory
beliefs should present low levels of self-efficacy (Tobacyk and
Shrader, 1991). Understandably, the absence of a sense of self-
efficacy, in circumstances that a person feels are potentially
threatening and unavoidable, such as the appearance of symp-
toms or the onset of an illness, might trigger an anxiety diffi-
cult to deal with: thus, having at one's disposal a complex set
of knowledge, even if baseless, such as beliefs in paranormal
phenomena, can be very comforting.
The relationship between the paranormal and health has
been accepted by some in terms of self-serving illusions
(Taylor and Brown, 1988), in other words, illusory beliefs
that are certainly false, but which, however, allow the funda-
mental function for mental health to create a "filter" through
which reality acquires its own order and meaning. On the
subject, several studies have investigated the relationship
between paranormal beliefs and mental health (Dag, 1999),
finding the existence of a significant and positive correlation
with mental illness (Kelly, 2011; Thalbourne, 1994) and with
manic-depressive experiences (Thalbourne and French,
1995); other studies have found some contradictory results
on the relationships between paranormal beliefs, neuroticism
(Lester and Monoghan, 1995; Thalbourne et al., 1995), and
anxiety (Okebukola, 1986; Tobacyk, 1982). Furthermore, a
line of studies dealt with beliefs in complementary and alter-
native medicine (Bishop et al., 2007), and paranormal beliefs
were found as the strongest predictor of complementary and
alternative medicine beliefs (Pettersen and Olsen, 2007; Van
den Bulck and Custers, 2010). Other studies, with differ-
ences across gender and nationality, have found that some
types of beliefs, such as religious and fatalistic, may inhibit
health care utilization and health care behaviors, leading to
poor health outcomes (Franklin et al., 2007; Gall et al.,
2005). Petrillo and Donizzetti (2012) instead have consid-
ered illusory beliefs specifically related to the sphere of
health, such as the beliefs and practices of prompt healing,
protection from disease, and health promotion. From this
study, it has emerged that adolescents have little tendency to
believe in paranormal; furthermore, the boys have more con-
fidence in medicine as science and have a tendency to rely on
a biomedical approach in relation to the protection of the spe-
cies because they have been socialized to take more interest
in and to be better informed about scientific matters than
other issues (Irwin, 1993; Zusne and Jones, 1982). Finally,
there was a greater anchoring to the religious faith and faith
in "medical science" in younger people.
Review of instruments
At first time, the paranormal belief had been considered as an
expression of a relatively stable personality characteristic,
with the consequent definition of one-dimensional instruments
(Randall and Desrosiers, 1980). Subsequently, Scheidt's
(1973) hypothesis was established about the existence of two
or more relatively independent dimensions (Clarke, 1991;
Grimmer and White, 1990; Sobal and Emmons, 1982;
Thalbourne and Delin, 1993). Indeed, studies carried out
since the 1990s have shown the multidimensionality of such
systems of beliefs (Grimmer and White, 1990), which include
dimensions related to alternative therapies, paratherapies, and
functional and structural parapsychology (together with pop-
ular science, obscure unbelief, and traditional religion). The
best known instrument for detecting paranormal beliefs is the
Paranormal Belief Scale, developed by Tobacyk (1988, 2004;
Tobacyk and Milford, 1983) and validated in various contexts
(Bouvet et al., 2014; Díaz-Vilela and Álvarez-González,
2004; Utinans et al., 2015). Starting with a review of interna-
tional literature on paranormal beliefs, as well as of ethno-
graphic and psychosocial cutting literature, Petrillo and
Donizzetti (2012) have developed the Paranormal Health
Beliefs Scale (PHBS) that investigated adolescents' adher-
ence to the system of paranormal beliefs about health. The
scale consists of 31 items that are distributed in five related
dimensions: Religious Beliefs (RB) (
=
.90), Superstitious
Beliefs (SB) (
=
.83), Extraordinary Events Beliefs (EEB)
(
=
.79), Parapsychological Beliefs (PsiB) (
=
.73), and
Pseudo-scientific Beliefs of a biomedical nature (MedB)
(
=
.67). To examine whether three factors tapped the same
dimension, a second-order confirmatory factor analysis was
conducted. This model fitted the data very well. Results high-
lighted =.91. Furthermore, the construct and criterion valid-
ity were satisfactory. There are no other instruments in the
review of literature that can detect paranormal beliefs related
to health.
Aims and hypothesis
Considering the lack of measures in this specific field, the
objective of this study was to attain the validation of the
adult's version of the PHBS (Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012)
for adolescents. This scale is designed to measure the level
of adhesion to illusory beliefs about health, understood as a
complex and extensive system of beliefs, ranging from the
superstitious and magical to those about the power of the
mind and healers, as well as those of a traditional religious
type. For this purpose, we proposed to verify the psycho-
metric properties of the PHBS (dimensionality, reliability,
and construct and content validity, as well as convergent and
discriminant validity), and the existence of differences
according to gender and age, in order to prove that the PHBS
is suitable to be usefully employed for the detection of the
articulated range of the construct within the population.
It was hypothesized that the PHBS, adult version, would
have a multidimensional structure with five factors that
would converge in a single second-order dimension. In rela-
tion to the verification of the validity of the instrument, con-
sidering the above-mentioned literature on the subject, a
Donizzetti and Petrillo 3
good content and construct validity was hypothesized. It was
expected that the concurrent validity would result in a sig-
nificant and positive correlation between the scale used to
measure the central construct in our study, and the scale used
to measure the affine construct of external Health Locus of
Control (HLC). However, regarding the discriminant valid-
ity, we hypothesized a significant and negative correlation
between the Paranormal Health Beliefs (PHB) measure and
the measure of Internal Health Locus of Control, which is a
construct complementary to that previously considered, as
well as a low negative correlation or a nil correlation with the
General Self-Efficacy (GSE) 
measure. Finally, we hypothe-
sized differences between subgroups by gender and age, in
line with literature available on the subject (Aarnio and
Lindeman, 2005; Lange et al., 2000).
Method
Participants and procedures
We used a snowball sampling that relied on referral from
initial participants, starting from University Students
(through word-of-mouth) to generate additional partici-
pants. A convenience sample of people was composed by
643 persons almost equally divided by gender (45.7%
males and 54.3% females), with ages ranging between 18
and 80
years and an average of 29.7
years (SD=18.31),
grouped in the following four categories: youngsters
(18years old)=48.1percent; young adults (19­30years
old)=22.1percent; adults (31­60years old)=19.3percent;
elderly persons (61­80years old)=10.6percent. All partici-
pants filled in an anonymous questionnaire on their own.
Measures and analyses
Making use of a quantitative methodology, a questionnaire
containing various instruments was specifically designed.
The Paranormal Health Beliefs Scale (PHBS) follows the
version developed in a pilot study (Petrillo and Donizzetti,
2012), from which emerged five dimensions of illusory
beliefs about health: RB (eight items), which invoke faith,
God, the guardian angels, and the saints, as well as the cult
related to their relics, as elements of a speedy recovery, pro-
tection from illness, and health promotion; SB (seven items),
related to that combination of superstitious practices that are
believed to ward off direct threats to health or other acciden-
tal or intentional events that may endanger one's health; EEB
(six items), deemed, in some way, to have an influence on
health because of alien entities, forces of the universe,
extraordinary astral phenomena, and the experience of
exceptional conscious states; PsiB (six items), referring to
mental energies as sources of positive or negative influence
on health, such that they may alter physiological parameters
and provoke illness; MedB (four items), which refer to the
negative contribution for the health of the human species by
specific categories that are considered to be deviant or mar-
ginal social groups (homosexuals, immigrants), and to health
threats deriving from hereditary transmission or genetic con-
tamination. The PHBS is composed of 31 items rated on a
5-point Likert-type scale (from 1
=
Strongly Disagree to
5=Strongly Agree): high scores relate to high levels of illu-
sorybeliefsreferringtohealth(seeSupplementaryMaterials).
The General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) of Schwarzer
and Jerusalem (1995; Sibilia et al., 1995) measures the trust
that subjects have in their own competences in facing
adversary events. The Likert-type scale comprises 10 items
with an answering range of 4 points (from 1
=
Totally
Untrue to 4=Totally True).
The Health Locus of Control Scale (HLCS) for adults
(Donizzetti and Petrillo, 2015), useful for the measurement
of the orientation of locus of control related to health in this
population, is composed of three dimensions: Internal
Health Locus of Control (IHLC; eight items), God Health
Locus of Control (GHLC; two items), and Other Health
Locus of Control (OHLC; 3 items). The HLCS is made up
of 13 items, with an answering range of 5 points (from
1
=
Strongly Disagree to 5
=
Strongly Agree). Finally, the
questionnaire included a section for the collection of socio-
demographic data (gender and age).
The verification of the factorial structure was computed
through confirmatory factor analysis of first and second
order, using Lisrel 8.54 software. The difference between the
observed and expected covariance matrices was evaluated by
using the association between the chi-squared distribution
and the degrees of freedom (2/df), as well as Comparative
Fit Index (CFI), Non-Normed Fit Index (NNFI), Root Mean
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), and Standardized
Root Mean Squared Residual (SRMR). The 2/df must be in a
range between 2 and 5; the values of the CFI and of the NNFI
must be>.90; those of RMSEA are considered to be good if
they are <.05 and acceptable if they are <.08 (McNeish et al.,
2017); those of SRMR must be <.09 (Bentle, 1990). The
analysis of reliability was computed by using Cronbach's
alpha, and is considered to be satisfactory if its values are
greater than .70; even an alpha between .60 and .69 would be
considered acceptable (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). The
concurrent and discriminant validity were verified by means
of Pearson's correlation analysis (p-value<.05). The differ-
ences between the subject groups were verified through anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) (p-value<.05). The analyses of
reliability, correlation, and variance were calculated by using
IBM SPSS.22 software.
Results
Verification of the factorial structure, reliability,
and validity
The internal consistency of the PHBS was verified by calcu-
lating the corrected correlation between the score of the
4 Health Psychology Open 
items and the scale. The coefficients were considered ade-
quate (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994) since they ranged
between .33 (item 2) and .68 (item 28). The means of the
items ranged from 1.41 (item 19) to 3.07 (item 48). The SD
ranged between .87 (item 57) and 1.33 (item 2). Therefore,
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation was used in all the
analyses. Confirmatory factor analyses were computed to
ascertain the factor structure of the PHBS. Table 1 shows
that the five-factor structure as emerged with adolescents
(Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012) was confirmed. The oblique
five-factor model fitted the data best, suggesting that PHBS
is best understood in terms of five empirically related
dimensions. The standardized regression coefficient weights
of all variables loading onto their respective factors are
between .47 and .82, with all critical ratios above 1.96
(which means that all the regressions are statistically signifi-
cant at the 95% confidence level). The five dimensions are
related to each other with scores ranging from .45 to .74.
Moreover, in order to verify the convergence of the five
dimensions in the most general construct of illusory beliefs
about health, a second-order confirmatory factor analysis
was also performed (Figure 1). The fit indices were found
to be even better than those in the basic (Table 1). The
regression weights are very close and range from .47 to .82,
and the standardized regression coefficients weights of all
dimensions loading onto second-order factor are between
.47 and .82 with all critical ratios above 1.96. The model fit
indices show similar results as the first-order confirmatory
factor.
The reliability of the instrument resulted as excellent,
with =.92. Besides, reliability was also verified for each
of the PHBS dimensions, with results ranging from satis-
factory to excellent (see Table 2). An analysis of the corre-
lations between the PHBS and its five dimensions, as well
as between these and the GSES and the HLCS, was carried
out for the verification of the construct validity of the
instrument. With reference to the content validity, the
results of the analysis of the correlations demonstrate that
all of the five dimensions of the PHBS are strongly corre-
lated with the PHBS (see Table 2).
With regard to concurrent validity, it was found that the
two dimensions of external HLC are significantly and pos-
itively correlated with all the components of the PHBS;
with regard to the discriminant validity, it was found that
all dimensions of the PHBS, except PsiB, result negatively
correlated with the IHLC. Furthermore, as assumed, results
show that the PHBS is not correlated with GSES (Table 2).
Descriptive statistics
From the descriptive analyses, it resulted that the general
level of PHB is on average equal to 2.07. Higher RB and
PsiB levels were also recorded (M=2.47; 2.44, respec-
tively), while the MedB stands around the average score
(M
=
1.95); lower average scores are those related to the
EEB (M=1.70) and to the SB (M=1.66).
The ANOVA by gender resulted in significant differ-
ences relative to RB (F(1, 641)=6.780; p.009; effect
size=.010) and MedB (F(1, 6413)=10.920; p.001; effect
size=.017). Females have higher levels of RB (MM
=2.36,
MF

=
2.56), while males have higher levels of MedB
(MM
=2.07, MF
=1.86). The ANOVA carried out by age,
taking into consideration the four groupings, showed sig-
nificant differences with respect to most of the dimensions
under study. In the light of the post hoc tests of Tukey, it
resulted that, with regard to the PHB and the dimensions of
the RB and the MedB, the elderly have higher scores when
compared with those of the adults, young adults, and the
youngsters. Moreover, the elderly and youngsters have
higher scores than young adults and adults regarding the
SB dimension (see Table 3). In addition, the effect of the
interaction between gender and age was also verified and
it resulted as not significant in all of the emerged
dimensions.
Discussion and conclusion
This study aimed to reach the validation of the PHBS, an
instrument for the assessment of the range of illusory
beliefs about health, through a series of 31 items.
The results, in their entirety, substantially attest the good-
ness of the psychometric properties of the scale. The results
of the confirmatory factor analyses of first and second order,
as well as Cronbach's alpha scores of the scale and the sub-
dimensions, may be considered to be very satisfactory, and
likewise for the validity of content, construct, and criterion,
considering the correlations with the external HLC and the
absence of correlations with the self-efficacy perceptions.

Donizzetti and Petrillo 5
The results of the descriptive analysis clearly show a
scant general tendency for people to believe in the paranor-
mal: all the mean scores are, in fact, below the theoretical
average. In particular, a low tendency to rely on SB and
supernatural forces emerged, while, in line with previous
studies (Petrillo and Donizzetti, 2012; Tobacyk and
Milford, 1983), RB, as seen, reach the highest average
score.

6 Health Psychology Open 
The results emerged through the ANOVAs are interest-
ing but should be considered with caution because of the
low effect size. With respect to differences by gender, the
obtained results belied the idea that women have a more
irrational approach than men or that they would make more
predominant recourse to intuitive rather than analytical
thinking than men (Aarnio and Lindeman, 2005); with ref-
erence to health, in fact, gender differences slightly emerge
with a higher tendency for women to trust in religion and
for men to trust more in medicine as a science and having
an acritical tendency to take a biomedical approach with
respect to the protection of the human species. This result is
in line with the comparisons according to gender about illu-
sory beliefs (Saher and Lindeman, 2005; Tobacyk, 1982;
Tobacyk and Milford, 1983), which show significant differ-
ences only in specific dimensions, thus dispelling the com-
mon conception that women have a higher propensity to
believe in the paranormal. A study about the relationship
between beliefs in paranormal phenomena, alternative
medicine, and magical beliefs about food and health, which
involved a wide Finnish population with an age ranging
from 15 to 60years, demonstrated the null predictive power
of the gender variable with respect to recourse to alterna-
tive medicine (Saher and Lindeman, 2005).
As regards the age differences, it has been confirmed
that the traditional RB are stronger in elderly people than in
young adults (Irwin, 1993). Moreover, referring to SB, the
results--in partial contrast with the findings of the litera-
ture (Lange et al., 2000; Tobacyk et al., 1988)--show that
there is a higher tendency to hold on to illusory beliefs
among the elderly, in line with the social marginality
hypothesis (Emmons and Sobal, 1981). Youthfulness is
highly valued in our society, and the older people constitute
a socially marginal group. Under the social marginality
hypothesis, elderly people should be relatively oriented to
paranormal belief (Irwin, 1993). Moreover, this study is not
directly comparable to those available in the literature since
it considers four age groups at the same time.
Finally, considering the range of beliefs included in this
instrument, which comprises five sub-dimensions (Beliefs:
Religious, Superstitious, in Extraordinary Events,
Parapsychological, and Pseudo-scientific of a biomedical
nature), it can be definitely stated that the PHBS is a rela-
tively agile instrument that can be utilized in a simple way.
Notwithstanding the limits of the study--attributed to the
relatively small number of participants, the cross-sectional
characteristics, the limited territorial origin of the partici-
pants, and self-report data--the results highlight the instru-
ment's potential in evaluating illusory beliefs related to
health. The PHBS can find optimal applications in empiri-
cal studies of the factors that influence the adoption of
healthy behaviors, the adherence to medical therapy, the

efficacy, throughout the entire course of life or during par-
