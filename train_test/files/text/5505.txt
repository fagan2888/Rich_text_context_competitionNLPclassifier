Abstract
Female genital cutting (FGC) involves partial or total removal of the external female genitalia and causes detrimental effects on
woman's physical and psychological health. Estimates suggest that 130 million women and girls have experienced FGC worldwide.
A frequently cited reason for performing this procedure is to restrict female sexuality. To test this idea, we examined women's
willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations (sociosexuality) among the traditional Igbo community in Southeastern
Nigeria, a region in which FGC is prevalent. Women with FGC reported more restricted sociosexuality in all three domains
(attitude, behavior, and desire) compared to women without FGC. Our results suggest that FGC significantly restricts female
extra-pair behavior. We provide evidence that this practice is partially attributable to sexual conflict over reproduction by
decreasing paternity uncertainty and increasing the reproductive costs to women.

Introduction
The World Health Organization (WHO, 2014) defines female
genital cutting (FGC) as procedure(s) that involve partial or
total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury
to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons. According
to the United Nations Children's Fund (2013), approximately
130 million women and girls have undergone FGC worldwide.
Most of these women are located in 29 African countries. FGC
has no health benefits: In fact, women who have undergone
FGC experience many short-term (e.g., serious infections) and
long-term health consequences (e.g., obstetric complications
and posttraumatic stress disorder; Reisel & Creighton, 2015).
The major cause that perpetuates the practice of FGC is
ensuring female conformity with social norms, particularly
with those involving sexual restraint and marriageability (Alm-
roth et al., 2001; Anis, Gheit, Awad, & Saied, 2012; Missailidis
& Gebre-Medhin, 2000; Skaine, 2005). Previous research doc-
uments conflicting results. Some research documents that FGC
decreases women's sexual satisfaction, orgasm frequency, and
sexual desire (Alsibiani & Rouzi, 2010; Andersson, Rymer,
Joyce, Momoh, & Gayle, 2012; Anis et al., 2012; Berg &
Denison, 2012). In contrast, other research documents no
association between women who underwent FGC and the
occurrence of premarital sex or sexual satisfaction (Ahmadu,
2007; Catania et al., 2007; Makhlouf Obermeyer, 2005; Van
Rossem & Gage, 2009). These measures (e.g., premarital sex,
sexual satisfaction, and orgasm frequency) do not fully capture
many important aspects of sociosexuality--defined by Simp-
son and Gangestad (1991) as individual differences in willing-
ness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations. In particular,
previous research has not yet investigated whether women with
FGC are less likely to pursue extramarital affairs than women
without FGC.

Men and women have sometimes conflicting reproductive
interests (Arnqvist & Rowe, 2005; Parker, 1979; Trivers, 1972)
that have produced sex-specific adaptations wherein one sex
manipulates the reproductive interests of the other sex (Arnq-
vist & Rowe, 2005; Gorelik & Shackelford, 2011). For exam-
ple, a woman may commit sexual infidelity, which allows her
to receive benefits from her in-pair partner (e.g., protection,
resources, and paternal care for offspring; Hrdy, 2000; Scelza,
2011, 2013), while receiving different benefits from her extra-
pair partner (e.g., a sire with ``good genes'' for her offspring;
see Gildersleeve, Haselton, & Fales, 2014). Men whose partner
commits sexual infidelity are at risk of cuckoldry--unwitting
investment into genetically unrelated offspring. Estimates doc-
ument that 1­30% of children are fathered by extra-pair copu-
lation (Platek & Porter, 2012). In response to the significant
reproductive costs of cuckoldry, men evolved ``anticuckoldry''
adaptations designed to thwart their partner's sexual infidelity
(e.g., jealousy in response to sexual infidelity; Platek & Shack-
elford, 2006). For example, men who suspect or know about
their partner's sexual infidelity are more likely to perform var-
ious anticuckoldry tactics, including mate retention behaviors
(Buss, 1988; Buss & Shackelford, 1997) and partner-directed
sexual coercion (Finkelhor & Yllo, 1985; Goetz & Shackel-
ford, 2006, 2009). Because the practice of FGC may have been
precipitated by male anticuckoldry tactics, FGC may be perpe-
tuated at the cultural level (e.g., cultural tradition) because of
the patrilocal and patrilineal nature of some societies (e.g., the
Igbo of the current research). Thus, women's motivation to
encourage a female relative to undergo FGC may be a strategy
to increase her marriageability under the context of a male-
dominated society.
The Current Research
Men may benefit from partnering with a woman with FGC
(compared to a woman without FGC). Women with FGC may
experience decreased interest in extramarital relationships and,
consequently, are less likely to place their partner at risk of
cuckoldry. We hypothesize that women who have undergone
FGC will have a more restricted sociosexuality than women
who have not undergone FGC. We used data obtained from the
Igbo people, a preindustrial society living in in Southeastern
Nigeria where it is believed, according to Igbo oral tradition,
that FGC reduces woman's sexual arousal and prevents extra-
marital sexual behavior. This view is consistent with traditional
views of the ancestral origin of FGC in many cultures (e.g.,
Almroth et al., 2001; Anis et al., 2012). Data for testing this
hypothesis are difficult to obtain due to the sensitive nature of
the subject (Reisel & Creighton, 2015). Furthermore, original
African tribes are disappearing or being replaced by modern
equivalents (Gutkind, 1970; Jones, 2014). There is conse-
quently an urgent need to investigate this topic to plan effective
interventions (Abdulcadir, Rodriguez, & Say, 2015). The aim
of this study is to examine whether FGC suppresses woman's
willingness to engage in uncommitted sexual relations.
Material and Method
Participants
Women (N ¼ 93) from a rural Igbo community in South-
eastern Nigeria participated. The Igbos are among the most
populous ethnic group in Nigeria and inhabit five states
of Southeastern Nigeria. The community is located about
50 km from the city center. There is limited exposure to
modern life within the community and no electricity is
supplied to the area. There is no hospital facility and
members of the community travel up to 15 km to access
medical facilities in a nearby community. The major means
of transport is by foot and motorcycles because of the poor
state of the local (unpaved) roads. The community is com-
prised mainly of farmers, the majority of whom live in farm
houses built with local materials. Participants were predomi-
nantly subsistence farmers of extremely low-economic status
(more than half of population is unemployed). We drew our
sample from a single rural community (a village), where FGC
is predominant (see Results section). Although the exact pop-
ulation of the community is not documented, we estimated that
this village contained 120 households. We surveyed all the
available women in the community at the time of the study
and all those who volunteered to participate were included in
the study.
Although FGC is common in most Igbo communities,
research demonstrates that not all women undergo FGC
(Adinma, 1997; Okemgbo, Omideyi, & Odimegwu, 2002;
Snow, Slanger, Okonofua, Oronsaye, & Wacker, 2002). The
reasons that some women do not undergo FGC remain unclear.
Igbo communities do not coerce but rather encourage people to
undergo FGC. Because FGC is performed at an early age, the
family members ultimately influence whether young girls
undergo FGC. However, recent campaigns aimed at discoura-
ging this practice has led to the decline in FGC in most com-
munities. Indeed, women from earlier generations are more
likely to have undergone FGC than females from later
generations.
Igbos are predominantly patrilineal and patrilocal and the
community that we sampled is a typical case. Extended family
significantly influences lives of the Igbo, including aspects
pertaining to marriage choices, fertility, sexual life, and par-
enting (Smith, 2010). The Igbo society places great social
restrictions on women's sexuality. Although there is mild
tolerance when unmarried women participate in casual sexual
encounters, there is zero tolerance when married women par-
ticipate in casual sexual encounters (i.e., infidelity; Smith,
2010). Women who are married are expected to remain sexu-
ally faithful to their partner, even though husbands are
socially permitted to pursue extramarital affairs (Smith,
2010). Further, women have difficulty in remarrying because
the Igbo society frowns upon divorce. Indeed, divorce rates
appear to be relatively low (*2%; Odimegwu & Zerai, 1996).
Thus, female sexuality is highly restricted in the Igbo society
(Smith, 2010).

Procedure
We conducted face-to-face interviews with individual parti-
cipants after obtaining their consent. All interviewers were
female assistants trained by Ike E. Onyishi and Chiedozie
O. Okafor. The questionnaire was used to collect informa-
tion on whether the participant had undergone FGC and, if
so, at what age the FGC was performed. Note that FGC is
both common and socially acceptable among the Igbo peo-
ple, so responses are unlikely to be influenced by social
desirability biases. A total of 75 women self-reported hav-
ing undergone FGC and 18 women did not. Although the
respondents in our study were unable to explain the exact
type of FGC they had, we presumed that majority of them
had the simple excision, which is the commonest type
(98.4% of FGC cases) in Igbo communities (Adinma, 1997).
We asked participants whether they were married (n ¼ 88),
single (n ¼ 3), or divorced (n ¼ 2). Participants reported their
current age, their age when they underwent FGC procedure,
and their sexual orientation (100% reported to be exclusive
heterosexuals).
Measuring Sociosexuality
For purposes of this study, we defined sociosexuality as indi-
vidual willingness to engage in a sexual relationship with other
person than own current sexual partner. We measured socio-
sexuality using the Revised Sociosexual Orientation Inventory
(SOI-R; Penke & Asendorpf, 2008; a ¼ .73), which was trans-
lated into the Igbo language and the responses were coded by
researchers. The SOI-R is a 9-item scale that provides an over-
all measure of sociosexual orientation (SOI--Total score). The
validity and reliability of sociosexuality-type measures have
been established across various cultures, including Africa
(Schmitt, 2005), suggesting that the SOI-R was an appropriate
for the current research. The SOI-R scale has three subscales.
The Behavior subscale (SOI--Behavior) measures the number
of casual sex partners and frequency of change in partners. The
Attitude subscale (SOI--Attitude) measures the participant's
disposition toward short-term sexual encounters. The Desire
subscale (SOI--Desire) measures the frequency of sexual fan-
tasies or arousal in relation to potential mates with whom the
individual is not currently in a committed relationship (see
Appendix for the full version of the SOI-R). A high SOI-R
score indicates unrestricted sociosexual orientation (i.e., a pro-
pensity to engage in more short-term sexual relationships and
to commit infidelity).
Ethics Statement
This research was approved by the Institutional Ethical Com-
mittee, Department of Psychology, University of Nigeria (No:
Ref/Psy/E/14/010). All participants provided verbal consent
to participate in this study. No written consent could be
obtained, because most of the participants were not literate
and could not understand or sign the consent form. All
consents were recorded with paper-and-pencil method. This
consent procedure was approved by the Institutional Ethical
Committee.
Results
Women with FGC (age: M ¼ 38.9, SE ¼ 1.01, n ¼ 75) were
older than women without FGC (age: M ¼ 33.2, SE ¼ 2.1, n ¼
18), t(91) ¼ 2.48, p < .05. Because sociosexuality is correlated
with age (Mesko
´, La
´ng, & Kocsor, 2014), we conducted an
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to predict participants'
SOI-R scores from whether or not they had undergone FGC,
controlling statistically for their age. We conducted Box­Cox
transformations on SOI-R scores to achieve normality. Z2
p
was
used to measure the effect size. Statistical tests were performed
with Statistica (v8, StatSoft 2007, Tulsa, OK, http://
www.statsoft.com).
All participants who underwent FGC reported receiving
the procedure within the first 12 months of their life, the
majority (76%) of whom had undergone the procedure dur-
ing the first 5­8 days of life. In support of the hypothesis,
women with FGC had a significantly lower SOI--Total
score (M ¼ 15.9, SE ¼ 0.65, n ¼ 75) compared with
females without FGC (M ¼ 27.11, SE ¼ 2.1, n ¼ 18),
ANCOVA, F(1, 90) ¼ 31.98, p < .0001, Z2
p
¼ 0.26. The
statistical power of this difference was high (observed
power ¼ 0.99), suggesting that the sample sizes were suf-
ficient for rejecting the null hypothesis. The age of the
women did not have a significant effect on the SOI--Total
score, ANCOVA, F(1, 90) ¼ 2.63, p ¼ .11, Z2
p
¼ 0.03.
Separate ANCOVAs for each of the three SOI-R subscales
showed that women with FGC scored significantly lower on
all three SOI subscales compared with women without FGC
(Table 1). Frequency data for each SOI-R item are shown in
the Appendix. Observed power of statistical tests was very
high for all SOI subscales (Table 1). This suggests that if
the study were to be replication 100 times, we would cor-
rectly reject the null hypothesis during 97­99% of those
replications. The effect of age was not significant for the
SOI--Attitude and SOI--Desire, F(1, 90) ¼ 0.05 and 1.31,
p ¼ .83 and .26, Z2
p
¼ 0.0005 and 0.01, respectively, but

Discussion
The results of the current research support the hypothesis
that women who have undergone FGC have a more
restricted sociosexual orientation than women who have not
undergone FGC. One of the major motivations for FGC is
to ensure that a woman will be uninterested in sexual rela-
tionships outside marriage (Skaine, 2005; WHO, 2014),
although most Igbo women seem to be unaware of this
(Adinma & Agbai, 1999). Studies demonstrating that
women who have undergone FGC have lower sexual satis-
faction provide some indirect evidence for this idea (Alsi-
biani & Rouzi, 2010; Andersson et al., 2012; Anis et al.,
2012; Berg & Denison, 2012; but see Ahmadu, 2007; Cat-
ania et al., 2007; Makhlouf Obermeyer, 2005), but no direct
test of this question has been made.
The current research is the first to document that a
woman's interest in engaging in a sexual relationship with
an extra-pair partner(s) is significantly inhibited by FGC. The
current research provides support for the previously hypothe-
sized motivations for FGC across cultures (Almroth et al.,
2001; WHO, 2014), including the Igbo community. From an
evolutionary perspective, FGC decreases men's paternity
uncertainty by restricting women's sociosexuality--including
women's desires to pursue extramarital relationships. Women
may obtain benefits from extra-pair matings (e.g., a higher
number of children: Scelza, 2011; food for children: Scelza,
2013; and offspring protection and survival: Hrdy, 2000).
FGC is costly to women and potentially beneficial to men,
indicating that the origin and maintenance of FGC is partially
attributable to sexual conflict over reproduction (Gorelik &
Shackelford, 2011).
Another possible cost of ``unrestricted sexuality'' is con-
tracting sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnan-
cies. These costs are exacerbated in rural conditions where
our research was carried out because women receive minimal
medical care (e.g., contraception and treatment for various
infections). Thus, FGC could be ancestrally motivated to
reduce mortality from infectious diseases and unwanted
pregnancies.
Our data suggest that FGC reduces the risk of female infi-
delity. More than 30% of Himba women living in Namibia,
for example, reported having had at least one extramarital
affair resulting in 17.6% of extra-pair children (Scelza,
2011), which are highest rates of extra-pair paternity than
have been recorded among small-scale societies (but see
Strassmann et al., 2012, for low rates [1.8%] of extra-pair
paternity in a traditional African population). Himba women
do not, however, undergo FGC (Brooke A. Scelza, personal
communication, March 6, 2015), which may at least partially
explain the high rates of their extra-pair behavior relative to
other similar small-scale societies. Unfortunately, genetic
data on extra-pair paternity in traditional societies are scarce
(Neel & Weiss, 1975; Strassmann et al., 2012), and so the
available data are likely insufficient for more rigorous tests
of nonpaternity rates among societies with FGC versus with-
out FGC.
For obvious ethical reasons, we did not employ an
experimental design for the current research. Consequently,
we cannot conclude that FGC per se directly causes the
restriction of sociosexuality. It is possible that girls who
undergo FGC--relative to those who do not undergo
FGC--received familial upbringings that more strongly
endorse female sexual fidelity. In other words, parents who
endorse their daughters receiving FGC also raise their
daughters to be more sexually restricted. Thus, a third vari-
able (e.g., familial upbringing) may mediate the relation-
ship between women who undergo FGC and their
sociosexuality. Future research should collect data on the
sociosexuality of parents to probe potential mediation
effects. Another limitation is that some factors beyond
FGC could account for some variance of the results. For
example, a survey in Egypt showed that females with FGC
are less educated and are less wealthy than those who did
not undergone FGC (El-Zanaty & Way, 2009). Women's
wealth is associated with higher degree of polyandry in
some traditional societies (Ardener, Ardener, & Warming-
ton, 1960), and wealthy women may have more sexual
opportunities due to enhanced attraction to males. Further
research needs necessarily to control for these potentially
confounding variables.
To conclude, FGC is a manifestation of sexual conflict
over reproduction. Practicing FGC may be considered an
extended phenotype of men's sexual proprietariness at
the expense of women's reproductive interests: It appears
that the practice of FGC restricts women's sociosexuality--
including their desire to commit sexual infidelity--
which may decrease men's paternal uncertainty. A deeper
understanding of the proximate mechanisms that inhibit
sociosexuality among women with FGC requires further
research.
