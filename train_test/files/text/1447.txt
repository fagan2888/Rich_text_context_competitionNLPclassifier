Nationally representative data on urinary levels of bisphenol A (BPA) and its metabolites in the United States from the 2005­2006 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to estimate daily BPA intakes. In addition, NHANES data on potential sources of BPA exposure
and personal characteristics were explored for their association with urinary BPA levels. On the basis of 2005­2006 NHANES urinary BPA data and
assumptions described in this paper, median daily intake for the overall population is approximately 34 ng/kg-day. Median daily BPA intakes for men are
statistically significantly higher than for women; there is a significant decrease in daily BPA intake with increasing age. Gender- and age-specific median
intakes differ from the overall population by less than a factor of 2. Although estimates of daily BPA intake have decreased compared with those from the
2003­2004 NHANES, it is premature to draw conclusions regarding trends at this time, as there is no indication that BPA use declined from 2003 to
2006. On the basis of an assessment of urinary BPA and questionnaire data from the 2005­2006 NHANES, consumption of soda, school lunches, and
meals prepared outside the home F but not bottled water or canned tuna F was statistically significantly associated with higher urinary BPA.

Introduction
Interest in both exposure pathways and toxicity of bisphenol
A (BPA) has grown in the past few years and a major effort
is underway by the US National Toxicology Program, the
Food and Drug Administration, and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate exposures to
BPA in infants and young children, to obtain the data for
constructing PBPK models, and to explore health conse-
quences associated with perinatal exposures to BPA (Bucher,
2009). Although an important exposure pathway is thought
to be from consumption of food and beverages packaged
in polycarbonate bottles and epoxy-lined cans, large-scale
studies on BPA levels in commonly consumed foods in the
United States have not yet been published and paired data on
dietary BPA intake and urinary BPA levels are needed.
Information on some potential sources of BPA exposure is
included in dietary questionnaire information obtained as
part of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). There are also urinary BPA data for
a portion of the NHANES participants. Thus, this cross-
sectional database can be used to evaluate whether
anticipated routes of dietary exposure are associated with
urinary BPA levels. Although the NHANES database is a
rich source of information on several possible BPA exposure
pathways, to date, associations between potential exposure
sources and urinary BPA levels from NHANES have not
been explored. Various studies have examined specific
products or activities for potential for human exposure to
BPA, including canned foods, microwave containers (Mar-
iscal-Arcas et al., 2009), soft drinks (Cao et al., 2009),
polycarbonate bottles including baby bottles (Vandenberg
et al., 2007; Carwile et al., 2009), smoking, alcohol
consumption (He et al., 2009), medical procedures/products
including cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis (Calafat
et al., 2009; FDA, 2009), dental sealants, and plastic tubing
(Vandenberg et al., 2007). Personal characteristics that have
been evaluated for their association with urinary BPA include
age, education level, gender (He et al., 2009), household
income (Becker et al., 2009), and body mass index (BMI)
(Ranjit et al., 2010).
There are now two time periods for which nationally
representative data on urinary BPA (CAS No. 80-05-7)
levels are available for the United States: the 2003­2004 and
2005­2006 NHANES data (Calafat et al., 2008; CDC,
2009). The sample population includes males and females

from ages 6 to 60 þ years. As excretion of ingested BPA into
urine, mainly as the glucuronide conjugate, is essentially
complete in 24 h, total urinary BPA in a 24-h urine sample
approximates the BPA intake from the previous 24 h (LaKind
and Naiman, 2008) (BPA in urine is present mainly as the
glucuronide conjugate; for the purposes of this paper, the sum
of the concentrations of BPA metabolites plus the parent
compound in urine is referred to as ``urinary BPA''). Thus, the
urinary BPA data can be used to estimate daily intakes of
BPA in the United States (LaKind and Naiman, 2008).
In this paper, we provide estimates of BPA daily intakes in
the United States based on the 2005­2006 NHANES data
and compare these with earlier published estimates from 2003
to 2004 (LaKind and Naiman, 2008). We then describe the
results of an exploration of the NHANES questionnaire and
examination data for statistical associations between possible
sources of exposure and personal characteristics and urinary
BPA levels. Of interest is whether the information available
in the NHANES database supports earlier published results
on likely exposure pathways. Therefore, we evaluated
associations between urinary BPA levels and items from the
NHANES questionnaire and examination data that specifi-
cally related to packaged food/drink consumption, smoking,
and specific medical procedures. We also assessed the
relationship between urinary BPA and age, gender, and
BMI as these have been described previously.
Methods
The CDC's National Center for Health Statistics data files
for NHANES 2005­2006 are available (CDC, 2009). The
BPA data are from a subsample of those individuals sampled
as part of NHANES (10,348 persons who participated in the
NHANES survey during 2005 and 2006). Total BPA, after
hydrolysis of conjugated metabolites, was measured in urine
for NHANES 2005­2006 (analyte designated as URXBPH
in the database with units of ng/ml). The method limit of
detection (LOD) is given as 0.4 ng/ml. In the data analyses,
measures below the detection limit were assigned a value of
the LOD divided by the square root of 2 (CDC, 2006a).
The total number of participants reported in the 2005­
2006 subsample is 2638; however, 90 of those individuals
had no data reported for BPA. Thus, the subsample for
which there are existing BPA data includes 2548 individuals.
Of that subsample, 182 of the measurements were below
the LOD. Selected percentiles for urinary BPA for the
sample population, and by gender and age, are shown in
Table 1.
Estimating BPA Daily Intake
The method used to estimate daily intake for individuals with
urinary BPA data from the 2005­2006 NHANES database
was described previously (LaKind and Naiman, 2008) and is
summarized here. For each individual in the NHANES
database with urinary BPA data, the urinary BPA concen-
tration (ng/ml) was combined with estimated 24-h urinary
output volume (ml) to determine daily excretion of BPA in
units of ng/day. This was assumed to be equivalent to the
daily intake. To obtain the daily intake adjusted for body
weight (expressed in units of ng/kg-day), the daily intake for
each individual was divided by that individual's body weight,
as reported in the 2005­2006 NHANES database (Eq. (1)).
Thirteen individuals were missing body weight data; the total
count of participants with all necessary data for estimating
daily BPA intake is 2535. To estimate various population
(and population subgroups) quantities such as intake means
or intake percentiles, weighted means and percentiles were
calculated using the NHANES 2-year weights provided by
CDC (as described in the NHANES analytic guidelines
(CDC, 2006b)).
Urinary BPA ðng=mlÞÂurinary output ðml=dayÞ=
body weight ðkgÞ ¼ ng BPA=kg day
ð1Þ
Using this approach, distributions of intakes representative
of the US population were determined for (i) all participants,
(ii) participants by the following age groups: 6­11, 12­19,
20­39, 40­59, and 60 þ years, and (iii) participants
by gender. The calculations of point estimates and confi-
dence intervals for the geometric mean intakes and intake
percentiles were carried out in the R platform (Ihaka and

Gentleman, 1996), using the Hmisc package (http://biostat.
mc.vanderbilt.edu/s/Hmisc). Confidence intervals for quan-
tiles were calculated using a weighted bootstrap method
described by LaKind et al. (2009).
As the NHANES data give information on urinary
concentrations, rather than intake, certain assumptions and
databases were relied on (LaKind and Naiman, 2008). First,
we used urinary BPA to represent daily intake as excretion of
ingested BPA (parent and metabolite) into urine is essentially
complete in 24 h (Dekant and Vo
¨ lkel, 2008). Weighting
factors provided by CDC were applied to the raw data,
resulting in estimates of percentiles and mean values that are
intended to be representative of the US population. Volume-
based urinary BPA data (ng/ml urine) were used because the
appropriateness of adjusting urinary BPA concentrations by
creatinine has been questioned (Mahalingaiah et al., 2008).
In our earlier analysis (LaKind and Naiman, 2008), we
generally found that within age groups F with the exception
of the 6­11-year olds F creatinine-adjusted intake estimates
tend to be lower than intake estimates based on non-adjusted
urinary BPA data and that intake estimates based on
creatinine-adjusted BPA concentrations and non-adjusted
concentrations are fairly highly correlated (correlation
coefficients ranging from 75% to 83%).
No 24-h urinary output data were collected for the
NHANES participants; we, therefore, used generic values
to describe typical urinary output based on age and gender to
estimate total daily excretion of BPA in ng (Valentin, 2002;
ICRP, 2003). For individuals from 20 years of age and older,
``adult'' ICRP values were used (male, 1600 ml/day; female,
1200 ml/day). For ages 12­19 years, the ICRP value for
15-year olds was used (1200 ml/day). For ages 6­11 years,
the average of the ICRP values for the 5-year olds (500 ml/
day) and 10-year olds (700 ml/day) was used.
Associations Between NHANES Questionnaire Data and
Urinary BPA Data
We reviewed the NHANES questionnaires to identify items
that have been previously described in the published literature
as possible BPA exposure pathways. We examined data
from the demographics, examination, and questionnaire files
located at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2005­2006/
nhanes05_06.htm.
As BPA is rapidly excreted, only questions that would
indicate regular BPA exposures were considered. Although
the most widely discussed exposure route is from consump-
tion of liquids stored in polycarbonate bottles, in particular
exposure to bottle-fed infants, no information specific to
these types of bottles was collected as part of the NHANES
survey nor were children under the age of 6 years included;
therefore, we could not evaluate this specific exposure route
or population. We focused on questionnaire data (from the
Food Frequency Questionnaire) related to diet (specifically
questions that included information on consumption of
canned, bottled, or packaged foods); we identified only one
question in the NHANES 2005­2006 examination variable
list that specifically related to consumption of canned food
(tuna). We also examined questions on alcohol consumption
and smoking. Alcohol as an exposure source of BPA (He
et al., 2009) may be related to storage and packaging of
alcohol. The basis for the reported association between
smoking and BPA exposure (He et al., 2009) is unclear; it is
possible that smoking is a surrogate for another behavior
correlated with BPA exposure. We were also interested in
items in NHANES that would provide information on
individuals undergoing medical procedures that could lead to
BPA exposures (Yamasaki et al., 2001). Only one question
related to this potential exposure route was identified:
whether the individual underwent dialysis. Finally, we
examined associations between urinary BPA and age, gender,
and BMI. The interested reader can link the variables used in
this analysis to the questionnaire component at the following
URL: http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/nhanes_05_06/
varexam_d.pdf.
The predictor variables investigated for association with
urinary BPA concentrations are of three types: categorical,
ordinal, or numerical. We used non-parametric methods so
that minimal assumptions would be made about the under-
lying distributions. For the ordinal and numerical predictor
variables, we performed two-sided tests of association based
on Spearman's rank correlation. In addition to being non-
parametric, this method allows for ordinal responses in which
meaningful numerical values cannot be assigned (i.e. for
questions that produce ranges of values). Standard asympto-
tic approximations to P-values may be inaccurate because of
the common occurrence of ties. In these instances, we used
permutation tests to calculate P-values: for each of 100,000
trials, the ordinal data were randomly permuted and a
Spearman's correlation was calculated between the permuted
values and the urinary BPA values. The P-value is taken to
be the proportion of these trials in which the obtained
Spearman's correlation was at least as extreme as the one
actually observed for the real data. For categorical data, we
used the Wilcoxon/Mann­Whitney rank sum test to
compare groups. As we are interested in associations between
a predictor variable and BPA urinary concentrations and
are not seeking results that are representative of the general
US population, for these analyses, we did not use the
CDC-weighting factors.

BPA Daily Intake
Percentiles and means were estimated for BPA daily intakes
from the 2005­2006 NHANES data based on individual
urinary BPA data and individual body weight data as
described in the previous section. Table 2 gives the results by

total population, age group (no data were reported
by NHANES for individuals under the age of 6 years),
and gender. Median BPA intakes are the highest for the
6­11-year age group, and intakes decline with increasing
age (6­11412­19420­39440­59460 þ ); intakes for
adults are statistically significantly less than those for children
in ages 6­11 years. Median BPA intakes are statistically
significantly higher for males compared with females.
Associations Between Urinary BPA and Dietary Exposure
and Personal/Demographic Data in NHANES
The results of the exploration of correlations between
NHANES questionnaire and examination data and urinary
BPA data are described below and summarized in Table 3.
Dietary Exposure We identified several questions specifically
related to consumption of canned food (tuna), bottled or
canned drinks (soda or bottled water) or food that may be
more likely to be packaged rather than fresh (school lunches or
meals obtained from outside the home). Given the short
physiologic half-life of BPA, we specifically targeted questions
that would be likely to give information on recent exposures.
Soda, bottled water, canned tuna, school lunches, meals
away from home There was a positive statistically significant
association between urinary BPA and consumption of
soda during non-summer months (P ¼ 0.0001) and summer
months (P ¼ 0.0004), number of school lunches per week
during the school year (P ¼ 0.002) and meals not prepared at
home (P ¼ 0.006). The association between soda consump-
tion and urinary BPA remained for those 18 years of age and
older and for those younger than 18 years. For consumption
of meals not prepared at home, separation of the population
by age (18 years and older or o18 years of age) reveals that
the relationship for adults remains significant (P ¼ 0.0002),
but for those under the age of 18 years, the relationship is no
longer significant (P ¼ 0.9). Consumption of canned tuna
was not correlated with urinary BPA; this lack of correlation
was observed for the whole population, for those younger
than 18 years of age, and for those 18 and older. For
consumption of bottled water, data from two successive
interview days were available; bottled water consumption
was inversely associated with urinary BPA only for the data
from the second interview.
Personal/Demographic Information Age was negatively
correlated with urinary BPA (Po0.00001) and females had
statistically significantly lower urinary BPA levels than males
(P ¼ 0.0002) (Table 1; Figure 1).
BMI was not correlated with urinary BPA (P ¼ 0.43).
Alcohol and cigarettes No association was observed between
alcohol consumption and urinary BPA levels. In general,
smoking seems to be inversely correlated with urinary BPA.
For example, individuals who reported being current smokers
had lower urinary BPA levels than non-smokers (P¼ 0.011).

In addition, the number of cigarettes smoked during the earlier
5 days was negatively correlated with urinary BPA (although the
association was not significant). However, we did not observe
a dose­response relationship between numbers of cigarettes
smoked per day and urinary BPA. Data were also available with
which to evaluate the association between urinary BPA and
when the participant last smoked (variable SMQ725). The
highest median level was for the group of participants who last
smoked the day before the questionnaire was administered
(2.7ng/ml) compared with those who smoked the day of the
interview (2.15ng/ml) and those who last smoked 3­5 days
before the interview (2.0ng/ml).
Medical procedures Only three individuals underwent
dialysis over the earlier 12 months and no information was
available on when the last procedure took place (although
a typical dialysis patient will undergo treatment three times
per week (National Kidney Foundation, 2009)). Two of
the participants' urinary BPA levels were around the 75th
percentiles for the general population (3.7 ng/ml) and one
was below the 25th percentile (0.5 ng/ml) (Table 1).
Race/ethnicity Mexican Americans had significantly lower
urinary BPA levels than Non-Hispanic Blacks; Non-Hispanic
Whites also had significantly lower urinary BPA levels than
Non-Hispanic Blacks (Wilcoxon test, Po0.00001).

intake for the overall population is approximately 34 ng/kg-
day. This is in close agreement with a recent estimate of BPA
intake from Germany (30 ng/kg; Vo
¨ lkel et al., 2008). Median
daily BPA intakes for men are statistically significantly higher
than for women and there is a significant decrease in daily
BPA intake with increasing age. However, gender- and
age-specific median intakes (ranging from approximately
25­50 ng/kg-day) differ from the overall population intake by
less than a factor of 2. The NHANES sample population did
not include children under the age of six, so no conclusions can
be drawn from these data regarding daily intakes for young
children. However, other studies that have reported levels of
urinary BPA in children have found that the youngest children
in the cohort have had the highest urinary BPA levels. For
example, in a study of 3­14-year olds in Germany (N ¼ 599),
the 3­5-year olds had highest levels (mean ¼ 3.55 mg/l) (Becker
et al., 2009). Similarly, Yamano et al. (2008) observed
a significant decrease in urinary BPA in 94 children over a
5-year time period from 1st to 6th grade. The estimate of
daily geometric mean intake for children given by Becker et al.
(2009) was 60ng/kg-day, comparable with our estimate of
54ng/kg-day for 6­11-year olds.
There are now two NHANES time periods with data on
urinary BPA (2003­2004 and 2005­2006). Daily BPA
intakes were previously reported by LaKind and Naiman
(2008) for the 2003­2004 data. Figure 1 shows the compa-
rison between daily intake of BPA from the 2003­2004
NHANES and the 2005­2006 NHANES. Although the
estimated daily intakes are lower for 2005­2006, it is
premature to draw any conclusions from these apparent
decreases; we were unable to locate information suggesting
that BPA use in the United States declined over the
2003­2006 time period and the negative public focus on
BPA began after this time period. Furthermore, results must
be interpreted with caution because of the limitations imposed
by the underlying data and the methodology for estimating
daily intake, especially those in the tails of the intake
distributions because of the small numbers of individuals
represented by those tails (LaKind and Naiman, 2008).
As noted earlier (LaKind and Naiman, 2008), the
controversy regarding conflicting interpretation of informa-
tion from studies of BPA endocrine and reproductive toxicity
is recognized. Existing health-based guidance values in the
United States and Europe can be compared with our esti-
mates of daily intakes. The European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA, 2007) and the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA, 2009) give a value of 50 mg/kg-day (50,000 ng/kg-day)
as the tolerable daily intake (TDI) and reference dose (RfD),
respectively. Median values were below 52 ng/kg-day for all
groups analyzed and the 95th percentiles were below 500 ng/
kg-day (Table 2). Thus, median and 95th percentile intake
estimates were approximately two to three orders of
magnitude below the current health-based guidance value.
This result is similar to that given by Ye et al. (2009) for a
cohort of Norwegian women, with the estimated average
daily intakes of BPA reported to be about three orders of
magnitude lower than the RfD and TDI.
Associations Between Urinary BPA and Diet, Lifestyle and
Personal Characteristics
Although dietary intake is thought to be the primary source
of exposure to BPA (Vandenberg et al., 2007), uncertainties
remain regarding relative contributions from various sources
of exposure. There are many uses of BPA for which related
potential exposures have not been fully assessed (e.g. digital
media, electrical and electronic equipment, automobiles, sports
safety equipment, electrical laminates for printed circuit
boards, composites, paints, and adhesives (http://www.
bisphenol-a.org/about/faq.html#b)). Much of the focus has
been on leaching of BPA from polycarbonate bottles into
beverages. In our analysis of the 2005­2006 NHANES
data, bottled water consumption was not associated with
increased urinary BPA, but no information on bottle type
(e.g. polycarbonate, polyethylene terephthalate [PET]) was
given. We observed an association between increased soda
consumption and urinary BPA. The questionnaire did not
distinguish between consumption from cans versus bottles.
Although soda bottles are generally comprised of PET and
are, therefore, unlikely to be a source of BPA exposure, cans
are typically coated with an epoxy resin from which BPA can
migrate (Cao et al., 2009). It is likely that some portion of
soda consumption reported in the NHANES study was from
cans; the association between soda consumption and urinary
BPA observed here is not unreasonable.
Reports of potential for BPA exposure from food
packaging, including carry-out food wrapping (Vandenberg
et al., 2007), cans and microwave containers (Mariscal-Arcas
et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009), and specifically canned tuna fish
(Mungui´a-Lo
´ pez et al., 2005), led us to focus on NHANES
questions related to consumption of food likely to come into
contact with these types of packaging. The only NHANES
question specifically related to a canned food item was for
canned tuna; however, despite the potential for migration
of BPA from the lining of can coatings into canned fish
(Mungui´a-Lo
´ pez et al., 2005), we did not observe an
association between more frequent canned tuna consumption
and higher urinary BPA. We assumed that school lunches
and meals prepared outside the home were more likely to
include canned or microwaved foodstuffs; greater consump-
tion of both of these meal types was associated with higher
urinary BPA. We did not have information on what
percentage of urine collection for school-age participants
was conducted during the school year and so could not assess
that part of the sample population in isolation, but the
association between urinary BPA and number of school
lunches consumed was still statistically significant.
We observed statistically significant inverse associations
between urinary BPA and age and household income.

In addition, men had higher urinary BPA levels than women;
median levels for men and women differed by approximately
14%. BMI was not correlated with urinary BPA.
In contrast with the results of He et al. (2009), we did not
observe a positive correlation between urinary BPA and
alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking. Insufficient
information was given on types of alcohol consumed or
how the alcohol was packaged to allow for a more detailed
analysis. As noted earlier, the rationale for the positive
correlation between cigarette smoking and BPA exposure
reported by He et al. (2009) is unclear; the NHANES data
did not yield an analogous result.
Data from cross-sectional studies such as NHANES are
most appropriately used for hypothesis-generating analyses
and become especially valuable when used in conjunction
with other supporting information (LaKind et al., 2008).
Information on associations must be interpreted with care
as cross-sectional studies do not, in and of themselves, give
sufficient information with which to determine causality. This
is especially the case for chemicals with short physiologic
half-lives and for which there are data from only one
sampling event (i.e. one biological specimen per study
participant). Thus, lack of an observed association between
a particular potential exposure route and urinary BPA levels
does not rule out such an exposure route. However, the
observation that certain behaviors are associated with urinary
BPA levels (e.g. consumption of school lunches and meals
outside the home) suggests that these exposure pathways
warrant further study. Our exploration into associations
between urinary BPA and questionnaire information in some
cases confirmed the results of earlier studies, and in other
cases contradicted those results. Additional confirmatory
research on potential exposure pathways and magnitude
of exposures F including a study design that involves
measurements of both urinary BPA and BPA levels in 24-h
diet F is needed.
