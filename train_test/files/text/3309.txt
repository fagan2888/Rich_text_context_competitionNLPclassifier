Schools play an important role in children's emotional, phys-
ical, and educational development (e.g., Kasen, Berenson,
Cohen, & Johnson, 2004; Khoury-Kassabri, Benbenishty, &
Astor, 2005; Roeser, Eccles, & Sameroff, 2000). Alongside
the family, schools can be considered a primary socialization
agent in the development of children. One of their main goals
is socialization to specific values, considered by the society
to be desirable (Halstead, 1996). It is therefore crucial to gain
a better understanding of the values prevalent in schools.
Surprisingly, however, no coherent typology exists that out-
lines the cultural dimensions of schools and allows research-
ers to study schools by their values. In this article, we address
this gap by providing a typology of school values, testing it
in three cultural contexts, and looking for meaningful rela-
tionships of school values with several additional variables.
Values are abstract trans-situational goals, varying in
importance, that pertain to desirable end-states or behaviors,
and guide selection or evaluation of behaviors and events
(Rokeach, 1973; Schwartz, 1992). Group values are implic-
itly or explicitly shared among group members. For example,
national and organizational cultures are distinguished by
their values, the ideas they hold about the right, wrong, and
the desirable in the group context (Hofstede, 1991; Schwartz,
1999, 2008). Cultural values are expressed in widely shared
norms, symbols, rituals, practices, and ways of thinking.
They are the vocabulary of socially approved goals used to
motivate action and to express and justify the preferred solu-
tions to societal problems (Schwartz, 1999, 2008).
We suggest that schools can be characterized by the val-
ues prevalent among their members, students, and teachers.
Moreover, schools differ in the values they stress. The dif-
ferential importance placed on values may be manifest
through school rules, teaching practices, relations among
teachers and students, and more. Describing a school by its
values can allow researchers to predict behaviors at schools,
and provide focused tools for intervention in case of school
malfunctioning.
In Study 1, we propose several potential value dimensions
that are likely to differentiate between schools. We test for
the existence and replication of these dimensions using
school-level value scores derived from the aggregated
responses of students in 32 Jewish and Arab schools from
Israel. We also relate these dimensions to several school-
level variables, such as school violence and ethnic school
system.
Group-level values are shared to some extent by most
members of the group (Schwartz, 1999). Although, for
example, there are likely to be average differences between
teachers and students, all school members are expected to
share their values to a large extent, because they belong to
the same social environment. In Study 2, we replicate the
value structure, and test the hypothesis that the values of
teachers, older students, and younger students across schools
are positively correlated in a third, Central European, cul-
tural context.

School Values Across Three Cultures: A
Typology and Interrelations
Ella Daniel1, Nadi Hofmann-Towfigh2, and Ariel Knafo3
Abstract
A new typology of school-level values is reported in three cultural contexts. School values were assessed by aggregating the
scores of 862 students, (ages 15-19) in 32 Jewish and Arab Israeli schools (Study 1), and 1,541 students (ages 11-21) from 8
European schools and 163 teachers from 6 of these schools (Study 2), using Schwartz's Portrait Values Questionnaire. Six
school values emerged in both studies: achievement, autonomy, egalitarianism, harmony, compliance, and dominance. The
importance of studying school-level values was demonstrated by relating the values of compliance and dominance to violence,
and harmony values to student support measures (Study 1). Strong (minimal r = .64) school-level correlations between
students of different ages and teachers supported the validity of the findings (Study 2).

Theoretical Background: School Values
As a Private Case of Group Values
Past research on school characteristics described schools
using a number of dimensions in the purpose of predicting
school outcomes and especially achievement. Among the
dimensions researched, one can find past abilities as well as
demographic characteristics, such as mean socioeconomic
status (SES) of the students' families and level of education
of parents (e.g., Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2001;
Raudenbush & Bryk, 1986). Other characteristics measured
are school climate, such as the social-emotional climate at
school (e.g., whether the school is characterized by enthusi-
asm or suspicion; Emmons, Efimba, & Hagopian, 1998;
Lehr & Christenson, 2002; Lynch, Lerner, & Leventhal,
2012; MacNeil, Prater, & Busch, 2009), communitarian
practices and beliefs (Phillips, 1997), cooperation among
staff, and the importance assigned to orderly atmosphere
(Opdenakker & Van Damme, 2001; Raudenbush & Bryk,
1986).
In the current research, we propose that a characterization
of schools based on the values they endorse will be useful for
differentiating between schools, and predicting norms and
behaviors in them. Research on school values can be under-
taken using a number of techniques, each holding advantages
and disadvantages. Values can be extracted from artifacts of
the schools, values of school principals and teachers, and
descriptions of the school values by the students (e.g.,
Feather, 1972; Meglino & Ravlin, 1998). We take a different
approach, relying on students or teachers as reporters of their
own values, and using the aggregated responses as indicators
of the priority given to each value at the school level (mean-
ingful within-school variations in values notwithstanding).
Our approach is based on the notion that school culture com-
prised the opinions, attitudes, and values of those inhabiting
the schools. The aggregation of individuals' values keeps in
check the individual variability, revealing the values com-
mon in the school.
Past studies found the aggregation of individual charac-
teristics a reliable, valid, and useful technique to measure the
cultural values of nations (Schwartz, 1999) as well as organi-
zations (Hofstede, Bond, & Luk, 1993). The values of the
individuals in organizations are a product of their shared cul-
ture as well as the unique personal experience. The variation
between individuals can express the uniqueness, while the
average priorities reflect the central thrust of the shared
enculturation. The variation between the aggregated scores is
largely independent of the variation at the individual level
leading to independent analyses and results (Hofstede et al.,
1993; Liska, 1990; Schwartz, 1999).
Although little theoretical work has been done regarding
the meaning of school values, there is extensive work about
values in other groups, particularly national cultures. We rely
on this work in defining school values. Similarly to national
values (Schwartz, 1999, 2008), school values are desirable
abstract goals that are shared to some extent by members of
the school community, such as students, teachers, and other
staff. Group values prescribe norms for individual members,
thus directing their behavior (Fischer, 2006; Schwartz,
1999). In schools in which prosocial values are considered
highly important, for example, school members are likely to
be encouraged to engage in mutual aid, and be responsible
for the welfare of others, through behaviors such as help in
doing school assignments.
Not all school members are likely to have the same impact
on school values. For example, school principals may be
more influential than the typical student or the typical
teacher. However, over time, the school community comes to
share values to a certain degree. This process occurs through
selection of like-minded members and socialization to value
preferences (De Cooman et al., 2009). The value preferences
of the school are conveyed to the members through everyday
experiences, such as the content and perceived difficulty
level of the learning tasks, the dominant patterns of interac-
tion among students and teachers, and the evaluation proce-
dures used (Boekaerts, de Koning, & Vedder, 2006). Thus,
school regulations and practices should reflect in part the
values of the schools. These regulations serve the purpose of
socializing new members to hold these values (e.g., Chatman,
1991).
The existence of shared school values does not preclude
individual differences within schools. For example, Ferrari,
Kapoor, and Cowman (2005) provided evidence that institu-
tional-level values of universities do not fully overlap with
students' personal value systems (see also Astill, Feather, &
Keeves, 2002; Owens, 2005). Thus, although normative
pressures are expected to increase adherence to school values
with time, there is still room for individual differences in the
extent these values are accepted by school members due to
their individual personalities or backgrounds. These within-
school differences in value priorities are reflected in within-
school individual differences in behavior, school
achievement, and well-being (Feather, 1992; Owens, 2005).
Content of School Values
In proposing a typology of school values, one may consider
the values of individuals (Schwartz, 1992) and the values of
national cultures (Schwartz, 2008) as possible reference
points. We see cultural values as a more relevant value typol-
ogy, as schools, like nations, are an assembly of individuals,
linked by common goals, practices, and norms. School val-
ues, like national values, can be seen as ideas about what is
right and wrong, desirable and undesirable, which are implic-
itly or explicitly shared among members of the group.
The cultural dimensions of values reflect the basic issues
or problems that societies confront to regulate their mem-
bers' actions. Schools face somewhat similar issues or prob-
lems to the ones confronted by nations, such as regulating the
nature of relations between the individual and the group. We
Daniel et al. 3
therefore choose to base the typology of school values on the
values of national cultures and not on the values of individu-
als. Nevertheless, schools also face issues and problems rel-
evant to their unique social role of teaching and socializing
children and adolescents, and we should therefore also con-
sider school-specific issues that may lead to value priorities.
Such issues are the questions of evaluating students and
emphasis on cognitive functioning. Hereinafter, we will
describe the school value dimensions hypothesized to be
similar to nations' value dimensions and the value dimen-
sions expected to be unique to schools.
Embeddedness Versus Autonomy
An important issue confronting societies is the nature of the
relations between the individual and the group. Particularly,
social entities differ markedly in the extent to which indi-
viduals are considered autonomous or embedded in their
groups (Hofstede, 1980; Markus & Kitayama, 1991;
Schwartz, 1999, 2008). Cultures differ in the importance
given to embeddedness (emphasizing group identification
and conforming to group norms and rules and the traditional
order) versus autonomy (viewing each person as an autono-
mous, bounded entity encouraged to pursue and express his
or her own uniqueness; Schwartz, 1999, 2008). These values
are also relevant to organizations, which differ in whether
they put an emphasis on interdependence, rules, and codes,
on one hand, or on independence and change, on the other
hand (Sagiv & Schwartz, 2000; Victor & Cullen, 1988).
Applied to schools, valuing rules at school has been found
relevant to variables such as parental school involvement
(Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002). Autonomy has also been
described as an important ethical principle distinguishing
between schools (Schulte et al., 2002). For example, some
schools may vary in their views about students' personal
responsibility for their academic success or failure. In sum,
we expected schools to differ in the importance given to
embeddedness and autonomy values.
Hierarchy Versus Egalitarianism
This second issue is especially relevant to schools because of
their hierarchical structures. Groups must find a way to guar-
antee responsible behavior that preserves the social fabric,
including cooperation and mutual consideration. In their
solution to this problem, societies are differentially posi-
tioned on the spectrum of values going from hierarchy (legit-
imizing an unequal distribution of power, roles, and
resources), on one end, and egalitarianism (an emphasis on
equality pursued through unselfish pursuit of others'welfare;
Schwartz, 1999), on the other. Hierarchical organizations
emphasize the chain of authority, in contrast to egalitarian
organizations, which assign flexible roles and enable nego-
tiation as means of motivating members (Sagiv & Schwartz,
2000). To ensure the smooth activity of the school, decisions
have to be made on whether to establish a hierarchical nature
of school organization, with teachers as more powerful and
students as compliant (and perhaps also with power differ-
ences between different students, such as older and younger
students), or whether students are considered equal to teach-
ers when important decisions are made. Indeed, Pang (1996)
found school differences in how much each school has a for-
malized, centralized, and well-established system of superor-
dinate­subordinate relationships.
Hierarchy values at schools were expected to focus on
humility and compliance, on one hand, and on dominance
and social power, on the other hand, because in a hierarchical
society it is important for members to acknowledge their
inferiority to some as well as their superiority to others
(Schwartz, 1999). For example, in hierarchical schools, older
students can give high importance to their higher status as
compared with younger students, but accept the higher status
ascribed to teachers.
Previous studies have also indicated that schools vary in
two aspects of egalitarianism as described by Schwartz
(1999, 2008). Differences in the importance ascribed to the
participation of teachers (Pang, 1996) and students (Harber
& Trafford, 1999; Vieno, Perkins, Smith, & Santinello, 2005)
reflect the egalitarian aspect of this value. The caring aspect
of egalitarianism is reflected in past studies indicating school
differences in the importance of collegiality and students'
mutual support (Doyle Lynch et al., 2012; Higgins-
D'Alessandro & Sadh, 1997; Pang, 1996; Rosenblatt &
Peled, 2002). In sum, we expected a dimension of school
values contrasting egalitarianism (and care) and hierarchy at
schools.
Mastery Versus Harmony
A third basic issue that cultures encounter concerns our rela-
tion their relations to the natural and social world. According
to Schwartz (1999), harmony values describe acceptance of
the world as it is, trying to fit in rather than change or exploit
it. Harmony values emphasize fitting harmoniously into the
environment (Schwartz, 1999). In organizations, this issue is
reflected in the level of competitiveness versus cooperation
(Sagiv & Schwartz, 2000). Harmony values may be impor-
tant to school functioning through the regulation of relation-
ships inside schools, and between the schools and their
communities. For example, in high-harmony schools, deci-
sions may be made through agreements rather than through a
voting procedure or simply principal-initiated regulations.
The opposite solution to the issue, mastery values, empha-
sizes getting ahead through active self-assertion, by respond-
ing to challenges, mastering, and changing the world (note
that despite the similar label, this concept is very different
than that of mastery goals, for example, Elliot & Church,
1997). Mastery values have two major aspects. One aspect
describes an emphasis on facing challenge and adventure. A
value representative of this aspect will be the value "daring."
4 SAGE Open
In the school context, this aspect may be of secondary impor-
tance. A second aspect of mastery values, the aspect of striv-
ing ahead and achieving, may be of supreme importance to
schools. Values representing this aspect may focus on ambi-
tion and success. Due to this differential relevance, we
decided to emphasize achievement as the defining feature of
mastery values in the school context.
Achievement
The role of individual students'achievement values has been
investigated substantially (Wigfield & Eccles, 1992, 2002).
Students'achievement goals were demonstrated to be impor-
tant for predicting success (Harackiewicz, Baron, Tauer,
Carter, & Elliot, 2000). Moving on to the school level, all
modern schools share the task of helping students reach a
certain standard in their studies. However, schools differ in
the relative importance given to achievement of this stan-
dard. This emphasis is expressed by multiple characteristics,
such as reinforcement and incentives for high academic stan-
dards (Pang, 1996), as well as physical plant, and teaching
methodology (Roeser, Urdan, & Stephens, 2009). Not only
do schools differ in the level of achievement value but they
also frame achievement differently. Schools can emphasize
learning, thus supporting effort and self-improvement. They
can also emphasize performance, thus encouraging demon-
stration of ability, comparison among students, and striving
for high grades as a main goal of learning (Anderman &
Midgley, 1997; Wang & Holcombe, 2010).
School culture of achievement has important contribu-
tions to student-level characteristics. School achievement
culture was found related to the motivation of students, their
identification with the school, and their engagement in the
school; to students' self-esteem; to self-regulation strategies;
and finally, to the achievement of students (Church, Elliot, &
Gable, 2001; Wang & Holcombe, 2010). Being such an
important characteristic shaping the everyday lives of stu-
dents at schools, we expected to find achievement values to
be a defining feature of mastery values, differentiating
among schools in a substantive manner in our study.
The Structure of Value Types
The value types suggested above are hypothesized to form
dimensions that express the conflicts between alternative
resolutions to issues faced by schools. Because of these con-
tradictions, we expect an emphasis on a value to go along
with a de-emphasis of the opposing type. At the same time,
compatibilities are possible between values from different
dimensions. That is, certain value emphases are likely to be
accompanied by other value emphases, to the extent they
share similar assumptions and motivations. These relations
of conflicts and compatibilities are summarized in the circu-
lar structure formed by the school value system. For exam-
ple, egalitarianism values and autonomy values share the
assumption that people can and should be held responsible
for their actions and decisions. Embeddedness and hierarchy
values share the assumption that each individual has group
obligations and roles that may override personal inclinations
(Schwartz, 2008). We expected school values to follow the
pattern of conflicts and compatibilities described at the cul-
tural level.
In conclusion, we hypothesized that schools differ across
three value dimensions relevant to groups in general: hierar-
chy versus egalitarianism, embeddedness versus autonomy,
and harmony versus mastery. We hypothesized that mastery
values will take the form of achievement values. Moreover,
we expected the structure of the values at the school level to
resemble the structure of group values. Last, we hypothe-
sized that the school values found will be able to predict
school-level characteristics. We addressed these issues in
Study 1.
Study 1
Study 1 investigated the structure of values at the school
level in Israeli Jewish and Arab high schools. In Israel,
Jewish and Arab students study in different school systems,
both under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.
The structure of the curriculum in both school system is
nearly identical. It differs mainly in the cultural and reli-
gious subjects, and in the language of instruction (Benavot
& Resh, 2003). The students in the Jewish schools are mem-
bers of the Jewish majority in Israel. This group comprises
79% of the Israeli population. The students in the Arab
schools are Arab citizens of Israel. Their families are likely
to have lived in the area that is now Israel since before its
foundation. They are approximately 18% of the Israeli pop-
ulation, and belong to two main religions, Islam and
Christianity. They live mostly in homogeneous Arab vil-
lages or segregated neighborhoods in mixed cities
(Rabinowitz, 2001). Israeli Jews were previously found to
report higher importance assigned to values of autonomy
and mastery than Israeli Arabs, while Israeli Arabs reported
higher importance assigned to values of hierarchy and
embeddedness than Israeli Jews (Schwartz, 2008).
Value structure was analyzed using multidimensional
scaling (MDS) as recommended by Schwartz (1999;
Schwartz & Sagiv, 1995). Schwartz (1992) considered value
types as fuzzy sets arrayed on a continuum of related empha-
ses. Value items are grouped into value domains based on
theoretical considerations and the empirical location of
items, where items emerging adjacent in the value structure
are considered to share similar meanings and to point to a
shared emphasis (Schwartz, 1992). Replication of the struc-
ture across sample types and cultures provides the best evi-
dence for the validity of a value theory (e.g., Schwartz &
Sagiv, 1995). We measured school values by aggregating
responses across individuals attending the same school, as
explained earlier.
Daniel et al. 5
Our first question was whether meaningful value dimen-
sions could be found that may distinguish between schools.
We addressed this issue with data from a substantial number
of schools (N = 32). The second question addressed the issue
of replicability of the value dimensions found. We compared
the school-level value structure in two ethnic cultures by
comparing Arab and Jewish schools in Israel. Next, we
addressed the relevance of the value dimensions by asking
whether the value dimensions were meaningful for compar-
ing schools of different ethnic backgrounds in their value
priorities, and for studying the relationships between school-
level values and several social characteristics of schools
(violence levels and school treatment of students).
Meaningful relationships would exemplify the usefulness of
the value dimensions in understanding between-school dif-
ferences in other variables.
Method
Participants. High school students (N = 907) attending 33 dif-
ferent schools participated in the study. Of the participants,
3% could not be assigned to a school or attended a school
with less than 15 participants in the sample, and were there-
fore not included in the analysis. The final sample included
15 Jewish and 17 Arab schools with 862 students or 28 stu-
dents on average in each school. Adolescents' ages ranged
from 15 to 19 with 95% between 16 and 18 (M
Jews
= 16.72,
SD = 0.80; M
Arabs
= 16.91, SD = 0.70). About half (49%) of
the respondents were female (49% among Jewish adoles-
cents, 50% among Arab adolescents). Arab adolescents were
51% of the sample (20% of the age-relevant population in
the country; Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, 2005) to
ensure an adequate sample size for cross-cultural
comparisons.
Procedure.Schools were randomly sampled in each sector
across different levels of SES, as classified by the Israeli
Ministry of Education. An attempt was made to reach about
equal numbers of schools from the lower, middle, and upper
range of socioeconomic development. This resulted in 34%
of the schools being from the top three deciles of socioeco-
nomic development relative to schools of the same ethnic
group, 36% from the middle three deciles, and 27% from the
lower four deciles. This distribution did not differ signifi-
cantly between Arab and Jewish schools, 2(2) = 1.14, ns,
meaning that schools similarly represented socioeconomic
variation within each ethnic group. Nevertheless, it is impor-
tant to note there were between-group differences in SES.
For example, the mean parental education level in Jewish
schools was 13.13 years (SD = 1.44) as compared with Arab
schools (M = 11.55, SD = 1.27), t(30) = 3.30, p < .01. Only
schools in which at least 15 students participated were
retained for school-level analysis.
Adolescents were recruited by telephone during 2005.
Each ethnic group was reached in a procedure that was more
likely to yield a relatively high participation rate within that
group. Adolescents attending Jewish schools were
approached through phone numbers taken from student
directories for high schools. Classes were randomly sampled
from within the school, and all students who were listed for
the specific class were approached, and requested to partici-
pate. Adolescents attending Arab schools, for which no
equivalent phonebooks existed, were approached with the
use of a snowball technique.
A university student of the relevant ethnic group adminis-
tered the questionnaire in the adolescents' homes to the ado-
lescents who agreed to participate (46%) and received
parental permission to do so. A small (7%) proportion of the
sample (n = 62 Jewish adolescents) answered the question-
naire on a secure website. No significant differences on any
of the study variables were found between adolescents who
answered a paper­pencil questionnaire and those who
responded on the Internet. Adolescents were assured that
their responses would be anonymous and confidential. They
were instructed to answer the questionnaires alone, without
parental intervention or the presence of peers, and were
offered to hand the questionnaires back in sealed envelopes.
Materials.
The questionnaires contained several parts,
regarding adolescents' values, perception of school charac-
teristics, violent victimization, and violent behavior. Each
respondent completed the questionnaire in his or her native
language (Hebrew or Arabic). Back-translation procedures
ensured the comparability of the Arabic and Hebrew
questionnaires.
Values.
Values were assessed with the Portrait Val-
ues Questionnaire (PVQ; Schwartz et al., 2001; Schwartz,
Lehmann, & Roccas, 1999). We used a version tested by
Schwartz and Rubel (2005) in a multicultural study. The
PVQ has been shown to be suitable for use with adolescents
(Bubeck & Bilsky, 2004; Knafo & Schwartz, 2003; Knafo &
Spinath, 2011; Schwartz et al., 2001). It includes short ver-
bal portraits of 40 people (matched to the respondent's gen-
der). Each portrait describes the person's goals, aspirations,
or wishes, pointing implicitly to the importance of a single
broad value. Two exemplary portraits are as follows: "It is
important to her to be rich. She wants to have a lot of money
and expensive things" and "It is important to him always to
behave properly. He wants to avoid doing anything people
would say is wrong." Respondents indicated "How much
like you is this person?" for each portrait, using a 6-point
scale ranging from "very much like me" to "not like me at
all." Thus, respondents' own values were inferred from their
self-reported similarity to people who are described in terms
of particular values.
As a preliminary analysis, we ensured that Jewish and
Arab adolescents understood the value items in a similar
way. We conducted smallest space analyses (SSA; Guttman,
1968) in which the values of Jewish and Arab adolescents
6 SAGE Open
yielded structures very similar to the prototypical, circular
structure of values described by Schwartz (1992). This anal-
ysis indicated that Jewish and Arab adolescents construed
their values at the individual level very similarly. Three items
were located in different areas of the structure for both
groups (country safety, stable government, fit into nature).
These items were omitted from the school-level analyses to
preserve the cross-cultural equivalence of value meaning.
To control for scale use differences across cultures that
are independent of value structures (Fischer, 2004; Schwartz,
1992), we standardized each value item within individual, so
that each individual student's responses reflected the impor-
tance he or she gave to that item relatively to all value items.
We then averaged the standardized scores of all students
available from each school to form an aggregated school-
level item score. We performed all further analyses on these
transformed data.
School violence.This measure was adapted from Benben-
ishty, Zeira, and Astor (2000) by selecting eight items (from a
larger pool) that measured direct violent behavior, in different
levels of severity, and by asking adolescents not only to report
on violent behaviors they were victims of, as in the original
version, but also on their own behavior and the behavior of
their best two friends. Every student was asked about the fre-
quency of his or her own violent behavior (e.g., picked up a
stone or another object to hurt another student; took things
from another student by use of force), about the frequency
in which he or she was a victim of another student's vio-
lent behavior, and finally about the frequency of his or her
two best friends' violent behavior over the last 12 months.
Answers were given on a 3-point scale (0 = never, 1 = once
or twice, 2 = 3 times or more). A total score was calculated by
summing responses across all items of each scale, with higher
scores indicating more frequent violence. We then aggregated
the scores on each of the three variables across all respon-
dents from each school, creating three scores (perpetration,
victimization, and friends' behavior) for the violence level in
that school. The violence variables, like the school values,
were therefore created as characteristics of schools, and not
of individuals. They describe the level of violence prevalent
in this school and encountered by the students studying in it,
whether they take part in it themselves or not.
School climate.We assessed school climate with a scale
of nine items taken from scales by Benbenishty et al. (2000).
In the present study, the scale consisted of two subscales.
One subscale focused on students' participation in school
decision-making processes (e.g., "Our school staff makes an
effort to enable students' participation in making important
decisions"). The other one assessed teachers' support (e.g.,
"When I have a problem, I feel comfortable discussing it
with my teachers"). Respondents indicated how much they
agreed with each of eight statements on a scale, ranging from
1 = disagree to 5 = agree. Items were then aggregated within
schools. Again, school climate was a characteristic of the
school as all respondents reported of it, and not of the sub-
jective perspective of any individual student.
Results
Identifying School-Level Value Dimensions. We ran a series of
consecutive MDS analyses on the school-level value scores.
We used the alternating least-squares algorithm (ALSCAL)
procedure in SPSS 20, adding no initial configuration. ALS-
CAL differs from other MDS procedures in minimizing
S-Stress rather than Stress, thereby fitting squared distances
to squared similarities (Borg & Groenen, 2010). Because of
the large number of items and the relatively small number of
schools, we were interested in reducing the number of items
to include only those that could robustly and meaningfully
address variation across schools.
Our first criterion was cross-cultural similarity in mean-
ing. We dropped PVQ Items 14, 35, 40,1 which were not
shown to have a cross-culturally similar meaning at the indi-
vidual level in preliminary analyses (Knafo, Daniel, &
Khoury-Kassabri, 2008). We also dropped Item 20 that per-
tains to the importance of religion, because the educational
system in Israel is highly segregated based on religiosity
level (e.g., there are Jewish religious and Jewish nonreli-
gious schools), and the meaning of this item may be different
across these school systems.
Our second criterion was face validity and content mean-
ingfulness of the groups of items. We attempted to find
meaningful regions in the school-level MDS analysis. A
number of items were positioned in the proximity of items
that were not conceptually related to them. For example, the
three individual-level Schwartz (1992) hedonism values
were dispersed in the school-level value structure and did not
relate in an internally valid way to the items in their vicinity.
Possibly, hedonism has little meaning as a school-level
value. Six more items from diverse Schwartz (1992) value
types (4, 15, 25, 28, 31, 36) did not show theoretically mean-
ingful relations to the items in the regions they appeared in.
Such items were therefore dropped from further analysis. We
ended up with 27 items that had cross-cultural meaning
equivalence and formed meaningful clusters of at least 3
items each, with Stress 1 value of .03, which represents an
excellent representation (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). Figure 1
presents the final MDS structure.
The first dimension we described in our theoretical back-
ground referred to embeddedness versus autonomy. A clear
autonomy region emerged (Figure 1, middle right) with six
items ( = .70), emphasizing openness to intellectual experi-
ences and behavioral choice. Potential embeddedness items
such as secure surroundings, cleanliness, and behaving prop-
erly appeared at the opposite end of the figure, but did not
form a clear embeddedness region.
As expected, a region emerged that included both aspects
of hierarchy values, namely, humility and compliance, on
Daniel et al. 7
one hand, and dominance and social power, on the other
hand (Figure 1, top left). However, in contrast to the expec-
tations, a clear distinction also emerged between these two
aspects, in this study as well as in Study 2. The values of
compliance formed a distinct group, relating to issues of
obedience and acceptance of one's place in the social world.
The values of dominance formed another group, relating to
issues of authority and command. We therefore retained
two separate values. Dominance values (Figure 1, top left)
included three items ( = .68), emphasizing being at the top
of the social hierarchy: being rich, being in charge, and
leading. Compliance values (Figure 1, middle left) included
three items ( = .50), emphasizing accepting one's position
when at the lower end of the social hierarchy (being humble
and modest, behaving properly, doing as told, and follow-
ing rules).
We also expected to find a region of values emphasiz-
ing the importance of egalitarianism. This region was
found (Figure 1, top right). This value included seven
items ( = .80), emphasizing broadmindedness and equal-
ity, protection of the weak, forgiveness, loyalty, and sup-
porting and helping others.
A harmony region was also found (Figure 1, bottom
left) with five value items ( = .77). As suggested by
Schwartz (1999) regarding national cultures, harmony val-
ues emphasize both harmony with the surrounding physi-
cal environment (cleanliness, caring for nature) and social
harmony (secure surroundings, being satisfied with less,
and world peace).
Finally, as was theoretically postulated, a clear achieve-
ment region emerged (Figure 1, bottom right) with three
items ( = .69), emphasizing ambition, getting ahead, and
succeeding and impressing others. This value is very similar
to the individual-level achievement value described by
Schwartz (1992). Table 1 presents the definitions of the six
values we identified.
The order of the values emerging from the analysis was as
follows: dominance, compliance, harmony, achievement,
autonomy, and egalitarianism. Thus, harmony values were
located in a position different than hypothesized, alongside
the opposing achievement values, resulting in shifts in the
structure.
Cross-Culturally Replicating the School-LevelValue Structure.We
next asked whether the structure obtained would replicate in
the two cultural groups. We averaged the items belonging to
each value domain to scores representing the six school-level
values and ran the analysis separately for Jewish and Arab
schools. (We used average scores to reduce the number of
items in an MDS based on less than 20 schools.) The ALS-
CAL procedure yielded Stress 1 values smaller than .01 for
Jews and Arabs. As Figure 2 shows, the structure was similar
for the two groups, with the values similarly ordered (going
from the bottom left, clockwise): dominance, compliance,
harmony, egalitarianism, autonomy, and achievement. This
cross-cultural replication supports the validity of our find-
ings, and enables a mean comparison of the importance of
the six school values in each group. Moreover, when sepa-
rated across cultures, harmony values were located in the
hypothesized position, between the values of compliance and
egalitarianism, and in opposition to the values of
achievement.
Cross-Cultural Differences in Value Importance.The value
dimensions that characterize Jewish and Arab schools were
found similar in structure. Thus, schools from both cultures
can be distinguished based on the same value dimensions.
We tried to examine the relevance of the six values derived in
this study by demonstrating their ability to distinguish
between schools coming from the separate ethnic cultures. If

Value Definition
Dominance Striving for reaching the top of the social
hierarchy; being rich, being in charge, and
leading.
Compliance Accepting one's position and obligations toward
the social system and toward the upper end
of the social hierarchy; being humble, modest,
and obedient.
Harmony Aspiring for harmony with the surrounding
physical and social environments; avoiding
conflict, danger, and disorder.
Egalitarianism The importance of caring for others and respect
for them; broadmindedness and equality,
protection of the weak, loyalty, and helping.
Autonomy Openness to intellectual experiences and the
importance of behavioral choice.
Achievement Motivation for striving ambitiously to get ahead,
succeeding and impressing others.

ethnic culture has an effect on the values prevalent in the
schools, then the schools originating from different cultures
will support different values.
We compared the mean importance given to values in
Arab and Jewish schools. Large and significant differences
were found in all values (Table 2). Even the smallest effect
size (D = 0.77 for dominance) is considered large in Cohen's
(1992) terms. In Jewish schools, there was higher impor-
tance to dominance, egalitarianism, and autonomy values,
whereas in Arab schools higher importance was given to
compliance, harmony, and achievement. Thus, school values
were successful in differentiating between schools coming
from different cultures.
Relating School-LevelValues to Other School Characteristics.The
school-level value scores of each school in each value were
correlated with school-level characteristics of these schools,
including the climate in the school and the level of violence
prevalent in it. Harmony values, that emphasize smooth
interpersonal relations, correlated meaningfully with the rat-
ings of students of the support they received from teachers, r
= .50, p < .01, and with the ratings of students' participation
in decision making, r = .43, p < .01, controlling for ethnic
differences.
Next, we related school-level values to school violence.
An unexpected finding emerged with achievement values
correlating positively (controlling for ethnic differences)
with school violence as indicated by adolescents' reports of
perpetration, r = .52, p < .01; the violence of their two best
friends, r = .52, p < .01; and reports of victimization, r = .40,
p < .05.
We were interested in the potential predictive power of
compliance and dominance. Although neither of these values
correlated with school violence, we reasoned that their com-
bination may predict violence. Specifically, a school in
which compliance values are not important and at the same
time dominance is very important is likely to have the high-
est degree of violence, because individuals in this context
will strive to obtain power and control over others (high
dominance) with little regard for rules, norms, and laws (low
compliance). We ranked schools as either high or low in
these two values, based on them being, respectively, above or
below the median of schools of the same ethnic sector. We
then ran a MANCOVA with ethnic school system as the
covariate.
Figure 3 presents the mean violence levels (using the
three indices of violence) for schools high or low in compli-
ance and dominance. The multivariate test showed that nei-
ther compliance, F(3, 25) = 0.53, ns, nor dominance, F(3, 25)
= 1.25, ns, had a significant main effect on school violence.
However, the two values interacted in predicting violence
levels, F(3, 25) = 5.66, p < .01. Schools in which dominance
values were high in importance but compliance values low
stood out as highest in violence, regardless of whether it was
indexed by adolescents' reports of perpetration, F(1, 27) =
4.74, p < .05, 2 (variance accounted for) = .10; by reports
about the violence of two best friends, F(1, 27) = 11.98, p <
.01, 2 = .25; or by reports of victimization, F(1, 27) = 4.76,
p < .05, 2 = .14.
Discussion
The study found meaningful clusters of values at the school
level. These values were mostly similar to the nation-level

values identified in previous research (Schwartz, 1999,
2008): dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitarianism,
autonomy, and achievement. The values of embeddedness
were not distinguished as a meaningful value at the school
level. The order of the values at the culture level, but not at
the overall level, resembled the hypothesized structure. The
difference may stem from the high importance assigned by
Arab adolescents, relative to Jewish adolescents, to both har-
mony and achievement values, resulting in high correlation
between the values at the school level. The cross-cultural
similarity in the value structure supports the validity of the
results. The meaningful relationships with other variables
such as teacher support and school violence suggest that
these values may be important variables to be pursued in fur-
ther research.
However, the first study had two main weaknesses. First,
we relied on data from a limited number of students within
each school to characterize the whole school. Moreover, the
sampling of the adolescents within each school was not ran-
dom, particularly in the Arab sample. Although more than
800 students participated and every data point is based on at
least 15 students, it would be preferable to see whether the
results could be replicated with larger samples.
Second, although the Arab and Jewish school systems in
Israel are different in many respects, they are still nested
within the same context, and managed by the same Ministry
of Education. A replication in a different cultural and educa-
tional context is therefore needed.
Most importantly, we have assumed that aggregated stu-
dents' values could represent the values of the school.
However, teachers influence school culture to a large extent,
and they may have substantially different values. A study
with data from students and teachers is needed to see whether
the value priorities of the schools are shared by teachers and
students, and to check for mean-level differences between
these two school subpopulations.
Study 2
In Study 2, our first question was whether the value typology
and structure found would be replicated within schools
nested in a European context. Our second question dealt with
whether Study 1 results were unique to student reports. We
addressed it with data from students and teachers, using a
large number of students in each school. A replication of the
value structure provided by student and teacher data would
provide support for the proposed value dimensions.
The third question dealt with a different kind of replica-
tion. Not only did we look at the structure of values for stu-
dents and teachers but we also looked at whether the values
of each specific school were similar, regardless of whether
they were measured with student data or with teacher data. In
other words, we expected the meaningful school value
dimensions to be reflected in substantial positive correlations
between the school-level values of students and teachers,
reflecting the unique culture of the school.
Similarly, we wanted to compare the value priorities of
younger and older students, and to see whether the same val-
ues are shared by school members of different ages. High
positive correlations across schools between the importance
given to each value by younger and older students would
support the validity of our findings.
Method
Participants.The study was conducted with students (5th-
13th grade, N = 1,541: 695 girls, 845 boys, and 1 unknown)
from eight different high schools in central Europe (six Ger-
man schools, one international school in Germany, and one
international school in the Czech Republic). Students' age
range was between 11 and 21 years (M = 15.61, SD = 1.99)
with 93% between the ages of 12 and 18. The majority (72%)
of the students were Germans, 28% were of other nationali-
ties. In addition, teachers from six of these schools (n = 163:
82 females, 78 males, and 3 unknown) participated as well.
Teachers' ages ranged from 21 to 71 years (M = 42.48, SD =
10.12) with 95% between the ages of 26 and 65.
Procedure. The eight schools were located by sending letters
to approximately 35 high schools asking the principals
whether they would be willing to allow their students to par-
ticipate in the study. Depending on the requirements of each
school, in some of the schools, we administered the question-
naires class by class; in others, they were handed out and
filled in during school assembly time. Teachers' question-
naires were administered when permission was granted (six
schools).

Materials. As in Study 1, all participants filled in a question-
naire which, in addition to basic variables such as sex and
age, measured their values using the PVQ (Schwartz et al.,
1999, 2001). An individual-level MDS showed that the value
items measured the 10 Schwartz (1992) values, enabling a
cross-cultural replication for the purposes of this study. The
same standardization procedures as in Study 1 were used. We
then averaged the scores of all students available from each
school to form an aggregated school-level score. Similarly,
in the six schools in which teacher data were available, we
aggregated teachers' scores. We performed all analyses on
these transformed and aggregated data.
Results
Replication of the School-Level Value Structure Using Student
Data. We ran an MDS on the school-level scores, using the
ALSCAL procedure, with students' data across eight schools,
and the same 27 items identified in Study 1. Figure 4 pres-
ents the structure obtained in this MDS. The structure from
the European schools replicated almost perfectly the Israeli
structure, and the stress was .03 that represents an excellent
representation (Kruskal & Wish, 1978). For five of the six
values, all items clustered together as in Study 1 (Figure 1).
One minor exception was the location of harmony values,
which were located in front of compliance values, instead of
beside it, as in the separate cultures in Israel. In spite of this
relatively small deviation, and considering the small number
of schools (n = 8), Study 2 provides a very good replication
of Study 1's results. This assertion is based on the standards
provided by Schwartz and Sagiv (1995) for cross-cultural
comparison of value structures.
Replicating the Value Structure with Teacher Data.We next
asked whether the structure obtained would replicate using
teacher and student samples. We averaged the items belong-
ing to each value domain to scores representing the six val-
ues and ran an ALSCAL analysis, as described before,
separately for students across eight schools and for teachers
in six schools (Stress 1 = .03 for students and .05 for teach-
ers). Plotting the resulting structure in Figure 5, the structure
was very similar for the two groups, with the values similarly
ordered (going from the middle left, clockwise): dominance,
compliance, harmony, egalitarianism, autonomy, and
achievement. The similar structure for teachers and students
provides further support to the school value classification we
propose. In addition, the structure is very similar to the one
found in the analysis of the two separate Israeli samples,
which provides a second cross-cultural replication.
Consistency of School Values across Student Age Groups and
between Students and Teachers.The large student samples
obtained within each school enabled us to test the issue of
replicability of the findings with different age groups
attending the same school. If school values, as argued, are
common to some extent to most school members (allowing
for individual differences), then the value priorities of
teachers as well as younger (ages 11-15) and older (ages
16-20) students within the same school should correlate
positively and significantly. In other words, when aggre-
gated school-level scores taken from teachers and students
of different ages correlate positively, this provides evidence
for meaningful cross-schools variability that is shared by
school members, be they older students, younger students,
or teachers. We tested this hypothesis using cross-schools
correlations for each value between the priorities given to it
by younger and older students, aggregated within each
school. The hypothesis was supported by the school-level

means, European student data.

correlations presented in Table 3. Positive correlations were
found for all six values (although the correlation for har-
mony was not significant, r = .32).
A further test of our findings was whether teachers and
students at each school have similar values. In other words,
if the value priorities of teachers and students in the same
school correlate highly positively, this would indicate that
school values as conceptualized and measured here do repre-
sent the values of each school, regardless of whether they
have been obtained with teacher or student data. Moreover, it
would support the idea that school values are a construct rel-
evant to school members of different ranks. This is the case,
as demonstrated by school-level correlations of each value
across the six schools between students and teachers (Table
3). Across schools, teachers' and students' aggregated values
correlated strongly (minimal r = .76, maximal r = .96). The
correlations between teachers' scores and students' scores
were somewhat higher for the older students (average r =
.85) than for the younger students (average r = .75).
Interestingly, although students' and teachers' compliance
values correlated very highly (r = .96, p < .01) across schools,
teachers still valued compliance (M = -0.30, SD = 0.48)
more than students did (M = -0.62, SD = 0.26), t(5) = 3.23, p
< .05, D = 0.86.
Discussion
Although the number of schools in Study 2 was relatively
small, the number of individual students in each school was
large (192.6 on average), and thus school values could be
measured reliably. The results of Study 2 replicated the value
typology and structure found in Study 1 and extended them
to a third cultural context. Furthermore, the results showed
that school values as assessed here are common to different
school subpopulations: teachers, older students, and younger
students.
General Discussion
This study proposes and tests a typology of school-level val-
ues. Results from three cultural contexts all point to the
existence of the same six values. MDS analyses of the value
scores find that the order of the values is consistent across
value domains: dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitari-
anism, autonomy, and achievement. In Germany, the sub-
stantial correlations between students of different ages and
teachers in Study 2 supported the validity of the findings, and
the behavioral correlates of values (school violence, support
for students, and participation in decision making) demon-
strated the importance of studying school-level values as a
potential precursor of other school characteristics.
School-Level Value Content
Schools are groups of individuals that work together to pro-
mote group and individual goals. We therefore expected
schools to differ across the three value dimensions that define
the solutions which groups in general give to three issues:
embeddedness versus autonomy, hierarchy versus egalitari-
anism, and harmony versus mastery (Schwartz, 1999, 2008).
This expectation was partly supported, as each of the
three issues was represented in the school-level values we
identified--autonomy, dominance and compliance (repre-
senting hierarchy), egalitarianism and harmony. However,
the value of embeddedness, which distinguishes among
national cultures, did not emerge as important in distinguish-
ing among schools; and mastery values took a unique form
of achievement values when distinguishing among schools.
We will next discuss the similarities and differences between
the national-level and the school-level value dimensions.
The embeddedness-autonomy dimension is represented
by autonomy values in this study, promoting openness to
intellectual experiences and the importance of behavioral
choice. Thus, schools differ in how much they consider it
important that individuals are autonomous (see also
Schulte et al., 2002). One way further investigations of this
value could go is to study the tightness versus looseness
(Gelfand et al., 2011) of rules and codes at schools. For
example, it is possible that in high-autonomy schools, the
dress code of students (and teachers) will be more flexible
than in low-autonomy schools. In these schools, parental
school involvement (Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002) may also

be higher than in schools in which autonomy is not highly
important. These schools can also stress students' curiosity
and personal responsibility for studies more than other
schools (Cheng, 2011).
It is interesting to note that a clear embeddedness region
had not emerged in any of the studies. Embedded cultures are
those that expect meaning in life to come largely through
social relationships, through identifying with the group, par-
ticipating in its shared way of life, and striving toward its
shared goals. It is possible that the importance of embedded-
ness values is largely derived from the national or ethnic cul-
ture, or from the family system, and schools do not create
their unique atmosphere of embeddedness. Thus, schools
cannot be distinguished by their embeddedness values.
The hierarchy-egalitarianism dimension is represented
by dominance values, that emphasize striving to reach the
top of the social ladder, and compliance values, that empha-
size acceptance of one's role in the social hierarchy system.
In high-dominance schools, a more differentiated status sys-
tem is expected as compared with low-dominance schools.
Schools that have a relatively formalized, centralized, and
well-established system of superordinate­subordinate rela-
tionships (Pang, 1996), for example, between teachers and
students or between older and younger students, are likely to
be those in which dominance values are relatively impor-
tant. In high-compliance schools, acceptance of the rules
and following them are likely to be emphasized. The inter-
action between compliance and dominance values in pre-
dicting school violence emphasizes also the importance of
studying the joint contributions of different values to school-
level behaviors.
It is interesting to note that dominance and compliance
emerged as distinct in the present studies, in contrast to
national cultures, in which the values were intermixed. This
may point to the highly hierarchical system of schools in
which the roles of students and teachers are defined and
differentiated.
Egalitarianism values were also found to form a clear
region in the present study. The role of cooperation and amity
goals in achievement setting such as school is being increas-
ingly acknowledged (Doyle Lynch et al., 2012; Levontin &
Bardi, 2012). Future studies should examine the relation-
ships between the importance given in schools to collegial-
ity, mutual support (Higgins-D'Alessandro & Sadh, 1997;
Pang, 1996; Rosenblatt & Peled, 2002) and egalitarianism
values, and school climate and success. The role of school-
level egalitarianism values in predicting out-of-school proso-
cial behaviors such as volunteering should also be
investigated.
Harmony values represent one end of the mastery-
harmony dimension. In the school context, they promote
interpersonal consideration and the smooth interaction
between members of the social group. Accordingly, they
were found to relate meaningfully to teacher support and to
student participation in decision making in Israeli high
schools. The involvement of students and teachers in high-
harmony schools is also likely to relate to attitudes toward
out-group members, because harmony values emphasize a
peaceful resolution of conflicts.
Because schools give different emphases to reaching high
academic standards (Pang, 1996), we proposed a school-
level value dimension of achievement. In support of this
hypothesis, a clear achievement value domain emerged in
both studies. The notion that the amount of reinforcement
and incentives for high academic standards (Pang, 1996) is
predicted by schools' achievement values should be investi-
gated in further research. Achievement values at the school
level may provide a clue as to why some schools are com-
petitive and others less so. It can also point to the source of
differences between schools in the motivation of students
and their achievements.
The Interactive Relationships among School
Values
The values found to distinguish among schools can form a
system of preferences characterized by the contradictions
and compatibilities among them. Egalitarianism and auton-
omy are related positively because they share a view of the
social actor as an autonomous entity. Achievement values
relate positively to autonomy values, because they both pre-
sume that changing the status quo is legitimate and desired,
and they both emphasize activity and assuming control over
one's fate. Achievement values are also linked to dominance
values because the aspiration to be first and get ahead is often
at the expense of others, and can result in unequal allocation
of roles and resources (Schwartz, 1999). Dominance and
compliance values are compatible as they both legitimize the
unequal distribution of power within a society that can be
expressed by either assuming a dominant or a subordinate
role. Compliance values are compatible with harmony val-
ues, as they share the emphasis on not disturbing the social or
general status quo. Last, harmony values stand in line with
egalitarianism values as they both emphasize fit into the
social environment rather than controlling it and benefiting
from it (Schwartz, 1999).
Harmony values, which emphasize the fit within the
social world, stand in contrast to achievement values that
emphasize getting ahead and succeeding more than others.
Egalitarianism values, stressing equality among individuals,
stand in contrast to dominance and compliance values that
emphasize legitimization of the social hierarchy (Schwartz,
1999).
The structure of the school-level value system showed
one difference between the studies. In each culture indepen-
dently in Study 1, and in Study 2, the order of the values was
as follows: dominance, compliance, harmony, egalitarian-
ism, autonomy, and achievement. In Study 1, when collaps-
ing both cultures, the order was different, with harmony
values adjacent to dominance and achievement values. This
Daniel et al. 13
order is less theoretically reasonable, and may have resulted
from cultural differences in value importance, with Arab
schools emphasizing harmony and achievement values more
than Jewish schools, creating a spurious correlation between
the values.
School Values and their Relevance to Different
School Members
The finding of substantial school-level correlations in the
importance given to the values in Study 2 points to school
values as a construct that is relevant to individuals of differ-
ent ranks and positions within the school system. This does
not preclude, however, the possibility of average differences
between different groups within the same school. The higher
importance given by teachers as compared with students to
compliance may well reflect the different roles and statuses
that teachers and students have at schools, or the different
ages and stages in life of teachers and students. Such mean
differences are an important path for future research, prefer-
ably with a larger number of schools.
The teacher­student correlations were positive for all val-
ues but extremely high for compliance (r = .96) and egalitari-
anism (r = .93) values. One possibility is that school policies
that affect students and teachers affect the importance of
these values similarly for both groups. Alternatively, values
highly relevant to interpersonal behavior, such as being hum-
ble, modest, and obedient (compliance), and caring, helpful,
and loyal (egalitarianism), may have a mirroring effect
between students and teachers. In schools in which these val-
ues are highly important to teachers, relevant behaviors are
modeled to students and affect the values of the latter.
Although the current design cannot address directly the
issue of teacher influence, the comparison between age
groups is telling. The correlations between teachers' and stu-
dents' values tended to be stronger for the older students.
This may imply a socialization effect, in which as students
remain at school, their values become increasingly similar to
those of their teachers. Another suggestion may be of an age
effect, as older students acquire adult-like value priorities
and are thus becoming increasingly similar to their teachers.
Study Strengths and Limitations
The study has several methodological strengths. First, the
student samples were large. Second, three very different cul-
tural contexts were studied, providing a replication of the
value structure in a predominantly Christian context
(Europe), as well as predominantly Muslim (Israeli Arabs)
and Jewish (Israeli Jews) contexts. The replication of the
value structure in these three contexts suggests that the
school values identified in this study may apply across a
wide range of cultural contexts. The similar meaning
of values across cultures is a precondition for meaningful
cross-cultural comparisons of value importance (see
Schwartz, 1992). A replication of the results in additional
cultural contexts, such as North America, South America,
and Africa, can add to the understanding of school values.
Although using a variety of schools, the study investi-
gates a limited number of schools. In particular, running an
MDS with a large number of variables and a relatively small
number of schools is a limitation, although each school-level
data point represents groups of 15 individuals or more.
Replicating the results using a wider school sample will
strengthen the robustness of the results.
Another strength of the study lies in the comparison of
teachers and students of different ages in Study 2. The large
positive correlations across schools in the importance given
to these values by different subpopulations of the schools
increase our confidence in the findings. However, the large
school samples reached in Study 2 limited the number of
schools in which students of different ages and teachers
could be asked to participate. Study 1 had a much larger
number of schools but with a limited number of students in
each. Although each study's advantages compensate for the
other's limitation, there is still need for a study with a large
number of students and teachers, nested in a substantial num-
ber of schools.
The present study extends beyond identifying school
value dimensions to show the relevance of the values to
important school characteristics. We have demonstrated that
such meaningful relationships exist with teacher support and
school violence. Future studies can pursue many other pos-
sible relations, such as the relations between school values,
school performance, and drop-out rates.
Another possible limitation is the reliance mainly on data
from students. This is the reason for the inclusion of teacher
data in Study 2. Across six schools, student­teacher correla-
tions were positive and large. In addition, the value structure
obtained from teachers' data was very similar to that of stu-
dents (Figure 5). Nevertheless, future studies should seek to
include other members of the school community, such as
principals and nonteaching staff, in addition to students and
teachers.
The measure we used in this study for assessing values,
the PVQ (Schwartz & Rubel, 2005), has been designed spe-
cifically for comparing samples of a broad range of educa-
tional levels and ages. This is one reason we relied on it when
studying the values of adolescents and preadolescents, and
comparing them with those of adults. However, it should be
noted that this questionnaire was devised for studying the
values of individuals, not of schools. It would be beneficial
in future research to test the typology we obtained from the
aggregated individual responses, this time with a specifically
designed measure that directly addresses the values of
schools.

Conclusion
Studies in three cultures pointed out the replicability of the
six value types, largely shared by school members of differ-
ent groups. The typology reported in this article should guide
future research into the phenomenon of school values. The
relevance of the values to variables such as ethnicity and
school violence demonstrates the importance of studying
school-level values.
