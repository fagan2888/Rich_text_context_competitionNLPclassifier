Let us wage a war on totality.
Jean-François Lyotard
Postmodernism appears in many varieties and guises, and
thus, it is deliberately hard to define.According to McDowell,
Hostetler and Bellis (2002),
Trying to define and truly understand postmodernism can be a
lot like standing in an appliance store trying to watch three or
four television shows at once. It defies definition because it is
extremely complex, often contradictory, and constantly
changing. (p. 12)
As a result, no single definition of postmodernism has been
widely accepted. Owing to this fact, I outline a number of
definitions and features of postmodernism that are appropri-
ate to my reading of Hayden White's philosophy of history in
this essay.
Jean-François Lyotard provides one of the most influen-
tial definitions for postmodernism. Lyotard (1984) defines
postmodernism as "incredulity toward metan-arratives" (p.
xxiv). According to Lyotard, in post-modernism, faith in
metanarratives has ebbed, and thus, knowledge has not had
to seek its legitimation universally but locally (p. 60).
Building on Lyotard's definition, Linda Hutcheon (1989) in
her "Incredulity Toward Metanarrative" argues that post-
modernism "is characterized by no grand totalizing master
narrative but by smaller and multiple narratives which do not
seek (or obtain) any universalizing stabilization or legitima-
tion" (p. 186). Based on these definitions, postmodernism
rejects metanarratives in favor of mininarratives that are pro-
visional, contingent, and relational and makes no claim to
totality, objectivity, universality, and absolute truth.
Because postmodernism maintains that there exists no
absolute truth, it follows that there exists no basis for abso-
lute meaning; rather, meanings are individually and/or
socially constructed. This implies that there exists no single
fixed meaning and interpretation of history, but plurality of
readings and interpretations, not to mention that the interests
of individuals, groups, and nations can play a significant role
in forming their readings and interpretations. In addition,
postmodernism sees history as linguistic constructs and man-
made discourses, which are not given or natural. These con-
structs and discourses--which consist of a set of words,
selected and assembled by historians into narratives with
plots--are pregnant with a galaxy of devices that make them
indeterminate and contradictory, ironical and paradoxical. It
is worth noting that to revisit and reexamine the historical
texts, postmodernism foregrounds ironies and paradoxes that
exist within those texts, mainly because ironies and para-
doxes, due to their critical and subversive power, can help
the readers and researchers to pinpoint the contradictions
within historical texts. The implication of this is that post-
modernism does not deny the existence of history but invites
the readers and researchers to rethink and reenvision it, and
this is an attempt to rehistoricize rather than dehistoricize
history.
Moreover, postmodernism denies that the historians are
objective observers of historical events and objective record-
ers of historical accounts. Historians record what they wish,

Revisiting History in Hayden White's
Philosophy
Mehdi Ghasemi1
Abstract
In his "Historical Fiction, Fictional History, and Historical Reality," Hayden White writes "What we postmodernists are against
is a professional historiography." This statement inspired me to reexamine a number of White's oeuvre from the perspective
of postmodernism so as to find out in what ways and to what extent White is a postmodernist. In addition, I highlight a
number of preoccupations of professional historiography and argue how White deploys the discourse of postmodernism to
dismantle them.

and their own limitations, interests, and biases of any kind
ultimately affect and surface in their accounts. In this cli-
mate, postmodernism seeks for self-reflexive history wherein
readers can be more aware of some of the limitations, inter-
ests, and biases behind the historians' writings. Owing to
these reasons, postmodernism rejects professional historians
and their belief in the scientific status of history and histori-
ography, teleology, totality, certainty, objectivity, universal-
ity, and essentialism. In his "Historical Fiction, Fictional
History, and Historical Reality," Hayden White (2005a)
writes "What we postmodernists are against is a professional
historiography" (p. 152). This statement inspired me to reex-
amine a number of White's oeuvre from the perspective of
postmodernism so as to find out in what ways and to what
extent White is a postmodernist? In addition, I highlight a
number of preoccupations of professional historiography and
argue how White deploys the discourse of postmodernism to
dismantle them.
White (1978) in his "The Historical Text as Literary
Artifact" maintains that while emplotting a set of events
(e.g., a, b, c, d, e, . . . , n), the historians are required to give
meanings to them through describing or characterizing them.
In this process, the historians may privilege the "status given
to certain events or set of events in the series," shown by
White with the capitalized letters:
1. A, b, c, d, e, . . ., n
2. a, B, c, d, e, . . ., n
3. a, b, C, d, e, . . ., n
4. a, b, c, D, e, . . ., n. (p. 54)
Such accounts of history indicate both subjectivity and
plurality of narratives that question the existence of one sin-
gle, monolithic, total, or grand narrative. As an example,
White (1966) refers to Burckhardt's Civilization of the
Renaissance and states that "[Burckhardt's] intention was
not to tell the whole truth about the Italian Renaissance but
one truth about it" (p. 44, emphasis in original). He continues
that "there is no such thing as a single correct view of any
object under study but that there are many correct views" (p.
47, emphasis in original). The stated example followed by
these statements clearly show that White denies the existence
of one grand narrative as the ultimate Truth with regard to an
event--in this case, the Italian Renaissance--and avoids
confining history to one definitive monolithic narrative.
White's position here is based on postmodernism style of
thought that breeds skepticism toward ultimate Truth as well
as the objectivity of grand narratives. It should be noted that
postmodernism as a way to detotalize and reinscribe the
dominant order of hierarchy rejects any totalizing or unify-
ing view of history. This is to say that postmodernism pro-
vides a foundation for countering and deconstructing the
grand narratives of history that are to substantiate their domi-
nance and legitimation. The deconstruction of grand
narratives is thus an attempt to free thoughts from
the hegemony of grand narratives and to clear space for
mininarratives, which raise difference, heterogeneity, and
multiplicity. Under these circumstances and as a result of
replacement of grand narratives with mininarratives, post-
modernism is dynamic, ceaselessly oscillating between two
poles of "making" and "unmaking," "presentation" and "rep-
resentation." As Hutcheon (1988) observes, "Postmodernism
is a contradictory phenomenon, one that uses and abuses,
installs and then subverts" (p. 3). These nonstop movements
between these poles help researchers to expand their realms
of insight and embrace plurality of narratives. Seen in this
light, grand narrative accounts of history that claim reference
to absolute Truth are not truer than other mininarrative
accounts of history.
In his attempt to replace grand, all-encompassing narra-
tives with petits récits, which signifies the exigency of plu-
rality of narratives, White (1987) then takes a further step in
his Metahistory when he writes,
In my view, "history," as a plenum of documents that attest to
the occurrence of events, can be put together in a number of
different and equally plausible narrative accounts of "what
happened in the past," accounts from which the reader of the
historian himself, may draw different conclusions about "what
must be done" in the present. (p. 283, emphasis in original)
In this excerpt, White, in addition to stressing the exi-
gency of plurality of narratives, certifies the plurality of
readings and interpretations. To this end, White shifts the
locus of attention from the historian/author as the prime
"author"ity to the text and the interaction between the text
and the reader. From my standpoint, this is a postmodern
attempt to free history from the shackles of an authoritarian
ideology, imposed by the historian/author, through under-
mining the authority of the author and empowering the read-
ers. White (2000) clearly states the exigency of neglecting
the historians'/authors' intentions when he writes, "when we
are concerned with the history of historical writing, it is the
intentions of the text that should interest us, not the inten-
tions of the writer" (p. 406). Moreover, he highlights the
detachment between the author and the text in his interview
with Ewa Domanska (1993): "I am inclined to follow people
like Foucault and Barthes. So I say, the text in some sense is
detached from the author" (p. 16). The detachment of text
from the author recalls Roland Barthes's theory of "the Death
of Author." Admittedly, the death of author paves the way for
"the birth of readers" and naturally the arrival of newly born
perspectives that bring about the plurality of readings as well
as the multiplicity of interpretations, which are in line with
the aims of postmodernism.
The plurality of readings and the multiplicity of interpre-
tations, which aim to liberate us all from the coercive ideas
of absolute Truth, bring undecidability to the narratives. This
sense of undecidability then makes the narratives in Roland
Barthes's term "writerly texts," opening the space for diverse
Ghasemi 3
interpretations to arise, which altogether exhibit a postmod-
ern sensibility. Under these circumstances, the readers are no
longer passive recipients and consumers but active partici-
pants and producers of meanings from history transcripts.
They play a creative role in the process of decoding and con-
structing meanings as they are required to go through this
process of meaning-making, and naturally, the meanings
they make may greatly differ from one another. In this cli-
mate, postmodernism can be seen as a departure from one
single monolithic interpretation and the arrival of miscella-
neous interpretations.
In addition to the exigency of the plurality of narratives
and the plurality of readings and interpretations, White bears
down on the plurality of interests. As White (1978) writes,
no historical event is intrinsically tragic; it can only be conceived
as such from a particular point of view or from within the context
of a structured set of events of which it is an element enjoying a
privileged place. For in history what is tragic from one
perspective is comic from another. (p. 47)
Furthermore, in "Literary Theory and Historical Writing,"
White (1999a) rewords this idea as such: "[History] is made
on both sides of the barricades, and just as effectively by one
side as by the other" (p. 13). In these excerpts, in addition to
stressing multivoicedness and plurality, White notes that
while a historical narrative for a group brings dignity and
identity, it can at the same time be considered a nekbah and
disgrace for another group. Both of these statements are in
line with another tenet of postmodernism, which claims that
truth is community-based; it is simply relational, local, and
perspectival, and whatever we accept as truth is dependent
on the interests of the community we favor. Naturally, differ-
ent groups, nations, and even individuals favor different
accounts or narratives according to their own social, national,
religious, political, and economic interests, and connections
of any type, which rebuts the idea of "disinterested objectiv-
ity" in professional historiography.
As seen in all excerpts above, White makes a triangular
move from the plurality of narratives to the plurality of read-
ings and then to the plurality of interests. White (1987) in
Metahistory sketches his pluralistic standpoint as such: "we
are free to conceive `history' as we please, just as we are free
to make of it what we will" (p. 433). In such a climate, the
plurality of narratives, readings, and interests foregrounds
polyphony, or in Ihab Hassan's term "multivocation," a post-
modern feature that maintains that there exist multiple ver-
sions of reality or truths as read, seen, and interpreted from
different perspectives.
From another perspective, according to postmodern
scholars Mas'ud Zavarzadeh and Donald Morton (1991),
history should not be accounted as a solid and fixed narrative
but "a contestation of diverse textualizations" (p. 54). This is
what White most clearly wants to communicate in a number
of his oeuvre, showing that history is not fixed any more but
constantly in flux and process, and as a result, it is the history
of "becoming" rather than the history of "being." In this way,
he interrogates the idea of fixed historiography, exploring the
possibilities of situating different perspectives in rewriting
history, which releases historiography from being seen as a
fixed entity. In his essay, "Literary Theory and Historical
Writing," White (1999a) quotes Frank R. Ankersmit as
saying,
The great books in the field of the history of historiography . . .
do not put an end to a historical debate, do not give us the feeling
that we now finally know how things actually were in the past
and that clarity has ultimately been achieved. On the contrary:
these books have proved to be the most powerful stimulators of
the production of more writing--their effect is thus to estrange
us from the past, instead of placing it upon a kind of pedestal in
a historiographical museum so that we can inspect it from all
possible perspectives. (p. 7, emphasis in original)
Seen in his light, history and historiography are not final
and ultimate but a process that is never completed. To clarify
my argument, I would like to liken historiography to a chess
game rather than a puzzle. As we know, one single place has
been predetermined for each piece in a puzzle, and in case
we wrongly place it, the image is not truly created. This is an
example for a system of "being" or a closed machinery sys-
tem. However, in a chess game, we have various moves and
options before ourselves, and with each move, a new trend is
opened before us. This is an example of the system of
"becoming" or an open or organic system.
We can think of White's synoptic table as a chessboard
with each item as a man. To White, any of the modes of
emplotment can be combined with any of the modes of argu-
ment and any of the modes of ideology, and thus, one can
have a history written as "mechanistic anarchist ironic com-
edy" or "organicist radical metaphoric satire." This state-
ment clearly shows that historians decide and impose their
own modes of emplotment. Postmodernism argues that what
we call knowledge is a special kind of text or discourse that
puts together words and images in ways that seem pleasing
to readers or to members of a nation or a group. In the system
of becoming, the historiographers enjoy a sense of "optional-
ism," which helps them freely choose among different modes
of emplotment. In other words, the optionality of tropology
leaves enough room for the use of different modes of ideo-
logical and argumentative implications. This is to say that
White's view of emplotment rests on human choices, and
admittedly miscellaneous factors can affect human choices.
This leads me to conclude that the application of optionalism
in historiography paves the way for the interference of human
choices in historical writing that rebuts the objectivity of his-
toriography. White (1999a) deals with the interference of
human choices in historical writing when he enumerates
three tropological abductions:
1. Representation in which the preparation of chronicles
of events occur. I would like to liken it to cooking in
4 SAGE Open
which the cook prepares the required ingredients and
raw materials for his own purpose according to his
own cuisine.
2. Transformation in which the historians choose among
different types of plot structure to shape the chroni-
cles into a story based on a sequential order. In this
part, the cook chops some of the raw materials and
puts the ingredients into the pot one or two at a time.
3. Constitution in which the historian establishes mea-
ning whether cognitive, ethical, or aesthetic for the
objects, and to me, it is like adding some spice to the
dish and serving it. It merits noting that the amount of
spice used may change the nature of the work from
being "meaningful" to "meaning-full" in Keith
Jenkins's (2008, p. 60) term.
Admittedly, in all these three tropological abductions, his-
toriographers' personal preferences and national, social,
political, and economic interests directly and at different lev-
els interfere in their works; what materials to use, what
emplotment modes to use, and what meanings to constitute,
not to mention their limitations and deficiencies all and all
can affect the nature of their products. Moreover, I would
like to argue that the analysis of these tropological abduc-
tions is indeed to "wage a war on totality" as it provides
White with a possibility to dissect the professional historiog-
raphy and detotalize it through interrogating its historical
knowledge and objectivity. The dissection of professional
historiography then helps White (2005a) discover "the
resources of poiesis (invention) and artistic writing" (p. 152)
used in it and its ties with art, the means that endowed it pro-
fessionality, and this is a reverse move toward the time prior
to emplotment. As White (2005b) states in his "The Public
Relevance of Historical Studies: A Reply to Dirk Moses,"
The salvation of professional historiography . . . [is] in reversing
or rather amending our notions of history's importance as a field
of study, the revision of history's so-called "methodology," and
most importantly a return to the intimate relationship it had with
art, poetry, rhetoric, and ethical reflection prior to
professionalization. (p. 335)
In my view, White's reverse move toward the time prior to
emplotment is a self-reflexive cognition and intuition, which
as a process of self-revising and self-monitoring illuminates
the artificiality of the professional historiography.
White also proffers the exigency of this reverse move
toward the time prior to emplotment in his "The Modernist
Event." In that essay, White (1999b) raises the issue of the
invention of plotless and subjectless historiography in the
20th century as well as "the creation of the new genres of
postmodern parahistorical representation" (p. 66). However,
if then so, it seems that the fragmented style of writing and
its nonlinearity, its time distortion and dislocation "explode
the conventions of the traditional tale" (p. 82). White's quest
for the invention of plotless and subjectless historiography is
a postmodern intention that deconstructs the concepts of
location and time so that the narratives no longer follow a
progressive coherent linear plot, which brings about "disinte-
gration" in Hassan's term and results in the creation of omni-
temporality, dislodgment, and "multiperspectival setting"
with different variables.
In such a climate, the historian sounds to provide the read-
ers with the unknitted wools of the history garment, making
the grounds for reworking and reknitting of its contents,
which is to involve the readers in the process of history
reknitting, and this is in line with "participation," a postmod-
ern technique. I also would like to argue that this reverse
move toward the time prior to emplotment recalls Charles
Russell (1985) who believes that postmodernism asserts and
then undermines such principles as order, meaning, and con-
trol. White's (1966) quest for the invention of plotless and
subjectless historiography is also stated in his "The Burden
of History," wherein he requires "a history that will educate
us to discontinuity more than ever before; for discontinuity,
disruption, and chaos is our lot" (p. 50). No doubt, disconti-
nuity, disruption, and chaos can bring about alternative
points of view and multiplicity of interpretations. However,
these conditions that raise unresolved paradoxes are insatia-
ble to the professional historians and their fans who seek for
continuity as well as absolute and final meaning, but to post-
modern thinkers, they provoke new articulations and contra-
dictions and pose the questions that may eventually lead to
the answers of different heterogeneous types.
Furthermore, White (2005b) in his "The Public relevance
of Historical Studies: A Reply to Dirk Moses" favors "cul-
tural relativism" (p. 337) as the best policy that can lead to
tolerance rather than intolerance to understand the position
of the other side. It merits noting that from the perspective of
cultural relativism, all groups produce specialized thought,
and each group's thought is equally valid. No group can
claim to have a better interpretation of the "truth" than the
others. Considering this fact, White then introduces the pro-
fessional historians as the ones who are afraid of relativists
because the relativists might reveal the factitiousness of their
works and impugn the authenticity of their products. White
(2000) in his response to Georg G. Iggers criticizes the objec-
tive position of these historians, adding that "historical facts
are invented . . . they do not come `given'or as `data'already
packaged as `facts'" (p. 398). This fact is also echoed by
Linda Hutcheon. As Hutcheon (1988) writes,
What [postmodernism] does say is that there are all kinds of
orders and systems in our world--and that we create them all. . . .
They do not exist "out there", fixed, given, universal, eternal;
they are human constructs in history. (p. 43)
This is an attempt to increase incredulity toward objectiv-
ity and genuinity, claimed by the professional historians, and
to imply the exigency of fluidity rather than fixity when
Ghasemi 5
dealing with historical events. As White (2005a) writes in his
"Historical Fiction, Fictional History, and Historical Reality,"
It is no longer a matter of searching in obscure archives for the
one new document that will authorize the admission of at least
one hitherto unknown "fact" to the normative narrative account
of a community's history. Anyone opening up any topic on
"Google" will find an intimidatingly long list of sources,
secondary and primary, that could take a lifetime to examine,
much less analyse or interpret. (p. 151)
From the above excerpt, it is inferred that White is to
avoid the trap that reduces history and historiography to
"only one way of being," and this is in line with the ultimate
end of postmodernism and its quest for the dissolution of fix-
ity. In addition, White intends to question the authenticity of
one single document coming from a particular archive as the
only genuine and legitimate source of knowledge. It is worth
noting that in "The Burden of History," White (1966) speaks
of dynamism and states that in a dynamic universe--like
dynamic science and dynamic art--history can bring new
perspectives to the camp. This standpoint indicates that
White considers history a dynamic field, too, and this is to
take distance from professional historiography, characterized
by causality, totality, and fixity. White's belief in dynamism
in science, art, and history is based on the postulate of post-
modernism that aims to reject essentialist objective views
while seeing society, history, and culture in transformation.
Furthermore, what the professional historians see as an
event that has actually happened in the past is seen by White
as a "text" written by human beings. And we all agree that a
text is made of language that can be paradoxical, ambiguous,
ironical, and indeterminate. It should be stated here that post-
modernism denies the fixity of language and its interpreta-
tion, mainly because language is itself pregnant with a galaxy
of devices that offer optionalism of meanings and pluralism
of interpretations. Diction or the choice of words with deno-
tative and connotative meanings; the play of signifiers with a
galaxy of signifieds; the presence of different (mis)spellings
and puns, which can puzzle the readers, are just a few fea-
tures of language as a dynamic entity that can add fuel to the
fire of indeterminacy and create ambiguity and (mis)lead the
readers to various interpretations. Seen in this light, post-
modernism thus denies both the ability of language or dis-
course to refer to an independent world of facts and things
and the determinacy or decidability of textual meaning.
It should be noted that postmodernism favors uncertainty
and marginalizes fixed meaning, and accordingly, it avoids
resolving the contradictions and indeterminacies, which
exist in language structures. The presence of contradictions
and indeterminacies liberates the imagination from old and
fixed meanings and results in hermeneutical plurality. Seen
in this light, unresolved paradoxes to postmodern thinkers
provoke new articulations and raise questions that may (mis)
lead to different answers. As a result, as Ihab Hassan (1987)
notes, interpretation becomes "prejudicial, uncertain, and
suspect" (p. 449). In his response to Iggers, White (2000)
refers to this fact as such:
Because language offers a variety of ways of construing an
object and fixing it in an image or concept, historians have a
choice in the modalities of figuration they can use to emplot
series of events as manifesting different meanings. There is
nothing deterministic about this. The modes of figuration and of
explanation may be limited, but their combinations in a given
discourse are virtually unlimited. . . . The words, grammar, and
syntax of any language obey no clear rule for distinguishing
between the denotative and connotative dimensions of a given
utterance. (p. 395)
In addition, we should bear in mind that postmodernism
subverts the neutral status of language as a disinterested
medium of representation, and no doubt, it is already
inflected with power relations.
Moreover, we need to take language deficiency in repre-
senting the past and its reality into account, which deprives
the historiographers from recording the events as they have
really been. Here, I would like to refer to two statements in
White's (2000) response to Iggers that recall Jean
Baudrillard's idea of "hyperreality." According to White,
"The representation of a thing is not the thing itself" (p. 396).
He continues that "historical knowledge is always second-
order knowledge" (p. 398). The former statement may sig-
nify that the perception can be different from expression.
This difference may partly originate from language as a par-
tial and deficient medium. The latter statement signifies that
historical knowledge is based on "hypothetical construc-
tions" and distant from a genuine and objective investiga-
tion. According to Baudrillard (1990), postmodernity is
defined by a shift into hyperreality in which simulations
replace the real, and accordingly, reality is no longer real, but
hyperreal. For instance, in painting, the artist puts together
different colors to make an image to represent a thing. In his-
tory, the historian attempts to put words together so as to
record and represent an event, but admittedly in both cases,
reality is no longer real, and consequently, what we achieve
is not a "reflection" but a "representation" of events that--
due to the reasons mentioned--is not genuine.
Accordingly, the representation of an event does not offer
a thorough and total view of the event. In his "The Modernist
Event," White (1999b) enumerates a number of events,
occurred in the 20th century, such as the two world wars, the
Great Depression, the population explosion, and so on, and
claims that "these kinds of event do not lend themselves to
explanation in terms of the categories underwritten by tradi-
tional humanistic historiography" (pp. 70-71). As White
writes, "historians are challenged in both their access to the
past and in their representing it. . . . There is no past available
to our inspection" (quoted in Pihlainen, 2013, p. 126).
Because the past is no longer open to our perception and
6 SAGE Open
inspection, we cannot be certain that any description of it is
adequate to it. The unavailability of past raises the question
whether we have access to any overall truth about the pres-
ent. Reading from this perspective, I think, like the past, the
present is not "available to our inspection," either, and thus,
the historians today in action more or less suffer from the
same limitations of historians in the past. It sounds that the
same holes, originating from the fallibilities from which his-
tory is and has suffered in the past--namely, deficiency of
records, language deficiency, and partiality in representing
the events, as well as the fallibility of producers--abound
and are still available to us in the present. To testify the exis-
tence of holes in the historical representations and the
unavailability of overall truth of events, White (1999b)
quotes Gertrude Stein saying that an event may be an "out-
side without inside" (p. 82).
In what ways, however, can the historians remark the
existent holes in the Great Whole of History? To answer this
question, we should study four types of trope, including met-
aphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony, enumerated by
White. However, which one of these tropes is of more sig-
nificance for White? To my surprise, White (1999b) states
that "I have no reason to prefer synecdochic historians to
ironic ones or vice versa" (p. 12). He speaks as a father who
claims that he loves all his children equally; however, I agree
with Frank R. Ankersmit (1998) who believes that irony is
more prominent in White's tropology, an access to or a
glimpse of past. Likewise, Richard T. Vann (1998) refers to
irony as a "super-trope" (p. 151), believing that "White never
denied that his own stance was ironic" (p. 152). It should be
noted that irony with its critical power provides the ground to
question, and this is in line with postmodernism intention as
well as White's who refuses to look at history and historiog-
raphy as a system of "being." This way of referring to the
past is in line with Hutcheon's (1988) idea when she writes,
"one never returns to the past without distance," and that dis-
tance in postmodernism is "signaled by irony" (p. 39). In
addition, this device, according to Hutcheon (1988), is "dou-
ble-voicings, for they play one meaning off against another"
(p. 211).
The emphasis on irony, thus, helps the researchers to
remark a number of existent holes in the structure of history
as irony has a subversive potential that can remove the text
from its totality and essentialized genuinity. For that reason,
Umberto Eco (1983) states, "the past . . . must be revisited,
but with irony, not innocently" (p. 67), simply because irony
can pinpoint the cracks in the walls of castle of history and
provide a unique opportunity for researchers to identify the
contradictions in it. I would like to argue that White's
acknowledgment of the existence of holes in history is itself
another measure to detotalize history.
In this climate, White (1966) believes that the duty of the
researchers in present time is to transform the historical stud-
ies so as to liberate the present from the burden of history and
to make the historical studies fit in the aims of the
community. Seen in this light, history is not seen as a fixed
ultimate entity that cannot be touched and that the historians
have to accept it as it is. However, the historians should
refuse to study the past as an end or ultimate being but con-
tribute to offer some solutions for the problems of the pres-
ent, which the professional historiography is unable to
achieve. Moreover, what White (1966) is reluctant to achieve
and certifies it in his "The Burden of History"
is to reestablish the dignity of historical studies on a basis that
will make them consonant with the aims and purposes of the
intellectual community at large, that is, transform historical
studies in such a way as to allow the historian to participate
positively in the liberation of the present from the burden of
history. (pp. 40-41, emphasis is original)
From this excerpt, it is inferred that White attempts to
rehistoricize rather than dehistoricize history.
Rehistoricization is in fact an attempt to offer a rereading of
history that can help to redefine the views of history and fill
the readers with new significations. Thus, postmodernism
does not deny the existence of the past or subvert history.
Rather, it seeks to subvert the grand totalizing narratives of
history or the hegemony and authenticity of one narrative
over the other ones so as to set the readers free from the bur-
den of history. As Hutcheon (1988) asserts, postmodernism
criticizes historiography rather than rejecting history and
attempts to reformulate the project of history. She later notes
that "Postmodernism does not deny that [history] existed; it
merely questions how we can know real past events today,
except through their traces, their texts, the facts we construct
and to which we grant meaning" (p. 225). Rebutting Andreas
Huyssen's idea that postmodernism relegates history to the
"dustbin of an obsolete episteme," Hutcheon (1988) believes
that "History is not made obsolete; it is, however, being
rethought--as a human construct" (p. 16). In this climate,
rehistoricization enables the readers to reenvision the domi-
nant value systems of history and embrace inclusive collec-
tive systems of history, which indeed drives a shift from
univocality to polyvocality.
Accordingly, as a transcendental historian for whom the
existence of past is a prerequisite for historical study, Hayden
White does not deny the existence of history but invites us to
rethink and reconstrue history for the purpose of its "decon-
struction" rather than its "destruction." As White (1999a)
writes in "Literary Theory and Historical Writing," "History
can only be read if it is first written" (p. 2). Likewise, White
(2005a) remarks, "That events actually occurred in an `olden
time' cannot be doubted, since there is plenty of factual evi-
dence attesting to their occurrence" (p. 148). These state-
ments clearly reveal that White, unlike metaphysical
historians, is not to deny the happening of objects in the past,
but unlike professional historians, he refuses to approach and
embrace history as a total, genuine, teleological, unproblem-
atic, absolute, monolithic entity. In contrast, he views history

as decentered, discontinuous, and plural. He is fully aware
that historiography is selective in description and inevitably
is written from the particular angles and views of historiog-
raphers, who are neither infallible nor disinterested. He is
also fully aware of the language partiality and deficiency in
recording and representing events. Thus, White as a promi-
nent advocate of the postmodernist theory of history attempts
to detotalize or denaturalize history through creating aware-
ness that history is a man-made discourse and not an absolute
given truth. His approach helps him revisit history, increase
incredulity toward and dissolution of dominant
metanarratives,and proffer alternative perspectives with
regard to history.
