Multinational Firms, Exclusivity, and the
Degree of Backward Linkages
Ping LIN and Kamal SAGGI
November 16, 2004
Abstract
This paper develops a two-tier oligopoly model in which the entry
of a multinational firm results in technology transfer to its local sup-
pliers and also impacts the degree of backward linkages in the local
industry. The model endogenizes the multinational's choice between
anonymous market interaction with its suppliers and contractual re-
lationships with them under which the multinational transfer tech-
nology to its suppliers who in turn agree to serve the multinational
exclusively. The multinational's entry under an exclusive contract has
a de-linking effect that can reduce the degree of competition among
suppliers thereby leading to a decline in the level of backward link-
ages and local welfare. With its emphasis on the supply-side effects
of the multinational's entry on local industry, this paper complements
existing studies of backward linkages that focus more on demand-side
effects.

Non Technical Summary
It is well recognized that two important channels through which the entry of
multinational firms can affect a host country are technology transfer and the generation
of backward linkages. While these two channels have been studied extensively in
isolation, no existing analysis allows them to operate simultaneously. Two questions are
of immediate interest: First, what is the relationship between vertical technology
transfer (VTT) from a multinational to its local suppliers and the equilibrium degree of
backward linkages? Second, and perhaps more importantly, how does the nature of
contractual relationships between multinationals and their local suppliers affect the
degree of backward linkages in the local industry? The objective of this paper is to shed
light on these questions.
We develop a two-tier model in which the production of a final good requires an
intermediate good and market structure at both stages of production is oligopolistic. The
model focuses on the entry decision of a multinational firm that produces the final good.
Upon entry, the multinational sources the intermediate good locally and also engages in
vertical technology transfer (VTT) to its suppliers if it enters into a contractual
relationship with them. Under a contractual relationship, the selected suppliers must
abide by an exclusivity condition that precludes them from serving other customers.
The model developed in this paper differs from existing literature on backward linkages
in two main respects. First, while existing literature focuses on the demand-creating
effects of the entry of multinational firms on local industry, we focus on the supply-side
effects of such entry. In particular, VTT and the possibility of exclusive contract
between the multinational and its local suppliers are two key ingredients of our model.
Our second point of departure from existing literature is that our model considers
oligopolistic competition at both the upstream and downstream stages of production.
Such a setting enables us to examine how the contractual relationship between the
multinational and its suppliers affects strategic interaction in the local industry.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Es wird allgemein anerkannt, dass sich der Markteinstieg eines multinationalen
Unternehmens auf das Gastland mittels zweier wichtiger Kanäle auswirken kann,
nämlich über den Technologietransfer und durch die Generierung von Beziehungen zu
Zulieferern. Jeder dieser beiden Kanäle wurde zwar isoliert eingehend untersucht, aber
ihr simultanes Zusammenwirken wurde bisher nicht analysiert. Zwei Fragen sind hier
von unmittelbarer Bedeutung. Erstens: Welcher Zusammenhang besteht zwischen dem
vertikalen Technologietransfer (VTT) von einem multinationalen Unternehmen zu
seinen lokalen Zulieferern und dem Gleichgewichtsgrad dieser Beziehung? Die zweite
und möglicherweise wichtigere Frage lautet: Welchen Einfluss hat die Art der
vertraglichen Vereinbarung zwischen einem multinationalen Unternehmen und seinen
lokalen Anbietern auf die entsprechende Beziehung in der lokalen Industrie? Im
vorliegenden Papier sollen diese beiden Fragen näher beleuchtet werden.
Wir entwickeln ein Zweistufenmodell, das zur Produktion einer Fertigware eine
Vorleistungsware voraussetzt und in beiden Produktionsphasen eine oligopolistische
Marktstruktur hat. Das Modell konzentriert sich auf die Einstiegsentscheidung eines
multinationalen Unternehmens, das die Fertigware herstellt. Beim Markteinstieg bezieht
das multinationale Unternehmen die Vorleistungsware lokal und führt auch einen
vertikalen Technologietransfer (VTT) an seine Zulieferer durch, falls es mit diesen eine
vertragliche Verbindung eingeht. Wenn eine Vertragsvereinbarung besteht, so sind die
entsprechenden Zulieferer durch eine Exklusivitätsklausel gebunden, die sie daran
hindert, andere Kunden zu beliefern.
Das hier entwickelte Modell unterscheidet sich vor allem in zwei Punkten von der
vorliegenden Literatur. Zum einen konzentriert sich die einschlägige Literatur auf die
nachfrageinduzierenden Effekte, die vom Markteintritt eines multinationalen
Unternehmens auf die lokale Industrie ausgehen, während hier der Schwerpunkt auf die
Auswirkungen eines derartigen Markteintritts auf die Angebotsseite gelegt wird. Zwei
wesentliche Punkte in diesem Modell sind insbesondere der VTT und der mögliche
Abschluss eines Exklusivvertrags zwischen dem multinationalen Unternehmen und
seinen lokalen Zulieferbetrieben. Zum anderen unterscheidet sich dieses Papier noch
dadurch von der bisherigen Literatur, dass in dem hier verwendeten Modell der
oligopolistische Wettbewerb sowohl in den vor- als auch in den nachgelagerten
Produktionsphasen berücksichtigt wird. Ein derartiges Szenario ermöglicht die
Untersuchung des Einflusses der Vertragsvereinbarung zwischen dem multinationalen
Unternehmen und seinen Zulieferern auf das strategische Zusammenspiel in der lokalen
Industrie.

It is well recognized that two important channels through which the entry
of multinational firms can affect a host country are technology transfer and
the generation of backward linkages.1 While these two channels have been
studied extensively in isolation, no existing analysis allows them to oper-
ate simultaneously. Two questions are of immediate interest: First, what is
the relationship between vertical technology transfer (vtt) from a multina-
tional to its local suppliers and the equilibrium degree of backward linkages?
Second, and perhaps more importantly, how does the nature of contractual
relationships between multinationals and their local suppliers affect the de-
gree of backward linkages in the local industry?2 The objective of this paper
is to shed light on these questions.
We develop a two-tier model in which the production of a final good
requires an intermediate good and market structure at both stages of pro-
duction is oligopolistic. The model focuses on the entry decision of a multi-
national firm that produces the final good. Upon entry, the multinational
sources the intermediate good locally and also engages in vertical technology
transfer (vtt) to its suppliers if it enters into a contractual relationship with
them. Under a contractual relationship, the selected suppliers must abide by
an exclusivity condition that precludes them from serving other customers.
Exclusivity requirements in the context of international technology trans-
fer are empirically relevant. In a recent survey of 413 companies in the au-
tomobile sector in Central and Eastern Europe, Lorentzen and Mollgaard
1The concept of linkages is due to Albert O. Hirschman (1958).
2To the best of our knowledge, contractual relationships between multinationals and
their suppliers have not received any attention in related analytical literature. Existing
analyses of backward linkages focus mainly on market interaction between multinationals
and local firms.

(2000) found that 61 percent of the automobile parts manufacturers had re-
ceived technology from their customers (automobile assemblers, which are
mostly multinational companies), and 36 percent of the customers imposed
an exclusivity condition on their suppliers. Similarly, according to Mizuno
(1995), car component suppliers in South Korea can be classified into the fol-
lowing types: (1) the exclusive type which supply over 75% of total produc-
tion to their principal car manufacturers; (2) the semi-exclusive type which
supply 50-75 percent of total production to their principal car manufacturers;
and (3) the dispersed type (and the independent type) which supply below
50% of their total production to their principal car manufacturers.3
Our focus on contractual relationships uncovers an interesting new effect
called the de-linking effect. In fact, in our model, exclusivity necessarily
implies de-linking between local final good firms and their suppliers. Such de-
linking makes the intermediate good market less competitive due to market
separation (or foreclosure of competition) and can cause total output of the
intermediate good (as well the final good) to shrink. This point emerges most
sharply in the case where the intermediate good is produced by a duopoly
and this case is discussed in detail toward the latter part of the paper.
The de-linking effect is reminiscent of an astute observation made by
Rodriguez-Clare (1996): when analyzing the effect of multinationals on back-
ward linkages in a host country, it is important to recognize that multination-
3It is worth noting that multinationals have an incentive to impose exclusivity even
in the absence of vtt. Driven by strategic considerations, a multinational may impose
exclusivity on its suppliers so as to foreclose its local rivals from having access to a wide
range of suppliers. As the number of their suppliers declines, the multinational's local
rivals are forced to pay a higher price for the intermediate goods, thereby giving a cost-
advantage to the multinational. This raising the rivals' cost motive and the potential
anti-competitive effects of exclusivity practices on the part of multinational companies
are discussed in the World Investment Report of 1997 (UNCTAD, 1997). See Salop and
Scheffman (1987) for the seminal contribution on cost raising strategies.

als don't just create new linkages -- they also displace pre-existing linkages
between local firms and suppliers. In our context, such displacement oc-
curs contractually whereas in Rodriguez-Clare it occurs if the multinational
finds it optimal to source intermediates from its source country headquarters
(which is the case when communication costs are high). Thus, the present
paper highlights an independent mechanism via which multinationals alter
the degree of linkages in the host country.
Our model permits an investigation of conditions under which the multi-
national prefers to impose exclusivity on its local suppliers as well as factors
that lead the latter to accept such a condition. In general, a multinational
faces the following conflicting incentives. On the one hand, exclusivity seems
natural when viewed from the intellectual property protection perspective
of the multinational: it has a strategic incentive to prevent its local rivals
from benefitting from vtt and this can be accomplished via exclusivity. On
the other hand, the multinational would also like a large number of sup-
pliers to serve it in order to secure the intermediate at a more competitive
price. However, exclusivity tends to discourage local suppliers from serving
the multinational since they have to give up the opportunity of serving other
local producers. It is shown that, in equilibrium, the multinational is able
to implement exclusivity if and only if the extent of vtt exceeds a critical
level. By contrast, when the degree of vtt is low, only a small number of
local suppliers are willing to accept exclusivity, leading the multinational to
prefer market interaction.
The literature on multinationals and technology transfer is vast and has
been surveyed by Blomstorm and Kokko (1996), and Saggi (2002). With the
exception of Pack and Saggi (2001) much of the analytical literature has ig-
3
nored technology transfer between multinationals and their suppliers.4 This
is unfortunate since empirical evidence on productivity spillovers indicates
that there is no guarantee that (horizontal) spillovers from multinationals to
their local rivals will materialize whereas the evidence on vtt is quite pos-
itive -- see Aitken and Harrison (1999), Moran (1998), Blalock and Gertler
(2002), Javorcik (2004). In his empirical study of vtt in the Indian trucking
industry, Lall (1980) notes that vtt can take places in several ways. A multi-
national might (1) help prospective suppliers set up production capacities;
(2) provide technical assistance/information to raise the quality of suppliers'
products and/or to facilitate innovations; and (3) provide training and help
in management and organization. Our model captures channel (2) of vtt.
There exists a voluminous informal as well as empirical literature on back-
ward linkages. For example, the 1996 issue of the World Investment Report
was devoted entirely to the effects of foreign direct investment on backward
linkages in host countries. However, analytical models that explore the rela-
tionship between multinationals and backward linkages in the host country
are hard to come by. To the best of our knowledge, there exist only two such
studies: Markusen and Venables (1999) and Rodriguez-Clare (1996). Both
these studies provide important insights regarding the two-way relationship
between multinationals and linkages. Markusen and Venables (1999) note
that the entry of multinationals can have profound effects on backward link-
ages, industrial development, and welfare of the host country if such entry
impacts the structure of imperfectly competitive industries. In fact, one can
make a stronger statement: Since multinationals operate mostly in oligopolis-
tic industries (see Markusen, 1995), their entry must have substantial effects
on local market structure, especially in small developing countries. In the
4Pack and Saggi (2001) study vtt but their analysis assumes that the multinational
cannot contractually prevent its suppliers from serving other firms.
4
models of Rodriguez-Clare (1996) and Markusen and Venables (1999) the
intermediate goods sector is monopolistically competitive so that foreign
investment alters incentives for entry into such markets. In both models,
Ethier's (1982) formulation of the so called love-of-variety production func-
tion for final goods, which is in turn derived from Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), is
at the heart of the interaction between multinationals and local suppliers. By
contrast, we consider an environment where further entry into intermediate
production is ruled out and the multinational's entry affects strategic inter-
action amongst suppliers and final good producers, as well as local market
structure (the delinking effect).
Both Rodriguez-Clare (1996) and Markusen and Venables (1999) empha-
size demand creation effects of multinationals on the host economy: multina-
tionals generate derived demand for intermediate goods, thereby promoting
local industrial development. In addition, the Markusen and Venables model
also allows for a competition effect wherein the entry of a multinational hurts
its local rivals.5 Our model focuses on the supply-side effects of multination-
als on local suppliers, although the demand creation and competition effects
are also present in our model.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the
model, including the benchmark case of auraky. Section 3 examines the
subgame of market interaction and it highlights the demand creation effect
of the multinational's entry. In Sections 4, entry via an exclusive contract is
studied. Section 5 derives the subgame perfect equilibrium of the entire game
while section 6 focuses on the effects of exclusivity on backward linkages and
local welfare in the case with two local suppliers. Section 7 concludes.
5In Rodriguez-Clare (1996), the host country is assumed to be in a `bad' equilibrium
where the final good is produced only by multinationals. As a result, the competition
effect is absent in his model (which has substantial richness along other dimensions).
5
2 Model
There are n  1 local producers of the final product, indexed by j, where
j = 1, ..., n. One unit of the final good requires one unit of an intermediate
good. The intermediate good is produced at unit cost cI
> 0 by m  2 firms
indexed by i, where i = 1...m. From hereon, intermediate good producers are
called `suppliers' and final good producers are called just `producers'. The
marginal cost of a producer equals the sum of the price of the intermediate
good and the unit cost of transforming the input into the final product (given
by c > 0). The demand for the final good is assumed to be linear p = a - Q
and all firms are assumed to compete in the Cournot fashion (at both the
upstream and downstream levels).
Our interest lies in examining the effects of the entry of a multinational
firm (who produces the final good) on domestic industry. The multinational's
marginal cost of transforming the intermediate good is (1 - )c, where  
[0, 1] measures the degree of its cost-advantage over local producers.6 As
a benchmark, we first describe market equilibrium in the absence of the
multinational.
2.1 The benchmark case: autarky
Prior to the entry by the multinational (referred to as autarky), producers
and suppliers are linked in the following way: All producers buy the interme-
diate good via the open market wherein all suppliers compete. Denote the
price of the intermediate by w.
Given w, Cournot competition between local producers yields the aggre-

Q =

n + 1
, i = 1, ..., n. (1)
From above, the derived demand for the intermediate equals

Q. (2)
Competition among suppliers yields the following equilibrium output of a
typical supplier:
qA
i
=
n
(m + 1)(n + 1)
, i = 1, ..., m (3)
where   a - c - cI
> 0. Substituting the equilibrium quantities into
the demand equation for the intermediate yields the equilibrium price of the
intermediate:
wA =

m + 1
+ cI
, (4)
The profit of each supplier is easily calculated:
A
i
= (wA - cI
)qA
i
=

(m + 1)2(n + 1)

Similarly, the profit of each producer equals:

= (a - mqi
- c - wA)
mqA

=

(m + 1)2(n + 1)2
. (6)
Let the aggregate level of output of the intermediate good measure the degree
of backward linkages (BLA) under autarky:
BLA = mqA
i
=
mn
(m + 1)(n + 1)
(7)
To explore the effects of the multinational's entry on local industry we now
study an entry game wherein the multinational's choice regarding the mode
of interaction with its local suppliers is endogenous.
7
2.2 Entry by the multinational firm
Upon its entry, the multinational competes with local producers in supplying
the final product. We assume that the multinational does not import the
intermediate from abroad and sources it locally. Such local sourcing might
arise because of technological reasons (such as high transportation costs or
the costs of relying on far away suppliers) or due to policy restrictions (such as
local content requirements imposed by the government in the host country).7
Furthermore, as Rodriguez-Clare (1996) notes, producer services (such as
banking, auditing, consulting, wholesale services, transportation, machine
repair etc.) are nontradable goods and proximity between suppliers and
producers is essential. In any case, our focus is on how the multinational is
linked with local suppliers, given that it sources the intermediate locally.
The sequence of moves is as follows:
· First, the multinational chooses between two alternatives (i) an arms
length arrangement with its suppliers (i.e. market interaction) wherein
it simply buys the intermediate from the market as an anonymous buyer
and (ii) a contractual relationship that involves vertical technology
transfer (vtt) from the multinational to its suppliers . In exchange for
vtt, the selected suppliers agree to serve the multinational exclusively
(ex).
· If a contractual relationship is chosen, the multinational approaches k
suppliers called `invited suppliers', with the offer (vtt, ex).
· Then, the invited suppliers simultaneously decide whether or not to ac-
cept the multinational's offer. Let S(k) denote the number of suppliers
7See Qiu and Tao (2001) for an analysis of local content requirements when the final
good market is oligopolistic.
8
that accept the multinational's offer.
· Fourth, the multinational carries out vtt to its suppliers. The other
m - S(k) suppliers serve local producers with their old technologies.
Payoffs of all parties equal their respective Cournot profits given market
structure. If no suppliers accept the multinational's offer (i.e. S(k) =
0), then all firms engage in anonymous market interaction.
We model vtt as a reduction in the marginal cost of the supplier from cI
to cI
-d where the parameter d captures the degree of vtt. Alternatively, we
can interpret vtt as an improvement in the quality of the intermediate good.
Specifically, with the help of the multinational, the product quality of local
suppliers is improved so that one-unit of the intermediate becomes equivalent
to  units where   1. This means that a typical supplier's marginal cost
of producing one effective unit of the intermediate becomes cI

. Clearly, the
reduction in the supplier's cost equals d = (1 - 1/)cI
.
We next derive the subgame perfect equilibrium of the entry game, using
the standard backward induction procedure.
3 Market interaction and demand creation
Under market interaction, the multinational sources the intermediate locally
and all producers buy the intermediate good in the open market at the price
w.8 Given w, downstream Cournot competition yields the following quanti-
ties for the multinational and the local producers:
qf
=
a - c + (n + 1)c - w
n + 2
and qj
=
a - c - c - w
n + 2
, j = 1...n. (8)
8This assumption is standard in the literature and allows a comparison of our results
with those of Markusen and Venables (1999) and Rodriguez-Clare (1996).
9
The derived demand for the intermediate equals
Q = qf
+ nqj
 w = a - c +
c
n + 1
-
n + 2
n + 1
Q. (9)
Comparing the above equation with equation (2), shows that the multina-
tional's entry raises the derived demand for the intermediate through two
channels. First, the number of producers increases from n to n + 1 thereby
increasing the total output of the final product (as well as the quantity de-
manded of the intermediate -- i.e. the demand creation effect). Such demand
creation is evident in the fact the derived demand for the intermediate be-
comes flatter relative to autarky (its slope decreases from -(n + 1)/n to
-(n + 2)/(n + 1)). The second channel through which the multinational
raises demand for the intermediate is through its technological advantage
(c) over local producers and this is captured by the term c/(n+1) in equa-
tion (9). Because of this cost-advantage, the multinational producers a larger
quantity than its local rivals. However, the flip side of this cost-advantage
effect is the competition effect that is reflected in the decrease in the output
of each local producer. Furthermore, the larger is  the greater the reduction
in local producers' outputs. However, the aggregate output level increases
with . Note that the magnitudes of the competition and cost-advantage
effects are negatively related to the number of local producers n.
The following observation is useful in understanding some of the results
derived later in the paper.
Remark 1: The demand creation effect of the multinational's entry de-
creases with the number of local producers (n).
Given the derived demand for the intermediate good, the Cournot output
level of a typical supplier equals

(n + 1) + c
(n + 2)(m + 1)

As under autarky, the degree of backward linkages in the economy under
market interaction equals BLM = mqM

BLM - BLA = m(qM

m[ + (n + 1)c]
(m + 1)(n + 2)(n + 1)
> 0. (14)
Proposition 1: When the multinational buys the intermediate good via
the market, its entry increases the degree of backward linkages in the local
industry relative to autarky.
Consider next how the multinational's entry under an exclusive contract
affects local industry.
4 Exclusive contract
Under an exclusive contractual relationship, local suppliers are divided into
two groups: those who supply the multinational only and those who supply
local producers only. Without of loss of generality, suppose that the 1...k
supply the multinational while k + 1...m supply local producers. While the
suppliers of the multinational are delinked from the rest of the local final
good producers, they receive vtt from the multinational. Let wf
and wh
11
denote the unit prices of the intermediate paid by the multinational and
local producers respectively. Given these prices, the multinational's marginal
cost of production equals wf
+ (1 - )c while that of local producers equals
wh
+ c. Under Cournot competition downstream, the equilibrium output of
the multinational equals
qf
=
a - c + (n + 1)c - (n + 1)wf
+ nwh
n + 2
(15)
while that of a typical local producer equals
qj
=
a - c - c - 2wh
+ wf
n + 2
for j = 1...n. (16)
Rewriting the above two equations in terms of prices gives the derived
demands from the multinational and local producers respectively:
wf

j=k+1
qj
and wh

-
n + 1

qj
. (17)
Below, we first derive the market equilibrium for given k, and then explore
the optimal k for the multinational.
4.1 Market equilibrium under exclusivity
A typical supplier to the multinational solves the following problem:
Max
qi
[wf

+ d]qi
for i = 1...k (18)
whereas a typical supplier to local producers solves:
Max
qi
[wh
- cI
]qi
for i = k + 1...m. (19)
where the demand functions for the intermediate are given by equation (17).
The total amount of intermediate supplied to the multinational equals Qf

and that supplied to local producers equals Qh

Let the equilibrium output of a supplier that caters to the multinational equal
qEX
m
while that of a supplier that caters to local firms equal qEX
h
. Thus, the
above first order conditions become
 + d + c = 2(k + 1)qEX
m
+ (m - k)qEX

(22)
and

The solution to the above system is

2(n + 1)(k + 1)(m - k + 1) - k(m - k)n

4.2 Best response of invited suppliers
Once invited, a supplier has two options: either to become an exclusive sup-
plier for the multinational or to serve home producers only. The trade-off
behind this choice is as follows. On the one hand, by serving the multi-
national, a supplier captures a share of the multinational's demand for the
intermediate and also receives vtt from it. On the other hand, it must forego
the option of serving local producers. Whether or not it is profitable for a
supplier to serve the multinational depends on (i) how many other suppliers
accept the multinational's offer; (ii) the extent of vtt; and (iii) and the
magnitude of the intermediate demand generated by local producers. Specif-
ically, given that k - 1 suppliers accept the multinational's offer, the kth
supplier is willing to serve the multinational if and only if
EX
m
(k)  EX
m
(k - 1). (31)
14
Remark 2: The profit of a supplier that accepts the multinational's offer
decreases with k whereas the profit of a supplier that rejects the multinational's
offer increases with k.
The intuition behind the above result is simple: As more suppliers switch
to serving the multinational exclusively, competition among them intensifies
whereas competition among those that supply local producers declines.
Let k be the largest integer that satisfies (31). Obviously, such k is unique
and in general is between 0 and m. If the multinational announces a k that is
smaller than (or equal to) k, then all invited suppliers accept its offer because
(31) holds. If k  k + 1, then (31) is violated at k by the definition of k so
that the kth supplier, even if invited, will choose to reject the offer and stay
as a supplier of home producers. We thus have the following result.
Lemma 1: Given the k announced by the multinational, its equilibrium
number of exclusive suppliers S(k) is as follows:
S(k) =
½
k, if k  k
k, if k > k.
¾
(32)
Although we cannot obtain an analytical expression for k, it is easy to
show that it increases with the degree of vtt (d), as well as the technological
gap between the multinational and its local rivals (). In fact, as d or  rises,
function EX
m
(k) shifts upwards and function EX
m
(k - 1) shifts downwards,
implying that k goes up. Intuitively, for larger d or , the option of becoming
an exclusive supplier to the multinational becomes more attractive, leading
a larger number of suppliers to accept the exclusivity offer.
To preclude the uninteresting case that all suppliers become the exclusive
suppliers of the multinational thereby driving all local producers out of the
market, we make the following assumption which guarantees that k  m-1.
Assumption 1: EX
h
(m - 1) > EX
m
(m).
15
The right-hand-side in the above assumption EX
m
(m) is the Cournot
profit of a supplier when the multinational is the only producer of the final
good.9 This assumption says that a supplier prefers to be the sole supplier to
all local producers than to serve the multinational exclusively (together with
all other m - 1 suppliers). Assumption 1 requires that (d + c)/ be not too
big ­ in other words, the technological advantage of the multinational over
its local rivals and the degree of vtt be not too large relative to the local
market size.
Using the expression for EX
h
(m - 1), Assumption 1 can be written as
n + 1

(33)
Similarly, to make exclusivity an attractive option for suppliers, the fol-
lowing assumption is necessary (it ensures that k  1):
Assumption 2: EX

. (34)
The right-hand-side of the inequality EX
h
(0) is the profit of a typical
supplier under market interaction (see equation (11)) -- i.e. when no supplier
accepts the multinational's offer whereas EX
m
(1) is the profit of a supplier
when it is the only one serving the multinational. Assumption 2 implies
that once the multinational offers (vtt, ex) to certain suppliers, it is not
a Nash equilibrium for all of those suppliers to reject the offer; at least one
will choose to accept the offer. Assumption 2 holds, for example, if d is not
too small.
9Derivation of this profit is straightforward. One way to obtain it is to substitute n = 1
into the supplier's profit function in the case of autarky derived in section 2.
16
Since EX
f
(k) is an increasing function of k, the multinational would an-
nounce k = k and, by Lemma 1, earn a profit of EX
f
(k) under exclusivity.
Lemma 2: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold. Then, the optimal strategy
for the multinational, given that it chooses exclusivity, is to set k = k and
its equilibrium profit equals EX
f
(k). 10
5 Equilibrium mode of entry
Regarding the choice between an exclusive contractual arrangement or mar-
ket interaction, the basic trade-off facing the multinational is as follows.
First, exclusivity prevents the multinational's local rivals from enjoying the
benefits of vtt that the multinational undertakes to its suppliers. Second,
by its very nature, exclusivity limits the number of competing suppliers that
serve the multinational's local rivals. Both of these advantages raise the
costs of the multinational's rivals. The disadvantage of exclusivity is that
the multinational is able to attract only k suppliers under exclusivity while
it buys the intermediate in an open market where all m suppliers compete
with one another. One thus naturally expects that either exclusive contract
or market interaction can be optimal for the multinational firm depending
on parameter values. Clearly, exclusivity occurs in the subgame perfect equi-
librium of the entry game if and only if   EX
f
(k) - M
f
 0.
Since protection of vtt is the primary reason for the choice of exclusive
contract by the multinational, exclusivity becomes more attractive the larger
the extent of vtt. In fact, because EX
f
(k) increases with d and k, and the
number of equilibrium suppliers of the multinational (k) also rises with d, the
10Strictly speaking, any announcement k by the multinational where k  k would
constitute an equilibrium. However, if conveying the extent of vtt to a potential supplier
incurred even a minute cost (say  > 0 where  is arbitrarily small), the multinational
would not approach more than k suppliers.
17
profit differential  increases as d goes up. Noting that M
f
is independent of
d (there is no vtt under market interaction), we have that  > 0 if and only
if d exceeds a threshold. Assume that there exists d such that |d=d
= 0.11
Proposition 2: The multinational firm opts for an exclusive contract
if and only if the extent of vtt undertaken by it is sufficiently large (i.e.
d > d).
An important parameter of the model is the magnitude of the multina-
tional firm's cost advantage in transforming the intermediate good into the
final product (). If  rises, both EX
f
(k) and M
f
go up. So in general it is not
clear whether exclusivity becomes more or less attractive with an increase in
. For the case with two suppliers considered in the next section, it is shown
that exclusivity is less likely to occur for larger .
How does exclusivity affects the degree of backward linkages, consumer
surplus and local welfare? As mentioned earlier, the multinational's entry
with exclusive contract impacts local industry in three ways: (i) it increases
competition downstream and this tends to raise the level of backward linkages
(and thus consumer surplus); (ii) de-linking reduces the degree of competi-
tion among suppliers which tends to lower the aggregate output level of the
intermediate good (as well as consumer surplus); and (iii) local suppliers
benefit from vtt, which tends to raise the level of backward linkages. The
net effect of the three forces can either be negative or positive -- we explore
these three effects in greater detail below for the case of two local suppliers..
Local producers are affected in two separate ways by the multinational's
entry under exclusivity. First, their market shares decline due to increased
competition from a more efficient producer. Second, local producers suffer
11If such a d does not exist, then  is either always negative or positive and such cases
are of limited interest.
18
also from the decline in the number of suppliers who serve them. The delink-
ing of k producers changes market structure of the two-tier industry and
raises the market power of the m - k suppliers who serve local producers.12
How do suppliers fare under exclusivity relative to autarky? Since the
equilibrium number of suppliers serving the multinational (k) cannot be
solved for analytically in the general case, we are unable to derive general
analytical results regarding the effects on suppliers. However, in the special
case of upstream duopoly (considered in the next section), we show that the
supplier who serves the multinational is better off and the other supplier
is worse off relative to autarky. Nevertheless, the average profit of the two
suppliers exceeds the profit of a typical supplier under autarky.
6 Two local suppliers
To further explore the choice between the two contracting arrangements, this
section considers the case of two local suppliers (i.e. m = 2). First note that,
if the multinational opts for exclusivity, then under Assumptions 1 and 2 in
the previous section the equilibrium number of exclusive suppliers is one (i.e.
k = 1). From derivations in the previous section, the equilibrium quantities
for the two suppliers (where 1 serves the multinational and 2 serves local
firms) are:
qEX
1
=
(n + 2) + 2(n + 1)(d + c)
7n + 8
and qEX
2
=
3n - n(d + c)
7n + 8
. (35)
12To see this, note from (30) that a local producer's profit declines with k. Thus,
EX
j
(k) < EX
j
|k=0
=
m22
(m + 1)2(n + 1)2
.
The right-hand-side of the above equation equals the profit of a local producer under
autarky.

Straightforward comparison of intermediate good prices shows the follow-
ing:13
wEX
f
< wEX
h
 (n - 1) + (2n + 3)d > 5(n + 1)c.
Remark 3: Under exclusivity, the multinational pays a lower price for
the intermediate good than other local producers if vtt is substantial (i.e. d
is large) or if its cost advantage over local competitors is not too large (i.e.
 is small).
Obviously, vtt lowers the unit cost of suppliers of multinational and thus
tends to reduce the intermediate price for the multinational. An increase
in the cost-advantage of the multinational in transforming the intermediate
13Comparing (36) with (4), we can show that wEX
h
> wA if d + c is not too big.
Thus, the multinational's entry under exclusivity can raise the costs of local producers by
lowering the number of suppliers who serve local producers. By contrast, when d + c is
large, the market shares of local producers is small and their demand for the intermediate
good is low. Under such a scenario, the multinational's entry can actually lower the price
they pay for the intermediate relative to autarky.
20
good erodes the market share of a typical local producer, thereby lowering
its demand for the intermediate good.
Exclusivity occurs in equilibrium if and only if it is more profitable for the
multinational firm relative to market interaction: i.e., if and only if EX

Taking partial derivatives of  with respect  yields the following result.
Lemma 3: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold and m=2. Then, the
larger the cost-advantage of the multinational over its local competitors, the
weaker its incentive to choose an exclusive contract over market interaction
( 

< 0).
This result can be understood as follows. If the multinational possesses
a larger cost-advantage () in transforming the intermediate good into the
final product, then it is less worried about protecting its vtt and is more
concerned about creating competition among its suppliers. As a result, the
multinational is more likely to prefer market interaction.
To concentrate on the role of vtt, we next consider the case where the
multinational has no direct cost advantage over its local rivals ( = 0).

which always holds as long as n  2. If n = 1, then (41) holds if and only if
d/  1/12.
21
Proposition 3: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold (so k = 1), m=2,
and  = 0. Then, the following hold:
(i) If n  2 then exclusivity always occurs in equilibrium; and
(ii) If n=1 then exclusivity arises iff the extent of vtt is sufficiently
large (i.e. d/ > 1/12).
If n = 1, the local industry is a double duopoly after the entry of the
multinational. When the extent of vtt is large (d/ > 1/12), the benefit of
preventing its suppliers from serving its local rival is high so that exclusivity
is a better choice. By contrast, when vtt is minor the multinational prefers
market interaction so as to enjoy more competition among suppliers. If the
number of rival producers of the multinational exceeds 2, the incentive to
prevent vtt to leak to its downstream rival firms dominates the incentive
to create competition among suppliers so that the multinational opts for
exclusivity.
We next focus on the case that exclusivity emerges in equilibrium ( n  2)
and examine its effects on the local economy.
6.1.1 Effects of exclusivity on local industry
As mentioned for the general case, local producers are certainly worse off
under exclusivity relative to autarky because of competition from the multi-
national as well as due to reduction of competition among suppliers.
For suppliers, Assumption 2 guarantees that supplier 1 is better off rela-
tive to market interaction and thus is better off relative to autarky as well.
For supplier 2, straightforward comparison of EX
2
and A
2
shows that sup-
plier 2 is better off under exclusivity if and only if d/ < (2n + 1)/(3n + 3).
Thus, if vtt to supplier 1 is not significant, supplier 2 gains from the multi-
national's entry under an exclusive contract with supplier 1. But if vtt is
22
substantial, then the multinational commands too large a market share, lead-
ing to a sharp decline in the derived demand facing supplier 2. In such a
case, supplier 2 is worse off relative to autarky.
Recall that at the contracting stage of the game where the multinational
selects suppliers, the equilibrium probability of a supplier being invited to
become an exclusive supplier to the multinational equals k/m (which in the
present case equals1/2). Thus, the average profits of a typical supplier in the
two-supplier case equals

It is easy to show that the above average profit is an increasing function of
d and that µ

Lemma 4: Suppose m=2, n  2, and  = 0. A typical supplier earns
greater expected profit under the multinational's entry with exclusivity relative
to autarky.
This result is consistent with both case-study evidence and formal econo-
metric investigations of the effects of multinational firms on local suppliers
(see Moran, 1998 for an overview of such evidence; also Javorcik, 2004).
6.1.2 Backward linkages and local welfare under exclusivity
As under autarky, the degree of backward linkages here can be measured by
aggregate output
BLEX = qEX
1
+ qEX
2
=
(4n + 2) + (n + 2)d
7n + 8
(42)
Comparing to autarky, we have that the multinational's entry raises the
degree of backward linkages (i.e., BLEX > BLA) if and only if
d

>
2(n2 - n - 3)
3(n + 1)(n + 2)
 GBL
(n). (43)
23
That is, for given n, exclusivity increases the level of backward linkages if
and only if vtt or the cost-advantage of the multinational exceeds a critical
value (Proposition 2). Furthermore, the critical value, GBL
(n), increases with
n, so that for lager n, it is less likely that exclusivity will raise the degree of
backward linkages in the host industry. The intuition for this is that if n is
small, the increase in the derived demand for the intermediate caused by the
multinational's entry is relatively large. As a result, the level of backward
linkages rises despite the de-linking effect caused by exclusivity. If n is big,
on the other hand, the market share of the multinational is small after its
entry. This implies that the extra demand for the intermediate caused by
such entry is small. In fact, it is so small that it cannot offset the negative
effect on backward linkages generated by exclusivity.

that at least one supplier prefers to be the sole supplier of local producers
than to serve the multinational exclusively along with the other supplier, is
equivalent to

For a supplier to be willing to accept the exclusivity offer, the extent of
vtt must be large enough. Function G2
(n) represents the vtt threshold
for given n. As noted earlier, a larger n implies a higher opportunity cost of
serving the foreign exclusively. As a result, G2
(n) increases with n.
Figure 1 illustrates the effects of the multinational's entry on backward
linkages and local welfare in the (n, d

) space.
­ Figure 1 here ­
Assumptions 1 and 2 require that the feasible parameter values lie below
G1
(n) and above G2
(n). Within the feasible region, Figure 1 can be divided
into four areas labelled as I, II, III, and IV. In region IV, the extent of vtt
is so large that the multinational's entry raises both the level of backward
linkages and local welfare. In region II, however, the multinational's entry
lowers both the level of backward linkages and local welfare. For the other
two areas, the degree of backward linkages and welfare do not move in the
same direction: in region III the multinational's entry raises local welfare
even as it lowers the degree of backward linkages but, whereas the opposite
is true in region I.
The intuition for why the multinational's entry enhances both backward
linkages and local welfare in region IV is simple: If vtt is substantial, the
multinational's entry is beneficial to the host country despite the negative
effects of exclusivity. Likewise, if the extent of vtt is low and local market
structure downstream is relatively competitive (i.e. n is big), such as in
25
region II, the negative effect of exclusivity dominates the positive effects of
demand creation and vtt, in which case both local welfare and the level of
backward linkages decline due to the multinational's entry.
For the other two areas (I and III), the multinational's entry increases
either local welfare or the level of backward linkages (but not both), depend-
ing on the value of n. If n is small and vtt is not very substantial (region
I), backward linkages increase but welfare declines. This is because when
n is small, the demand creation effect of the multinational's entry is large
(as noted in Remark 1) and the resulting increase in the output of the in-
termediate good translates into higher consumer surplus as well and greater
profits of suppliers. However, for small n, the market is concentrated and the
erosion of the profits of local firms that results from entry is large and this
negative effect on local producers leads to a reduction in local welfare. Area
III can be similarly understood: If n is large and vtt is moderate, backward
linkages decrease but local welfare increases with entry. The negative effect
on backward linkages stems from the fact that the demand-creation effect of
entry is weak when n is large. Local welfare increases despite the reduction
in backward linkages because the benefits of vtt dominate the losses of local
producers. The following proposition highlights the possible negative effect
of exclusivity:
Proposition 4: Suppose assumptions 1 and 2 hold, m = 2, and  = 0.
Then, there exist parameter values for which the multinational firm chooses
to enter with an exclusive contract and its entry lowers the level of backward
linkages (ranges II and III in Figure 1).
26
7 Conclusion
The model developed in this paper differs from existing literature on back-
ward linkages in two main respects. First, while existing literature focuses
on the demand-creating effects of the entry of multinational firms on local
industry (e.g. Markusen and Venables, 1999), we focus on the supply-side
effects of such entry. In particular, vtt and the possibility of exclusive con-
tract between the multinational and its local suppliers are two key ingredients
of our model. Existing literature has given us important insights regarding
the scenario where multinationals purchase required intermediates via the
market. However, such research, by design cannot shed light on issues that
surface once the contractual options available to the multinational are con-
sidered. For example, an important insight of our model is that while vtt is
beneficial for the local economy, it comes at an implicit price when accompa-
nied with exclusivity: under such a contractual arrangement the recipients
of vtt are no longer able to supply local producers they supplied prior to
the entry of the multinational.
Our second point of departure from existing literature is that our model
considers oligopolistic competition at both the upstream and downstream
stages of production. Such a setting enables us to examine how the contrac-
tual relationship between the multinational and its suppliers affects strategic
interaction in the local industry. For example, in addition to the competition
effect identified in Markusen and Venables (1999), entry by the multinational
into the final good market also hurts its local rivals through a delinking effect:
When exclusivity arises in equilibrium, local producers lose some of their old
suppliers to the multinational. Put differently, while the entry of the multi-
national does create additional demand for the intermediate good, it may
also reduce the number of suppliers available to its local rivals. This nega-
27
tive supply side effect can dominate the positive demand side effects so that
the total output of the intermediate good (as well as the final good) shrinks
due to the multinational's entry. Our model identifies delinking as another
channel, in addition to importing of intermediate goods as recognized in the
literature, via which foreign direct investment may lower industrial linkages
in the host country. However, it is worth noting that the entry of the multi-
national even under exclusivity increases aggregate local welfare (and the
degree of backward linkages) so long as the degree of vtt is not too small .
The model focuses on the entry decision of a single multinational and does
not consider competition amongst multinationals. Further research is needed
to determine how strategic competition amongst multinationals affects their
incentives to impose exclusivity conditions on their local suppliers.
