Merger & Acquisition and Capital
Expenditure in Health Care: Information
Gleaned From Stock Price Variation
Wenjing Ouyang, PhD1 and Peter E. Hilsenrath, PhD1
Abstract
Investment, especially through merger and acquisition (M&A), is a leading topic of concern among health care managers. In
addition, the implications of this activity for organization and market concentration are of great interest to policy makers.
Using a sample of 2256 firm-year observations in the health care industry during the period from 1985 to 2011, this
article provides novel evidence that managers learn from financial markets in making capital expenditure (CAPEX) and M&A
investment decisions. Within the industry, managers in the Drugs subsector are most likely to do so, whereas managers
in the Medical Equipment and Supplies are least likely to do so. We find informative stock prices improve firm financial
performance. This article highlights the importance of financial markets for real economic activity in the health care industry.

Introduction
Investors collect, analyze, and interpret firm-related infor-
mation to create their own private firm-specific information.
This information can be about the demand for the firm's
products or about strategic issues, such as competition with
other firms.1 Informed investors trade on their private firm-
specific information so that this information is stored in
stock prices as stock price firm-specific information.2 The
first present direct evidence that managers learn from this
information is in capital expenditure (CAPEX) decisions.1
Stock price firm-specific information significantly increases
the sensitivity of CAPEX to Tobin's Q, the stock price­based
measure of the value of firm fundamentals, suggesting that
stock price firm-specific information provides managers new
information in their decision making. In other words, manag-
ers learn from financial markets.1
Some may wonder why outside investors possess firm-
specific information that managers, who run the business
daily, do not have. We do not argue that managers know less
than outside investors do. However, it is possible that manag-
ers do not possess every piece of information related to firm
valuation. A firm's valuation depends not only on internal
information about business operations but also on external
information, such as the state of the economy, the position of
competitors, the demand by consumers, and so on.3 Outside
investors discipline the market and related information can
be useful to managers. Stock prices aggregate many inves-
tors' information offering considerable firm-specific infor-
mation not known by managers.
Recently, the stream of literature about manager learning
from financial markets has grown rapidly. It extends from
CAPEX to cash savings, dividend payments, seasoned equity
issuance, labor investment, and M&A investment.4-10 These
studies argue that when stock prices reflect more firm-spe-
cific information, managers make corporate decisions that
are more aligned with the value of firm fundamentals and
therefore achieve higher operating performance. Among all
these studies on stock price informativeness, no such study
has focused on a particular industry. This article aims to fill
this gap with a health care focus.
Our research question is whether managers in the health
care industry learn from financial markets in making
investment decisions. Insider trading is widely understood,
but we explore what in some respects is the reverse of insider
trading, where public information is profitably employed by

private parties. We not only examine CAPEX investments
but also investments through M&A deals. The article goes
beyond reporting health care specific financial analysis. It is
translational research with the objective of informing the
health care management community of relevant develop-
ments in the field of academic finance. It is an effort to cross-
fertilize the silos that too often divide us.
Using a sample of 2256 firm-year observations during the
period from 1985 to 2011, we find that stock price firm-spe-
cific information increases the sensitivity of both CAPEX
and M&A to Tobin's Q. The results provide novel industry-
level evidence to the literature that managers in the health
care industry learn from financial markets. As the health care
industry is heterogeneous and includes important subsectors,
we split the industry into 3 subsectors--Drugs, Health
Services, and Medical Equipment and Supplies. We find that
in the Drugs subsector, both CAPEX and M&A investment
increase sensitivity to Q when stock prices are more informa-
tive. However, this relation holds in M&Ainvestment only in
Health Services and does not hold at all in Medical Equipment
and Supplies. After comparing firm characteristics, we find
that firms in the Drugs subsector have the highest stock price
firm-specific information and least managerial private infor-
mation. Therefore, managers in a better information environ-
ment are more likely to believe the information creation
ability of financial markets. In addition, Drug firms are much
larger than those in the other 2 subsectors, which may moti-
vate managers to learn from the market.
This article is the first to address managerial learning
from financial markets in the health care industry. Financial
markets bridge managers with investors who do not always
have direct communication with management. Previous
studies show that inside managers possess more firm-spe-
cific information and information flows from inside manag-
ers to outside investors through announcement of
firm-specific issues such as earnings announcements and
equity issuance.11,12 We argue that the information flow can
also be the other way around from outside investors to inside
managers. Possessing more complete knowledge from finan-
cial markets can help health care managers improve decision
making.
Data and Methods
We begin our sample collection from the entire universe of
stocks found in COMPUSTAT/Center for Research in
Security Prices (CRSP) database. We define the health care
industry using the health care industry classification in
Fama-French 12 industry definition. Furthermore, we define
subsectors following the Standard Industrial Code (SIC) def-
inition in the SIC Manual from US Department of Labor
online resource. We use SIC codes 2833 to 2836 to define the
Drugs subsector. This includes the following nomenclature:
Medicinal Chemicals & Botanical Products, Pharmaceutical
Preparations, In Vitro & In Vivo Diagnostic Substances, and
Biological Products. SIC codes 3841 to 3845 are used to
define Medical Equipment and Supplies. The nomenclature
here includes the following: Surgical & Medical Instruments
& Apparatus Orthopedic, Prosthetic & Surgical Appliances
& Supplies, Dental Equipment & Supplies, X-RayApparatus
& Tubes & Related Irradiation Apparatus, and Electro
Medical & Electrotherapeutic Apparatus. SIC codes 8000 to
8099 define Health Services. This nomenclature includes the
following: Offices & Clinics of Doctors of Medicine;
Nursing & Personal Care Facilities; Skilled Nursing Care
Facilities; Hospitals; Medical Laboratories; Home Health
Care; Misc. Health & Allied Services, NEC; and Specialty
Outpatient Facilities, NEC. These 3 subsectors compose the
health care industry. Firms with negative capital expenditure
or negative acquisition are excluded as are those with less
than $10 million book value. To avoid extreme values, firms
withTobin's Q greater than 100 or less than zero are excluded.
Table 1 lists the sample distribution and descriptive statistics
for the sample of 2256 firm-year observations in the health
care industry during the period 1985 to 2011.
We measure M&A investment with COMPUSTAT item
129 and measure CAPEX investment using COMPUSTAT
item 128.1,13 The main measure of stock price firm-specific
information is stock return nonsynchronicity (). It equals
log [(1 - R2) / R2], where R2 derives from specification (1):
R R R R R R
it ft mt ft jt ft it
- = + × -
( )+ × -
( )+
    , (1)
where R
it
is firm i's daily stock return, R
ft
is the daily risk-free
return measured by the 1-month Treasury bill rate, R
mt
is the
daily market value-weighted return on all New York Stock
Exchange (NYSE), American Stock Exchange (AMEX), and
National Association of Security Dealers Automated
Quotations (NASDAQ) stocks (from CRSP), and R
jt
is the
daily value-weighted return of the SIC 3-digit industry.
This model is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
controlling for industry return. It splits the variation of a
stock return into 3 components: a market-related variation,
an industry-related variation, and a firm-specific variation.
As prices move in response to new information, stock price
movements should reflect new market, industry, and firm-
specific information. Under the standard theoretical frame-
work of the Efficient Market Hypothesis, price movements
should reflect all related information. If there is no public
news announcement of any kind about a firm, its stock price
movements are completely attributable to market and indus-
try news. That is, the R2 of the specification (1) shall be 1.
However, the R2 increases marginally when excluding dates
when firm-specific news is publicly released, indicating that
stock return nonsynchronicity (1 - R2) may reflect investors'
private firm-specific information.2 Empirical evidence pro-
vides strong support that stock return nonsynchronicity
increases with informed trading profit and decreases with
information collection and trading cost, suggesting that it
Ouyang and Hilsenrath 3
proxies for investors'private firm-specific information about
the value of firm fundamentals.14-16
As (1 - R2) is skewed, we employ logistic transformation
of the ratio (1 - R2) / R2.17 Recent studies employ similar
measures of stock return nonsynchronicity to proxy for stock
price firm-specific information.6,14,16-22 We require at least
100 daily stock return observations during the last fiscal year
to ensure explanatory power. One concern of our study is
whether the primary results are sensitive to the particular
measure of stock price informativeness. In unreported tests,
we rerun the regressions using the stock return nonsyn-
chronicity including Fama-French 3 factors and the momen-
tum factor in the market model or including lagged market
and industry returns in the model. We also employ the mea-
sure when cumulating the returns in days where no trading
took place to account for infrequent trading of daily fre-
quency returns. Our results hold when using these alternative
measures.
Tobin's Q is measured as the ratio of market-to-book
value of assets. The market value of assets is comprised of
the value of assets in place and the present value of growth
opportunities. If Tobin's Q is greater than 1, it suggests that
the firm has positive net present value growth opportunities.
Therefore, higher Tobin's Q suggests a firm has more growth
opportunities. The Q-theory of investment argues that the
firm's investment rate should rise with its Q.23 M&A is

investment through purchase of second-hand assets from the
target firm and empirical neoclassical studies report that
these investments also increase with Q.13,24
Because M&A investment can be initiated by manage-
rial private information, we control for managerial private
information with earnings' surprise data.1,11,12 This variable
is defined as the average of absolute abnormal return (-1,
+1) around previous 4 quarterly earnings announcements.
A positive absolute earnings' surprise reveals that there is
some information in earnings not fully anticipated by the
market and hence not held in prices yet. Because managers
presumably know the accounting numbers beforehand, the
earnings' surprise can be a reasonable measure of manage-
rial private information. We control for firm size since
smaller firms tend to have higher stock return nonsyn-
chronicity and they are less likely to have resources other
than equity to finance large acquisitions. We need to address
the concern that our main results are not driven by the firm
size effect. We also include controls of firm leverage and
cash holdings as high leverage can lead to underinvestment
and excess cash flow can cause over-investment.25,26 All
these variables are measured at the previous fiscal year. The
supplementary material provides a detailed explanation of
each variable.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents basic statistics for the main variables in each
health care subsector as well as in the whole health care
industry. The average M&A investment accounts for 10.55%
of total book assets in the health care industry. Health
Services has the highest M&A investment (11.77%), signifi-
cant at 1% level. The average CAPEX investment accounts
for 5.55% of book assets in the health care industry, much
lower than M&A investment. Among the 3 subsectors,
Health Services has higher CAPEX investment, significant
at 1%. Tobin's Q is highest in the Drugs and lowest in Health
Services, significant at 1%. Stock return nonsynchronicity is
highest in Medical Equipment and Supplies. However, as it
is negatively correlated with firm size (coefficient, -0.66; P
< .01), we split firm size and rank stock return nonsyn-
chronicity into quintiles. The average ranking of stock return
nonsynchronicity in Drugs becomes the highest, and signifi-
cant at 1%. Firms in the Drugs category have the biggest
size, lowest managerial private information, and highest cash
flow. Firms in Medical Equipment and Supplies have the
lowest leverage ratio. It is important to note the heterogene-
ity of the 3 subsectors. The Drugs subsector enjoys patent
protection for much of its revenue and is very much a
for-profit arena. To some extent, this applies to Medical
Equipment and Supplies as well. But Health Services com-
petes differently and includes a substantial nonprofit element
which is not directly observed in this study because of the
nature of our data.
Table 2 presents estimation results from ordinary least
squares (OLS) regressions. Panel A reports the whole sam-
ple. Results show both CAPEX and M&A investments
increase with Q. Stock price informativeness () increases
sensitivity of internal capital investment to Q, suggesting
managers learn from financial markets in making CAPEX
investment. Moreover,  increases sensitivity of M&A
investment to Q, suggesting managers learn from financial
markets in making M&A investment decisions. The coeffi-
cient of managerial private information and Q (AI × Q) is not
statistically significant. The last 3 columns of Table 2 show
total investment also becomes more sensitive to Q because of
higher stock price informativeness.
Panel B in Table 2 shows estimation results in each indus-
try subsector. Due to limited space, we only report the coef-
ficient estimates of  × Q using the same regression models
as in panel A. These regression models are models (3), (6),
and (9). In the Drugs category, findings indicate managers
learn from financial markets in both CAPEX and M&A
investments. This observation is not surprising as Table 1
shows firms in this subsector have the largest size, highest
stock price informativeness, and lowest managerial private
information. Managers in Health Services appear to only
learn from the market in making M&A investment decisions.
Managers tend to be more receptive to financial markets in
making these strategic decisions perhaps because Health
Services has the highest level of M&A investment. In
Medical Equipment and Supplies, stock price informative-
ness does not affect the sensitivity of CAPEX or M&A to Q.
If managers learn from financial markets, we would expect
more informed decisions aligned with firm fundamentals and
improved future firm performance. In Table 3, we test the rela-
tion between stock price firm-specific information and future
operating performance including return-on-asset (ROA), sales
increase, and asset turnover. ROA measures total asset profit-
ability, Sales Increase measures sales revenue growth, andAsset
Turnover measures total asset management efficiency. We did
not use  × Q but  directly because managerial learning should
benefit firm performance for both high and low Q firms. For
high Q firms, managerial learning helps to increase investment
to achieve growth opportunities; for low Q firms, managerial
learning helps to curb overinvestment, which also helps to
improve firm performance. We find that stock price firm-spe-
cific information consistently increases future operating perfor-
mance. This observation is consistent with the managerial
learning argument. In unreported tests, we find that stock price
firm-specific information increases future asset turnover and
ROA, respectively, in Drugs and Health Services, supporting
the argument that manager learning improves future firm per-
formance. In Medical Equipment and Supplies, we find that

learning. Results suggest stock price informativeness affects
future firm performance through channels other than manager
learning from the market.27-29
Conclusions
This article presents new evidence that managers in health
care learn from financial markets in making organizational
decisions about CAPEX and M&A investment. We find both
CAPEX and M&A investment become more sensitive to Q
when stock prices are more informative of firm-specific
information. Results suggest financial markets provide man-
agers new information about the value of firm fundamentals
so that managers are more likely to invest through M&A and
CAPEX when informed stock prices are higher. Further anal-
ysis shows managerial learning from financial markets
improves future firm operating performance. Among the 3
industry subsectors, managers in the Drug subsector are most
likely to learn because firms in this sector have the highest
stock price information and lowest managerial private infor-
mation. Managers in Health Services tend to learn only for
M&A investment. This subsector also has the highest per-
centage of investment through M&A.
There is much concern about consolidation and market
power in health care, especially in the wake of theAffordable
Care Act which facilitates clinical and financial integration.
The purpose of integration is to improve efficiency and
avoid "tragedy of the commons" thought to be behind
poor cost and outcome performance in the United States.30
Unfortunately, integration is also associated with consolida-
tion and higher levels of market power. The result may yield
greater productive efficiency but higher allocative ineffi-
ciency.31,32 Economists and others have been concerned
about social welfare and monopoly since at least the time of
Adam Smith. Yet, most of the related literature, especially in
health care, does not fully explore mechanisms by which
