BACKGROUND: Awareness during anesthesia is uncommon. The number of cases that
are found in one single study are insufficient to identify and estimate the risks, causal
factors and sequelae. One method of studying a large number of cases is to analyze
reports of cases of awareness that have been published in scientific journals.
METHODS: We conducted an electronic search of the literature in the National
Library of Medicine's PubMed database for case reports on "Awareness" and
"Anesthesia" for the time period between 1950 through August, 2005. We also
manually searched references cited in these reports and in other articles on
awareness. We used two surgical control groups for comparative purposes. The
first group in a study by Sebel et al. consisted of patients who did not experience
awareness. The second group, from the 1996 data from the National Survey of
Ambulatory Surgery included patients who received general anesthesia. We also
used data from the National Center for Health Statistics to compare weight and
Body Mass Index.
RESULTS: We compared the data of 271 cases of awareness with 19,504 patients who
did not suffer it. Aware patients were more likely to be females (P  0.05), younger
(P  0.001) and to have cardiac and obstetrics operations (P  0.0001). Only 35%
reported the awareness episode during the stay in the recovery room. They
received fewer anesthetic drugs (P  0.0001), and were more likely to exhibit
episodes of tachycardia and hypertension during surgery (P  0.0001). A much
larger percentage of these patients (52%, P  0.0001) voiced postoperative
complaints related to awareness. Inability to move and feelings such as helpless-
ness, sensation of weakness, and hearing noises and voices were related to the
persistence of complaints such as sleep disturbances and fear about future
anesthetics (P  0.041­0.0003). Twenty-two percent of the patients suffered late
psychological symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Our review suggested light anesthesia and a history of awareness as
risk factors. Obesity and avoidance of nitrous oxide use did not seem to increase the
risk. Light anesthesia was the most common cause. Our findings suggest preven-
tive procedures that may lead to a decrease in the incidence of awareness.
(Anesth Analg 2009;108:527­35)
The term "awareness" during anesthesia, as used in
the anesthesia literature, implies that during a period
of intended general anesthesia, the brain is aroused by
stimuli that are stored in memory for future explicit
recall. Patients who experience awareness will recall
such experiences during a state of inadequate anesthe-
sia.1 Awareness is an uncommon phenomenon, occur-
ring in about 0.1% to 0.2% of cases.2 A recent study,
using the data from hospitals' quality improvement
systems, reported an incidence of 0.007%.3 Prospective
studies have been used to study the incidence of the
event. However, the number of cases that are reported
is insufficient to identify and estimate the risks, causal
factors and sequelae, which need to be known in order
to develop effective preventive measures. In an effort
to recruit more cases, advertising, referral from other
physicians and closed claims analysis have been used.
Myles et al.4 recruited patients undergoing specific
types of surgery, e.g., cardiac and obstetric, which
have an increased incidence of awareness. These
methods still do not provide enough cases and lead to
selection bias, e.g., excessive recruitment of "com-
plainers" and those with financial motives or incen-
tives and restriction to specific types of surgery and
patients. For the alleged victims of awareness who are
identified by these methods, with the exception of
those of the prospective study of Myles et al.,4 remem-
bering the past is not merely a matter of activating or
awakening a dormant trace or picture in mind, but

instead involves a far more complex interaction be-
tween the current environment at the time of investi-
gation, what one expects to remember and what is
retained from the past. Biases and suggestive tech-
niques tilt the balance among these contributors, so
that present influences may play a larger role in
determining what is remembered than what actually
happened.5
One method of studying a large number of aware-
ness cases, much larger than has been done so far, is to
study reports of awareness that have been published
in scientific journals. Case reports have sometimes had
a greater impact on science and clinical practice than
most prospective randomized investigations.6 The re-
port by Scoville and Milner in 19577 of a patient
identified as HM, began the modern study of memory
storage by localizing memory to a specific site in the
brain and provided the first evidence of implicit
memory storage. It became the most cited article in the
field of brain and behavior research. The report by
Winterbottom in 19508 emphasized the danger of
awareness during the use of muscle relaxants as
anesthetic adjuvants, and opened the gate for studies
of awareness. The description by Albright9 of cardiac
deaths after bupivacaine administration alerted the
anesthesia community to the dangerous cardiovascu-
lar toxicity of the drug. There are many other ex-
amples. The American Society of Anesthesiologists
(ASA) recognized very recently the value of case
reports and, in March, 2007, opened an electronic
awareness registry to recruit cases,* with the declared
goal of "gathering detailed and relevant information
with the aim of increasing our knowledge about
intraoperative awareness and its risk factors." Our
review of published cases shares the same goals.
METHODS
We conducted an electronic search of the literature
in the National Library of Medicine's PubMed data-
base for case reports on "Awareness" and "Anesthe-
sia" for the time period between 1950 (when the first
case report was published) through August, 2005. We
also manually searched references cited in these re-
ports and in various articles on awareness. All the
retrieved articles were limited to the English language
and peer-reviewed publications. We excluded publi-
cations devoted to pediatric cases, cases in which a
large part of the data that we wanted to collect were
missing, cases caused by administration of muscle
relaxants in error to an awake patient, cases reporting
only out-of-body experiences (a patient sees his or her
body from a location outside the physical body),
dreams and cases which could only be categorized as
possible as opposed to definite or probable. We col-
lected 271 cases.
The data extracted for each case were the article
authors' names, title, name of the journal, publication
dates, age, gender, race, weight, height, Body Mass
Index (BMI), ASA classification, history of awareness,
history of drug use, premedication, drugs for induction
of anesthesia, difficulty and duration of laryngoscopy
and intubation, drugs for maintenance of anesthesia,
monitors used, autonomic changes during anesthesia,
patient movement, time of awareness, time of report
of awareness, type of operation, patients' complaints
and postoperative sequelae, management of the report
of awareness by the anesthesiologists, and possible
cause of awareness. The materials for each case were
searched by two of the authors (MG and either MH or
MM) to ensure accuracy of the data summary.
We used two surgical control groups for compara-
tive purposes. The first group consisted of 19,504
patients who did not experience awareness in the
study by Sebel et al.,2 which investigated the incidence
of awareness. The data compared for this group
included the patient's age, gender, ASA classification,
premedication, drugs used for induction and mainte-
nance of anesthesia, intraoperative hypertension and/or
tachycardia, type of surgery, and postoperative se-
quelae. Because these data were recent and the aware-
ness case reports spanned many years, we also used,
for comparative purposes, age and gender of patients
who received general anesthesia in the 1996 data from
the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (similar
data are not readily available for hospitalized pa-
tients), and weight and BMI in the 1988­1994 data
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey of the United States household population.
Frequency distributions of qualitative characteris-
tics and means of quantitative characteristics were
derived from the 271 awareness case reports that were
identified. The frequency distribution for each char-
acteristic was based on all cases that provided
information concerning that characteristic, regardless
of whether they lacked data concerning other charac-
teristics. The frequency of missing data for each char-
acteristic was tabulated separately. 2 tests were used
to examine associations of complaints during episodes
of awareness during anesthesia with postoperative
sequelae. Negative binomial regression was used to
examine whether the average numbers of case reports
per year changed over different time periods. From
the fitted model, estimates of the number of cases per
year for each time period were obtained and pairwise
comparisons that compared 1990­99 and 2000­05
with each of the earlier time periods were per-
formed. The level of significance used was   0.05.
The analyses were done with SAS 9.1 for Windows
software.

528 Review of Reported Cases of Awareness ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA
In comparing the data from the awareness case
reports with the three other data sets derived from
Sebel et al.,2 the National Survey of Ambulatory
Surgery, and the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey, the statistical tests used were the
Wilcoxon's ranked sum test for ASA classification, 2
tests for other qualitative characteristics, and t-tests for
quantitative characteristics. For these comparisons,
individuals younger than 20-yr-old were excluded;
there were only two such individuals (1%) among
the awareness case reports. Data from the National
Survey of Ambulatory Surgery and the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were
treated as population values, and, when compared
with the awareness case reports, were matched for
gender when comparing age and for age when com-
paring gender, weight, and BMI. Raw data were used
for the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery. Pub-
lished means were used for the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey; separately for men and
women, we obtained population means for weight
and BMI from this published information by taking
weighted averages of the means over the different age
categories, with the weights corresponding to the
percent distribution by age of the reported cases of
awareness. Because of the time frames of these sources
and the possibility of changes over the years in some
of the characteristics that were compared, e.g., weight,
these comparisons were done both excluding and
including the older awareness case reports, i.e., those
published prior to 1984. The results were not mean-
ingfully affected by including the older awareness
case reports, so only the comparisons excluding them
are reported.
RESULTS
Journals and Time Periods of Publication
The tabulation of percentages of case reports of
awareness during anesthesia that were published in
different journals (Table 1) indicates that four journals
(Anesthesia & Analgesia, Anesthesiology, British Journal of
Anesthesia, and The Lancet) accounted for about two-
thirds of the cases. The percentages of case reports
published in different time periods from 1950 through
2005 are shown in Table 2. There was a marked
increase in case reports since 1990, with more than
75% of case reports published since then. The average
numbers of case reports per year were larger for
1990­99 and 2000­05 than for each of the earlier
decades, with significance ranging from P  0.04 to
P  0.0001.
Exclusions
We excluded the characteristics for which more
than 60% of the data were missing. These were the
ASA classification of patients (identified only in 31%
of the reports) and postoperative management (iden-
tified only in 30% of the reports).
Quantitative Characteristics
Quantitative characteristics of patients who experi-
enced awareness during anesthesia that were exam-
ined were age, weight, and BMI (Table 3). The patients
described in the awareness case reports were younger
than the patients who did not experience awareness in
the study of the incidence of awareness during anes-
thesia by Sebel et al.2 (P  0.001), but did not differ in
age from the patients in the National Survey of
Ambulatory Surgery (P  0.69). The patients de-
scribed in the awareness case reports did not differ in
weight or BMI from subjects in the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (P  0.39 or
larger). Based on categories of BMI,§ the percentages
of patients described in the awareness case reports
who were underweight, normal weight, preobese or
obese were 5%, 41%, 35%, and 19%, respectively.
Qualitative Characteristics
There were also some qualitative characteristics of
patients and procedures described in the awareness
case reports that could be compared to those of
patients who did not experience awareness in the
study by Sebel et al.2 Table 4 provides information
about five such characteristics for which data were
available for almost all patients in Sebel et al.'s study.
For one of these characteristics, gender, the awareness
case reports could also be compared with patients in
the National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery. The

patients described in the awareness case reports in-
cluded a smaller percentage of men than Sebel et al.'s
patients who did not experience awareness (P  0.05),
but did not differ in gender from the patients in the
National Survey of Ambulatory Surgery (P  0.80).
Relative to Sebel et al.'s patients who did not experience
awareness, the case reports of awareness involved a
different frequency distribution of types of surgery
(P  0.0001), particularly an over-representation of car-
diac and obstetric procedures, and exhibited more
episodes of tachycardia (P  0.0001) and hypertension
(P  0.0001).
Anesthetic Regimens, Characteristics of Episodes of
Awareness and its Management
Table 5 provides information about the anesthetic
regimens used. No volatile anesthetic or propofol was
administered during maintenance of anesthesia to
23% of patients. A volatile anesthetic or propofol was
administered along with nitrous oxide during main-
tenance of anesthesia to 43%, and without nitrous
oxide to 34% of patients with awareness. Most catego-
ries of drugs that were used showed less frequent use
in the awareness case reports than in Sebel et al.'s
control patients; this was the case for benzodiazepines
for premedication; thiopental or propofol for induc-
tion; isoflurane, sevoflurane, or desflurane for main-
tenance; propofol for maintenance; and opioids as
co-adjuvants (P  0.0001 by 2 test for each). The only
drugs that did not show such a difference were nitrous
oxide and neuromuscular blockers. Patient movement
was noted in about one in seven awareness case
reports and development of tachycardia and hyper-
tension occurred in about one in five. Episodes of
awareness occurred most frequently during mainte-
nance of anesthesia, less during induction and least
during emergence. The time after surgery when

awareness was first reported varied. A good number
of cases, 37%, were reported after more than a week
postoperatively.
Complaints Caused by Awareness and its Sequelae
Table 6 provides frequencies of complaints and
postoperative sequelae. Sebel et al.'s2 control pa-
tients voiced these complaints infrequently (10%),
while a larger percentage of the awareness case
reports patients did (52%; P  0.0001 by 2 test).
Table 7 shows significant associations of patients'
complaints during episodes of awareness with se-
quelae. Inability to move and feelings of helpless-
ness, anxiety, panic, impending death or catastrophe
were each associated with four of the five sequelae
that were tabulated. Sensation of weakness or pa-
ralysis, noises that were identified, hearing voices
and other complaints were each associated with one
of the five sequelae. Pain was not associated with
any of the sequelae.
Risk Factors and Causes of Awareness
A history of awareness was present in 1.6% of cases
and a difficult and prolonged laryngoscopy and intu-
bation in 4.5%. The most frequent cause of awareness
was overly light anesthesia (Table 8). Increased anes-
thetic requirement was assigned as the cause when the
anesthetic was considered as adequate for the patient
and the surgery and when malfunction or misuse of
the anesthetic machine could be excluded.
DISCUSSION
The adoption of randomized controlled designs to
answer important questions about awareness is pre-
vented by its low incidence, ethical concerns about
exposing patients to potential risk factors, e.g., very
light anesthesia and inability to randomize clinical
situations and practices, e.g., difficult and prolonged
laryngoscopy and intubation (which is often unantici-
pated and has a low rate of occurrence)10 and complete
muscle paralysis during maintenance of anesthesia
(which is undesirable, but may be required by surgical
conditions). Therefore, a major part of the literature
concerning the causative and risk factors, autonomic
and motor changes during the episodes, the nature of
patients' complaints in the postoperative period and
the sequelae, is derived from anecdotal experiences
and personal beliefs. We chose to analyze reported

cases of awareness in the modern era from the first
one in 1950 through August, 2005.
The sources of the awareness reports are of interest.
While the major source came as expected from anesthe-
sia journals, The Lancet, the prestigious British Medical
Journal, published as many reports as Anesthesiology.
Historically, the first report of awareness during an-
esthesia in the modern era came from the United
Kingdom (and was published in a general medical
journal8), and most of the studies of its incidence came
from the United Kingdom and Scandinavia.
The incidence of awareness in general has de-
creased from 1.2% and 0.8% in the 1960s and 1970s to
the current figure of 0.1% to 0.2%11 (with the exception
of the reported incidence of 0.007% by Pollard et al.3).
However, a different trend in the number of reports is
apparent in the present study (Table 2). Winterbot-
tom's report in 19508 was followed by a hiatus of 9 yr,
during which awareness was ignored as far as publi-
cations were concerned. Then, there followed a pro-
gressive increase that reached its peak from the 1990s
onward. This increase may be partly explained by the
trend toward publication of multiple reports in a
single article, but equally important is the increased
prominence of the subject. There is a heightened
interest in the subject by anesthesia providers, as
evidenced by studies of the effect of anesthetics and
sedative-hypnotics on explicit and implicit memories,
introduction of monitors that assess the depth of
anesthesia, studies of the psychological and medico-
legal consequences of awareness, review articles, book
chapters, and a book. The public news media and
entertainment industry also became interested in the
subject and, through them, the patients.
Females were over-represented relative to males in
the reported cases of awareness when compared to the
control sample in Sebel et al.'s study. This is consistent
with the results of other studies.11­14 Women recover
more rapidly from anesthesia than men, which may
suggest that they may be less sensitive to the effects of
anesthetics on the brain.12,15,16 It has been sug-
gested11,17 that there may be a higher incidence of
awareness in obese patients for several reasons, in-
cluding the often prolonged time for endotracheal
intubation, the use of higher concentrations of oxygen
in nitrous oxide-oxygen mixtures and the difficulty of
giving appropriate doses of drugs without causing
postoperative respiratory depression. Our survey
does not corroborate this supposed risk. The prepon-
derance of cardiac and obstetric procedures in the
awareness reports compared to the nonawareness
sample is to be expected, because of the tendency to
use light anesthesia in these cases.11 Our findings
regarding the time of reporting of awareness corrobo-
rate the current practice of interviewing patients more
than once, including the recovery room.11
The anesthetic regimens that were reported in
awareness cases used less premedicants, induction
and maintenance anesthetics and less opioids as com-
pared with the control sample. Patient movement

532 Review of Reported Cases of Awareness ANESTHESIA & ANALGESIA
during the operation was also noted in a relatively
high number of awareness cases as was the develop-
ment of hypertension and tachycardia. These signs, as
well as the use of smaller amounts of anesthetic drugs
and their adjuvants, are correlates of overly light
anesthesia, which was the most common cause of
awareness. An alternative explanation for the higher
incidence of hypertension and tachycardia in the
awareness sample is the attention, over approximately
the last decade, to strict control of arterial blood
pressure and heart rate during anesthesia, which
could be displayed more in the control sample. There
were no differences between the frequency of use of
nitrous oxide and neuromuscular blockers in the
awareness and nonawareness samples. There are no
studies that rigorously assessed the risk of avoidance
of nitrous oxide on the incidence of awareness. In a
meta-analysis of the effect of omitting nitrous oxide in
general anesthesia on postoperative emesis,18 an inci-
dental finding was that omitting nitrous oxide in-
creased the incidence of awareness. However, the
representativeness of this finding is debatable, as only
29% of the trials that were analyzed included aware-
ness as an outcome measure, the search strategy did
not indicate that awareness was intended as an out-
come, and the increased incidence of awareness when
nitrous oxide was omitted was derived in large part
from a single study19 in which the results were not
significant. It was also clear that the total anesthetic
dose, as defined by minimum alveolar anesthetic
concentration multiples, was larger in the group given
nitrous oxide.
Our finding of the absence of differences in the use
of neuromuscular blockers between the experimental
and control samples is not surprising. It does not
contradict the reasoning that awareness is, to a large
degree, an iatrogenic mishap caused by the use of
muscle relaxants. The use of neuromuscular blockers
has been ubiquitous since their introduction in 1942.
Indeed, the first case report of awareness involved the
use of curare.8 As opposed to the paralyzed but
inadequately anesthetized patient who may regain
consciousness while remaining motionless, a nonpara-
lyzed patient will usually (but not invariably) commu-
nicate his or her wakefulness by movement, which
alerts the anesthesia provider to deepen the anesthetic
and thus lessens the incidence of recall. It is sound
preventive advice to avoid muscle paralysis unless it
is needed and even then to avoid total paralysis.
Many patients who become aware during surgery
report a variety of complaints that are associated with
considerable dissatisfaction with their anesthesia
care.20 The most common complaint in this study was
auditory perception (voices in 66% and noises in 17%
of cases), followed by loss of motor function (inability
to move in 34%, and sensation of weakness or paraly-
sis in 17% of cases), pain (38%), and feelings of
helplessness, anxiety, panic, impending death or ca-
tastrophe (34%). In a recent study by Samuelsson et al.,21
auditory and tactile perceptions were the most com-
mon (70% and 72% respectively), followed by feelings
of helplessness, acute fear, and panic (56%, 58%, and
43% respectively). Pain was experienced by 46% of the
patients.
Awareness may lead to postoperative sequelae that
may persist for varying durations. Sleep problems
were common (sleep disturbances in 19% and night-
mares in 21% of patients). Fear of future anesthetics
was reported in 20% of patients and daytime anxiety
in 17%. Late psychological symptoms, which may lead
to a severe and debilitating illness (posttraumatic
stress disorder), were first described by Meyer and
Blacher in 1961.22. We noted these symptoms in 22% of
our patients. In the Samuelsson et al. study,21 there
was a 33% incidence. In our review, inability to move
and feelings such as helplessness, anxiety and panic
were significantly related to the persistence of late
psychological symptoms. Wang,23 based on his stud-
ies of victims of awareness in his practice, has sug-
gested that frequently the inability to move during
surgery raises the patient's misconception that the
state is irreversible, causing acute psychological
trauma that may persist if it is not explained. Some
authors have expressed their belief (without evidence)
that pain would be a precipitating cause of prolonged
psychological effects.1,24 Yet, pain and hearing voices
or noises were not related to the late psychological
symptoms in our review. These results are also corrobo-
rated by those of Samuelsson et al.21 and Guerra.25 It is
interesting that Blacher26 has claimed earlier that
patients who are wide awake, although they may
suffer greatly during the procedure, may have fewer
traumatic symptoms afterward than those who are in
an obtunded state, perhaps because while awake what
happens is not in doubt. Perhaps patients who com-
plain initially of inability to move and experience
feelings of helplessness, anxiety, panic, impending
death or catastrophe should be paid particular atten-
tion and be referred early for psychiatric help.
Guerra25 has suggested that the response to awareness
may also depend on the patient's personality and
psychiatric history. Other factors, e.g., failure of the
surgery to cure the patient, or the emergence of
serious postoperative complications, may also play a
part.27
This review suggested two risk factors for aware-
ness during anesthesia. The first is the use of light
anesthesia. The second is the presence of a history of
awareness. The late Professor Utting28 warned anes-
thesiologists in 1975 that "a history of awareness
should always be treated seriously and the anesthetic
should be given with scrupulous care by a consultant
anesthetist if medico-legal trouble is to be avoided." It
seems that this advice has not always been followed.
Difficult and prolonged laryngoscopy and intuba-
tion were associated with awareness in only 4.5% of
the cases. Considering that the overall incidence of
difficult intubation varies from 4.5% to 7.5%,10 it was

not found to play a major role as a risk factor.
Administration of supplemental doses of induction
hypnotics should prevent the patients from regaining
consciousness when this problem arises.
The major cause of awareness was overly light
anesthesia at the time of the episode. Anesthetic
machine malfunction or misuse and increased anesthetic
requirement were much less frequent. The end-tidal
anesthetic gas concentrations that prevent awareness
are unknown. In a recent study by Avidan et al.,29
there were sustained periods during surgery when
these concentrations were under 0.7 minimum alveo-
lar concentration in 75% of 1937 patients who never-
theless did not experience awareness. In cases where
light anesthesia is deemed necessary, the use of even
small doses of amnesic drugs, e.g., scopolamine, mi-
dazolam, subanesthetic doses of ketamine, or inhaled
anesthetics and/or regional anesthesia, should be con-
sidered.1 The use of a cerebral function monitor may
reduce the incidence of awareness.3
Proper maintenance of anesthesia equipment,
checkout protocols before administration of an anes-
thetic, gas analyzers sampling the inspired and end-
tidal concentrations of the inhaled anesthetics, setting
of alarms when vaporizers become empty and using
total IV anesthesia only when the anesthesia providers
have continuous access to the entire anesthetic delivery
system can reduce the incidence of machine malfunc-
tion or misuse. Variability in response to anesthetics is
common in everyday practice. It is possible that
chronic use of alcohol, opioids and sedative hypnotics
may increase the anesthetic dose needed to produce
and maintain unconsciousness.1 Unfortunately, there
was not enough information in our data about the use
or abuse of these substances. Increased anesthetic
requirement of some patients may be detected by the
use of brain function monitoring.
The main strength of the present study is the large
number of cases that were reviewed, increasing the
confidence in our results and conclusions. However,
issues relating to bias pose several challenges. Publi-
cation of case reports depends on voluntary efforts by
the authors and acceptance by the editors of scientific
journals. Another source of bias is the inability to
precisely match the reported cases of awareness with
control groups coming from the same time period.
Although the majority of the cases were published in
the period from 1990 to 2005, 22% of the cases came
from an earlier period. Therefore, comparisons be-
tween data sets may have been influenced by changes
over the years in certain characteristics, e.g., obesity of
the general population or use of -blockers in the
perioperative period, which could affect the inci-
dences of tachycardia and hypertension. Other differ-
ences in characteristics between the reported cases of
awareness and the patients of Sebel at al.2 may have
influenced the comparisons, and it was not feasible to
control these, e.g., by analysis of covariance. A third
source of bias relates to the lack of data in some
reports concerning factors such as race, use of recre-
ational drugs and others that may be relevant to the
phenomenon of awareness. The high rates of missing
data for some of the characteristics that we examined
also limit confidence in the conclusions that can be
reached concerning these characteristics. We do not
know whether the individuals for whom information
concerning a characteristic was not reported had the
same distribution on that characteristic as the indi-
viduals for whom information was reported. Al-
though we omitted any characteristic with more than
60% missing data from consideration, our conclusions
may be regarded as tentative, pending independent
confirmation.
In conclusion, we reviewed 271 cases of awareness
and compared their data with those for patients who
did not suffer from awareness. Despite the steady
decline in the incidence of awareness since the 1960s
and 1970s, an opposite trend in the number of reports
was found. A preponderance of females was equivo-
cal, and obesity did not seem to increase the incidence.
About one-quarter of the aware patients received no
volatile anesthetic or propofol during maintenance of
anesthesia and there was less frequent use of premedi-
cants and induction and maintenance drugs, except
neuromuscular blockers, in this group. The use of
nitrous oxide did not make a difference in the inci-
dence of awareness. There was an over-representation
of cardiac and obstetric procedures. Patients' move-
ments, tachycardia and hypertension were relatively
common during surgery. Only 35% of patients re-
ported the awareness episode during their stay in the
recovery room. The most common complaints of pa-
tients were auditory perception and loss of motor
power. Awareness may lead to both immediate and
late psychological problems. Inability to move and
feelings such as helplessness, anxiety and panic were
significantly related to the persistence of late psycho-
logical symptoms. We suggest light anesthesia and a
history of awareness, as risk factors; light anesthesia
was the most common cause. We discussed our find-
ings in light of the existing literature and suggest
measures to decrease the incidence.
