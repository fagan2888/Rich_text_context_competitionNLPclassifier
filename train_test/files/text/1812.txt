The relationships between levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in blood and air have not been well characterized in the general population where
exposure concentrations are generally at parts per billion levels. This study investigates relationships between the levels of nine VOCs, namely, benzene,
chloroform, 1,4-dichlorobenzene, ethylbenzene, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), tetrachloroethene, toluene, and m-/p- and o-xylene, in blood and air
from a stratified random sample of the general US population. We used data collected from 354 participants, including 89 smokers and 265 nonsmokers,
aged 20­59 years, who provided samples of blood and air in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2000.
Demographic and physiological characteristics were obtained from self-reported information; smoking status was determined from levels of serum
cotinine. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the relationships between VOC levels in air and blood, while adjusting for effects of
smoking and demographic factors. Although levels of VOCs in blood were positively correlated with the corresponding air levels, the strength of
association (R2) varied from 0.02 (ethylbenzene) to 0.68 (1,4-DCB). Also the blood­air relationships of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes
(BTEX) were influenced by smoking, exposure­smoking interactions, and by gender, age, and BMI, whereas those of the other VOCs were not.
Interestingly, the particular exposure­smoking interaction for benzene was different from those for toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes. Whereas
smokers retained more benzene in their blood at increasing exposure levels, they retained less toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes at increasing exposure
levels. Investigators should consider interaction effects of exposure levels and smoking when exploring the blood­air relationships of the BTEX
compounds in the general population.

Introduction
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are widely used in the
manufacture of building and furnishing materials and in
consumer products, such as paints and cleaning agents, and
are released from gasoline and other fuels (Wallace et al.,
1989). Humans are typically exposed to higher concentra-
tions of VOCs indoors than outdoors (Wallace, 1987a).
Formaldehyde can be emitted from carpet, cushions, and
particleboard, tetrachloroethene from dry cleaned clothing
and fabric protectors, toluene and xylenes from paints,
varnishes, and adhesives, benzene from stored fuels and
cigarette smoke, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1,4-DCB) from
moth repellents and deodorizers (USEPA, 2007). Even tap
water can be a source of VOCs, such as chloroform, a
product of chlorinated water treatment (Stern and Tardiff,
1997; Mehlman, 2002), and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE),
a fuel oxygenate that contaminates water supplies (Prah
et al., 2004). While air concentrations of VOCs are typically
at parts per million (p.p.m.) levels in the workplace, they
rarely exceed parts per billion (p.p.b.) levels in the general
environment (Rappaport and Kupper, 2004). In fact, some
of the highest levels of environmental (nonoccupational)
exposures to VOCs occur during gasoline refueling, where
benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes (BTEX) can
achieve air concentrations in the low p.p.m. range for a few
minutes (Backer et al., 1997; Egeghy et al., 2000). Note that
p.p.m. air concentrations of MTBE have also been reported
during gasoline refueling (Vayghani and Weisel, 1999).
Human studies have consistently demonstrated that a range
of health disorders is associated with VOC exposures,
including asthma and hematopoietic malignancies (IARC,
1985, 1989; Delfino et al., 2003). However, such evidence rests
largely upon results from occupational populations exposed to

very high levels of the contaminants. Indeed, because personal
air concentrations of VOCs are generally very low (p.p.b.) and
poorly characterized in environmental epidemiology studies,
the links between VOC exposures and environmental diseases,
such as childhood asthma or leukemia, have not been well
elucidated in the general population (Pappas et al., 2000;
Duarte-Davidson et al., 2001; Delfino et al., 2003; Rumchev
et al., 2004; Steffen et al., 2004; Knox, 2005; Elliott et al.,
2006). Recent applications of passive monitors for measuring
VOCs in ambient air suggest that it may be feasible to obtain
personal exposure data from large numbers of subjects in
future epidemiology studies of the general public (Adgate
et al., 2004; Sexton et al., 2004).
In the past two decades, biological measurements (bio-
markers) have been considered as alternatives to air sampling
for assessing chemical exposures because they account for all
possible exposure pathways (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, and
dermal uptake) and individual susceptibility (Mutti, 1999;
Sabbioni and Jones, 2002; Lin et al., 2005). In occupational
studies, levels of VOCs and their metabolites in breath, blood
and urine tend to be highly correlated with the corresponding
air levels (Rappaport et al., 2002; Egeghy et al., 2003;
Fustinoni et al., 2005). However, relationships between
concentrations of VOCs in the general environment and the
corresponding biomarker levels have been ambiguous (Lin
et al., 2005). For example, while Egeghy et al. (2000) found
that benzene in personal air and exhaled breath were highly
correlated (r¼ 0.77 for the logged levels) following short
(1­10 min) exposures at levels ranging from approximately
4 p.p.b. to 10 p.p.m., Wallace et al. (1996) would not
recommend exhaled breath as a surrogate for VOC exposure
at levels less than 1p.p.m. (Wallace et al., 1996). Similarly, our
previous study of benzene biomarkers found that albumin
adducts of some reactive benzene metabolites, namely, benzene
oxide and 1,4-benzoquinone, were clearly related to occupa-
tional benzene exposures above 1 p.p.m. but not to exposures
below 1 p.p.m., where background sources came into play
(Lin et al., 2007). Likewise, Kim et al. (2006a,b) reported
trends between levels of five urinary metabolites and benzene
exposures that became increasingly obscured as air levels
decreased from p.p.m. to p.p.b. levels. The objective of the
current study was to investigate the relationships between levels
of nine common VOCs in blood and personal air samples from
the general (US) population, using data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­
2000 (CDCa). The effects of several factors, namely, smoking,
age, gender, alcohol consumption, and race/ethnicity, on the
blood­air relationships were also examined.
Materials and Methods
Data source
Data were obtained from the NHANES 1999­2000, a cross-
sectional household survey of the noninstitutionalized US
civilian population. (These data were made publicly available
by the Centers for Disease Control in 2006­2007 (CDCa).)
Participant enrollment used a stratified, multistage, prob-
ability-based sampling design. Demographic data were
obtained using questionnaires, interviews, and health exam-
inations, and biological samples were collected in partici-
pants' homes and in a mobile examination center. Detailed
information on the design and operation of NHANES has
been reported previously (CDCb). Levels of VOCs in air and
blood were measured for only a subsample of participants in
the 1999­2000 survey.
Study population
We restricted our analysis to participants aged 20­59 years
with valid measurement of VOCs (no missing data), stratified
by smoking status. Of 662 participants with measurements of
at least one VOC of interest, 287 participants were excluded
from the final analysis due to missing blood measurements,
12 due to missing or inadequate airborne measurements, and
9 due to missing information about smoking status. This left
a total of 354 subjects with complete data. Note that
although questionnaire information on smoking status (``do
you currently smoke?'') was available, serum cotinine was
used as the primary surrogate of smoking status (Wei et al.,
2001). Subjects with levels of serum cotinine greater than
14 ng/ml were classified as smokers, the others as non-
smokers. In the absence of a valid serum cotinine measure-
ment (0.8% of 354 eligible participants), smoking status was
determined from questionnaire responses.
Measurement of airborne and blood VOCs
The NHANES 1999­2000 survey provided measurements of
numerous VOCs, including the BTEX compounds, several
halogenated compounds, and some oxygen-containing com-
pounds. We restricted our analyses to nine VOCs that were
measured in both blood and air samples, namely, benzene,
chloroform, 1,4-DCB, ethylbenzene, MTBE, tetrachloro-
ethene, toluene, and m-/p-, and o-xylenes. (Note that
m- and p-xylenes were measured as one analyte in the gas
chromatography­mass spectrometry (GC­MS) analysis.)
The numbers of available measurements of these VOCs in
air and blood and the corresponding limits of detection
(LODs) are summarized in Table 1. The LODs were typically
at concentrations of a few mg/m3 in air and o1 ng/ml in
blood. Trichloroethene was excluded from analysis because
only 25% of the air measurements and 11% of the blood
measurements were above the respective LOD (data not
shown). Details of the exposure assessment have been
reported elsewhere (CDCb). In brief, air exposures were
measured for a period of 48­72 h with passive personal
monitors (Model 3520 Organic Vapor Monitors, 3 M, St.
Paul, Minnesota, USA). All air samples were refrigerated at
41C prior to solvent extraction and analysis via GC­MS. The
VOC levels in whole blood were determined via GC­MS of
VOCs in air and blood from the general population

Statistical analyses
NHANES used a complex sampling design, including
over-sampling of minorities and young children, and
provided sampling weights for constructing national estimates.
Unweighted statistical analyses were performed with SAS
9.12 (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina, USA), and
weighted analyses were performed using SUDAAN 9.01
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina, USA) to produce unbiased variance estimates
using the Taylor-series linearization method (Wolter, 1985).
Since air and blood VOC data were right skewed, geometric
mean (GM) and interquartile ranges were used to characterize
data distributions in the weighted analyses, as suggested by
NHANES guidelines (CDCd). Also, we applied natural
logarithmic transformations to satisfy normality assumptions
for all air and blood concentrations. We assessed group
differences with the Student's t-test for continuous variables
and the Cochran­Mantel­Haenszel w2-test for categorical
variables. We used simple and multiple linear regression
models to investigate crude and adjusted relationships
between air and blood VOCs. The derived R2 value was
used to evaluate the strengths of associations in regression
models. Covariates included in the multiple regression models
were selected based upon preliminary univariate analyses and
findings from previous studies. All percentages and results
from regression models represent population-weighted
values.
Results
The demographic characteristics of the subjects are summa-
rized in Table 2. There were 354 subjects, including 89
smokers and 265 nonsmokers, equivalent to an estimated US
population of 80,127,494 persons aged 20­59 years, after
adjusting for sample weights. Ages differed significantly
between smokers and nonsmokers (P ¼ 0.03) but showed no
trend across age categories. Also, current alcohol users (Z1
drink per day), males, and Mexican Americans were more
likely to smoke, but the differences were not significant
(0.15ZP40.05). Other variables did not differ significantly
between smokers and nonsmokers.
The distributions of VOC concentrations (GMs and
interquartile ranges) in both air and blood are shown in
Table 3, stratified by smoking status. (Note that Table 3

includes only subjects with both air and blood measure-
ments.) Significantly higher levels of airborne tetrachloro-
ethene were found in nonsmokers (Po0.05). When all
subjects with and without blood measurements of benzene
were included (n ¼ 619), the GM level of benzene in air was
significantly higher in smokers (P ¼ 0.04) (GM ¼ 3.81 mg/m3)
than nonsmokers (GM ¼ 2.81 mg/m3) (data not shown). In
contrast to the air measurements, blood levels of all BTEX
compounds were significantly elevated in smokers compared
to nonsmokers (Po0.05).
Both simple and covariate-adjusted relationships between
air levels and blood levels of VOCs (in log scale) are shown in
Table 4. Referring first to the simple regression models
(unadjusted), levels of all VOCs in blood were positively
associated with the corresponding air concentrations, and
these associations were significant except for ethylbenzene
(P ¼ 0.24) and toluene (P ¼ 0.19) in smoking subjects.
However, the corresponding R2 values varied widely, from
0.02 (ethylbenzene) to 0.68 (1,4-DCB), across VOCs and
smoking status. This indicates that large proportions of the
variation in the levels of blood VOCs were related to factors
other than the corresponding air concentrations. The
amounts of explained variability of unadjusted relationships
between blood and airborne VOC levels tended to be higher
among nonsmokers (median R2 ¼ 0.24) than among smokers
(median R2 ¼ 0.14), but this difference was not statistically
significant (P ¼ 0.12, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Following
adjustment for age, gender, BMI, race/ethnicity, and alcohol
consumption, the estimated regression coefficients (bs) did
not change appreciably (o15%) (Table 4). On the other
hand, the values of R2 increased considerably in both
smokers (B160%) and nonsmokers (B40%) after adjust-
ment for these covariates, although this difference in R2
between smokers and nonsmokers was still not significant
(P ¼ 0.66, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). Using models either
with or without adjustment for covariates, values of R2 were
greater among nonsmokers than among smokers for all
VOCs except benzene, chloroform, and MTBE. This points
to the potential for smoking to confound or modify
relationships between exposures to VOCs and the corre-
sponding internal doses if smoking status is not included in
regression models.
Given significant differences between smokers and non-
smokers in certain demographic characteristics such as BMI,
we also investigated the possible combined effect of smoking
and the other covariates on relationships between VOC levels
in blood and air. As shown in Table 5, the values of

smokers for BTEX. On the other hand, values of R2
increased only marginally for chloroform, 1,4-DCB, MTBE,
and tetrachloroethene, following adjustment for smoking
and other covariates. Table 5 also includes results from a
study of VOC levels in blood and air among Minnesota
children by Sexton et al. (2005), who reported unadjusted
values of R2. Note that, aside from toluene, our findings
from unadjusted analyses (adults aged 20­65 years) are
comparable to the results from that earlier study in children.
Given the combined effects of smoking and other
covariates on the relationships between BTEX levels in
blood and air, more detailed multivariable analyses were
conducted for these compounds. As summarized in Table 6,
significant or marginally significant interaction effects be-
tween smoking and air levels were observed for all BTEX
compounds (0.005rPr0.09). Because the regressions were
performed in log scale, the estimated regression coefficients,
shown in Table 6, are multipliers which express fold increases
(or decreases) in blood levels of a particular BTEX
compound at a given air concentration relative to a reference
group. For instance, at a benzene concentration of 1 mg/m3
the predicted level of benzene in blood would be 2.48 (i.e.,
e0.908) times greater in smokers than in nonsmokers

(reference group); but at a benzene concentration of 10 mg/m3
the level of benzene in blood would be 6.35 (i.e., e1.85) times
greater in smokers. This suggests that smokers not only were
exposed to benzene in cigarette smoke, but also retained
increasingly more benzene from the environment than
nonsmokers as exposure levels increased. This is in contrast
to results from the other BTEX compounds, where all the
interaction effects between smoking and exposure were
negative, indicating that smokers retained decreasing
amounts of toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes at
increasing exposure levels. Although none of the other
covariates (gender, BMI, age, alcohol consumption, and
race/ethnicity) reached significance in the full regression
models, we observed that blood VOC levels increased with
BMI and were higher in females and in younger subjects
(aged 20­29 years) after controlling for exposure and other
explanatory variables.
Discussion
In this study of environmental exposures to nine VOCs, we
found significant associations between the levels of all
compounds in blood and air, except for ethylbenzene and
toluene in smoking subjects. The strengths of associations
between the logged levels of individual VOCs in blood and
air varied greatly, with unadjusted values of R2 ranging
between 0.02 (ethylbenzene) and 0.68 (1,4-DCB). This
finding is generally consistent with results from a recent
study of children in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA (Sexton
et al., 2005).
We observed that the relationships between levels of
individual VOCs in air and blood were modified by smoking
for the BTEX compounds but not for chloroform, 1,4-DCB,
MTBE, and tetrachloroethene. Although smoking has long
been recognized as an important source of exposure to
benzene and other VOCs in the general population (Wallace
et al., 1987b; Rappaport and Kupper, 2004), our results
suggest that smoking also modified the amounts of the BTEX
compounds that were retained in the body at a given
exposure concentration. Interestingly, the retention of
benzene increased with increasing exposure among smokers,
while retention of toluene, ethylbenzene, and the xylenes
decreased with increasing exposure among smokers. To our
knowledge, this behavior of BTEX compounds has not been
reported heretofore and should be further investigated.
Compared to smoking, the other explanatory variables in
the database had only weak effects (Table 6) for the BTEX
compounds. The observation that females had higher levels
of BTEX in their blood at a given exposure is consistent with
findings from toxicokinetic models and a controlled human
inhalation study of 1,3-butadiene, where females retained

more 1,3-butadiene than males (Kohn and Melnick, 1993;
Lin et al., 2001). Since the BTEX compounds, as well as
1,3-butadiene, are lipophilic substances, this finding probably
relates to the increased proportion of body fat in females
compared to males. Increased body fat may also explain the
trends toward increasing levels of BTEX compounds in
blood with increasing BMI, after adjusting for exposure,
especially for obese subjects (BMI 430) (Table 6). The
marginal effect of decreasing blood BTEX levels with age is
also comparable to results from controlled 1,3-butadiene
exposures (Lin et al., 2001), and may reflect a decrease in the
efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange with increasing age,
especially after age 30 (Crapo and Morris, 1981; Sprung
et al., 2006; American Society of Anesthesiologists).
Neither smoking nor the other covariates significantly
altered the relationships between levels in air and blood for
chloroform, 1,4-DCB, MTBE, and tetrachloroethene. This
may point to the contribution of sources and/or exposure
pathways other than inhaled air and cigarette smoke to these
compounds. For instance, in addition to inhalation of
chloroform emitted from heated water (Giardino and
Andelman, 1996), exposure to chloroform can also occur
although ingestion and dermal absorption (Lindstrom et al.,
1997; Kuo et al., 1998; Meek et al., 2002; Egorov et al.,
2003; Lee et al., 2004). Exposure pathways other than
inhalation can become disproportionately important at low
levels of environmental exposure (Johnson et al., 2007).
Particular exposure profiles can also affect relationships
between VOC levels in blood and air as governed by the
operative toxicokinetic processes. Since VOCs have short
biological half-lives, levels in blood tend to reflect exposures
which occurred in the few hours immediately preceding blood
collection. Yet, the air levels in the NHANES study were
measured with passive personal monitors over periods of 2 or
3 days. Thus, if exposures changed greatly over time scales of
hours, air and blood levels in the cross-sectional NHANES
database would become increasingly discordant. In a long-
itudinal study of VOC exposures, Sexton et al. (2005) noted
that air levels of 1,4-DCB were very consistent in their
subjects from day to day; this could explain the particularly
strong relationship between blood and air levels of 1,4-DCB
in both Sexton's study and our results from the NHANES
data (Table 5).
