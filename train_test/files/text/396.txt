Barriers to the use of genetic testing: A study of racial
and ethnic disparities
Sandra Suther, PhD, and Gebre-Egziabher Kiros, PhD
Purpose: Racial and ethnic disparities in health are evident among a
range of diseases and health care services. New genetic technologies are
likely to increase these disparities as access to expensive genetic tests
further widens the gap. Methods: Our analysis used data from a
national representative sample collected in 2000. The total sample size
for our analysis was 1724 men and women (consisting of 946 non-
Hispanic whites, 392 Latinos, and 386 blacks) aged 18 to 91 years.
Ordered logistic regression and binary logistic regression analysis were
applied to investigate differences by race/ethnicity. Results: Results
showed significant differences by racial/ethnic groups in knowledge and
concerns about the potential misuse of genetic testing. A significant
difference was also found between the types of health insurance cov-
erage by race/ethnicity as well as significantly higher levels of mistrust
in a physician and the medical system. Conclusion: Our findings raise
concern about several barriers among minorities and calls for a devel-
opment of educational and communication strategies that facilitate in
narrowing the gap between racial and ethnic groups. Genet Med 2009:

Key Words: genetic testing, barriers, health disparity, race, ethnicity
Using national representative sample data, this article exam-
ines racial and ethnic differences in the following barriers
to genetic testing: (a) knowledge about genetic testing; (b) type
of health insurance coverage; (c) concerns about the potential
misuse of genetic testing; and (d) lack of trust in a medical
doctor to keep their medical information private. It uses a
national representative sample and ordered and binary logistic
regression analyses building on previous works by Singer et al.1,2
Genetic testing for predisposition of certain diseases is be-
coming common because scientific discoveries in the field of
genetics and their implementation are enabling people to get
speedy diagnosis of disease and treatments that are individually
tailored with minimum side effects. These predictive genetic
tests will allow individuals who wish to know information about
their individual disease susceptibilities to take steps to reduce
those risks.3
Access to expensive genetic tests is likely to further widen
the gap between those who already receive the best care and
those who do not.4 Racial and ethnic disparities in health
continue to be evident among a range of diseases and health
care services. Hence, genetic testing raises a number of issues
pertinent to the provision of health care and the formulation of
public policy.5 Genomic revelations propose to define human
nature and alter the natural history of disease.6 However, cau-
tion must be taken about these expectations when social deter-
minants of health are still significant factors globally affecting
medicine in the 21st century.
Persistent inequities in access to health care could be inten-
sified by advances in genetic knowledge.1,7 From past experi-
ence, those who will benefit most from these advances will
probably be those who can afford to do so. Even the Healthy
People 2010 revolves around low-cost solutions to public health
issues such as increasing women's folic acid intake to prevent
neural tube defects. But nowhere in this lengthy document does
it push for access by the general population of women to costly
genetic innovations such as genetic screening for breast or
ovarian cancer.8 Genetics plays a role in approximately half of
the 10 leading health indicators selected as public health issues
in the Healthy People 2010 document.9 But of the total 467
objectives, only one deals specifically with genetics (newborn
screening).
Genetic research has given us a greater understanding of the
contribution of genes to health disparities.10 However, discus-
sions regarding the implications or applications of genomic
medicine have not included the perspectives of racial or ethnic
groups.11 The socioecological model provides a useful frame-
work for understanding the factors and barriers that influence
racial and ethnic disparities in the use of genetic testing. An
ecological model examines factors and behaviors from a mul-
tilevel perspective such as intrapersonal (knowledge, attitudes,
beliefs), interpersonal (social norms and cultural acceptance),
institutional and community (identification of resources and
equal access to services), and policy (laws regarding confiden-
tiality and discrimination).12,13 Each level is manipulated and
reinforced by factors and behaviors from the other levels of
influence.14
From an ecological perspective, interactions at all levels can
provide opportunities or constraints15 in the utilization of ge-
netic testing. For example, previous studies have found that
African Americans and Hispanics are less likely to know about
the availability of genetic testing for disease risk1,16­18 and
African Americans are less likely to have confidence in the
potential benefits of genetic testing than whites.16­18 Others
found African American and Latino populations to be more
likely to view genetic testing as interfering with "God's
Will."19,20 Other cultural issues such as discussing cancer risks
with family members may also arise during genetic counseling
and testing among minority populations.21 Thompson et al.19
showed evidence that African American women who declined
BRCA1/2 counseling believed genetic testing to be just another
attempt to stigmatize African Americans.
Apprehension about possible privacy breaches, stigmatiza-
tion, and discrimination may cause physicians and consumers
alike to avoid genetic-related services and participation in re-
search.4 Historically, in the United States and in Europe, ex-
planatory causes of particular diseases or social problems have

been viewed as arising out of genetic material. For example, the
eugenics movement in the United States in the early 1900
proposed solutions to social problems such as poverty by en-
couraging fertility among the upper and middle classes and
discouraging childbearing among the lower socioeconomic
groups. Another example is the period during which Nazi war
criminals of the 1930 and 1940 singled out Jewish, gypsies, and
homosexuals on the grounds that they were genetically inferi-
or.11 More recently, the National Sickle Cell Anemia Control
Act of 1972, which was intended to increase the availability of
services for this trait, resulted in insurance and job discrimina-
tion against individuals carrying this trait.19
Although physicians are deluged with new genetic discover-
ies and ethical dilemmas, many lack the basic knowledge and
skills necessary to incorporate genetic testing and genetic coun-
seling into their practice.22,23 Many primary care practitioners
lack information about genetic services and options available to
patients.24 Not knowing which choices are available decreases
their confidence to assess, counsel, and refer patients to services
offered by genetic clinics. Lack of or poor knowledge of clinical
cancer genetics lessens the chance that a high-risk patient will
be referred to a genetic counselor for potential familial cancer
inheritance.4
The characteristics of the primary care physicians of African
American and non-Hispanic white women may reflect the dif-
ferences in the use of primary prevention genetics such as
BRCA1/2 counseling.17 Primary care physicians seen by African
Americans experience more difficulty delivering specialized
care than primary care physicians visited by non-Hispanic
whites.25 Additionally, physicians treating black patients are
less likely to be board certified. Shields et al.26 found that
minority-serving physicians were less likely to order genetic
testing and less likely to refer a patient to a genetic specialist or
genetic counselor.
The discovery of genetic predisposition to chronic and in-
herited disease has set up the potential for discrimination in
everything from who is marriageable to who is insurable. And
if insurers are allowed to use genetic information in adjusting
premiums, the burden of paying large if not impossible sums to
obtain health care coverage will afflict numerous Americans
who never thought of this as their problem.27 Patients who are
employed in low-paying jobs with little or no health care
benefits are more likely to experience barriers to genetic ser-
vices for financial reasons. African Americans are less likely
than non-Hispanic white Americans to have private or employ-
ment-based health insurance and more likely to be covered by
Medicaid or other publicly funded insurance.5
Hypotheses
The purpose of this article is to examine racial and ethnic
differences in barriers to genetic testing: (a) knowledge about
genetic testing; (b) type of health insurance coverage; (c) con-
cerns about the potential misuse of genetic testing; and (d) lack
of trust in a medical doctor to keep their medical information
private. The study posits the four null hypotheses stated below.
Hypothesis 1: There is no difference in knowledge about
genetic testing by race/ethnicity.
Hypothesis 2: There is no variation in concerns about the
misuse of genetic testing by race/ethnicity.
Hypothesis 3: There is no difference in the type of health
insurance coverage among respondents by race/ethnicity.
Hypothesis 4: There is no difference in lack of trust in
one's physician to keep medical information private by
race/ethnicity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
To achieve our aims and test the above hypotheses, a national
representative sample of data collected in the year 2000 by the
University of Maryland College Park Survey Research Center
was used to investigate racial and ethnic disparities in knowl-
edge and concerns about genetic testing. The specific barriers to
genetic testing that are examined include knowledge, health
insurance, concerns about misuse of testing, privacy and con-
fidentiality concerns, and distrust in their medical doctor.
We conducted a power analysis for logistic regression with
several predictor variables using the software PASS (Power
Analysis and Sample Size) to determine the adequate sample
size needed for our study. To achieve a power of 0.90 and
medium effect size of 0.5 at a 0.05 significance level corre-
sponding to an odds ratio (OR) of 1.50, a sample size between
1345 and 1794 was required depending on the value of R2
assumed. The total sample size for our analysis was 1724 men
and women aged between 18 and 91 years. There were 946
non-Hispanic whites, 386 Latinos, and 351 blacks. For detailed
information about study design, sample size, and other infor-
mation see Ref. 1.
Four dependent variables were analyzed in detail: knowledge
index about genetic testing, types of health insurance coverage,
index regarding concerns about misuse of genetic testing, and
mistrust in physicians. Following Singer et al.1 the knowledge
index about genetic testing was constructed from seven ques-
tions (Cronbach's alpha  0.65) by adding the number of
correct answers given by each participant. Respondents who
answered six or seven questions right were combined together.
The constructed knowledge index variable is an ordinal variable
and has six categories with a range of one to six. An index about
respondent's concerns about misuse of genetic testing was
created from eight questions (Cronbach's alpha  0.71). This
index is also an ordinal variable having three categories: 1, 2,
and 3 where 1 shows the lowest concern and 3 shows the
highest concern about the potential misuse of genetic testing.
The questions used to create both indices are listed in the Appen-
dix, Supplemental Digital Content, http://links.lww.com/A1431.
The third dependent variable investigated in this study is the
respondents' type of health insurance: Medicare, Medicaid,
private insurance, or any insurance (all analyzed separately).
The type of health insurance variable had only two categories
(yes or no). The last dependent variable examined is whether or
not the respondent trusts his/her physician to keep medical
information private. The question asks "How much do you trust
your doctor to keep medical information about you private? (1)
a great deal, (2) somewhat, (3) only a little, (4) hardly at all, (8)
Don't know, (9) Refusal." Those who answered (8) and (9)
were small and were excluded from the final analysis. This
variable is also an ordinal variable. In addition to race/ethnicity,
the list of covariates used to predict each dependent variable
outlined above include age, gender, marital status, education,
employment, number of adults in the household, religiosity,
whether the respondent knows anyone having a child born with
a genetic defect, and region of residence.
Descriptive statistics were used to examine distribution of
responses; 2 tests were used to assess associations between
race/ethnicity and all other predictor variables used in this
study. Ordered logistic regression was applied for the ordinal
dependent variables: knowledge index, concerns about potential
misuse of genetic testing, and lack of trust in a medical doctor.
Binary logistic regression was used for type of health insurance.
All analyses used Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Version
9.1.3, Cary, NC). We presented the likelihood ratio 2 test to

assess our models goodness of fit. Additionally, McFadden's
pseudo-R2 was used to indicate how useful the predictor vari-
ables were in predicting the dependent variable. Pseudo-R2 in
logistic regression is analogous to the coefficient of determina-
tion (R2) used in linear regression.28,29 However, it does not
have the same variance interpretation. Therefore, pseudo-R2
values should not be compared across datasets. Pseudo-R2 val-
ues between 0.2 and 0.4 are considered very satisfactory.29 The
OR, also a measure of effect size in logistic regression,28 and its
corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), which measures
the precision of the OR are also reported.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the percentage distribution of respondents by
race/ethnicity and all the predictor variables used in this study.
It also presents a 2 statistic together with its corresponding P
value as a measure of association between each predictor vari-
able and race/ethnicity. More than 70% of the respondents were
35 years or older. Fifty-nine percent of the respondents were
females and 41% were males. More than half of the respondents
were currently married or living with a partner, more than 85%
have high school education or more, and about 70% were
working either full time or part time. About 64% of respondents
live in households where there are at least two adults and 39%
of respondents attend religious services at least once a week.
Overall, about 56% of respondents know someone having a
child born with a genetic defect (63.5% for non-Hispanic
whites, 43.8% for blacks, and 48.7% for Latinos). A test of
association between the predictor variables considered in this
analysis and race/ethnicity using a 2 analysis show there is a
significant difference at   0.05 level of significance except
for employment status (  0.075).
Non-Hispanic white respondents tended to be older than both
blacks and Latinos and blacks were less likely to be currently
married (30.4%) than non-Hispanic whites (58.7%) and Latinos
(53.8%). There was also a significant difference in the educa-
tional level of respondents by race. Latinos (31.3%) had the
highest percentage of respondents with less than high school
education and non-Hispanic whites (30.9%) had the highest
percentage of respondents with college degree or higher educa-
tion. Living arrangement measured by the number of adults in
the household also varied considerably by race. Although about
52% of black respondents live in a household where there are
two or more adults, about 68% of both non-Hispanic whites and
Latinos live in a household where there are two or more adults.
There was a significant variation in respondents' "attendance of
religious services at least once a week" among non-Hispanic
whites (35.9%), blacks (46.5%), and Latinos (37.1%). There
was also substantial variation in knowing someone having a
child born with a genetic defect by race/ethnicity. Although 63.5%
of non-Hispanic whites reported that they know someone having a
child born with a genetic defect, only 43.8% of blacks and 48.7%
of Latinos answered affirmatively for the same question.
Table 2 presents OR from an ordered logistic regression
model predicting knowledge about genetic testing. The likeli-
hood ratio 2 value (197.6, df 23, P  0.001) shows the
presented model fits the data well. The pseudo-R2 value (0.37)
indicates that the model is highly satisfactory in predicting
knowledge about genetic testing. After adjusting for all the
variables included in the regression model, there was a strong
association between race/ethnicity and knowledge about genetic
testing. Both blacks and Latinos had significantly lower knowl-
edge compared with non-Hispanic whites. Given that all other
variables in the model are held constant, the odds of having
adequate knowledge among blacks and Latinos compared with
non-Hispanic whites was lower by 28% and 52%, respectively.
Marital status was also significantly associated with respon-
dent's knowledge about genetic testing. Comparing single ver-
sus currently married or living with a partner, the odds of higher

knowledge about genetic testing was 1.63 times greater among
singles than among currently married, given that all other vari-
ables in the model remain constant. As one would expect,
education also played an important role in knowledge about
genetic testing. Although having a less than high school edu-
cation was negatively associated with knowledge (OR  0.70,
95% CI 0.52­0.94) compared with high school education, hav-
ing some college education (OR  1.39, 95% CI 1.10­1.75)
and college or more than college education (OR  2.13, 95% CI
1.66­2.73) was positively associated. Being the only adult in a
household was negatively associated with high knowledge
score. Furthermore, knowing anyone having a child born with a
genetic defect significantly increased knowledge score by 29%
(OR  1.29, 95% CI 1.07­1.57). The variables religiosity
(measured by the frequency of religious services attendance),
employment, and region of residence had no significant effect
on knowledge about genetic testing.
Results of OR obtained from a logistic regression model by
types of health insurance coverage found significant differences
in the type of health insurance coverage by race/ethnicity.
Compared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks were more likely to
have Medicare (OR  1.68) and/or Medicaid (OR  2.51) and
less likely to have private insurance (OR  0.55). Latinos were
less likely to have private insurance (OR  0.49) or no insur-
ance at all (OR  0.60) compared with non-Hispanic whites. As
expected (results are not shown), older respondents (aged 65
and older) were more likely to have Medicare and those 45
years old above had higher odds of having a private insurance
compared with the 35 to 44 age group. Compared with women,
men were more likely to have Medicare and Medicaid. Al-
though single and previously married had higher odds of having
Medicare and Medicaid, they were less likely to have private
insurance. Education had also a significant effect on type of
health insurance. On one hand, less than high school education
was positively associated with Medicaid, but negatively asso-
ciated with having private health insurance or having any other
insurance at all. On the other hand, college education was
negatively related with Medicare and Medicaid and positively
related with having a private insurance or any insurance. In
addition, being unemployed or working part time was positively
associated with Medicare and Medicaid, but negatively associ-
ated with having a private insurance or any insurance.
Respondents were asked the extent they agree or disagree
with the single statement "Information from genetic tests is
likely to be misused." Although 20% of non-Hispanic whites

agree or strongly agree with the statement, more than one third
of blacks (34%) and 28% of Latinos agree or strongly agree
with the statement. This indicates there is substantial variability
in concerns about the misuse of results from genetic testing by
race/ethnicity with minorities expressing more concern than
non-Hispanic whites.
Results from an ordered logistic regression model predicting
more concerns about misuse of genetic testing are presented in
Table 3. The overall model fit was good (2  76.2, df 23, P 
0.001) and the pseudo-R2 value (0.393) shows the usefulness of
the model in predicting respondent's concerns about the misuse
of genetic testing. The odds of blacks (OR  1.66, 95% CI
1.28­2.15) and Latinos (OR  1.58, 95% CI 1.21­2.07) being
more concerned about the potential misuse of genetic testing
versus non-Hispanic whites was higher by 66% and 58%, re-
spectively. Gender was associated with concerns about the
potential use of genetic testing. Men were 21% less likely to be
concerned about the misuse of genetic testing than women.
College-educated respondents were 37% less likely to be more
concerned about the misuse of genetic testing compared with
those with a high school degree. Religiosity was also signifi-
cantly and positively associated with more concerns about the
misuse of genetic testing. Age, marital status, employment,
number of adults in the household, knowledge of someone
having a child born with a genetic defect, and region were not
associated with concerns about misuse of genetic testing.
Finally, Table 4 presents results from an ordered logistic
regression model predicting respondent's lack of trust in their
medical doctor in keeping information about them private. The
overall model fit was good (2  58.7, df 23, P  0.001) and
the pseudo-R2 value (0.19) confirmed that the model was sat-
isfactory in predicting lack of trust in a physician. Again,
controlling for the effects of all the variables in the model, there
was a significant difference in lack of trust in a physician by
race/ethnicity. Compared with non-Hispanic whites, blacks and
Latinos were more likely to distrust their medical doctor in
keeping their medical information private by 48% and 64%,
respectively. In addition, after taking into account the effects of all
other covariates in the model, the odds of having a higher level of
distrust were 1.39 times higher for men than for women. Except for
race/ethnicity and gender, all other variables included in the model
were not significant in predicting distrust in a medical doctor.
In summary, we posited four null hypotheses that stated there
is no racial/ethnic difference in knowledge about genetic test-
ing, concerns about the potential misuse of genetic testing, type

of health insurance, and mistrust in a medical doctor. The
results presented in this study strongly rejected these null hy-
potheses and provide strong evidence that there are significant
differences in these barriers to genetic testing.
Limitations
The data used in the analyses were based on self-reports and
social desirability response bias could be a potential problem.
Additionally, although our findings may reflect true differences
by race and ethnicity in genetic testing, the significant associ-
ations between race/ethnicity and the predictor variables used in
this analysis may create a potential for confounding effects.
DISCUSSION
Ecological analyses suggest that individuals are influenced
by circumstances in their day-to-day sociocultural and physical
environments. Racial and ethnic disparities in genetic testing are
reinforced by factors and behaviors on multiple levels: intrap-
ersonal (knowledge and beliefs), interpersonal (social norms
and cultural acceptance), institutional (identification of re-
sources and equal access to services), and policy (laws regard-
ing confidentiality and discrimination).
Blacks and Latinos are less likely to use genetic testing than
non-Hispanic whites because of challenges and barriers they
face including lack of knowledge or lack of adequate informa-
tion provided by their physicians about genetic testing. Our
analysis points to the need of educating minority populations
about genetic testing so they will be able to make informed
decisions about their own health and the health of their family
members. Furthermore, education and counseling should be
tailored to the educational level and socioeconomic status of the
individual.30,31 As Hall and Olopade4 so aptly pointed out, the
true power of knowledge is to be familiar with your own genetic
risk or family history, which will enable you to ask your
physician whether or not you should be tested.
There is a significant difference in health insurance coverage
by race and ethnicity, which in turn may reflect the disparities
in access to genetic testing. Although blacks are significantly more
likely to be covered by Medicaid or Medicare than non-Hispanic
whites, they have less private insurance coverage. For Latinos, they
are less likely to be covered via a private health insurance. For both
blacks and Latinos, the disparity in private health insurance cov-
erage means less access to expensive genetic testing.

Distrust in the medical system has been determined to be
higher among African Americans than non-Hispanic whites and
may serve as a barrier to health care.19,32,33 Given the racial
focus of the eugenics movement in the past, and historical
experiences like the Tuskegee experiment, racial differences in
attitudes about genetic testing in the general population are
particularly important.16 Health care professionals who identify
and address these cultural issues may increase the number of
high-risk minorities who inquire about genetic counseling and
are referred for risk-appropriate genetic services.34,35 In addi-
tion, information campaigns about the benefits of genetic testing
that focus on minorities and promoting minority participation in
genetic research are of paramount importance. Advancing the
role that racial and ethnic minorities play in shaping and en-
hancing genetic research will further encourage the develop-
ment of critical policies that address the ethical, social, and legal
aspects of genomic medicine.
