Introduction
Clinical interest in the utility of non-invasive measurement
of central aortic pressure (CAP) has heightened in recent
years.1 This is due, in part, to the development of simple,
robust methods for evaluating this clinical parameter,2,3 and
also to the emergence of data demonstrating that central
pressure may be a better marker of risk for developing car-
diovascular pathologies and clinical outcomes than con-
ventional assessment of brachial pressure.4,5 Other key
studies have also established the concept of differential
effects of blood pressure (BP) lowering treatments on bra-
chial and central pressure, promoting calls for the routine
incorporation of central BP measurement in clinical trials.6
More recently, the feasibility of monitoring 24-hour ambu-
latory central aortic pressure was reported.7 This has further

Abstract
Introduction: Whilst sustained lowering of brachial systolic blood pressure (Br-SBP) and central aortic systolic pressure
(CASP) have been demonstrated in patients with hypertension, effects of treatment withdrawal on these parameters
have not been investigated. The ASSERTIVE study previously reported more sustained control of Br-SBP with aliskiren
versus telmisartan in patients with hypertension, following 7-days treatment withdrawal. In this ASSERTIVE sub-study,
we hypothesised that aliskiren would similarly exert more sustained control of CASP than telmisartan during treatment
withdrawal.
Methods: We investigated the effects of treatment withdrawal on both Br-SBP and CASP following 12-weeks treatment
with either aliskiren (300 mg) or telmisartan (80 mg). Br-SBP and CASP were measured at the end of treatment, and at
days 2 and 7 following treatment withdrawal in 303 patients (CASP randomised set).
Results: Of the CASP randomised set, 94 patients completed CASP measurements at all time points (CASP completer
set). After 7 days of treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated lesser increases in both Br-SBP and CASP than
telmisartan; Br-SBP change: -2.0±1.6 vs. +5.6±1.7 mmHg, p = 0.001; CASP change: -0.4±1.6 vs. +4.6±1.7 mmHg,
p = 0.041, n = 94. Similar findings were obtained for the CASP randomised set.
Conclusions: Following treatment withdrawal, aliskiren demonstrated more sustained control of both brachial and
central SBP than telmisartan.

extended the potential clinical utility of central pressure
monitoring.
Whilst the influence of drug treatment on both brachial
and central pressure has been extensively discussed,8 the
influence of drug treatment withdrawal on seated central
pressure is not yet reported. Since missed medication
doses are a frequent occurrence during the treatment of
elevated BP, it is important to verify the consequences on
central aortic pressure in comparison to what has been
described for peripheral blood pressure.9,10 It is possible
that treatment withdrawal could change the relationship
between brachial and central pressure, effects which might
not be apparent from monitoring brachial pressure alone.
Two different strategies for lowering BP via inhibition
of the renin­angiotensin­aldosterone system (RAAS) were
studied. We compared the effects of withdrawal following
prior treatment with either aliskiren, a direct renin inhibitor,
or telmisartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), both
known for their long-lasting efficacy.11,12 The primary
focus of this study was on the 7-day treatment withdrawal
period, following a 12-week treatment period, evaluating
the corresponding changes in brachial BP and central aortic
systolic pressure (CASP), in patients with hypertension.
TheASSERTIVE study previously reported more sustained
control of Br-SBP with aliskiren versus telmisartan in
patients with hypertension,13 following 7-days treatment
withdrawal. In this ASSERTIVE sub-study, we hypothe-
sised that aliskiren would similarly exert more sustained
control of CASP than telmisartan during treatment with-
drawal. Importantly, this paper reports, for the first time,
the impact of treatment withdrawal on brachial BP and
CASP in a randomised clinical trial of BP lowering.
Methods
Study design
This was a sub-study embedded within theAliSkiren Study
of profound antihypERtensive efficacy in hyperTensIVE
patients (ASSERTIVE), the design and primary results of
which have been previously published.13 ASSERTIVE
was a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-
group, multi-centre study. Following a 2-week washout
and 1- to 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were ran-
domised to 2 weeks of active treatment with either once-
daily aliskiren 150 mg or telmisartan 40 mg monotherapies,
and then force-titrated to double the initial dose for 10
weeks.
At the end of the 12-week treatment period, both drugs
were replaced with placebo and brachial and central pres-
sures were measured at days 2 and 7 following treatment
withdrawal. The present analysis focuses on the 7-day
treatment withdrawal period. Details of the run-in and
active treatment periods concerning sitting brachial and
central pressure are presented in the online supplement.
Patients
The ASSERTIVE study included men or women 18
years, with essential hypertension (Grades 1­2), who met
both of the following criteria at randomisation: office sys-
tolic BP(SBP) 140 mmHg and <180 mmHg, and 24-hour
mean ambulatory SBP (MASBP) 135 mmHg. Major
exclusion criteria included the following: severe hyperten-
sion (mean sitting SBP (msSBP) 180 mmHg and/or
mean sitting DBP (msDBP) 110 mmHg), secondary
hypertension, and pregnant women.
The trial was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki, the International Conference on
Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and
the US Code of Federal Regulations, Part 46, Protection of
Human Subjects. The trial protocol was approved by inde-
pendent ethics committees at all centres, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient before
participating in any trial procedures. The trial is registered
as EudraCT no. 2008-007831-41 and on ClinicalTrials.gov
under the code NCT00865020.
Participants in this ASSERTIVE sub-study were
recruited from 45 out of the 111 ASSERTIVE study cen-
tres worldwide. All participants at each centre were invited
to participate (mean participation 95±15% per centre) and
this comprised the CASP randomised dataset (n = 303).
Study assessments
The primary endpoint for this analysis was to compare the
sustained efficacy of prior treatment with aliskiren versus
telmisartan on the change in seated CASP at day 7 follow-
ing treatment withdrawal. Other assessments included
change in (1) seated CASP at day 2 following treatment
withdrawal, (2) seated brachial BP at days 2 and 7 follow-
ing treatment withdrawal, (3) brachial ambulatory BP at
day 7 following treatment withdrawal and (4) evaluation
of biomarkers, plasma renin activity (PRA) and aldoster-
one across the treatment and 7-day withdrawal periods.
Study visits were performed between 07:00 and 10:00 hrs
so that set-up of ambulatory blood pressure measurements
could be standardised across the study.
Brachial BP measurements
Seated brachial BP was measured at the end of the 12-week
treatment period (baseline for this analysis) and on days 2
and 7 following treatment withdrawal. Brachial BP was
measured using a validated and automated BP monitor
(Omron® HEM-705) with an appropriate cuff size, accord-
ing to the European Society for Hypertension Guidelines.15
Briefly, the cuff device was applied on the non-dominant
arm or the arm with the higher reading at screening if there
was a clinically relevant difference (SBP 10 mmHg and/
or DBP 5 mmHg) between arms at the first study visit.
616 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)
Three sitting BP measurements were taken at 1­2-minute
intervals after the patient had been seated for 5 minutes.
The mean of these readings was recorded as brachial BP.
CASP measurements
Seated CASP was measured at the end of the treatment
period (baseline for this analysis) and on days 2 and 7 fol-
lowing treatment withdrawal, using the BProTM device
(HealthSTATS, Singapore). The BProTM device uses
applanation tonometry to capture high-fidelity radial artery
pulse waveforms (RAPWF) at the wrist in blocks of
10-second intervals. RAPWFs were calibrated to brachial
BP measured in the same arm using the OMRON HEM-
705 device, immediately prior to waveform collection.
CASP was derived from the calibrated RAPWFs using a
validated algorithm.16
Ambulatory BP Monitoring
Twenty-four-hour brachial ambulatory BP monitoring
(ABPM) using Spacelabs 90208 (Spacelabs Medical Inc.,
Redmond, Washington, USA) was performed at the end of
the treatment period and on day 7 following withdrawal.
ABPM sessions commenced between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.
and monitors were applied to the non-dominant arm of the
patient, as previously described.13,17 Validity criteria for
ABPM measurements included a minimum test duration
of 24 hours, at least 70% of valid expected BP measure-
ments during the 24 hour duration, and no more than two
non-consecutive hours without readings. If the ABPM
measurement failed to achieve validity criteria at randomi-
sation, a repeat measurement was permitted within 24­72
hours, provided the patient continued to receive placebo
treatment.
Plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels
Blood samples were collected from a subset of patients
prior to treatment initiation, at the end of the treatment
period, and on day 7 following withdrawal. Blood samples
were collected after a fast of at least 8 hours. EDTA sam-
ples were centrifuged within 5 minutes of collection and
plasma was immediately frozen at -20°C for a maximum
of 4 weeks, and then at -80°C at the central laboratory
(Eurofins, Breda, The Netherlands), until assayed. The
biomarker, PRA was assessed using RIA kits from
DiaSorin (Stillwater, Minnesota, USA) and aldosterone
was measured using RIA Coat-a-Count kits from Siemens
(Deerfield, Illinois, USA).
Statistical analyses
In this sub-study, CASP was measured at sub-study base-
line (end of active treatment) and at days 2 and 7 following
treatment withdrawal. However, not all patients had valid
CASP measurements at all sub-study time points. Hence,
two sets of patient populations, based on the extent of
availability of their CASP data, were analysed. The CASP
completer dataset was obtained from participants who had
valid seated CASP measurements at all time points, i.e. at
the end of the treatment period (baseline for this analysis)
and on days 2 and 7 following treatment withdrawal. In
addition, the CASP randomised dataset was obtained from
participants who had a valid seated CASP measurement at
least at one of the above mentioned time points. Changes
from baseline in seated brachial SBP (msSBP), CASP, and
MASBP were analysed using an analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) model with treatment, study region and gen-
der as factors and baseline mean arterial pressure as a
covariate. The primary analysis focussed on changes in
CASP from the end of the 12-week treatment period to
days 2 and 7 of the treatment withdrawal period. Between-
treatment analysis was also performed for changes in
msSBP, CASP and MASBP from baseline to end of the
withdrawal period.
Results
Patient disposition
Of the 1359 patients who entered the placebo run-in period
of the ASSERTIVE study, 822 were randomised to the
aliskiren (n = 414) and telmisartan (n = 408) treatment
groups. Of these patients, 303 (aliskiren, n = 157; telmisar-
tan, n = 146) participated in the central aortic pressure sub
study (CASP randomised set), of whom 94 patients
(aliskiren, n = 49; telmisartan, n = 45) had a valid CASP
measurement completed at every time point across the
treatment withdrawal period (CASP completer set).
Demographic and baseline characteristics
Demographic and baseline characteristics of the sub-study
population were generally comparable between the aliskiren
and telmisartan groups at randomisation for the CASP ran-
domised and CASP completer sets (Table 1).

Changes in seated brachial SBP
In the CASP randomised set, msSBP was similar between
both treatment groups at baseline for the treatment with-
drawalperiod,i.e.attheendofthetreatmentperiod(aliskiren,
138.8±13.8 mmHg versus telmisartan, 139.4±15.9 mmHg,
as shown in Figure 1(a)). At day 2 of treatment withdrawal,
change in msSBP was -0.8±0.9 mmHg with aliskiren and
+2.1±0.9 mmHg with telmisartan, with a significant least
squares mean (LSM) between-treatment difference of
-2.9±1.3 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI): -5.4, -0.4;

drawal period, msSBP remained almost unchanged with
aliskiren (+1.6±1.0 mmHg), but increased with telmisartan
(+3.2±1.0 mmHg). However, LSM change between-treat-
ment difference (-1.6±1.5 mmHg; 95% CI: -4.5, 1.3) was
not statistically significant (p = 0.275).
At baseline for the treatment withdrawal period, mean
sitting brachial SBP (msSBP) was similar between treat-
ment groups in the CASP completer set (aliskiren,
139.6±12.4 mmHg versus telmisartan, 140.2±14.9 mmHg)
(Figure 2(a)). At day 2 of treatment withdrawal, msSBP
changed little (-2.1±1.6 mmHg) with aliskiren, but
increased with telmisartan (+4.1±1.6 mmHg). LSM change
between-treatment difference (-6.3±2.3 mmHg; 95% CI:
-10.8, -1.8) was statistically significant in favour of
aliskiren (p = 0.006). Similarly, across the 7-day with-
drawal period, msSBP remained almost unchanged with
aliskiren (-2.0±1.6 mmHg), but increased with telmisartan
(+5.6±1.7 mmHg). LSM change between-treatment differ-
ence (-7.5±2.3 mmHg; 95% CI: -12.1, -3.0) was also sta-
tistically significant in favour of aliskiren (p = 0.001).
Changes in seated CASP
At baseline for the withdrawal period, mean seated CASP
values were 129.9±16.2 mmHg versus 127.6±14.9 mmHg
for aliskiren versus telmisartan, respectively, in the CASP
randomised set (Figure 1(b)). Two days following with-
drawal, change in mean CASP was -1.9±1.7 mmHg with
aliskiren and +0.4±1.7 mmHg with telmisartan, with LSM
change between-treatment difference of -2.4±2.4 mmHg
(95% CI: -7.1, 2.3; p = 0.324). Mean change in CASP
from baseline following the 7-day withdrawal period was
-0.7±1.2 mmHg for aliskiren. In contrast, an increase in
CASP of +5.5±1.3 mmHg was observed upon telmisartan
withdrawal. The LSM change between-treatment differ-
ence in CASP from baseline to day 7 of withdrawal was
-6.2±1.8 mmHg (95% CI: -9.7, -2.7), which was a statis-
tically significant and potentially clinically relevant differ-
ence in favour of aliskiren (p < 0.0001) (Figure 1(c)). It is
interesting to note that despite a higher baseline CASP
value in the aliskiren compared to the telmisartan group,
mean CASP decreased following aliskiren withdrawal
while it increased upon telmisartan withdrawal across the
7-day withdrawal period in the CASP randomised set.
At baseline for the treatment withdrawal period, mean
seated CASP values were very similar between both treat-
ment groups in the CASP completer set (aliskiren,
129.4±15.3 mmHg; telmisartan, 129.3±15.4 mmHg), as
shown in Figure 2(b). Two days following withdrawal,
mean CASP remained unchanged with aliskiren (-0.8±2.5
mmHg) and increased with telmisartan (+2.1±2.6 mmHg),
the LSM change between-treatment difference being
-2.9±3.7 mmHg (95% CI: -10.2, 4.4; p = 0.436). Mean
change in CASP from baseline following the 7-day with-
drawal period was -0.4±1.6 mmHg for aliskiren. In con-
trast, an increase in CASP of +4.6±1.7 mmHg was
observed with telmisartan withdrawal. The LSM change

between-treatment difference in CASP from baseline to
day 7 of withdrawal was -4.9±2.4 mmHg (95% CI: -9.6,
-0.2), which was a statistically significant and potentially
clinically relevant difference in favour of aliskiren
(p = 0.041) (Figure 2(c)).
Changes in 24-hour ABPM
At baseline for the withdrawal period, MASBP was
133.3±11.6 mmHg and 132.7±12.2 mmHg for aliskiren
and telmisartan, respectively, in the CASP randomised set
(Figure 1(d)).Across the 7-day withdrawal period, MASBP
changed little with aliskiren (+1.9±0.7 mmHg). In con-
trast, an increase in MASBP was seen 7 days following
telmisartan withdrawal (+6.3±0.7 mmHg), with a signifi-
cant between-treatment difference (-4.4±1.0 mmHg; 95%
CI: -6.4, -2.5; p < 0.0001), in favour of aliskiren.
At baseline for the treatment withdrawal period,
MASBP was 135.2±10.5 mmHg and 136.6±11.8 mmHg
for aliskiren and telmisartan, respectively, in the CASP
completer set (Figure 2(d)). Across the 7-day withdrawal
period, MASBP changed little with aliskiren (+1.2±1.1
mmHg). In contrast, an increase in MASBP was seen 7
days following telmisartan withdrawal (+5.5±1.2 mmHg),
with a significant between-treatment difference (-4.3±1.7
mmHg; 95% CI: -7.5, -1.0; p = 0.010), in favour of
aliskiren.
Changes in PRA and aldosterone
levels
Plasma biomarkers were analysed as an indication of treat-
ment response. Accordingly, the response of biomarkers
from end of the treatment period to end of the withdrawal
period is presented.
In the CASP randomised set, PRA levels increased dur-
ing 12 weeks of treatment with telmisartan, while it
decreased in patients receiving aliskiren (Figure 3(a)).
Seven days following treatment withdrawal, PRA returned
towards baseline with both aliskiren and telmisartan in the
CASP randomised set. Similarly, in the CASP completer
set, 12 weeks of treatment was associated with an increase
in PRA for patients receiving telmisartan, whilst PRA was
suppressed in patients receiving aliskiren. Seven days fol-
lowing treatment withdrawal, PRA returned towards base-
line values with both treatments in the CASP completer set
(Figure 4(a)).
In the CASP randomised set, 12 weeks of treatment was
associated with a decrease in plasma aldosterone levels for
both treatments. Plasma aldosterone increased during the
7-day withdrawal period for both treatments (Figure 3(b)).
The increase in aldosterone was greater following with-
drawal of telmisartan compared to aliskiren, which was
statistically significant (p = 0.013). In the CASP completer
set, 12 weeks of treatment was associated with a marked
reduction in plasma aldosterone levels for both treatments.
Plasma aldosterone increased during the 7-day withdrawal
period for both treatments (Figure 4(b)). There was a
greater increase in aldosterone following withdrawal of
telmisartan compared to aliskiren, which did not achieve
significance (p = 0.11). However, the clinical implications
of differences in effect on RAAS components are not
known.
Discussion
This study investigated the effects of simulating a period
of non-adherence to BP-lowering medication on the sus-
tainability of BP control by withdrawing treatment over a
7-day period. Two different treatments inhibiting the

RAAS were used for BP lowering, and the effects of treat-
ment withdrawal on both brachial pressure and CASP are
reported here. The study demonstrates sustained control of
both brachial and central BP even after 7 days of aliskiren
withdrawal in the CASP completer and randomised sets. In
contrast, both brachial and central BP increased gradually
by 4-5 mmHg over the same time period following with-
drawal of telmisartan, indicating a gradual loss of BP con-
trol over the withdrawal period. This is the first reported
data on the effects of treatment withdrawal on both bra-
chial and central aortic pressure and extends the previously
reported observations of differential effects of treatment
withdrawal on brachial BP and 24-hour ambulatory bra-
chial BP in the ASSERTIVE study.13,18
The primary focus of this study was a comparison
between treatments for the change in seated CASP fol-
lowing treatment withdrawal, i.e. from the end of the
12-week treatment period to day 2 and to the end of the
7-day treatment withdrawal period in the CASP com-
pleter patients set. To complement the results from the
CASP completer patients set, we also report changes in
seated CASP following treatment withdrawal in the
CASP randomised set. The primary endpoint showed sta-
tistical significance in favour of aliskiren over telmisar-
tan in the longevity of CASP control, with little change in
CASP during the 7-day period following aliskiren with-
drawal in both CASP completer and randomised sets.
Moreover, data from the present study illustrate that the
pattern of change for brachial BP and CASP was broadly
similar following withdrawal of either treatment. From
this data it would seem that conventional monitoring of
either brachial or central pressure is sufficient to deter-
mine the haemodynamic consequences of treatment with-
drawal as these changes occur in parallel during this
period. This concept is also supported by the pattern of
change for ambulatory brachial BP across the treatment
withdrawal period, which was similar to that seen for
both seated brachial BP and CASP in the CASP com-
pleter as well as in the CASP randomised sets.
With regard to the longevity of BP lowering across the
treatment withdrawal period, aliskiren and telmisartan are
both regarded as long-acting drugs from their respective
classes. As reported previously, both drugs were very
effective in decreasing brachial BP in the overall popula-
tion.19,20 In the present study, both treatments reduced BP
to the same level following 12 weeks of treatment, such
that the baseline brachial and central pressures for the
withdrawal period did not differ between treatment arms.
Moreover, brachial and central pressures remained propor-
tional across the withdrawal period for both treatments, i.e.
there was no evidence of differential effects between the
treatments.
Other studies investigating the influence of simulated
non-adherence have assessed effects only on brachial BP
and have used shorter treatment withdrawal time periods,
typically 24­48 hours. Depending on the treatment regi-
men investigated, these studies have generally demon-
strated short-term maintenance, or partial loss of BP
control with increases of 4-5 mmHg occurring over a short
period of time.19 Data from the present study demonstrate
consistency with previous findings over a 2-day treatment
withdrawal period, and extend the same over a 7-day with-
drawal period, demonstrating loss in both brachial and
central BP control upon telmisartan withdrawal but little
change upon aliskiren withdrawal. These data demonstrate
the sustained duration of action of aliskiren on seated bra-
chial BP, CASP and brachial ambulatory BP across the
prolonged treatment withdrawal period of 7 days.

Persistence in the BP-lowering response to aliskiren
and telmisartan is consistent with the pattern of biomarker
activity monitored across the treatment withdrawal period
in the CASP completer and the CASP randomised sets. As
expected, PRA showed a divergent response over the
12-week treatment period. As demonstrated previously,
up-regulation of PRA was observed following active angi-
otensin receptor blockade,13,21 which results from stimula-
tion of renin secretion in the juxtaglomerular apparatus
(JGA) in response to elevated circulating angiotensin II
levels.22 In contrast, PRA was suppressed during active
treatment with aliskiren, thereby reflecting inhibition of
plasma renin. The extent of inhibition of PRA with
aliskiren was similar to that reported previously.21
Following treatment withdrawal, PRA returned towards
baseline levels; however, the extent of this restoration
appeared to differ between treatments. Thus, at the end of
the 7-day withdrawal period, PRA reduced toward base-
line levels in patients previously randomised to telmisar-
tan, while there were signs of continued PRA suppression
for patients previously randomised to aliskiren.
Active treatment was associated with suppression of
plasma aldosterone levels, which returned to near-baseline
levels at the end of the 7-day treatment withdrawal period
for patients previously randomised to telmisartan. In con-
trast, a trend towards continued suppression of plasma
aldosterone throughout the 7-day withdrawal period was
evident in patients previously randomised to aliskiren.
These data imply sustained inhibition of the RAAS with
aliskiren withdrawal, while RAAS activity was gradually
restored upon telmisartan withdrawal, and is consistent
with other findings using these treatment types.7,13
Persistence in the BP lowering and aldosterone lower-
ing effects of aliskiren over the 7-day withdrawal period is
consistent with tissue localisation studies with this drug.
Animal studies indicate persistent accumulation of
aliskiren in the kidney.23 A tissue distribution study in
humans indicates affinity for lipophilic tissues,11 providing
a likely rational for the sustained effects of aliskiren on
RAAS and BP lowering. Typical half-lives for ARBs have
been reported to be between 5 (eprosartan, valsartan) and
24 (telmisartan) hours. The relatively long half-life for tel-
misartan is consistent with the slow restoration of BP and
biomarker activity in this study.
This study has limitations that must be acknowledged.
Central pressure was measured non-invasively as it was
neither practical nor appropriate to use invasive measure-
ments with frequent visits in this study population. As this
population was late middle-aged and predominantly white
or Asian, these findings may not be applicable to young or
black patients with hypertension. As this was a sub-study
embedded within the ASSERTIVE trial, and as only 94 out
of 303 participants had valid central BP measurements at
every time point, this study was not powered to investigate
the impact of treatment withdrawal on effects beyond BP
lowering, such as cardiovascular outcomes. Therefore, the
clinical implications of the differences observed in BP
upon treatment withdrawal are not known.
In conclusion, we report for the first time the impact of
treatment withdrawal on both brachial and central aortic
pressure, demonstrating that both respond proportionately,
and that brachial BP is a reasonable surrogate for changes
in central pressure following withdrawal of these medica-
tions. The importance of such properties with regard to
cardiovascular protection needs further investigation.
