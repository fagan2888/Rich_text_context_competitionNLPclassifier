Abstract: Objective: We have conducted a study to assess the role of environment on the burden
of maternal morbidities and mortalities among women using an external exposome approach for
the purpose of developing targeted public health interventions to decrease disparities. Methods: We
identified counties in the 48 contiguous USA where observed low birthweight (LBW) rates were
higher than expected during a five-year study period. The identification was conducted using a
retrospective space-time analysis scan for statistically significant clusters with high or low rates by
a Discrete Poisson Model. Results: We observed statistically significant associations of LBW rate
with a set of predictive variables. However, in one of the two spatiotemporal models we discovered
LBW to be associated with five predictive variables (teen birth rate, adult obesity, uninsured adults,
physically unhealthy days, and percent of adults who smoke) in two counties situated in Alabama
after adjusting for location changes. Counties with higher than expected LBW rates were similarly
associated with two environmental variables (ozone and fine particulate matter). Conclusions: The
county-level predictive measures of LBW offer new insights into spatiotemporal patterns relative
to key contributory factors. An external framework provides a promising place-based approach for
identifying "hotspots" with implications for designing targeted interventions and control measures
to reduce and eliminate health disparities.

1. Introduction
The Research Center on Health Disparities, Equity, and the Exposome employs a transdisciplinary,
external exposome framework. This framework integrates diverse data for exposure assessment and
uses sophisticated tools and methods, such as spatial analytics, Geographic Information Systems (GIS),
spatiotemporal and computational models to identify health disparities "hotspots" among and within
subpopulations in order to design place-based, public health interventions. Geographically-targeted
interventions to break the chain of disparity in a subpopulation and the indicated geographic
region are needed to support public health decision-making and policies. In previous work [1],

we applied the external exposome framework to a subset of a previously established multidimensional,
spatiotemporal data repository of county-level health, socioeconomic, and environmental measures
obtained from publicly available sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Census Bureau, Health Resources and Services
Administration (HRSA), etc.
The external exposome approach builds on the work of Wild [2,3], who first coined the term
"exposome" as a measure of the totality of life-long environmental exposures on health. It also
addresses the need identified by Payne-Sturges and Gee [4] for a model to test empirically the
interrelations between social, physical, and built environments and health disparities. In this
current effort, we applied an external exposome framework, geographic information systems, and
spatiotemporal models to study the interrelationships between multiple health and environmental
dimensions and several health outcomes among women.
1.1. Background
Low income, African American women who do not complete high school, and present later in
their pregnancy for prenatal care, have a higher than average prevalence of unintended pregnancies
and higher than average rates of pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities [5]. They also have
higher prevalence of overweight/obesity, alcohol use, exposure to second hand smoke before and
during pregnancy compared to non-Hispanic White women, lack preconception care, have limited
access to other healthy reproductive and sexual practices or are disproportionately affected by chronic
diseases that negatively impact pregnancy outcomes [6­10]. Over the last 50 years, the risk of death
from pregnancy complications for African American women was four times higher than for White
women [11]. From 1990 to 2008, the maternal mortality rate among African American women in the
United States nearly doubled [12]. Between 2006 and 2009, maternal mortality rates by race were
11.7 deaths per 100,000 live births for White women and 35.6 deaths per 100,000 live births for black
women. Studies suggest that between 20%­50% of these maternal deaths were preventable [13].
The top five causes of maternal mortality were embolism, hemorrhage, preeclampsia and eclampsia,
infection, and cardiomyopathy [14]. Tucker et al. [11] examined the prevalence of common pregnancy
complications and associated fatality rates. African American women also were found more likely to
have preexisting medical conditions (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, asthma, connective tissue disease,
human immunodeficiency virus, genitourinary infections, and periodontal disease), have unintended
pregnancies, and to be publically insured and/or Medicaid eligible due to pregnancy [15]. While the
number of deaths from hemorrhage has declined in recent years, deaths from pulmonary embolus and
hypertension have not [16].
1.2. Infant Mortality, Premature Birth, Low Birthweight, and Maternal Morbidities
In 2007, the infant mortality rate for African American women nationally was 2.4 times the rate
for White women [17]. The leading cause of infant death among African American women was short
gestation and/or low birthweight (LBW) [17]. Increased risk of infant mortality has been associated
with lower socioeconomic status, lower educational attainment, decreased access and utilization of
prenatal care, maternal stress, infections, and experiences of racism [18]. These factors, however, only
partially explain racial/ethnic disparities in infant mortality [19].
The risk of premature birth is particularly heightened among women with a previous premature
birth, multiple pregnancy, cervical or uterine abnormalities, and certain lifestyle factors. The number
of African American women with LBW infants (less than 2500 g) is nearly two-fold compared to white
women. Recent reports link LBW with a number of adverse health outcomes later on in children's
life, including low cognitive performance, learning disabilities, lower height-for-age, and increased
risks of mortality and/or morbidity [20­24]. Numerous epidemiological studies have identified key
contributing factors, such as maternal age, parity, weight gain, smoking, premature birth (less than
37 weeks gestation) as being responsible for LBW outcomes [21,23,25].
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 13 3 of 14
While the increasing rate of pregnancy-related mortality is alarming, severe maternal morbidities
are 50 times more common [17]. Rates of racial and ethnic disparities in maternal morbidities were
three to four times higher for African American women than for White, Hispanic and Asian American
women [18]. Known risk factors for severe maternal morbidities included increased maternal age,
self-pay or Medicaid coverage, low socioeconomic status, and preexisting chronic medical conditions.
African American women who become eligible for Medicaid due to pregnancy often have delays in
seeking prenatal care or have difficulty finding providers who accept Medicaid. It is well documented
that women who do not receive or begin prenatal care after the first trimester have an increased risk
of pregnancy-related complications compared to women who receive timely prenatal care [12]. If an
African American woman is uninsured or enters pregnancy with chronic medical conditions, the risk
of pregnancy-associated morbidity is increased.
The majority of women of reproductive age in the United States are overweight or obese [19],
with African American women having an increased risk of obesity [15]. Obesity is associated with
a variety of adverse pregnancy complications including cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, and
preeclampsia [19]. Interestingly, low socioeconomic status (SES) is not associated with increased
maternal morbidities among African American women. These risk factors only partially explain
the disparities in maternal morbidities in African American women [18]. When African American
and White women present with the same comorbidities (i.e., hypertension, diabetes, asthma, human
immunodeficiency virus), African American women fare worse in pregnancy than White women [15].
Bruce et al. [20] found that the five most common maternal complications were urinary tract infections,
anemia, mental health conditions, pelvic and perineal complications, and obstetrical infections.
Compared to other racial and ethnic groups, African American women have a greater proportion of
pregnancies that were associated with at least one of these complications.
The underlying causes of the disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities are
complex and have proven difficult to unravel. While many individual risk factors associated with
poor pregnancy-related outcomes are known, the complex spatial/temporal nature of the relationships
between health outcomes, environmental exposures and population level disparities are not yet well
understood. Environmental factors that have been previously identified include characteristics about
health care providers, access to a timely, culturally competent prenatal care, and exposures found in
the natural, built, social, and policy domains [26]. Though significant progress has been made, some
gaps still persist in pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities literature partly because many of the
factors are interwoven, complex, and poorly understood. Besides, most studies on pregnancy-related
morbidities and mortalities have relied heavily on hospital administrative data and do not assess
clinical, environmental exposures, or systems level factors or account for complications that are treated
in outpatient settings [27,28].
Figure 1 provides a conceptual exposome framework for understanding adverse birth outcomes.
This framework consists of the external and internal exposome domains, health outcomes and risk
factors, and analytical tools, methods, and strategic goals for revealing novel patterns and insights.
Although a number of recent studies have been conducted in this emerging exposome area, there is
still little information on geographically-integrated health measures. In this study, we have reviewed
genetic factors that are specific to the internal exposome domain or are reported to be associated with
preterm birth, reduced head size, infant birthweight, and premature birth. Non-genetic factors that
make up the external exposome domain and are specific to this application include, health outcomes,
health behaviors, clinical care, socioeconomic, policy and programs, and the physical environment.
The framework, which combines exposome, the use of GIS and spatial analysis, spatiotemporal
models, computational and traditional statistical analytics, is applied to study the complex relationships
of LBW across U.S. counties. The framework addresses the total life span of individuals in relation to
their exposure and offers a better way to examine contributory factors, and thus may provide new
insights. The objective of this paper is to assess geographic variation and role of environment on the
burden of LBW among women for the purpose of developing targeted public health interventions
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 13 4 of 14
to decrease disparities. We used spatiotemporal models to identify counties in the 48 contiguous
USA where observed LBW rates were higher than expected during a five-year study period. This
was conducted using a retrospective space-time analysis scan for statistically significant clusters in
counties with high or low rates by a Discrete Poisson Model. The findings from this study could be
used to develop targeted, public health interventions to decrease disparities. The findings can also
serve as a basis for designing multilevel culturally-situated interventions to address ethnic disparities.
Interventions that incorporate geographic parameters provide a more promising approach and will
yield geographically targeted, optimal control and preventive strategies to reduce ethnic disparities in
pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities.

Exploring Low Birthweight Variations Using Powerful Spatiotemporal Models
For this study, we used the 2010­2014 County Health National Data compiled by the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation and the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute (http://www.
countyhealthrankings.org/). The two institutions have developed a robust list of health measures at
county-level since 2010. Most of their health variables/measures are derived from the Behavioral Risk
Factors Surveillance System survey and U.S. Census Bureau. Air quality monitor data comes from
the Public Health Air Surveillance Evaluation project. This project was a collaborative effort between
the CDC and EPA, which yielded a robust spatiotemporal model for estimating fine particulate matter
concentrations throughout the year. The downloaded datasets were processed using Microsoft Excel
(Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) and ArcGIS 10.2.2 (ESRI Inc., Redlands, CA, USA). Descriptive

same software packages. But the ordinary least square (OLS) models were generated using IBM SPSS
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 13 5 of 14
Version 22 (SPSS Inc.; IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA) and the spatiotemporal models were created using
SaTScan (developed jointly by Kulldorff M., Boston, Massachusetts and Information Management
Services, Inc., Silver Spring, MD, USA). The best OLS and spatiotemporal regression models were
created after conducting a comprehensive screening and exploratory analysis of 47 variables of interest
(see Table 1). All diagnostic statistics were analyzed for all the models, including model fitness and
collinearity results.
Modeling the relationship between low birthweight and contributory factors followed a two-step
process. The first step was the development of six OLS models. In the second step, we used Kulldorff's
retrospective Space-Time Statistics to determine whether high or low rates of LBW were randomly
distributed in the United States over space and time. For all of these models, we assumed that LBW
reported at county-level in the 48 contiguous USA (3109 counties) was dependent on the 47 predictor
variables during the study period.
We constructed five regression models for each year (2010­2014) to explain the link between LBW
and predictor variables. Each of the reduced models had between 12 and 17 predictor variables that
were influential. Consequently, 17 predictor variables were used to create the overall regression model
for LBW for the entire period. Upon compilation and synthesis of the model results, we determined
that only nine influential predictors consistently explained LBW outcomes in all five of the models that
were created. Using this new knowledge, we developed two retrospective spatiotemporal models for
LBW outcomes.
3. Results
Table 2 gives the OLS model outputs for LBW and the most influential predictors, with some
being statistically significant at each time point. The best overall model yielded an R2 of 0.705 based
on backward stepwise regression criteria. The R2 results for each of the years were quite close to one
another: the 2010 model was 0.650, the 2011 model was 0.659, the 2012 model was 0.668, the 2013 model
was 0.647, and the 2014 model was 0.639. In addition, we observed a general improvement in the R2
value and fitness statistics for the overall model. Nine influential predictors were temporally consistent
and able to explain LBW variations in all the five models. These predictors included ambulatory care
sensitive conditions discharge rate, teen births rate, percent of adults 18­64 without insurance, percent
of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, age-adjusted years of potential life
lost rate, percent of white, percent of Native Americans, and percent of Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.

Figure 2 shows spatiotemporal clusters of LBW over a five-year study period. The nine covariates
for the first spatiotemporal model included: teen birth rate, percent of adults without insurance, percent
of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, percent of diabetic Medicare
enrollees receiving HbA1c test, days with unhealthy fine particulate matter, days with unhealthy ozone,
percent of adults who smoke, and percent of African American population. The five covariates for the
second spatiotemporal model included teen birth rate, percent of adults without insurance, percent of
adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, and percent of adults who smoke.

Figure 2 shows spatiotemporal clusters of LBW over a five-year study period. The nine covariates
for the first spatiotemporal model included: teen birth rate, percent of adults without insurance,
percent of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, percent of diabetic Medicare
enrollees receiving HbA1c test, days with unhealthy fine particulate matter, days with unhealthy ozone,
percent of adults who smoke, and percent of African American population. The five covariates for
the second spatiotemporal model included teen birth rate, percent of adults without insurance, percent
of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per month, and percent of adults who smoke.
The higher and lower than expected LBW rates in the first model incorporate two environmental quality
variables that were found to be statistically significant.

In the first spatiotemporal model, we identified one statistically significant spatiotemporal cluster
of LBW that was located in Henry County, Alabama. In the second spatial model, we identified
two statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters of LBW that were located in Greene and Henry
Counties, Alabama. Henry County was detected by both models. In the two models, it was evident that
LBW outcomes appear to be partly explained by these covariates, which further lend support to the
interaction and complexity of social, behavioral, and environmental factors.

Thirty-seven percent of the counties in the spatiotemporal model had annualized low rates of
birthweights of 6237 per 100,000 live births (relative risk 0.76, log likelihood 13,612.97, p < 0.0000001)
while 28 percent of the counties had annualized high rates of birthweight of 10,943 per 100,000 live
births (relative risk 1.37, log likelihood 26,772.39, p < 0.0000001). The remaining 35% of the counties
in the model were statistically insignificant. Overall, the main areas of concern with elevated risk of
LBW were identified in the southern and mid-western regions of the United States, it is especially
pronounced in the counties of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, Arkansas, Tennessee, South
Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, West Virginia, Ohio, Virginia, New Mexico, Texas, and Colorado.
Demographically, the racial/ethnicity composition of counties with elevated LBW risk comprises 65%
white, 17% African American, 10% Hispanics, and 8% others. However, these counties also have the
largest proportion of African Americans (i.e., about 67% of the total population of African Americans
in the 48 contiguous state).
Furthermore, we identified three trajectories of LBW outcomes during the spatiotemporal
modeling process (Figure 2). The first trajectory was observed between 2011 and 2014, this trajectory
was associated with higher rates of LBW outcomes and was present in all the counties; the second
trajectory was observed between 2010 and 2013, this trajectory was associated with lower rates of LBW
outcomes and was present in all the counties except south Texas and counties that lie at the intersection
of New York and Connecticut state boundaries; and the last trajectory was a set of outliers observed
between 2010 and 2012, this trajectory represented counties with lower rates of LBW outcomes. These
were identified in counties in south Texas (mostly Hispanics) and counties lying at the boundaries of
New York and Connecticut states.
4. Discussion
For this study, LBW was used as a proof of concept to apply GIS and spatial analysis,
spatiotemporal models, and traditional statistical analytics to an external exposome. The county-level
predictive measures of LBW offers new insights into spatiotemporal patterns relative to key
contributory factors. The findings in this study provide further evidence and are consistent with
previous studies that have identified socioeconomic [29­35], behavioral [36­38], and environmental
factors [39­43]. By means of our external exposome approach, we observed that LBW rate was more
strongly associated with 17 variables. We consistently observed the influence of nine predictors in
all the five models (ambulatory care sensitive conditions discharge rate, teen births rate, percent of
adults 18­64 without insurance, percent of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per
month, age-adjusted years of potential life lost rate, percent of White, percent of Native Americans, and
Percent of Hawaiian or Pacific Islander). In some of the years, there were notable variations suggesting
the changing influence of some of the predictors. However, after accounting for place as an explanatory
variable, we identified LBW associations with five socioeconomic variables (teen births rate, percent of
adults 18­64 without insurance, percent of adults that report BMI  30, mentally unhealthy days per
month, and percent of adults who smoke) in two counties (Greene and Henry Counties in Alabama);
all the counties identified with higher than expected LBW rates were also significantly associated with
two environmental quality variables (ozone and fine particular matter).
It was evident from the county-level health measures that the southern portion of the United States
has consistently experienced poor pregnancy-related outcomes during the study period spanning from
2010 to 2014. The spatiotemporal models provide further evidence of LBW hotspots and are driven by
a mixture of key socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors. Furthermore, the profiles of
10/14
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 13 11 of 14
two counties with statistically significant spatiotemporal clusters of LBW were consistent with prior
Alabama's Department of Public Health Annual Reports of 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. According to
Alabama's Health Disparities Status Report of 2010, the disparity has worsened from 82% higher in
2000 to 92% higher in 2008 for African Americans when compared to Whites. The racial/ethnicity
composition of Greene County consists of 86% African Americans; while, the composition of Henry
County is 31% African American. Both of the counties are situated in the rural part of Alabama, where
many hospitals lack basic health care services such as obstetrical services (Alabama Department of
Public Health Annual Report 2013). Greene County was ranked last in the state health report due to
poor health indicators. In this report, Greene County's low weight births increased from 9.4 percent in
2001 to 16.7 percent in 2011 (Alabama Department of Public Health Annual Report 2013).
Within the south, we recommend place-based targeted interventions to prevent and control
pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities with the target being low income, unmarried, African
American women. We believe such intervention measures will have an effect of a set of socioeconomic,
behavioral, and environmental factors and improve pregnancy-related health outcomes. In addition,
we recommend efforts to prevent and control identified risk factors should be implemented before and
during pregnancy, because there are likely to have an impact on perinatal health outcomes.
In spite of the key insights derived from this study, there are some limitations that must be
recognized because there is no prefect model. First, some of the measures in this study are derived from
either objective or subjective reports. Second, health behavior measures are not adjusted in the county
ranking data. There are other concerns that are related to temporal misalignment; large units may
mask differences within areas; and small numbers problem. In the future, as more accurate secondary
longitudinal data becomes readily available, we expect to use it to refine our spatiotemporal models.
5. Conclusions and Implications
The causes of pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities are numerous and include a broad
array of factors from across multiple environmental domains. The development of a multi-level,
multi-dimensional surveillance system is needed to increase our understanding of the broad array of
risk and protective factors associated with pregnancy-related morbidities and mortalities.
The external exposome approach and tools provide a theoretically agnostic, data driven model
that holds considerable promise as an alternative to traditional, discipline-specific, hypothesis-driven
models for understanding health disparities. It supports both data-driven and hypothesis-driven
approaches, and can be used both to generate and to test hypotheses. An external exposome
approach offers new ways for conceptualizing the underlying causes of health disparities and the
biological pathways through which environmental exposures affect human development and health.
By incorporating spatial and temporal dimensionalities, an external exposome framework provides
a data structure that accommodates a life span approach, a cumulative risk model, and extended
periods between exposure and expression and detection of a disease. Furthermore, an external
exposome approach is able to incorporate methods and analytics from various disciplines and can
handle multiple types of data with varying spatial and temporal dimensions. This approach holds
considerable promise in unraveling the complex nature of health outcomes and disparities data.
The multi-dimensional nature of this approach can support a broad array of analytics including
predictive modeling, simulation, Bayesian networks, and structural equation modeling, which can
be used to produce network of hypotheses concerning factors that might be manipulated to improve
pregnancy-related disparities.
An exposome framework has implications for identifying populations at greatest risk for health
disparities and for increasing our understanding of the underlying molecular pathways through
which environmental exposures affect human health and development and result in disparities at a
population level. It holds great promise for the deployment of place-based, targeted interventions that
are responsive to local risk factors that underlie protracted disparities in pregnancy-related morbidities
and mortalities and other diseases. While this paper uses county level data to describe the link between
11/14
Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2016, 13, 13 12 of 14
health outcomes and external exposome, the approach can be readily scaled spatially and temporally
to address other units of analysis (e.g., neighborhoods). Applying an external exposome approach can
assist in developing and targeting interventions to those at greatest risk.
Future Directions
This analysis will be applied to three other pregnancy-related [32] morbidities and mortalities
(infant mortality rates, maternal mortality, and prematurity) in future studies. While data presented in
this paper are cross-sectional in nature, we are currently working on methods to apply this general
approach to the analysis of longitudinal data. In addition, we will continue to expand and harmonize
additional datasets to incorporate into the current model. This line of research should help unlock the
explanatory and predictive power of innovative methods such as those we have discussed here.
