Objective: To determine the prevalence, characteristics, and
impact of arthritis in the US nursing home population.
Methods: A national cross sectional sample of US nursing
homes (8138 sampled residents in 1406 nursing homes)
from the 1997 National Nursing Home Survey provided
demographic and functional characteristics for residents with
primary arthritis, any arthritis, or no arthritis diagnosis at
admission.
Results: Of the estimated 1.6 million current nursing home
residents in 1997, only 43 000 (3%) had a primary and
300 000 (19%) had any arthritis diagnosis at admission.
People with a primary or any arthritis diagnosis received
physical/occupational therapy, used wheelchairs and walk-
ing aids, and needed assistance with walking and transfer-
ring more often than those with no arthritis diagnosis.
Conclusions: These national estimates suggest that arthritis is
underreported in nursing home residents. Because arthritis
contributes to an increased physical burden on staff and
decreased functional capability of residents, both staff and
residents can benefit from better diagnosis, intervention, and
education.
An estimated 70 million American adults had arthritis or
chronic joint symptoms in 2001,1 and the number of
people over age 65 with arthritis is expected to double
by 2030.2 The prevalence and impact of arthritis in nursing
homes is not well characterised. The purpose of this study is
to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of
people with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions in the
nursing home population.
METHODS
Data were obtained from the 1997 National Nursing Home
Survey. A two stage probability sample of 1488 nursing
homes was selected from a list of 17 900 nursing homes
representing all US nursing home residents 3; 1406 homes
(94%) participated in the survey. The survey consisted of
three questionnaires: a facility questionnaire, a current
resident questionnaire, and a discharged resident question-
naire. Data from the current resident questionnaire were
used in this study. During an onsite visit, an interviewer and
the facility administrator (or designee) created a sampling
list of all current residents and six residents were randomly
selected from the list, resulting in a total sample of 8138
residents.
Detailed information on each resident (demographic
characteristics at admission, date of admission, source of
payment currently and at time of admission, current
functional status, and the primary and up to five other
diagnoses at admission) was obtained through interview
with the nursing staff provider most knowledgeable
about the resident's care. No residents were directly inter-
viewed.
Current residents with arthritis were identified by a
standard set of International Classification of Disease, 9th
revision­Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) diagnostic codes
developed by the National Arthritis Data Workgroup4 to
represent a wide variety of arthritis and other rheumatic
conditions.
Age was obtained either directly from the resident's chart
or calculated by subtracting the resident's year of birth from
the year of admission. Race/ethnicity was categorised as non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and other. Other
characteristics included sex, the Metropolitan Statistical
Area (urban v rural) of the sampled facility and the level of
care received (skilled, intermediate, or residential).
Functional characteristics included participation in physical
or occupational therapy, use of a wheelchair, use of a walking
aid (including a walker, cane, or crutches), and the need for
assistance in each of five activities of daily living (bathing,
dressing, eating, walking, and transferring).
Three arthritis diagnostic subsets of this population were
defined: residents with primary (first listed) arthritis
diagnosis, residents with any arthritis diagnosis (any of six
diagnosis fields), and residents with no arthritis diagnosis at
admission. Estimates of each characteristic were obtained by
weighting eligible records to represent all nursing home
residents by using the inverse of the probability of selection
adjusted for non-response, and over- or undersampling to
determine statistical weights.
Actual sample numbers, as well as estimated population
numbers and percentages, were calculated for each descrip-
tive characteristic. Confidence intervals (95% CI) for the
percentages were calculated with use of relative standard
errors derived from published coefficients.3 An estimate was
considered unreliable and therefore not reported if the
sample size was less than 30. An estimate is considered
potentially unreliable and flagged if the sample size is
between 30 and 59 or if the sample size is 60 or more and
the relative standard error is greater than 30%.3
RESULTS
In 1997, there were an estimated 1 609 000 nursing home
residents. At admission, 43 000 (,3%) of these residents had
a primary arthritis diagnosis, over 300 000 (,19%) had any
arthritis diagnosis, and 1.3 million had no arthritis diagnosis.
Characteristics varied among the three diagnostic subsets
(table 1). Women constituted 86% of residents with a
primary arthritis diagnosis at admission, 81% of those with
any arthritis diagnosis, but only 70% of those with no
arthritis diagnosis. Similarly, residents aged 85 years and

older and non-Hispanic whites represented a greater percen-
tage of those with a primary or any arthritis diagnosis than of
those with no arthritis diagnosis. Level of care was similar in
all three diagnosis subsets.
A significantly higher percentage of residents with a
primary arthritis diagnosis received physical and/or occupa-
tional therapy than in the other groups (fig 1). Those with
primary or any arthritis diagnosis used wheelchairs and
especially walking aids more than those with no arthritis.
For activities of daily living, those with primary or any
arthritis diagnosis at admission needed assistance with
walking and transferring more often than those with no
arthritis diagnosis at admission, but they required less
assistance with eating.

DISCUSSION
Of all nursing home residents in 1997, only 3% had a primary
arthritis diagnosis and 19% had any arthritis diagnosis at
admission, a far smaller percentage than the 50% of people
aged 65 years and older with arthritis in the civilian non-
institutionalised population.5 This marked discrepancy may
have several causes. Firstly, there may be overreporting in the
general population, but multiple surveys have found a similar
or greater prevalence of arthritis. Secondly, there may be
underreporting of arthritis in nursing homes. Prete and
Phan found that musculoskeletal disease was more pre-
valent when determined from a complete musculoskeletal
examination by a rheumatologist than from examination by
a primary care giver or from self report, with mild to
moderate disease not being recognised.6 They also found that
very old people may underreport their musculoskeletal
complaints even with direct aggressive inquiry, possibly
because they believe that aches and pains are a normal part
of aging or because they are so used to accommodating their
disease that they no longer recognise it as a hindrance.
Thirdly, the low rate of arthritis may be real, perhaps because
arthritis has a protective effect on nursing home admissions.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are
commonly used to treat arthritis, have been found to a have
significant inverse relationship with Alzheimer's disease.7­9
Because Alzheimer's disease is a common reason for nursing
home admissions, people with arthritis who take NSAIDs
may be less likely to be admitted to nursing homes for this
condition.
Residents with diagnosed arthritis, particularly those
with decreased mobility, have an increased impact on
nursing home staff because they require more assistance
with ambulation and daily tasks. Residents with undiag-
nosed arthritis may be placing similar but unrecognised
physical demands on staff. For the residents with either
diagnosed or undiagnosed arthritis, reduced mobility results
in decreased muscle strength and poor cardiorespiratory
function. Consequently, more falls and injuries may occur as
well as increased morbidity due to diseases related to
inactivity such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and some
cancers.10
Although more residents with diagnosed arthritis receive
physical/occupational therapy than those without arthritis,
the relatively low rate of these effective interventions may
represent a missed opportunity.11­13 Przybylski et al conducted
a randomised controlled programme evaluation that looked
at the effect of increasing the number of full time physical
therapists (PTs) and occupational therapists (OTs) per bed in
nursing homes.13 They found that not only was one PT/OT per
50 beds more effective at promoting, maintaining, or limiting
decline in functional status than was one PT/OT per 200 beds
but also that the 1:50 group required less care giver
involvement and less overall care delivery resources than
the 1:200 group, resulting in a net benefit even when the
costs for PT/OT were included. Prevention of disability, or
limiting the progression of disability, can have a profound
impact on not only the individual person's quality of life but
also on the workload of nursing home staff, the economic
structure of the facility, and the economics of the healthcare
industry.
This study has at least three possible limitations. Firstly,
nursing home residents with arthritis may be overlooked
because the National Nursing Home Survey collects informa-
tion on only six admission diagnoses, and arthritis may be
``bumped'' off that list for people with seven or more
conditions. However, the probability of this happening is
probably minimal because only 29% of sampled residents had
all six slots for admission diagnoses filled. Secondly, some
residents with a primary arthritis diagnosis might have been
admitted temporarily after joint replacement surgery and
thus would not represent a long term nursing home problem,
but we lacked data to determine this. Thirdly, the survey
information may be incomplete because the reporting
nursing staff provider who knows the resident best may
not know the selected resident very well or, in the absence of
medical record documentation, may not recall some details of
the resident's care because of the number of patients in his or
her charge. The primary strength of this study is that it is a
large, nationally representative sample that fills a gap in our
knowledge of arthritis epidemiology and provides a profile of
diagnosed arthritis in residents that might direct future
nursing home research.
Arthritis is a large and probably underrecognised problem
in nursing homes. People diagnosed with arthritis place
greater physical demands on nursing home staff, and
undiagnosed arthritis is probably adding to that burden.
Staff and residents both may benefit from greater
physical and occupational therapy to prevent progression.
In addition, other non-pharmacological interventions,
such as self management education (Arthritis Self-Help
Course) and physical activity programmes (``People
with Arthritis Can Exercise'' and the ``Arthritis Foundation
Aquatics Program''), are effective at reducing pain,
improving function, and decreasing the risk of disability14
in the general population and may help in nursing homes as
well.

Laboratory imposed restrictions on ANCA testing

Testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) is useful for patients with
Wegener's granulomatosis or other systemic vasculitides. When laboratories accede to
all requests for ANCA testing however, the results may be difficult to interpret or
irrelevant because more than half of positive tests are in patients who do not have a systemic
vasculitis. In Portsmouth, UK a policy of selective testing has been in place for ten years and
has resulted in more focused requesting of ANCA tests by clinicians.
The laboratory has performed ANCA testing only when the request form indicated one of
the following conditions; acute or chronic renal failure, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's
granulomatosis (established or suspected), proteinuria or haematuria (requests from the
renal/transplant unit), Churg-Strauss syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, abnormality on chest
x ray or lung biopsy, haemoptysis, perforation of the nasal septum, or Henoch-Schonlein
purpura. (Scleritis, prolonged sinusitis, and sudden hearing loss have recently been added to
the list.) Requests not conforming to this list are refused initially but can be discussed.
During the six months of June to January 2000 there were 287 requests for ANCA testing.
Two hundred and eight (72.5%) were regarded as appropriate and 75 were refused. (Four
requests made in person by a consultant were allowed although they would not otherwise
have been regarded as appropriate.) In 1991­2, before the introduction of selection, 508
ANCA tests were done and the total number of routine autoimmunity tests (including
rheumatoid factor, antinuclear, antithyroid, anti-endomysium, antismooth muscle, anti-
mitochondrial, anticardiolipin, and antidouble stranded DNA antibodies) was 12068 (4.2%
ANCA). In 2002­3 there were 930 ANCA requests out of a total of 38543 (2.4%). The
calculated saving in laboratory costs was £2000 per year.
Two years after the end of the study all laboratory data subsequently accumulated for the
287 study patients was reviewed. Among the 75 patients who had ANCA testing requested
but not performed only one patient had had a diagnosis of systemic vasculitis (Wegener's
granulomatosis). Her ANCA testing had been delayed by only two days however, because a
second sample had been sent with the information, ``episcleritis/haematuria and
proteinuria''. Of the 212 ANCA tests done 57 (27%) were positive, 37 for cytoplasmic
ANCA and 20 for perinuclear ANCA. Forty two of the 57 patients proved to have an ANCA
related vasculitis (43 Wegener's, five microscopic polyangiitis, and two Goodpasture's).
Since the introduction of the selective policy there have been fewer `inappropriate'
requests for ANCA testing. Clinicians have been `educated' (but the renal/transplant unit
was apparently a major source of requests and one of the three authors of this paper was a
consultant renal physician). The authors maintain that their policy makes testing more
efficient and clinically relevant as well as saving money.
