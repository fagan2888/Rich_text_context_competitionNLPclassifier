Introduction
Writing is recognized as a vital skill in education and the
workplace; students in the United States finishing K-12
schooling are expected to be competent writers (Bromley,
2011; Genlott & Grönlund, 2013; Hansen & Wills, 2014;
K. Harris, Graham, Friedlander, Laud, & Dougherty, 2013;
Salahu-Din, Persky, & Miller, 2008). However, George Leef
(2013), an educational columnist, commented that young
American students graduate from high school with "pathetic
abilities" in crucial areas: reading and writing. Tyre (2012),
when discussing the consequence of American students not
knowing how to write, stated that "when students don't learn
how to articulate ideas, their options erode--and our whole
society is worse off for it" (para. 1).
Teachers serve as a crucial link in the move to improve
literacy skills of K-12 students; however, teachers them-
selves are underprepared to be writers and writing teachers
(Bentham, Sinnes, & Gjøtterud, 2014; Chukwu, 2014;
Darling-Hammond, 1997). Leef (2013) commented that one
of the key reasons why high school graduates could not
write well was that many of their teachers were not very
good themselves. For example, in a case study of three
California colleges' education programs, Hochstetler (2007)
found that first, most teachers were not taught how to write
in K-12 schools nor in the university; second, they were not
taught how to teach writing in teacher preparation nor in
professional development; and, third, the materials they
were provided with to teach writing when they did enter the
profession were, at best, only peripherally related to writing,
and writing instruction.
The need for improving the effectiveness of writing
teachers is underscored by a recent evaluation conducted by

Rising to the Challenge: What Practicing
Teachers Learned From a Process-Based
Writing Project in a Graduate Capstone
Seminar
Xiaoping Li1 and Mingyuan Zhang1
Abstract
Writing is recognized as a vital skill in education and the workplace; students in the United States finishing K-12 schooling
are expected to be competent writers. Yet, the Nation's Report Card found that U.S. high school graduates coming into the
workforce are particularly deficient in writing skills. Teachers serve as a crucial link in the move to improve literacy skills
of K-12 students; however, teachers themselves are underprepared to be writers and writing teachers. Therefore, there is
an urgent need to improve teachers' writing skills and skills of teaching writing to improve K-12 students' writing skills in
the United States. This qualitative study examined the process-based writing project experienced by 22 practicing teachers
through their reflective practices in a graduate capstone class. In particular, this study explored the challenges the teachers
faced and the lessons they learned through the recursive phases of writing: planning, drafting, revising, editing, conferring, and
publishing. The triangulation of the researchers' field notes, teachers' daily reflections, and informal interviews between the
instructor and the teachers indicated that the challenges the teachers faced and the lesson they learned through the process-
based writing project were phase specific. On the completion of the writing project, the participating teachers (a) developed
a deep understanding of process-based writing; (b) learned new skills of planning, drafting, revising, editing, and sharing; and
(c) were more confident as writers themselves and as writing teachers for their students.

the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP),
which indicated that only 24% of the students in Grades 8
and 12 in the United States could write at a proficient level
(National Center for Education Statistics [NCES], 2012).
According to The Nation's Report Card: Writing 2011
(NCES, 2012), students performing at this level need to
clearly demonstrate the ability to accomplish the communi-
cative purpose of their writing. Nevertheless, the remaining
three quarters of the students performed at basic or below
basic levels.
As faculty members in an education graduate program at
a large Midwest 4-year public university, we set as one of our
goals to prepare graduate students who were practicing K-12
teachers for the professional challenges ahead. In particular,
we believe it is important for practicing teachers to develop a
deep understanding of the writing process with first-hand
experience and confidence in their abilities to write, and
teach writing. To do this, we constructed a process-based
writers' workshop model for a research writing project in a
capstone course to find out the challenges the practicing
teachers would face and the lessons they would learn, which
may shed some light on how to improve the effectiveness of
writing teachers for K-12 students.
Process-based writing approach has been utilized in post-
secondary writing programs (J. Harris, 1996; K. Harris et al.,
2013; Miller, 1993; Woo, Chu, & Li, 2013; Yuknis, 2014) for
more than three decades. While Ken Macrorie (1985) out-
lined the practices of process-based writing pedagogy 30
years ago, Lannon's book on the writing process approach
has reached the 11th edition in 2012 (Lannon, 2012). The
key components of process-based writing include students
engaging in cycle of activities, starting from brainstorming
to outlining, from peer-reviewing to editing and publishing.
They write with real purposes for real audiences, and the
project could last a period of time (Barnhisel, Stoddard, &
Gorman, 2012; Graham & Perin, 2007).
The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the
process-based writing experienced by 22 practicing K-12
teachers through their reflective practices in completing
a research writing project in a graduate capstone class.
In particular, this study explored the challenges the teachers
faced and the lessons they learned through the recursive
stages of writing: planning, drafting, revising, editing, and
publishing.
Review of Literature
Process-Based Approach to Writing
The International Reading Association (2009), the National
Writing Project (2014), and the National Association for the
Education of Young Children (NAEYC; 2013) all endorsed
the process-based writing approach for learning how to
write. Solley (2000) gave a historical perspective on the
teaching of writing when writing was taught in school as a
product, not a process. Teaching of the process-based writing
began in the early 1970s when Emig (1971) began studying
the writing process of high school students. Calkins,
Ehrenworth, and Lehman (2012) extended the writing
process model into the writers' workshop model by adding
conferring and publishing to the process.
The process-based writing approach requires students to
produce a paper in several phases, each phase receiving sig-
nificant instructor and/or peer intervention. Although phases
of process-based approach vary (Ferris & Hedgcock, 2013),
it could include pre-writing activities, first draft, revising,
editing, conferring, revising subsequent drafts, and pub-
lishing. The phases are recursive (Artunduaga, 2013; Kolb,
Longest, & Jensen, 2013; Koutsoftas & Gray, 2013) in that
for each phase writers receive feedback--suggestions on
how to improve and how to better achieve the goals of the
assignment.
Among the advantages of process-based writing approach
is that it fosters writing competency in students that is trans-
ferrable not only between courses but also within a wide
variety of writing situations. Process-based writing can make
it easier for learners to import the skills and practices they
have learned into new contexts (Guy, 2009).
Furthermore, Street and Stang (2008) found that 79% of
the teachers who participated in a semester-long process-
based writing course reported that they felt more prepared
to teach writing, had an increased understanding of writing,
were more confident writers themselves, felt better prepared
and more comfortable giving guidance and feedback, and had
an increased ability to assign and grade writing assignments.
Genre-Based Approach to Writing
Genre, according to The Bedford Glossary of Critical and
Literacy Terms (Murfin & Ray, 2003), is "the classification
of literacy works on the basis of their content, form, or tech-
nique" (p. 189). For centuries, works have been grouped
according to a number of classificatory schemes and dis-
tinctions, such as prose/poem, fiction/drama, and comedy/
tragedy. Recently, genres have been categorized based on the
purposes of writing. Derewianka (1990) identified six main
school types according to their primary social purposes: (a)
narratives: tell a story, usually to entertain; (b) recount: tell
what happened; (c) information reports: provide factual
information; (d) instruction: tell the listeners or readers what
to do; (e) explanation: explain why or how something
happens; and (f) expository texts: present or argue a view-
point. The Common Core State Standards (National
Governors Association Center for Best Practices & Council
of Chief State School Officers, 2010) grouped different
genres into three major types of writing, namely, argumenta-
tive writing--to persuade, informational writing--to inform,
and narrative writing--to convey experience.
Genre-based approach to writing goes hand in hand with
process-based approach and has become a prevalent topic in
Li and Zhang 3
textbooks for teaching writing to advance the Common Core
State Standards (e.g., Fredricksen, Wilhelm, & Smith, 2012;
Smith, Wilhelm, & Fredricksen, 2012; Wilhelm, Smith, &
Fredricksen, 2012). The aforementioned authors have pub-
lished a series of textbooks on narrative, informational, and
argumentative writing, introducing many genre-specific
strategies. K-12 teachers have also adopted genre-based
writing approach (Ramos, 2014). Ramos (2014) described
how English as a second language (ESL) and content area
teachers can use the genre-based Reading to Learning
approach to support adolescent English learners (ELs) in
learning to write in an academic way. Kohnen (2013) and
Donovan and Smolkin (2011) reported successful teaching
experiences in applying genre-specific strategies with stu-
dent writing; while Kohnen focused on informational writing
in high school science, Donovan and Smolkin focused on
elementary-level informational writing.
Regardless of the different approaches to teaching writing
and different ways to categorize genres, there are common
principles all effective writing teachers need to follow to
help their students develop beliefs about the nature of writ-
ing. Drawing from the theory and practice of teaching genre,
Duke, Caughlan, Juzwi, and Martin (2012) have identified
five guiding principles to teach genre-based writing, which
echo the process-based writing approach described in the
previous section:
1. Design compelling, communicatively meaningful
environment.
2. Provide exposure and experience.
3. Explicitly teach genre features.
4. Explicitly teach genre-specific or genre-sensitive
strategies.
5. Offer ongoing coaching and feedback
Feedback From Writing Instructors
Feedback from writing instructors, as a key component in the
process-based approach to writing, plays an important role in
improving student's writing (Feuerherm, 2011; Gulley,
2012). Past research tends to survey student perceptions of
the feedback from the instructors and action taken in response
to such feedback (McMartin-Miller, 2014; Stellmack,
Keenan, Sandidge, Sippl, & Konheim-Kalkstein, 2012).
However, how writing instructors think of the right way to
provide feedback and how they actually provide feedback
had seldom been described. Dana Ferris (2010, 2014) and
Ferris, Brown, Liu, and Stine (2011) recently conducted a
series of research studies on the topic, which received the
attention of both researchers and writing instructors.
One revealing result from Ferris's (2014) study was that
there was variation across the instructors and discontinuity
between their self-reported feedback principles and their
actual practice. Specifically, while writing instructors were
being interviewed, they described their response principles
of providing multiple-draft responses, indicating students
would receive one or multiple-time feedback from the
instructors. But further examination revealed that most of the
feedback for the preliminary drafts was from fellow students
via in-class peer reviews. The format of such peer reviews
was often rubric handouts or feedback forms; seldom was
there a special training session to prepare students for the
peer review. Another finding of practice discontinuity was
that when assessing the importance of teacher­student con-
ferences, all instructors agreed on its importance and effec-
tiveness, but in practice, many instructors reported that they
did not have enough time to run such conferences and only
met with the students who visited them during office hours.
The recommendations by Ferris (2010, 2014) and Ferris
et al. (2011) concur with those by Montgomery and Baker
(2007) that while most writing teachers recognized the prac-
tice of providing feedback on both local and global issues
throughout the writing process, they should concentrate on
global issues on first drafts and local issues on subsequent
drafts. The writing instructors in the study actually gave far
more feedback on grammar and mechanics on student papers
than they reported in their survey. Such an approach does not
follow the recommendations for balanced feedback on global
and local issues, depending on the needs of each students,
text,andtask(Diab,2011;Ferris,2014;Glenn&Goldthwaite,
2013; Lee, 2008, 2011, 2014).
Peer Revising and Editing
MacArthur (2013) defined peer revising and editing as a
common feature of writing process classrooms and it was
often recommended as a way of providing student writers
with an audience of readers to respond to their writing,
identify strengths and weaknesses, and recommend
improvement.
Graham and Perin's (2007) milestone meta-analysis of
writing instruction for adolescent students reported, among
others, on the effects of peer assistance as a strategy of scaf-
folding students' writing controlled against students who
wrote alone. The seven effect sizes for peers working together
to plan, draft, and/or revise their compositions were positive.
Collective arrangements where students worked together to
help each other with one or more aspects of the process writ-
ing had a strong and positive impact on writing quality.
To enhance the effectiveness of peer assistance, it was
suggested that peer revision be integrated with instruction in
evaluation and revision (Philippakos, 2012). Specifically,
when students were given a rubric for evaluating their class-
mates' writing and shown how to apply it to evaluate strong
and weak papers and make suggestions, the peer evaluation
was more effective and meanwhile the student reviewers also
improved the quality of their own writing.
Stellmack et al. (2012) described the traditional approach
of review­revise­resubmit procedure. In this approach,
instructors tell the students what is wrong with the paper, and
4 SAGE Open
students revise according to the instructions from the instruc-
tor. Stellmack et al. challenged the effectiveness of this
approach by stating that any improvement in the grades after
the review­revise­resubmit procedure might only be an indi-
cation that "a student has successfully responded to the feed-
back of the grader and has satisfied the grader to some extent
in revising the paper" (p. 244). Their research results show
that when blinded, graders who were not provided the origi-
nal feedback often perceived less improvement across drafts
and frequently perceived no change or a decrement in writ-
ing quality across drafts.
Some recent studies attempted to look into the nature of
the feedback during peer revision. Guasch, Espasa, Alvarez,
and Kirschner (2013) reported on what type of feedback best
improves the quality of peer revision and editing in an envi-
ronment based on asynchronous written communication.
Their results revealed that epistemic feedback and suggestive
feedback best improved the quality of revision performance.
The Benefits of Teachers as Writers
Teachers as writers are endorsed in numerous research stud-
ies (Kaiser, 2013; Olthouse, 2012; Randles, 2012). The argu-
ment is that in perusing their own writing lives, teachers will
inform and enhance their writing pedagogy (Dawson, 2009;
Gallavan, Bowles, & Young, 2007; Whitney et al., 2012). As
Penny Kittle (2008) pointed out, "I now believe you really
can't teach writing well unless you write yourself" (p. 7).
There are many books and articles targeting teachers and
teacher educators, claiming that teachers who write know
writing strategies better, have stronger ability to empathize
with student writers, and have valuable understandings about
writing (Calkins et al., 2012; Kittle, 2008; Pytash, 2013).
Much of this literature on teacher-writers emphasized
pedagogical methods which teachers can make use of in their
own writing processes, experiences, and products in the
classroom. Dierking and Fox (2013) examined how contact-
ing with other professionals in intensive week-long sessions
as well as mentoring from the professional development
coach affected the practicing teachers'concept of themselves
as writers, as well as how this attitudinal change affected
their classrooms and students.
Many researchers looked at preservice teachers to assess
their understanding as writers (e.g., Hall & Grisham-Brown,
2011; Zimmerman, Morgan, & Kidder-Brown, 2014). They
found that preservice teachers did not enjoy writing, had a
difficult time visualizing themselves as being effective writ-
ing teachers, and lacked confidence as writers and future
teachers of writing. Pytash (2013) reported in her research
results that initially the science preservice teachers did not
have knowledge of specific instructional approaches to teach
writing. Through her instruction, the science preservice
teachers engaged in critical and analytical reading and writ-
ing, which enhanced their knowledge of how to write and
how to teach writing.
Washburn, Matesha, and Binks (2011) reported that pre-
service teachers often entered English language arts teacher
preparation courses with fears of writing and teaching writ-
ing due to neutral or bad experiences as K-12 students.
Stockinger (2007) provided extensive modeling of writing
through a semester-long methods course involving authentic
writing experiences, peer group discussions, extensive
opportunities for reflection, and a 30-hr field component in a
local elementary school wherein participants worked with
small groups of elementary-student writers. Stockinger
reported in the research how preservice students developed
positive, clear images of themselves as writing teachers.
Morgan (2010) also reported that preservice teachers
have a strong sense of themselves as writers along the good­
bad writing dichotomy. Her preservice teachers, at the end
of the writing methods class, identified four instructional
strategies: (a) reading like a writer, (b) having similar writ-
ing experiences in class as their future students, (c) writing
regularly in a topic of their choice, and (d) designing writing
mini-lessons.
While the process approach to writing instruction is one
of the most popular methods for teaching writing, most of the
research studies were conducted at K-12 school settings and
for preservice teachers (Graham & Sandmel, 2011; Morgan,
2010). There have been research studies at the graduate-level
course on technical writings for a statistics course (see K. M.
Collins, Onwuegbuzie, & Jiao, 2014), and on how to enhance
the writing in a qualitative research course (see Sallee,
Hallett, & Tierney, 2011). However, studies examining how
the process approach to writing instruction is taught at the
graduate-level educational course are scarce. This study
explored the challenges the 22 practicing teachers faced and
the lessons they learned through the recursive phases of writ-
ing: planning, drafting, revising, editing, conferring, and
publishing in a graduate capstone class.
Research Methodology
Participants
The 22 participants in this study were matriculated graduate
students in a master of arts in education program in a 4-year
public university in the Midwest region of the United States.
Ten of these students were elementary school teachers, 10
were middle school teachers, and 2 were high school teach-
ers. The classroom experience of the teachers ranged from 4
to 19 years. There were 19 females and 3 males. Their ages
ranged from 26 to 52 years.
All participants were native English speakers; none of
them were bilingual, and a few had learned Spanish in sec-
ondary school. As for research writing, all of them had writ-
ten many papers for graduate-level courses for their master's
degree. However, all the writing emphasized the end-
product, with handing in the paper at the end of the semester
as normal practice. Seldom was there any multiple-draft
Li and Zhang 5
experience in the graduate courses. When being informed of
this research writing project, they were all unsure of how
exactly the process-based writing would unfold.
Course Description
This course, titled Master of Arts Capstone Seminar is one of
the last courses of the master's degree in education. The
course prepares students for a 4-hr long comprehensive
examination on multiple K-12 educational topics called the
Capstone Examination. This course specifically requires stu-
dents to have an in-depth study of a topic developed with
input from the student's master's degree advisor, and
approved by the instructor of the course. It must reflect the
results of a substantial review of the literature obtained
through the research methodologies the student has learned
during the master's program, and the tools to which the stu-
dent has been introduced during the Capstone Seminar
course. The final paper must be a synthesis of the work from
the student review of the literature and relevant course work.
This culminating research project should not only illustrate
the abilities of the individual student to collect and report
information on a topic of special interest and relevance to
classroom teachers but also reflect plans for specific applica-
tions to classroom practices.
This course was normally conducted in a seminar format,
preparing students to conduct research on a specific educa-
tional topic. Usually, students engaged the research individu-
ally, and at the end of the course, they shared the research
findings with classmates. This traditional product-based
method brought plenty of pressure on students; a majority of
students felt as if they were fighting an individual war, with
no connection and communication with their fellow class-
mates, nor a sense of belonging to a learning community.
As a result, students struggled and produced low-quality
research papers. The outcome of such methods was unsatis-
factory both to faculty members and students. A call for
change was both necessary and urgent.
The instructor of this course decided to approach the writ-
ing project with new strategies based on her own teaching
experience and an extensive literature review on process-
based writing, teachers-as-writers, and benefits of peer
revision and editing. The key strategies adopted included (a)
helping students gain their identity as writers and the owner-
ship of the writings, (b) engaging research in a process-based
approach rather than product-based approach, and (c) build-
ing a learning community in peer mentoring, revising, and
editing.
The instructor believed that such strategies, when prop-
erly implemented, would have long-term positive effects on
these practicing teachers (Guasch et al., 2013; Kaiser, 2013;
Kittle, 2008; Olthouse, 2012). The strategies, meanwhile,
would make teachers feel more confident in their abilities to
write, and therefore, teach writing. This research writing
project was completed during a 6-week summer course where
students wrote a 20-page, double-spaced synthesis of litera-
ture review. The process-based writers' workshop model
followed the five phases.
Phase I: Topics and Questions--Generating Ideas
Phase II: Sources and Syntheses--Building Knowledge
Phase III: Putting It Together--Drafting
Phase IV: Revising and Editing--Peer Mentoring
Phase V: Finalizing and Sharing--Publishing
To help the participating teachers see how the process-
based writing approach moved from phase to phase, we used
the concept of advanced organizers by Ausubel (1963, 2000)
to design a flow chart (Figure 1) to show the phases used in
this writing project.
These phases in the flow chart may appear linear; how-
ever, they are actually recursive (Artunduaga, 2013; Kolb
et al., 2013; Koutsoftas & Gray, 2013). When we observe a
writing process in action, we will find that rehearsing, draft-
ing, and revising occur again and again during the whole
writing process. When the writer is drafting, one continues
to discover, recall, and revise. Therefore, writing is a tre-
mendously complex process involving recursive application
of a wide range of thinking skills, linguistic abilities, and
knowledge base.

project.

Data Collection and Analysis
The purpose of this study was to examine the challenges the
22 graduate students faced and the lessons they learned
through their reflective practices in a graduate capstone
class. Multiple sources of data were collected and analyzed
and they include (a) instructor's field notes derived from
observation and informal interviews between the instructor
and the students before, during, and after class; (b) graduate
students' daily reflections; and (c) all capstone research
project-related written assignments including outlines,
drafts, and final versions of the paper.
For the purpose of data collection, nine written assign-
ments and nine daily reflections were designed based on the
phases of the process-based writing approach. Each student
submitted the assignments listed below. All assignments
were in written format and were required to be submitted to
the course Blackboard, and later were all exported and
archived in the first author's personal computer for coding
and recoding:
1. Draft capstone research question and reflection sheet
2. Ten journal articles and reflection sheet
3. Annotated bibliography of the articles and reflection
sheet
4. Ten journal article synthesis charts and reflection
sheet
5. Research topic outline and reflection sheet
6. First draft and reflection sheet
7. Second draft and reflection sheet
8. Third draft and reflection sheet
9. Final research report and reflection sheet
(see Appendix A for a sample assignment and reflection
sheet).
The first author of this article was the instructor of the
course, and acted as a participant of all class activities. She
collected the data via participant observation (field notes,
informal interview before, during, and after class). Participant
observation is a routinely used method in qualitative research
(Fraenkel, Wallen, & Hyun, 2014).
The informal interviews by the first author before, during,
and after class were written down as field notes. Some were
written down on the spots, some were written down immedi-
ately after the interviews, and some were written down after
the day's class was over. All notes were individually and
chronologically recorded in accordance with the phases of
the process-based writing approach.
To ensure reliability and validity of the instructor's field
notes, triangulation and member checking techniques for
qualitative research studies were utilized (Fraenkel et al.,
2014). Triangulation refers to the use of different data sources,
time periods, and data collection methods that result in simi-
lar findings (McMillan & Wergin, 2009). We collected gradu-
ate students' daily reflections, their written assignments, and
the instructor's field notes based on observation and informal
interviews before, during, and after class, and it was found
that the field notes corroborated the data derived from the
analysis of the graduate students' daily reflections and their
written assignments.
The second technique utilized to ensure reliability and
validity is member checking, which refers to the practice of
submitting researchers' field notes to the participants to ver-
ify whether their perspectives have been recorded accurately
(McMillan & Wergin, 2009). After all field notes were indi-
vidually and chronologically recorded, they were sent back
to respective participants for accuracy check. The participat-
ing teachers were invited to make notes on the printouts if
they found any discrepancies. All discrepancies were recti-
fied before the data coding and recoding process began.
A grounded theory approach was used in this data analy-
sis (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The aim of grounded theory is
to generate or discover a theory (Charmaz, 2014). Grounded
theory is defined as "the discovery of theory from data
systematically obtained from social research" (Bryant &
Charmaz, 2007). We believed that the grounded theory
approach was a good fit for two reasons. The first reason is
that the essence of the grounded theory is that it takes an
inductive pathway to the phenomenon of the study (Stern &
Porr, 2011)--we did not have any pre-determined positions
to prove or disprove about what and how students might
respond cognitively and emotionally to the process-based
approach to the writing project. The second reason is that as
data collection progressed, we were able to detect patterns
and discern meanings from the student subjective experience
by using the main analysis techniques of the grounded
theory: open coding and recoding, and repeated constant
comparisons. The triangulation of graduate students' daily
reflections, their written assignments, and the instructor's
field notes based on observation and informational interview
before, during, and after class was used to strengthen the
credibility and validity of the findings.
Because grounded theory emerges as a result of data
analysis, the triangulated data were cast onto a matrix that
followed initial coding and recoding (Tracy, 2013). The
authors of this article adopted an inductive stance and strived
to derive meanings from the data (Creswell, 2012; Hennink,
Hutter, & Bailey, 2010). After several rounds of initial cod-
ing and recoding, we found several themes within the data.
Each author independently coded the data using those
themes. To establish inter-rater reliability, we compared our
coding. To address any differences in coding, we re-ana-
lyzed the data together, shared our thoughts, and resolved
all differences, thus establishing agreement in coding
for themes. When we began to map out the findings, they
showed a close parallel with the phases of writing pro-
cesses; so it was agreed on by the authors that the best way
to present the findings was to follow the process-based
writing phases and embed the themes that emerged from
the analyses within each phase.
Li and Zhang 7
When describing validity and reliability in qualitative
research, the term "rigor" is often used instead (Lincoln &
Guba, 1985). As stated by Thomas and Magilvy (2011),
"rigor are ways to establish trust or confidence in the find-
ings or results of a research study" (p. 151). The model of
trustworthiness of qualitative research proposed by Lincoln
and Guba (1985) addressed four components of trust-
worthiness that were relevant to qualitative research: (a)
truth-value (credibility), (b) applicability (transferability),
(c) consistency (dependability), and (d) neutrality (con-
firmability). We used this model to emphasize the rigor of
data collection and analysis.
To establish credibility, we reviewed the researcher's
field notes derived from observation and informal interviews
before, during, and after class; student reflections; and the
many writing drafts by students to look for similarities and
patterns within and across study participants. To establish
transferability, we provided detailed descriptions of the
demographics of the participants of the study, the questions
asked for student reflection, and steps taken by the course
instructor for each phase of the writing processes. All these
endeavors make it possible for researchers with similar inter-
ests to use the information to further examine this important
topic in different populations. To establish dependability, we
provided detailed descriptions of data collection procedures,
and had both authors participate in the analysis process.
When there were discrepancies in the results of analysis, we
reviewed the data and the coding and recoding details to
reach a consensus. The last component of the model is con-
firmability, which, according to Thomas and Magilvy (2011),
will occur when credibility, transferability, and dependabil-
ity have been established. One key part of confirmability is to
have the researchers of the study reflect on how their own
preconceptions might affect the research and do the best to
lessen the possible impact. We made a conscious effort to
follow, rather than lead, the direction of the reflection by ask-
ing the participants to clarify the points they were making
both in interviews and written reflection. Great attention was
paid to the rigor of the research, and the model of trustwor-
thiness recommended by Lincoln and Guba (1985) was
followed from the conceptualization through the completion
of the research.
Research Findings
In the following sections of the article, we present the find-
ings based on the five phases of the process-based workshop
model.
Phase I: Topics and Questions--Generating Ideas
During Phase I of the process-based writers' workshop, the
teachers in the class chose a topic and wrote a capstone ques-
tion to study for the rest of the semester. The process used to
assist teachers in choosing and writing a capstone question
was instructor modeling and student brainstorming. The
instructor used key words "Critical Literacy" as an example
to start the modeling process by answering questions on four
key areas in the following organizer (Figure 2).
At the end of Phase I, all students had chosen a topic and
written on specific areas of their interest. Some of the topics
included,
·
· Integrated Curriculum in Middle School
·
· A Comparison of Full-Day Versus Half-Day
Kindergarten
·
· Single Gender Schools
·
· Best Middle-Level Science Practices
·
· Peer-Led Literature Discussion Groups
·
· Equity in the Mathematics Classroom: Ensuring All
Students Succeed
Here is an example of a capstone question following the
graphic organizer by a student:
My Topic: Using Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy
Skills (DIBELS) as an Assessment of Early Literacy Skills
In this era of No Child Left Behind, educators are looking for
assessment tools to evaluate the early literacy skills of their
young students. Many schools are employing the DIBELS
program as a measure of students' growth and achievement.
What are the components of the DIBELS assessment program?
What are the reliability and validity of the DIBELS measurement
tools? What challenges do classroom teachers face to implement
the use of DIBELS? How can teachers effectively use DIBELS'
results to support early literacy skill development? (Sheila)
When reflecting on the most difficult part of writing a
capstone question, the teachers' reflections fall into three
themes. They are (a) how to find a topic that was not too nar-
row, yet not too broad; (b) how to put thoughts into words;
and (c) how to write an informative lead sentence despite
lack of prior knowledge.
Figure 2. Graphic organizer with four key areas.
8 SAGE Open
In this initial phase of the process-based writing work-
shop, they learned that (a) reviewing the literature was a
necessary part of finding a research topic; (b) writing a cap-
stone question required multiple layers of thinking; and (c)
creating a topic included (i) defining the topic, (ii) looking
at prior research, (iii) dealing with problems associated with
the topic, and (iv) making the scope of the capstone question
manageable. Here are some thoughts expressed through the
reflection journals of the students and informal interviews
with the first author.
On the Effectiveness of Using the Graphic Organizer:
I learned that writing a capstone question was not as difficult as
I thought it would be as long as I followed the graphic organizer
given in class along with the class examples. The professor's
modeling and visual aids helped me see how I could find my
topic of interest and replicate the format shown to produce my
own capstone question. (Dana)
I was fearful of not being able to organize my thoughts for this
paper. Being introduced to the flowchart and the prompts helped
me immensely as it began to make sense how I can structure the
paper. (Cheryl)
On the Uncertainty of the Topic:
It's okay to tweak it if you've started your research and realize
that it's taking you in a slightly different direction than you
initially planned on going. (Angela)
Will my capstone question stay the same or will it change as I
perform more research? I am not yet sure if I will be able to find
enough information to answer the questions I have created.
(Sarah)
On Connecting With Their Own Teaching:
Strategies provided by the professor can be easily applied to my
students in my own teaching. I see a parallel between the
difficulty of my own topic searching and that of my high school
students in finding topics for their research. (Michelle)
I liked the process the professor used in helping me find a
research topic. I will employ similar strategies in supporting my
students to choose their research topics. (Ben)
Based on the process-based approach of writing, we
believed teachers'concerns at Phase I were natural and mostly
resulted from a lack of prior knowledge of the topic. We
emphasized the process-based writing model and tried to
reassure the teachers that the writing was recursive and
nothing was final at this early phase. We used the analogy of
writing being like planting a seed and the seed (topic) will
develop through its life stages. It was well accepted by most
of the teachers. Teachers'reflections indicated that the graphic
organizer we provided proved to be an effective tool that
helped students sort their ideas and finalize a research topic.
Phase II: Sources and Syntheses--Building
Knowledge
There are two components in this phase. For the first compo-
nent, teachers were requested to conduct an online library
search to find 10 journal articles related to their topic. All
articles needed to be from refereed journals, no older than 8
years except 1 or 2 classic articles, and had at least eight
pages as most feature articles in journals are about 6,000 to
7,000 words and about eight or more pages. Those require-
ments were to guarantee the journal articles were current and
of high quality.
To assist teachers in identifying 10 research articles, we
accompanied them to the university computer lab, and
modeled using electronic educational databases such as
Education Full Text (EBSCO) and the Education Resources
Information Center (ERIC). The instructor's sample research
topic Critical Literacy: A Critical Component in Literacy
Development was used as the example for conducting educa-
tional database search. The instructor demonstrated how to
use these two educational databases and record the reference
information. The instructor also showed students a variety of
ways of using different combinations of key words for con-
ducting online search and showed that a simple change in the
search term, such as the order of search terms, could lead to
major changes in the search result. Teachers were able to
look thoroughly into their individual topics and were amazed
at the amount of information available. For instance, the term
"critical literacy" in EBSCO resulted in 2,514 entries. They
were all able to locate 10 or more articles and write annotated
bibliographies of the 10 articles to submit and share with
classmates. This online library database search enhanced
teachers' ability to conduct independent research--a key
skill toward becoming a researcher (Helms & Whitesell,
2013).
When reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for
this phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes: (a)
coming up with the search terms that would yield the best
results, (b) locating quality research articles that met the
page and year requirements, and (c) deciding which of the
many articles to read. They learned that (a) when doing
searches, it was best to start broad and narrow down from
there, and (b) it was helpful to look at the related searches
that the search engine suggested based on the original search.
On the Experience of Finding Research Articles:
The most difficult part of finding 10 research articles was
coming up with the search terms that would yield the best
results. I started out with "integrated curriculum" and that
brought more than one thousand hits. I then narrowed it down
with "middle school" but that made the focus too narrow. I then
thought to look at the related terms that were on the bottom of
the detailed records and that helped the search a lot. I have
learned that when searching it is best to start broad and then
narrow down from there. (Kendra)
Li and Zhang 9
I would like to find out if the Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early
Literacy Skills (DIBELS) is used only in the United States or if
it is used in other countries. I would also like to see how my
school compares to the national average in achievement rates on
the DIBELS measures, but that may have to wait until after this
paper is complete. (Sheila)
I have created my capstone question that I am trying to answer
and not all of the articles on my topic were directly related to my
questions. It was difficult to meet the criteria for choosing
journal articles. Sometimes it may have been a good article but
it did not have enough pages nor current publishing dates. It was
also difficult to find articles that were directly related to my
specific topic. I need to experiment with more and different
terms. (Ben)
At the end of this component of Phase II, we felt that
teachers were on the right track for the writing project. We
noticed that many quality journal articles were located, and
teachers had made good progress in knowledge building for
their respective topics. The annotated bibliography helped
them use more standard terms for their topics. We also
noticed some modifications of topics by some teachers.
Individual conferences were conducted with teachers to
assist them in developing a clear focus of their topics.
The second component of this phase was to synthesize the
articles. This was a significant step of the research writing
project based on the process-based writers'workshop model.
Bloom's (1956) taxonomy defined information synthesis as
the process of combining elements or parts to form a pattern
or structure not clearly there or seen before. Students often
confuse synthesis with summary (Megwalu, 2013). Whereas
a summary involves condensation of ideas or information to
highlight main ideas (J. Collins, 2012), synthesis involves
examining, reducing, breaking down, and assimilating infor-
mation to see emerging points of view (Megwalu, 2013).
To assist students in synthesizing research, we designed
an Inquiry Chart (I-Chart; Table 1), which consists of four
columns/questions: (a) definition/dimensions/principles,
(b) research support/evidence/effects, (c) challenges/needs/
issues, and (d) solutions/strategies/applications. The I-Chart
was based on the research by Assaf, Ash, Saunders, and
Johnson (2011), Buehl (2013), and Hoffman (1992). With
the I-Chart, students became more independent and the
search became an inquiry process.
As in Phase I, we modeled and guided the strategies in the
class first and then let teachers do the charts on their own.
See Appendix B for a sample I-Chart.
With one I-Chart for each journal article, we laid a solid
foundation for our teachers to use multiple sources that pro-
vided a variety of information for their writing. We found
that the three most difficult parts of creating inquiry charts
for the teachers were (a) condensing all the articles into a few
key points so that the charts did not become overwhelming,
(b) organizing relevant articles with other focus that did not
fit the I-Chart well, and (c) technical challenges of reading
through research articles that were full of charts, graphs,
and statistics. They learned that creating a research synthesis
chart was a great way to organize information in a research
project and showed enthusiasm for implementing such a tool
in their teaching.
On Connecting With Their Own Teaching:
I learned a great way to organize information in a research
project. It is important to read through articles with focus on
what you are looking for. When you know the purpose and main
topics of research, it would be easy to put information into
categories on a chart. This is definitely something that I could
use with my middle school students. I have used a chart for
research in the past with my students but it really just had two
columns: source and information. I think it would be great to
divide the chart into more specific columns to categorize the
information. (Leanne)
I also found it difficult to put notes down instead of just
highlighting articles for future use. This is something that I have
asked my students to do during a research project, so I have a
much more appreciation for the work they were involved in
now. I think it will be helpful in the actual writing process of the
paper, but it took a couple of articles before I was to put notes
down with ease. (Kendra)
At the end of this phase, we experienced much more posi-
tive feedback from the class with teachers making major
progress in their writing of the capstone paper; more impor-
tantly, they seemed to become more patient and resilient. We
saw and heard less complaints and observed more readiness
by teachers to dig deeper into the topics; some teachers added
more articles to their collection than required. I-Chart played
a key role in helping teachers succeed with the synthesizing
component. At this point, the pre-writing was complete and
we felt the process-based writing so far was successful;
teachers made significant progress both as writers and in
their perception toward writing. The big picture of the pro-
cess writing began to sink in and the teachers were ready to
move on to the next phase.
Phase III: Putting It Together--Drafting
Using synthesized information from I-Charts to write the
first draft is a critical phase in completing a quality capstone
research writing project. To assist teachers with the first
draft, we paid great attention to the process that teachers
were recommended to follow. An effective way to organize

information in the I-Charts was to create a bare-bone road-
map outline that reflected the synthesized information. This
bare-bone roadmap outline was different from the prelimi-
nary brainstorm-based one in Phase I of the writing process
(Yeh, Lo, & Huang, 2011); the I-Chart-based outline is a
roadmap that is rich in information, rooted in the research
conducted in earlier writing phases, and will provide a solid
foundation for a quality first draft.
With the 10 I-Chart syntheses based on 10 journal
articles, teachers created a roadmap outline such as the
following:
Topic: Critical Literacy:ACritical Component in Literacy
Development
 I. Introduction to Critical Literacy
II.
Critical Literacy: Definitions, Dimensions, and
Principles
III. The Need for Critical Literacy in the Classroom
IV.
Challenges to Incorporating Critical Literacy for
Teachers
V. Strategies for Teaching Critical Literacy
VI. Conclusion
Based on this process, teachers learned that each outline
needed to reflect the nature of the particular topics they were
working on, but there might be some common components
that appeared in most of the outlines, such as Introduction,
Implications, and Conclusions. With further discussion and
analysis of the bare-bone outline and information from the
I-Chart, a more detailed, full-version outline was created (see
Appendix C).
When reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for
this phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes.
They are (a) resisting the urge to spend too much time on
details such as wording, paragraphing, and referencing; (b)
being overwhelmed with the full version outline; and (c)
finding it a challenge to write a decent first draft, using the
synthesized I-Charts. They learned that (a) their research still
had gaps and they would need to keep reading and searching
for more articles and books to fill in the gaps, (b) an effective
way to write the first draft was to write one section at a time
following the full-version outline, and (c) the full-version
outline could still be revised to meet the overall objectives
better.
One problem some teachers ran into is, due to various rea-
sons, they had not completed the I-Charts for their 10 journal
articles from the previous phase. Therefore, they felt that the
time should be spent on getting more research done rather
than working on the first draft.
On Jumping Around the Phases of Writing:
My biggest challenge with this assignment is seeing the value in
it. I would never choose to write a first draft before my research
is anywhere near done. I feel as though my time could have been
spent much better by focusing on doing more reading instead of
putting my notes from one form into another. I bet that I have not
had enough time to process all the information I have gathered
yet to make a coherent, well-thought-out first draft. Tardiness is
my worst enemy now. (Adam)
On Connecting With Their Own Teaching:
With my students we often talk about the writing process. Many
students struggle to get their initial ideas down because of their
perfectionist tendency. We talk about how a first draft does not
need to be perfect and I model for them the process; however,
when it comes to my own work, I am occasionally guilty of not
practicing what I preach. Writing the first draft helped to
reinforce for me the fact that writing is a process. It is often only
through the process of writing that you can discover what you
want to say and how you want to say it. (Sonia)
What we learned from these reflections is that we must
emphasize the importance of the timeline. All assignments
designed for each phase of the writing process must be com-
pleted on time. We need to make it very clear to future stu-
dents that any delayed completion of assignments for each
phase will inevitably jeopardize the next phase's assignments
and therefore affect the writing project negatively.
Phase IV: Revising and Editing--Peer Mentoring
To assist teachers with their second draft, we first had them
share it in their groups, and then had the group members pro-
vide suggestions using the stars and wishes method. Stars
and wishes is a strategy used in K-12 classrooms to enhance
peer feedback where students identify two positive aspects of
the work of a peer and then express a wish about what the
peer might do to improve the work (Davies, Cameron,
Politano, & Gregory, 1992). We revisited the concept of
learning community during this phase (MacPhail, Patton,
Parker, & Tannehill, 2014). Although peer discussion and
feedback were routine activities, the revision and editing
phase called for a higher sense of community learning. We
set up the revision format as a self-selected two-person team.
To ensure the peer mentoring responsibility was fulfilled,
checklists were created for team members to follow and all
feedback from team members were recorded and evaluated.
More importantly, a series of short training sessions were run
to prepare the teachers to ensure quality peer evaluation
(Ferris, 2014). The stars and wishes strategy was welcomed
by all teachers even though they knew the strategy was com-
monly used for younger students. The non-threatening nature
of the strategy worked well with adult learners, too.
Then, we did two mini lessons: (a) how to organize the
research paper and (b) how to use transitional paragraphs,
sentences, and words. Another round of intensive peer revi-
sion and editing followed. Finally, we sent teachers to work
on their third draft.
Li and Zhang 11
When reflecting on the most difficult part of writing for
this phase, the teachers' reflections fall into three themes.
They are (a) putting the ideas together and attempting to
make it flow using translational words, (b) struggling with
the whole notion of "research writing" in general, and (c)
staying on topic. They understood that they had made con-
siderable progress, but still had a long way to go; and they
needed to go back and reread some of the sources to find
some additional information even though it was already the
second draft.
On the Importance of Revising and Editing:
When I finished writing the first draft I was feeling really good
about myself. Little did I know, it wasn't that great. When
I read back through it to revise and edit for my second draft,
I found a lot of confusing parts and sections that needed to be
reorganized. I found it helpful to do this editing and revising
on a hard copy rather than on the computer screen. I think that
the activity we did in class with regard to organizing sentences
and paragraphs along with the mini-lesson on transition words
was very helpful. I thought of it a lot while reading through my
first draft. (Leanne)
On APA Style and Paraphrasing:
When citing in the text a source that has six authors, do I list
them all out as I do in the references? It seems like that is a lot to
put in the paper. If you use a book that has a forward written by
another author, how do you cite it? (Adam)
I understand the benefit of using so many references especially
for a research paper. It was also difficult at times to paraphrase a
reference. They stated it so well that it was difficult to come up
with other wordings. (Ben)
I have learned that having many references will help solidify the
points that I am trying to make in my paper. When more than one
reference has a similar idea it makes the point stronger. (Adam)
On Connecting With Their Own Teaching:
At the beginning of this phase, to say I disliked revising and
editing is an understatement. Upon completion, the result of two
revised drafts was shocking, in a positive way--I saw the
immense improvement in my latest draft. The improvement
from the first draft stage to the next persuaded me to accept the
significance of revising and editing. I have been wondering on
how I can teach these skills to my students. They will benefit
tremendously if they master the skills. (Ben)
To assist teachers with their third draft, we first organized
peer editing and revision. Then, we did a mini-lesson on the
APA style. Teachers found that the three most difficult parts
of writing the third draft were (a) motivating themselves to
sit down and read through the draft to make revisions, (b)
verifying the reference pages, and (c) making sure that they
had everything for completing the draft. They learned that
having a peer read their paper and offer suggestions was very
helpful, and that it was OK that they were still gathering
information for the research part of the paper with the third
draft.
On the Benefits of Peer Revising and Editing:
Through the peer editing, I learned more about the use of
transitions. Dana pointed out that she knew what I was trying to
say, but there wasn't always a clear change in my words. She
was definitely right. As I read her notes and suggestions, I could
see that I abruptly ended and abruptly started without
transitioning. The transitions make the paper easy to read and
definitely help with the flow of the material. (Sandy)
What we learned from the reflection by the teachers and
our observation is that there was a major switch in their con-
cern. It was no longer about their topics; it became more
about the technicality and mechanics of the writing. The
focus was now on APA reference styles, transitional words,
and filling in the gaps. We felt this was a natural develop-
ment of understanding of writing; they were ready to move
on to the next phase--publishing.
Phase V: Finalizing and Sharing--Publishing
Publishing is the last phase in the writing process. Publishing
carries different meanings. In a K-12 writing project, it could
be a printout and posting on the classroom walls or a printed
paper brought home to parents. It could also be a digital pub-
lication where the writings by students are published on the
class website or a digital newsletter. As a capstone project,
teachers were required to have their final paper spiral bound
and handed in to their instructor for filing. However, the key
activity in this phase is sharing. Sharing completes the cycle
of process-based writing.
When reflecting on the most difficult part of the final
phase of writing, the teachers' reflections fall into two
themes. They are (a) finding it difficult to let go, because that
was the point of no return; they tended to double, triple, and
quadruple check that everything was in the proper order and
(b) realizing that the paper would never be perfect even with
more drafts and revisions. They learned that (a) a project of
this magnitude did not have to be overwhelming if you broke
it down to sections and (b) they began to see the benefits of
peer revising and editing, proving that writing was social and
took the whole village.
On Mechanical Issues:
The most difficult part of finalizing the report was again
carefully reading it all the way through checking for grammar
mistakes, consistentAPAformat, and content flow. For example,
I ended up changing the look of my section headlines because
they didn't match APA format. (Dana)
12 SAGE Open
I felt the most difficult part to finalizing my report involved
making sure everything was perfect. I found myself reading the
paper several times and checking for one thing at a time. First, I
would check to make sure all my sources were marked correctly;
the next time I was checking all the spaces. (Sara)
The most challenging part of finalizing my paper was making
sure that I had all the topics covered that I wanted to cover.
When I did my third draft, there were some pieces of information
that I hadn't included that I felt needed to be in the paper, but I
was unsure of where to put them. The peer revision and editing
was great. My partner read and discussed my paper and helped
me determine where I could put the extra information since she
had a very fresh eye. It was very helpful to have the class as a
learning community. I should follow this practice in my own
teaching. (Kendra)
On Understanding of the Writing Processes:
I have learned that writing a research paper to this extent is a
very time consuming task. I really enjoyed breaking this major
assignment up into several small assignments. It really helped
me to stay on task and manage my time better. (Holly)
I learned that a project this big doesn't have to be overwhelming.
I struggle with planning and tend to procrastinate. I liked the
way you broke down the process so I didn't have the opportunity
to procrastinate. It took the planning out of my hands which was
nice. (Angela)
On Connecting With Their Own Teaching:
The questions I have are more about myself as a learner and a
teacher rather than about the writing process or final project.
This experience has caused me to think a lot about the struggling
writers I teach each year. (Andrea)
I can really see the whole picture of process-based writing
approach now. I appreciate its functionality. I will try this writing
instruction approach with my fifth graders. I expect my students
to become better writers once they learn all the skills from the
process-based approach to writing. (Angela)
At the conclusion of the process-based writers' workshop,
teachers'perception of writing changed toward being positive,
both as a writer and teacher. Their reflections clearly indicated
that they had developed a much better understanding of
the writing process. They became much more tolerant of the
ambiguity in writing because they knew that even with pre-
planning and pre-writing, there would be uncertainty and only
the process would take care of the problems. One of the most
rewarding benefits is that teachers reflected on how they began
to understand the struggles their own students were having,
and they were more confident in providing the students help.
Discussion and Recommendations
Quantitative research in literature on process-based writing
approaches tends to report positive or negative findings in
a relatively linear manner, as many such research studies
were reported in the meta-analysis by Graham and Perin
(2007), and individual studies reported by Street and Stang
(2008, 2009). We have found that the challenges faced and
lessons learned by our practicing teachers are phase-
specific. Findings from this qualitative research show more
detailed and in-depth descriptions of what happened to
teachers in their learning and reflection in different phases
of the writing process. This rich nuance is different from
the quantitative results. The challenges and solutions are
unique for each phase, and best presented as phase-specific
findings.
Specifically, while teachers were faced with difficulties
throughout the process of writing, the foci of difficulties
changed with different phases. Therefore, different strategies
were necessary for instructors to provide assistance and
solve problems. For instance, a major obstacle at the begin-
ning of the writing project was that the majority of participat-
ing teachers (a) felt that they were not confident as writers,
let alone as effective writing teachers, (b) did not have a
soundunderstandingoftheprocess-basedwritingapproaches,
(c) had little or no personal experience in writing research
papers using the process-based writing model, and (d) real-
ized that their teacher education programs and professional
development targeted mainly the subject areas of reading
but not writing. An effective approach was to create a user-
friendly learning community where the participants could
express their concerns and be encouraged to get their feet
wet by embracing the process-based writing approach.
After accepting the process-based writing approach as a
new way of learning to write, the participating teachers
immediately ran into difficulty finding topics for their
research as required in Phase I: Topics and Questions--
Generate Ideas. The cause behind the difficulty was the
lack of knowledge on different educational topics. To some
extent, it had less to do with writing abilities than subject
and content knowledge. The solution varied with different
students in locating topics. Personal needs and concerns
tend to be good starting points. One such example is the
issue of literacy assessment that had bothered one student
for over a year. With some discussion in a small group of
classmates and some guidance from the instructor, she
developed this concern into a research topic with many pos-
sible aspects for investigation. Another effective way to
generate writing topics was to bring to class a textbook of
educational issues like the one written by James Noll
(2014), Taking Sides: Clashing Views on Educational
Issues. The book listed more than 23 critical educational
issues ranging from learning theories and standardized tests
to merit pay for teachers. The issues expanded teachers'
visions and were valuable in helping them choose one or
two to work on; moreover, the issues in the book activated
students' thinking processes and the students further devel-
oped their own topics. Another useful resource book used
was Issues and Trends in Literacy Education by Robinson
and McKenna (2011).
Li and Zhang 13
In contrast, the major obstacles faced during Phase II:
Sources and Syntheses--Building Knowledge involved find-
ing quality journal articles; the solution was to use a differ-
ent search database and various combinations of key words
and terms--more a technical issue than academic. The
second part of Phase II is on synthesizing the journal arti-
cles, a key component of the process-based writing in
building participant's knowledge. The strategy was to let
the teachers see the learning objectives of synthesizing
information mirroring the writing tasks of the Common
Core State Standards--writing from multiple sources.
Participants' reflections became positive and enthusiastic,
indicating a feeling of strong connection between the writ-
ing task at hand and their own teaching of writing in K-12
classrooms.
When the teachers were writing the draft in Phase III:
Putting It Together, the strategy was to model how the syn-
thesized information in I-Charts could be transferred into
an overall, detailed outline (Appendix C). A well-written
detailed outline performed as a roadmap, leading them from
Point A to Point B. However, incomplete I-charts for this
phase will inevitably jeopardize the next phase's assign-
ments and therefore affect the writing project negatively.
When revising and editing in Phase IV: Revising and
Editing: Peer Mentoring, teachers learned to trust their
learning community because they saw the value of the psy-
chological support and expertise support. Their reflections
provided strong evidence that when they benefited
from their peer revision and editing, they tended to con-
tribute more and take the peer revision and editing more
seriously.
When the teachers reached Phase V: Finalizing and
Sharing, their mindset was very different from the early
phases. They were more relaxed, more tolerant, and more
positive toward revisions. They understood that their paper
was not perfect and that there were areas for improvement--
a concept that might have disturbed some teachers if men-
tioned at the first phase. The participating teachers (a)
developed a deep understanding of the process-based writing
approach; (b) learned new skills of planning, drafting, revis-
ing, editing, and sharing; (c) were more confident as writers
themselves and as writing teachers for their students; and (d)
planned to use writing process-based approach in their own
teaching.
The process-based writing workshop approach success-
fully provided the teachers with first-hand experience that
writing was recursive and that revision and editing did not
just happen at the end of the first draft. In the second and
third phases, when teachers began to dig deep into their top-
ics, they found some dead ends and some new roads and
directions they did not see in the first two phases. Their
reflections clearly indicate their deepening understanding of
the ongoing revision process and they became comfortable
refocusing their research topics. Two of the teachers even
restarted with completely new topics and did so with a high
level of confidence and efficiency.
Research writing is underemphasized in both undergrad-
uate and graduate-level teacher education courses. Teachers
are underprepared to be writers and writing teachers, par-
ticularly in research writing and teaching. To ensure that
K-12 teachers are competent to teach future generations,
teacher education programs need to provide courses for
graduate students not only for learning how to teach writ-
ing but experiencing writing themselves (Kaiser, 2013;
Olthouse, 2012; Randles, 2012). They need to personally
experience the struggles and the lessons learned (Kittle,
2008). In these courses, we need to provide opportunities
where graduate students are actively involved in plan-
ning, drafting, revising, editing, and sharing as their own
students will be doing. Only then can we expect our grad-
uate students to be confident research writers themselves
and competent teachers of research writing for their stu-
dents. Their reflections in different phases indicate that
they saw many detailed connections between their learning
experiences in the course and the struggle their students
have in learning writing. The participating teachers
expressed strong desire and intent on how they would
apply the different strategies to their own teaching,
emphasizing the strategies of writing based on the infor-
mation from sources to meet the Common Core State
Standards for writing.
The following recommendations are for both the writing
instructors and students for academic research paper writing
using the process-based approach:
1. Every graduate-level education course should have
a writing component, either a position paper, syn-
thesis paper, or research paper, so that in-service
teachers can experience what their students are
experiencing.
2. The writing instruction needs to be both process and
genre based. Graduate-level education courses should
provide a conducive environment where the in-
service teachers are actively involved in the writing
process to inform, to persuade, and to convey experi-
ence as required by the Common Core State Standards
for K-12 students.
3. In-service teachers should experience planning, gath-
ering and synthesizing sources, drafting, revising,
editing, and publishing to have a deep understanding
of the writing process.
4. Teacher education professors should model each
phase of the writing process as teachers will do in
their K-12 classrooms so that practicing teachers will
learn to handle challenges related to different writing
phases.
5. Teacher education professors should encourage
in-service teachers to write for their school district
14 SAGE Open
professional development, for their professional
organization conferences, or for professional journals
with authentic audiences, purposes, and tasks instead
of writing for professors only.
Finally, there are two levels of caveats associated with
the recommendations. The first level is related to the nature
of the research methods and the number of participants for
the study. The findings and recommendations are based on
the interpretation of the qualitative data collected by the
authors of the study, and the study involved a relatively
small number of participants. The second level is that
despite the effectiveness of the process-based writing
approach described in this study, the sample in this study
represented a group of native English speakers with a U.S.
educational background. They are not representative of
their counterparts in other countries in terms of their pre-
paredness and performance. Therefore, cautions are called
for when considering the recommendations of the present
study.
Appendix A
A Sample Assignment and Reflection Sheet on
Writing a Capstone Question
Write a capstone question based on the following checklist:
1. I have one or two lead sentences introducing my topic.
2. I have the following four questions related to my topic:
a. definition/dimensions/principles
b. research support
c. challenges/needs/issues
d. solutions/strategies/applications
Reflect on your capstone question writing experience:
1. What is the most difficult part of writing the capstone
question and why?
2. What have you learned?
3. What questions do you still have?
Appendix B
A Sample Inquiry Chart.
Capstone question: Critical literacy--A critical component in literacy development
 What is critical literacy?
Why is critical literacy
important? What are the challenges? What are the solutions?
Article 1: p. 5 p. 6 p. 8 p. 8
Luke, L. (2012). Critical
literacy: Foundational
notes. Theory Into
Practice, 51, 4-11.
The term critical
literacy refers to use
of the technologies of
print and other media
of communication to
analyze, critique, and
transform the norms,
rule systems, and
practices governing
the social fields of
everyday life.
It is a key element of
education against
cultural exclusion and
marginalization with
a commitment to the
inclusion of working class,
cultural and linguistic
minorities, indigenous
learners, and others
marginalized on the basis
of gender, sexuality, or
other forms of difference.
Although Freirian
models provide a
pedagogical approach
and a political stance,
they lack specificity
on how teachers and
students can engage
with the complex
structures of texts,
both traditional and
multimodal.
Enable teachers and
students to focus on
how words, grammar,
and discourse choices
shape a version of
material, natural, and
sociopolitical worlds.
Enable a critical
engagement with the
question of where texts
are used, by whom, and
in whose interests.
