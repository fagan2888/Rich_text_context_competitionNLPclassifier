Introduction
Violence against women (VAW) is a significant global health
and social problem affecting all societies, but often it goes
unrecognized and unreported and in many countries, it is still
accepted as part of normal behavior (Gracia, 2004; World
Health Organization [WHO], 2005). Even though domestic
violence (DV) is now recognized as a major public health
concern, many health and social care professionals have been
slow to respond to address the issue. Evidence suggests that
health and social care professionals, who are equipped with
the relevant knowledge and skills, can play a key role in the
development of strategies and resources to combat DV
(Feder, Hutson, Ramsay, & Taket, 2006). However, research
illustrates that primary health care professionals are uncover-
ing abuse, such as DV, at much lower rates than that being
reflected by the prevalence estimates reported in the literature
(Kahan et al., 2000; Rabin et al., 2000). These low detection
rates have been attributed to inappropriate attitudes of pri-
mary health care professionals toward victims of violence
and abuse, together with a general lack of information and
training regarding DV (Peckover, 2003).
Literature Review
One of the most common and dangerous forms of violence
is DV, or domestic abuse. DV is a serious health problem
that is common to all societies and is linked to immediate
and longer term health, social, and economic consequences
(Goodwin, Hoven, Murison, & Hotopf, 2003; Krug,
Dahlberg, & Mercy, 2002). A lack of reliable statistical data
(Johnson, Haider, Ellis, Hay, & Lindow, 2003; Richardson et
al., 2002) and the variance in definition of this violence and
abuse make it difficult to estimate the true extent of the prob-
lem (Marchant, Davidson, Garcia, & Parsons, 2001). It is
often hidden, secret, and undisclosed as well as a primary
cause of gender-specific inequalities (Lazenbatt, Thompson-

A Cross-Cultural Comparative Study of
Undergraduate Health Care Professional
Students' Knowledge, Definitions, Education,
andTraining Experience of DomesticViolence
in Northern Ireland and Jordan

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the cross-cultural differences in the knowledge, definitions, and current training
and educational experiences of domestic violence (DV) among third-year undergraduate nursing,dental,and medical students
from two distinct universities in Northern Ireland and Jordan. A convenience sample of 774 undergraduate students was
recruited.Analysis was based on gender, culture, and educational speciality, as seen through the integrated lens of a social
ecological and feminist theory model.The results showed that a substantial percentage of all participants had never received
any education or training on DV in their undergraduate programs.The majority of participants had good knowledge about
DV, and half of the participants believed that DV is "common" in their respective countries. Significant gender and cultural
differences in the definition of DV were also revealed, with Northern Irish students and female students in both cultures
more likely to regard a range of behaviors as a form of DV.The research findings suggest several potential directions for
change, emphasizing the importance of establishing a systematic evidence-based multidisciplinary and interagency approach
to teaching and learning for student health care professionals on the topic of DV in their undergraduate programs.

Cree, & McMurry, 2005), which in turn can form significant
barriers to women receiving effective and equal health care
(WHO, 2000). DV may be a combination of physical, sex-
ual, emotional, or psychological abuse, resulting in various
health consequences ranging from physical injury to death.
Most consequences can lead to an increased use of medical
services and resources (Brokaw et al., 2002; Jewkes, 2002).
The ongoing underidentification and lack of understanding
about DV call for a closer look at undergraduate primary
health care professionals' knowledge, education, and train-
ing needs to deal with this serious public health issue.
Definitions andTerminology
Discussion of DV in general, and in specific contexts in
particular, calls for a thorough examination of the meaning,
attributed to the term violence (Winstok, 2007). There is
little consensus among researchers on exactly how to define
the terms violence and abuse. However, these terms are used
differently, by different disciplines, and also by lay persons
(Walker, 1999; Winstok, 2007).
The terms violence against women and gender-based vio-
lence are used in this article and both stem from the follow-
ing definition as provided by Article 1 of the UN Declaration
on the Elimination of Violence Against Women (DEVW,
1993), which defines the term violence against women as:
"Any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is
likely to result in physical, sexual or psychological
harm or suffering to women, including threats of such
acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty,
whether occurring in public or in private life."
There is a significant discrepancy among different cul-
tural definitions of what constitutes "DV" (Sokoloff &
Dupont, 2005); there appears to be no universally accepted
definition of DV as definitions used internationally and
nationally can vary substantially (Bradley, Smith, Long, &
O'Dowd, 2002; Verhoek-Oftedahl, Pearlman, & Coutu
Babcock, 2000; WHO, 2002). The collective understanding
of the behaviors that are associated with DV and the driving
forces underlying those behaviors reflect considerable varia-
tion across cultures (Malley-Morrison, 2004). Cross-cultural
investigations of DV are urged to carefully consider the lan-
guage used, as it may be inadequate to allow for a full explo-
ration of the relevant issues around DV (Fernández, 2006).
For the purpose of the study, "DV" is defined as:
"any violence against women which includes not just
physical, but verbal, psychological, emotional, eco-
nomic, and sexual patterns of behaviors, by their male
partners, whose aim is to control, threaten, isolate,
and/or exploit women."
Such a broad definition of DV incorporates the various
forms of oppression and violation that women experience
within a social-cultural context.
Integrated Social Ecological and FeministTheory
Two interlinking theoretical frameworks--the social
ecological theory and the feminist theory--are adopted in
this study to explain the approach of primary health care
professionals toward DV (see Figure 1). The social
ecological theory conceptualizes DV as a multifaceted
phenomenon grounded in interplay, between individual,
family, community, and societal factors, and is best visual-
ized as concentric circles (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Heise,
1998). Feminist theory, on the other hand, attributes
women abuse to the fundamental issues of unequally
distributed power and culturally based gender relational
patterns and patriarchal social patterns (Dobash & Dobash,
1979; Smith, 1990).
This approach is helpful in explaining the differences
between the modernized societies such in the United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland (NI), and more traditional
Arab and Jordan societies, in which these cultures have dif-
ferent social, cultural, legal, and political structures.
Recently, there has been an overall international trend
toward a more unified theoretical perspective, leaning heav-
ily on an integrated feminist understanding of the social
construction and dynamics of power relations (Muhlbauer,
2006). Feminist scholars believe that the patriarchal nature
Figure 1. Pathways to health care professionals' approach of
violence against women: using an integrated social ecological
model and feminist theory
Al-Ali and Lazenbatt 3
of society, through its emphasis on traditional gender role
socialization, plays an important role in the prevalence of
DV (Smith, 1990). In this sense, feminist theory does not
limit causes of DV to psychological and microsociological
factors but considers society's explicit and implicit rules
that legitimize violence under certain circumstances
(Abraham, 1995). Accordingly, men's power, domination,
and privileges over women inherent in any society are con-
sidered as a cause of domestic abuse. Hence, ending this
abuse would require a basic restructuring of the nature of
the power relations between men and women in society
(Dutton, 1998).
The importance of an integrated social ecological model
and feminist theory is that "it views behaviour as being
affected by, and affecting the social environment" (McLeroy,
Bibeau, Steckler, & Glanz, 1998). For primary health care
professionals, this view is important because it provides an
opportunity to design a range of health promotion strategies
targeting multiple levels within the social environment. The
holistic view of behavior, proposed by integrating a social
ecological model with feminist theory, permits primary
health care professionals to focus their attention to different
types of social influences and power dynamics, for which
they can develop appropriate interventions to modify health-
related behaviors (Little & Kantor, 2002).
Prevalence and Incidence
Worldwide, 1 in every 3 women suffers from DV, has been
beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise been abused in her
lifetime (Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002; WHO, 2002). In
the United Kingdom, the British Crime Survey (2004/2005)
indicated that 1 in 20 women have experienced one or more
incidents of partner abuse in the last year (Walby & Allen,
2004).InNI,1in5womenhaveexperiencedDV(Department
of Health, Social Services and Public Safety, 2005).
In Arab countries, many forms of VAW exist and are per-
petuated by the deep-rooted sociocultural factors. In Jordan,
although there are no studies on the rates of DV, the National
Institute of Forensic Medicine states that around 750 women
per year visit a forensic medical clinic in Amman, after suf-
fering DV (Amnesty International Jordan, 2004). However,
it is estimated that the actual number of victims could be 10
times higher. Worryingly, less than 10% of abused women
are identified by professionals within health care settings
(Council of Europe, 2002; Mirrlees-Black & Byron, 1999).
Primary Health Care Professional
Approaches to DV
The health care system is often the first place outside of
friends and family to which victims of domestic abuse turn,
thus placing health care professionals in a central role of
assistance and support (Ramsay, Richardson, Carter,
Davidson, & Feder, 2002; Wathen & MacMillan, 2003). Yet,
most primary health care professionals, including nurses,
dentists, and doctors, have traditionally received little pro-
fessional preparation on how to intervene and support
women living with DV (Bacchus, Mezey, & Bewley, 2003;
Häggblom, Hallberg, & Möller, 2005). These professionals
have also received limited education or training in this area
during their undergraduate training, or continuing profes-
sional development (Lazenbatt et al., 2005). Therefore, core
competencies in screening, recognizing, and treating the
short- and long-term manifestations of domestic abuse are
increasingly expected as the standard for health care profes-
sionals. However, to assess and intervene appropriately,
primary health care professionals must have current evi-
dence-based knowledge about DV, including communica-
tion skills, and attitudes necessary to ask enquiring questions;
the ability to offer appropriate information for intervention
and referral; and to make referrals to support networks and
community resources (Paluzzi & Houde-Quimby, 1996).
Although the evidence base is rapidly expanding on
protocols for the identification and management of women
suffering from DV, there is no published work on the identi-
fication of undergraduate university students' knowledge,
definitions, and education and training regarding domestic
abuse, particularly those from a primary health care back-
ground (Sugg, Thompson, Thompson, Maiuro, & Rivara,
1999; Thompson et al., 2000). There is also some evidence
to suggest that these undergraduate primary health care stu-
dents do not receive enough educational training about DV
(Naumann, Langford, Torres, Campbell, & Glass, 1999),
within the higher education curriculum, to allow them to
recognize and deal with domestic abuse in their future pro-
fessional practice. For these students to enter their profes-
sional practice feeling confident that they have an important
role in the supportive treatment for DV, they need to receive
comprehensive, integrated, multidisciplinary education dur-
ing their university undergraduate programs.
A need exists to build up the international evidence base
surrounding university primary health care professional stu-
dents' knowledge, education, and training experiences.
Investigating the training experiences of undergraduate
health care students from NI and Jordan will enable the
development of a culturally sensitive program. This will
allow the development of health professionals who will be
able to adopt a knowledgeable, evidence-based, and realistic
manner with regard to the management of women who have
experienced DV across countries that are diverse in terms of
culture, economics, and sociopolitical development.
Method
Design
A cross-sectional, comparative survey design is used to pro-
vide evidence of differences in terms of culture, gender, and
their educational speciality.
4 SAGE Open
Sample. A convenience sample consisting of 774 students
(NI = 322, Jordan = 452) with response rate of approxi-
mately 80% completed the questionnaire. In all, 63%
(n = 484) were nursing, 15% (n = 112) dental, and 23% (n =
178) medical students. The age of the participants ranged
from 18 to 45 years. In all, 64% (n = 493) of the participants
were female; and 87% were single, 8% married, and 4%
were divorced, widowed, or cohabiting at the time of the
study. With regard to the religious affiliation, 58% of the
participants were Muslims, and the remaining 38% were
Christians. The majority of the participants were Jordanian
(84%) for the Jordan sample and White (98%) for the NI
sample (Table 1). Both cultural groupings (NI and Jordan)
were surveyed in large classes; however, neither of these
groups is expected to be representative of the population at
large nor of students as a whole.
Instrument
A self-administered questionnaire "Students' Knowledge
and Attitudes of Violence and Abuse Scale" developed and
based on the following items was used to measure the differ-
ent variables of the study.
Demographic variables. This includes questions on the
sample demographic data, such as age, gender, religion, eth-
nicity, marital status, place of residence, university, and
school attended.
Students' definition of DV. This section included one ques-
tion utilizing a checklist, describing the various evidence-
based behaviors indicated as examples of DV. Participants
were asked to tick the behaviors that they felt indicated DV
or abuse.
Students' training and educational experience of DV. This
section consisted of five questions designed by the researcher
to measure the participants' previous education and training
with respect to DV against women. First, students were
asked four questions: "whether they had attended any
courses/seminars that had addressed DV within their
undergraduate program," "whether these were part of their
undergraduate program," "whether they had attended any
courses/seminars that had addressed DV outside the univer-
sity," and "whether they had listened and/or watched media
coverage program," using "yes/no" as answers. Second, the
students were asked to identify the extent of DV material
being taught in their current curricula, using a rating scale
format of "a great deal," "occasional mention," "very little if
any," "unsure," and "not at all."
Students' attitudes toward primary health care professionals
needs for education and training on DV. This section consisted
of a 4-item scale, designed to assess participants' attitudes
toward the need for education and training of primary health
care professionals in their undergraduate program. Responses
to these items were based on a 4-point Likert-type scale
(from 1 = strongly agree to 4 = strongly disagree).
Students' knowledge of DV. This section included two
parts: The first consisted of 12 questions developed by the
researcher, and based on the evidence-based literature, to
assess students' knowledge of DV. The questions were
focused on the impact of the DV on women's physical, psy-
chological, and reproductive health status; the common
cited risk factors; and the impact of DV on children's physi-
cal and emotional health. Responses to these questions were
based on true/false/don't know format. The second part
included one question to assess participants' knowledge of
the prevalence and the extent of DV in their home country,
using a rating format of "very common," "common," "rare,"
"very rare," and "don't know."
Translation and piloting of the questionnaire. The question-
naire was first constructed in English and used in its original
form for data collection in NI. After the English version was
developed, checked, and revised, it was translated into the
Arabic language and used for data collection in Jordan. The
questionnaire was pilot tested on undergraduate primary
health care professional students in NI and Jordan and, on
the basis of the pilot test, the wording of the questionnaire
was revised to enhance readability and content validity.

Data Collection
Data were obtained by a means of the self-administered
questionnaire as it allows complete respondent anonymity.
The researcher distributed the research materials, including
the questionnaires, consent forms, information sheets, and
other informational pamphlets to the student cohort. Upon
their arrival at class, the students were informed that partici-
pation in all parts of the study was voluntary and that they
could discontinue their participation at any time, without
penalty. The students were provided with information packs
within sealed envelopes that included contact numbers, self-
help groups, anonymous phone lines, and addresses of local
psychological support services or crisis centers for anyone
who may be exposed to DV.
Ethical Considerations
Prior to the onset of the proposed study, ethical approval was
sought from the Office of Research Ethics Committee of
Northern Ireland (NI-OREC) to pursue the current research
in NI. In Jordan, approval was sought by the researcher who
approached each faculty before conducting the study.
Participants in this study were treated according to the stan-
dard of ethics committee for conducting research.
Data Analysis
Data from each questionnaire was coded and entered into a
database. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS for
Windows 14.0 version software package, and included
descriptive, chi-square tests, t tests, and two-way ANOVA.
Results
Primary Health Care Students' Definitions of DV
Significant differences were found between the two cul-
tural groups when asked to define DV. Table 2 shows the
percentage of respondents for each culture and gender who
indicated that the illustrated behaviors indicated an exam-
ple of DV. For all behaviors listed, there were significant
differences between the two groups. Students in NI were
more likely than Jordanian students to label DV with all the
listed behaviors. For the most part, there were significant
differences between females and males in each culture. An
important difference between genders is that female stu-
dents in NI were significantly more likely than male stu-
dents to view verbal abuse, financial abuse, and controlling
behavior as a form of DV. In Jordan, female students were
significantly more likely than male students to view verbal
abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, intimidation, and
controlling behavior as a form of DV.
Educational andTraining Experience
Eighty-nine percent of all participants (n = 692) reported
that they had not attended lectures or seminars related to DV
at university. Only 11% of all participants (n = 82) stated
that they had attended lectures or seminars at university, and
of those respondents, only 7% (n = 55) indicated that these
lectures were part of their undergraduate program. Although,
85% of all participants (n = 658) never attended lectures or
seminars outside of the university, 88% of them had watched
or listened to media coverage program about the topic of
DV. There were significant differences observed among stu-
dents who had attended lectures outside of their university.
This reflects the fact that Jordanian students were more
likely than NI students to attend lectures or seminars outside
the university as illustrated in Table 3.
Significant differences were also revealed among stu-
dents who reported attending lectures at university as a part
of their undergraduate program, 2 = 15.05, df = 1, p = .001,
lectures attended by NI students (9%, n = 28/30) were more
likely to be part of their undergraduate program than by stu-
dents in Jordan (6%, n = 27/52). With regard to educational
specialties, the results showed that nursing students were
more likely than medical or dental students to attend lectures

at university, 2 = 24.8, df = 2, p < .05, and for these to be part
of their undergraduate program, 2 = 25.68, df = 4, p < .05.
Moreover, nursing students showed greater exposure to the
topic of DV through media programs rather than medical
students or dental students, 2 = 13.52, df = 2, p = .001. When
the students were asked about the extent of DV being taught
in their undergraduate education programs, 44% of all the
participants reported "very little if any," 40% "not at all,"
and 20% "occasional mentions," and only 3% of all partici-
pants reported "a great deal." Significant differences were
observed between the two samples, 2 = 15.47, df = 3, p =
.001, with NI students reporting "very little if any" more fre-
quently than students in Jordan as shown in Figure 2.
Primary health care professionals' attitudes to the need for
education and training on DV. Almost all participants showed
favorable attitudes toward the need of primary health care
professionals for education and training on DV within their
undergraduate programs (M = 7.12, SD = 2.07). Ninety-four
percent of the students strongly agreed, or agreed, with the
statement that "primary health care professionals need edu-
cation on the topic of DV," 85% strongly agreed that "DV
against women as a topic should be integrated into nursing,
dental, and medical undergraduate programs," and 94%
strongly agreed with the statements that "training on recog-
nition of DV should be included in undergraduate programs"
and "training on the management of DV should be included
in undergraduate programs" (see Table 4).
Among students in Jordan, two-way ANOVA revealed
only significant main effect for the educational specialty,
F(2, 444) = 5.05, p = .003. Post hoc tests revealed that nurs-
ing students differed significantly from medical students.
This indicated that medical students had more favorable atti-
tudes (M = 6.2) than nursing students (M = 6.95). All other
group comparisons did not reach statistical significance.
Primary health care students' knowledge of DV. With respect
to the knowledge that students had on the topic of DV, on
average, all students demonstrated a good knowledge (M =
8.73, SD = 2.14). The results showed that 75% had answered
10 out of 12 questions correctly, and half of the participants
(50%) answered at least 9 questions correctly. More specifi-
cally, 73% of all participants believed that DV at home
causes more physical injury to women than violence by
strangers, with 82% believing that women evaluate emo-
tional abuse as worse than physical abuse. With regard to the
question "`when is DV against women likely to stop," 60%
of all participants believed that DV is unlikely to stop during
pregnancy and postnatally, and 53% believed that it is
unlikely to stop even after the woman leaves her abusive
husband. Furthermore, 93% and 83% of all participants
believed that alcohol and substance abuse, and long-term
unemployment, respectively, were used as an excuse for DV.
Moreover, 87% of all participants believed that psychologi-
cal stress was often used as an excuse for DV.
Moreover, there were significant differences revealed
between genders in NI (t = -2.13, df = 320, p = .033) and in
Jordan (t = -4.37, df = 450, p < .05). The results showed that
female students in both cultures had greater knowledge of
the topic of DV than their male counterparts (see Table 5).
However, there were no significant differences in the
knowledge between genders across cultures. In relation to
educational specialty, the only significant differences were

found among dental students (t = -2.52, df = 110, p = .013).
Dental students in Jordan had significantly higher scores in
knowledge than dental students in NI.
The two-way ANOVA test revealed a significant main
effect of speciality, F(2, 314) = 3.44, p = .03, of students'
knowledge among the NI cohort. As the post hoc tests
revealed, nursing students (M = 8.18) had higher scores in
knowledge than dental students (M = 7.68).
Among students in Jordan, the results revealed significant
main effects of gender, F(1, 444) = 17.43, p < .05, and edu-
cational speciality, F(2, 444) = 3.06, p = .04, on students'
knowledge. The results indicate that female students (M =
8.67) had higher scores in knowledge than male students (M
= 7.88). In relation to educational specialty, post hoc tests
revealed that nursing students (M = 8.5) differed signifi-
cantly from medical students (M = 8.0), demonstrating that
medical students had lower scores in knowledge than nurs-
ing students.
Primary health care students' knowledge of prevalence of DV.
Of all participants, 49% (n = 379) reported that the preva-
lence of DV in their respective countries is "common," 25%
"very common," 12% "rare," and only 6% stated "don't
know" as illustrated in Table 6. Significant differences were
observed between the two samples, 2 = 34, df = 5, p < .05,
with respect to gender, 2 = 15, df = 5, p = .01, and with
respect to educational speciality, 2 = 42, df = 10, p < .05.
These findings indicate that Jordanian students tend to
acknowledge the prevalence of DV in their country as "com-
mon" more often than those in the NI sample. In addition,
there was a significant difference between gender in Jordan,
2 = 21.63, df = 5, p = .001, with female students more likely
than male students to report the prevalence as "common."
Moreover, medical students (38%) in both cultures were
more likely than nursing students (19%) to report the preva-
lence as "very common"; however, dental students (31%)
were less likely than medical students to report "very
common."
Discussion
This study explained the undergraduate health care profes-
sionals' approaches to DV and abuse through the lens of the
social ecological model and feminist theory. In this study,
students' definitions of DV, their knowledge about the sever-
ity, prevalence of DV, and their training and educational
experiences were tested.
From the social ecological perspective of health care pro-
fessionals' approach to DV, numerous studies have shown
that the disposition of health care professionals involved in
assessment and identification of abused women is largely
influenced by their definition of the problem (Gerbert et al.,
2002; Sugg et al., 1999). Moreover, the cultural differences
in the definition of DV revealed by this study are consistent
with the results of previous studies which have shown that

cultural orientation and values shape the definition of DV
(Kim & Motsei, 2002; Torres, 1991). Torres (1991) con-
cluded that Mexican women's definitions of DV were
strongly shaped by Hispanic cultural beliefs about the roles
of men and women in their society. Likewise, the female and
male students in Jordan defined DV to reflect their patriar-
chal beliefs about women and VAW.
Although this study shows that the student health care
professionals' definition of DV reflected their considerable
awareness of the problem and of various patterns of VAW,
their responses also included indications that they are not
always willing to consider acts of violence as DV. Overall,
the vast majority of the participants in NI and Jordan defined
many of the behaviors as DV; however, as physical and sex-
ual violence were likely to be viewed as DV, verbal abuse,
psychological/emotional, financial abuse, intimidation, and
controlling behaviors were less likely to be perceived as DV
particularly by male participants.
In this study, female students in both cultures had clearer
and broader definitions of DV and were more likely than
male students to include a range of behavior as a form of DV.
Consistent with the findings of this study, a study among
male and female nurses (Kim & Motsei, 2002) found that,
unlike the males, females frequently described DV in terms
of emotional or psychological abuse, and economic abuse
was also only raised by women.
Based on the findings, it is clear that the study sample had
a general lack of educational exposure to the issue of VAW in
their undergraduate educational programs, which is highly
consistent with the results presented in the research literature
(Häggblom et al., 2005; Woodtli, 2001). Interestingly, the
results of this study revealed that almost all respondents had
favorable attitudes toward the need for health care profes-
sionals to receive education and training on DV. Violence-
related curriculum content and health care professionals'
attitudes about DV and the related learning experiences of
the students had been the subject of several recent research
studies (Ross, Hoff, & Bunn, 2000, Woodtli & Breslin,
2002). These studies are primarily based on the premise that
one essential approach to facilitate appropriate care to
women is through professional educational programs that
prepare health care professionals who are sensitive,
knowledgeable, and skilled in the care of women and their
families who have experienced violence. The differences
between specialities revealed in this study were consistent
with the results of other studies conducted among health care
professional's students and medical staff (Majumdar, 2004;
Morgan, 2003).
At the ecological analysis level of approaching DV in
clinical care settings, lack of knowledge among health care
professionals was reported as a reason for not acting upon
DV cases (Woodtli, 2000). The findings of this study reveal
significant levels of awareness among all health care
students in their knowledge about the problem of DV.
Interestingly, this study illustrates that students in Jordan
overall had more exposure to the topic of DV outside uni-
versity, whereas students in NI had more formal education
within the university, albeit limited. In the United Kingdom,
Williamson (2000) refers to the increase in guidelines
in Britain for health professionals to deal with DV, yet
questions about how such guidelines can be implemented
without staff training designed to address DV and the role of
health care professionals. To provide treatment and support
to victims of DV, it is crucial to assure these future health
care professionals with access to the knowledge, training,
and skills appropriate to dealing with cases of DV and
abuse. Nurses, dentists, and doctors must develop skills in
identifying abuse cases and an understanding of family vio-
lence dynamics.
In this study, findings indicate that very few of all
respondents think DV is uncommon; in fact, it is somewhat
surprising to find that health care professionals' students
are as aware of the prevalence of DV as they are, which is
inconsistent with other research that has shown that health
care professionals often underestimate the rate of DV in
their populations (Lazenbatt et al., 2005; Rabin et al.,
2000).
Conclusion
Student health care professionals are ideally placed to rec-
ognize and detect ongoing DV, and to offer care, support,
and information to the woman involved. The greatest limi-
tation inherent in this study is the inclusion of primarily

third-year undergraduate health care professionals' stu-
dents. This aspect of the study is likely to result in a limited
generalizability to the general population and to under-
graduate students in particular. Therefore, it will be neces-
sary for future studies to include more diversity relative to
age, ethnicity, educational level, religious background, and
population setting.
This study suggests that student health care professionals
need to learn a more comprehensive global operational defi-
nition of DV and abuse (e.g., physical violence, sexual
assault, emotional/psychological violence, and economic
abuse). It appears that a more uniform and universal defini-
tion of DV must be derived to allow for overall comparison
between studies and to allow multiprofessionals to view DV
from the same perspective. This study supports the need for
student undergraduate health professionals to receive sig-
nificant training and education on VAW in their university
training and educational program. In addition, regular con-
tinual professional development updates should be available
for all health care professionals. By this, the present research
study recommends that student health care professionals
should be empowered with a joined up approach that
includes an understanding of evidence-based research in the
area, clear knowledge of support agencies, and interagency
networks and refuges to allow them to give ongoing and
appropriate information that will in itself empower and sup-
port women to make their own informed choices.
