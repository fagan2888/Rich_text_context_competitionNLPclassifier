Abstract: As evidenced by research in evolutionary psychology, humans have evolved
sophisticated psychological mechanisms tailored to solve enduring adaptive problems of
social life. Many of these social problems are political in nature and relate to the
distribution of costs and benefits within and between groups. In that sense, evolutionary
psychology suggests that humans are, by nature, political animals. By implication, a
straightforward application of evolutionary psychology to the study of public opinion
seems to entail that modern individuals find politics intrinsically interesting. Yet, as
documented by more than fifty years of research in political science, people lack
knowledge of basic features of the political process and the ability to form consistent
political attitudes. By reviewing and integrating research in evolutionary psychology and
public opinion, we describe (1) why modern mass politics often fail to activate evolved
mechanisms and (2) the conditions in which these mechanisms are in fact triggered.

Introduction
Politics is not only a feature of all known human societies, but of all social primates
(Brown, 1991; de Waal, 1996). Evidence indicates that political conflict predates the
emergence of Homo sapiens, and has most likely been a persistent characteristic of our
evolutionary lineage for millions of years (Boehm, 2000; Wrangham and Peterson, 1996).
The political challenges of small-scale social interaction posed enduring problems for our
hunter-gatherer ancestors and, most likely, selected for sophisticated psychological
mechanisms designed to navigate them (Petersen, 2011). In this sense, Aristotle's famous
dictum, "man is, by nature, a political animal," has been vindicated (Hatemi and
McDermott, 2011).

A biologically informed approach is increasingly guiding how psychologists (Haidt,
2012; Sidanius and Kurzban, 2003) and political scientists (Alford and Hibbing, 2004;
Hatemi and McDermott, 2011; Petersen, 2012; Fowler and Schreiber, 2008) study modern
political attitudes and behaviors. An underlying argument is that the existence of evolved
political cognition makes opinion formation on modern political issues easy and effortless.
At the same time, however, a long line of research in political science has concluded that
most people find politics complicated and difficult to understand. During the 2008 US
presidential election, for example, 69 percent of the American electorate agreed that
"sometimes, politics and government seem so complicated that a person like me can't really
understand what's going on" (ANES 2008). It seems that the political animal is, by self-
profession, politically ignorant.
In this article, we address this puzzle (i.e., why the human political animal is
politically ignorant). By reviewing and integrating insights from evolutionary psychology
and political science, we describe (1) why modern mass politics often fail to activate
evolved mechanisms for social and political decision-making and (2) the conditions in
which these mechanisms are in fact triggered.
A Public of Political Animals
As group-living animals, ancestral humans' fitness crucially hinged on their ability
to navigate social life. Converging lines of evidence from archaeology (e.g., Alperson-Afil
et al., 2009), studies of non-human primates (e.g., Wrangham and Peterson 1996; de Waal,
1996), and anthropology (Brown, 1991) suggest that problems relating to the formation of
coalitions, the facilitation of cooperation and gains-in-trade within and between groups, the
punishment of exploiters, negotiation of status and hierarchical differences have all
constituted important adaptive problems with deep roots in our evolutionary history (for an
overview, see Buss, 2005).
From a problem-solving perspective, social life is constituted by a multitude of
separate problems each posing its own sets of challenges and requiring its own set of
solutions. Choosing a competent leader in times of war requires, for example, different
cognitive processes than choosing a trustworthy cooperative partner. As demonstrated in
the cognitive sciences, distinct problems are most adaptively solved by distinct decision-
rules that take the particularities of the specific problem into account (Tooby and
Cosmides, 1992; Gigerenzer et al., 1999). Given that processes of natural selection drive
biological design towards greater optimization, this suggests that the evolutionarily
recurrent problems of social life have selected for a multitude of narrow decision-rules
tailored to particular classes of social problems.
Some of the social problems that humans evolved to process and solve are related to
political conflicts. According to the most widely adopted scholarly definition, politics is an
overarching term for the set of activities whereby individuals and coalitions seek to
influence the recognized allocation of scarce resources within societies (Easton, 1953). On
this definition, political conflicts are of two kinds. First, political conflicts are conflicts over
the power to make political decisions--that is, the power to influence who gets what
without having to resort to physical aggression. Although political power can be exercised
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -804-
under implicit threats of aggression, political power in its purest form is when an individual
gets other people to do something they would not otherwise do because they find it to be in
their own interest to act in accordance with that individual's interests. When people have to
resort to physical aggression, it signifies the breakdown of political power. Conflicts over
political power, then, are intrinsically linked to status competitions. Second, political
conflicts are conflicts over the content of political decisions and, hence, involve attempts to
tweak allocations into greater alignment with ones preferences. Such conflicts are based on
assessments of how different allocation schemes influence the welfare of the self and
significant others.
Given this understanding of politics, evidence from evolutionary psychology
suggests that humans are political animals, ready to engage and capable of engaging in
conflicts that are political. Research has demonstrated that humans universally compete
(both as individuals and through the formation of coalitions) for status positions (Sidanius
and Pratt, 2001), that these positions as leaders are not merely equated with dominance (cf.
Henrich and Gil-White, 2001), that adaptations exist for following leaders that are best
suited for tackling the problems confronting the group (Little et al., 2007, 2012; Spisak et
al., 2012), and that the discretion of leaders are recognized in the sense that individuals can
view decisions from legitimate leaders as justified even if they entail negative outcomes for
the self (Hibbing and Alford, 2004). Furthermore, evolutionary psychologists have
uncovered a suit of cognitive mechanisms designed to evaluate allocations of costs and
benefits within and between groups from the perspective of the self. Extensive research has
shown that humans have an intuitive sense of what allocations of resources are fair
(Cosmides and Tooby, 2005), who deserves to reap benefits from collective enterprises
(Price et al., 2002), who constitutes the ingroup that is relevant to consider as targets of
help (Yamagishi and Mifune, 2004), what should be done with those taking more than their
share (Petersen, Sell et al., 2012) and so forth. Whereas the first set of findings suggests
that humans have evolved cognitive mechanisms for seeking political power and for
adaptively following the politically powerful, this second set of findings reveals an evolved
basis for political judgments or attitudes, i.e., mechanisms for judging a particular
allocation as good or bad from the perspective of the self.
As is increasingly argued among both evolutionary psychologists and political
scientists (Alford and Hibbing, 2004; Haidt, 2012; Sidanius and Kurzban, 2003; Hatemi
and McDermott, 2011; Petersen, 2012; Fowler and Schreiber, 2008), the existence of these
mechanisms are of key importance in understanding how individuals form attitudes on
modern political issues. A large range of prominent modern political issues have direct
parallels to ancestral social life. At their core, modern issues such as social welfare, race
relations, and criminal justice reflect evolutionarily recurrent problems such as whether to
share with needy individuals, how to treat outgroups, and how to deter and reconcile with
exploiters.
Recent research in fact suggests that the exact same mechanisms used to make
decisions about these broader social problems are active during political attitude formation
on modern issues. Table 1 provides an overview of this research; it describes how different
modern political issues (the first column) have been argued to match the input conditions
for mechanisms designed to process specific adaptive problems (the second column) as
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -805-
well as illustrative key findings from this research (the third column) (for a more thorough
review, see Petersen, 2011). Supporting the view of humans as political animals, the
findings summarized in Table 1 suggest that the mechanisms making up our evolved social
cognition is applicable to at least a central set of mass political issues. As can also be seen,
most issues are processed by a number of cognitive mechanisms relating to a range of
adaptive problems. In this sense, modern individuals seemingly have a tool box available
with a range of cognitive tools for facilitating the formation of political attitudes and the
execution of political decisions.
The Political Animal as Politically Ignorant
From the above discussion, an immediate prediction springs to mind: If humans are
indeed political animals, they should think of modern politics as engaging and easy.
Surprisingly, however, research suggests that this is not the case. Hence, a core topic for
political science researchers has been the political interest, knowledge and sophistication of
the public: Do people know much about politics? Do they care about politics? Can they
make up their minds on political substance? As we will outline in more detail below, the
short answer to these questions is, "no". As emphasized by Kinder (1998a, p. 784) most
individuals are "awash in ignorance" of politics.
To act politically in modern democratic society, one needs to know the basic
operations of the political system, the key institutions and actors as wells as the content of
policies (Delli Carpini and Keeter, 1996). Yet, fifty years of research in political science
demonstrates that most people only have very limited knowledge about specific policies
and are uninformed about political institutions and political actors such as parties and
elected officials (e.g., Berelson, 1952; Campbell et al., 1960; Delli Carpini and Keeter,
1996; Downs, 1957; Kinder, 1998b, p. 169). In the 1950's, for example, two out of three
citizens only held moderate or no interest in politics (Berelson et al., 1954, p. 306). Over
the years, not much has changed: In the fall of 1992 only 59 percent Americans knew that
the Democrats held the majority of the seats in the House of Representatives despite the
fact that the Democratic Party had held the control of the House for more than 40 years
(Kinder, 1998b, p. 169). Likewise, in 1995 twice as many Americans incorrectly believed
that the federal government spend more money on foreign aid than on Medicare (Kinder,
1998b, 169). While humans seem to have an evolved sense of power and leadership, many
simply do not pick up the relevant facts necessary for understanding who has political
power or for striving for that power themselves in the context of modern democratic
politics. As Ferejohn (1990, p. 3) sums up: "Nothing strikes the student of public opinion
and democracy more forcefully than the paucity of information most people possess about
politics."

Whether or not people have their facts straight, they could hold passionate (but
uninformed) opinions about modern political issues. Here, the evidence is more mixed. In
general, most people find it difficult to make political decisions. They often only hold weak
or no preferences in relation to policy (Popkin, 1991) and, if they do hold preferences, these
are often internally inconsistent (Converse, 1964; Zaller, 1992). At the same time, however,
it is important to differentiate between different types of issues. While research on this is
limited, political scientists have argued that certain issues are "easier" to form opinions
about and vote on the basis of than others (Carmines and Stimson, 1980). In a European
context, Slothuus (2005) compared eight different issues and showed that whereas
questions about attitudes on immigration, social welfare and criminal justice elicit very few
"don't know" responses, questions about economic policies and the European Union elicit
a much higher rate. If we compare these observations to the findings in Table 1, this clearly
suggests that the more a modern political issue carries recognizable similarities to basic
adaptive problems, the easier it is for people to form opinions (see also Haidt, 2012). Some
issues such as macro-economic policies and intergovernmental regulation emerge
exclusively in the context of modern society and humans have few if any evolved cognitive
mechanisms for processing such issues. Importantly, however, this conclusion needs to be
qualified. Whereas people only infrequently report that they don't have an opinion on
issues such as social welfare, abortion, and criminal justice, researchers still often observe
that the opinions reported are highly inconsistent and temporally unstable (for social
welfare, see Zaller and Feldman, 1992; for criminal justice, see Cullen et al., 2000; for
abortion, see Alvarez and Brehm, 2002). This is important because it implies that
individuals are ambivalent and have contradictory considerations even on "hot button"
political issues that tap into evolved cognitive mechanisms.
Mismatches between Ancestral Social Life and Modern Politics
How can the conclusion that humans evolved as political animals be reconciled with
these observations of political ignorance? According to the mismatch hypothesis, many
seemingly irrational behaviors emerge from differences between modern and ancestral
environments that cause cognitive mechanisms to misfire (Hagen and Hammerstein, 2006).
This, we argue, is exactly the case in relation to mass politics. While many mass political
issues resemble evolutionarily recurrent adaptive problems, there are at the same time a
range of differences between now and then that causes mismatches between the available
cognitive mechanisms and the cognitive demands involved in forming political attitudes
(Petersen, 2011).
Humans evolved as hunters and gatherers in small-scale groups of 25 to 200
individuals, without any codified institutions (Kelly, 1995; Dunbar, 1998). Consequently,
humans' evolved social cognition is designed to be operative within small-scale social
environments and, accordingly, to produce outputs on the basis of cues and information
residing in such environments. Modern states, in contrast, comprise millions of people, are
complex webs of formal, codified institutions, and make use of advanced technology. This
creates two types of mismatches relevant to political attitude formation:
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -808-
The first type relates to mismatches between the problems of modern politics and
ancestral social living, which means that for many modern political issues, there are no
relevant cognitive mechanisms for generating interest and producing clear inferences. For
example, complicated formalized procedural rules for decision-making in parliament are
cultural artefacts that (at least, to the outsider) might not fit the input conditions of any
evolved cognitive mechanism. Similarly, the existence of macro-economic regulation is
closely tied to the emergence of mass society and will seem "non-intuitive" to the evolved
small-scale oriented mind. Such mismatches could explain both the general lack of
knowledge about modern democratic institutions and the difficulties in forming opinions on
a range of "hard" political issues.
The second type of mismatch, in contrast, is about contextual differences between
the way similar political problems are posed ancestrally and today. This type of mismatch,
we argue, causes modern people to have difficulties in forming opinions even on those
issues that otherwise fit evolved cognitive mechanisms (cf. the last paragraph of the
preceding section). Outlining this type of mismatch requires the establishment of a number
of key points.
First, it is important to acknowledge that, because many social problems are
exceptionally complex, their solution requires facultative decision rules. In cooperation
problems, for example, simulation studies demonstrate that unilateral strategies such as
"always cooperate" and "always defect" are inferior to contingent strategies such as "tit-
for-tat" that adjust decisions to the decisions of the partner (e.g., Axelrod, 1984). Rather
than global preferences such as "always cooperate", "always shun outgroups", "always
punish", evolution has selected for psychological mechanisms that produce different
preferences depending on the circumstances facing the individual (Tooby and Cosmides,
1992). The mind of the political animal, then, is a collection of mechanisms designed to
navigate social life by extracting myriads of cues and information about ecological and
social contingencies.
Second, in the small-scale world of our ancestors, the relevant cues for social
decision-making would be cues residing in face-to-face interaction. These include intimate
knowledge about targets of decisions (Lieberman and Linke, 2007), the presence of
bystanders (Haley and Fessler, 2005), facial expressions (Scharlemann et al., 2001),
physical characteristics of self and other (Sell et al., 2009; Jensen and Petersen, 2011), and
directions of eye gaze (Kurzban, 2001). That is, to operate and produce clear inferences,
human social cognition requires the availability of intimate social cues.
Third, while the availability of general information is abundant in modern society,
intimate social information about co-citizens of this kind is lacking. In modern society,
each citizen only knows and ever meets a tiny fraction of his or her co-citizens and the far
largest part is constituted by anonymous strangers. This has often been noted by political
scientists ­ as reflected in quotes such as "our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach
of time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe" (Lippmann, 1922, p. 49)
and "citizens in large societies are dependent on unseen and usually unknown others for
most of their information about the larger world in which they live" (Zaller, 1992, p. 6).
This lack of vivid social cues is attenuated because the vastness of modern political systems
imposes a certain structure on modern political debates. While social decisions in small-
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -809-
scale environments are often targeted at specific others, modern politics is about
establishing general rules applying across specific cases (Stone, 1988). Ultimately, the
problems confronting people are not whether a specific criminal should be punished,
whether a specific welfare recipient should be helped, or whether a specific immigrant
should be allowed entry. Rather, the key issues are how to treat all criminals, all welfare
recipients, and all immigrants. People, in essence, are required to think and respond in
terms of whole categories of faceless individuals, whereas social cognition is designed to
extract massive information about the specific others directly in front of us.
In tandem, these observations imply that while individuals enter mass politics with
sophisticated evolved mechanisms for political cognition, the lack of cues that fit the input
conditions of the underlying mechanisms will necessarily impede their operations. In line
with this, research has demonstrated how social cognition is inhibited when deprived of
intimate social cues. For example, studies using fMRI have shown how activity in brain
regions related to emotional processing are down-regulated when vivid personal cues are
unavailable (e.g., de Quervain et al., 2004; Sanfey et al., 2003) and, outside the laboratory,
research on group efficiency has shown that social and emotional coordination in groups is
inhibited when groups do not interact face-to-face (Baltes et al., 2002). In order for social
cognition to produce clear political inferences even on issues that resemble ancestral social
problems, modern individuals, in other words, need to compensate for a lack of direct,
intimate, and vivid social cues in mass politics.
When and How Mass Politics Engage the Political Animal
We now review a selection of external inputs and internal processes facilitating
people's use of evolved cognitive mechanisms when reasoning about mass political issues.
This discussion is not meant as an exhaustive review of all possible strategies but a case by
case illustration of how people may acquire vivid social cues or compensate for the lack
thereof through 1) externally provided media stories and 2) internal psychological
processes allowing them to mentally simulate the absent cues.
The mass media is an obvious external source of vivid social cues (e.g., Iyengar and
Kinder, 1987), which can facilitate the use of evolved cognitive mechanisms during
political attitude formation. Mass media may, for example, supply relevant cues by
covering political issues using particularly vivid story formats. Of special relevance is the
often used media strategy of illustrating (i.e., framing) general and technical political issues
using specific persons and their personal histories. Here, the audience is directly provided
with relevant intimate, social cues that resemble the kinds of cues social cognition evolved
to process and these cues come to frame the more general issue. A series of studies have
investigated the psychological effects of such episodic framing and have provided evidence
that episodic frames allow individuals to utilize more basic moral and emotional decision-
making mechanisms when forming opinions on the relevant issues (Aarøe, 2011; Gross,
2008). When issues are framed in terms of general statistical and abstract information, in
contrast, these emotional reactions are impeded.
Not just the format of media stories but also their specific content can facilitate
people's utilization of evolved cognitive mechanisms by providing cues that fit the input
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -810-
conditions of specific issue-relevant mechanisms. Social welfare issues, for example,
resemble more general social problems related to sharing. In situations involving sharing,
elaborate experiments have shown that individuals possess specialized psychological
mechanisms designed to identify "cheaters" (Cosmides and Tooby, 2005) and that these
mechanisms discriminate between cheaters and non-cheaters on the basis of their displayed
efforts to accrue and exchange resources (Cosmides and Tooby, 2005; Cosmides, Barrett,
and Tooby, 2010; Petersen, 2012). A series of studies have shown how these mechanisms
designed for general cheater-detection can come to structure modern social welfare
attitudes when individuals are directly provided with cues to the effort of social welfare
recipients in, for example, media stories. Such cues influence opinions such that people
become less supportive of welfare in the face of lazy welfare recipients (Slothuus, 2007),
make individuals intuitively represent modern welfare as small-scale sharing situations
(Petersen, 2012), activate emotions of anger and compassion that come to guide welfare
opinions (Petersen, Sznycer et al., 2012) and help individuals lacking political knowledge
and sophistication, effortlessly make up their minds on the otherwise complicated issue of
social welfare (Petersen et al., 2011).
Another illustration of how the mass media supply vivid cues that tap into evolved
social cognition is a recent study of how loss aversion and ingroup bias influence the
persuasiveness of political arguments (Arceneaux, 2012). Across disparate decision-making
situations and cultures, individuals tend to give priority to avoid losses rather than pursuing
gains and display deep suspicion of outsiders while privileging their ingroup members
(Arceneaux, 2012), biases which plausibly reflect adaptive error-management (Haselton
and Buss, 2003). Arceneaux (2012) demonstrated that political arguments that directly
target and activate these biases are more persuasive and prompt individuals to change their
opinions on important issues such as health regulation and government spending. The
persuasiveness of such arguments holds up even when challenged by more rationalistic
(and less-bias congruent) arguments.
While the mass media may constitute one important external source of the kind of
vivid social cues to which our evolved political cognition responds, cognitive scientists also
increasingly emphasize internal psychological processes as central compensatory strategies
which individuals use when making decisions in sparse information contexts. An important
aspect of these processes is often referred to as decoupled cognition (e.g., Cosmides and
Tooby, 2000; Boyer, 2001). As emphasized by Buss (2005, p. 62) decoupled cognition
permits offline cognition where individuals rely on intense mental simulations and imagery
in interaction with domain specific mechanisms to imagine solutions to social problems,
problems of tool use or other recurrent problems. This suggests that when vivid social cues
are absent, people can utilize relevant evolved mechanisms by engaging in decoupled
cognition to imagine what they cannot see, and feed these internally generated
representations and beliefs into mechanisms for small-scale political decision-making
(Petersen and Aarøe, 2012). In line with this, differences in the personality trait, Openness
to Experience, which is related to abilities to mentally simulate, predict a variety of
measures of political engagement such that open people are more likely to be politically
engaged (Gerber et al., 2011; Mondak and Halperin, 2008; Mondak et al., 2010). Likewise,
measuring physiological responding based on electrodermal activity (EDA), a recent study
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -811-
demonstrated that individuals with high general EDA responsiveness to external stimuli
(i.e., people who extract more affective meaning from their environment) are also more
likely to be politically involved (and, in fact, that EDA responsiveness seems in particular
to compensate for otherwise low levels of involvement among individuals with little
education) (Gruszczynski et al., 2012). Other strands of research have focused on
stereotypes as a particular kind of decoupled cognition and shown how stereotypes about
criminals that fit the input conditions of evolved psychological mechanisms for counter-
exploitation cause individuals to have attitudes about criminal justice that are internally
consistent (Petersen, 2009) and infused with affect (Petersen, 2010). Finally, focusing on
the case of social welfare, a series of studies have directly provided evidence that
individual differences in imaginative capacity affect individuals' use of evolved cognitive
mechanisms to form political attitudes. Specifically, people high in imagination more easily
form social welfare attitudes because they hold more vivid stereotypes of welfare recipients
that subsequently allow for a stronger activation of cheater-detection mechanisms during
attitude formation (Petersen and Aarøe, 2012).
Within the political science literature, factual political knowledge (e.g., Zaller,
1992) has in particular been emphasized as a source of internal information that people can
utilize during opinion formation. While most people only have limited political knowledge,
there are substantial individual differences in the level of knowledge that people have
available and some individuals have quite high levels of political knowledge (Delli Carpini
and Keeter, 1996). Research has consistently shown that political knowledge enables
individuals' to make more internally consistent political choices and to do so with greater
ease (e.g., Barker, 2005; Sniderman et al., 1991). The classical interpretation of this is that
knowledge about basic political facts enables individuals to reason more deeply and
thoroughly about politics. Yet, recent studies suggest that political knowledge rather
provides another kind of path through which individuals can utilize evolved mechanisms
for small-scale political decisions in the context of mass politics (Schreiber, 2007). For
example, when thinking about politics, people with high political knowledge have been
shown to have greater activation in the brain's default state network ­ a neutral circuitry
that has specifically been linked to social cognition (Fowler and Schreiber, 2008). Rather
than just providing the basis for deep reflection, factual political knowledge also seems to
provide a reservoir of information that can serve as triggers for social intuitions and help
individuals see the policy implications of those intuitions.
Conclusion
Humans are political animals in the sense that they, during normal development,
build a suit of sophisticated psychological mechanisms designed to, first, strategically seek
and recognize political power and, second, form and evaluate decisions about the
allocations of costs and benefits within and between groups. The problems these
mechanisms evolved to navigate carry similarities to modern political issues such as
democratic elections, social welfare, criminal justice, race relations and redistribution and,
hence, seem to be readily utilizable for political choice on modern issues. Yet, as we have
reviewed here, political science has produced ample evidence that people find it inherently
Is the political animal politically ignorant?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -812-
difficult to form political opinions and they lack substantive political knowledge. In
traditional political science, researchers have generally attributed this state of affairs to a
lack of political sophistication or even plain empty-headedness among the public (e.g.
Converse, 1964; Zaller, 1992). In contrast, we have argued that an explanation focusing on
the mismatches between ancestral social life and modern mass politics is able to synthesize
the available observations across disciplines much more coherently. In particular, we have
argued that researchers need to focus on the lack of information in modern mass politics
that fits evolved political cognition. Such a perspective is able to integrate the likely
existence of an evolved psychology for political decision-making with the findings from
political science on the political ignorance of many individuals.
Because human political cognition evolved to operate within a social ecology of
small-scale face-to-face interactions, the operations of political cognition is dependent on
reception of vivid, intimate social information. In the impersonal and abstract domain of
modern mass politics, such information is not readily available and, hence, makes it
difficult to utilize basic evolved systems for social and political judgment. Under specific
conditions, however, individuals are able to compensate for this lack of information and
link evolved cognition to issues of mass politics. Through external exposure to vivid cues
(e.g., specific types of media stories) or by engaging in heavy mental simulation, the
political animal is able to process modern mass politics using the suit of evolved cognitive
mechanisms.
These observations imply that the emerging field of evolutionary political
psychology needs to approach the study of attitudes and behavior on particular political
issues with two sets of considerations. First, what adaptive domain (or domains) does the
specific political issue resemble, if any? That is, what kinds of cognitive mechanisms are
aroused by the threats and challenges involved in a particular political discussion? Second,
what kinds of cues are these cognitive mechanisms using to produce judgments and are
these cues available in the context of lay persons' decision-making on this particular
political issue? The second set of questions, then, requires an analysis of the context in
which the relevant problems reside within modern politics. Only if a given issue can be
psychologically represented as falling within a particular adaptive domain and the relevant
cues for producing judgments within that domain are available, should we expect modern
individuals to find it easy to form political opinions on the issue. If the latter cues are not
available, people might find the issue interesting and important but, at the same time, have
difficulties in making up their minds on it.
While evolved intuitions often structure how individuals think about mass
politics--and make it appear interesting, engaging, and fun--this does not imply that the
resulting judgments are necessarily efficient or adaptive in the context of today. Hence, the
information people find intuitively relevant when producing political choices will be
information of relevance in ancestral, small-scale social environments, and the political
solutions that people will find intuitively correct will be solutions that work within such
environments. In the complex mass society of today, reliance on such information or such
solutions does not necessarily produce optimal outcomes.
