Obesity and the Likelihood of Sexual
Behavioral Risk Factors for HPV
and Cervical Cancer
Christina C. Wee1, Annong Huang1, Karen W. Huskey1 and Ellen P. McCarthy1
Obesity is associated with higher cervical cancer mortality, but its relationship with sexual behavioral risk factors that
predispose women to human papilloma virus (HPV) and cervical cancer is unclear. We used data from 3,329 women
participants, aged 20­59 years, of the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, to analyze the
relationship between BMI and age at first intercourse, number of sexual partners, condom use during sexual activity,
history of sexually transmitted disease (STD), herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) seropositivity, and HPV prevalence. BMI
was not associated with the prevalence of HPV. Mildly obese women (BMI 30.0­34.9kg/m2) were least likely to report a
STD history (9%vs. 13% in normal weight) and 2 sexual partners in the previous year (8%vs. 13%) while overweight
women (BMI 25.0­29.9kg/m2) were least likely to report 10 lifetime partners; among those with multiple partners, BMI
was not associated with sexual activity without condoms in the past month. After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity,
and education, women with higher BMI were less likely to report sexual behavioral risk factors than normal-weight
women; however, odds ratios were only significant for mildly obese women for reporting a STD history (0.74, 95%
confidence interval 0.55­0.99) and having 2 sexual partners in the last year (0.57, 0.39­0.85). Higher BMI was not
associated with HSV-2 seropositivity after adjustment. HPV and sexual behavioral risk factors for HPV and cervical
cancer are not more prevalent in obese than normal-weight women and unlikely to account for higher-observed
cervical cancer mortality in obese women.

Obesity is associated with a higher risk of cancer death includ-
ing deaths from cervical cancer (1). Each year, almost 10,000
women in the United States are diagnosed with invasive cervi-
cal cancer and another 4,000 women die from the disease (2).
Women who are moderately to severely obese are more than
three times as likely to die from cervical cancer as women with
normal body weight (1).
The excess mortality from cervical cancer associated with
obesity is especially astounding given that cervical cancer is
largely a preventable disease. Regular screening using the
Papanicolaou test has been effective in reducing the incidence
of this disease in developed countries (3,4). However, despite
their higher cancer risk, evidence suggests that women with
obesity are less likely to report timely screening for cervical
cancer (5,6). Hence, lower adherence to screening recommen-
dations may contribute to the higher risk of premature death
from cervical cancer observed among obese women.
The human papilloma virus (HPV) is central to the develop-
ment of cervical cancer (7) and has become increasingly preva-
lent (8). Some of these infections are transient but a fraction
of these do lead to cervical changes that progress to cervical
cancer if not detected and treated early. There are also several
serotypes of HPV, some conferring higher risk of malignancy
than others (9,10). HPV is transmitted through sexual activity,
and several modifiable factors have been identified that place
women at higher risk for contracting HPV and in turn lead to
higher risk of cervical cancer. These factors include many ame-
liorable behaviors such as early onset of sexual activity, having
multiple sexual partners, and previous sexually transmitted
disease (STD) (11­16). Few studies have examined whether
the psychosocial consequences of obesity impacts the sexual
behaviors of obese individuals, particularly high-risk behav-
iors that might place women at risk for HPV infection and thus
cervical cancer (17).
In this context, we examined the association between obesity
and the prevalence of several cervical cancer risk factors reported
by participants in the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Study (NHANES) to understand better the contri-
bution of sexual behavioral risk factors to the higher-observed
cervical cancer mortality among women with obesity.

Methods
NHANES is a stratified multistage probability sample of the noninsti-
tutionalized civilian population of the United States conducted by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Center
for Health Statistics (18). NHANES is designed to assess the health and
nutritional status of adults and children and combines both interviews
and physical examination. Beginning in 1999, the study was redesigned
to be an ongoing continuous program. Data are released in 2-year
cycles. Design weights and sampling information are provided so that
analyses that account for the complex sampling design can be general-
ized to the US population.
As part of the interview, participants aged 20­59 years were asked a
series of questions about their health and sexual behavior. We restricted
our study sample to women participants in this age group (n = 4,132).
Questions elicited whether women ever had sexual intercourse, the age
at which they first had sexual intercourse, and the number of sexual part-
ners in the past month, in the past year, and in their lifetime. Among
women who reported sexual activity in the previous month (n = 408),
they were asked the number of times they had intercourse without using a
condom. Participants were also asked about having been diagnosed with
a STD, namely genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, and chlamydia
("Has a doctor ever told you that you had ..."). In addition, women were
also asked about demographic information including age, race and eth-
nicity, and educational level.
All participants underwent physical and laboratory examinations in
mobile examination units. Height and weight were measured, which
we used to calculate BMI. We then categorized participants accord-
ing to standard weight categories (19): normal weight or BMI of
18.5­24.9kg/m2 (served as our reference group), overweight or BMI
of 25.0­29.9kg/m2, class I obesity or BMI 30.0­34.9kg/m2, and class
II­III obesity or BMI 35.0kg/m2 and higher. We excluded women
who were missing either height or weight (n = 52) as well as women
who were underweight (BMI <18.5kg/m2) (n = 80) or who were preg-
nant by history (n = 661) because body weight in these situations
may not reflect stable baseline weights. Blood samples were collected
and tested for herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) antibodies in women
aged 20­49 years. HSV-2 is the cause of most cases of genital herpes,
a STD. A positive antibody test (seropositivity) indicates previous
infection.
Female respondents to the 2003­2004 NHANES were also asked to
submit self-collected cervicovaginal swabs. DNA was extracted using
modifications of the QIAmp Mini Kit protocol within one month of

sample collection, and HPV detection and typing was conducted as
described elsewhere (8). Between January 2003 and April 2004, probes
were performed for 27 HPV serotypes including those that were high
risk (16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 53, 56, 58, 59, 66, 68, 73, 82)
and low risk (6, 11, 40, 42, 54, 55, 83, 84) for cervical cancer. After April,
additional high- (67, 69, 70, IS39) and low-risk (61, 62, 64, 71, 72, 81, 89)
serotypes were probed.
Data analysis
We used bivariable and multivariable statistical analytic methods to
examine the relationship between BMI category and several risk fac-
tors of HPV infections and cervical cancer: age at first intercourse, hav-
ing any history of STD (genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, and
chlamydia), number of lifetime partners (10 partners), whether or not
women had two or more partners in the previous year. Among those
with two or more partners in the previous year who were also sexually
active in the preceding month, we examined the relationship between
BMI and reporting not using condoms at least one or more times in the
preceding month. Finally in the subgroup who submitted adequate cer-
vicovaginal swabs, we studied the association between BMI and HPV
infection. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and education
level. We weighted analyses to reflect US population estimates and used
SUDAAN analytic software (20) to account for the complex stratified
sampling scheme so that appropriate standard errors are derived.
Results
Table 1 characterizes our study sample. Of 3,329 nonpregnant
women aged 20­59 years who had a BMI of 18.5kg/m2, 39%
were normal weight, 27% were overweight, and 34% were
obese. Normal-weight women were significantly younger, were
more likely to be non-Hispanic white, and completed more
years of formal education.
Figure 1 characterizes women's sexual behavioral risk factors
according to BMI before adjustment. Compared to normal-
weight women, women with higher BMI were significantly less
likely to have two or more sexual partners in the previous year.
Obese women with a BMI between 30.0 and 34.9kg/m2 were
the least likely to report a prior history of STD, P = 0.04; how-
ever, women with higher-than-normal BMI had higher rates
of HSV-2 seropositivity. Age of intercourse, number of lifetime
partners, and condom use did not significantly differ across

BMI. BMI was also not significantly associated with active
HPV prevalence; these results were consistent when we limited
the outcome to include only high-risk HPV serotypes.
After adjustment for age, race and ethnicity, and educational
level (Table 2), women with higher-than-normal BMI in gen-
eral were less likely to report higher-risk sexual behaviors.
These results, however, did not achieve statistical significance
except in women with BMIs between 30.0 and 34.9kg/m2 who
were less likely to report a history of STD or having two or
more sexual partners in the previous year. HPV prevalence did
not differ by BMI after adjustment.
Discussion
Our study found that the prevalence of HPV did not vary by
BMI. Women with a higher BMI were no more likely to report
sexual behavioral risk factors that might predispose them to
acquiring HPV infection and developing cervical cancer.
Compared to normal-weight women, women with a higher
BMI were as or less likely to report previous STD, had compa-
rable numbers of lifetime partners, and were as or less likely to
have two or more sexual partners in the previous year; among
those with multiple partners in the previous year, heavier
women were no more likely to have sexual intercourse without
condoms in the previous month. After adjusting for sociode-
mographic factors, heavier women were also no more likely
than normal-weight women to demonstrate objective evidence
of previous genital herpes infection.
Beyond its association with adverse health consequences,
obesity has been shown to result in profound psychosocial con-
sequences (21). Studies suggest that obese individuals are often
viewed as less desirable dating and courtship partners (21­24)
and have difficulty entering into romantic and marriage rela-
tionships (21,25­27). Obese women tend to marry later and
marry less desirable partners even though they do not have
lower marital aspirations than thinner women (28). However,
few studies have examined whether the social stigma associated
with obesity actually affects sexual behavior, particularly high-
risk sexual behavior. A recent analysis by Nagelkerke et al. (17)
using the 1999 and 2000 NHANES sample found that obese
men reported fewer lifetime sexual partners than thinner men
but did not find a similar relationship in women; however,
their sample was only a third the size of ours. Nagelkerke et al.
also examined the relationship between BMI and HSV-2 sero-
positivity, but because of limited sample size, could not exam-
ine obesity's relationship with other STDs or other high-risk
sexual behaviors. Our study confirms the lack of relationship
between obesity and the number of lifetime sexual partners in
Nagelkerke et al.'s earlier work and extends this earlier work
in a larger national sample to include other sexual behaviors
such as the age of first intercourse, common STDs, and the
likelihood of sexual activity without using a condom. We also
found that the prevalence of HPV did not vary by BMI. The
high prevalence of HPV in the general population (8) may
have masked any variation by BMI.
Given our findings, higher death rates from cervical can-
cer in obese women compared to normal women are unlikely
to be due to a higher underlying risk of HPV infection which
is a necessary precursor to developing cervical cancer. Rather,
higher mortality from cervical cancer among obese women
likely reflects lower rates of screening documented by other
studies (5,6). Although the absolute difference in screening rates
are modest, we estimated previously (5) that a reduction of 3.5
and 6% in screening in overweight and obese women during a
3-year screening interval would lead to ~1,200 cases of missed
or delayed diagnoses of invasive cervical cancer, highlighting the
importance of targeting efforts at improved screening.
Although HPV infection is a necessary precursor to the
development of cervical cancer, women who are exposed and
become infected with HPV do not necessarily develop the dis-
ease. In many women, especially those who were exposed at
younger ages, the infection becomes undetectable over time
(29,30). Moreover, the cervical changes that are produced
by HPV progress through several stages before malignancy
results (30). Hence, cervical cancer can be avoided if these cer-
vical changes are detected early enough and intervened upon
through biopsy and colposcopy procedures before the lesions
develop into cervical cancer (30). Whether obese women are
less likely than thinner women to obtain proper follow-up
evaluation and treatment once either HPV or HPV-associated
cervical changes are detected has not been studied.

Our study should be interpreted in the context of its limita-
tions. First, the cross-sectional and observational design pre-
vents us from drawing causal inferences about the relationship
between obesity and high-risk sexual behaviors. This is par-
ticularly the case in the outcome of prior behaviors and STDs
because we have no information on respondents' BMI at the
time of the past behaviors, although there is likely a strong
correlation between past weight and current weight. Second,
sexual behavioral characteristics were assessed exclusively by
self-report and consequently there is likely under-reporting of
socially undesirable behaviors such as high-risk sexual behav-
iors; the NHANES does, however, use an audio computer-
assisted survey interviewer which has been shown to improve
the quality of self-reported data on socially undesirable
behavior (31). Moreover, there is no evidence that any under-
reporting should occur differentially by BMI and given that
the estimates for high-risk behavior for higher-weight women
were consistently lower than their normal-weight counterpart,
it is unlikely that a strong enough weight-related reporting bias
exists that would have altered our conclusions.
In summary, despite the higher risk of death from cervical
cancer observed among women with higher BMI, obesity was
not associated with a higher prevalence of HPV or with sexual
behavioral risk factors that might predispose women to devel-
oping HPV infection and cervical cancer. Higher risk of death
from cervical cancer among obese women are more likely to
be due to previously described disparities in cancer screening
than to differences in underlying behavioral risk factors.
