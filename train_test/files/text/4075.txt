Introduction
Does Size Really Matter?
Surprisingly, this question still remains a matter of debate
(Ambler, Fairchild, & Wilkinson, 2013). In particular,
researchers cannot reach a consensus on whether idiopathic
or "normal" short stature (SS) confers health and psycho-
logical disadvantages. It has been established that SS people
of both genders are subject to stigmatization and prejudice
(Underwood, 1991), and SS children suffer greater psycho-
social stress (Zimet et al., 1997). Conversely, tall stature (TS)
is associated with perception of higher status and achieve-
ment (Jackson & Ervin, 1992; Lechelt, 1975; Wilson, 1968).
However, it remains unclear whether psychosocial stress
associated with SS leads to substantial functional deficits. A
number of large epidemiological studies have found SS to be
associated with poorer mental health (Cheung et al., 2013)
and lower health-related quality of life (Christensen,
Djurhuus, Clayton, & Christiansen, 2007). In men, SS was
additionally associated with poor educational achievement
(Magnusson, Rasmussen, & Gyllensten, 2006) and higher
risk of suicide (Magnusson, Rasmussen, Lawlor, Tynelius, &
Gunnell, 2006). Other studies have concluded that height has
negligible effect on health-related quality of life (Busschbach,
Rikken, Grobbee, De Charro, & Wit, 1997; Coste, Pouchot,
& Carel, 2012). Some studies on SS children did not find
them significantly less well psychologically adjusted than
their taller counterparts (Downie, Mulligan, Stratford, Betts,
& Voss, 1997; Ulph, Betts, Mulligan, & Stratford, 2004).
Multiple factors may have contributed to this contradic-
tion. Samples were drawn from different cultures, where
societal attitudes to SS may differ; samples comprised differ-
ent age brackets; and different measurements were used to
assess people's psychological adjustment and quality of life.
Perhaps most important, the researchers framed their ques-
tion differently.
Some put the emphasis on whether SS may compromise
people's competitiveness, as in the mentioned studies dem-
onstrating the link between SS and lower academic achieve-
ments and perceived social status (Magnusson, Rasmussen,
& Gyllensten, 2006; Magnusson, Rasmussen, Lawlor, et al.,
2006). Others emphasized the question of whether SS
directly affected functioning of short people. These research-
ers, for example (Coste et al., 2012), mostly focused on
meticulously controlling for confounding variables such as
socioeconomic status, parental education, health problems,
and so on. After controlling for those variables, they found
only "negligible" effects of SS, suggesting that these effects
are largely mediated by other, likely social, factors.
Studies of stature's effects on health and psychological
adjustment did not specifically address the possible

Size Matters Stature Is Related to
Diagnoses of Depression in Young Military
Men
Valery Krupnik1 and Mariya V. Cherkasova2
Abstract
Evolutionary theories suggest that depression has evolved as an adaptation to insurmountable adversity or defeat. One
prediction stemming from these models is that individual attributes associated with defeat in a given social environment could
be risk factors for depression. We hypothesized that in young military men, where physical prowess was important, short
stature might constitute a risk of depression and that this risk would be specific to depression and not to other prevalent
mental disorders such as anxiety. A preliminary analysis of the diagnostic profile of a sample of male military personnel
treated for mental health indicates that men both shorter and taller than average by 1 standard deviation may be predisposed
to higher rates of depressive but not anxiety disorders. Practical and theoretical implications of our findings are discussed.

mediating role of stature as a marker of men's social rank.
One of the effects of stature on social rank is its role in mat-
ing competition. Men's height correlates positively with their
attractiveness to women and mating success (Pawlowski,
Dunbar, & Lipowicz, 2000; Pierce, 1996). Importantly,
men's height is not linearly related to female mating prefer-
ences but has a U-shaped relationship, where both ends of
the distribution show lower values than the above-average
middle, although the short end is still inferior to the tall one
(Hensley, 1994). As the authors of another study stated,
"shortness is more of a liability than tallness is an asset";
they also demonstrated TS's association with perception of
high social rank (Jackson & Ervin, 1992, p 433). The very
concept of masculinity is regarded as both bodily and cultur-
ally embedded with a complex relationship between the two
realms, which has led to the notion of multiple masculinities
and hegemonic masculinity as their overarching vector
(Connell & Connell, 2005; Connell & Messerschmidt, 2005),
where stature is but one contributing factor.
Even if the difference in psychological adjustment of
short people is largely explained by concomitant social vari-
ables, the causal relationship (or lack thereof) between them
and SS still needs to be elucidated. Evolutionary theory sug-
gests organism's inherited attributes, such as SS, as primary
targets of environmental pressure. In application to men, it
would mean that their SS as a marker of lower status would
make them more vulnerable and shape their response to
social pressure.
Involuntary Subordination
Defeat, social defeat in particular, has been identified as a
core psychological state in depression (Gilbert, 2006). It has
been conceptualized as a loss of social rank in a direct con-
flict or competition, which may result in depression-like
symptoms including behavioral and social withdrawal, and
subordinate behavior. Accordingly, depressive response has
been conceptualized as an adaptation to defeat or involuntary
subordination (Gilbert, 2006; Gilbert & Allan, 1998; Price,
Sloman, Gardner, Gilbert, & Rohde, 1994). Submission can
be adaptive, as it may help avoid a potentially lethal or dam-
aging confrontation, thus increasing the fitness of the
subordinate.
An animal model of depression based on social defeat
was established a long time ago (Kudryavtseva,
Bakshtanovskaya, & Koryakina, 1991). In its current form, it
consists of repeated forced exposure of individual mice to
larger and more aggressive ones. Such exposure produces a
depressive-like phenotype. Importantly, this phenotype can
be reversed by chronic but not acute administration of a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant,
which supports the model's validity (Golden, Covington,
Berton, & Russo, 2011).
In humans, as in other animals, subordinate social status
is associated with high chronic stress, depressive reactions,
and poorer health (Sapolsky, 2004). Moreover, perceived
social rank was found in closer association with health indi-
cators than actual one (Adler, Epel, Castellazzo, & Ickovics,
2000). In humans, much of the research on social defeat has
been conducted in the bully/victim paradigm that is believed
to parallel the dominant versus subordinate model in other
animals (Björkqvist, 2001). Victims, like subordinate ani-
mals, have been shown to suffer from chronic stress and
depressive symptoms (Björkqvist, 2001). However, bullies
have also been found to be at a greater risk of depression
compared with general population (Kaltiala-Heino, Rimpelä,
Marttunen, Rimpelä, & Rantanen, 1999).
Adolescence is an age when social standing among peers
assumes high importance. In a study of a sample of adoles-
cent boys in an all-boys school, their status in peer hierarchy
correlated positively with self-esteem and negatively with
their rate of depression (Fournier, 2009). Subjective social
status has been shown to negatively correlate with depres-
sive symptoms in a large sample of adolescents (Goodman et
al., 2001).
Body size is likely an important contributor to social sta-
tus, although it is but one of many contributing factors such
as aggression, age, affiliations, social history, and so on (see
Chase, Tovey, Spangler-Martin, & Manfredonia, 2002, for
review). In adult humans of the industrialized world, height
is a readily observable, easily measurable variable that is
constant and independent of psychosocial factors. As men-
tioned above, it affects psychological adjustment and quality
of life, with SS being perceived as a marker of low status.
Hypothesis
Our hypothesis stems from two independent evolutionary-
based premises reviewed above: (a) that depressive symp-
toms evolved as an adaptive response to defeat, social defeat
in particular; (b) that in men, height is a marker of masculin-
ity, perceived mating value, and status. We hypothesized that
in young men SS led to higher prevalence of depressive
symptoms but not necessarily other common mental health
symptoms such as anxiety.
Idiopathic SS is an out-of-group phenomenon usually
defined as 2 standard deviations (SD) below the mean height
of the reference population, one that matches in sex and age
(Ranke, 1996). In order for SS to serve as a marker of status,
an SS individual must be perceived as such among his peers,
for which a threshold of significant shortness should be
reached. Therefore, correlation between height and preva-
lence of depressive symptoms in men (if present) is also
expected to be an out-of-group phenomenon, that is, no sig-
nificant correlation is expected within the group. Once some-
one is perceived short statured, he is already stigmatized, and
it matters relatively little how short he is within the SS group.
The same is expected for the "normal" stature group. Then
the highest correlation between height and depressive symp-
toms may be expected at the group's margin. The height
Krupnik and Cherkasova 3
polymorphism in a given population is likely to affect the
sensitivity of out-of-group perception and, consequently, the
sensitivity of the hypothesized correlation. For example, a
threshold of 0.5 SD in a low polymorphism population may
be perceived as significant as 1 SD in a high polymorphism
one.
Another prediction from our hypothesis is that the effects
of SS are more pronounced in settings of intense intramale
social competition, especially where physique is considered
important.
In line with the situation­symptom congruency hypothe-
sis (Keller & Nesse, 2006), the association of depressive
symptoms with SS should be specific to some but not other
symptoms that are unlikely to have evolved as an adaptation
to social defeat. For example, we do not expect SS to be
associated with increased anxiety because anxiety is not a
useful adaptation to social defeat.
We made a preliminary observation in a group of active
duty military men who received mental health care. That was
a suitable model group as it consisted of young physically
healthy men in a competitive mostly male environment,
where physical prowess was valued.
Method
The data were taken from records of a mental health clinic
serving active duty military personnel. We randomly selected
a relatively homogeneous sample of 196 healthy (no major
diagnosis of somatic illness) males of Caucasian background.
Ethnic/racial groups may represent distinct reference popula-
tions because their mean body heights differ. Caucasians
constituted a majority of the patients and were chosen as a
sample for our analysis. As we were interested in depressive
symptoms, we chose patients carrying depression-related
diagnoses. Patients with anxiety-related diagnoses were
taken as a control group representing the most prevalent
cluster of mental disorders (Kessler et al., 2005). The diagno-
ses were established as part of routine care by mental health
providers of the clinic (either psychiatrists or PhD-level psy-
chologists, who were uninvolved in this project) according to
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association [APA],
1994).The sample's demographics and diagnostic profile are
presented in Table 1.
To capture the severity of our patients' condition along
either depression or anxiety axis, we ranked their disorders
according to the diagnostic hierarchy reflected in DSM-
IV/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder
(5th ed.; DSM-5;APA, 2013) and used the rank as a proxy for
severity. Among depressive/depression-related disorders, the
lowest in that hierarchy are the residual categories such as
adjustment disorder with depressed mood and depression
(not otherwise specified [NOS]) because these diagnoses are
not given when the criteria for specific depressive disorders
are met. So we rated them lower than the specific diagnoses
of dysthymia and major depression and assigned relative val-
ues as follows: adjustment disorder with depressed mood--
1, depression NOS--1, dysthymic disorder--2, major
depressive disorder--2. We assigned relative values to anxi-
ety-related disorders following the same logic: adjustment
disorder with anxiety--1, anxiety NOS--1, generalized anx-
iety and panic, disorders--2. When an individual carried
more than one diagnosis, he was assigned the highest value
along both axes, for example, someone with depression NOS
and major depressive disorders would be rated at 2, likewise,
a patient with anxiety disorder NOS and panic disorder
would be rated at 2.
The mean height was 178.7 cm (SD = 7), which is close to
that of Caucasian males in the United States (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2014)--176.0 cm. Military
ranks in our sample were rated follows: privates--Category
1, lance corporals--Category 2, corporals--Category 3,

sergeants--Category 4, staff sergeants--Category 5, and
above staff sergeants--Category 6 (for the purposes of the
analyses, the highest ranks were considered as one category).
The total sample was divided into three groups: SS--1 SD
below the mean, lesser than 172 cm; TS--1 SD above the
mean, greater than 185 cm, and average stature (AS)--
between 172 and 185 cm. We included the TS group in our
analysis as a control group of height outliers.
We compared the three height groups (SS, AS, and TS) on
severity of depression and anxiety diagnoses using one-way
ANCOVAs with rank as a covariate considered as 6 catego-
ries. In addition, we performed a confirmatory analysis,
where depression and anxiety diagnoses were used as yes/no
dichotomous variables.
Results
Aone-wayANOVAcomparing the three groups (SS,AS, and
TS) on depression severity revealed a significant effect of
Group, F(2, 193) = 4.13; p = .02. Post hoc Least Significant
Difference pairwise comparisons showed that both short
individuals and tall individuals had significantly higher prev-
alence of depression diagnoses than AS individuals, short
versus average: t(155) = 2.24; p = .03; tall versus average
t(168) = 2.04; p = .04; short and tall individuals did not differ
from each other (Figure 1). Because the distribution of
depression severity scores deviated from normality, we con-
firmed the significance of these findings with nonparametric
tests. The Mann­Whitney U test confirmed that both SS and
TS individuals had significantly higher depression scores
than AS individuals (SS: p = .02; TS: p = .04).
A one-way ANOVA comparing the three groups (SS, AS,
and TS) on anxiety severity did not reveal a significant effect
of Group, F(2, 193) = 2.74; p = .11.
We next explored potentially relevant demographic and
experiential covariates for inclusion into the primary analy-
ses of the relationship between height and diagnostic
severity. We found that number of combat deployments and
military rank both negatively correlated with depression
severity, deployments: Rho(196) = -.26; p < .0005; rank:
Rho(196) = -.18; p = .01. This is in agreement with the ear-
lier demonstrated correlation between military rank and stat-
ure (Mazur, Mazur, & Keating, 1984). Marital status was
positively related to anxiety, Rho(196) = .16; p = .02, while
age was not related to diagnoses. We therefore reanalyzed
the data considering these covariates. In our analysis of
depression, we did not consider the number of deployments
as an appropriate covariate as the number of deployments
was negatively associated with depression severity, and we
reasoned it more likely that poorer functioning and perfor-
mance in more depressed individuals resulted in fewer
deployments, rather than more deployments improving
depression symptoms. If so, using the number of deploy-
ments as a covariate would eliminate important depression-
related variance. Hence, we only considered military rank as
a covariate in the one-way ANCOVA comparing the three
groups (SS, AS, and TS) on depression severity. The analysis
revealed a significant effect of Group, F(2, 192) = 3.52; p =
.03, and a significant effect of rank, F(1, 192) = 4.28; p = .04.
Post hoc least significant difference pairwise comparisons
confirmed that both short individuals and tall individuals had
higher prevalence of depression diagnoses than AS individu-
als though the difference between short and average individ-
uals was at trend level (short vs. average: p = .06; tall vs.
average p = .03). The ANCOVA comparing the three height
groups on anxiety severity with marital status as a covariate
revealed a significant effect of marital status, F(1, 192) =
6.87; p = .009, but the effect of group was not significant,
F(2, 192) = 2.51; p = .08.
Finally, we examined whether the presence of any clini-
cally significant depression or anxiety differed as a function
of height group. The chi-square test revealed that there were
more depression diagnoses in the TS than AS individuals,
2(170) = 6.62, p = .01, and there was a trend suggesting
more depression diagnoses in SS than AS individuals,
2(157) = 2.95, p = .07. For anxiety diagnoses, there were no
significant differences between the groups (ps > .13).
There was no statistically significant correlation between
height and symptoms prevalence in either the whole sample
or within the groups (ps > .45).
Discussion
We present a preliminary analysis of diagnostic profiles of
young male military personnel in relation to their height. We
chose 1 SD cutoff for outlier SS and TS groups rather than
the commonly accepted for idiopathic SS 2 SD, because a
larger cutoff, for example, 1.5 SD, would have included only
eight short men and significantly undercut the statistical
power. Besides, using the 2 SD cutoff would be impossible
because those men could not be recruited to the military. The
sample available to us was of a relatively small size and

afforded a limited scope of information; also, we had to rely
on diagnostic impression of clinicians rather than standard
measures of anxiety and depression. Still, the findings vali-
date our initial suggestion that SS in men is associated with a
higher level of depression but not anxiety (Figure 1) and that
this is an out-of-group effect. Absolute body height was
uncorrelated with the rates of depressive and anxiety diagno-
ses in our sample, and difference was only found, when outli-
ers were compared with the rest. This is in accord with our
prediction that the perception of being SS rather than abso-
lute height adversely affects men's psychological well-being.
The trend of SS servicemen showing higher levels of depres-
sion remained after accounting for rank as a covariate
although falling short of statistical significance (p = .06). The
connection between SS and lower rank has been demon-
strated before (Mazur et al., 1984), which confirms the gen-
eral notion of short men achieving lower social status.
The analysis has revealed additional tendencies beyond
the initial hypothesis. The most important among them is the
finding that TS servicemen show elevated levels of depres-
sion, as SS do (Figure 1).
Which Size Matters?
Our initial hypothesis made no stipulations about TS men.
On the surface, it may appear that while SS is a psychologi-
cal vulnerability, being tall should provide protection and
foster psychological well-being, because tallness is a marker
of status and competitiveness. The important question, how-
ever, is how tall. The taller the better may not necessarily
hold true. The available data on the effects of height on men's
status and achievements show that inordinately TS carries no
benefits. Men's attractiveness, for example, was shown to
have a U-shaped relation to height with both tails of distribu-
tion losing to the above-average middle (Hensley, 1994), and
so was men's chance to be married (Manfredini, Breschi,
Fornasin, & Seghieri, 2013).
Even if very tall men do not outcompete their counter-
parts of average to above-average height, it still leaves the
question of their higher vulnerability to depression open. The
answer to it has, by necessity, to be highly speculative at this
point. One possibility to consider is that vulnerability of tall
men may lie in their very strength. Perceived as highly domi-
nant by others and themselves, these individuals may hold
overinflated expectations of their performance and success,
which may make them more vulnerable to instances of
defeat, when they happen. That may elicit depressive
response in very tall men with a higher frequency compared
with men of AS.
It is also conceivable that marginalization itself is a
depressogenic factor, regardless of the stature's value. There
is a large literature on vulnerability of marginalized groups to
anxiety and depression (for a recent review, see Pieterse,
Todd, Neville, & Carter, 2012). However, to our knowledge
there have been no reports indicating that marginalization
can have a differential effect on depression versus anxiety as
in our case. We, therefore, favor a more nuanced explanation
that considers interaction of status and marginalization with
depressive and anxiety responses to them, as explicated
below.
Depressive Versus Anxiety Response
The relationship between anxiety and depression has been of
considerable interest for a long time. The two are highly
comorbid, for example (Kessler, Nelson, McGonagle, & Liu,
1996), and anxiety is listed as an associated feature of major
depression in DSM-5. Still, both depressive and anxiety
symptoms may present separately. Several models account
for interdependence and relative independence of anxiety
and depression, including the descriptive dimensional model
developed by Watson and Clark (Clark & Watson, 1991;
Watson, 2005) and Higgins's regulatory focus theory
(Higgins, 1998; Klenk, Strauman, & Higgins, 2011).
According to these models, there is a continuum of relation-
ship between anxiety and depressive symptoms from inverse
to concomitant.
Regulatory focus theory suggests that two autonomous
but interacting systems are responsible for development of
anxiety and depressive symptoms. The prevention system is
responsible for negotiating threats, and its dysregulation may
lead to anxiety symptoms, while the promotion system is
responsible for meeting the organism's needs, and its inhibi-
tion may lead to depressive symptoms. It is also hypothe-
sized that the promotion and prevention systems are mutually
inhibitory, which explains the high comorbidity of anxiety
and depression--as the promotion system is downregulated,
leading to depression, the prevention one is activated result-
ing in increased anxiety and vice versa (Higgins, 1998). This
theory also implies a rather intuitive possibility that there are
two main strategies to respond to adversity: anxiety and
depressive responses that may to a certain extent be either
mutually exclusive or complementary. This may account for
instances of both separate and comorbid anxiety and depres-
sion. Depending on learned experience, genetic makeup, and
cost­benefit analysis of a particular circumstance, individu-
als may rely more either on depressive or anxiety strategy.
From the premise that depressive symptoms evolved as a
response to insurmountable adversity, lack of concomitant
anxiety symptoms makes sense as responding with anxiety
to a situation that can neither be avoided nor corrected would
be maladaptive. In this sense, depressive response may be
considered a defense against anxiety. Indeed, it has been sug-
gested that depression evolved as a defense or a shutdown
mechanism against separation distress in mammal infants
(Watt & Panksepp, 2009). That view is in an apparent contra-
diction with the regulatory focus theory because it proposes
that inhibition of the motivation (promotion) system leads to
shutdown of separation distress, which can only be achieved
by inhibiting the separation anxiety.
6 SAGE Open
This contradiction can be reconciled by looking at the
interaction of depressive and anxiety response from a
dynamic perspective. It is possible that the initial stage of
depression does indeed release anxiety, whereas at a later
stage, as the depressive response matures it leads to inhibi-
tion of anxiety, resulting in transition from the "protest" to
"despair" phase (Bowlby, 1980). These considerations await
a more precise knowledge about the mechanisms involved in
the interaction of the circuitries involved in depressive and
anxiety responses.
The idea that depressive response may protect from exces-
sive anxiety is also noteworthy because it may reconcile the
biggest challenge for evolutionary theories of depression,
namely, its recurrent nature. It has been observed that a
depressive episode increases the probability of consecutive
episodes (Solomon et al., 2000), which can hardly be consid-
ered adaptive and has been a major critique of regarding
depression as an adaptation (Nettle, 2004). Yet, if depressive
response can indeed protect from anxiety, once learned it is
likely to be facilitated in the following encounters with
adversity. In an environment with more repetitive and, there-
fore, highly predictable threats, such strategy can be adaptive
because it would shorten or eliminate the initial counterpro-
ductive "protest" phase.
In our sample, SS and TS men had higher rates of depres-
sive but not anxiety diagnoses compared with AS men
(Figure 1). This finding has led to a post hoc extension of our
hypothesis to suggest that SS and TS men adapt to their mar-
ginal status by engaging the depressive response and disen-
gaging anxiety because marginalization by stature cannot be
undone.
The psychology of SS has not yet been thoroughly stud-
ied. It is still an open question what personality traits and
cognitive styles might mediate the effect of SS on vulnerabil-
ity to depression. Our model may be a doorway to addressing
this question, as it suggests that SS (and maybe TS) may bias
male development toward more depressive than anxiety
response to stress.
Pathological Depression Versus Adaptive
Depressive Response
There is currently no unitary theoretical framework for
depression, even though a variety of risk factors and mecha-
nisms have been identified ranging from biological to psy-
chological to social (Bogdan, Nikolova, & Pizzagalli, 2012).
Rather than addressing the mechanisms of depression, evolu-
tionary theory seeks an explanation of the origin and purpose
of the depressive process as a systemic response to environ-
mental pressure, thus going beyond the mechanistic question
"how" to tackle the teleological "why." A number of evolu-
tionary theories of depression have been proposed and peri-
odically reviewed (Keller & Nesse, 2006; Nettle, 2004; Watt
& Panksepp, 2009). All evolutionary theories converge on
the idea that depressive reaction has evolved as an adaptive
response to insurmountable adversity, where behavioral and
hedonic withdrawal is the main adaptive strategy achieved
by downregulation of the motivation/reward system.
Evolutionary theory may provide useful guidance for psy-
chotherapeutic intervention because it considers depressive
response an adaptation and, accordingly, focuses on the strat-
egies distressed organisms use to adapt to adversities and on
those strategies' effectiveness and weakness. This view is
compatible with the main goals of therapeutic encounter,
where better emotional, behavioral, and cognitive responses
to the patient's predicament are sought. Indeed, a recently
developed therapy for depression is based on evolutionary
theory and aims at facilitating adaptive depressive response
(Krupnik, 2014).
From the epidemiological standpoint, evolutionary theory
does not offer a clear prediction regarding the rates of depres-
sion in populations with chronically elevated stress, as mar-
ginalized groups are believed to be. On one hand, such
groups are expected to manifest higher frequency of depres-
sive symptoms, if we consider those symptoms adaptive
reactions to stress. On the other hand, we might not expect a
higher rate of debilitating depression than in the general pop-
ulation, as these individuals may develop greater resilience,
and low intensity depressive response may provide sufficient
protection. Indeed, it has been argued that although short
people experience psychosocial pressure related to their SS,
they are able to use their resilience mechanisms to compen-
sate for this disadvantage (Sandberg & Colsman, 2005;
Sandberg & Voss, 2002). Epidemiological studies comparing
SS people with the general population commonly use health-
related quality-of-life questionnaires that include questions
about symptoms of anxiety and depression (Coste et al.,
2012). Although these questionnaires quantify people's per-
ception of their general mental health as affected by "stress,
depression, and problems with emotions," they do not iden-
tify the presence of clinically significant syndromes such as
depressive, anxiety, or stress-related disorders. It is assumed
that all symptoms on the continuum of severity indicate psy-
chological deficit or poor adjustment.
This raises two related questions. If symptoms of depres-
sion are a manifestation of an adaptive depressive response,
is there a level of severity, where such response becomes
maladaptive? If indeed there is a threshold, where adaptive
depressive response turns maladaptive, does it correspond to
the symptoms severity constituting a syndrome diagnosed as
clinical (major) depression?
Regarding the first question, there are two main groups of
evolutionary theories, whose opinions differ. Some argue
that only depressive symptoms/traits are an adaptation, while
depression as an illness is maladaptive--the "soft" theory
(Gilbert & Allan, 1998; Nesse, 2000; Sloman, Gilbert, &
Hasey, 2003), whereas others maintain that depression as an
illness is adaptive too--the "hard" theory (Hagen, 1999;
Price et al., 1994; Watson & Andrews, 2002). With respect to
the second question, some psychiatrists believe that up to a
Krupnik and Cherkasova 7
certain threshold depressive symptoms do not constitute
pathology and that the current classification of depressive
disorders is too inclusive, which has led to overdiagnosing of
depression (Parker, 2007; Wakefield & Schmitz, 2013).
Indeed, in DSM-5, the diagnosis of major depression includes
four levels of severity, and there are several additional diag-
noses of depressive disorders.
The premise that up to a certain degree of severity depres-
sive symptoms do not represent a deficit or pathology but are
a manifestation of adaptive response to stress could reconcile
the controversy about the effect of SS on mental health. Both
sides may be correct in their assertions: SS people may expe-
rience higher stress and manifest more depressive symptoms
but not necessarily suffer from higher rates of clinical/major
depression. The available data lack the diagnostic specificity
needed to make such conclusion.
End of the Controversy?
We believe that controversy about the effects of SS is partly
due to (a) pathologizing the issue and (b) insufficient speci-
ficity in asking the questions about SS. As has been persua-
sively argued by the opponents of the use of growth hormone
therapy for enhancement purposes, idiopathic SS is not an
illness (Sandberg & Colsman, 2005). Whereas it is true that
tall men have a significant and consistent advantage over
short ones (Nettle, 2002), it appears no more of a health issue
than the advantage attractive people have over less attractive
ones. Then it becomes a personal choice whether and how to
compensate for it.
It appears rather obvious that a general question whether
size matters has been answered positively. However, it is also
clear that it matters, where it matters. We believe that contra-
dicting findings about the effects of SS resulted in part from
the lack of agreed on specific target groups and that future
research should address this possibility. According to our
hypothesis, the effects of SS should be greatest in groups
with intense intramale social competition, especially where
physical prowess and appearance count. Our sample of
young military men is but one example. Another prediction
of our hypothesis was that men would be more affected by
SS than women as height had presumably less importance
for female social status. Indeed, mental health of men but not
women was found to be affected by SS (Coste et al., 2012).
In a recent large epidemiological study, the authors have
shown that after controlling for a significant number of vari-
ables affecting life quality, such as health, socioeconomic
status, and life circumstances, SS still has a significant nega-
tive effect on the sense of well-being in young men (Carrieri
& De Paola, 2012). They have also shown that most impor-
tant is the perceived stature, that is, body height relative to
the reference group, which confirms the notion of stature as
a marker of social status in young men. The importance of
perceived stature has been recently demonstrated in an ele-
gant experiment, where the perceived stature of the
participants was manipulated with a virtual reality device
(Freeman et al., 2013).
Should future research confirm our hypothesis that SS in
men increases their vulnerability to depression, it will have a
straightforward practical application. To our knowledge,
there are no preventive programs specifically targeting
shorter boys. We believe that such programs implemented in
school could be beneficial for them in developing higher
resilience to the pressure of low social status based on body
height. It has been documented that parents sometimes opt
for growth hormone therapy to increase their children's
height, a practice of questionable effectiveness, which has
raised safety and ethical concerns (Sandberg & Colsman,
2005; Sandberg & Voss, 2002). Psychological intervention
would obviate those concerns and may prove effective in
long-term outcomes.
