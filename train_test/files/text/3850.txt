Putting the ``You'' in ``Thank You'': Examining
Other-Praising Behavior as the Active
Relational Ingredient in Expressed Gratitude
Sara B. Algoe1, Laura E. Kurtz1, and Nicole M. Hilaire2
Abstract
Although positive emotions as a class can build interpersonal resources, recent evidence suggests a unique and direct role for
gratitude. In the current research, we shine the spotlight on what happens between a grateful person and the benefactor to
illuminate what can build a bridge between them. Specifically, we draw on work calling gratitude an ``other-praising'' emotion. In an
original study and a conceptual replication that included two independent samples, couples had video-recorded conversations in
which one member expressed gratitude to the other (n ¼ 370). Expresser's other-praising behavior was robustly positively
associated with the benefactor's postinteraction perception of expresser responsiveness, personal good feelings in general, and
felt loving in particular. Several practical and theoretical alternative explanations are ruled out. By clarifying the specific behavioral
and subjective psychological mechanisms through which expressed gratitude promotes relationships, this work advances affective
and relationship science, two domains that cut across disciplines within psychology.

Gratitude is a positively valenced emotion that can arise when
another person--a benefactor--does something kind for the self.
Although positive emotions in general are thought to build inter-
personal relationships through momentarily broadened cogni-
tions (Fredrickson, 1998; Fredrickson, Cohn, Coffey, Pek, &
Finkel, 2008), recent work suggests a unique and more direct
path to beneficial relational outcomes through the specific emo-
tion of gratitude (Algoe & Haidt, 2009; Algoe, Haidt, & Gable,
2008). Particularly, theory positions gratitude as having evolved
to help solve a central problem of human survival: identifying
high-quality relationship partners and keeping them interested
in the relationship (Algoe, 2012). That is, gratitude helps one
to find new or remind one of current good relationship partners
and to bind the two more strongly together. Now, the pressing
question is, ``How?'' Here, we go back to basics, starting with
theory about what sets gratitude apart from other related positive
emotional states as well as the behavior that is most proximal to
the experience of the emotion, its expression. We suggest and
provide the first direct test of whether the theorized ``other-prais-
ing'' feature of gratitude is central to its implications for building
social bridges.
Gratitude and Social Outcomes
Given prior theory and evidence, many researchers in the
broader social and personality psychology literature would
likely base predictions about how expressed gratitude may
influence a relationship partner simply on the fact that it is pos-
itive in valence (see Fredrickson's broaden-and-build theory of
positive emotions, 1998, 2001, and evidence in Fredrickson
et al., 2008, 2013). With few exceptions, this also holds for
researchers specifically within the relationships literature as
well as the emotions literature. However, moving beyond gen-
eral positive valence, Algoe recently paired insights from the
emotions literature that differentiate gratitude from other posi-
tive emotions (e.g., Algoe & Haidt, 2009) with insights from
the relationships literature differentiating among relationship
norms (e.g., Clark & Mills, 2011) to formally propose that the
positive emotion of gratitude is uniquely suited for promoting
relationships with high-quality relationship partners (2012).
Importantly, the theory pushes for specificity of interpersonal
mechanisms and calls for data from the target of one's grati-
tude, the original benefactor.
For example, this find-remind-and-bind theory hypothesizes
that a grateful person will draw in a benefactor by demonstrat-
ing responsiveness to the benefactor's needs (Algoe, 2012).

Two studies involving each member of ongoing relationships
now provide initial evidence for this possibility (Algoe,
Fredrickson, & Gable, 2013; Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016). In
them, a benefactor rated a grateful person's responsiveness
after being thanked by that person in a laboratory-based conver-
sation--that is, benefactors rated how understood, validated, and
cared for they felt during the interaction with the grateful person
(Reis, Clark, & Holmes, 2004); when benefactors perceived
greater responsiveness in the grateful person's gesture, they felt
better about their lives and were more satisfied with the relation-
ship in subsequent weeks or months. Importantly, these results
held even when controlling for or comparing to perceptions of
the partner's responsiveness in other validated relationship-
relevant social interactions in the lab, including one that was also
positive in valence: There is something unique about expressed
gratitude (Algoe et al., 2013; Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016). In the
current work, we put a grateful person and his or her benefactor
in the room together and observe what transpires between them
to address what that might be.
Is Other-Praising the Active Relational Ingredient
in Expressed Gratitude?
Following a formative review of the psychological literature on
gratitude (McCullough, Kilpatrick, Emmons, & Larson, 2001),
Haidt took the novel approach of considering the place of gra-
titude within the positive emotion family (2003). Specifically,
building on a prior attribution model of emotions (Ortony,
Clore, & Collins, 1988), he called gratitude one of the other-
praising emotions (2003). This is because gratitude was charac-
terized as an emergent property of two attributions about the
situation: That there had been a positive outcome for the self
(the core attribution for joy) and that the outcome was caused
by the praiseworthy actions of another (the core attribution for
admiration; Ortony et al., 1988).
Notably, this means that a very closely related positive emo-
tional state to gratitude is ``joy'' or ``happiness'' at receiving a
positive outcome for the self. Because happiness has been used
as the generic stand-in for ``positive emotion'' in the majority
of prior research, it is already known that the expression of gen-
eral positive emotions has effects on perceivers that may make
the expresser more attractive as an interaction partner. For
example, those perceived to be happy (e.g., via a smile) are
rated as more likeable, kinder, are more likely to be helped, and
may even make social partners happy (see review in Clark &
Monin, 2014). Intriguingly, some of these outcomes--likeable,
kinder, and more likely to be helped--have also been found in
experimental research that compares effects of receiving a
``thank you'' versus not receiving a thank you (Grant & Gino,
2010; Williams & Bartlett, 2015). Are the documented social
consequences of gratitude expressions simply due to the fact
that the expressions are positively valenced?
Empirical work comparing joy to gratitude provides clues
about differentiation. This work suggests that the grateful expe-
rience may be accompanied by other-praising behavior, which,
in turn, may help account for the unique relational trajectory of
gratitude (Algoe & Haidt, 2009). Critical analyses relied on
recalled joy (and gratitude) narratives, in which someone else
caused the positive outcome for the participant--that is, a ben-
efactor was identified by the participant. Even still, participants
in the gratitude condition were more likely than those in the joy
condition to spontaneously report having seen new positive
qualities in their benefactors, were more likely to thank and hug
their benefactor, and reported singing the praises of the bene-
factor to third parties (Study 1). In the current work, we capi-
talize on the recently used expressed gratitude paradigm
(e.g., Algoe et al., 2013) to test for the first time whether
other-praising behavior of the grateful person can account for
key relationship-promoting outcomes for the benefactor. Criti-
cally, we are able to statistically account for other positive
expressive behavior that would be similar to expressing one's
joy, providing a conservative test of the unique relational value
of other-praising behavior (Algoe & Haidt, 2009).
Examining the Social Interaction
Emotional expressions are theoretically the most proximal
behavior to the experience of an emotion and the inputs to an
emotional experience are thought to shape its output (Lerner
& Keltner, 2000). As such, we assume we can observe each
theorized input component of gratitude--perceived benefits
to the self and the praiseworthiness of the other's actions
(Haidt, 2003; Ortony et al., 1988)--in the behavioral outputs
within video-recorded verbal expressions of gratitude. As ini-
tial evidence, previous research has documented that expres-
sers do spontaneously use other-praising behavior within
these conversations (Algoe & Way, 2014).
Our primary outcome for these conversations, based on the-
ory and recent findings (e.g., Algoe & Zhaoyang, 2016), is the
benefactor's perception of expresser responsiveness. As indi-
cated, perceived responsiveness is comprised of feeling under-
stood, validated, and cared for (Reis et al., 2004). Praising
offers direct validation of the person's actions, so we see
other-praising behavior as a relatively direct way that respon-
siveness can be conveyed. Moreover, testing this, while
accounting for other expressed positive emotion, operationa-
lized here as expressing benefits to the self (akin to expressed
joy/happiness), would provide an important first step toward
documenting that the relational consequences of expressed gra-
titude are not simply explained by its positive valence.
Additionally, we examine the benefactor's positive emo-
tions as a secondary outcome. As reviewed earlier, momentary
positive emotions are theorized to lay a foundation for growth
in social resources (see Fredrickson, 1998), so they may pro-
vide an additional path for social consequences from expressed
gratitude. As such, following recent work (Algoe & Way,
2014), we examine an aggregated measure of positive emotions
and one that is theoretically relevant in this context--felt lov-
ing (see Gonzaga, Turner, Keltner, Campos, & Altemus,
2006). We expect that hearing praise for one's behavior will
make one feel happy (i.e., general positive emotions) and lov-
ing. Simultaneously, positive emotions have long been
Algoe et al. 659
theorized as ``contagious'' (see Fowler & Christakis, 2008;
Hatfield, Cacioppo, & Rapson, 1993), and in this context,
learning that one's kind gesture hit the mark may feel good
(e.g., Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2008). As such, our exploration
of whether self-benefit expression is positively associated with
the benefactor's positive emotions after the conversation pro-
vides additional contributions to the broader literature.
The Current Research
In Study 1, we use a tightly controlled design to test whether
other-praising behavior, independent from a focus on benefits
to the self within the same conversation, uniquely predicts the
benefactor's subjective experience. Then, we conceptually
replicate these findings using an integrated data analysis (Cur-
ran & Hussong, 2009) of two similar but independent studies.
There, we also measure the benefactor's perception of expres-
ser's positive emotions. Each study addresses several theoreti-
cally and practically derived alternative explanations.
Study 1
Participants and Procedure
Within a larger observational study, each member of 73 hetero-
sexual couples (n ¼ 146) from the region surrounding Chapel
Hill, NC, attended a lab session during which they each
expressed gratitude to the other for a recent event (see Algoe
et al., 2013, for original description of this sample). Of these
conversations, 131 were possible to code for expresser beha-
vior (2 were not recorded due to procedural error; 13 more were
not coded due to poor sound quality). These individuals and
their partners are considered in the current analysis. Approxi-
mately half the couples were dating (55.1%) and the others
reported formal commitment through engagement, long-term
cohabitation, or marriage (44.9%); relationship length varied
from 7 to 423 months (M ¼ 48.67, median ¼ 25.00 months;
standard deviation [SD] ¼ 60.42); 61.8% of partners lived
together. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 57 (M ¼
27.91, SD ¼ 8.40), most self-identified as White/Caucasian
(77.1%) and non-Hispanic (96.9%). Sample size in the original
study was set with a goal of recruiting 80 couples (n ¼ 160);
here, it was determined by number of videos available for
coding.
In the lab, participants were asked to pick something their
partner had done for them recently, for which they felt grateful.
After each person selected the event and rated its importance,
one person was randomly chosen to speak first. After the con-
versation, they both rated their emotions and perceptions of
partner responsiveness before repeating with the other partner's
event; order was counterbalanced.
Measures
Self-report measures. Measures to be used in analyses completed
prior to the conversation include self-reported global relation-
ship satisfaction (Hendrick, 1988; 7 items, a ¼ .81), the
importance of the event for which the expresser felt grateful,
from 0 (not at all important) to 6 (extremely important), and the
target's self-reported general perception of expresser respon-
siveness in the relationship not tied to a specific instance of
behavior; instructions began, ``The statements below reflect
different aspects of your relationship.'' This 18-item scale was
an earlier version of one later reduced to 12 (Reis, Maniaci,
Caprariello, Eastwick, & Finkel, 2011; a ¼ .90). Immediately
after the conversation, the target of the expression rated the
extent to which the expresser was responsive within the social
``interaction here during this laboratory visit'' (Gable, Gon-
zaga, & Strachman, 2006; adapted from Reis, 2006; 10 items,
a ¼ .94). Targets also reported their positive emotions as a
result of the conversation by rating the following 11 items on
a scale ranging from 0 (not at all true/never true) to 6 (very
true/true all of the time): satisfied, loving, warm, appreciative,
admiring, peaceful, open, amused, grateful, proud, and
inspired. The average was computed to represent general pos-
itive emotions (a ¼ .89); to explore specificity, we targeted one
from theory: love.
Two targets provided extreme values that were more than
three SDs below the mean on perceived responsiveness and are
not included in analyses using this measure as the dependent
variable. See Supplemental Online Material (SOM) for results
of analyses that include these participants.1
Coding behavior within gratitude expressions. People expressed
thanks for everything from making banana pudding to being
there for the grateful partner through a hospital stay. The con-
versations contained many positively valenced statements by
the expressers. The behavioral coding systems developed for
this study, to identify statements within the expression of gra-
titude focused on praising the others' actions and statements
focused on benefits to the self, draw from emotion theory
(Algoe & Haidt, 2009; Ortony et al., 1988).
Two teams of four coders--one team for each behavior--
watched each video with sound. They rated the focal behavior
on a 5-point scale, ranging from 1 ¼ no or minor use of the
behavior to 5 ¼ excellent example or major use of the behavior.
More information about scale development and coder training
can be found in the OSM. Examples of other-praising state-
ments include, ``You know I'm a big flowers person,'' `` . . .
shows how responsible you are . . . ,'' ``You go out of your
way . . . ,'' and ``I feel like you're really good at that.'' Examples
of self-benefit statements include, ``It let me relax,'' ``It gave me
bragging rights at work,'' ``I can study and spend time with you
at the same time, which is great for me,'' and ``It makes me
happy.'' An average of the judges' scores is used for each beha-
vioral code for any given clip. Other-praising ratings ranged
from 1.25 to 5.00 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] ¼
.794); self-benefit ratings ranged from 1 to 5 (ICC ¼ .899).
Results
All regressions were run using multilevel models with person
(Level 1) nested within couple (Level 2) in the HLM software
660 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(7)
(Raudenbush, Byrk, Cheong, & Congdon, 1996). This
approach takes into account the fact that the couple members
are likely to be similar in their ratings on the dependent
measures.
Descriptive Information
Use of other-praising behavior was correlated positively within
couple, r[124] ¼ .41, p < .001, although use of self-benefit
behavior was not, r[129] ¼ .03, p > .250. See Table 1 for cor-
relations among all study variables. Notably, within person,
other-praising behavior was not correlated with self-benefit
behavior.
Primary Analyses
Conclusions from the correlations held in multilevel models
using either behavior to independently predict any of the three
dependent measures. As such, for brevity, we only display
results of the subsequent analysis: Table 2 shows that the
expresser's other-praising behavior continued to predict tar-
get's perception of expresser responsiveness, general positive
emotions, and the specific emotion of loving, even when con-
trolling for the expresser's self-benefit­focused behavior.
Addressing Alternative Explanations
Multilevel models including the predictors of expresser other-
praising and expresser focus on self-benefit, as well as either
conversation duration, expresser's indication of event impor-
tance, expresser or target relationship satisfaction, or target's
general perception of expresser responsiveness continued to
yield significant positive associations between expresser
other-praising behavior and the target's perception of expresser
responsiveness (ps < .02). Further, they did not reveal a sup-
pression effect for self-benefit focus (i.e., this negative coeffi-
cient did not reverse signs or become statistically significant,
ps > .096). The same pattern of effects held for the target's gen-
eral positive emotions and the specific emotion, loving (ps for
other praising < .04; ps for self-benefit > .250). These analyses

rule out many theoretically and practically derived alternative
explanations to the hypothesis that other-praising behavior is
the relationally active ingredient in expressions of gratitude,
spanning a range of levels of analysis, from additional behavior
(conversation duration) to global perceptions of either the
expresser (relationship satisfaction) or target (relationship
satisfaction or general perceptions of partner responsiveness)
and conversation-specific perceptions of the expresser (impor-
tance of the gratitude event). In Study 2, we also address
conversation-specific perceptions of the target.
Study 2
Study 1 demonstrated ample support for the hypothesis that
other-praising behavior is the relationally active ingredient in
expressions of gratitude: When expressers used more other-
praising behavior, their benefactors perceived them as more
responsive, benefactors felt good in general and more loving
in particular. In Study 2, we tested for conceptual replication.
To do so, we pooled two data sets that used the same in-lab pro-
cedure for the video recording and rating of an expressed gra-
titude conversation, this time with only one member of the
couple expressing. Although meta-analysis has garnered sup-
port in the literature (see Cummings, 2013), Curran and Hus-
song note that this approach is best when the original data
are unavailable (2009). With access to all available data, how-
ever, they suggest use of integrated data analysis, which is what
we do here.
Additionally, we ask the target about perceived positive
emotions of the expresser, which contributes in two ways. First,
although each behavioral code was defined as conveying pos-
itive emotion, there is not corroborating evidence to validate
this assumption. As such, we use correlations to test whether
targets perceive greater positive emotions when coders gave
higher ratings on each behavior. Second, one recent study pos-
ited that warmth conveyed by a thank you accounts for its
effects on the benefactor (Williams & Bartlett, 2015), and the
other-praising code (developed and implemented prior to that
publication) incorporates conveyed warmth. Here, we statisti-
cally account for the target's perception of warmth in the
expression, thereby testing whether the other-praising content
continues to account for unique variance in benefactor out-
comes, beyond the warmth it conveys.
Participants and Procedure
Heterosexual couples were recruited from the greater Chapel
Hill, NC, region for a study on ``everyday couple interactions.''
The couple must have been together for at least 1 year (see
OSM for additional information). Both members of 257 cou-
ples (n ¼ 514) attended this lab session together. Most couples
were dating exclusively (68.3%), with most others reporting a
formally committed relationship (31.4%); 54% were living
together. On average, participants were about 25 years old
(M ¼ 25.31, SD ¼ 8.11; range ¼ 18­73), predominantly Cau-
casian (70.6%) and non-Hispanic (90.8%).
Procedure for expressed gratitude task. A primary goal of these
study designs was to test the current hypothesis through experi-
mental manipulation. As such, only one randomly assigned
member of the couple expressed gratitude to the other in the
laboratory. However, the manipulation did not produce
changes in target perceptions of responsiveness, so we do not
consider it further here other than to control for condition in
statistical analyses (see OSM for more information regarding
the manipulation). Sample size for these studies originally was
determined with the goal of at least 60 couples in each of two
conditions to provide 78% power to detect a medium-sized
effect with an independent-samples t test at p < .05, two-
tailed. In Sample A, we ran additional couples in case of miss-
ing data; in Sample B, we ran additional couples to further
increase power; data collection ended when the grant period
ended. Critically, together in the lab room, the procedures were
the same as in Study 1. Prior to leaving the lab, couples were
debriefed about the nature of the experiment.
Measures
Self-report measures. As in Study 1, the expresser's and target's
initial measure of relationship satisfaction (a ¼ .88, .84, respec-
tively) and the target's initial measure of perceptions of general
responsiveness in the relationship (12 items; Reis et al., 2011;
a ¼ .94) were control variables in additional analyses as was
expresser's rated importance of the selected event. Again, the
target's postinteraction reported perceptions of expresser
responsiveness was the primary dependent measure (a ¼
.93), with general positive emotions (a ¼ .89) and the specific
emotion, loving, as secondary outcomes. In this study, targets
also rated their perception of the expresser's emotions during
and as a result of the interaction, using the same items and scale
as used for rating their own emotions. To test whether the tar-
gets picked up on the general positivity in each behavior
observed by the coders, the nine nongratitude items were
aggregated (a ¼ .84). One item--perceived warm feelings--
was used as an additional theoretically derived situation-
specific control variable.
Regarding the primary and secondary outcome measures,
six targets provided extreme values that were more than three
SDs below the mean on perceived responsiveness, four on gen-
eral positive emotions, and five for loving; they are not
included in analyses using the relevant measure as the depen-
dent variable. See OSM for results of analyses including these
participants. One rating of general positive emotions and lov-
ing as well as expresser responsiveness was not provided.
Behavioral coding. Other-praising behavior and self-benefit
behavior in the interactions were coded from the videos of the
conversation using the same definitions as in Study 1. In Sam-
ple A, across all expressers and averaged across four coders,
other-praising behavior ratings ranged from 1.25 to 5 (ICC ¼
.866); self-benefit behavioral ratings ranged from 1 to 4.5
(ICC ¼ .915). In Sample B, across all expressers, other-
praising behavior ratings averaged across four coders ranged
662 Social Psychological and Personality Science 7(7)
from 1.25 to 5 (ICC ¼ .864); self-benefit behavioral ratings
averaged across three coders ranged from 1 to 4.33 (ICC ¼
.841). Because the composition of coding teams differed in the
two samples, each behavioral variable was standardized within
study prior to pooling the data set.
Procedural errors. Due to technical and procedural errors in Sam-
ple A, information about condition instructions provided to
four expressers is missing; in one additional couple, both mem-
bers mistakenly heard the instructions intended for the expres-
ser. Because we control for condition in analyses, data from
these conversations were not included in the final sample. This
type of error did not exist for Sample B.
Results of Conceptual Replication Analyses
Descriptive information. See Table 3 for means, SDs, and corre-
lations among all variables as used. As in Study 1, although
most expressers engaged in both behaviors in the conversation,
expresser's use of other-praising behavior was uncorrelated
with use of self-benefit behavior.
Validation: Perceived expresser emotion. The correlations pre-
sented in Table 3 confirm that, consistent with the definition
of the codes as conveying positive emotions, targets were more
likely to perceive positive emotions in expressers with higher
scores on either behavioral code.
Primary analyses. As seen in Table 3, the basic correlation
between expresser other-praising behavior and target's percep-
tion of expresser responsiveness supports the primary study
hypothesis: Targets perceived greater expresser responsiveness
when the expresser used more praising behavior. In contrast,
there was no association between expresser use of self-
benefit behavior and the target's perception of expresser
responsiveness. The target's ratings of general positive
emotions and the specific experience of love showed similar
dissociated patterns, such that they were higher when the
expresser used more other-praising behavior but were not asso-
ciated with the expresser's use of self-benefit behavior.
Table 2 shows the results of three linear regression models,
one predicting each outcome of interest from expresser other-
praising behavior and self-benefit behavior simultaneously,
while controlling for study and condition. Conclusions do not
change from the correlational analyses.2
Addressing alternative explanations. We note that the correlation
between the target's perception of expresser warmth during the
conversation and expresser praising behavior as well as each
dependent measure is significant and positive. Nonetheless,
as with Study 1 analyses, controlling for conversation duration,
expresser or target satisfaction with the relationship, expres-
ser's rated importance of the gratitude event, target's general
perception of expresser responsiveness, or the target's percep-
tion of the expresser's warmth during the conversation in the
above model did not eliminate the statistically significant pos-
itive association between expresser other-praising behavior and
the target's perception of expresser responsiveness (ps .001)
nor did it reveal a suppression effect of self-benefit behavior
(ps > .14). The same was true for experienced positive emo-
tions and for the specific positive emotion of loving (ps for
other-praising < .04; ps for self-benefit > .13), with one excep-
tion, where the association between other-praising and target
positive emotions was reduced when controlling for perceived
expresser warmth (p ¼ .09).
Discussion
Data from three independent samples, totaling 370 naturalistic
conversations between romantic partners, point to the conclu-
sion that other-praising behavior is the relationally active ingre-

other-praising behavior, targets perceived them as more
responsive, targets felt better in general, and more loving in
particular. These are precisely the subjective psychological
experiences that theory and evidence suggest will forecast a
trajectory of growth for the benefactor and, likely, the relation-
ship (see Algoe, 2012; Algoe et al., 2013; Algoe & Zhaoyang,
2016; Fredrickson, 1998; Fredrickson et al., 2008; Gonzaga
et al., 2006; Reis et al., 2004).
Given the dyadic structure of the methods and the conserva-
tive inclusion of the additional positive expressive behavior,
the current work provides the first robust test of the hypothesis
that it is the other-praising feature of gratitude that makes it
uniquely suited for relationship promotion. These data contrib-
ute to the growing body of literature on the social consequences
of expressed positive emotion (Clark & Monin, 2014) and help
parse the theoretical and empirical landscape for understanding
the conditions under which certain positively valenced social
behaviors--here, an expression of gratitude--will be more
likely to produce certain types of social effects.
Although these are correlational data, the effects were
robust to several alternative explanations and consistent across
the two studies. This includes one variable identified in prior
research to be associated with a social outcome from expressed
gratitude, perceived warmth of the expresser (Williams & Bar-
tlett, 2015). This analysis is especially useful to consider given
that the behavioral code of other-praising explicitly mentions
conveyed ``warmth.'' Although of course each behavioral code
was derived from theory, wherein conveyed warmth would be
expected to covary with other praising, but not with self-benefit
expression (Ortony et al., 1988), we suspect that people expres-
sing self-benefit, compared to emotional neutrality or to
expressing negative emotions, typically would be seen as war-
mer by observers; they would also likely increase the target's
own positive emotions simply because it feels good to know
one did good (Dunn et al., 2008). Regardless of these potential
situations under which expressing one's own joy about a ben-
efit to the self could be a mechanism for beneficial social con-
sequences (and see Gable et al., 2006), in this very positive
context, with multiple sources of ``goodness,'' we did not find
it to be the distinguishing feature of expressed gratitude.
Instead, we used theory to separate the signal from the noise,
showcasing the unique relational value of other-praising beha-
vior. These findings justify future consideration of whether
other-praising behavior is the best signal of actually experi-
enced gratitude, using different methods.
Some readers may worry that observed other-praising beha-
vior is conceptually close to the primary outcome variable, per-
ceived expresser responsiveness. However, these are two
constructs from independent theoretical traditions (i.e., emo-
tions and relationships), operationalized with different descrip-
tions; although we assume that other-praising behavior taps
into the validation component of perceived responsiveness,
we do not view them as the same. Indeed, the correlations
between the two variables were modest (r ¼ .30 in Study 1 and
.25 in Study 2). Moreover, the secondary outcomes--the tar-
get's positive emotions--do not have conceptual overlap with
the predictor of expresser's other-praising behavior. Because
positive emotions are another path through which the target
may improve a sense of felt connection or feel rewarded from
the interaction with the expresser (see Aron, Norman, Aron,
McKenna, & Heyman, 2000) and loving in particular may
increase that person's willingness to invest in the relationship
(Gonzaga et al., 2006), these data provide useful convergent
evidence in support of the present hypothesis. Further, these
analyses draw attention to positive emotions as useful out-
comes to examine in future research within relationship
science.
Conclusion
The emotion of gratitude has been called out as central to social
life in general, and to survival in particular, by keeping one
embedded within a supportive social network (Algoe, 2012).
A critical contribution of that proposal is that a grateful person
enacts unique behaviors that could draw these high-quality,
supportive partners into the relationship. Here, we used theory
to identify one such behavior--other praising--that may pro-
vide that hook. The results drive home the point that other
praising is a theoretically and empirically overlooked, yet key
behavioral mechanism through which expressed gratitude can
impact the benefactor on precisely the outcome that has already
forecasted relational growth (i.e., target's perception of expres-
ser responsiveness) as well as others that should also do that,
even if indirectly (i.e., target's positive emotions and felt lov-
ing). With few exceptions, even when studied, most researchers
studying positive emotions or positively valenced interpersonal
processes do not have data from each member of the dyad nor
do they address cross-dyad questions that speak to the interper-
sonal process through which one person may influence the
other and rarely do they account for other positively valenced
content of the social interaction. As such, beyond contributions
to understanding the role of gratitude in social life, these find-
ings have implications for understanding mechanisms for the
growth of ongoing relationships and call for more research
on differential social consequences of expressed positive
emotions.

tion about Studies 1 and 2.
2. In each study, we also tested an interaction between the two beha-
viors on each outcome. From these six analyses, only one produced
a significant interaction; it was in this study on the outcome of per-
ceived expresser responsiveness. Exploration of simple slopes con-
tinues to support the hypothesis regarding other-praising behavior
but adds that, when praising is low, self-benefit behavior is posi-
tively associated with perceived expresser responsiveness (see
SOM for more information).
