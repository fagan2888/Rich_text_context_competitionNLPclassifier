Abstract. It is unclear how shadows are processed in the visual system. Whilst shadows are clearly
used as an important cue to localise the objects that cast them, there is mixed evidence regarding
the extent to which shadows influence the recognition of those objects. Furthermore experiments
exploring the perception of shadows per se have provided evidence that the visual system has less
efficient access to the detailed form of a region if it is interpreted as a shadow. The current study
sought to clarify our understanding of the manner in which shadows are represented by the visual
system by exploring how they influence attention in two different object-based attention paradigms.
The results provide evidence that cues to interpret a region as a shadow do not reduce the extent to
which that region will result in a within-`object' processing advantage. Thus, whilst there is evidence
that shadows are processed differently at higher stages of object perception, the present result shows
that they are still represented as distinctly segmented regions as far as the allocation of attention is
concerned. This result is consistent with the idea that object-based attention phenomena result from
region-based scene segmentation rather than from the representations of objects per se.
Keywords: objects, attention, vision, shadows, segmentation, shape.
1 Introduction
The pattern of stimulation that falls upon the retina is not equally informative. The limited
capacity of the visual system can be employed most effectively if it is focused on those
aspects of visual structure that most effectively enable us to recognise objects and to
act upon them. Shadows pose an interesting representational challenge in this context
because on the one hand, they do not represent inherent structure in the environment,
but on the other, they are potentially informative with respect to the objects that cast
them. Reviewing the status of shadows in the human visual system reveals a somewhat
mixed picture, in which inconsistencies in the pattern of illumination implied by shadows
are hard to identify (Ostrovsky et al 2005) and in some contexts have no measurable
influence on object recognition (Braje et al 2000; Bonfiglioli et al 2004), but in other contexts
shadows clearly aid and/or interfere with object recognition (Tarr et al 1998). Moreover,
the effect of illumination on the shading within an object clearly has a direct influence on
shape perception (Ramachandran 1988). Whilst shadows thus have a mixed role in object
recognition, they do seem to play an important role in computing the location (Imura et
al 2006; Yonas and Granrud 2006) and movement profile (Kersten et al 1996) of the objects
that cast them. Most critically for the current study, however, is evidence that access to the
visual form of a region is influenced by whether or not it can be interpreted as a shadow
(Rensink and Cavanagh 2004; Lovell et al 2009). This article seeks to build on the fact that the
interpretation of a region as a shadow can alter the accessibility of the form of that region
by testing whether cues that alter the interpretability of a region as a shadow influence the
allocation of attention to that region, using `object'-based attention paradigms.
Shadows, objects, and attention 151
The concept of an object is potentially controversial in the context of attention (see
Driver et al 2001 for an insightful critique of the use of the concept of an object in the
context of attention, a topic to which we will return in the Discussion); however, it is
generally acknowledged that some form of perceptual organisation influences the allocation
of attention (Scholl 2001). Furthermore this perceptual organisation that leads to the objects
selected by attention cannot be understood simply in terms of contrast boundaries; rather,
it is the manner in which those boundaries are interpreted that is critical (Anstis 1990;
Naber et al 2011; Albrecht et al 2008; Tadin et al 2002; Scholl et al 2001). A compelling
example of this (although not typically cited in the context of the object-based attention
literature) is provided by Anstis (1990), who shows that it is essentially impossible to track
the intersection between two lines when those lines appear to be two separately moving
items. The same physical intersection is, however, trivial to track when those lines can be
interpreted as moving together (as one, cross like, shape). More recently the role of higher
level perceptual organisation has been demonstrated in paradigms that exploit the `within-
vs-between object' advantage (cf Egly et al 1994). Classically, these paradigms demonstrate
that a target is more easily detected or discriminated when it is preceded by a cue or paired
with a comparison target within the same, rather than in a different, object. Albrecht et al
(2008) recently showed that whilst this within-vs-between object advantage was elicited by a
set of contrast boundaries forming a figure on top of a surface, the same contrast boundaries
would not elicit this effect when perceived as a `hole' cut into that surface. In another recent
example Naber et al (2011) exploited a bi-stable grouping stimulus (cf Lorenceau and Shiffrar
1992) to show that the facilitation effect seen in comparing two targets on the same object
is contingent not just on the sensory input but also on whether that input is perceptually
grouped or not. The fact that higher level factors in perceptual organisation can influence
the extent to which a set of closed contrast boundaries can be selected as a unit of attention
opens the question as to whether the interpretation of a given region as a shadow would
influence the extent to which that region could be selected by attention.
The idea that the same physical shape can be represented in a perceptually less salient
manner when interpreted as a shadow was suggested by work, mentioned above, by Rensink
and Cavanagh (2004). More specifically, Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) asked participants
to search for a target that had a different orientation to other items in a display. Rensink
and Cavanagh found that this visual search, or oddity detection, task was harder to perform
when the items in the display could be interpreted as shadows. The interpretability of the
stimuli as shadows was manipulated in a number of ways; one clearly effective method (also
employed in the current set of experiments) simply required the removal of the object that
cast the shadow.
To review, shadows have a rather mixed status in influencing different elements of
visual perception, they play a clear role in influencing the perception of the location of
the objects casting them, they play a more ambiguous role in aiding the recognition of
the objects that cast them, and of particular importance for the present study, there is
evidence that the interpretation of a region as a shadow appears to lead to that region
being processed differently. It is in this context that the current project set out to test the
status of shadows in two different object-based attention paradigms, in which cue-target
pairings (Egly et al 1994) and the comparison of two targets (Ben-Shahar et al 2007) are
facilitated when presented on the same object. Given previous evidence that the manner
in which a scene is organised will impact the extent to which regions of that scene will
show `within-object' advantages, this research seeks to exploit the techniques developed
by Rensink and Cavanagh for manipulating `shadow-hood' to ask whether the same region
152 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge
will be differentially selectable as a unit of attention when that region can or cannot be
interpreted as a shadow.
2 Experiment 1
2.1 Participants
Twenty-five participants were recruited in exchange for course credits. All participants were
first-year psychology undergraduates with normal or corrected to normal vision. Participants
were naive as to the aims of the study. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 38 (mean 20).
There were 8 males and 17 females.
2.2 Materials
The experiment was programmed in Borland C++, with the use of DirectX to ensure accurate
timings. Stimuli were constructed off-line before the experiment using the 3-D rendering
package `POV-Ray'. This programme uses accurate ray tracing in order to visualise the way in
which light will disperse in 3-D scenes, and thereby provides an optimal image-rendering
environment in which to generate veridical shadows. The stimuli were presented on 17 inch
PC monitors with a screen resolution of 1024 by 768 pixels.
2.3 Design
The experiment employed a 3 by 2 within-participants design. The first factor, Cue Type, had
three levels: valid (cue appears in same location as the target), invalid-within (cue appears at
a different location but on the same region), and invalid-between (cue appears at a different
location on a different region), as shown in Figure 1. There were equal numbers of each cue
type, and these were randomly distributed across trials. The second factor, Shadow Type, had
two levels: either the shaded regions could or could not be interpreted as shadows. In line
with Rensink and Cavanagh's (2004) study this was achieved by removing the objects that
cast the shadows. Shadow or Non-shadow-like stimuli were presented in separate blocks, the
order of which was counterbalanced across participants.
One of the critical factors in the original Egly et al (1994) paradigm pertains to the distance
between the cues and the targets. In order to establish the effect of objects upon attention,
it was critical to equate the distance between and within objects, such that any differences
could not be explained in spatial terms. The Egly et al result and the many replications
that have followed have clearly demonstrated that this influence of object structure upon
attention occurs in addition to that accounted for by the spatial distances between cues and
targets. The fact that our stimuli are rendered in a 3-D perspective (in order to enhance the
perception of our stimuli as shadows) complicates this aspect of control. This complication
arises because it is evident that attention is influenced by `size constancy' such that attention
operates in perceived rather than retinal space (Robertson and Kim 1999). It is therefore
more appropriate to align the distances between the stimuli in terms of the 3-D environment
rather than the 2-D distances that will hit the retina. Thus, whilst the distance between the
four cue/target locations was set to be equal in the reference frame of the coordinates of the
surface of the rendered environment, this resulted in unequal distances on the retinal image.
More specifically, the two horizontal distances are not identical on the screen (front = 7.0
deg, back = 4.4 deg) and the vertical distances between the target locations was 4 degrees of
visual angle. While highlighting this difference in visual angle, it should be borne in mind
that it was present in the Shadow and Non-Shadow conditions.
3 Procedure
Each participant completed two blocks of 32 practise trials and then 192 actual trials. Each
block contained equal numbers of valid, invalid-within, and invalid-between trials. On each

presented in the same location as the cue.
trial the participant would be presented with a cue for 250 ms. The cue was a small square
appearing in one of the four possible target locations. The use of this cue type was chosen
because Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) showed that contrast outlines around the edge of a
bounded region (like those typically used as cues in the Egly et al paradigm) can disrupt
the interpretation of that region as a shadow. After the cue there was a 200 ms gap before
the participants would be presented with one of two targets (an X or an N). The participant
simply had to report (using the X and N keys) which target had been presented. There was
then a 500 ms pause before the next trial started during which the scene remained visible.
The participant was not required to maintain fixation.
4 Results
The results were analysed using a two factor repeated measures ANOVA. The reaction time
data showed a clear effect of Cue Type (F(2,24) = 70.728, p < 0.0001). Comparing only the
within-vs-between object Cue Types yielded a significant difference (F(1,24) = 16.99, p <
0.001) reflecting that targets presented on the same object as the cue were detected more
rapidly. This within-vs-between object advantage did not interact with Shadow Type (F(1,24)
= 0.026, p = 0.874), and Shadow Type had no overall influence on the reaction time (F(1,24) =
0.164, p = 0.689).
The accuracy data revealed no significant main effect of Cue Type (F < 1), Shadow Type (F
< 1) or Cue x Shadow interaction (F(1,24) = 1.326, p = 0.261). The accuracies for the `valid',
`invalid within', and `invalid between' were 94.6%, 94%, and 95.1% for the non-shadow and
93.6%, 94%, and 94.6% for the shadow condition, and their associated standard errors were
0.89, 0.84, 0.64, 0.99, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively.

5 Interim discussion
The results of Experiment 1 revealed a clear replication of Egly et al's (1994) demonstration
of the influence of perceptual organisation upon attention, indicating that shadows are
represented by the visual system as `objects' in this context. That is, the results provide
no evidence that shadows are treated as less salient aspects of visual structure than other
bounded surfaces with respect to object-based attention. The Egly et al paradigm is, however,
just one of a range of tasks that can be employed to illustrate the influence of visual structure
upon attention (Duncan 1984; Driver and Baylis 1989; see Scholl 2001 for a review). Ben-
Shadar et al (2007) have, for instance, employed a two-item comparison task in which the
participant has to report whether two items (which can either be located on the same or
on different objects) are the same or different. They found that when briefly presented
targets were presented on different `objects', participants were less accurate in making such
judgements. Experiment 2 therefore seeks to explore whether the effects found in Experiment
1 with the Egly et al cuing paradigm will be replicated with this `divided attention' object-
based paradigm. Finally, because shadows come in numerous potential forms, a different
shadow type was used, to generalise the result to a shadow cast onto a different surface than
that to which the casting objects are attached (see Figure 3).

6.1 Participants
Thirty participants were recruited in exchange for payment or course credits. All participants
had normal or corrected to normal vision and were naive to the aims of the study. Participants'
ages ranged from 18 to 57 (mean 22: 29 of the participants were aged 18 to 27). There were 12
males and 18 females.

6.3 Design
The experiment employed a 2 by 2 within-participants design. The first factor, Object Type,
had two levels, within vs between object. On within-object trials the two to-be-compared
letters appeared on the same shape, whereas on between-object trials the two letters
appeared on different shapes. There were equal numbers of each level, and these were
randomly distributed across trials. The second factor, Shadow Type, had two levels: the
regions either could or could not be readily interpreted as shadows. In line with Rensink and
Cavanagh (2004), this was achieved by removing the objects that cast the shadows. In contrast
to Experiment 1, however, the shadows were cast from an object to which they were not
attached, and the light source for the scene was visible (see Figure 3). In the non-shadow-like
condition, in addition to the removal of the objects responsible for casting the shadow, all
other shadows in the scene were removed, to further reduce the likelihood of the shapes on
which the targets were presented being interpreted as shadows. Shadow or non-shadow-like
stimuli were presented in separate blocks, the order of which was counterbalanced across
participants.
In the context of previous data highlighting that attention moves in perceived rather than
retinal space (Robertson and Kim 1999) we were again faced with the problem of how to
control for the spatial separation between the targets. In Experiment Two a more stringent
criterion was adopted such that the within-object distances were longer than the between-
object distances. Given the potential ambiguity over how to control for the distance in these
3-D displays, this change ensured that both in retinal and perceived spatial distance the
within-object distances were in fact further apart, thus tending to reduce any object-based
advantage. The vertical (within object) separation between the targets was therefore fixed at
5.75 degrees whilst the horizontal distances were 3.8 degrees at the top and 4.9 degrees at the
bottom.

6.4 Procedure
Each participant completed two blocks with 4 practise trials and then 192 actual trials.
Each block contained equal numbers of within- and between-object trials. On each trial
the participant would be presented with two letters (`X X', `N X', or `N N') that could either
both be the same or different. The participant had to report as quickly and accurately as
possible whether the letters were the same or different by pressing the `S' key if they were
the same and the `K' key if they were different. The two letters would either both be on the
same or on different shaded regions. Participants maintained fixation on a small white dot
in the centre of the display. There was a 500 ms gap between trials, during which the scene
remained visible.
6.5 Results
A 2 by 2 repeated measures ANOVA on the accuracy data revealed a significant effect of
Object Type (F(1,29) = 4.56, p = 0.041).(1) Object Type, however, did not interact with Shadow
Type (F = 0.851). There was also no effect of Shadow Type on the accuracy data (F < 1). The
Reaction Time data revealed no significant effects, (Shadow Type, F < 1; Object Type, F < 1).
The Shadow Type x Object Type reaction time interaction (F (1,29) = 1.037, p = 0.317) was not
only non-significant but in fact showed a trend in the opposite direction to that expected if
shadows were ignored. The reaction times in the within and between conditions were 609
ms and 601 ms in the non-shadow and 604 ms and 605 ms in the shadow condition; their
associated standard errors were 15 ms, 15 ms, 16 ms, and 14ms, respectively.

casting objects (shadows) or without casting objects (non-shadows).
(1) It is apparent that the magnitude of the accuracy difference reported here is smaller than that
previously reported. For instance Ben-Shahar et al (2007, Experiment 1) found effect sizes in the order
of 3Â­4%, whereas the difference across the two conditions here is only 1.15%. This difference could
have been caused by three factors. First, the `objects' used here are fuzzy and semi-transparent with
the background. Second, the spatial distances within the objects were made larger than those between
objects to ensure that any within-vs-between differences definitely reflected object-based effects.
Third, the targets in Ben-Shahar et al were presented for very brief periods of time, followed by a mask,
leading to much lower accuracies in general (86Â­76%, depending on their condition). This added
difficulty in processing the targets may well bring into clearer light the advantages accruing to target
pairings on the same objects and explain why the effect size here is so much smaller. A post-target
mask was not employed here simply because it is uncertain how this might affect the interpretation of
the regions as shadows.
Shadows, objects, and attention 157
6.6 Discussion
The representational status of shadows was explored using two object-based attention
paradigms. The results provide consistent evidence that increasing the extent to which a
region could be interpreted as a shadow had no effect on the extent to which that region
could be selected as an `object' of attention. This study was motivated by the mixed picture
regarding the role of shadows, which are often actively utilized, in the visual system in the
context of localising the objects that cast them but play a somewhat ambiguous role in
influencing the recognition of the objects casting them. More specifically, this study was
motivated by visual search data highlighting that access to form information is less efficient
when that form can be interpreted as a shadow (Rensink and Cavanagh 2004).
At first glance the current result and that of Rensink and Cavanagh (2004) could appear in
contradiction--in that whilst their result suggests that shadows have a lower representational
status within the visual system, the current result suggests that the interpretation of a
stimulus as a shadow does not influence the preferential allocation of attention within
that region. These two findings may, however, tap very different levels of representation. It
may be that shadows have to be segmented as distinct regions of space at the early level at
which within-vs-between object advantages operate, in order that visual form discrimination
mechanisms can then tag what should be `discounted' from further processing.
The possibility that shadows are accessible as units of attentional selection exactly
because their differential status requires that they have to be segmented as distinct areas of
space is also consistent with Lovell et al's (2009) argument that shadows are not `discounted'
per se but rather that shadows are represented at distinct coarse spatial scale. Lovell et
al's interpretation is based on the fact that although they could replicate Rensink and
Cavanagh's finding of less efficient visual search for an `odd one out' shadow when the
difference between this and the other shadows was more subtle, they actually found more
rapid visual search performance for stimuli interpretable as shadows when the difference
was larger (for example, a 90 degree, rather than just a 30 degree, difference in orientation).
Lovell et al argue that visual search is faster for shadows with large differences because they
are rapidly identified and segmented but that less efficient search occurs for more subtle
discriminations because the tagging of an area as a shadow results in it being represented in
a coarse manner.
If shadows can influence attention but are represented in a distinct manner to other
objects (either in terms of an active `discounting' or being represented at a coarser spatial
scale), then this clearly returns us to the question of whether it is appropriate to talk
about `object'-based attention effects. This issue was raised most clearly by Jon Driver
and colleagues more than 10 years ago (Driver et al 2001) when they argued that so called
object-based attention phenomena in fact reflected the influence of segmentation upon
attention rather than an influence of objects per se. This distinction (between segmentation
and objecthood) itself, however, raises the question of how exactly the segmentation and
grouping of sensory input can be defined and understood separately from the construction
and recognition of objects. Without attempting to answer this question in full, the current
result does potentially offer an illustrative example regarding how this distinction could
become manifest. To reiterate, whilst regions identified as shadows do not seem to have the
same representational status as other objects (cf Rensink and Cavanagh 2004; Lovell et al
2009), they seem to nevertheless remain segmented as distinct regions such that within-vs-
between `object' attentional effects are still evident. A final important fact to keep in mind
is that the two object-based attention paradigms used here do not cover the full range of
paradigms operationalized as measures of object-based attention. Multiple object tracking
is an important case in point, and it remains an open question in general whether these
158 L de-Wit, D Milner, R Kentridge
different object-based phenomena actually reflect a common form of attentional selection,
and whether this selection operates upon the same objects.
