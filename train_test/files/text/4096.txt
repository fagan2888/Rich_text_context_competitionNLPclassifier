Asthma affects 7.1 million children in the United
States, disproportionately burdening African American
and Latino children. Barriers to asthma control include
insufficient patient education and fragmented care.
Care coordination represents a compelling approach to
improve quality of care and address disparities in
asthma. The sites of The Merck Childhood Asthma
Network Care Coordination Programs implemented differ-
ent models of care coordination to suit specific settings--
school district, clinic or health care system, and
community--and organizational structures. A variety
of qualitative data sources were analyzed to determine
the role setting played in the manifestation of care
coordination at each site. There were inherent strengths
and challenges of implementing care coordination in
each of the settings, and each site used unique strate-
gies to deliver their programs. The relationship between
the lead implementing unit and entities that provided
(1) access to the priority population and (2) clinical
services to program participants played a critical role
in the structure of the programs. The level of support
and infrastructure provided by these entities to the lead
implementing unit influenced how participants were
identified and how asthma care coordinators were inte-
grated into the clinical care team.

>Introduction
Asthma affects 7.1 million children (9.5%) in the
United States and is a leading cause of school absences
and activity limitations (Akinbami, Moorman, & Liu,
2011; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2013; Moorman et al., 2012). Non-Hispanic Black (16%)
and Hispanic children (10%) are more likely to have
asthma than non-Hispanic White children (8%). Race/
ethnicity-based disparities in health care utilization for
asthma are marked, with more frequent emergency
department (ED) visits or hospitalizations among
African American and Hispanic children compared to
White children (Akinbami et al., 2011; Ginde, Espinola,
& Camargo, 2008). Barriers to asthma control include
insufficient patient education (Holsey, Collins, &
Zahran, 2013; Oraka, Iqbal, Flanders, Brinker, & Garbe,
2013), fragmented care and lack of coordination
between clinic and community services (Butz, Kub,
Bellin, & Frick, 2013; Krieger et al., 2006), psychosocial
stressors (Koinis-Mitchell, Kopel, Salcedo, McCue, &
McQuaid, 2014; Wright et al., 2004), perceived finan-
cial burden (Patel, Brown, & Clark, 2013), and home
triggers such as tobacco smoke exposure, mold, pests,
and dust (Crain et al., 2002; Everhart et al., 2011). Care
coordination for asthma is one comprehensive strategy
to address these barriers. Care coordination is
a client-centered, assessment-based interdiscipli-
nary approach to integrating health care and social
support services in which an individual's needs
and preferences are assessed, a comprehensive care
plan is developed, and services are managed and
monitored by a care coordinator following evi-
dence-based standards of care. (Brown, 2009, p. 1)
Care coordination engages multiple stakeholders, such
as family members, health care providers, social ser-
vices, schools, and community organizations
(Bodenheimer, 2008). Care coordination has been
shown to reduce asthma symptoms, unscheduled
health care use, activity limitations, and school
absences, among other positive outcomes (Clark et al.,
2010; Clark et al., 2013; Coughey et al., 2010; Mansfield
et al., 2011; Thyne, Rising, Legion, & Love, 2006).
The Merck Childhood Asthma Network Care
Coordination Programs
The Merck Childhood Asthma Network (MCAN)
Care Coordination Programs, Phases 1 and 2, aimed to
reduce pediatric asthma morbidity in vulnerable popula-
tions. In Phase 1, five sites implemented evidence-based
interventions (EBIs) to improve outcomes and explore
the factors that led to successful adoption of EBIs in
urban settings (Viswanathan et al., 2011). These interven-
tions yielded improvements in symptoms, hospital and
ED use, school absences, and caregiver confidence
(Banda et al., 2013; Lara et al., 2011; Lara et al., 2013;
Mansfield et al., 2011; Turyk et al., 2013). Whereas not all
work in Phase 1 focused on care coordination, in a sec-
ond phase, the four sites selected to continue empha-
sized care coordination activities. Phase 2 sites are the
school-based Los Angeles Unified School District Asthma
Program (Los Angeles, California), the health system­
based Children's Hospital of Philadelphia Asthma Care
Navigator Program (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), the
Federally Qualified Health Center­based (FQHC) La Red
de Asma Infantil de Puerto Rico (San Juan, Puerto Rico),
and the community-based Addressing Asthma in
Englewood Project (Chicago, Illinois). Due to its care
coordination focus, the relative strength of its evidence
base, and its success with similar vulnerable popula-
tions, all sites chose to adapt the EBI Yes We Can, a
medical-social model of care that deploys health workers
(referred to as asthma care coordinators [ACCs] for the
purposes of this article) to provide asthma education,
link families to health and social services, and facilitate
communication between the patient and clinicians
(Thyne et al., 2006; Thyne & Fisher-Owens, 2011; Thyne,
Marmor, Madden, & Herrick, 2007).
Variation across Phase 2 sites provides a unique
opportunity to examine the strengths and challenges of
implementing asthma care coordination in different
institutional and organizational settings. The effect set-
ting has on the manifestation of care coordination for
pediatric asthma has not been well documented in the
literature. The goal of this article is to use qualitative
implementation data to assess (1) the influence of these
settings on the structure of care coordination activities,
(2) the strengths of implementing care coordination for
asthma in a given setting, and (3) the primary chal-
lenges that arise. This investigation contributes to the
knowledge base on effective models of asthma care
coordination across a range of settings, and findings can
be used to inform program planning, reimbursement or
other funding decisions, and future research priorities.

>Method
Data Sources
Members of the University of Michigan cross-site
evaluation team used multiple qualitative data sources
in the analysis (Table 1): annual site report forms that
tracked program components, reach, partnerships, and
Kelly et al. / CARE COORDINATION FOR CHILDHOOD ASTHMA 869
efforts to effect system and policy change; notes of key
informant interviews (verified by audio recordings) with
program leaders and ACCs; minutes from quarterly con-
ference calls with sites; and site-completed surveys
regarding their perspectives on the influence of the site's
setting on care coordination (there was a 100% response
rate from the sites with respect to these data sources).
Analysis
To guide data collection and analysis, the cross-site
evaluation used the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness,
Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) framework
(Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999) as well as the factors
affecting implementation that were identified by Durlak
and DuPre (2008), which include those related to set-
ting such as organizational capacity. While collecting
data from the sites over time, the researchers induc-
tively uncovered the concept (which later became the
study hypothesis) that the type of setting in which a
care coordination program takes place influences how
it carries out key functions, representing a form of
grounded theory generated from the qualitative data
(Patton, 2002). As a preliminary step, researchers read
through notes and other data sources and constructed
narrative summaries identifying each site's program
activities and sequence. A leader from each MCAN site
reviewed the summary for accuracy. Researchers then
compared the verified narrative summaries to identify
commonalities and differences across sites.
Next, two members of the cross-site evaluation team
conducted an inductive theme analysis (Patton, 2002),
based on a review of sources listed in Table 1 (with the
exception of the Settings Survey), to identify strengths
and challenges associated with the care coordination
structure in each of the four sites. The researchers used
a priori definitions of strengths (i.e., things inherent in
a particular structure/setting that facilitated delivery of
care coordination services) and challenges (things
inherent in a structure/setting that hindered services).
Next, strengths/challenges were categorized by dimen-
sions of the care coordination process that emerged
from the analysis. Consensus meetings were held with
a third researcher to reach agreement regarding both the
strengths/challenges and the categorization scheme. As
a preliminary step for validating these categories (Miles

& Huberman, 1994), we asked site leaders to complete a
brief, open-ended survey on the categories and collect
any further relevant site perspectives on the topic. Their
responses confirmed the categorization, and a few new
perspectives were added to the initial findings. As a

>Results
Care Coordination Activities Common to All Sites
As an initial step in examining how setting influ-
enced the structure of care coordination, an analysis of
narrative summaries was conducted to determine the
similarities and differences in care coordination activi-
ties. The comparison revealed a common set of activities
across sites, including asthma education, a home assess-
ment, and follow-up calls or visits (Table 2). The
sequence varies from site to site, and each program
allows for flexibility in their care pathway; for example,
an ACC may make additional calls between home visits
to a high-need family.
Defining "Settings"
While analyzing the narrative summaries, it became
clear that the functional relationships of the lead
implementing unit (LIU) to key partners needed to be
accounted for in the definition of "settings." For this

analysis, LIU was defined as the group of individuals
leading the design and implementation of the program.
In all four sites, each LIU consists of a project director,
manager, and the ACCs, all employed by the institution
that is the fiduciary of the grant. Two types of partners
played a critical role in how care coordination is struc-
tured: those that (1) provide access to the priority
population and (2) provide clinical services to program
participants. The ability of the LIU to identify partici-
pants, exchange information about participants, and
integrate ACCs into clinical practice hinges on the sup-
port of these partners. Table 3 describes each site's LIU,
priority population, as well as the LIU's relationship to
partners for access and clinical care.
Two broad categories emerged in how setting, as
defined above, influences care coordination: (1) identifi-
cation of participants and (2) the integration of ACCs with
the clinical care team. Substantial differences in these
two categories exist across sites. The strengths and chal-
lenges observed in each setting, according to these catego-
ries, are described below and summarized in Table 4.
Identification of Participants
Los Angeles: School-Based Participant Identifica-
tion.Enrollees are children with poor asthma control
who reside in Los Angeles Unified School District bound-
aries. The ACCs are school nurses who specialize in
asthma. They receive referrals from the district's nearly
500 school nurses and school administrators, teachers,
attendance counselors, parents, and clinicians at the part-
ner clinics, including a mobile asthma van program
(Breathmobiles). Each ACC works with the Los Angeles
Unified School District's nurses in a defined geographic
region. The program provides comprehensive training for
school nurses, which includes assessment of asthma con-
trol, and school nurses use a standardized process to refer
students with poor control to the program.

Table 4 (continued)
Identifying and helping children through a school
system has several advantages. For many low-income
families, schools are a primary connection with health
and social services; therefore they are often receptive to
program services. A program is able to reach students
at school, in a safe and convenient environment, and
students with poor asthma control can be identified
based on staff observation, attendance records, and
academic performance. However, while an ACC can
easily reach students, reaching parents can be more dif-
ficult, and the program requires parental consent and
participation. ACCs thus may educate students and
parents in separate appointments (e.g., one at school,
one at home).
Philadelphia: Health System­Based Participant Identi-
fication.The program in the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia's system identifies high-risk patients
through review of asthma inpatient and ED report and
electronic medical records (EMRs) of children seen in
primary care centers, and physician referrals.
EMR access is a significant advantage of working
from within the health system. The combination of
using EMR data to identify eligible participants and
the recruitment efforts of ACCs, who are, importantly,
staff members within the primary care clinic of poten-
tial participants, is particularly advantageous. In con-
trast to programs that rely on primary care provider
(PCP) records or referrals, the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia's program is able to identify serious
cases that might otherwise go unnoticed if the family
does not schedule a follow-up visit with their PCP
after an ED visit or hospitalization. Additionally,
access to EMRs allows the program to easily identify
those who meet enrollment criteria. While participa-
tion is restricted to patients in the health system, the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's reach in the
area is extensive. Furthermore, the model is replicable
874 HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICE / November 2015
and will likely appeal to future Accountable Care
Organizations.
San Juan: Clinic-Based Participant Identification. In San
Juan, program success depends on the partnership
between the researchers and HealthproMed administra-
tion and clinicians, and their capacity to partner with
local community leaders and agencies for outreach and
recruitment. Project staff identifies eligible children by
screening potentially eligible families in the clinic's wait-
ing rooms. These efforts are supplemented by outreach
strategies in collaboration with HealthproMed's Commu-
nity Advisory Board and staff, who identify potential
patients based on secondary claims data. Potential par-
ticipants are invited to the clinic in order to be screened
and consented.
Because HealthproMed is the only FQHC in San
Juan, the potential catchment area is geographically
large. Access to claims data allows HealthproMed to
identify high ED and hospital users. Finally, children
coming in to the clinic with exacerbation of symptoms
are a "captive" population that is likely to be eligible.
However, only clinic patients can be screened and
enrolled in the program.
Chicago: Community-Based Participant Identifica-
tion. The priority population in Chicago is a geographi-
cally defined community on the south side. The ACC
recruits families at clinics and community events; par-
ticipants are also referred by physicians, schools, com-
munity-based organizations, and word of mouth. One
benefit of this approach is that Chicago is able to reach
a broad population within a specific community and is
not limited to the population of one institution. This
approach also allows Chicago to reach children not
actively engaged with health care through relationships
with community members and organizations. Unlike
the other programs that only enroll children with poorly
controlled persistent asthma, the Chicago program also
serves children with intermittent asthma, as (1) com-
munity leaders made clear that denying access to chil-
dren with less severe diagnoses would not be acceptable
to the community and (2) information about asthma
control is not always readily available or consistent
across the priority population.
To reach a geographically defined population, rather
than one served by an institution, demands a great deal
of resources to nurture relationships with the diverse
referral sources needed to identify eligible children.
Additionally, demonstrating the program's value to
multiple organizations may be more challenging than
when programs are embedded within a single institu-
tion, where established feedback channels to internal
referral sources, such as school nurses and PCPs, dem-
onstrate the program's positive impacts. However, by
creating and strengthening relationships with other
community organizations and institutions, Chicago
was able overcome these barriers and link families with
other needed services in the community.
Integration of ACCs
Integration of ACCs into the clinical care team is the
second major difference among care coordination sites.
"Integration" represents the acceptance of the ACC role
by the health care team, incorporation of ACC into the
clinic's workflow when possible, communication
between ACCs and health care providers, and sharing
of resources with the ACC to facilitate care coordina-
tion. Integration of the ACC is an essential element of
MCAN's Care Coordination Programs. Care coordina-
tion by the MCAN programs relies on the ACC to pro-
vide the link between care delivered outside and inside
of the health care office. Limited integration restricts
the level of coordination possible.
Los Angeles: School-Based Integration.ACCs and other
school nurses communicate with each other through the
electronic student health record (e.g., with notes on the
completion of program components, results of assess-
ments, supplies and medications provided, and prompts
for follow-up). However, due to the separation between
the school system and external health care providers,
integration with clinical providers is not standardized.
Students enrolled in Los Angeles' program receive care
from the Breathmobile or their own private provider. The
ACCs provide updates to clinicians during the Breathmo-
bile's visits to the participants' schools, and Breathmobile
clinicians update ACCs on patient visits, health status,
and requests for follow-up from the ACC. Breathmobile
clinicians complete an asthma action plan (AAP) for each
child that is shared with the ACC. Formal meetings
between the ACCs and the Breathmobile clinical team
occur every 2 to 3 months in order to discuss program
coordination issues. For other providers, communication
is not as regular or direct. For example, the ACCs ask par-
ents to deliver uncompleted AAPs to be filled out by the
provider. In both cases, sharing of protected personal
information is limited by the Family Educational Rights
and Privacy Act and the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act restrictions as well as the strength of
relationships between the program and clinicians.
Philadelphia: Health System­Based Integration.Phil-
adelphia, as a result of being embedded within the
same institution providing clinical services, has been
Kelly et al. / CARE COORDINATION FOR CHILDHOOD ASTHMA 875
able to more fully integrate ACCs into a team of health
care providers and to influence clinical encounters, for
example, physician adherence to national guidelines
for asthma diagnosis and management (National Heart,
Lung, and Blood Institute, 2007). To facilitate regular
ACC­provider information exchange, health system
policies were changed to allow ACCs to view EMR
snapshots and enter notes on asthma symptoms, envi-
ronmental findings from home visits, psychosocial bar-
riers, and referrals to community services. Providers
can also send requests via the EMR for ACCs to encour-
age a family to schedule follow-up visits. In addition,
ACCs attend clinical staff meetings to address difficult
cases and other issues. This two-way information flow
facilitated the acceptance of ACCs as valued members
of the clinical team. The initial barrier to smooth clini-
cal integration of ACCs was their potential for inter-
rupting clinic workflow, but they have learned optimal
times to engage the family during clinical visits.
San Juan: Clinic-Based Integration. San Juan's program
is composed of a partnership between a local research
institution, local community leaders and agencies, and
an FQHC. The ability to integrate ACCs depends on the
access and clinical collaboration provided by the FQHC
and the practical constraints within a busy general
pediatric clinic. The first educational session generally
takes place in the clinic immediately following a visit.
The ACC works with the family to create an AAP, and
the AAP is later entered into a specially created tem-
plate of the EMR for the PCP to confirm and discuss
with the family at the next encounter. By holding the
educational session immediately following a clinical
encounter, patients and caregivers come to the session
engaged on the topic of the patient's health, and ACCs
are able to reinforce or clarify points discussed between
the patient and the clinician. When it is not possible to
schedule a clinical visit immediately prior to the first
educational session, the ACCs work with clinic staff to
promote communication among the family, clinician,
and ACC. Additionally, ACCs communicate directly
with clinicians, including the clinic's social worker, to
address issues that emerge, and the educational session
is documented in the patient's EMR.
Chicago: Community-Based Integration. Like San Juan,
the program in Chicago is led by an academic team with
a history of community-focused work. Due to the lack of
a central health care facility in Englewood, Chicago
developed partnerships with multiple providers. The
levels of infrastructure and support at each location
vary, which requires flexibility of the ACCs with regard
to implementation. While recruitment and education
sometimes take place in the clinic, most activities are
implemented in participants' homes and over the tele-
phone. As a result of not being fully embedded within
the institutions providing care, Chicago's program has
limited ability to exchange information with clinical
staff. ACCs encourage clinicians to give completed
AAPs to the participants, but success varies by provider.
ACCs send the providers written notification of patient
participation in the program and completion; this may
serve as a prompt for the provider to continue commu-
nication regarding management of the child's asthma.

>Discussion
Strengths and challenges for the implementation of
care coordination programs are evident in the settings
of the four MCAN sites. In addition to attributes inher-
ent in particular settings, a key consideration is the
relationship between the LIU and the key access and
clinical partners. This relationship, including whether
or not the LIU is embedded in the institutions provid-
ing access and clinical services, influences the pro-
gram's reach and the extent to which ACCs are
integrated in a clinical care team.
Each site employed unique strategies to identify eli-
gible participants based on feasibility and acceptability
for key access partners. By leveraging the internal
sources of information within the Children's Hospital of
Philadelphia, for example, Philadelphia has been able
to identify cases through health care utilization data
found in EMRs. This approach has the potential to
reach eligible individuals who are not using primary
care services. Similarly, Los Angeles uses internal
records on school absences and nurse visits to identify
potential enrollees. Those types of data sources were
unavailable to Chicago due to limitations in infrastruc-
ture and privacy restrictions. Instead, Chicago relied on
direct contact with participants and referrals from clini-
cians and community organizations. Clinician referrals
engage patients who are already actively involved in
managing their health; this may facilitate engagement
overall, but the physician referral approach may miss
those who have barriers to accessing care. In the case of
referrals from trusted community organizations or
schools, this approach lends credibility in vulnerable
communities that have had negative experiences with
interventions led with minimal community input or
reciprocity (Yancey, Ortega, & Kumanyika, 2006). In San
Juan, in addition to recruiting directly from clinic wait-
ing rooms and clinician referrals, other outreach strate-
gies and data sources were used to encourage patients
to come to the clinic to be screened. A potential limita-
tion of the recruitment taking place exclusively within
876 HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICE / November 2015
a given institution is the restriction of reach to the
population served by that institution, whereas recruit-
ment through multiple channels expands reaches to a
broader population.
Integration with the care team can be limited for
sites that do not offer clinical care directly through the
lead implementing institution. For example, although
Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Juan have core clinical
partners, they are limited by the access, support, and
resources those providers are willing and able to grant
an external entity. Philadelphia, in contrast, was able to
integrate clinical care components to a greater extent.
The program's position within the care-providing insti-
tution, including the ACCs' status as employees of the
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, facilitated the
exchange of information between members of the clini-
cal care team and ACCs. That is not to say that care
coordination programs cannot be led by institutions
outside of the clinical setting. Indeed, coordination can
be greatly enhanced by the strength of the partnerships,
the level of integration with partnering clinics, and
clinic-provided resources to the care coordination pro-
gram. For example, in Puerto Rico, the strong partner-
ships and in-kind support of the program by the FHQC
have been essential for the successful implementation
of the program and promotion of sustainability.
Additionally, the ability to integrate with the care team
in an institution is not always a function of institu-
tional policy; often the sense of mission and belief in
the initiative from key individuals responsible for the
implementation of care coordination components, such
as clinicians, limit the level of integration achievable.
A limitation of this study is that the strengths and
challenges described are limited to the perspectives of
the leaders and program coordinators at each site. While
not all of the findings described in this article may be
generalizable to other similar settings (as resources,
infrastructure, and other contextual factors can vary
both across and within settings), this article describes
key factors that should be considered when developing
or implementing care coordination initiatives. At the
time of this analysis, health outcome data were not yet
available, and the sustainability of these programs
beyond grant funding is yet to be determined.
Furthermore, while it would have been beneficial to
examine issues such as recruitment efficiency and costs
of implementing care coordination in different settings,
those data were not available from all of the MCAN sites.

>Conclusions
The purpose of this article was to explore the influence
setting has on care coordination for childhood asthma and
to document the strengths and challenges inherent to each
of four settings in which such work is likely to take place
(school district, health care system, clinic, and commu-
nity). While at a high level, care coordination across these
settings could be described as somewhat similar, factors
such as the ability to use data sources, leverage infrastruc-
ture, readily communicate with health care providers, and
integrate new components of care into practice played a
key role in instituting improvements in coordinated care.
The analysis also uncovered the importance of the LIU's
organizational relationships to partners providing access
to participants and clinical care. Regardless of setting, suc-
cessful program implementation requires considerable
resources, time, and buy-in from key stakeholders. Future
research is needed to examine how setting influences the
family's level of engagement, the effects of different care
coordination models have on health and health care utili-
zation, and, importantly, the characteristics of care coordi-
nation models that facilitate or impede their sustainability.
While these topics are critical in demonstrating to stake-
holders the value of implementing and sustaining coordi-
nated care, more translational research and development
of standardized evaluation tools are needed to facilitate
adoption and evaluation of evidence-based programs in
different settings.
