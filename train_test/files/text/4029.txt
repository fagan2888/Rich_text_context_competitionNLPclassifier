polycystic kidney disease
Jian-Qing Wang1, Fu Qin2 and Liang Zhu3
Abstract
Objective: To explore the role of Naþ/Hþ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) in
autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).
Methods: NHERF1 and b-catenin protein were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western
blotting of kidney tissue samples from patients with ADPKD and controls (normal kidney tissue
[>5 cm from the foci] collected from patients undergoing unilateral nephrectomy for kidney
cancer). NHERF1 and b-catenin protein and mRNA were quantified by Western blot and real-time
fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively, in kidney tissue samples from
Han:SPRD (þ/þ) and (cy/þ) rats. The effects of human recombinant NHERF1 on proliferation and
cell cycle of ADPKD cyst-lining epithelial cells (WT9­12) were evaluated by MTT assay and flow
cytometry, respectively.
Results: Levels of NHERF1 protein and mRNA were significantly lower, and b-catenin levels
significantly higher, in patients with ADPKD and Han:SPRD (cy/þ) rats, compared with control
subjects and (þ/þ) rats, respectively. Exogenous recombinant NHERF1 significantly inhibited
proliferation of WT9­12 cells and increased the proportion of cells in G0
/G1
phase.
Conclusions: ADPKD is associated with a decrease in NHERF1 protein and mRNA levels.
Supplementing exogenous NHERF1 inhibited the proliferation of WT9­12 cells.

may therefore be associated with kidney
tumour development.2
Cyst-forming signalling pathways include
Wnt/b-catenin, which is involved in cell
proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and
adhesion in tumour cells.3 Since this path-
way also controls kidney development and
maintenance of normal morphology and
function, disturbance can lead to disorders
such as polycystic kidney disease.4
Abnormal activation of the Wnt/b-catenin
signalling pathway plays a critical role in
ADPKD onset.5,6 Naþ/Hþ exchanger regu-
latory factor 1 (NHERF1) regulates signal-
ling molecules (including b-catenin) via
phosphorylation,7 and is highly expressed
and abnormally located in many types of
tumour cells.8­11
The aim of the present study was to
quantify NHERF1 and b-catenin in kidney
tissue samples from patients with ADPKD
and normal kidney tissue samples from
control subjects, and a rat ADPKD model
(Han:SPRD). In addition, the effects of
recombinant human NHERF1 protein on
the proliferation and apoptosis of an
ADPKD cyst-lining epithelial cell line were
evaluated.
Materials and methods
Study population
The study recruited patients with ADPKD
who underwent unilateral nephrectomy due
to cyst bleeding or pelvic pressure at the
Department of Nephrology, Second
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University,
Hangzhou, China, between January 2011
and December 2013. Control samples of
kidney tissue were provided by patients
undergoing unilateral nephrectomy for
kidney carcinoma at the same institution:
normal kidney tissue samples (>5 cm from
the foci) were collected from each control
subject.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital
of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China,
and all participants provided written
informed consent.
Animals
Male Han:SPRD rats (30 heterozygous [cy/
þ] and 30 normal [þ/þ] animals) were
purchased from Mayo Clinic (Rochester,
MN, USA) and bred in the Experimental
Animal Centre, Second Affiliated Hospital
of Zhejiang University. Experiments were
performed using groups of six rats aged 4, 8,
12, 16 or 24 weeks. Animal welfare and
experimental procedures were conducted
strictly in accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
(US National Research Council, 1996) and
the related ethics regulations of the Second
Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University.
Immunohistochemistry
Human kidney tissue samples from
ADPKD patients and controls were fixed
in 100 ml/l neutral formaldehyde solution
for 24 h, dehydrated, paraffin-wax
embedded and sliced into 2 mm-thick sec-
tions. Sections were deparaffinized, micro-
wave recovered in sodium citrate solution
for 15 min and washed three times at 37C
(10 min each wash) with 1 Â phosphate buf-
fered saline (PBS; 10 mM, pH 7.2).
Endogenous peroxide was inhibited by incu-
bation in 30 ml/l hydrogen peroxide for
10 min, then slides were washed three times
with PBS (37C, 10 min each wash), and
blocked in normal goat serum at room
temperature for 20 min. Sections were incu-
bated with primary antibody (rat antihuman
NHERF1 monoclonal antibody, 1 : 50 dilu-
tion or rat anti-human b-catenin monoclo-
nal antibody, 1 : 40 dilution; both Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA,
USA) or negative control (PBS) overnight
at 4C, washed three times with PBS (37C,
10 min each wash) and incubated with
630 Journal of International Medical Research 43(5)
horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat
antirat immunoglobulin (Ig)G (1 : 1200 dilu-
tion; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 37C for
10 min. After washing three times with PBS
(37C, 10 min each wash), slides were incu-
bated with streptavidin­peroxidase (Sigma­
Aldrich; St Louis, MO, USA) at 37C for
10 min and washed three times with PBS
(37C, 10 min each wash). Slides were
stained with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB),
counterstained with haematoxylin, dehy-
drated and sealed.
Staining was semiquantitatively analysed
using Image-ProÕ Plus version 6.0 (Media
Cybernetics, Rockville, MD, USA). For
each section, five visual fields (magnifica-
tion Â 400) were randomly selected. Cells
with yellow-brown particles in the cyto-
plasm were classified as positive. Image-
ProÕ Plus software determined the
integrated optical density (IOD), and aver-
age optical density (AOD) was calculated as
IOD/total area of visual field.
Western blotting
Kidney tissue samples were temporarily
stored in liquid nitrogen, placed in radio-
immunoprecipitation assay buffer (pH
7.4 Æ 0.1), homogenized on ice, and centri-
fuged at 10 000 Â g at 4C for 10 min. The
supernatant was collected and protein con-
centration was determined using BCA pro-
tein assay kit (Sigma­Aldrich). Equal
quantities of protein per lane were separated
by sodium dodecyl sulphate­polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF
membrane (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA),
then blocked in 5% skimmed milk in
200 nM Tris-HCl with 1.37 M sodium chlor-
ide and 10% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at
37C). Membranes were incubated with
rabbit antihuman NHERF1 polyclonal anti-
body (1 : 1000 dilution), rabbit antihuman b-
catenin polyclonal antibody (1 : 900
dilution) or rat antihuman glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
monoclonal antibody (1 : 2000 dilution; all
Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at
4C, then washed three times with TBST
(37C, 15 min each wash). Membranes were
incubated with horseradish peroxidase con-
jugated goat antirabbit IgG or goat antirat
IgG (1 : 5000 dilution; Both Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies) for 1 h at 37C, washed
five times with TBST (37C, 10 min each
wash), and developed in the dark using
enhanced chemiluminescence (Sigma
ECLTM Prime Western Blotting System;
Sigma­Aldrich). Protein bands were
scanned with ImageQuantTM TL (GE
Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), and
NHERF1 and b-catenin were semiquanti-
fied by reference to GAPDH.
Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR
Total RNA was extracted from Han:SPRD
rat kidney tissue (100mg, stored temporarily
in liquid nitrogen) using 1 ml TRIzolÕ (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), then
(1mg) reverse transcribed in a 10ml reaction
mix (2mg RNA, 1 ml oligo(dT), 1 ml dNTP
mix, 6 ml RNase free double distilled water.
Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
using a 7700 PCR system (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a 25-ml
reaction mix comprising 12.5 ml of
2 Â Premix Ex Taq, 1 ml each primer, 1 ml
cDNA, and 9.5 ml double distilled water). The
cycling programme involved preliminary
denaturation at 95C for 10min, followed
by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 10s,
annealing at 60C for 30s, and elongation at
72C for 20s. Primer sequences were

Proliferation and apoptosis assays
The human ADPKD cyst-lining epithelial
cell line WT9­1213 was cultured in 1 : 1
Dulbecco's modified Eagles' medium
(DMEM)/F12 (Life Technologies), contain-
ing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1000 IU/ml
penicillin and 100 IU/ml streptomycin, at
37C in 5% carbon dioxide in air. Cells were
passaged every 2­3 days until they adhered
to the culture vessel.
Cell proliferation assays were performed
in quadruplicate. Adherent cells were inocu-
lated into 96-well plates at 4000 cells/well,
synchronized in serum-free DMEM/F12
culture medium for 24 h, then incubated
with 50, 100, 200 or 400 ng/ml recombinant
human NHERF1 (OriGene, Rockville, MD,
USA) for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h. MTT solution
(10 ml of 5 g/l) was added and cells were
incubated for a further 4 h, the super-
natant was discarded, 100 ml of dimethyl
sulphoxide was added and the plates were
shaken for 10 min. Optical density at
490 nm was measured using a microplate
reader, and the cell proliferation rate
(%) was calculated as [1 ­ (ODcontrol
­
ODexperiment
)/ODcontrol
] Â 100%.
Apoptosis assays were performed in
quadruplicate. WT9-12 cells were inoculated
onto 6-well plates at 2 Â 105 cells/well,
synchronized in serum-free DMEM/F12
culture medium for 24 h after 60­70% cell
fusion, then incubated with 50, 100, 200 or
400 ng/ml recombinant human NHERF1
(OriGene) for 72 h. The culture medium
was discarded, and cells were digested with
0.25% trypsin/EDTA, pelleted by centrifu-
gation (conducted at 4C, three cycles of
8 min per cycle, 12000 g), then dissociated
into single-cell suspensions. Cells were
added to cold 70% ethanol, fixed overnight
at 4C, stained in the dark with 50 ml of
50 mg/l propidium iodide, and evaluated
using flow cytometry (CoulterÕ EpicsÕ
XLTM; Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA,
USA). Flow cytometry data were analysed
with MultiCycle AV-OCX-De Novo
Software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San
Diego, CA, USA).
Statistical analyses
All experiments were performed in quadru-
plicate, and data were expressed as
mean Æ SD. Intra- and inter-group compari-
sons were conducted using analysis of vari-
ance and Student's t-test, respectively. Data
were analysed using SPSSÕ version 13.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. P-values < 0.05 were considered
statistically significant.
Results
The study included kidney tissue samples
from six patients with ADPKD (3 male and
3 female; average age 52.2 Æ 2.3 years) and
six control subjects (4 male and 2 female;
average age 55.7 Æ 1.3 years).
Immunohistochemical staining of control
human kidney tissue found that NHERF1
was located in the cytoplasm of epithelial
cells from the distal convoluted tubule, but
not the glomerulus. Control samples had
visibly higher levels of NHERF1 staining
than samples from patients with ADPKD
(Figure 1); AOD analysis confirmed this
finding (1.41 Æ 0.27 in controls versus
0.42 Æ 0.13 in patients; P < 0.01). Levels of
b-catenin were visibly higher in the cyto-
plasm of distal convoluted tubular epithelial
cells from patients with ADPKD (Figure
2(b)) and WT9­12 cells (Figure 2(c)), com-
pared with controls (Figure 2(a)). The b-
catenin AOD was significantly higher in
ADPKD patients than in controls
(1.36 Æ 0.23 versus 0.26 Æ 0.24; P < 0.01).
Levels of NHERF1 protein were signifi-
cantly lower in patients with ADPKD

Discussion
Polycystic kidney disease is a monogenic
hereditary disease that is classified into
autosomal-dominant and autosomal-reces-
sive forms. ADPKD accounts for $85% of
cases and is typified by the formation of
bilateral progressive renal fluid-filled cysts,
resulting from tumour-like proliferation and
abnormal apoptosis of cyst-lining epithelial
cells.14,15
As a tumour-like disease, ADPKD may
be closely associated with carcinogenesis.
Clear ectopic expression of b-catenin has
been observed in kidney tissues from a
murine model of ADPKD; this activated
the Wnt signalling pathway and facilitated
abnormal cell proliferation.16 In addition,
functional changes in the PCI/E-cadherin/b-
catenin complex altered cell polarity and

induced formation of renal cysts.16 Mice
that overexpress the b-catenin gene in
kidney epithelial cells have been shown to
have symptoms similar to ADPKD,17 pro-
viding a possible link between cyst forma-
tion, and excessive cell proliferation and
apoptosis. Mutation and depletion of APC
(adenomatous polyposis coli) in the b-
catenin destruction complex (GSK3D­
Axin­APC) has been shown to induce cyst
formation,6 and abnormal activation of the
Wnt signalling pathway is known to play a
critical role in ADPKD onset.4
The 358-amino acid protein NHERF1
contains an amino-terminal end tandem
PDZ domain (i.e. PDZ-1 and PDZ-2) and
a carboxyl-terminal end domain that binds
proteins in the ERM family via typical
protein­protein interactions.18 Located on
the membrane of normal epithelial cells,

NHERF1 is distributed in the cytoplasm or
nucleus of tumour cells, such as hepatoma
HepG2 cells.19 It is thought that NHERF1
may have different roles, depending on its
cellular location.20­22 In addition, NHERF1
affects b-catenin, which in turn participates
in the onset and progression of
ADPKD.5,6,17
The present study examined the differ-
ences in NHERF1 and b-catenin protein
and mRNA levels between diseased and
healthy (paracancerous) kidney tissue,
and found that patients with ADPKD and
Han:SPRD (cy/þ) rats had significantly less
NHERF1 protein and mRNA than control
subjects and animals, respectively. In con-
trast, b-catenin protein and mRNA levels
were significantly higher in patients with
ADPKD and Han:SPRD (cy/þ) rats than in
control subjects and animals. In addition,
levels of NHERF1 mRNA were significantly
lower, and b-catenin mRNA levels were
significantly higher, in (cy/þ) rats than (þ/
þ) animals aged 8­24 weeks in the present
study. It is possible that abnormal NHERF1
and b-catenin expression in ADPKD kid-
ney tissue may promote the expression of
cell proliferation genes, and lead to
renal cysts.
Treating WT9­12 cells with human
recombinant NHERF1 inhibited prolifer-
ation and arrested cells in the G0
/G1
phase,
in the present study. This finding may
provide new avenues for ADPKD
treatment.
In conclusion, ADPKD is associated with
a decrease in NHERF1 protein and mRNA
levels; supplementing exogenous NHERF1
inhibited the proliferation of WT9­12 cells.
These findings provide experimental evi-
dence for clarifying the pathogenesis of
ADPKD and for developing new treatment
options.
