AS adults progress through their later years, many note
declines in their ability to recall bits of information
and perform mental calculations. Though reflections about
cognitive aging are expected to grow more pessimistic with
the passage of chronological time, people's life courses
elapse in ways besides objective days, months, calendar,
and years. Therefore, age identity may be a more telling
indicator of dispositions toward cognitive aging than is
chronological age per se. Subjective evaluations of age are
an important aspect of the self with implications for well-
being (Westerhof & Barrett, 2005). Using a national longi-
tudinal sample of adults aged 55­74 years at baseline, this
article considers how age identity is associated with dispo-
sitions toward cognitive aging and how the relationship dif-
fers by gender.
Social psychologists in sociology see identities as "sets
of meanings people hold for themselves that define `what it
means' to be who they are" (Burke, 2004, p. 5). Culture
gives definition and meaning to positions within society,
and people place these labels and expectations on them-
selves and on others. Of the various cultural categories from
which people derive their identities, age is unique in that it
is far more permeable than categories like race or gender,
and because all people invariably increase in age over time,
age identity bridges both developmental and cultural as-
pects of human life (Howard, 2000).
The age-based identities generated within a social con-
text powerfully shape people's well-being. In modern cul-
tures, youthfulness is a prized status, and accordingly,
ageism and negative stereotypes of aging abound in the
United States (Palmore, 2003). Eschewing "oldness" and
preserving a youthful identity are therefore compensatory
strategies people use to counteract the negative cultural
messages associated with aging and the realization of being
past their own desired chronological age (Heckhausen &
Schulz, 1998). Generally speaking, people use positive self-
illusions as a strategy to maximize happiness and social en-
gagement (Taylor & Brown, 1988). The consistent finding
that people most identify with their "younger selves"
(Barrett, 2003; Barrett, 2005; Uotinen, Rantanen, Suutama,
& Ruoppila, 2006; Westerhof & Barrett, 2005) is a strong
example of self-enhancing illusions at the basis of the self-
concept (Markus & Wurf, 1987).
Consistent with these basic social psychological prem-
ises, a number of recent studies show the beneficial effects
of young age identities. These include qualitative benefits
such as efficacy in coping with medical illnesses (Boehmer,
2007) and general life satisfaction (Westerhof & Barrett,
2005), as well as more concrete advantages such as reduced
risk of disability and hypertension (Demakakos, Gjonca, &
Nazroo, 2007) and mortality (Uotinen, Rantanen, &
Suutama, 2005). Despite a few exceptions (Boehmer;
Demakakos et al., 2007; Uotinen et al., 2006), most research
has used cross-sectional data to examine the antecedents of
age identity, identifying health status and occupancy of key
social roles in the life course as its chief predictors (e.g.,
Barrett, 2003, 2005; Johnson, Berg, & Sirotzki, 2007;
Mutran & George, 1982). This article seeks to explore
Age Identity, Gender, and Perceptions of Decline: Does
Feeling Older Lead to Pessimistic Dispositions About
Cognitive Aging?

Objectives. Drawing on past studies of age identity, this article examined whether feeling older was associated with
more pessimistic views about cognitive aging.
Methods. Using respondents aged 55 years and older in the Midlife Development in the United States study, we esti-
mated a series of linear regression models to predict people's dispositions toward their cognitive aging. The main com-
parison is whether the effects of age identity on cognitive aging differ for men and women.
Results. Beyond the effects of chronological age, older age identities were associated with more pessimistic disposi-
tions about cognitive aging. This relationship, however, was found only among women.
Discussion. Age identity shapes cognitive aging dispositions, though the gendered nature of this relationship remains
somewhat unclear. The findings give further evidence about the far-reaching implications of age identity for successful
aging and suggest that future work can explicate how subjective aging processes may differ by gender.
Key Words: Age identity--Cognitive aging--Cognitive decline--Gender--Subjective age.

additional implications of age identity for successful aging
by using longitudinal data and focusing on how subjective
age influences cognitive aging dispositions (hereafter CAD).
We expect not only that age identity is related to aspects of
physical well-being (Barrett, 2003; Demakakos et al.; Uotinen
et al., 2005) but that older subjective age is associated with
more pessimistic perspectives on cognitive functioning, net
of the effect of chronological age.
Cognitive aging is a key component of successful aging,
with strong implications for quality of life and maintaining
independence in older age (Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, &
Berkman, 2001). Exploring CAD thus extends previous re-
search, which has emphasized the physical health correlates
of age identity but has given little attention to the mind. In
addressing this limitation of past research, we draw on scale
instruments developed by psychologists of aging (Lachman,
Baltes, Nesselroade, & Willis, 1982; Lachman, Bandura,
Weaver, & Elliott, 1992) that are useful for identifying the
self-regulatory attitudes that influence cognitive perfor-
mance (West & Yassuda, 2004). This research tradition has
been instrumental in identifying why older adults fare worse
on cognitive tasks; in addition to explanations based on
brain and sensory changes (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997),
part of the effect owes to the lower levels of perceived con-
trol over their cognitive abilities and negative internalized
attributions for memory performance (Devolder & Pressley,
1992; Lachman & Andreoletti, 2006). Psychologists in the
area of CAD have been interested primarily in the personal-
ity attributes associated with these attitudes, such as anxiety or
achievement orientation (e.g., Lachman et al., 1982) and--
more recently--in identifying the mechanisms linking
cognitive expectations to performance (e.g., better use of
recall-enhancing learning strategies [Lachman, Andreoletti,
& Pearman, 2006] and level of confidence in information
retrieval [Touron & Hertzog, 2004]). Our core concern here,
however, is with age identity and how it relates to CAD.
Which matters more for people's outlook on cognitive ag-
ing--an objective count of chronological years or their own
evaluations of their age?
In pursuing this inquiry, we draw specific attention to
gender differences. Identities are located at the intersection
of a multiplicity of traits--race, gender, age, and so on
(Howard, 2000), and as an aspect of the self, age percep-
tions differ in important ways between men and women.
Barrett (2005) shows that women tend to be subjectively
older than men because of their worse health and limited
control over their personal relationships. Women are also
especially prone to ageist stereotypes (Hurd, 1999) and are
frequently evaluated on traits associated with youthfulness
such as physical beauty and sexual appeal (Barrett, 2005).
The importance of gender is further underscored by studies
on aging self-perceptions. Lynch (2000), for instance, devel-
oped a construct of age anxiety including six concerns--
health,fearofthefuture,anduneaseoverlossofindependence,
among other things. Overall, women were higher in age
anxiety, though the effect was more marked among younger
adults. Relating to cognitive aging, past research also docu-
ments that women tend to be less confident about their own
cognitive abilities (West,Welch, & Knabb, 2002)and that older
women, but not older men, are stereotyped as passive and cog-
nitively incompetent (Canetto, Kaminski, & Felicio, 1995).
Taken together, research on age identity and cognitive ag-
ing perceptions suggests that the salience of internalized
age-based concerns and age-related social evaluations are
shaped by gender. Based on the findings discussed earlier,
this suggests that the association between age and threats to
well-being (e.g., declining health, cognitive incompetence)
is most pronounced among women. Essentially, this con-
ceptualization predicts an interactive association; we there-
fore expect age identity's most negative effects on CAD to
be observed among women.
Bringing together the concepts of age identity, CAD, and
gender is valuable because age-based expectations are im-
portant in adult development. This has been ably docu-
mented by Levy and colleagues (2002, 2003), who found
that positive self-perceptions about growing older improve
health and increase longevity. Insights from social psychol-
ogy such as the self-fulfilling prophecy posit that people's
expectation for their futures matter; whether one is fatalistic
or optimistic about one's future cognitive status likely shapes
one's course of development. Indeed, negative dispositions
about memory abilities compromise memory performance,
particularly among older adults (West & Yassuda, 2004).
Data and Methods
Sample
Data are drawn from two waves of phone- and self-
administered questionnaire data from the National Survey
of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS). Ini-
tial data were collected from 1995 to 1996 from a sampling
frame of all English-speaking noninstitutionalized adults
aged 25­74 years in the contiguous 48 states. The response
rate for Wave 1 (W1) was 61%, producing a total sample of
3,034 participants.
Respondents were then contacted 10 years later in 2005
to secure their participation for Wave 2 (W2). Of the com-
pleteW1 sample, 2,103 individuals were followed up (69%).
This rate differed, however, by key attributes: Only 58% of
Black respondents were followed up versus 70% of non-
Black persons, about 71% of women remained in the study
compared with 68% of men, and participants who were re-
tained had scored 1 unit higher on education. This study
focuses only on adults 55­74 years of age at W1, who had
similar retention rates to the overall sample. Sixty-four
cases with item-missing data from baseline or follow-up
were dropped from the analyses, leaving a final study sam-
ple of 496 respondents. Poststratification weights were used
in all multivariate analyses.
AGE IDENTITY AND COGNITIVE AGING DISPOSITIONS 93
Cognitive Aging Dispositions
Dispositions toward cognitive aging were assessed with a
six-item scale reflecting individuals'attitudes about changes
in their ability to perform various cognitive tasks as they age
(a = .78). The items were taken from larger subscales of the
Personality in IntellectualAging Context instrument (Lachman
et al., 1982) and the Memory Controllability Inventory
(Lachman et al., 1992). They include: "It's inevitable that
my intellectual functioning will decline as I get older"; "The
older I get, the harder it is to think clearly"; "My mental
acuity (sharpness) is bound to decline"; "I don't remember
things as well as I used to"; "There's not much I can do to
keep my memory from going down hill"; and "I can under-
stand instructions only after someone explains them to me."
High scores correspond with more optimistic dispositions
toward cognitive aging. We selected these six questions out
of a total of nine cognitive aging items in the MIDUS sur-
vey after conducting an iterated principal factor analysis
and identifying a one-factor solution. Reliability was also
highest when using this particular six-item configuration.
Age Identity
Age identity was measured by subtracting chronological
age from the response to the following question: "Many
people feel older or younger than they actually are. What
age do you feel most of the time?" (Barrett, 2003, 2005;
Westerhof & Barrett, 2005). This results in negative values
reflecting younger subjective ages and positive values re-
flecting older subjective age relative to chronological age.
The observed range was -39 to 13.
Additional Variables
Our analyses control for a host of variables known to
shape age identity, such as health status, familial role posi-
tions, and participation in the work force, along with demo-
graphic covariates. Variables included age, race (1 = Black;
0 = other), sex (1 = female; 0 = male), education (years of
education, ranging from 1 to 12), and one's occupational
standing (1 = has worked or is working in a white-collar
occupation; 0 = has not worked in a white-collar occupa-
tion). We accounted for employment status (1 = working; 0
= unemployed), marital status (1 = married; 0 = otherwise),
and parental status (1 = has children; 0 = does not have
children). We also controlled for health indicators: physical
health (self-rated, ranging from 1 to 5), disability (a nine-
item scale, a = .87), and negative affect (six-item scale, a =
.82). We included a general indicator of perceived control as
it is associated with maintenance of cognitive abilities
(Verhaeghen, Geraerts, & Marcoen, 2000). Perceived control
is based on a 12-item scale assessing the amount of control
respondents had in their life, such as "In general I feel I am
in charge of the situations in which I live." The scale had an
intra-item reliability of .84 and was moderately correlated
with the CAD measure (r = .38; as well as with age [r =
-.16] and age identity [r = -.18]). Finally, we incorporated
a sum of cognitively engaging activities measuring the
count of activities respondents participated in at least sev-
eral times a month. These include word games, lectures or
courses, and writing (e.g., letters, journals) or computer
use.
Analytic Strategy
The research plan is relatively straightforward. After pre-
senting descriptive statistics of our overall study sample, as
well as the differences between men and women, we esti-
mate linear regression equations separately for men and
women. A t test is used to test differences in slopes across
the two subsamples. The key comparison is whether the ef-
fect of age identity on CAD differs between men and
women.
Results
Table 1 presents means and standard deviations for the
variables used in the analysis. Overall, respondents reported
age identities that were younger than their chronological age,
with women feeling relatively younger than men (-12.5 com-
pared with -11.5), although this difference was not signifi-
cant. In general, men and women had similar expectations
about CAD. Though not displayed in a table, there was a
modest level of correlation between CAD and key indepen-
dent variables (r = -.20 with age identity; r = -.15 with age).
In Table 2, we present linear regression models examin-
ing the effects of age identity on CAD for men and women,
reporting both unstandardized and standardized coefficients.
Results show that among women, age identity was a strong
predictor of CAD, as a 1-unit increase in subjective age was
associated with a .15 CAD decrease. Comparing standard-
ized units, the beta coefficient for age identity was actually
slightly larger than that of age in its objective measurement
(.18 compared with .15). Older women and those with nega-
tive affect were more pessimistic toward cognitive aging,
but those with more education and greater sense of control
tended to be more optimistic about cognitive aging.
Interestingly, we did not observe a statistically significant
relationship between age identity and CAD among men.
Similarly, chronological age did not predict CAD. However,
a t test of the slopes failed to reveal a statistically significant
difference for age identity between men and women. Other
predictors of cognitive aging remained similar to those for
women, with two exceptions: Among men, those in better
health were more negative about their cognitive aging (slope
was significantly different than that for women, p < .05),
and education was not a significant predictor of CAD.
Discussion
This article found that age identity has a strong influence
on CAD above and beyond individuals' chronological age,

educational status, health, demographic factors, sense of
control, and participation in cognitively engaging activities.
Age identity is increasingly noted as an important
component of the self, with key implications for health and
well-being (e.g., Demakakos et al., 2007). In short, youthful
identities are prized and not easily relinquished (Barrett,
2005; Westerhof & Barrett, 2005). Part of youth's appeal--
in addition to its association with physical vigor--is mental
acuity. Not surprisingly, those with younger age identities
were found to be more optimistic about their ability to
maintain memory and other aspects of cognitive ability,
regardless of their objective age.
The effect of age identity on CAD, however, is not consis-
tent across gender lines; the standardized coefficient for age
identity was nearly twice as large for women and was non-
significant for male respondents. Nevertheless, testing the
slope differences failed to reveal statistically significant dif-
ferences between men and women. (Preliminary analyses
[available upon request] with the full sample [women and
men] showed that the effect of age identity on CAD was
significant [b = -.134; p < .05] and essentially the average of
the standardized effects of women and men separately.) This
suggests that though subjective evaluations of age seem
more closely tied to evaluations of mental functioning among

women, we cannot rule out the possibility that the effects are
actually equal across groups. Greater statistical power would
enable better tests of subsample differences between men
and women. (The heterogeneity of error variance between
male and female subsamples suggests that there is a rather
modest level of statistical power for detecting significant dif-
ferences in age identity in CAD between women and men.)
In addition, it is important to note that we did not observe
differences in CAD between men and women at the bivari-
ate level. Likewise, bivariate comparisons failed to reveal an
age identity difference between genders.
Future studies may take up the issue of gender and age
identity more broadly. Scholars have rightly emphasized
that physical appearance and its presumed age-based dete-
rioration is a predominant aging concern among women in
American society (e.g., Barrett, 2005); however, unease
over mental competence and memory ability may also be
key concerns among women as they sense themselves ag-
ing. Indeed, women are more concerned about aging in gen-
eral (Lynch, 2000) and have been found to be less confident
about their cognitive abilities in specific (West et al., 2002).
Future research can further clarify how age identity and
gender interact to influence the pressures and uncertainties
of aging.
Several limitations of this study must be kept in mind.
First, the data did not include measures of individuals' cog-
nitive abilities (e.g., memory tests or math puzzles), thwart-
ing our ability to examine how age identity affects actual
cognitive performance in later life. Prior research, however,
indicates that evaluative expectations have concrete effects
on a person's future (West & Yassuda, 2004). Second, we
were limited in our ability to examine racial/ethnic differ-
ences in CAD due to the small number of minorities in the
MIDUS data. Other research could examine how the rela-
tionship between age identity and CAD varies by race/eth-
nicity in addition to gender. Third, CAD was not measured
at W1. This precludes the ability to include baseline CAD
as a regressor and thereby measure change in the evalua-
tions over 10 years. We anticipate that people with older age
identities would grow increasingly pessimistic about cogni-
tive aging over time, though additional measures for the de-
pendent variable are necessary to test this assumption.
Fourth, our measure of age identity is but one among many
possible ways to operationalize this concept. For instance,
others have conceptualized age identity as how one identi-
fies with a discrete age category, such as "middle-age" or
"old" (e.g., Mutran & George, 1982). Though it would have
been desirable to broaden our analysis with the use of ad-
ditional measures, we did not have other options available
in our data.
Despite these limitations, our approach made several
contributions. First, this article has expanded the literature on
age identity, exploring domains of life affected by age identity
other than physical health or general well-being and present-
ing the differences by gender. Cognitive aging dispositions
are an important aspect of aging because the maintenance of
cognitive functioning sustains engagement in life activities
and social relationships. Furthermore, positive expectations
about aging confer tangible protective benefits across a va-
riety of life domains (Levy, 2003; Levy et al., 2002, 2003;
West & Yassuda, 2004). Our results show that age identity
strongly shapes such dispositions, having as much or more
of an impact than objective age, though this relationship
was observed only among women.
Second, this article used a longitudinal design, enabling
us to prospectively examine the effects of age identity.
Though past research has identified important antecedents
and consequences of age identity, most prior studies have
used cross-sectional data (e.g., Barrett, 2003; Barrett, 2005;
Westerhof & Barrett, 2005).
Finally, most life course and aging scholars privilege
chronological age as a key indicator of developmental
change. Though the passage of years since one's birth is one
way to conceptualize age and aging, there are multiple
forms of time-based experience. This study illustrates the
utility of age identity as an important way to capture ex-
pected change in the later life course, suggesting that future
research might fruitfully explore other implications of self-
concept among aging individuals.
