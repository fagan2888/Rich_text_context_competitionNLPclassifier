Since a significant number of lymphomas have been associated with the human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV), the purpose of this study was to describe the impact of HIV
infection on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) mortality trends and demographics. Mul-
tiple-cause-of-death data for the United States from 1979 through 1996 were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion. Annual NHL deaths rates for the United States were calculated as the number of NHL
deaths per 100,000 persons, based on estimates of the U.S. resident population. The time
periods 1979­1982, 1986­1989, and 1993­1996 were examined for changes over time. To
describe NHL and HIV infection mortality, the characteristics of NHL deaths with HIV
infection listed anywhere on the death records were examined beginning in 1987. This
study found that despite reports of a lower incidence rate of NHL among blacks with
HIV/AIDS, death rates from lymphomas associated with HIV/AIDS have markedly in-
creased in black males and females over time. It was also noted that in agreement with
other studies, this study documented a decrease in NHL/HIV mortality in 1996. Am. J.

INTRODUCTION
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) comprises a bio-
logically diverse group of hematologic malignancies,
with clinical courses ranging from indolent to highly ag-
gressive [1]. It has been estimated that for 1998 more
than 62,000 new cases of NHL will be diagnosed in the
United States [2], with NHL-related deaths being ranked
seventh among all cancer deaths.
In the last 30 years the reported incidence of NHL
markedly increased and has nearly doubled since the
early 1970s. Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology
and End Results (SEER) data base indicate a 50% in-
crease in the NHL incidence from 1973 to 1987 [3].
Although the reasons for this increase are not fully un-
derstood, a significant number of NHL cases are linked
to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epi-
demic [4­6], thus contributing to the high incidence. The
predisposition of immunosuppressed individuals to de-
velop NHL has long been recognized. Transplant recipi-
ents who have received immunosuppressive therapy have
been reported to have a 28­49 times greater incidence in
NHL compared to that of the general population [7].
Similarly, individuals with congenital immunodeficiency
syndromes have approximately 100 times greater risk of
developing NHL [1,8]. The association of lymphomas
with AIDS was first observed in 1982 [9,10], and in 1985
NHL was included in the AIDS case definition [11].
Although the 5-year survival rate for persons with
NHL has increased in recent years, the mortality rate has
also increased [12]. Since a significant number of lym-
phomas are associated with the human immunodeficien-
cy disease (HIV), the purpose of this study was to de-

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Multiple-cause-of-death data for the United States
from 1979 through 1996 were obtained from the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) [13]. NHL deaths were
defined as those in which any of the codes 200.0, 200.1,
200.2, 200.8, 202.8, and 202.9 from the International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), were
listed anywhere on the death record as a cause of death
[13­17].
Annual NHL death rates for the United States were
calculated as the number of NHL deaths per 100,000
persons, based on estimates of the U.S. resident popula-
tion [18]. The rates were standardized by the direct
method using the 1990 census population [19]. Age-
adjusted annual death rates were calculated by year, sex,
race, time period, and region [20]. Risk ratios (RRs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by Pois-
son regression analysis [21]. The time periods 1979­
1982, 1986­1989, and 1993­1996 were examined for
changes over time. To examine age differences, we used
10-year age categories from ages 0­9 through 70­79, and
ages 80+ years. Geographic comparisons were analyzed
by standard census regions: Northeast, Midwest, West,
and South.
To describe NHL and HIV infection mortality, we ex-
amined the characteristics of NHL deaths with HIV in-
fection listed anywhere on death records beginning in
1987. NHL deaths with and without HIV infection listed
were also described by all three time periods. HIV in-
fection was defined as ICD-9 codes 042.0­044.9, 136.3,
279.1, 279.3, 279.9, and 795.8 to allow for underreport-
ing of HIV infection [21]. Rates for NHL with HIV were
calculated as the number of lymphoma deaths with HIV
per 100,000 U.S. resident population.
RESULTS
Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Mortality Trends
From 1979 through 1996, 372,569 NHL deaths were
recorded in the United States. The annual age-adjusted
death rate for NHL increased 48.5% from 6.8/100,000
persons in 1979­1982 to 10.1/100,000 persons in 1993­
1996 (Table I).
Throughout the 18-year study period, the age-adjusted
annual NHL death rate increased more than 53% for
males but only 39% for females (Table I). Although the
NHL death rate was lower for blacks and other races than
for whites, rates increased for all races from 1979 to
1996. However, the highest increase in the NHL death

rate throughout the study period. The number of NHL
deaths increased for all age groups above 19 years. The

1993­1996, black males had a greater percentage of de-
cedants in the age groups under age 50 than did black
females, white males, or white females (Fig. 1). Corre-
spondingly, black females had a greater percentage of
decedants in the age groups under 60 than did white
females (Fig. 1). However, after age 60, white males had
the highest death rate, while the same was true for white
females after age 70 (Fig. 1). A similar pattern with
respect to age was seen when race and sex were grouped
together by age (Table I).
Geographically, the South had the lowest NHL death
rates overall but the greatest increase in number of NHL
deaths. The Northeast had the highest rates overall (Ta-
ble I).
Influence of HIV on Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
HIV infection has had a profound impact on the NHL
death rate. When HIV was first listed with NHL as a
cause of death during 1986­1989, the death rate for per-
sons with NHL and HIV was 0.4/100,000; this rate in-
creased to 0.8/100,000 during 1993­1996 (Table II). In
both time periods, 1986­1989 and 1993­1996, the age-
adjusted death rate for persons with NHL and HIV death
rate was much higher for males than that of females
(Table II). However, the percent increase in this rate from
1986­1989 to 1993­1996 was greater for females
(187.1%) than for males (129.9%). The age-adjusted
NHL/HIV death rate though similar in 1986­1989 for
whites and blacks, was substantially higher for blacks

(1.4/100,000) as compared to whites (0.8/100,000) in
1993­1996 but both were higher still than that for other
races (Table II).
The relationship between NHL, NHL/HIV, and mor-
tality with respect to race is illustrated in Figure 2. As
shown in Fig. 2A, the age-adjusted death rate for NHL
increased over time, with blacks having lower rate than
whites. But for NHL/HIV, blacks had the higher age-
adjusted death rate than did whites (Fig. 2B). The in-
crease in NHL/HIV associated mortality peaked in 1994
for blacks after which a modest decrease was observed
(Fig. 2B). The overall death rate for NHL/HIV did also
decrease in 1996 after reaching a peak in 1994­1995
(Fig. 2B). When NHL/HIV age-adjusted death rates were
analyzed by both race and sex, black males shared the
greatest increase in death rates over time and white fe-
males the lowest (Fig. 3). By age group, the highest rates
of NHL/HIV deaths occurred among those 30­49 years
of age during 1986­1989 and 1993­1996, with the 30­39
age group having the highest increases in deaths (Table
II). When age was examined in terms of race and sex, the
NHL/HIV death rate in the 30­39 age group was similar
for white and black males, but compared to white fe-
males, black females had a markedly higher death rate
(Fig. 4).
Geographically, the NHL death rates were highest in
the West and Northeast. However, all regions demon-
strated a marked increase in the NHL/HIV death rate
from 1986­1989 to 1993­1996 with the South having the
greatest increase (162.1%) (Table II).
Comparison of NHL decedents with and without HIV-
associated disease showed the profound impact of HIV
on NHL deaths (Table III). Whites had higher proportion
of deaths overall through the three time periods, but
when HIV was included as a contributory cause of death,
blacks with HIV had a higher proportion of deaths that
increased both over time as compared to blacks without
HIV (Table III). During 1993­1996, most deaths oc-
curred to those 70­79 years of age among non-HIV
NHL; however, among NHL deaths with HIV most de-
cedants were 30­39 years of age. This pattern was ob-
served for the years 1986­1989 as well. The West had
more deaths of NHL/HIV, while the South had more
NHL/non-HIV deaths.
DISCUSSION
For the past several decades, both the incidence [12]
and death rate for NHL have increased, making it the
most rapidly increasing of all neoplastic diseases in the
United States. Although the reason(s) for these increases
are not entirely known, the epidemic of HIV/AIDS has
substantially contributed to the increases in reported in-
cidence and death from NHL [22]. Through the use of
mortality data complied from death certificates, this
study demonstrates the significant effect of HIV has had
on the NHL death rate and shows that despite previous
reports of a lower incidence of NHL among blacks with
HIV/AIDS, the death rates among persons with HIV-
related disease have been markedly higher for blacks
than for whites.
For the last 50 years, NHL incidence and mortality has

NHL/HIV Mortality 163
been higher among whites and among males [12]. More
recent incidence data have suggested a similar pattern for
persons with both AIDS and NHL [23]. The data pre-
sented here demonstrate an increase in the NHL death
rates for males and females as well as for whites and
blacks. This upward trend in mortality during the 18-year
study period was not surprising given the reported in-
crease in NHL incidence [12]. Also parallel to the re-
ported incidence data [12] was the observation that males
had the greatest increase in NHL deaths. Whereas whites
have been reported to have the highest incidence of NHL
[12,24], this study found that although blacks had a lower
NHL death rate than whites they had the greatest in-
creases in mortality. Despite a reported low NHL inci-
dence in the South [22] and a significant increase in the
Midwest [25], this study found no marked differences in
death rates among the four regions of the United States.
Approximately 10% of current NHL cases have been
estimated to be AIDS related [23]. Reflective of the NHL
incidence rate for the U.S. population, reports have in-
dicated that among individuals with HIV/AIDS, the risk
for NHL is lower for blacks than for whites [22,24]. A
similar decrease in NHL risk was seen for drug users
with HIV/AIDS [24]. These observations have led some
to suggest a lower NHL risk for individuals of lower
socioeconomic status [22] and that being black is protec-
tive [24]. However, mortality rates present a different
picture from that of incidence data. The markedly higher
death rate observed for both black males and females
may however be attributed to the increased incidence of
AIDS among this population [26­28]. Also the increase
in death among white females may also be due to the
increased AIDS incidence that has occurred among fe-
males overall [28]. Since the prognosis for HIV/AIDS
patients with NHL is poor [29], it is doubtful that pos-
sible differences in health care access has had any sig-
nificant effect on the mortality rate. However, we cannot
exclude lack of health care access as a contributing cause
to the increased mortality rate for blacks. We also cannot
exclude reporting differences in the coding of death cer-
tificates or the possibility that a more aggressive subtype
of NHL may be more common in blacks.
It has previously been reported that the geographic
distribution of HIV/AIDS has had an effect on the re-
gional incidence of NHL. In three East Coast study sites,
the incidence of NHL increased 26% from 1981
through1988, with persons with AIDS accounting for
24% of this increase [30]. During the same reporting
period in San Francisco, PWA were responsible for 66%
of a 73% increase in newly diagnosed cases of NHL [30].
Detailed analysis of the effect of HIV/AIDS on NHL
has been difficult to perform because of methodological
problems encountered in estimating the size of the risk
groups [30] and because NHL has also increased in

groups not considered at risk for HIV. In an early attempt
to differentiate between HIV-related NHL and non-HIV-
related lymphoma in New York City, Kristal et al. [31]
considered that factors other than HIV may have been
responsible for the increased incidence and mortality ob-
served for NHL. However, following incidence and mor-
tality analysis of females and never-married males,
Kristal et al. [31] did conclude that the increases in lym-
phoma seen in young males were probably due to HIV
infection and not to other causes.
The linkage of the Illinois AIDS and Cancer Registries
allowed Cote
´ et al. [32] to directly examine the relation-
ship between AIDS and cancer. This study found that
lymphomas (mixed lymphocytic/histiocytic) occurred at
80 times the expected rate in persons with AIDS. The
study also documented that among homosexual men with
AIDS, whites were more likely to have NHL than non-
whites. In a similar study linking the San Francisco AIDS
Surveillance Registry with the California Tumor Regis-
try, Reynolds et al. [33] found as compared to non-
whites, whites had a markedly higher NHL incidence.
The reason(s) for this apparent racial difference was not
known, but it could be speculated that differential racial
predispositions or differences in health care access could
be attributed to the low numbers of NHL found among
the non-white homosexual AIDS population as a conse-
quence of being under diagnosed.
CONCLUSION
The analysis of NHL mortality data presented here not
only supports and confirms findings from previous stud-
ies [12] but has also directly examined the influence of
HIV on NHL-associated mortality. One significant find-
ing from this study is that despite other reports of a lower
incidence rate of NHL among African-Americans with
HIV/AIDS, death rates from lymphomas associated with
HIV/AIDS have markedly increased in black males and
females over time. This observation parallels the higher
incidence of AIDS that has been reported for African-
Americans compared to whites [26­28]. Another impor-
tant finding was a decrease in NHL/HIV mortality ob-
served in 1996, the last year of the study. This finding,
which was in agreement with the recently documented
decrease in AIDS deaths, may be attributed to therapeutic
advances in antiviral therapy and treatment of opportu-
nistic infections [34].
